  PREFACE 
TuE present book is a careful revision of the edition of 1888. 
This revision was planned and actually begun in the lifetime of 
Professor Greenough and has been carried out in accordance 
with principles that met with his full approval. The renum- 
bering of the sections has made it possible to improve the 
arrangement of material in many particulars and to avoid a cer- 
tain amount of repetition which was inevitable in the former 
edition. Thus, without increasing the size of the volume, the 
editors have been able to include such new matter as the advance 
in grammatical science has afforded. The study of historical 
and comparative syntax has been pursued with considerable vigor 
during the past fifteen years, and the well-established results of 
this study have been inserted in their appropriate places. In 
general, however, the principles and facts of Latin syntax, as 
set forth by Professor Greenough, have stood the test both of 
scientific criticism and of practical use in the class-room, and 
accordingly the many friends of Allen and Greenough’s Gram- 
mar will not find the new edition strange or unfamiliar in its 
method or its contents. The editors have seen no occasion to 
change long-settled nomenclature or to adopt novel classifica- 
tions when the usual terms and categories have proved satis- 
factory. On the other hand, they have not hesitated to modify 
either doctrines or forms of statement whenever improvement 
seemed possible. 
In the matter of “ hidden quantity” the editors have been even 
more conservative than in the former revision. This subject is 
one of great difficulty, and the results of the most recent investi- 
gations are far from harmonious. In many instances the facts

  iv PREFACE 
are quite undiscoverable, and, in general, the phenomena are of 
comparatively slight interest except to special students of the 
arcana of philology. No vowel has been marked long unless the 
evidence seemed practically decisive. 
The editors have been fortunate in securing the advice and 
assistance of Professor E. 8. Sheldon, of Harvard University, for 
the first ten pages, dealing with phonetics and phonology. They 
are equally indebted to Professor E. P. Morris, of Yale Univer- 
sity, who has had the kindness to revise the notes on historical 
and comparative syntax. Particular acknowledgment is also 
due to Mr. M. Grant Daniell, who has codperated in the revision 
throughout, and whose accurate scholarship and long experience 
as a teacher have been of the greatest service at every point.

  LATIN GRAMMAR 
Latin Grammar is usually treated under three heads: 1. Words and 
Forms; 2. Syntax; 3. Prosody. Syntax treats of the function of words 
when joined together as parts of the sentence; Prosody of their arrange- 
ment in metrical composition. 
PART FIRST—WORDS AND FORMS 
THE ALPHABET 
1, The Latin Alphabet is the same as the English (which is 
in fact borrowed from it) except that it does not contain J, U, 
and W. 
Nore 1.—The Latin alphabet was borrowed in very early times from a Greek 
alphabet (though not from that most familiar to us) and did not at first contain the 
letters G and Y. It consisted of capital letters only, and the small letters with which 
we are familiar did not come into general use until the close of the eighth century of 
our era, 
Norg 2.—The Latin names of the consonants were as follows: —B, be (pronounced 
bay); C, ce (pronounced kay); D, de (day); F, ef; G, ge (gay); H, ha; K, ka; L, el; 
M, em; N, en; B, pe (pay); @ au (boo); R, en; S, es; B, te (tay); K, tw; Z, zeta (the Greek name, pronounced dzayta). The sound of each vowel was used as its name, 
a, The character C originally meant G, a value always retained in 
the abbreviations C. (for Gaius) and Cn. (for Gnaeus). 
Nors. —In early Latin C came also to be used for K, and K disappeared except be- 
fore a in a few words, as Kal, (Kalendae), Karthagd. Thus there was no distinction in 
writing between the sounds of g and k. Later this defect was remedied by forming 
(from ) the new character G. This took the alphabetic place formerly occupied by 
Z, which had gone out of use. In Cicero’s time (see N. D. ii, 93), ¥ (originally a form 
of V) and Z were introduced from the ordinary Greek alphabet to represent sounds in 
words derived from the Greek, and they were put at the end of the Latin alphabet. 
% Land ¥ were used both as vowels and as consonants (see § 5). 
Nor. —¥ originally denoted the vowel sound u (00), and F stood for the sound of 
our consonant w. When F acquired the value of our f, V came to be used for the 
sound of w as well as for the vowel u. 
Tn this book i is used for both vowel and consonant i, u for vowel u, and 
¥ for consonant u : — itis, vir, juvenis

  2 WORDS AND FORMS [S§ 2-4 
Classification of Sounds 
2. The simple Vowels are a, e, i, 0, u, y. 
The Diphthongs are ae, au, ei, eu, oe, ui, and, in early Latin, ai, 
vi, ou. In the diphthongs both vowel sounds are heard, one fol- 
lowing the other in the same syllable. 
3. Consonants are either voiced (sonant) or voiceless (surd). 
Voiced consonants are pronounced with the same vocal murmur 
that is heard in vowels; voiceless consonants lack this murmur. 
1. The voiced consonants are b, d, g, 1, r, m, n, z, consonant i, v. 
2. The voiceless consonants are p, t, c (k, q), f, h, s, x 
4, Consonants are further classified as in the following table: 
LABIALS DENTALS PALATALS 
Voiced (mediae) b da g 
Mutes ; Voiceless (tenués) p it c (k, q) 
Aspirates ph th ch 
Nasals m n n (before o, g, q) 
Liquids he 
Fricatives (Spirants) 8, % 
Sibilants 8, % 
Semivowels v consonant i 
Double consonants are x (= cs) and z (= dz); h is merely a breathing. 
1. Mutes are pronounced by blocking entirely, for an instant, the passage of the 
breath through the mouth, and then allowing it to escape with an explosion (distinctly 
heard before a following vowel). Between the explosion and the vowel there may be 
a slight puff of breath (h), as in the Aspirates (ph, th, ch).? 
2. Labials are pronounced with the lips, or lips and teeth. 
3. Dentals (sometimes called Linguals) are pronounced with the tip of the tongue 
touching or approaching the upper front teeth. 
4, Palatals are pronounced with a part of the upper surface of the tongue touching 
or approaching the palate.8 
5. Fricatives (or Spirants) are consonants in which the breath passes ey 
through the mouth with audible friction. 
6. Nasals are like voiced mutes, except that the mouth remains closed and the 
breath passes through the nose. 
1 Strictly a Jabio-dental, pronounced with the under lip touching the upper teeth. 
2 The aspirates are almost wholly confined to words borrowed from the Greek. In 
early Latin such borrowed sounds lost their aspiration and became simply p, t, ¢. 
8 Palatals are often classed as (1) velars, pronounced with the tongue touching or ris- 
ing toward the soft palate (in the back part of the mouth), and (2) palatals, in which the 
tongue touches or rises toward the hard palate (farther forward in the mouth). Compare 
the initial consonants in Key and cool, whispering the two words, and it will be observed 
that before e and i the k is sounded farther forward in the mouth than before a, 0, or u.
-P-A-G-E-15
    
§§ 5, 6] ORTHOGRAPHY 2 3 
5. The vowels i and u serve as consonants when pronounced 
rapidly before a vowel so as to stand in the same syllable.! Con- 
sonant i has the sound of English consonant y; consonant u (v) 
that of English consonant w. 
Consonant i and u (v) are sometimes called Semivowels. 
Nore 1.—The Latin alphabet did not distinguish between the vowel and consonant 
sounds of i and u, but used each letter (Iand V) witha double yalue. In modern books 
iand u are often used for the vowel sounds, j and v for the consonant sounds; but in 
printing in capitals J and U are avoided: —IVLIVS (lilius). The characters J and U are 
only slight modifications of the charactersI and V. The ordinary English sounds of 
jand v did not exist in classical Latin, but consonant u perhaps approached English v 
in the pronunciation of some persons. 
Nore 2.—In the combinations qu, gu, and sometimes su, u seems to be the conso- 
nant (w). Thus, aqua, anguis, cOnsuétus (compare English quart, anguish, suave). In 
these combinations, however, u is reckoned neither as a vowel nor as a consonant.? 
ORTHOGRAPHY 
6. Latin spelling varied somewhat with the changes in the 
language and was never absolutely settled in all details. 
Thus, we find lubet, vortd, as earlier, and libet, vertd, as later forms. Other 
variations are optumus and optimus, gerundus and gerendus. 
The spelling of the first century of our era, known chiefly from 
inscriptions, is tolerably uniform, and is commonly used in modern 
editions of the classics. 
a. After v(consonant u),o was anciently used instead of u (voltus, servos), 
and this spelling was not entirely given up until the middle of the first 
century of our era. : 
b. The older quo became cu in the Augustan period; in the second cen- 
tury of our era the spelling quu established itself in some words : — 
cum, older quom ;8 equos, ecus, later equus ; sequontur, secuntur, later sequuntur ; 
similarly exstinguont, exstingunt, later exstinguunt. 
Norr.—In most modern editions the spelling quu is adopted, except in cum. 
c. Between consonant i and a preceding a, e, 0, or u, an i was developed 
as a transient sound, thus producing a diphthong ai, ei, etc., before the con- 
sonant i. In such cases but one i was written: as, aid (for fai-id), maius 
(for tmai-ius), péius (for tpei-ius). 
1 Compare the English word Indian as pronounced in two syllables or in three. 
2 In such words it is possible that the preceding consonant was labialized and that 
no distinct and separate consonant u was heard. 
8 The spelling quum is very late and without authority.

d. Similarly in compounds of iacid but one i was written (as, con-icid, 
not con-iicis); but the usual pronunciation probably showed consonant i 
followed by vowel i (see § 11. e). 
Norr.— Some variations are due to later changes in Latin itself, and these are not 
now recognized in classical texts. 
1. Unaccented ti and ci, when followed by a vowel, came to be pronounced alike ; 
hence niintid was later spel’ed with a ¢ and dicid with a t. 
2. The sound of h was after a time lost and hence this letter was often omitted (as, 
aréna for haréna) or mistakenly written (as, hiimor for dimor). 
8. The diphthong ae early in the time of the Empire acquired the value of long open 
e (about like English e in ¢here), and similarly oe after a time became a long close e 
(about like the English ey in they); and so both were often confused in spelling with 
€: as, coena or caena for the correct form céna. 
Syllables 
7. Every Latin word has as many syllables as it has vowels or 
diphthongs : — 
a-ci-€, mo-n6, fi-li-us, fe-rd-ci-ta-te. 
a. In the division of words into syllables a single consonant (including 
consonant i and v) between two vowels is written and pronounced with 
the following vowel. Doubled consonants are separated : — 
pa-ter, mi-li-tés, in-iii-ri-a, di-vi-d0 ; mit-t6, tol-16. 
Nore 1.—Some extend the rule for single consonants to any consonant group (as 
sp, st, gn) that can begin a word. In this book, dix-it, sax-um, etc. are preferred to 
di-xit, sa-xum; the pronunciation was probably dic-sit, sac-sum. 
Nors 2.— A syllable ending with a vowel or diphthong is called open: all others 
are called close. Thus in pa-ter the first syllable is open, the second close. 
6. In compounds the parts are separated : — 
ab-est, ob-latus, dis-cernd, du-plex, di-std. 
Pronunciation 
8. The so-called Roman Pronunciation of Latin aims to repre- 
sent approximately the pronunciation of classical times. 
VowELs: 4 as in father; & as in idea. 
6 as ch? (prolonged), or a in date; & as eh? (clipped) or e in net. 
ias in machine; { as in holiest or sit. 
6 as in holy; 6 as in obey. 
ii as 00 in boot; & as 00 in foot. 
y between u and i (French u or German ii). 
DieutHones: ae like ay; ei as in eight; oe like oy in boy; 
eu as eh’00; au like ow in now; ui as 00’ee.

  §§ 8-10] PRONUNCIATION AND QUANTITY 5 
Consonants are the same as in English, except that — 
c and g are as in come, get, never as in city, gem. 
8 as in sea, lips, never as in ease. 
Consonant i is like y in young; v (consonant u) like w in wing. 
n in the combinations ns and nf probably indicates nasalization of the 
preceding vowel, which was also lengthened; and final m in an 
unaccented syllable probably had a similar nasalizing effect on 
the preceding vowel. 
ph, th, ch, are properly like p, t, k, followed by h (which may, for con- 
venience, be neglected); but ph probably became like (or nearly 
like) f soon after the classical period, and may be so pronounced 
to distinguish it from p. 
z is as dz in adze. 
bs is like ps; bt is like pt. 
Nors. — Latin is sometimes pronounced with the ordinary English sounds of the 
letters. The English pronunciation should be used in Roman names occurring in 
English (as, Julius Cesar); and in familiar quotations, as, e pluribus unum; viva 
voce; vice versa; a fortiori; veni, vidi, vici, ete. 
Quantity 
9. The Quantity of a Vowel or a Syllable is the time occupied 
in pronouncing it. Two degrees of Quantity are recognized, — 
long and short. 
a. In syllables, quantity is measured from the beginning of the vowel 
or diphthong to the end of the syllable. 
10. Vowels are either long or short by nature, and are pro- 
nounced accordingly (§ 8). 
a. A vowel before another vowel or h is short: as in via, nihil. 
b. A diphthong is long: as in aédés, foédus. So, also, a vowel derived 
from a diphthong: as in excliidd (from fex-clauds). 
ce. A vowel formed by contraction is long: as in nil (from nihil), 
d. A vowel before ns, nf, gn, is long: as in cOnstans, inferd, magnus. 
Norr. — But the quantity of the vowel before gn is not certain in all cases. 
e. A vowel before nd, nt, is regularly short: as in amandus, amant. 
In this book all vowels known to be long are marked (A, 6, etc.), and 
short vowels are left unmarked (a, e, etc.). Vowels marked with both signs 
at once a, é, etc.) occur sometimes as long and sometimes as short. 
Notr. — The Romans sometimes marked vowel length by a stroke above the letter 
(called an apex), as, A; and sometimes the vowel was doubled to indicate length. An 
t made higher than the other letters was occasionally used for i. But none of these 
devices came into general use.

  6 WORDS AND FORMS [g 11 
11. The Quantity of the Syllable is important for the position 
of the accent and in versification. 
a. A syllable containing a long vowel or a diphthong is said to be long 
by nature: as, ma-ter, aes, au-la. 
b. A syllable containing a short vowel followed by two consonants 
(except a mute before 1 or r) or by a double consonant (&, 2) is said to be 
long by position, but the vowel is pronounced short: as, est, ter-ra, sax-um, 
Me-zen-tius. 
Norr.— When a consonant is doubled the pronunciation should show this dis- 
tinctly. Thus in mit-td both t’s should be pronounced as in owt-tadk (not merely a 
single t as in better). 
e. A syllable containing a short vowel followed by a mute before 1 or r 
is properly short, but may be used as long in verse. Such a syllable is said 
to be common. 
Nors 1.—In syllables long by position, but having a short vowel, the length is 
partly due to the first of the consonants, which stands in the same syllable with the 
vowel. In syllables of “common”? quantity (as the first syllable of patrem) the ordi- 
nary pronunciation was pa-trem, but in verse pat-rem was allowed so that the syllable 
could become long. 
Nore 2.—In final syllables ending with a consonant, and containing a short vowel, 
the quantity in verse is determined by the following word: if this begins with a vowel 
the final consonant is joined to it in pronunciation; if it begins with a consonant the 
syllable is long by position. 
Nore 3.—In rules for quantity h is not counted as a consonant, nor is the appar- 
ently consonantal u in qu, gu, su (see § 5. N. 2). 
d. A syllable whose vowel is a, e, 0, or u, followed “by consonant i, is 
long whether the vowel itself is long or short: as, 4-id, ma-ior, pé-ius. 
In such cases the length of the syllable is indicated in this book by a 
circumflex on the vowel. 
Notr.— The length of a syllable before consonant i is due to a transitional sound 
(vowel i) which forms a diphthong with the preceding vowel: as, 4-i6 (for tai-id), 
m4-ior (for tmai-ior). See § 6. c. 
e. In some compounds of iacié (as, in-icid) the consonant i of the simple 
verb was probably pronounced (though not written). Thus the first syl- 
lable was long by position: as, in-icid (for in-iicid). See § 6. d. 
In such cases the length of the syllable is not indicated in this book by 
a circumflex on the vowel. 
f. When a syllable is long by position the quantity of the vowel is not 
always determinable. The vowel should be pronounced short unless it is 
known to be long. 
Nors.— The quantity of a vowel under these circumstances is said to be hidden. 
It is often determined with a greater or less degree of certainty by inscriptional evi- 
dence (see § 10. N.) or by other means. In this book, the quantity of all such vowels 
known to be long is marked.

  §§ 12-14] ACCENT 1 
Accent 
12. Words of two syllables are accented on the first syllable: 
as, R6'ma, fi'dés, tan'go. 
Words of more than two syllables are accented on the Penult 1 
if that is long (as, ami'cus, moné'tur, contin’git); otherwise on the 
Antepenult (as, do'minus, a'licris, dissocia’bilis). 
a. When an enclitic is joined to a word, the accent falls on the syllable 
next before the enclitic, whether long or short: as, d84’que, Amaré’ve, tibine, 
ita’que (and .. . so), as distinguished from itaque (therefore). So (accord- 
ing to some) ex’inde, ec’quands, etc. 
Exceptions: 1. Certain apparent compounds of facid retain the accent of the 
simple verb: as, benefa’cit, calefa’cit (see § 266. a). 
Norx. — These were not true compounds, but phrases. 
2. In thesecond declension the genitive and vocative of nouns in -ius and the 
genitive of those in -ium retain the accent of the nominative : as, Corné/li, Vergi‘li, 
inge’ni (see § 49. c). 
3. Certain words which have lost a final vowel retain the accent of the com- 
plete words: as, illic for illi’ce, prodii’c for prodiice, sati‘n for sati’sne. 
Combinations 
13. In some cases adjacent words, being pronounced together, 
are written as one : — 
Ginusquisque (Gnus quisque), siquis (si quis), quaré (qua ré), quamobrem (quam 
ob rem ; cf. quas ob rés), réspiiblica (rés piblica), iiisiirandum (itis iirandum), 
paterfamilias (pater familias). 
Norx.— Sometimes a slight change in pronunciation resulted, as, especially in the 
old poets, before est in homGst (hom6 est), periculumst (periculum est), ausust (ausus est), 
qualist (qualis est). Similarly there occur vir’, scin’ for visne, scisne, sis (si vis), sddés 
(si audés), siiltis (si vultis). Compare in English somebody, to breakfast; he’s, I’ve, 
thou’rt. i 
Phonetic Changes 
14, Latin, the language of the ancient Romans, was properly, as its name implies, 
the language spoken in the plain of Latium, lying south of the Tiber, which was the first 
territory occupied and governed by the Romans. It is a descendant of an early form 
of speech commonly called Indo-European (by some Indo-Germanic), from which 
are also descended most of the important languages now in use in Europe, including 
among others English, German, the Slavic and the Celtic languages, and further some 
now or formerly spoken in Asia, as Sanskrit, Persian, Armenian. Greek likewise 
1 The Penult is the last syllable but one; the Antepenult, the last but twe.

belongs to the same family. The Romance (or Romanic) languages, of which the 
most important are Italian, French, Provengal, Spanish, Portuguese, and Roumanian, 
are modern descendants of spoken Latin. 
The earliest known forms of Latin are preserved in a few inscriptions. These in- 
crease in number as we approach the time when the language began to be used in litera- 
ture; that is, about B.c. 250. It is the comparatively stable language of the classical 
period (B.c. 80-a.D. 14) that is ordinarily meant when we speak of Latin, and it is 
mainly this that is described in this book. 
15. Among the main features in the changes of Latin from 
the earliest stages of the language as we know it up to the forms 
of classical Latin may be mentioned the following : — 
Vowel Changes 
1. The old diphthong ai became the classical ae (aedilis for old aidilis), 
old oi became oe or ii (finus for old oinos), and old ou became ti (dicd for 
old doucd). 
2. In compound verbs the vowel a of the simple verb often appears as i 
or e, and ae similarly appears as i: — 
faci, factum, but conficis, cdnfectum ; caedd, but occidd, and similarly cecidi, 
perfect of caedd (cf. cad6, occidd ; cecidi, perfect of cadd). 
Norn. —This change is commonly ascribed to an accentuation on the first syl- 
lable, which seems to have been the rule in Latin before the rule given above (see § 12) 
became established. The original Indo-European accent, however, was not limited by 
either of these principles; it was probably a musical accent so-called, consisting in a 
change of pitch, and not merely in a more forcible utterance of the accented syllable. 
8. Two vowels coming together are often contracted : — 
cogo for tco-agd; promo for tpro-emd; nil for nihil; débed for {dé-hibed 
(tdé-habes). 
Consonant Changes 
4, An old s regularly became r between two vowels (rhotacism), passing 
first through the sound of (English) z:— 
eram (cf. est); generis, genitive of genus.1 
Norn. — Final s sometimes became r by analogy: as, honor (older honds), from the 
analogy of hondris, etc. 
5, A dental (t, d) often became s, especially when standing next to t, d, 
or s: as, equestris for tequettris, cdsus for tcadtus (cf. 6, below). 
6. Many instances of assimilation, partial or complete, are found : — 
cessi for tced-si; summus for jsupmus; scriptus for scribtus (b unvoicing to 
p before the voiceless t); and in compound verbs (see § 16). 
1 A similar change can be seen in English: as, were (cf. was), lorn (ef. lose).
-P-A-G-E-21
ER ee OR NG a en een ee er Re ete ee 
§§ 15-17] VOWEL VARIATIONS 9 
Dissimilation, the opposite kind of change, prevented in some cases the 
repetition of the same sound in succcessive syllables : — 
Thus, parilia for palilia (from Palés) ; meridiés for }medidiés; natiralis with suffix 
~Alis (after x), but popularis with -aris (after 1). 
7. Final s was in early Latin not always pronounced: as, plénu(s) fidéi. 
Norz.—Tracesof thispronunciation existed in Cicero’s time. He speaks of theomis- sion of final s before a word beginning with a consonant as “ countrified” (subriisticum). 
8. A final consonant often disappears: as, virgo for tvirgén; lac for 
fiact ; cor for tcord. 
9. G,c, and h unite with a following s'to form x: as, réx for trégs; dux 
for {ducs ; traxi for {trahsi.t 
10. Gand h before t become c: as, réctum for tregtum; actum for tagtum; 
tractum for +trahtum.? 
11. Between m and s or m and t, a p is often developed: as, simpsi for 
fstimsi; émptum for témtum. 
16, Incompounds with prepositions the final consonant in the preposition was often 
assimilated to the following consonant, but usage varied considerably. 
There is good authority for many complete or partial assimilations; as, for ad, 
acc-, agg-, app-, att-, instead of adc-, adg-, etc. Before a labial consonant we find com- 
(comb-, comp-, comm-), but con- is the form before c, d, f, g, cons. i, g, s, t, cons. v; we 
find conl- or coll-, cont- or corr-; cO- in cdnectd, cénived, conitor, cOnibium. In usually 
changes to ifh- before p, b,m. Ob and sub may assimilate b to a following ¢, f, g, or 
Pp; before s and t the pronunciation of prepositions ending in b doubtless had p; surr-, 
summ-, occur for subr-, subm-. The inseparable amb- loses b before a consonant. 
Circum often loses itsm before i. Thes of dis becomes r before a vowel and is assimi- 
lated to a following f; sometimes this prefix appears as di-. Instead of ex we find ef- 
before f (also ecf-). The d of red and séd is generally lost before a consonant. The 
preposition is better left unchanged in most other cases. 
Vowel Variations 
17. The parent language showed great variation in the vowel 
sounds of kindred words.® 
a. This variation is often called by the German name Ablaut. It has 
left considerable traces in the forms of Latin words, appearing sometimes 
as a difference of quantity in the same vowel (as, u, i; e, €), sometimes as a 
difference in the vowel itself (as, e, 0; i, ae) :*— 
tegd, I cover, toga, a robe ; pendd, I weigh, pondus, weight ; fidés, faith, fidus, 
faithful, foedus, a treaty ; miser, wretched, maestus, sad; dare, to give, 
dénum, a gift; rego, I rule, réx, a king; dux, a leader, diicd (for older 
doucd), Tlead. Compare English drive, drove (drave), driven ; bind, bound, 
band ; sing, sang, sung; ete. 
1 Really for ttraghsi. The h of trahd represents an older palatal sound (see § 19). 
2 Really for jtraghtum. These are cases of partial assimilation (cf. 6, above). 
8 This variation was not without regularity, but was confined within definite limits. 
4In Greek, however, it is more extensively preserved.

WORDS AND FORMS [gs 18, 19 
Kindred Forms 
18, Both Latin and English have gone through a series of phonetic changes, dif- 
ferent in the two languages, but following definite laws in each. Hence both pre- 
serve traces of the older speech in some features of the vowel system, and both show 
certain correspondences in consonants in words which each language has inherited from 
the old common stock. Only’a few of these correspondences can be mentioned here. 
19. The most important correspondences in consonants between 
Latin and English, in cognate words, may be seen in the following 
table: —1 Larix ENGLIsH 
p: pater f: father, earlier fader? 
f from bh: ferd, frater b: to bear, brother 
b ‘ | %  lubet, libet v, f: love, lief 
t: ti, tenuis th: thou, thin® 
d: duo, dent- t: two, tooth

qu: quod wh: what

h (from gh): hortus, haedus y, g: yard, goat 
cons. i: iugum y: yoke 
v: ventus, ovis w: wind, ewe 
v from gv: vivus (for tgvivos), 
venid (for +gvemid). } qu, c, k: quick, come 
Nore 1.— Sometimes a consonant lost in Latin is still represented in English: as, 
niv- (for tsniv-), Eng. snow ; anser (for thanser), Eng. goose. 
Nore 2.— From these cases of kindred words in Latin and English must be care- 
fully distinguished those cases in which the Latin word has been taken into English either 
directly or through some one of the modern descendants of Latin, especially French. 
Thus facid is kindred with Eng. do, but from the Latin participle (factum) of this verb 
comes Eng. fact, and from the French descendant (fait) of factum comes Eng. feat. 
1 The Indo-European parent speech had among its consonants voiced aspirates 
(bh, dh, gh). All these suffered change in Latin, the most important results being, 
for bh, Latin f, b (English has b, v, or f); for ah, Latin f, b, d (English has 4); for gh, 
Latin h, g (English has y, g). The other mutes suffered in Latin much less change, 
while in English, as in the other Germanic languages, they have all changed consid- 
erably in accordance with what has been called Grimm’s Law for the shifting of mutes. 
2 The th in father is a late development. The older form fader seems to show an 
exception to the rule that English th corresponds to Latint. The primitive Germanic 
form was doubtless in accordance with this rule, but, on account of the position of the 
accent, which in Germanic was not originally on the first syllable in this word, the 
consonant underwent a secondary change to d. 
8 But to the group st of Latin corresponds also English st; as in Latin std, English 
stand.

§ 20] THE PARTS OF SPEECH 11 
THE PARTS OF SPEECH 
20. Words are divided into eight Parts of Speech: Nouns, 
Adjectives (including Participles), Pronouns, Verbs, Adverbs, 
Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Interjections. 
a. A Noun is the name of a person, place, thing, or idea: as, Caesar; 
Roma, Rome ; domus, a house ; virtiis, virtue. 
Names of particular persons and places are called Proper Nouns; other 
nouns are called Common. 
Norsz.— An Abstract Noun is the name of a quality or idea: as, audacia, boldness ; 
senectiis, oldage. A Collective Noun is the name of a group, class, or the like: as, turba, 
crowd ; exercitus, army. 
6. An Adjective is a word that attributes a quality: as, bonus, good; 
fortis, brave, strong. 
Nore 1.— A Participle isa word that attributes quality like an adjective, but, being 
derived from a verb, retains in some degree the power of the verb to assert: as, — 
Caesar consul creatus, Cesar having been elected consul. 
Norte 2.— Etymologically there is no difference between a noun and an adjective, 
both being formed alike. So, too, all names originally attribute quality, and any com- 
mon name can still be so used. Thus, King William distinguishes this William from 
other Williams, by the attribute of royalty expressed in the name king. 
ec. A Pronoun is a word used to distinguish a person, place, thing, or 
idea without either naming or describing it: as, is, he; qui, who; nds, we. 
Nouns and pronouns are often called Substantives. 
d. A Verb is a word which is capable of asserting something: as, sum, 
I am; amat, he loves. 
Nors.—In all modern speech the verb is usually the only word that asserts any- 
thing, and a verb is therefore supposed to be necessary to complete an assertion. 
Strictly, however, any adjective or noun may, by attributing a quality or giving a 
name, make a complete assertion. In the infancy of language there could haye been 
no other means of asserting, as the verb is of comparatively late development. 
e. An Adverb is a word used to express the time, place, or manner of 
an assertion or attribute: as, splendidé mendax, gloriously false ; hodié natus 
est, he was born to-day. 
Norr.—These same functions are often performed by cases (see §§ 214-217) of 
nouns, pronouns, and adjectives, and by phrases or sentences. In fact, all adverbs 
were originally cases or phrases, but have become specialized by use. 
f. A Preposition is a word which shows the relation between a noun or 
pronoun and some other word or words in the same sentence: as, per agrés 
it, he goes over the fields ; & pliribus inum, one out of many. 
Norxr.— Most prepositions are specialized adverbs (cf. § 219). The relations ex- 
pressed by prepositions were earlier expressed by case-endings.
-P-A-G-E-24
  12 WORDS AND FORMS [ss 20-22 
g- A Conjunction is a word which connects words, or groups of words, 
without affecting their grammatical relations: as, et, and; sed, but. 
Norz.— Some adverbs are also used as connectives. These are called Adverbial 
Conjunctions or Conjunctive (Relative) Adverbs: as, ubi, where; dinec, until. 
h. Interjections are mere exclamations and are not strictly to be classed 
as parts of speech. Thus, —heus, halloo! 6, oh! 
Norx.— Interjections sometimes express an emotion which affects a person or thing 
mentioned, and so have a grammatical connection like other words: as, vae victis, woe 
to the conquered (alas for the conquered)! 
INFLECTION 
21. Latin is an inflected language. 
Inflection is a change made in the form of a word to show its 
grammatical relations. 
a. Inflectional changes sometimes take place in the body of a word, or 
at the beginning, but oftener in its termination : — 
vox, a voice ; vicis, of a voice ; vocd, I call ; vocat, he calls ; vocet, let him call ; 
vocavit, he has called; tangit, he touches; tetigit, he touched. 
b. Terminations of inflection, had originally independent meanings which 
are now obscured. They correspond nearly to the use of prepositions, 
auxiliaries, and personal pronouns in English. 
Thus, in vocat, the termination is equivalent to he or she; in vicis, to the 
preposition of; and in vocet the change of vowel signifies a change of mood. 
c. Inflectional changes in the body of a verb usually denote relations of 
tense or mood, and often correspond to the use of auxiliary verbs in Eng- 
lish : — 
frangit, he breaks or is breaking ; frégit, he broke or has broken; mordet, he 
bites ; momordit, he bit.1 : 
22. The inflection of Nouns, Adjectives, Pronouns, and Par- 
ticiples to denote gender, number, and case is called Declension, 
and these parts of speech are said to be declined. 
The inflection of Verbs to denote voice, mood, tense, number, 
and person is called Conjugation, and the verb is said to be con- 
jugated. 
Norr.— Adjectives are often said to have inflections of comparison. These are, 
however, properly stem-formations made by derivation (p. 55, footnote). 
1 The only proper inflections of verbs are those of the personal endings; and the 
changes here referred to are strictly changes of stem, but have become a part of the 
system of inflections. 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
  $§ 23-25] ROOT, STEM, AND BASE 13 
23. Adverbs, Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Interjections are 
not inflected and are called Particles. 
Norr.— The term Particle is sometimes limited to such words as num, -ne, an (inter- 
rogative), ndu, n& (negative), si (conditional), etc., which are used simply to indicate 
the form or construction of a sentence. 
Root, Stem, and Base 
24, The ats of a word, to which the terminations are attached, 
is called the Stem. 
The Stem contains the idea of the word without relations; but, except 
in the first part of a compound (as, arti-fex, artificer), it cannot ordinarily be 
used without some termination to express them.1 
Thus the stem vic- denotes voice ; with -s added it becomes vox, a voice or the 
voice, as the subject or agent of an action ; with -is it becomes vicis, and signifies 
of a voice. 
Nors.— The stem is in many forms so united with the termination that a compari- 
son with other forms is necessary to determine it. 
25. A Root is the simplest form attainable by analysis of a 
word into its component parts. 
Such a form contains the main idea of the word in a very general sense, 
and is common also to other words either in the same language or in kin- 
dred languages.? 
Thus the root of the stem vic- is voc, which does not mean to call, or I call, 
or calling, but merely expresses vaguely the idea of calling, and cannot be used 
as a part of speech without terminations. With a-it becomes voca-, the stem of 
vocare (to call) ; with ay- it is the stem of vocavit (he called) ; with ato- it becomes 
the stem of vocatus (called) ; with atidn- it becomes the stem of vocatidnis (of a 
calling). With its vowel lengthened it becomes the stem of vox, voc-is (a voice: 
that by which we call). This stem viéc-, with -alis added, means belonging to a 
voice; with -iila, a little voice. 
Notz.—In inflected languages, words are built up from Roots, which at a very 
early time were used alone to express ideas, as is now done in Chinese. Roots are 
modified into Stems, which, by inflection, become fully formed words. The process by 
which roots are modified, in the various forms of derivatives and compounds, is called 
Stem-building. The whole of this process is originally one of composition, by which 
significant endings are added one after another to forms capable of pronunciation and 
conveying a meaning. 
Roots had long ceased to be recognized as such before the Latin existed as a sepa- 
rate language. Consequently the forms which we assume as Latin roots never really 
existed in Latin, but are the representatives of forms used earlier. 
1 Another exception is the imperative second person singular in -e (as, rege). 
2 For example, the root sta is found in the Sanskrit tishthami, Greek tornu, Latin 
sistere and stare, German ftejen, and English stand.

  14 WORDS AND FORMS [$§ 26-80 
26. The Stem may be thesame as the root: as induc-is, of a leader, 
fer-t, he bears; but it is more frequently formed from the root— 
As By changing or lengthening its vowel: as in scob-s, sawdust (SCAB, 
shave); rég-is, of a king (REG, direct); voc-is, ofa voice (voc, call). 
2. By the addition of a simple suffix (originally another root): as in fuga-, 
stem of fuga, flight (ruG + 2-); regi-s, you rule (REG + stem-ending ¥,-); 
sini-t, he allows (st + n°%/,-).1 
3. By two or more of these methods: as in diicit, he leads (Duc + stem- 
ending ¥,-). 
4, By derivation and composition, following the laws of development 
peculiar to the language. (See §§ 227 ff.) 
, 2% The Base is that part of a word which is unchanged in 
inflection: as, serv- in servus; méns- in ménsa; ign- in ignis. 
a. The Base and the Stem are often identical, as in many consonant 
stems of nouns (as, rég- in rég-is). If, however, the stem ends in a vowel, 
the latter does not appear in the base, but is variously combined with the 
inflectional termination. Thus the stem of servus is servo-; that of ménsa, 
méns4-; that of ignis, igni-. 
28. Inflectional terminations are variously modified by com- 
bination with the final vowel or consonant of the Stem, and thus 
the various forms of Declension and Conjugation (see §§ 36, 164) 
developed. 
GENDER 
29. The Genders distinguished in Latin are three: Masculine, 
Feminine, and Neuter. 
30. The gender of Latin nouns is either natwral or grammatical. 
a. Natural Gender is distinction as to the sex of the object denoted: as, 
puer (M.), boy; puella (F.), girl; réx (am.), king; régina (F.), queen. 
Norg 1.—Many nouns have both a masculine and a feminine form to distinguish 
SeX: as, Cervus, cerva, stag, doe; cli€us, clienta, client; victor, victrix, conqueror. 
Many designations of persons (as nauta, sailor) usually though not necessarily male 
are always treated as masculine. - Similarly names of tribes and peoples are masculine: 
as, Romani, the Romans; Persae, the Persians. 
Nore 2.—A few neuter nouns are used to designate persons as belonging to a class: 
as, mancipium tuum, your slave (your chattel). 
Many pet names of girls and boys are neuter in form: as, Paegnium, Glycerium, 
Nors 3.— Names of classes or collections of persons may be of any gender: as, 
exercitus (m.), aciés (F.), and agmen (N.), army; operae (F. plur.), workmen; cOpiae 
@. plur.), troops; sendtus (a.), senate; cohors (#.), cohort; concilium (N.), council. 
1 These suffixes are Indo-European stem-endings.
-P-A-G-E-27
  §§ 30-34] GENERAL RULES OF GENDER 15 
b. Grammatical Gender is a formal distinction as to sex where no actual 
sex exists in the object. It is shown by the form of the adjective joined 
with the noun: as, lapis magnus (M.), a great stone; manus mea (F.), my 
hand. 
General Rules of Gender 
31. Names of Male beings, and of Rivers, Winds, Months, and 
Mountains, are masculine: — 
pater, father ; Iilius, Julius; Tiberis, the Tiber; auster, south wind; Ianua- 
rius, January ; Apenninus, the Apennines. 
Norr.— Names of Months are properly adjectives, the masculine noun ménsis, 
month, being understood: as, Ianuarius, January. 
a. A few names of Rivers ending in-a (as, Allia), with the Greek names 
Léthé and Styx, are feminine; others are variable or uncertain. 
b. Some names of Mountains are feminine or neuter, taking the gender 
of their termination: as, Alpés (F.), the Alps; Soracte (N.). 
32. Names of Female beings, of Cities, Countries, Plants, Trees, 
and Gems, of many Animals (especially Birds), and of most ab- 
stract Qualities, are feminine : — 
mater, mother ; Tilia, Julia; Roma, Rome; Italia, Italy; rosa, rose; pinus, 
pine; sapphirus, sapphire; anas, duck; véritas, truth. 
a. Some names of Towns and Countries are masculine: as, Sulm6, Gabii 
(plur.) ; or neuter, as, Tarentum, Illyricum. 
b. A few names of Plants and Gems follow the gender of their termina- 
tion: as, centauréum (N.), centaury; acanthus (M.), bearsfoot ; opalus (M.), 
opal. 
Norr.— The gender of most of the above may also be recognized by the termina- 
tions, according to the rules given under the several declensions. The names of Roman 
women were usually feminine adjectives denoting their géns or house (see § 108. b). 
33. Indeclinable nouns, infinitives, terms or phrases used as 
nouns, and words quoted merely for their form, are neuter : — 
fas, right; nihil, nothing; gummi, gum; scire tuum, your knowledge (to 
know) ; triste valé, a sad farewell ; hic ipsum did, this very ‘ long.” 
34, Many nouns may be either masculine or feminine, accord- 
ing to the sex of the object. These are said to be of Common 
Gender: as, exsul, exile; bis, ov or cow; paréns, parent. 
Norts.— Several names of animals have a grammatical gender, independent of sex. 
These are called epicene. Thus lepus, hare, is always masculine, and vulpés, fox, is 
always feminine.

  16 DECLENSION OF NOUNS [$§ 85-37 
NUMBER AND CASE 
35. Nouns, Pronouns, Adjectives, and Participles are declined 
in two Numbers, singular and plural; and in six Cases, nomina- 
tive, genitive, dative, accusative, ablative, vocative. 
a. The Nominative is the case of the Subject of a sentence. 
b. The Genitive may generally be translated by the English Possessive, 
or by the Objective with the preposition of. 
ce. The Dative is the case of the Indirect Object (§ 274). It may usually 
be translated by the Objective with the preposition to or for. 
d. The Accusative is the case of the Direct Object of a verb (§ 274). It 
is used also with many of the prepositions. 
e. The Ablative may usually be translated by the Objective with from, 
by, with, in, or at. It is often used with prepositions, 
f. The Vocative is the case of Direct Address. 
g- All the cases, except the nominative and vocatiye, are used as object- 
cases; and are sometimes called Oblique Cases (casas obliqu?). 
h. In names of towns and a few other words appear traces of another 
case (the Locative), denoting the place where: as, Rdmae, at Rome ; riri, in 
the country. 
Norz.— Still another case, the Instrumental, appears in a few adverbs (§ 215. 4). 
DECLENSION OF NOUNS 
86, Declension is produced by adding terminations originally significant to differ- 
ent forms of stems, vowel or consonant. The various phonetic corruptions in the lan- 
guage have given rise to the several declensions. Most of the case-endings, as given 
in Latin, contain also the final letter of the stem. 
Adjectives are, in general, declined like nouns, and are etymologically to be classed 
with them; but they have several peculiarities of inflection (see § 109 ff.). 
37. Nouns are inflected in five Declensions, distinguished by 
the final letter (characteristic) of the Stem, and by the case-ending 
of the Genitive Singular. 
Dect. 1 Cuaractenistic & Gen. Siva. ae 
2 5 44 
3 i or a Consonant is 
4 a iis 
5 é ei 
a. The Stem of a noun may be found, if a consonant stem, by omitting 
the case-ending ; if a vowel stem, by substituting for the case-ending the 
characteristic vowel.
-P-A-G-E-29
  §§ 38, 89] CASE-ENDINGS OF THE FIVE DECLENSIONS 17 
38. The following are General Rules of Declension:   
a. The Vocative is always the same as the Nominative, except in the 
singular of nouns and adjectives in -us of the second declension, which have 
-e in the vocative. It is not included in the paradigms, unless it differs 
from the nominative. 
6. In neuters the Nominative and Accusative are always alike, and in 
the plural end in -&. 
c. The Accusative singular of all masculines and feminines ends in -m; 
the Accusative plural in -s. 
d. In the last three declensions (and in a few cases in the others) the 
Dative singular ends in -i. 
%. The Dative and Ablative plural are always alike. 
f. The Genitive plural always ends in -um. 
g- Final -i, -o, -u of inflection are always long ; final -a is short, except in 
the Ablative singular of the first declension ; final -e is long in the first and 
fifth declensions, short in the second and third. Final -is and -us are long in 
plural cases.

Nominative ending is -a (the stem-vowel shortened), except in 
Greek nouns.

Ast.  stellis ‘ with, from, by, ete. stars -is 
a. The Latin has no article; hence stella may mean a star, the star, or 
simply star. 
Gender in the First Declension 
42. Nouns of the first declension are Feminine. 
Exceptions : Nouns masculine from their signification : as, nauta, sailor. Soa 
few family or personal names: as, Miréna, Dolabella, Scaevola!; also, Hadria, the 
Adriatic. 
Case-Forms in the First Declension 
43. a. The genitive singular anciently ended in -ai (dissyllabic), which 
is occasionally found: as, aulai. The same ending sometimes occurs in the 
dative, but only as a diphthong. 
1 Scaevola is really a feminine adjective, used as a noun, meaning little left hand; 
but, being used as the name of a man (originally a nickname), it became masculine. 
Original genders are often thus changed by a change in the sense of a noun. 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  §§ 43, 44] FIRST DECLENSION (4-STEMS) 19 
6. An old genitive in -ds is preserved in the word familias, often used in 
the combinations pater (miter, filius, filia) familias, father, etc., of a family 
(plur. patrés familias or familiarum). 
c. The Locative form for the singular ends in -ae; for the plural in -is (cf. 
p. 34, footnote): as, Rémae, at Rome; Athénis, at Athens. 
d. The genitive plural is sometimes found in -um instead of -drum, espe- 
cially in Greek patronymics, as, Aeneadum, sons of 4neas, and in compounds 
with -cla and -géna, signifying dwelling and descent: as, caelicolum, celes- 
tials ; Troiugenum, sons of Troy; so also in the Greek nouns amphora and 
drachma. 
e. The dative and ablative plural of dea, goddess, filia, daughter, end in 
an older form -abus (dedbus, filidbus) to distinguish them from the corre- 
sponding cases of deus, god, and filius, son (deis, filiis). So rarely with other 
words, as, liberta, freed-woman; mitla, she-mule; equa, mare. But, except 
when the two sexes are mentioned together (as in formulas, documents, 
etc.), the form in -is is preferred in all but dea and filia. 
Nore 1.—The old ending of the ablative singular (-4d) is sometimes retained in 
early Latin: as, praidid, booty (later, praeda). 
Norr 2.—In the dative and ablative plural -eis for -is is sometimes found, and -iis 
(as in taeniis) is occasionally contracted to -is (taenis) ; so regularly in words in -Aia (as, 
Bais from Baiae). 
Greek Nouns of the First Declension 
44, Many nouns of the First Declension borrowed from the 
Greek are entirely Latinized (as, aula, court); but others retain 
traces of their Greek case-forms in the singular.

There are (besides proper names) about thirty-five of these words, several being 
names of plants or arts: as, crambé, cabbage; miisicé, music. Most have also regular 
Latin forms: as, cométa; but the nominative sometimes has the a long. 
a. Greek forms are found only in the singular; the plural, when it 
oceurs, is regular: as, cométae, -drum, etc. 
6. Many Greek nouns vary between the first, the second, and the third 
declensions : as, Bodtae (genitive of Bodtés, -is), Thicydidas (accusative plu- 
ral of Thiicydidés, -is). See § 52. a and § 81. 
Nors.— The Greek accusative Scipiadam, from Scipiadés, descendant of the Scipios, 
is found in Horace. 
SECOND DECLENSION (o-STEMS) 
45. The Stem of nouns of the Second Declension ends in ¥-: 
as, viro- (stem of vir, man), servo- (stem of servus or servos, slave), 
bello- (stem of bellum, war). 
a. The Nominative is formed from the stem by adding s in masculines 
and feminines, and m in neuters, the vowel 6 being weakened to ti (see 
§§ 6. a, 46. n.4). 
b. In most nouns whose stem ends in r8- the s is not added in the Nomi- 
native, but o is lost, and e intrudes before r,! if not ely, present: as, 
ager, stem agr¥-; cf. puer, stem puero-. 
Exceptions : erus, hesperus, ifiniperus, morus, numerus, taurus, umerus, uterus, 
virus, and many Greek nouns. 
ce. The stem-vowel 8 has a variant form @,° which is preserved in the 
Latin vocative singular of nouns in -us: as, servé, vocative of servus, slave. 
Notr.—In composition this appearsasi. Thus, —belli-ger, warlike (from bello/.-, 
stem of bellum, war).

Gender in the Second Declension 
48. Nouns ending in -us (-0s), -er, -ir, are Masculine ; those end- 
ing in -um (-on) are Neuter. 
Exceptions: Names of countries and towns in -us (-os) are Feminine: as, 
Aegyptus, Corinthus. Also many names of plants and gems, with the following: 
alvus, belly ; carbasus, linen (pl. carbasa, sails, N.) ; colus, distaff; humus, ground; 
vannus, winnowing-shovel. 
Many Greek nouns retain their original gender : as, arctus (¥.), the Polar Bear ; 
methodus (r.), method. 
a. The following in -us are Neuter ; their accusative (as with all neuters) 
is the same as the nominative: pelagus, sea; virus, poison; vulgus (rarely 
M.), the crowd. They are not found in the plural, except pelagus, which has 
a rare nominative and accusative plural pelagé. 
Norr.— The nominative plural neuter cété, sea monsters, occurs; the nominative 
singular cétus occurs in Vitruvius. 
Case-Forms in the Second, Declension 
49. a. The Locative form of this declension ends for the singular in i: 
as, humi, on the ground; Corinthi, at Corinth; for the plural, in -is: as, 
Philippis, at Philippi (cf. p. 34, footnote). 
b. The genitive of nouns in -ius or -ium ended, until the Augustan Age, 
in a single -i: as, fili, of a son; Pompéi, of Pompey (Pompéius); but the 
accent of the nominative is retained: as, ingé’ni, of genius.t 
c. Proper names in -ius have -i in the vocative, retaining the accent of 
the nominative: as, Vergi‘li. So also, filius, son ; genius, divine guardian: as, 
audi, mi fili, hear, my son. 
Adjectives in -ius form the vocative in -ie, and some of these are occa- 
sionally used as nouns: as, Lacedaemonie, O Spartan. 
Norte. — Greek names in -ius have the yocative -ie: as, Lyrcius, yocative Lyrcie. 
d. The genitive plural often has -um or (after vy) -om (cf. § 6. a) instead 
of drum, especially in the poets: as, deum, superum, divom, of the gods; 
virum, of men. Also in compounds of vir, and in many words of money, 
measure, and weight: as, Sévirum, of the Seviri ; nummum, of coins ; iigerum, 
of acres. 
e. The original ending of the ablative singular (-6d) is sometimes found 
in early Latin: as, Gnaivéd (later, Gnaed), Cneius. 
f. Proper names in -Aius, -éius, -dius (as, Aurunculéius, B6i), are declined 
like Pompéius.

Summary of 7-Stems 
73, The i-declension was confused even to the Romans themselves, nor was it stable 
at all periods of the language, early Latin having i-forms which afterwards disap- 
peared. There was a tendency in nouns to lose the i-forms, in adjectives to gain them. 
The nominative plural (-is) § was most thoroughly lost, next the accusative singular 
(im), next the ablative (-i); while the genitive and accusative plural (ium, -is) were 
retained in almost all. 
74, I-stems show the i of the stem in the following forms: — 
a. They have the genitive plural in -ium (but some monosyllables lack 
it entirely). For a few exceptions, see {78. 
b. All neuters have the nominative and accusative plural in -ia. 
c. The accusative plural (m. or Fr.) is regularly -is, 
d. The accusative singular (m. or ¥.) of a few ends in -im,(§ 75). 
e. The ablative singular of all neuters, and of many masculines and 
feminines, ends in -i (see § 76). 
75. The regular case-ending of the Accusative singular of i- 
stems (M. or F.) would be -im: as, sitis, sitim (cf. stella, -am ; servus, 
-um); but in most nouns this is changed to -em (following the 
consonant declension). 
1 Rarely clientum. 2 Also actatium. Cf. § 71. 4. 
8 An old, though not the original, ending (see p. 32, footnote 2).
-P-A-G-E-44
  Se DECLENSION OF NOUNS [gs 75-78 
a. The accusative in -im is found exclusively — 
1. In Greek nouns and in names of rivers. 
2. In biris, cucumis, ravis, sitis, tussis, vis. 
8. In adverbs in -tim (being accusative of nouns in -tis), as, partim; and in 
amussim. 
b. The accusative in -im is found sometimes in febris, puppis, restis, 
turris, seciiris, sémentis, and rarely in many other words. 
76. The regular form of the Ablative singular of i-stems would 
be -i: as, sitis, siti; but in most nouns this is changed to -e. 
a. The ablative in -1 is found exclusively — 
1. In nouns having the accusative in -im (§ 75) ; also secaris. 
2. In the following adjectives used as nouns: aequ4lis, anndlis, aqualis, con- 
sularis, gentilis, molaris, primipilaris, tribilis. 
8. In neuters in -e, -al, -ar: except baccar, iubar, réte, and sometimes mare. 
®. The ablative in -i is found sometimes — 
1. In avis, clavis, febris, finis, ignis,! imber, lix, navis, ovis, pelvis, puppis, 
sémentis, strigilis, turris, and occasionally in other words. 
2. In the following adjectives used as nouns: affinis, bipennis, canalis, famili- 
Aris, natalis, rivalis, sapiéns, tridéns, trirémis, vécalis. 
Nore 1.—The ablative of famés is always famé (§ 105. ¢). The defective mane has 
sometimes mani (§ 103. 6. N.) as ablative. 
Nore 2.— Most names of towns in - (as, Praeneste, Tergeste) and Soracte, a moun- 
jain, have the ablative in -e. Caere has Caeréte. 
Norr 3.— Canis and iuvenis have cane, iuvene. 
77. The regular Nominative plural of istems is -és,? but -is is 
oceasionally found. The regular Accusative plural -is is common, 
but not exclusively used in any word. An old form for both 
cases is -€is (diphthong). 
78. The following have -um (not -ium) in the genitive plural: 
1. Always, — canis, iuvenis,® ambagés, mare (once only, otherwise want- 
ing), volucris; regularly, sédés, vatés. 
2. Sometimes, — apis, caedés, cladés, ménsis, strués, subolés. 
3. Very rarely, —patrials in -ds, -atis; -is, -itis; as, Arpinds, Arpinatum ; 
Samnis, Samnitum. 
1 Always in the formula aqua et igni interdici (§ 401). 
2 The Indo-European ending of the nominative plural, -és (preserved in Greek in 
consonant stems, as dptvé, Sprvy-es), contracts with a stem-vowel and gives -és in the 
Latin i-declension (cf. the Greek plural des). This -és was extended to consonant 
stems in Latin. : 8 Canis and iuvenis are really n-stems.

34 DECLENSION OF NOUNS Sy 79-81 
a. Two vowel-stems in i-, gri- and si-, which follow the third declension, 
add s in the nominative, and are inflected like mute stems: gris has also 
a nominative gruis; stis has both suibus and siibus in the dative and ablative 
plural, griis has only gruibus. 
6b. In the stem bovy- (bou-) the diphthong ou becomes 6 in the nominative 
(bs, bbvis). 3 
In nay- (nau-) an i is added (nfvis, -is), and it is declined like turris (§ 67). 
In IBy- (= Zevs) the diphthong (ou) becomes i in Ii-piter (for -pater), 
genitive Ivis, etc.; but the form Iuppiter is preferred. 
c. In iter, itineris (w.), iecur, iecinoris (iecoris) (N.), supelléx, supelléctilis 
(£.), the nominative has been formed from a shorter stem; in senex, senis, 
from a longer ; so that these words show a combination of forms from two 
distinct stems. 
d. In nix, nivis the nominative retains a g from the original stem, the g 
uniting with s, the nominative ending, to form x. In the other cases the 
stem assumes the form niv- and it adds i in the genitive plural. 
e. Vas (N.), vasis, keeps s throughout; plural vasa, vasorum. A dative 
plural vasibus also occurs. There is a rare singular yvasum. . 
The Locative Case 
80. The Locative form for nouns of the third declension ends 
in the singular in -i or -e, in the plural in -ibus: as, rari, in the 
country ; Carthagini or Carthagine, at Carthage; Trallibus, at Tralles.1 
  Greek Nouns of the Third Declension 
81. Many nouns originally Greek — mostly proper names — 
retain Greek forms of inflection. So especially — 
1. Genitive singular in -os, as, tigridos. 
2. Accusative singular in -a, as, aethera. 
3. Vocative singular like the stem, as, Periclé, Orpheu, Atla. 
4. Nominative plural in -és, as, hérdés. 
5. Accusative plural in -&s, as, hérdas. 
1 The Indo-European locative singular ended in-i, which became -€ in Latin. Thus 
the Latin ablative in -e is, historically considered, a locative. The Latin ablative in 
-i (from -id) was an analogical formation (cf. -4 from -ad, -6 from -6d), properly belong- 
ing to i-stems. With names of towns and a few other words, a locative function was 
ascribed to forms in -i (as, Carthagini), partly on the analogy of the real locative of 
o-stems (as, Corinthi, § 49. a); but forms in -€ also survived in this use. The plural 
-bus is properly dative or ablative, but in forms like Trallibus it has a locative func- 
tion. Cf. Philippis (§ 49. a), in which the ending -is is, historically considered, either 
locative, or instrumental, or both, and Athénis (§ 43. ¢), in which the ending is formed 
on the analogy of o-stems.

d. Stems in ont- form the nominative in -dn: as, horizdn, Xenophin; 
but a few are occasionally Latinized into 6n- (nom. -0): as, Draco, -dnis; 
Antiph6, -dnis. 
e. Like Simois are declined stems in ant-, ent-, and a few in int- (nomi- 
native in -As, -is, -fis): as, Atlas, -antis; Trapeziis, -intis. 
f. Some words fluctuate between different declensions: as Orpheus be- 
tween the second and the third. 
g- -0n is found in the genitive plural in a few Greek titles of books: as, 
Metamorphisedn, of the Metamorphoses (Ovid’s well-known poem); Gedrgicon, 
of the Georgics (a poem of Virgil). 
Gender in the Third Declension 
  84, The Gender of nouns of this declension must be learned 
by practice and from the Lexicon. Many are masculine or femi- 
nine by nature or in accordance with the general rules for gen- 
der (p.15). The most important rules for the others, with their 
principal exceptions, are the following: —? 
85. Masculine are nouns in -or, -ds, -er, -és (gen. -itis), -ex (gen. 
-icis): as, color, flds, imber, gurges (gurgitis), vertex (verticis). 
Exceptions are the following : — 
a. Feminine are arbor; cés, dds; linter. 
6. Neuter are ador, aequor, cor, marmor; ds (Gris); also os (ossis) ; 
cadaver, iter, tiiber, iber, vér; and names of plants and trees in -er: as, 
acer, papaver. 
86. Feminine are nouns in-d, -4s, -&s, -is, -is, -x, and in -s preceded 
by a consonant: as, legid, civitas, nitbés, avis, virtiis, arx, urbs. The 
nouns in -d are mostly those in -d6 and -gé, and abstract and collec- 
tive nouns in -i6. 
Exceptions are the following: — 
a. Masculine are led, lednis; ligd, dnis ; serm6, -dnis; also cardé, harpago, 
margo, drd6, turbid ; and concrete nouns in -id: as, pugid, tinid, papilid ; 2 
acinacés, ariés, celés, lebés, pariés, pés ; 
1 Some nouns of doubtful or variable gender are omitted. 
2 Many nouns in -6 (gen. -Onis) are masculine by signification: as, gerd, carrier ; 
restid, ropemaker; and family names (originally nicknames): as, Cicerd, Nasé. See 
§§ 236. c, 255.
-P-A-G-E-49
    §§ 86-89] FOURTH DECLENSION 37 
Nouns in -nis and -guis : as, ignis, sanguis ; also axis, caulis, collis, cucumis, 
énsis, fascis, follis, fistis, lapis, ménsis, orbis, piscis, postis, pulvis, vomis ; 
miis; 
calix, fornix, grex, phoenix, and nouns in -ex (gen. -icis) (§ 85); 
déns, fons, mons, pons. 
Norr.—Some nouns in -is and -ns which are masculine were originally adjectives 
or participles agreeing with a masculine noun: as, Aprilis (sc. ménsis), M., April; 
oriéns (sc. s0l), M., the east; annalis (sc. liber), m., the year-book. 
6. Neuter are vas (vasis); criis, its, piis, ris, tis. 
87. Neuter are nouns in -a, -e, -1, -n, -ar, -ur, -tis: as, poéma, mare, 
animal, ndmen, calcar, rdbur, corpus; also Jac and caput. 
Exceptions are the following : — 
a. Masculine are sal, s0l, pecten, vultur, lepus. 
6. Feminine is pecus (gen. -udis). 
FOURTH DECLENSION 
88. The Stem of nouns of the Fourth Declension ends in u- 
This is usually weakened to i before -bus. Masculine and Femi- 
nine nouns form the nominative by adding s; Neuters have for 
nominative the simple stem, but with a (long). 
89. Nouns of the Fourth Declension are declined as follows :

Gender in the Fourth Declension 
90. Most nouns of the Fourth Declension in -us are Masculine. 
Exceptions: The following are Feminine : acus, anus, colus, domus, idiis (plural), 
manus, nurus, porticus, quinquatriis (plural), socrus, tribus, with a few names of 
plants and trees. Also, rarely, penus, specus. 
91. The only Neuters of the Fourth Declension are corni, genii, 
pecii (§ 105. f), verii.? 
Case-Forms in the Fourth Deciension 
92. The following peculiarities in case-forms of the Fourth 
Declension require notice : — 
a. A genitive singular in -i (as of the second declension) sometimes 
occurs in nouns in -tus: as, senatus, genitive senati (regularly senatiis). 
b. In the genitive plural -uum is sometimes pronounced as one sylla- 
ble, and may then be written -um: as, currum (Aen. vi. 653) for curruum. 
ec. The dative and ablative plural in -itbus are retained in partus and 
tribus; so regularly in artus and lacus, and occasionally in other words; 
portus and specus have both -ubus and -ibus. 
d. Most names of plants and trees, and colus, distaff, have also forms of 
the second declension: as, ficus, fig, genitive ficiis or fici. 
e. An old genitive singular in -uis or -uos and an old genitive plural in 
-uom occur rarely: as, senadtuis, senatuos; fluctuom. 
f. The ablative singular ended anciently in -id (cf. § 43. N. 1): as, 
magistratid. 
93. Domus (F.), house, has two stems ending in u- and o-. Hence 
it shows forms of both the fourth and second declensions :

Nom. domus domiis 
Gen. domiis (domi, loc.) domuum (domérum) 
Dar. domui (domé) domibus 
Aco. domum domés (domiis)

Nors 1. — The Locative is domi (rarely domui), at home. 
Nore 2.— The Genitive domi occurs in Plautus; domérum is late or poetic. 
1 A few other neuters of this declension are mentioned by the ancient grammarians 
as occurring in certain cases.
-P-A-G-E-51
§§ 94-96] FIFTH DECLENSION (#-STEMS) 389 
94. Most nouns of the Fourth Declension are formed from 
verb-stems, or roots, by means of the suffix -tus (-sus) (§ 238. 6): 
cantus, song, CAN, cand, sing; casus (for jcad-tus), chance, cap, cado, fall ; 
exsulatus, exile, from exsuld, to be an exile (exsul). 
a. Many are formed either from verb-stems not in use, or by analogy: 
consulatus (as if from tcdnsuld, -are), sendtus, incestus. 
6. The accusative and the dative or ablative of nouns in -tus (-sus) form 
the Supines of verbs (§ 159. b): as, spectatum, petitum ; dicti, visi. 
ec. Of many verbal derivatives only the ablative is used as a noun: as, 
iussii (med), by (my) command ; so iniussi (popull), without (the people’s) order. 
Of some only the dative is used: as, divisui. 
FIFTH DECLENSION (é-STEMS) 
95. The Stem of nouns of the Fifth Declension ends in é-, which 
appears in all the cases. The Nominative is formed from the stem 
by adding s.

  40 DECLENSION OF NOUNS [$$ 97-99 
Gender in the Fifth Declension 
-97, All nouns of the Fifth Declension are Feminine, except 
diés (usually M.), day, and meridiés (M.), noon. 
a. Diés is sometimes feminine in the singular, especially in phrases indi- 
cating a fixed time, and regularly feminine when used of time in general: 
as, cOnstitita dié, on a set day; longa diés, a long time. 
Case-Forms in the Fifth Declension 
98. The following peculiarities require notice : — 
a. Of nouns of the fifth declension, only diés and rés are declined through- 
out. Most want the plural, which is, however, found in the nominative or 
accusative in aciés, effigiés, Gluviés, faciés, glaciés, seriés, speciés, spés.1 
6. The Locative form of this declension ends in -é. It is found only in 
certain adverbs and expressions of time: — 
hodié, to-day ; dis quartd (old, quarti), the fourth day ; 
perendié, day after to-morrow ; pridié, the day before. 
c. The fifth declension is closely related to the first, and several nouns 
have forms of both: as, materia, -iés; saevitia,-iés. The genitive and dative 
in -@ are rarely found in these words. 
d. Some nouns vary between the fifth and the third declension: as, 
requiés, satiés (also satids, genitive -Atis), plébés (also plébs, genitive plébis), 
famés, genitive famis, ablative famé. 
Norr.—In the genitive and dative -€i (-€1) was sometimes contracted into -&: 
as, tribiinus plébéi, tribune of the people (plébés). Genitives in -i and -8 also occur: 
as, dil (Aen. i. 636), plébi-scitum, acié (B. G. ii. 23). A few examples of the old geni- 
tive in -és are found (cf. -s in the first declension, § 43. 6). The dative has rarely -é, 
and a form in -i is cited. 
DEFECTIVE NOUNS 
Nouns wanting in the Plural 
99. Some nouns are ordinarily found in the Singular number 
only (singuldria tantum). -These are — 
1. Most proper names: as, Caesar, Caesar; Gallia, Gaul. 
2. Names of things not counted, but reckoned in mass: as, aurum, gold ; 
aér, air; triticum, wheat. 
8. Abstract nouns: as, ambitid, ambition; fortitidd, cowrage; calor, heat. 
1 The forms faciérum, speciérum, speciébus, spérum, spébus, are cited by grammarians, 
also spérés, spéribus, and some of these occur in late authors.
-P-A-G-E-53
§§ 100-102] DEFECTIVE NOUNS 41 
100. Many of these nouns, however, are used in the plural in 
some other sense. 
a. The plural of a proper name may be applied to two or more persons 
or places, or even things, and so become strictly common : — 
duodecim Caesarés, the twelve Cesars. 
Galliae, the two Gauls (Cis- and ‘Lransalpine). 
Castores, Castor and Pollux ; lovés, images of Jupiter. 
6. The plural of names of things reckoned in mass may denote particular 
objects: as, aera, bronze utensils, nivés, snowflakes ; or different kinds of a thing: 
as, derés, airs (good and bad). 
¢. The plural of abstract nouns denotes occasions or instances of the quality, 
or the like: — 
quaedam excellentiae, some cases of superiority ; dtia, periods of rest ; calérés, 
frigora, times of heat and cold. 
Nouns wanting in the Singular 
.101. Some nouns are commonly or exclusively found in the 
Plural (plirdlia tantum). Such are — 
“1. Many names of towns: as, Athénae (Athens), Thirii, Philippi, Véii. 
2. Names of festivals and games: as, Olympia, the Olympic Games; Baccha- 
nilia, feast of Bacchus; Quinquatriis, festival of Minerva; 1idi Romani, the 
Roman Games. 
8. Names of classes: as, optimatés, the upper classes; maidrés, ancestors ; 
liberi, children; penatés, household gods; Quirités, citizens (of Rome). 
4. Words plural by signification: as, arma, weapons; artiis, joints; divi- 
tiae, riches; scdlae, stairs; valvae, folding-doors ; forés, double-doors ; angustiae, 
@ narrow pass (narrows); moenia, city walls. 
Norr 1.— Some words, plural by signification in Latin, are translated by English 
nouns in the singular number: as, déliciae, delight, darling; faucés, throat; fidés, lyre 
(also singular in poetry) ; insidiae, ambush; cervicés, neck ; viscera, flesh. 
Nor 2.— The poets often use the plural number for the singular, sometimes for 
metrical reasons, sometimes from a mere fashion: as, dra (for 6s), the face; scéptra (for 
seéptrum), sceptre; silentia (for silentium), silence. 
102. Some nouns of the above classes (§ 101. 1-4), have a corre- 
sponding singular, as noun or adjective, often in a special sense: 
1. As noun, to denote a single object: as, Bacchanal, a spot sacred to 
Bacchus; optimas, an aristocrat. 
2. As adjective: as, Cato Maior, Cato the Elder. 
3. In a sense rare, or found only in early Latin: as, scala, a ladder; 
valva, a door; artus, a joint.

Nouns Defective in Certain Cases 
103. Many nouns are defective in case-forms: 1— 
a. Indeclinable nouns, used only as nominative and accusative singular: 
fas, nefas, instar, nihil, opus (need), secus. 
Nore 1.—The indeclinable adjective necesse is used as a nominative or accusative. 
Nore 2.— The genitive nihili and the ablative nihil6 (from nihilum, nothing) occur. 
b. Nouns found in one case only (monoptotes): —

iniussi, nati, and many other verbal nouns in -us (m.) (§ 94. ¢). 
Nore.—Ma§ne is also used as an indeclinable accusative, and an old form mani is 
used as ablative. Pondé with a numeral is often apparently equivalent to pounds. A 
nominative singular astus and a plural astiis occur rarely in later writers. 
6. In the accusative plural : infitias.

rds, sal, sdl, vas (vadis), want the genitive plural. 
8. Most nouns of the fifth declension want the whole or part of the plural 
(see § 98. a). 
h. Nouns defective in both singular and plural : — 
1. Noun found in the genitive, accusative, ablative singular; nominative, 
accusative, dative, ablative plural: vicis, -em, -e; -és, -ibus. 
2. Noun found in the genitive, dative, accusative, and ablative singular; 
genitive plural wanting: dapis, -i, -em, -e; -és, -ibus.? 
VARIABLE NOUNS 
104. Many nouns vary either in Declension or in Gender. 
“105. Nouns that vary in Declension are called heteroclites.4 
a. Colus (¥.), distaff; domus (¥.), house (see § 93), and many names 
of plants in -us, vary between the Second and Fourth Declensions. 
6. Some nouns vary between the Second and Third: as, itigerum, -i, -6, 
ablative - or -e, plural -a, -um, -ibus; Mulciber, genitive -beri and -beris; 
sequester, genitive -tri and -tris; vas, vasis, and (old) vasum, -i (§ 79. e). 
e. Some vary between the Second, Third, and Fourth: as, penus, penum, 
genitive peni and penoris, ablative pent. 
d. Many nouns vary between the First and Fifth (see § 98. c). 
e. Some vary between the Third and Fifth. Thus, —requiés has geni- 
tive -€tis, dative wanting, accusative -étem or -em, ablative -€ (once -éte) ; 
famés, regularly of the third declension, has ablative famé (§ 76. Nn. 1), 
and piibés (m.) has once dative pibé (in Plautus). 
f. Pecus varies between the Third and Fourth, having pecoris, etc., but 
also nominative peci, ablative pect; plural pecua, genitive pecuum. 
g-» Many vary between different stems of the same declension : as, femur 
(x.), genitive -oris, also -inis (as from }femen); iecur (N.), genitive iecinoris, 
iocinoris, iecoris ; minus (N.), plural miinera and miinia. 
1 The ablative plural Gribus is rare, the classical idiom being in dre omnium, in every- 
body’s mouth, etc., not in dribus omnium, 
2 The genitive plural ossium is late; ossuum (from ossua, plural of a neuter u-stem) 
is early and late. 
8 An old nominative daps is cited.

a. The following have a masculine form in -us and a neuter in -um: 
balteus, cAseus, clipeus, collum, cingulum, pileus, tergum, vallum, with many 
others of rare occurrence. 
b. The following have in the Plural a different gender from that of the 
Singular : — 
palneum (N.), bath ; 
caelum (N.), heaven ; 
carbasus (F.), @ sail; balneae (r.), baths (an establishment). 
caelds (M. acc., Lucr.).

  § 108] NAMES OF PERSONS 45 
NAMES OF PERSONS 
108. A Roman had regularly three names:— (1) the praendmen, 
or personal name; (2) the ndmen, or name of the géns or house ; 
(8) the cégndmen, or family name : — 
Thus in Marcus Tullius Cicerd we have — 
Marcus, the praendmen, like our Christian or given name ; 
Tullius, the némen, properly an adjective denoting of the Tullian géns (or 
house) whose original head was a real or supposed Tullus ; 
Cicerd, the cognomen, or family name, often in origin a nickname, —in this 
case from cicer, a vetch, or small pea. 
Norsz.— When two persons of the same family are mentioned together, the cdgné- 
men is usually put in the plural: as, Piblius et Servius Sullae. 
a. A fourth or fifth name was sometimes given as a mark of honor or 
distinction, or to show adoption from another géns. 
Thus the complete name of Scipio the Younger was Pablius Cornélius Scipio 
Africinus Aemilianus : Africanus, from his exploits in Africa; Aemilianus, as 
adopted from the Amilian géns.1 
Norr.— The Romans of the classical period had no separate name for these addi- 
tions, but later grammarians invented the word agnémen to express them. 
6. Women had commonly in classical times no personal names, but were 
known only by the ndnien of their géns. 
Thus, the wife of Cicero was Terentia, and his daughter Tullia. A second 
daughter would have been called Tullia secunda or minor, a third daughter, Tullia 
tertia, and so on. 
c. The commonest prenomens are thus abbreviated : — 
A. Aulus. L. Licius. Q. Quintus. 
App. (Ap.) Appius. M. Marcus. Ser. Servius. 
C. (G.) Gaius (Caius) (cf. § 1. a). MW’. Manius. Sex. (S.) Sextus. 
Cn. (Gn.) Gnaeus (Cneius). Mam. Mamercus. Sp. Spurius. 
D. Decimus. N. (Num.) Numerius T. Titus. 
K. Kaesd (Caeso). P. Pablius. Ti. (Tib.) Tiberius. 
Nors 1.—In the abbreviations C. and Cn., the initial character has the value of & 
(1.4). 
1In stating officially the full name of a Roman it was customary to include the 
praendmina of the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, together with the name 
of the tribe to which the individual belonged. Thus in an inscription we find M. TVL- 
LIVS M. F. M. N. M. PR. COR, CICERO, i.e. Marcus Tullius Marci filius Marci nepds Marci pro- 
nepds Cornélia tribii Cicerd. The names of grandfather and great-grandfather as well as 
that of the tribe are usually omitted in literature. The name of a wife or daughter is

DECLENSION OF ADJECTIVES [§§ 109, 110 
ADJECTIVES 
  109. Adjectives and Participles are in general formed and de- 
clined like Nouns, differing from them only in their use. 
1. In accordance with their use, they distinguish gender by different 
forms in the same word, and agree with their nouns in gender, number, and 
case. Thus, — 
bonus puer, the good boy. 
bona puella, the good girl. 
bonum dénum, the good gift. 
2. In their inflection they are either (1) of the First and Second Declen- 
sions, or (2) of the Third Declension. 
FIRST AND SECOND DECLENSIONS (@- AND o-STEMS) 
110. Adjectives of the First and Second Declensions (a- and 
o-stems) are declined in the Masculine like servus, puer, or ager; 
in the Feminine like stella; and in the Neuter like bellum. 
The regular type of an adjective of the First and Second Declen- 
sions is bonus, -a, -um, which is thus declined: —

Nore. — Stems in quo- have nominative -cus (-quos), -qua, -cum (-quom), accusative 
-cum (-quom), -quam, -cum (-quom), to avoid quu- (see §§ 6. b and 46. N.2). Thus, — 
Nom. propincus (-quos) propinqua propincum (-quom) 
GEN. propinqui propinquae propinqui, ete. 
But most modern editions disregard this principle. 
a. The Genitive Singular masculine of adjectives in -ius ends in -ii, and 
the Vocative in -ie; not in -i, as in nouns (cf. § 49. b, c); as, Lacedaemonius, 
-ii, -ie. 
Norx.— The possessive meus, my, has the vocative masculine mi (cf. § 145). 
111. Stems ending in ro- preceded by e form the Nominative 
Masculine like puer (§ 47) and are declined as follows: —

perus), satur (-ura, -urum), tener, with compounds of -fer and -ger: as, saeti- 
Ser, -era, -erum, bristle-bearing ; also, usually, dexter. In these the e belongs to 
the stem; but in dextra it is often omitted: as, dextra manus, the right hand. 
Nore. — Stems in éro- (as procérus), with morigérus, propérus, have the regular nomi- 
native masculine in -us, 
b. The following lack a nominative singular masculine in classic use: 
c&tera, infera, postera, supera. They are rarely found in the singular except 
in certain phrases: as, posterd dié, the next day. 
Norg.— An ablative feminine in -6 is found in a few Greek adjectives: as, lectica 
octdphoré (Verr. v. 27).

a. The plural of these words is regular, like that of bonus (§ 110). 
-6. The genitive in -ius, dative in -i, and neuter in -d are pronominal in 
origin (cf. illius, illi, illud, and § 146). 
c. The iof the genitive ending -ius, though originally long, may be made 
short in verse; so often in alterius and regularly in utriusque. 
d. Instead of alius, alterius is commonly used, or in the possessive sense 
the adjective aliénus, belonging to another, another's. 
e. In compounds —as alteruter—sometimes both parts are declined, 
sometimes only the latter. ‘Thus, alteri utri or alterutri, to one of the two. 
Nore.— The regular genitive and dative forms (as in bonus) are sometimes found 
in some of these words: as, genitive and dative feminine, aliae; dative masculine, 
alid. Rare forms are alis and alid (for alius, aliud). 
THIRD DECLENSION (CONSONANT AND #STEMS) 
114. Adjectives of the Third Declension are thus classified: — 
1. Adjectives of Three Terminations in the nominative singular, — one 
for each gender: as, acer, dcris, acre. 
2. Adjectives of Two Terminations, — masculine and feminine the same: 
as, levis (M., F.), leve (X.). 
8. Adjectives of One Termination, — the same for all three genders: as, 
atrox. 
a. Adjectives of two and three terminations are true i-stems and hence retain 
in the ablative singular -i, in the neuter plural -ia, in the genitive plural -ium, and 
in the accusative plural regularly -is (see §§ 78 and 74).1

a. Like acer are declined the following stems in ri-: — 
alacer, campester, celeber, equester, paliister, pedester, puter, saliiber, silvester, 
terrester, volucer. So also names of months in -ber: as, October (cf. 
§ 66). 
Nore 1.—This formation is comparatively late, and hence, in the poets and in early 
Latin, either the masculine or the feminine form of these adjectives was sometimes 
used for both genders: as, coetus alacris(Enn.). In others, as faenebris, fiinebris, illus- 
tris, ligubris, mediocris, muliebris, there is no separate masculine form at all, and these 
are declined like levis (§ 116). 
Norx 2.—Celer, celeris, celere, swift, has the genitive plural celerum, used only as a 
noun, denoting a military rank. The proper name Celer has the ablative in -e.

Norr.— Adjectives of two and three terminations sometimes have an ablative in -€ 
in poetry, rarely in prose. 
Adjectives of One Termination 
117. The remaining adjectives of the third declension are Con- 
sonant stems; but most of them, except Comparatives, have the 
following forms of i-stems : —1 
-lin the ablative singular (but often -e); 
-ia in the nominative and accusative plural neuter ; 
-ium in the genitive plural ; 
-is (as well as -és) in the accusative plural masculine and feminine. 
In the other cases they follow the rule for Consonant stems. 
a. These adjectives, except stems in 1- or r-, form the nominative singu- 
lar from the stem by adding s: as, atrox (stem atrdc-+ 8), “egéns (stem 
egent- + s).? 
6. Here belong the present participles in -ns (stem nt-)?: as, amans, monéns. 
They are declined like egéns (but cf. § 121),

b. The stem of comparatives properly ended in 6s-; but this became or 
in the nominative masculine and feminine, and 6r- in all other cases except 
the nominative and accusative singular neuter, where s is retained and 8 is 
changed to ti (cf. hondr, Oris; corpus, -Sris). Thus comparatives appear to 
have two terminations. 
e. The neuter singular pliis is used only asanoun. The genitive (rarely 
the ablative) is used only as an expression of value (cf. § 417). The dative 
is not found in classic use. The compound complirés, several, has sometimes 
neuter plural compliria. 
Case-Forms of Consonant Stems 
121. In adjectives of Consonant stems — 
a. The Ablative Singular commonly ends in 4, but sometimes -e. 
1. Adjectives used as nouns (as superstes, survivor) have -e. 
2. Participles in -ns used as such (especially in the ablative absolute, 
§ 419), or as nouns, regularly have -e; but participles used as adjectives 
have regularly 1: — 
domind imperante, at the master’s command ; ab amante, by a lover ; ab amanti 
muliere, by a loving woman. 
   
-P-A-G-E-66
54 DECLENSION OF ADJECTIVES [gs 121, 122 
3. The following have regularly -i: — améns, anceps, concors (and other 
compounds of cor), consors (but as a substantive, -e), dégener, hebes, ingéns, 
inops, memor (and compounds), par (in prose), perpes, praeceps, praepes, teres. 
4. The following have regularly-e : —caeles, compos, [{déses], dives, hospes, 
particeps, pauper, princeps, sdspes, superstes. So also patrials (see § 71. 5) and 
stems in 4t-, it-, nt-, rt-, when used as nouns, and sometimes when used as 
adjectives. 
b. The Genitive Plural ends commonly in -ium, but has -um in the 
following : 1 — 
1. Always in compos, dives, inops, particeps, praepes, princeps, supplex, and 
compounds of nouns which have -um: as, quadru-pés, bi-color. 
2. Sometimes, in poetry, in participles in -ns: as, silentum concilium, a coun- 
cil of the silent shades (Aen. vi. 482). 
ec. The Accusative Plural regularly ends in -is, but comparatives com- 
monly have -és. 
d. Vetus (gen. -éris) and pibes (gen. -éris) regularly have -e in the abla- 
tive singular, -a in the nominative and accusative plural, and -um in the 
genitive plural. For iber, see § 119. 
e. A few adjectives of one termination, used as nouns, have a feminine 
form in -a: as, clienta, hospita, with the appellative Iind Sdspita. 
Irregularities and Special Uses of Adjectives 
122. The following special points require notice : — 
a. Several adjectives vary in declension: as, gracilis (-us), hilaris (-us), 
inermis (-us), bicolor (-drus). 
b. A few adjectives are indeclinable: as, damnis, frigi (really a dative 
of service, gee § 382. 1. n.?), néquam (originally an adverb), necesse, and the 
pronominal forms tot, quot, aliquot, totidem. Potis is often used as an inde- 
clinable adjective, but sometimes has pote in the neuter. 
ce. Several adjectives are defective : as, exspés (only nom.), exléx (exlégem) 
(only nom. and ace. sing.), pernox (pernocte) (only nom. and abl. sing.); 
and primoris, sémineci, etc., which lack the nominative singular. 
d. Many adjectives, from their signification, can be used only in the 
masculine and feminine. These may be called adjectives of common gender. 
Such are aduléscéns, youthful; [tdéses], -idis, slothful; inops, -opis, poor ; 
sdspes, -itis, safe. Similarly, senex, old man, and iuvenis, young man, are some- 
times called masculine adjectives. 
For Adjectives used as Nouns, see §§ 288, 289; for Nouns used as Adjectives, see 
§ 321. c; for Adjectives used as Adverbs, see § 214; for Adverbs used as Adjectives,

  §§ 128-127] COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES 55 
COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES 
123. In Latin, as in English, there are three degrees of com- 
parison: the Positive, the Comparative, and the Superlative. 
124. The Comparative is regularly formed by adding ~ior (neu- 
ter -ius),1 the Superlative by adding -issimus (-a,-um), to the stem of 
the Positive, which loses its final vowel : — 
carus, dear (stem caro-) ; carior, dearer ; carissimus, dearest. 
levis, light (stem levi-) ; levior, lighter ; levissimus, lightest. 
félix, happy (stem félic-); félicior, happier;  félicissimus, happiest. 
hebes, dull (stem hebet-); hebetior, duller ; hebetissimus, dullest. 
Norr.— A form of diminutive is made upon the stem of some comparatives: as, 
grandius-culus, a little larger (see § 243). 
a. Participles when used as adjectives are regularly compared : — 
patiéns, patient ; patientior, patientissimus. 
apertus, open; apertior, apertissimus. 
125. Adjectives in -er form the Superlative by adding -rimus to 
the nominative. The comparative is regular: — 
acer, keen; acrior, acerrimus. 
miser, wretched; miserior, miserrimus. 
a. So vetus (gen. yeteris) has superlative veterrimus, from the old form 
veter ; and mAtiirus, besides its regular superlative (matirissimus), has a rare 
form matirrimus. 
For the comparative of vetus, vetustior (from vetustus) is used. 
126. Six adjectives in -lis form the Superlative by adding -limus 
to the stem clipped of its final i-. These are facilis, difficilis, simi- 
lis, dissimilis, gracilis, humilis. 
facilis (stem facili-), easy; facilior, facillimus. 
127. Compounds in -dicus (saying) and -volus (willing) take in 
their comparison the forms of the corresponding participles dicéns 
and voléns, which were anciently used as adjectives : — 
maledicus, slanderous; maledicentior, maledicentissimus. 
malevolus, spiteful ; malevolentior, malevolentissimus. 
1 The comparative suffix (earlier -iés) is akin to the Greek -(wv, or the Sanskrit -iyans. 
That of the superlative (-issimus) is a double form of uncertain origin. It appears to 
contain the is- of the old suffix -is-to-s (seen in 75-1¢r0-s and English sweetest) and also 
the old -mo-s (seen in pri-mus, mini-mus, etc.). The endings -limus and -rimus are formed 
by assimilation (§ 15. 6) from-simus. The comparative and superlative are really new 
stems, and are not strictly to be regarded as forms of inflection.
-P-A-G-E-68
56 COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES [§§ 127-180 
a. So, by analogy, compounds in -ficus : — 
magnificus, grand; magnificentior, magnificentissimus. 
128. Some adjectives are compared by means of the adverbs 
magis, more, and maximé, most. 
So especially adjectives in -us preceded by e or i: — 
iddneus, jit; magis iddneus, maximé iddneus. 
Norr.— But pius has piissimus in the superlative, — a form condemned by Cicero, 
but common in inscriptions; equally common, however, is the irregular pientissimus. 
  Irregular Comparison 
129. Several adjectives have in their comparison irregular 
forms : — 
bonus, good ; melior, better ; optimus, best. 
malus, bad ; péior, worse ; pessimus, worst. 
magnus, great ; maior, greater ; maximus, greatest. 
parvus, small ; minor, less ; minimus, least. 
multus, much ; pliis (v.) (§ 120), more; plirimus, most. 
multi, many ; plirés, more ; plirimi, most. 
néqutiam (indecl., § 122.6), | néquior; néquissimus. 
worthless ; 
friigi (indecl., § 122. b), use- friigalior ; frigdlissimus. 
Sul, worthy ; 
dexter, on the right, handy; dexterior ; dextimus. 
Norr. — These irregularities arise from the use of different stems (cf. § 127). Thus 
frigdlior and frigdlissimus are formed from the stem frig4li-, but are used as the com- 
parative and superlative of the indeclinable frigi. 
Defective Comparison 
130. Some Comparatives and Superlatives appear without a 
Positive : — i 
Scior, swifter ; Scissimus, swiftest. 
potior, preferable ;1 potissimus, most important. 
a. The following are formed from stems not used as adjectives : ?_ 
1 The old positive potis occurs in the sense of able, possible. 
2 The forms in -tra and -terus were originally comparative (cf. alter), so that the 
vomparatives in -terior are double comparatives. Inferus and superus are comparatives 
of a still more primitive form (cf. the English comparative in -er). 
The superlatives in -timus (-tumus) are relies of old forms of comparison; those in 
-mus like imus, summus, primus, are still more primitive. Forms like extrémus are 
superlatives of a comparative. In fact, comparison has always been treated with an 
accumulation of endings, as children say furtherer and furtherest.
-P-A-G-E-69
  §§ 180, 131] DEFECTIVE COMPARISON 57 
cis, citra (adv., on this side): citerior, hither ; citimus, hithermost. 
dé (prep., down): déterior, worse; déterrimus, worst. 
in, intra (prep., in, within): interior, inner ; intimus, inmost. 
prae, pro (prep., before): prior, former ; primus, first. 
prope (ady., near): propior, nearer; proximus, nezt. 
ultra (adv., beyond): ulterior, farther; ultimus, farthest. 
b. Of the following the positive forms are rare, except when used as 
nouns (generally in the plural) : — 
exterus, outward ; exterior, outer; extrémus (extimus), outmost. 
inferus, below (see § 111.6); inferior, lower; iInfimus (imus), lowest. 
posterus, following ; posterior, latter; postrémus (postumus), last. 
superus, above; superior, higher; suprémus or summus, highest. 
But the plurals, exteri, foreigners ; inferi, the gods below ; posteri, posterity ; 
superi, the heavenly gods, are common. 
Norr.— The superlative postumus has the special sense of ast-born, and was a well- 
known surname. 
181. Several adjectives lack the Comparative or the Superla- 
tive: 
a. The Comparative is rare or wanting in the following : —   
pellus, inclutus (or inclitus), novus, 
caesius, invictus, pius, 
falsus, invitus, Sacer, 
fidus (with its compounds), meritus, vafer. 
b. The Superlative is wanting in many adjectives in -ilis or -bilis (as, 
agilis, probabilis), and in the following : — 
Actudsus exilis proclivis surdus 
agrestis ingéns propinquus taciturnus

ce. From iuyenis, youth, senex, old man (cf. § 122. d), are formed the com- 
paratives iiimior, younger, senior, older. For these, however, minor nati and 
maior nati are sometimes used (nati being often omitted). 
The superlative is regularly expressed by minimus and maximus, with 
or without nati. 
Norr,— In these phrases nati is ablative of specification (see § 418). 
d. Many adjectives (as aureus, golden) are from their meaning incapable 
of comparison. 
Norr.— But each language has its own usage in this respect. Thus, niger, glossy 
black, and candidus, shining white, are compared ; but not ater or albus, meaning abso- 
lute dead black or white (except that Plautus once has atrior),

132. The Latin Numerals may be classified as follows: — 
I. NumeraL ADJECTIVES: 
1. Cardinal Numbers, answering the question how many? as, tinus, one ; 
duo, two, etc. 
2. Ordinal Numbers,! adjectives derived (in most cases) from the Cardi- 
nals, and answering the question which in order? as, primus, jirst ; secun- 
dus, second, etc. 
8. Distributive Numerals, answering the question how many at a time? 
as, singuli, one at a time ; bint, two by two, etc. 
Il. Numerat Apverss, answering the question how often? as, semel, 
once ; bis, twice, etc.

18. duodéviginti (octédecim)  duodévicénsimus (octavus decimus) XVIII 
1 The Ordinals (except secundus, tertius, octavus, ndnus) are formed by means of suf- 
fixes related to those used in the superlative and in part identical with them. Thus, 
decimus (compare the form infimus) may be regarded as the last of a series of ten; pri- 
mus is a superlative of a stem akin to pro; the forms in-tus (quartus, quintus, sextus) may 
be compared with the corresponding Greek forms in -ros, and with superlatives in 
-to-T0-s, while the others have the superlative ending -timus (changed to-simus). Ofthe 
exceptions, secundus is a participle of sequor; alter is a comparative form (compare 
repos in Greek), and nénus is contracted from {novenos. The cardinal multiples of ten 
are compounds of -gint- ‘ten’ (a fragment of a derivative from decem),

NorE 2.—The forms octédecim, novendecim are rare, duodéviginti (two from twenty), 
iindéviginti (one from twenty), being used instead. So 28, 29; 38, 39; etc. may be 
expressed either by the subtraction of two and one or by the addition of eight and 
nine respectively. 
Declension of Cardinals and Ordinals 
134, Of the Cardinals only tinus, duo, trés, the hundreds above 
one hundred, and mille when used as a noun, are declinable. 
a. For the declension of iinus, see §113. It often has the meaning of 
same or only. The plural is used in this sense; but also, as a simple nu- 
meral, to agree with a plural noun of a singular meaning: as, tina castra, 
one camp (cf. § 1387.6). The plural occurs also in the phrase ini et alteri, one 
party and the other (the ones and the others). 
b. Duo,! two, and trés, three, are thus declined : — 
1 The form in -0 is a remnant of the dual number, which was lost in Latin, but is 
found in cognatelanguages. So inambd, both, which preserves-6 (cf. ddw and § 629. b).

Norr.— Ambi, both, is declined like duo, 
c. The hundreds, up to 1000, are adjectives of the First and Second 
Declensions, and are regularly declined like the plural of bonus. 
d. Mille, a thousand, is in the singular an indeclinable adjective : — 
mille modis, in a thousand ways. 
cum mille hominibus, with a thousand men. 
mille trahéns varids coldrés (Aen. iv. 701), drawing out a thousand various 
colors. 
In the plural it is used as a neuter noun, and is declined like the plural 
of sedile (§ 69): milia, milium, milibus, etc. 
Norr.— The singular mille is sometimes found as a noun in the nominative and 
accusative: as, mille hominum misit, he sent a thousand (of) men; in the other cases 
rarely, except in connection with the same case of milia: as, cum oct6 milibus peditum, 
mille equitum, with eight thousand foot and a thousand horse. 
e. The ordinals are adjectives of the First and Second Declensions, and 
are regularly declined like bonus. 
135. Cardinals and Ordinals have the following uses: — 
a. In numbers below 100, if units precede tens, et is generally inserted: 
duo et viginti; otherwise et is omitted: viginti duo. 
b. In numbers above 100 the highest denomination generally stands 
first, the next second, etc., as in English. Et is either omitted entirely, or 
stands between the two highest denominations :— mille (et) septingenti 
sexaginta quattuor, 1764. 
Norsz.— Observe the following combinations of numerals with substantives:— 
iinus et viginti milités, or viginti milités (et) tinus, 27 soldiers. 
duo milia quingenti milités, or duo milia militum et quingenti, 2500 soldiers. 
milités mille ducenti triginta iinus, 1231 soldiers. 
ce. After milia the name of the objects enumerated is in the genitive: 
duo milia hominum, two thousand men. 
cum tribus milibus militum, with three thousand soldiers. 
milia passuum tria, three thousand paces (three miles). 
d. For million, billion, trillion, ete., the Romans had no special words, 
but these numbers were expressed by multiplication (cf. § 188. a). 
1 Or, in poetry, bis mille hominés, twice a thousand men. 
 
-P-A-G-E-73
§§ 135-137] DISTRIBUTIVES 61 
é. Fractions are expressed, as in English, by cardinals in the numerator 
and ordinals in the denominator. The feminine gender is used to agree 
with pars expressed or understood :— two-sevenths, duae septimae (sc. partés) ; 
three-eighths, trés octavae (sc. partés). 
One-half is dimidia pars or dimidium. 
Norte 1.— When the numerator is one, it is omitted and pars is expressed: one- 
third, tertia pars; one-fourth, quarta pars. 
Nore 2.— When the denominator is but one greater than the numerator, the numer- 
ator only is given: two-thirds, duae partés; three-fourths, trés partés, ete. 
Nor 3.— Fractions are also expressed by special words derived from as, a pound : 
as, triéns, a third; bés, two-thirds. See § 637. 
Distributives 
136. Distributive Numerals are declined like the plural of 
bonus. 
  Norr.— These answer to the interrogative quoténi, how many of each? or how 
many at a time?

137. Distributives are used as follows: — 
a. In the sense of so many apiece or on each side: as, singula singulis, one 
apiece (one each to each one); agri septéna itigera plébi divisa sunt, i.e. seven 
jugera to each citizen (seven jugera each), etc. 
b. Instead of cardinals, to express simple number, when a noun plural in 
form but usually singular in meaning is used in a plural sense: as, bina 
castra, two camps (duo castra would mean two forts). With such nouns trini, 
not terni, is used for three: as, trina (not terna) castra, three camps; terna 
castra means camps in threes. 
c. In multiplication: as, bis bina, twice two; ter septénis diébus, in thrice 
seven days. 
d. By the poets instead of cardinal numbers, particularly where pairs or 
sets are spoken of: as, bina hastilia, two shafis (two in a set).

Other Numerals 
139. The following adjectives are called Multiplicatives: — 
simplex, single ; duplex, double, twofold ; triplex, triple, threefold ; quadruplex, 
quinquiplex, septemplex, decemplex, centuplex, sésquiplex (1}), multiplex 
(manifold). 
a. Proportionals are: duplus, triplus, quadruplus, octuplus, etc., twice as 
great, thrice as great, etc.

lasting two or three years ; biméstris, triméstris, of two or three months ; biduum, 
a period of two days; biennium, a period of two years. 
¢. Partitives: binarius, ternarius, of two or three parts. 
d. Other derivatives are: tinid, unity; binid, the two (of dice); primanus, 
of the first legion; primarius, of the first rank ; dénarius, a sum of 10 asses ; 
binus (distributive), double, etc.

  §§ 140-143] PERSONAL PRONOUNS 63 
PRONOUNS 
140. Pronouns are used as Nouns or as Adjectives. They are 
divided into the following seven classes :   
1. Personal Pronouns: as, ego, J. 
Reflexive Pronouns: as, sé, himself. 
Possessive Pronouns: as, meus, my. 
Demonstrative Pronouns: as, hic, this; ille, that. 
Relative Pronouns: as, qui, who. 
Interrogative Pronouns: as, quis, who? 
7. Indefinite Pronouns: as, aliquis, some one. 2.

141, Pronouns have special forms of declension. 
Norxr.— These special forms are, in general, survivals of a very ancient form of 
declension differing from that of nouns. 
Personal Pronouns 
142. The Personal pronouns of the first person are ego, J, nds, 
we; of the second person, ti, thou or you, vos, ye or you. The 
personal pronouns of the third person —he, she, it, they —are 
wanting in Latin, a demonstrative being sometimes used instead.

  Norr.—Old forms are genitive mis, tis; accusative and ablative méd, téd (cf. 
§43.N. 1). 
b. The forms nostrum, vestrum, etc., are used partitively : — 
iinusquisque nostrum, each one of us. 
vestrum omnium, of all of you. 
Norr.— The forms of the genitive of the personal pronouns are really the genitives 
of the possessives: mei, tui, sui, nostri, vestri, genitive singular neuter: nostrum, ves- 
trum, genitive plural masculine or neuter. So in early and later Latin we find tina 
vestrarum, one of you (women). 
c. The genitives mei, tui, sui, nostri, vestri, are chiefly used objectively 
(§ 847): — 
memor sis nostri, be mindful of us (me). 
mé tui pudet, I am ashamed of you. 
d. Emphatic forms of ti are tite and titemet (titimet). The other 
cases of the personal pronouns, excepting the genitive plural, are made 
emphatic by adding’ -met: as, egomet, vosmet. 
Norr. — Early emphatic forms are mépte and tépte. 
e. Reduplicated forms are found in the accusative and ablative singu- 
lar: as, mémé, tété. 
f. The preposition cum, with, is joined enclitically with the ablative: as, 
técum loquitur, he talks with you. 
Reflexive Pronouns 
144, Reflexive Pronouns are used in the Oblique Cases to refer 
to the subject of the sentence or clause in which they stand (see 
§ 299): as, sé amat, he loves himself. 
a. In the first and second persons the oblique cases of the Personal pro- 
nouns are used as Reflexives: as, mé vided, I sce myself; té laudas, you 
praise yourself; nobis persuadémus, we persuade ourselves. 
b. The Reflexive pronoun of the third person has a special form used 
only in this sense, the same for both singular and plural. It is thus 
declined : — 
Gen. sul, of himself, herself, itself, themselves 
Dar. sibi, to himself, herself, itself, themselves 
Acc. sé (sésé), himself, herself, itself, themselves 
ABL. sé (sésé), [by] himself, herself, itself, themselves 
Norz 1.— Emphatic and reduplicated forms of sé are made as in the personals (see 
§ 143. d, e). The preposition cum is added enclitically: as, sécum, with himself, etc. 
Nors 2.— An old form séd occurs in the accusative and ablative.

  §§ 145, 146] . DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS 65 
Possessive Pronouns 
145. The Possessive pronouns are: — 
First Person. meus, my noster, our 
Suconp Person. tus, thy, your vester, your 
Turd Prrsoy. _ suus, his, her, its suus, their 
These are really adjectives of the First and Second Declensions, and are 
so declined (see §§ 110-112). But meus has regularly mi (rarely meus) in 
the vocative singular masculine. : 
Norxz.—Suus is used only as a reflexive, referring to the subject. For a possessive 
pronoun of the third person not referring to the subject, the genitive of a demonstrative 
must be used. Thus, patrem suum oceidit, he killed his (own) father; but patrem éius 
occidit, he killed his (somebody else’s) father. 
a. Emphatic forms in -pte are found in the ablative singular; sudpte. 
&. A rare possessive ciius (quéius), -a, -um, whose, is formed from the 
genitive singular of the relative or interrogative pronoun (qui, quis). It 
may be either interrogative or relative in force according to its derivation, 
but is usually the former. 
c. The reciprocals one another and each other are expressed by inter sé or 
alter... alterum : — 
alter alterius dva frangit, they break each other’s eggs (one. . . of the other). 
inter sé amant, they love one another (they love among themselves). 
Demonstrative Pronouns 
146. The Demonstrative Pronouns are used to point out or 
designate a person or thing for special attention, either with nouns 
as Adjectives or alone as Pronouns. They are: — hic, this; is, 
ille, iste, that; with the Intensive ipse, se/f, and idem, same;! and 
are thus declined: —

what? is declined in the Singular as follows: — 
M., F, N. 
Nom. quis e quid 
Gey. chius chius 
Dar. cui cui 
Aco. quem quid 
ABL. quo quo 
The Plural is the same as that of the Relative, qui, quae, quae. 
a, The singular quis is either masculine or of indeterminate gender, 
but in old writers it is sometimes distinetly feminine. 
b. The Adjective Interrogative Pronoun, qui, quae, quod, what kind of ? 
what? which? is declined throughout like the Relative : — 
SupsTanTIVE ADJECTIVE 
quis vocat, who calls? qui hom6 vocat, what man calls? 
quid vidés, what do you see? quod templum vidés, what temple do you see? 
Nore. —But qui is often used without any apparent adjective force; and quis is 
very common as an adjective, especially with words denoting a person: as, qui ndmi- 
nat mé? who calls my name ? quis diés fuit ? what day was it? quis homd? what man? 
but often qui homd? what kind of man? nescid qui sis, J know not who you are. 
c. Quisnam, pray, who? is an emphatic interrogative. It has both sub- 
stantive and adjective forms like quis, qui. 
149. The Indefinite Pronouns quis, any one, and qui, any, are 
declined like the corresponding Interrogatives, but qua is com- 
monly used for quae except in the nominative plural feminine :—
-P-A-G-E-81
  §§ 149-151] COMPOUNDS OF QUIS AND QUI 69 
Supsrantive: quis, any one; quid, anything. 
ADJECTIVE: qui, qua (quae), quod, any. 
a. The feminine forms qua and quae are sometimes used substantively. 
b. The indefinites quis and quiare rare except after si, nisi, né, and num, 
and in compounds (see § 310. a, b). 
Nore. — After these particles qui is often used as a substantive and quis as an adjec- 
tive (cf. § 148. 0. N.). 
Case-Forms of gui and quis 
150. The Relative, Interrogative, and Indefinite Pronouns are 
originally of the same stem, and most of the forms are the same 
(compare § 147 with $148). Thestem has two forms in the mas- 
culine and neuter, quo-, qui-, and one for the feminine, qua-. The 
interrogative sense is doubtless the original one. 
a. Old forms for the genitive and dative singular are quéius, quoi. 
b. The form qui is used for the ablative of both numbers and all genders; 
but especially as an adverb (how, by which way, in any way), and in the combi- 
nation quicum, with whom, as an interrogative or an indefinite relative. 
c. Anominative plural qués (stem qui-) is found in early Latin. A dative 
and ablative quis (stem quo-) is not infrequent, even in classic Latin. 
d. The preposition cum is joined enclitically to all forms of ‘the abla- 
tive, as with the personal pronouns (§ 143. f): as, quécum, quicum, quibuscum. 
Nore. — But occasionally cum precedes: as, cum qué (Iuy. iv. 9). 
Compounds of guis and gui 
151. The pronouns quis and qui appear in various combinations. 
a. The adverb -cumque (-cunque) (cf. quisque) added to the relative 
makes an indefinite relative, which is declined like the simple word: as, 
quicumque, quaecumque, quodcumque, whoever, whatever ; chiuscumque, etc. 
Nore. — This suffix, with the same meaning, may be used with any relative: as, 
qualiscumque, of whatever sort ; quanddcumque (also rarely quandéque), whenever ; ubi- 
cumque, wherever. 
b. In quisquis, whoever, both parts are declined, but the only forms in 
common use are quisquis, quidquid (quicquid) and quoqud. 
Nor 1.—Rare forms are quemquem and quibusquibus; an ablative quiqui is some- 
times found in early Latin; the ablative feminine quaqua is both late and rare. Cuicui 
occurs as a genitive in the phrase cuicui modi, of whatever kind. Other cases are 
cited, but have no authority. In early Latin quisquis is occasionally feminine. 
Nors 2.— Quisquis is usually substantive, except in the ablative quéqu6, which is 
more commonly an adjective. 
 
-P-A-G-E-82
70 PRONOUNS [§ 151 
  c. The indefinite ‘pronouns quidam, a certain (one) ; quivis, quilibet, any 
you please, are used both as substantives and as adjectives. The first part 
is declined like the relative qui, but the neuter has both quid- (substantive) 
and quod- (adjective) : — 
quidam quaedam quiddam (quoddam) 
quivis quaevis quidvis (quodvis) 
Quidam changes m to n before d in the accusative singular (quendam, m.; 
quandam, F.) and the genitive plural (quorundam, M., N.; quarundam, F.). 
d. The indefinite pronouns quispiam, some, any, and quisquam, any at all, 
are used both as substantives and as adjectives. Quispiam has feminine quae- 
piam (adjective), neuter quidpiam (substantive) and quodpiam (adjective); 
the plural is very rare. Quisquam is both masculine and feminine; the 
neuter is quidquam (quicquam), substantive only; there is no plural. Uilus, 
-a, -um, is commonly used as the adjective corresponding to quisquam. 
e, The indefinite pronoun aliquis (substantive), some one, aliqui (adjec- 
tive), some, is declined like quis and qui, but aliqua is used instead of aliquae 
except in the nominative plural feminine : — 
SrveuLaR 
M. F N. 
Nom. aliquis (aliqui) aliqua aliquid (aliquod) 
Gun. aliciius aliciius alicius 
Dat. alicui alicui alicui 
Acc. aliquem aliquam aliquid (aliquod) 
ABL. aliquo aliqua aliqua 
PLURAL 
Nom. aliqui aliquae aliqua 
Gen. aliquorum aliquarum aliquérum 
Dar. aliquibus aliquibus aliquibus 
Aco. aliquis aliquas aliqua 
ABL. aliquibus aliquibus aliquibus 
Nors. — Aliqui is sometimes used substantively and aliquis as an adjective. 
f. The indefinite pronoun ecquis (substantive), whether any one, ecqui 
(adjective), whether any, is declined like aliquis, but has either ecquae or 
ecqua in the nominative singular feminine of the adjective form. 
Nore. —Ecquis (ecqui) has no genitive singular, and in the plural occurs in the 
nominative and accusative only. 
g- The enclitic particle -que added to the interrogative gives a universal : 
as, quisque, every one; uterque, each of two, or both. Quisque is declined
-P-A-G-E-83
  §§ 151, 162] CORRELATIVES 71 
like the interrogative quis, qui: — substantive, quisque, quidque; adjective, 
quique, quaeque, quodque. 
In the compound inusquisque, every single one, both parts are declined 
(genitive uniusciiusque), and they are sometimes written separately and even 
separated by other words : — 
né in ind quidem quique (Lael. 92), not even in a single one. 
h. The relative and interrogative have rarely a possessive adjective 
cflius’(-a, -um), older quéius, whose ; and a patrial chids (chiat-), of what 
country. 
a. Quantus, how great, qualis, of what sort, are derivative adjectives from 
the interrogative. They are either interrogative or relative, corresponding 
respectively to the demonstratives tantus, talis ($152). Indefinite com- 
pounds are quantuscumque and qualiscumque (see § 151. a). 
Correlatives 
152. Many Pronouns, Pronominal Adjectives, and Adverbs 
have corresponding demonstrative, relative, interrogative, and 
indefinite forms. Such parallel forms are called Correlatives. 
They are shown in the following table:   
Demon. REL. IntEeRROG. Inver. Ret. InvErF. 
is qui quis ? quisquis aliquis 
that who who? whoever some one 
tantus quantus quantus ? quantuscumque aliquantus

talis qualis qualis ? qualiscumque —— 
such as of what sort? of whatever kind : 
ibi ubi ubi? ubiubi alicubi 
there where where ? wherever somewhere 
eo quo quo? quoéquo aliquo

  72 CONJUGATION OF THE VERB [8§ 158-155 
VERBS 
CONJUGATION OF THE VERB 
153. The inflection of the Verb is called its Conjugation. 
Voice, Mood, Tense, Person, Number 
154, Through its conjugation the Verb expresses Voice, Mood, 
Tense, Person, and Number. 
a. The Voices are two: Active and Passive, 
6. The Moods are four; Indicative, Subjunctive, Imperative, and In- 
finitive.? 
Norn. —The Indicative, Subjunctive, and Imperative are called Finite Moods in 
distinction from the Infinitive. 
ce. The Tenses are six, viz.: — 
1. For continued action, Present, Imperfect, Future. 
2. For completed action, Perfect, Pluperfect, Future Perfect, 
The Indicative Mood has all six tenses, but the Subjunctive has no 
future or future perfect, and the Imperative has only the present and the 
future. The Infinitive has the present, perfect, and future. 
d. The Persons are three: First, Second, and Third. 
e. The Numbers are two: Singular and Plural. 
Noun and Adjective Forms 
155. The following Noun and Adjective forms are also included 
in the inflection of the Latin Verb: — 
a. Four Participles,? viz.; — 
Active: the Present and Future Participles. 
Passive: the Perfect Participle and the Gerundive.* 
6. The Gerund: this is in form a neuter noun of the second declension, 
used only in the oblique cases of the singular. 
e. The Supine: this is in form a verbal noun of the fourth declension 
in the accusative (-um) and dative or ablative (-i)* singular. 
1 The Infinitive is strictly the locative case of an abstract noun, expressing the 
action of the verb (§ 451). 
2 The Participles are adjectives in inflection and meaning, but have the power of 
verbs in construction and in distinguishing time. 
8 The Gerundive is also used as an adjective of necessity, duty, ete. (§ 158. d). In 
late use it became a Future Passive Participle. 4 Originally locative. 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
§§ 166, 157] VOICES AND MOODS 78 
SIGNIFICATION OF THE ForMS oF THE VERB 
Voices 
156. The Active and Passive Voices in Latin generally cor- 
respond to the active and passive in English; but — 
a. The passive voice often has a reflexive meaning : — 
ferré accingor, I gird myself with my sword. 
Turnus vertitur, Turnus turns (himself). 
induitur vestem, he puts on his (own) clothes. 
Nore. — This use ¢orresponds very nearly to the Greek Middle voice, and is doubt- 
less a survival of the original meaning of the passive (p. 76, footnote 2). 
b. Many verbs are passive in form, but active or reflexive in meaning. 
These are called Deponents (§ 190):1 as, hortor, I exhort; sequor, I follow. 
c. Some verbs with active meaning have the passive form in the perfect 
tenses; these are called Semi-Deponents: as, auded, audére, ausus sum, dare. 
Moods 
157. The Moods are used as follows: — 
a. The Indicative Mood is used for most direct assertions and interroga- 
tions: as,—valésne? valed, are you well? I am well. 
b. The Subjunctive Mood has many idiomatic uses, as in commands, condi- 
tions, and various dependent clauses. It is often translated by the English 
Indicative; frequently by means of the auxiliaries may, might, would, should ;? 
sometimes by the (rare) Subjunctive; sometimes by the Infinitive; and 
often by the Imperative, especially in prohibitions. A few characteristic 
examples of its use are the following : — 
eamus, let us go; né@ abeat, let him not depart. 
adsum ut videam, I am here to see (that I may see). 
tii n& quaesieris, do not thou inquire. 
beatus sis, may you be blessed. 
quid morer, why should I delay ? 
nesci6d quid scribam, I know not what to write. 
si moneam, audiat, if I should warn, he would hear. 
1 That is, verbs which have laid aside (dépdnere) the passive meaning. 
2 The Latin uses the subjunctive in many cases where we use the indicative; and 
we use a colorless auxiliary in many cases where the Latin employs a separate verb 
with more definite meaning. Thus, I may write is often not scribam (subjunctive), but 
licet mihi scribere; I can write is pessum scribere; I would write is scribam, scriberem, 
or seribere velim (vellem) ; Ishould write, (if, etc.), scriberem (si) . . ., or (implying duty) 
oportet mé scribere. : 
   
-P-A-G-E-86
14 CONJUGATION OF THE VERB [S$ 157, 158 
c. The Imperative is used for exhortation, entreaty, or command ; but the 
Subjunctive is often used instead (§§ 439, 450): — 
liber estd, he shall be free. 
né ossa legitd, do not gather the bones. 
d. The Infinitive is used chiefly as an indeclinable noun, as the subject 
or complement of another verb (§§ 452,456.N.). In special constructions it 
takes the place of the Indicative, and may be translated by that mood in 
English (see Indirect Discourse, § 580 ff.). 
Norr. —For the Syntax of the Moods, see § 436 ff. 
Participles 
158. The Participles are used as follows: — 
a. The.Present Participle (ending in -ns) has commonly the same 
meaning and use as the English participle in -ing; as, vocans, call- 
ing ; legentés, reading. (For its inflection, see egéns, § 118.) 
b. The Future Participle (ending in -irus) is oftenest used to ex- 
press what is likely or about to happen: as, réctiirus, about to rule ; 
auditirus, about to hear. 
Norr. —With the tenses of esse, to be, it forms the First Periphrastic Conjugation 
(see § 195): as, urbs est casiira, the city is about to fall; mansiirus eram, I was going 
to stay. 4 
ce. The Perfect Participle (ending in -tus, -sus) has two uses : — 
1. It is sometimes equivalent to the English perfect passive participle : 
as, téctus, sheltered ; acceptus, accepted ; ictus, having been struck ; and often 
has simply an adjective meaning: as, acceptus, acceptable. 
2. It is used with the verb to be (esse) to form certain tenses of the pas- 
sive: as, vocatus est, he was (has been) called. 
Norr.— There is no Perfect Active or Present Passive Participle in Latin. For 
substitutes see §§ 492, 493. “4 
da. The Gerundive (ending in -ndus), has two uses : — 
1. It is often used as an adjective implying obligation, necessity, or 
propriety (ought or must): as, audiendus est, he must be heard. 
Norr. — When thus used with the tenses of the verb fo be (esse) it forms the Second 
Periphrastic Conjugation: déligendus erat, he ought to have been chosen (§ 196). 
2. In the oblique cases the Gerundive commonly has the same meaning 
as the Gerund (cf. § 159. a), though its construction is different. (For 
examples, see § 503 ff.)
-P-A-G-E-87
Sa a a a a a a a a 
§§ 159-162] TENSES OF THE FINITE VERB 75 
Gerund and Supine 
159. The Gerund and Supine are used as follows: — 
a. The Gerund is a verbal noun, corresponding in meaning to the English 
verbal noun in -ing (§ 502): as, loquendi causa, for the sake of speaking. 
Norr.— The Gerund is found only in the oblique cases. A corresponding nomi- 
native is supplied by the Infinitive: thus, scribere est iitile, writing (to write) is use- 
Sul; but, ars scribendi, the art of writing. 
b. The Supine is in form a noun of the fourth declension (§ 94. 6), 
found only in the accusative ending in -tum, -sum, and the dative or abla- 
tive ending in -ti, -si. 
The Supine in -um is used after verbs and the Supine in -ii after adjec- 
tives (§§ 509, 510): — 
vénit spectatum, he came to see; mirabile dict, wonderful to tell. 
Tenses of the Finite Verb 
160. The Tenses of the Indicative have, in general, the same 
meaning as the corresponding tenses in English: — 
a. Of continued action, 
1. Present: scribd, I write, I am writing, I do write. 
2. Imeprrectr: scribébam, I wrote, I was writing, I did write. 
3. Furure: scribam, I shall write. 
b. Of completed action, 
4, Perrectr: scripsi, I have written, I wrote. 
5, Piupprrect: scripseram, I had written. 
6. Furure Perrecr: scripserd, I shall have written. 
161. The Perfect Indicative has two separate uses, — the Per- 
fect Definite and the Perfect Historical (or Indefinite). 
1. The Perfect Definite represents the action of the verb as completed 
in present time, and corresponds to the English perfect with have: as, i 
scripsi, J have written. 
2. The Perfect Historical narrates a simple act or state in past time 
without representing it as in progress or continuing. It corresponds to the 
English past or preterite and the Greek aorist: as, scripsit, he wrote.   162. The Tenses of the Subjunctive are chiefly used in depend- 
ent clauses, following the rule for the Sequence of Tenses; but 
have also special idiomatic uses (see Syntax). 
For the use of Tenses in the Imperative, see §§ 448, 449.

  CONJUGATION OF THE VERB [§ 168 
PERSONAL ENDINGS 
163. Verbs have regular terminations! for each of the three 
Persons, both singular and plural, active and passive.2. These are: 
     
  ACTIVE PASSIVE 
SINGULAR : 
1. -m(-6): am-6, J love. -r(-or):  amo-r, J am loved. 
2. -8: ama-s, thou lovest. -tis (re): amii-ris, thou art loved. 
3. +t: amart, he loves. -tur: améa-tur, he is loved. 
PLuRaL 
1. -mus: ama-mus, we love. -mur: améa-mur, we are loved. 
2. -tis: amia-tis, you love. -mini: ama-mini, you are loved. 
8, -nt: ama-nt, they love. -ntur: ama-ntur, they are loved. 
a. The Perfect Indicative active has the special terminations * : — 
Smve. 1. -i: amiaiv-i, I loved. 
2. -is-ti: i, thou lovedst. 
3. -it: +t, he loved. 
Prior. 1. -i-mus: amiav-i-mus, we loved. 
2. -is-tis: amiav-is-tis, you loved. 
8. -Srunt (-8re): | amav-érunt (-ére), they loved. 
6. The Imperative has the following terminations :— 
Present ACTIVE 
Singular Plural 
2. —: ama, love thou. te: ami-te, love ye. 
‘ Fourure Active 
2. -td:  améa-td, thou shalt love. -tite: am{a-tite, ye shall love. 
8. -t6:  ama-to, he shall love. -ntd: ama-ntd, they shall'love. 
1 Most of these seem to be fragments of old pronouns, whose signification is thus 
added to that of the verb-stem (cf. § 36). But'the ending -mini in the second person 
plural of the passive is perhaps a remnant of the participial form found in the Greek 
-Hevos, and has supplanted the proper form, which does not appear in Latin. The per- 
sonal ending -nt is probably connected with the participial nt- (nominative -ns). 
2 The Passive is an old Middle Voice, peculiar to the Italic and Celtic languages, 
and of uncertain origin. 
8 Of these terminations -i is not a personal ending, but appears to represent an 
Indo-European tense-sign -ai of the Perfect Middle. In -is-ti and -is-tis, -ti and -tis are 
personal endings; for -is-, see § 169. c.N. In -i-t and -i-mus, -t and -mus are personal 
endings, and i is of uncertain origin. Both -grunt and -ére are also of doubtful origin, 
but the former contains the personal ending -nt.

Forms oF THE VERB 
< The Three Stems 
164, The forms of the verb may be referred to three stems, 
called (1) the Present, (2) the Perfect, and (8) the Supine stem. 
1, On the Present stem are formed — 
The Present, Imperfect, and Future Indicative, Active and Passive, 
The Present and Imperfect Subjunctive, Active and Passive. 
The Imperative, Active and Passive. 
The Present Infinitive, Active and Passive. 
The Present Participle, the Gerundive, and the Gerund, 
2. On the Perfect stem are formed — 
The Perfect, Pluperfect, and Future Perfect Indicative Active. 
The Perfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive Active, 
The Perfect Infinitive Active. 
8. On the Supine stem are formed !— 
a. The Perfect Passive Participle, which combines with the forms of the 
verb sum, be, to make — 
The Perfect, Pluperfect, and Future Perfect Indicative Passive. 
The Perfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive Passive. 
The Perfect Infinitive Passive. 
6. The Future Active Participle, which combines with esse to make 
the Future Active Infinitive. 
c. The Supine in -um and -i. The Supine in -um combines with iri to 
make the Future Passive Infinitive (§ 203. a). 
Norn, — The Perfect Participle with fore also makes a Future Passive Infinitive 
(as, amatus fore). For fore (futiirum esse) ut with the subjunctive, see § 569, 3. a, 
1 The Perfect Passive and Future Active Participles and the Supine, though strictly 
noun-forms, each with its own suffix, agree in having the first letter of the suffix (t) 
the same and in suffering the same phonetic change (t to s, see § 15. 5). Hence these 
forms, along with several sets of derivatives (in -tor, -tiira, etc., see § 288. b. N.1), were 
felt by the Romans as belonging to one system, and are conveniently associated with 
the Supine Stem. Thus, from pingé, we have pictum, pictus, pictirus, pictor, pictiira; 
from rided, risum (for {rid-tum), risus (part.), risus (noun), risiirus, risid, risor, risibilis.

VERB-ENDINGS 
165. Every form of the finite verb is made up of two parts: 
1. The Srem (see §24). This is either the root or a modification or 
development of it. 
2. The Enprne, consisting of — 
1. the Signs of Mood and Tense (see §§ 168, 169). 
2. the Personal Ending (see § 163). 
‘Thus in the verb vocd-ba-s, you were calling, the root is voc, modified into the 
verb-stem voca-, which by the addition of the ending -bas becomes the imperfect 
tense voecdbas; and this ending consists of the tense-sign ba- and the personal 
ending (-s) of the second person singular.

  80 CONJUGATION OF THE VERB [g§ 167, 168 
167. A long vowel is shortened before the personal endings 
-m (-r), +t, -nt (-ntur): as, amet (for older amé+), habe-t (for habé-t), 
mone-nt, mone-ntur. 
168. The tenses of the Present System are made from the Pres- 
ent Stem as follows: —1 
a. In the Present Indicative the personal endings are added directly to 
the present stem. Thus,— present stem ara-: ara-s, ara-mus, ara-tis. 
b. In the Imperfect Indicative the suffix -bam, -bas, etc. (originally a com- 
plete verb) is added to the present stem: as, ara-bam, ara-bas, ara-bamus. 
Norr.—The form {bam was apparently an aorist of the Indo-European root BHU 
(cf. fui, futiirus, vw, English be, been), and meant J was. This was added to a com- 
plete word, originally a case of a verbal noun, as in I was a-seeing; hence vidé-bam. 
The form probably began in the Second or Third Conjugation and was extended to the 
others. The a was at first long, but was shortened in certain forms (§ 167). 
c. In the Future Indicative of the First and Second Conjugations a similar 
suffix, -bG, -bis, etc., is added to the present stem : as, ara-b6, ara-bis, moné-bd. 
Norx. — The form {bd was probably a present tense of the root BHU, witha future 
meaning, and was affixed to a noun-form as described in b. N. 
d. In the Future Indicative of the Third and Fourth Conjugations the 
terminations -am, -és, etc. (as, teg-am, teg-és, audi-am, audi-és) are really sub- 
junctive endings used in a future sense (see ¢). The vowel was originally 
long throughout. For shortening, see § 167. 
e. In the Present Subjunctive the personal endings were added to a 
form of the present stem ending in & or 4-, which was shortened in certain 
forms (§ 167). Thus, ame-m, amé-s, tega-mus, tega-nt. 
Nore 1.— The vowel é (seen in the First Conjugation: as, am-8-s) is an inherited 
subjunctive mood-sign. It appears to be the thematic vowel e (§ 174. 1) lengthened. 
The 4 of the other conjugations (mone-a-s, reg-a-s, audi-a-s) is of uncertain origin. 
Norr 2.—In a few irregular verbs a Present Subjunctive in -im, -is, ete. occurs: 
as, sim, sis, simus, velim, velis, etc. This is an old optative, i being a form of the Indo- 
European optative mood-sign yé- (cf. siem, siés, siet, §170. b. N.). The vowel has 
been shortened in the first and third persons singular and the third person plural. 
f. In the Imperfect Subjunctive the suffix -rem, -rés, ete. is added to the 
present stem: as, am4-rem, ama-rés, moné-rem, tege-rem, audi-rem. 
Norr.—The stem element -ré- is of uncertain origin and is not found outside of 
Italic. The r is doubtless the aorist sign s (cf. es-se-m, es-sé-s) changed to r between 
two vowels (§ 15. 4). The é is probably the subjunctive mood-sign (see e). 
1 The conjugation of a verb consists of separate formations from a root, grad- 
ually grouped together, systematized, and supplemented by new formations made on 
old lines to supply deficiencies. Some of the forms were inherited from the parent 
speech; others were developed in the course of the history of the Italic dialects or of 
the Latin language itself.

  $§ 169, 170] VERB-ENDINGS 81 
169. The tenses of the Perfect System in the active voice are 
made from the Perfect Stem as follows : — 
a. In the Perfect Indicative the endings -i, -isti, ete, are added directly 
to the perfect stem: as, amay-isti, téx-istis. 
b. In the Pluperfect Indicative the suflix -eram, -eras, ete. is added to the 
perfect stem: as, amay-eram, monu-erds, téx-erat. 
Nors.—This seems to represent an older }-is-Am etc. formed on the analogy of 
the Future Perfect in -erd (older j-is-6: see ¢ below) and influenced by eram (imperfect 
of sum) in comparison with erd (future of sum). 
c. In the Future Perfect the suffix -erd, -eris, etc. is added to the perfect 
stem: as, amay-eré, monu-eris, téx-erit. 
Norr. — This formation was originally a subjunctive of the s-aorist, ending prob- 
ably in f-is-6. The -is- is doubtless the same as that seen in the second person singular of 
the perfect indicative (vid-is-ti), in the perfect infinitive (vid-is-se), and in the plu- 
perfect subjunctive (vid-is-sem), s being the aorist sign and i probably an old stem 
vowel. 
d. In the Perfect Subjunctive the suffix -erim, -eris, ete, is added to the 
perfect stem: as, amAy-erim, monu-eris, téx-erit. 
Nortr.—This formation was originally an optative of the s-aorist (-er- for older 
-is-, as in the future perfect, see c above), The i after r is the optative mood-sign i 
shortened (see § 168. e.N.2). Forms in -is, -it, -imus, -itis, are sometimes found. The 
shortening in -is, -imus, -itis, is due to confusion with the future perfect. 
e. In the Pluperfect, Subjunctive the suffix -issem, -issés, etc. is added to 
the perfect stem: as, amav-issem, monu-issés, téx-isset. 
Norr. — Apparently this tense was formed on the analogy of the pluperfect indica- 
tive in {-is-Am (later -er-am, see b), and influenced by essem {earlior fessém) in its 
relation to eram (earlier tesam).1    
The Verb Sum 
170. The verb sum, be, is both irregular and defective, having 
no gerund or supine, and no participle but the future, 
Its conjugation is given at the outset, on account of its impor- 
tance for the inflection of other verbs. 
1 The signs of mood and tense are often said to be inserted between the root (or 
verb-stem) and the personal ending. No such insertion is possible in a language 
developed like the Latin. All true verb-forms are the result, as shown above, of com- 
position; that is, of adding to the root or the stem either personal endings or fully 
developed auxiliaries (themselves containing the personal terminations), or of imita- 
tion of such processes. Thus vidébamus is made by adding to vidé-, originally a signifi- 
eant word or a form conceived as such, a full verbal form fbamus, not by inserting 
-ba- between vidé- and -mus (§ 168. b).

6. The Present Participle, which would regularly be tsdns,! appears in 
the adjective in-sins, innocent, and in a modified form in ab-séns, prae-séns. 
The simple form éns is sometimes found in late or philosophical Latin as a 
participle or abstract noun, in the forms &ns, being ; entia, things which are. 
Notrr.—Old forms are:—Indicative: Future, escit, escunt (strictly an inchoa- 
tive present, see § 263. 1). 
Subjunctive: Present, siem, siés, siet, sient; fuam, fuds, fuat, fuant; Perfect, fivi- 
mus; Pluperfect, fiivisset. 
The root of the verb sum is ms, which in the imperfect is changed to mR (see § 15. 4), 
and in many forms is shortened to s. Some of its modifications, as found in several 
Janguages more or less closely related to Latin, may be seen in the following table, — 
the Sanskrit syam corresponding to the Latin sim (siem) : —

The Principal Parts 
172. The Principal Parts of a verb, showing the three stems 
which determine its conjugation throughout, are — 
1. The Present Indicative (as, amé) 
2. The Present Infinitive (as, ama-re) 
8. The Perfect Indicative (as, amav-i), showing the Perfect Stem. 
4. The neuter of the Perfect Participle (as, amat-um), or, if that form 
is not in use, the Future Active Participle (amat-irus), showing the Supine 
Stem. } showing the Present Stem. 
173. The regular forms of the Four Conjugations are seen in 
the following : — 
First Conjugation : — 
Active, amd, amare, amavi, amatum, love. 
Passive, amor, amari, amatus. 
Present Stem am4-, Perfect Stem amav-, Supine Stem amat-. 
Second Conjugation : — 
Active, déled, délére, délévi, délétum, blot out. 
Passive, déleor, déléri, délétus. 
Present Stem délé-, Perfect Stem délév-, Supine Stem délét-. 
In the Second conjugation, however, the characteristic é- rarely appears 
in the perfect and perfect participle. The common type is, therefore : — 
Active, moned, monére, monui, monitum, warn. 
Passive, moneor, monéri, monitus. 
Present Stem moné-, Perfect Stem monu-, Supine Stem monit-.
-P-A-G-E-97
  §§ 178, 174] PRESENT STEM 85 
Third Conjugation : — 
Active, tego, teg&re, téxi, téctum, cover. 
Passive, tegor, tegi, téctus. 
Present Stem teg’-, Perfect Stem téx-, Supine Stem téct-. 
Fourth Conjugation : — 
Active, audié, audire, audivi, auditum, hear. 
Passive, audior, audiri, auditus. 
Present Stem audi-, Perfect Stem audiv-, Supine Stem audit-. 
a@. In many verbs the principal parts take forms belonging to two or 
more different conjugations (cf. § 189):— 
1, 2, dom, domare, domui, domitum, subdue. 
2, 3, maned, manére, mansi, mansum, remain. 
3, 4, petd, petére, petivi, petitum, seek. 
4, 3, vincid, vincire, vinxi, vinctum, bind. 
Such verbs are referred to the conjugation to which the Present stem 
conforms. 
Present Stem 
174, The parent (Indo-European) speech from which Latin comes had two main 
classes of verbs: — 
1. Thematic Verbs, in which a so-called thematic vowel (°/o, in Latin 1/a) appeared 
between the root and the personal ending: as, leg-i-tis (for fleg-e-tes), leg-u-nt (for 
fleg-o-nti).1 
2. Athematic Verbs, in which the personal endings were added directly to the root: 
as, es-t, es-tis (root ms), d4-mus (46, root DA), fer-t (ferd, root FER). 
Of the Athematic Verbs few survive in Latin, and these are counted as irregular, 
except such as have been forced into one of the four “regular” conjugations. Even 
the irregular verbs have admitted many forms of the thematic type. 
Of the Thematic Verbs a large number remain. These may be divided into two 
classes : — 
1. Verbs which preserve the thematic vowel e or o (in Latin i or u) before the per- 
sonal endings. —These make up the Third Conjugation. The present stem is formed 
in various ways (§ 176), but always ends in a short vowel °/, (Latin 14). Examples are 
tego (stem teg*/,-), sternimus (stem stern®/,-) for ¢ster-no-mos, plectunt (stem plect*/,-) 
for {plec-to-nti. So ndscd (stem gndsc*/,-) for gnd-sc-6. Verbs like néscd became the 
type for a large number of verbs in -scé, called inceptives (§ 263. 1). 
2. Verbs which form the present stem by means of the suffix y®/,-, which already 
contained the thematic vowel °/,.— Verbs of this class in which any vowel (except 
u) came in contact with the suffix y°/- suffered contraction so as to present a long 
vowel 4-, €-,i-, at the end of the stem. In this contraction the thematic °/, disappeared. 
These became the types of the First, Second, and Fourth conjugations respectively. 
In imitation of these long vowel-stems numerous verbs were formed by the Romans 
themselves (after the mode of formation had been entirely forgotten) from noun- and 
1Cf. Aéy-e-re, Néy-o-uev ; Doric Aéy-o-vTu. 
2 Cf. éo-rl, éo-ré (see p. 83, note).
-P-A-G-E-98
  86 CONJUGATION OF THE VERB [g§ 174-176 
adjective-stems. This came to be the regular way of forming new verbs, just as in 
English the borrowed suffix -ize can be added to nouns and adjectives to make 
verbs: as, macadamize, modernize. 
Thematic verbs of the second class in which a consonant or u came into contact 
with the suffix y°/o- suffered various phonetic changes. Such verbs fall partly into 
the Third Conjugation, giving rise to an irregular form of it, and partly into the Fourth, 
and some have forms of both. Examples are: — (cén)spicid (-spicére) for ¢spekyo ; venid 
(venire) for }(g)vem-y5 ; cupid, cupére, but cupivi; orior, oritur, but oriri. Note, however, 
plus (pluere) for {plu-yo; and hence, by analogy, acué (acuere) for tacu-yo. 
In all these cases many cross-analogies and errors as well as phonetic changes have _ 
been at work to produce irregularities. Hence has arisen the traditional system which 
is practically represented in §§ 175, 176. 
175. The Present Stem may be found by dropping -re in the 
Present Infinitive : — 
amd-re, stem am4-; moné-re, stem moné-; tegé-re, stem teg&-; audi-re, stem 
audi-. 
176. The Present Stem is formed from the Root in all regu- 
lar verbs in one of the following ways : — 
a. In the First, Second, and Fourth conjugations, by adding a long 
vowel (4-, é-, i-) to the root, whose vowel is sometimes changed: as, vocd-re 
(voc), moné-re (MEN, cf. memini), sopi-re (sor). 
Nors.—Verb-stems of these conjugations are almost all really formed from noun- 
stems on the pattern of older formations (see § 174). 
b. In the Third Conjugation, by adding a short vowel &? to the root. 
In Latin this % usually appears as i/,, but e is preserved in some forms. 
Thus, tegi-s (root TEG), ali-tis (aL), regu-nt (REG); buttegé-ris (tegé-re), alé-ris. 
1. The stem-vowel ¢/ (i/y) may be preceded by n, t, or sc:® as, tem-ni-tis, 
tem-nu-nt, tem-né-ris (rem) ; plec-ti-s (pic) ; cré-sci-tis (CRE). 
2. Verbs in -id of the Third Conjugation (as, capid, capére) show in some forms 
an i before the final vowel of the stem: as, cap-i-unt (cap), fug-i-unt (rue). 
c. The root may be changed — 
1. By the repetition of a part of it (reduplication) : as, gi-gn-e-re (Gu). 
2. By the insertion of a nasal (m or n): as, find-e-re (FID), tang-e-re (TAG). 
1 Most verbs of the First, Second, and Fourth Conjugations form the present stem by 
adding the suffix -y°/, toanoun-stem. The of the First Conjugation is the stem-ending 
of the noun (as, planta-re, from planta-, stem of planta), The é of the Second and thei 
of the Fourth Conjugation are due to contraction of the short vowel of the noun-stem 
with the ending -y®/,-. Thus albére is from alb°/,-, stem of albus; finire is from fini-, 
stem of finis. Some verbs of these classes, however, come from roots ending ina vowel. 
2 This is the so-called “‘ thematic vowel.” 
8In these verbs the stem-ending added to the root is respectively -n°/,-, -t%/-, 
80% ars
-P-A-G-E-99
  §§ 176, 177] PERFECT STEM 87 
d. In some verbs the present stem is formed from a noun-stem in u-: 
as, statu-e-re (statu-s), aestu-d-re (aestu-s); cf. acud, acuere.t 
Norr 1.—A few isolated forms use the simple root as a present stem: as, fer-re, 
fer-t; es-se; vel-le, vul-t. These are counted as irregular. 
Norr 2.—In some verbs the final consonant of the root is doubled before the stem- 
vowel: as, pell-i-tis (PHL), mitt-i-tis (arr). 
e. Some verbs have roots ending in a vowel. In these the present stem 
is generally identical with the root: as, da-mus (pA), flé-mus (stem flé, root 
form unknown).? But others, as rui-mus (rv), are formed with an addi- 
tional yowel according to the analogy of the verbs described in d. 
Note.— Some verbs of this class reduplicate the root: as, si-st-e-re (sTA, cf. star). 
Perfect Stem 
177. The Perfect Stem is formed as follows : — 
a. The suffix v (u) is added to the verb-stem: as, yocd-v-I, audi-v-i; or 
to the root: as, son-u-i (sond-re, root son), mon-u-i (monére, Mon treated 
as a root). 
Nore.—In a few verbs the vowel of the root is transposed and lengthened: as, 
stra-v-i (sternd, sTar), spré-v-i (spernd, SPAR). 
6. The suffix s is added to the root: as, carp-s-i (CARP), téx-i (for tég-s-i, 
TEG).* 
Notr.—The modifications of the present stem sometimes appear in the perfect: 
as, finx-i (ric, present stem fingé-), sinx-i (sac, present stem sanci-). 
e. The root is reduplicated by prefixing the first consonant — generally 
with &, sometimes with the root-vowel: as, ce-cid-i (cadd, cap), to-tondi 
(tonded, ToND). 
Norx.—In fid-i (for j fe-fid-i, find-6), scid-i (for } sci-scid-i, scind6), the reduplication 
has been lost, leaving merely the root. 
d. The root vowel is lengthened, sometimes with vowel change : as, lég-i 
(lég-0), ém-i (&m-0), vid-i (vid-e-), fiig-i (fiig-i-d), ég-i (&g-0). 
e. Sometimes the perfect stem has the same formation that appears in 
the present tense: as, vert-i (vert-6), soly-i (soly-0). 
f. Sometimes the perfect is formed from a lost or imaginary stem: as, 
peti-v-i (as if from {peti4, tpeti-re, per). 
1 These are either old formations in -y®/- in which the y has disappeared after the 
u (as, statud for tstatu-y6) or later imitations of such forms. 
2 In some of the verbs of this class the present stem was originally identical with 
the root; in others the ending -y®/y- was added, but has been absorbed by contraction. 
8 The v-perfect is a form of uncertain origin peculiar to the Latin. 
4 The s-perfect is in origin an aorist. Thus, dix-i (for {dics-i) corresponds to the 
Greek aorist @-deé-a (for fé-derxo-a).

  88 CONJUGATION OF THE VERB [8§ 178, 179 
Supine Stem 
178. ‘The Supine Stem may be found by dropping -um from the 
Supine. It is formed by adding t (or, by a phonetic change, s)— 
a. To the present stem: as, ama-t-um, délé-t-um, audi-t-um. 
6. To the root, with or without i: as, cap-t-um (capi6, cap), moni-t-um 
(moned, Mon used as root), cas-um (for tcad-t-um, cap), léc-t-um (LEG). 
Norx 1.—By phonetic change dt and tt become s (éfénsum, versum for {dé-fend- 
t-um, jvert-t-um); bt becomes pt (scrip-t-um for {scrib-t-um) ; gt becomes ct (réc-t-um 
for {reg-t-um) 1 
Norr 2.— The modifications of the present stem sometimes appear in the supine: 
as, tinc-t-um (tingd, 11a@), tén-s-um for jtend-t-um (ten-d-0, TEN). 
Nore 3.— The supine is sometimes from a lost or imaginary verb-stem: as, peti-t-um 
(as if from fpeti-6, {peti-re, prt). 
Norr 4.—A few verbs form the supine stem in s after the analogy of verbs in d 
and t; as, fal-s-um (fall6), pul-s-um (pelld). 
Forms of Conjugation 
179. The forms of the several conjugations from which, by 
adding the verb-endings in § 166, all ae moods and tenses can 
be made are as follows: — 
a. The First Conjugation includes all verbs which add 4- to the 
root to form the present stem:? as, ama-re; with a few whose root 
ends in a (ffor, fa-ri; fl6, fla-re; nd, na-re; std, sta-re). 
1. The stem-vowel 4- is lost before -6: as, amd = tam4-(y)6; and in the 
present subjunctive it is changed to €: as, amé-s, amé-mus. 
2. The perfect stem regularly adds vy, the supine stem t, to the present 
stem: as, ama-y-I, ama-t-um. For exceptions, see § 209. a. 
b. The Second Conjugation includes all verbs which add &- to the 
root to form the present stem: as, moné-re; with a few whose root 
ends in 6; as, fleo, flé-re; ne-6, né-re; re-or, ré-ri (cf. § 176. e). 
1. In the present subjunctive 4 is added to the verb-stem: as, mone-d-s, 
mone-d-mus (cf. § 168. e). 
2. A few verbs form the perfect stem by ‘adie v (u), and the supine 
stem by adding t, to the present stem: as, délé-vy-i, délétum. But most 
form the perfect stem by adding v (u) to the root, and the supine stem by 
adding t to a weaker form of the present stem, ending in i: as, mon-wi, 
moni-t-um. For lists, see § 210. 
1 For these modifications of the supine stem, see § 15. 5, 6, 10. 
2 The present stem is thus the verb-stem. For exceptions, see § 209. a.

re, capé-re; with a few whose root ends in e: as, se-ré-re for {se-se-re 
(reduplicated from sx, cf. situm). 
1. The stem-vowel é is regularly lost before -d, and becomes u? before 
-nt and i before the other endings of the indicative and imperative: as, 
teg-0, tegi-t; tegu-nt; in the imperfect indicative it becomes @: as, tegé- 
bam, tegé-bas, etc.; in the future, é: as, tegé-s (except in the first person 
singular, tega-m, tega-r); in the present subjunctive, 4: as, tega-s. 
Verbs in -id lose the i before a consonant and also before }, i, and & 
(except in the future, the participle, the gerund, and the gerundive). 
Thus, —capi-at, capi-unt, capi-ébat, capi-és, capi-et, capient; but, cap-it 
(not feapi-it), cap-eret. 
2. All varieties of perfect and supine stems are found in this conjuga- 
tion. See lists, §211. The perfect is not formed from the present stem, 
but from the root. 
da. The Fourth Conjugation includes all verbs which add i- to the 
root to form the present stem: as, audi-re.?_ In these the perfect and 
supine stems regularly add v, t, to the verb-stem: as, audi-v-i, audi- 
tum. Endings like those of the third conjugation are added in the 
third person plural of the present (indicative and imperative), in 
the imperfect and future indicative, and in the present subjunctive : 
as, audi-unt, audi-ébat, audi-étis, audi-at, the i being regularly short 
before a vowel. 
e." The Present Imperative Active (second person singular) is the 
same as the present stem: as, ama, moné, tegé, audi. But verbs in -id 
of the third conjugation omit i: as, capé (not fcapie). 
f. The tenses of completed action in the Active voice are all regu- 
larly formed by adding the tense-endings (given in § 166) to the 
perfect stem: as, amav-i, amav-eram, amav-erd, amav-erim, amAv-issem, 
amiay-isse. 
g- The tenses of completed action in the Passive voice are formed 
by adding to the perfect participle the corresponding tenses of con- 
tinued action of the verb esse: as, perfect amatus sum; pluperfect 
amatus eram, etc. 
1 The gerundive varies between -endus and -undus, 
2 A few are formed from noun-stems, as fini-re (from fini-s), and a few roots perhaps 
end ini; but these are not distinguishable in form.

§§ 181-183] PECULIARITIES OF CONJUGATION 91 
Peculiarities of Conjugation 
181. In tenses formed upon the Perfect Stem, v between two 
vowels is often lost and contraction takes place. 
a. Perfects in -vi, -€vi, -Gvi, often contract the two vowels into 4, 6, 6, 
respectively: as, amasse for am4visse; amarim for amaverim; amassem for 
amavissem ; cOnsuérat for cOnsuéverat; fléstis for flévistis; ndsse for novisse. 
So in perfects in -vi, where the visa part of the present stem: as, comm@rat 
for commbverat. 
Notr.—The first person of the perfect indicative (as, amAvi) is never contracted, 
the third very rarely. 
b. Perfects in -ivi regularly omit y, but rarely contract the vowels ex- 
cept before st and ss, and very rarely in the third person perfect :— i 
audieram for audiveram ; audisse for audivisse ; audisti for audivisti; abiit for 
abivit ; abiérunt for abivérunt.   Nors 1.— The forms siris, sirit, siritis, sirint, for siveris etc. (from siverd or siverim), 
are archaic. 
Norr 2.— In many forms from the perfect stem is, iss, sis, are lost in like manner, 
when s would be repeated if they were retained: as, dixti for dixisti (k=cs); traxe 
for traxisse ; Evasti for évasisti; vixet for vixisset; érépsémus for érépsissémus; décésse 
for décessisse. These forms belong to archaic and colloquial usage. 
182. Four verbs, — dicd, diicd, facid, ferd, —with their compounds, 
drop the vowel-termination of the Imperative, making dic, diic, fac, 
fér; but compounds in -ficié retain it, as, cdnfice. 
Nors.— The imperative forms dice, diice, face (never fere), occur in early Latin. 
a. For the imperative of sci6, the future form scité is always used in the 
singular, and scitéte usually in the plural. 
183. The following ancient forms are found chiefly in poetry: : 
1. In the fourth conjugation, -Ibam, -ibé, for -iébam, -iam (future). These 
forms are regular in e6, go (§ 203). 
2. In the present subjunctive, -im: as in duim, perduim, retained in 
religious formulas and often in comedy. This form is regular in sum and 
vol6 and their compounds (§§ 170, 199). 
3. In the perfect subjunctive and future perfect indicative, -sim, -sé: as, 
faxim, fax6, iussd, recépsd (= fécerim etc.) ; ausim (= ausus sim). 
4. In the passive infinitive, -ier: as, vocdrier for vocdri; agier for agi. 
5. A form in -Ass6, -dssere is found used as a future perfect: as, amAssis, 
from amd; levass6, from levd ; impetrassere, from impetro; itidicdssit, from 
iidicd (cf. § 263. 2. b. N.).

  §§ 190, 191] DEPONENT VERBS 105 
a. Deponents have the participles of both voices : — 
sequéns, following. secitirus, about to follow. 
seciitus, having followed. sequendus, to be followed. 
b. The perfect participle generally has an active sense, but in verbs 
otherwise deponent it is often passive: as, merc&tus, bought ; adeptus, gained 
(or having gained): 
ce. The future infinitive is always in the active form: thus, sequor has 
seciitirus (-a, -um) esse (not seciitum iri). 
d. The gerundive, being passive in meaning, is found only in transitive 
verbs, or intransitive verbs used impersonally : — 
hoc cinfitendum est, this must be acknowledged. 
moriendum est omnibus, all must die. 
e. Most deponents are intransitive or reflexive in meaning, correspond- 
ing to what in Greek is called the Middle Voice (§ 156, a. n.). 
f. Some deponents are occasionally used in a passive sense: as, criminor, 
T accuse, or I am accused. 
g- About twenty verbs have an active meaning in both active and 
passive forms: as, mered or mereor, I deserve. 
191. More than half of all deponents are of the First Conju- 
‘pation, and all of these are regular. The following deponents 
are irregular: — 
adsentior, -iri, adsénsus, assent. obliviscor, -i, oblitus, forget. 
apiscor, (-ip-), -i, aptus (-eptus), get. opperior, -iri, oppertus, await. 
défetiscor, fessus, faint. Srdior, -iri, rsus, begin. 
     
     expergiscor, -1, -perréctus, rouse. orior, -iri, ortus (oritirus), rise (3d 
experior, -iri, expertus, try. conjugation in most forms). 
fateor, -éri, fassus, confess. paciscor, -i, pactus, bargain. 
fruor, -i, friictus (fruitus), enjoy. patior (-petior), -i, passus (-pessus), 
fungor, -i, finctus, fulfil. suffer. 
gradior (-gredior), -i, gressus, step. -plector, -i, -plexus, clasp. 
irascor, -1, iratus, be angry. proficiscor, -i, profectus, set out, 
labor, -i, lapsus, fall. queror, -i, questus, complain. 
loquor, -i, lociitus, speak. reor, réri, ratus, think. 
métior, -iri, ménsus, measure. revertor, -i, reversus, return. 
-miniscor, -i, -mentus, think. ringor, -i, rictus, snarl. 
morior, -i (-iri), mortuus (moritirus), die. sequor, -i, seciitus, follow. 
nanciscor, -i, nactus (nanctus), find. tueor, -éri, tuitus (titus), defend. 
nascor, -i, natus, be born. ulciscor, -i, ultus, avenge. 
nitor, -i, nisus (nixus), strive. itor, -i, isus, use, employ. 
Norxr.—The deponent comperior, -iri, compertus, is rarely found for comperi6, -ire. 
Revertor, until the time of Augustus, had regularly the active forms in the perfect sys- 
tem, reverti, reverteram, etc. 
     
-P-A-G-E-118
  106 CONJUGATION OF THE VERB [$§ 191-194 
a. The following deponents have no supine stem : — 
dévertor, -ti, turn aside (to lodge). medeor, -éri, heal. 
diffiteor, -éri, deny. reminiscor, -i, call to mind. 
fatiscor, -i, gape. vescor, -i, feed upon. 
liquor, -i, melt (intrans.). 
Norr.—Deponents are really passive (or middle) verbs whose active voice has 
disappeared. There is hardly one that does not show signs of haying been used in 
the active at some period of the language. 
Semi-Deponents 
192. A few verbs having no perfect stem are regular in the 
present, but appear in the tenses of completed action as deponents. 
These are called Semi-deponents.. They are: — 
auded, audére, ausus, dare. gauded, gaudére, gavisus, rejoice. 
fid6d, fidére, fisus, trust. soled, solére, solitus, be wont. 
a. From aude there is an old perfect subjunctive ausim. The form sddés 
(for si audés), an thou wilt, is frequent in the dramatists and rare elsewhere. 
b. The active forms vapuld, vapulare, be flogged, and véned, vénire, be sold 
(contracted from yénum ire, go to sale), have a passive meaning, and are 
sometimes called neutral passives. To these may be added fieri, to be made 
(§ 204), and exsulare, to be banished (live in exile); cf. accédere, to be added. 
Nots.— The following verbs are sometimes found as semi-deponents: iir6, itirare, 
iiratus, swear; niibd, niibere, nipta, marry; places, placére, placitus, please. 
THE PERIPHRASTIC CONJUGATIONS 
193, A Periphrastic form, as the name indicates, is a “‘ roundabout way of speak- 
ing.” In the widest sense, all verb-phrases consisting of participles and sum are Peri- 
phrastic Forms. The Present Participle is, however, rarely so used, and the Perfect 
Participle with sum is included in the regular conjugation (amatus sum, eram, etc.). 
Hence the term Periphrastic Conjugation is usually restricted to verb-phrases con- 
sisting of the Future Active Participle or the Gerundive with sum. 
Norr.— The Future Passive Infinitive, as amatum iti, formed from the infinitive 
passive of e5, go, used impersonally with the supine in -um, may also be classed as a 
periphrastic form (§ 203. a). e 
194. There are two Periphrastic Conjugations, known respec- 
tively as the First (or Active) and the Second (or Passive). 
a. The First Periphrastic Conjugation combines the Future Active 
Participle with the forms of sum, and denotes a future or intended action. 
6. The Second Periphrastic Conjugation combines the Gerundive with 
the forms of sum, and denotes obligation, necessity, or propriety. 
ce. The periphrastic forms are inflected regularly throughout the Indica- 
tive and Subjunctive and in the Present and Perfect Infinitive.

IRREGULAR VERBS 
197. Several verbs add some of the personal endings of the 
present system directly to the root,! or combine two verbs in 
their inflection. These are called Irregular Verbs. They are 
um, vold, ferd, edd, do, ed, qued, fid, and their compounds. 
Sum has already been inflected in § 170. 
198. Sum is compounded without any change of inflection with 
the prepositions ab, ad, dé, in, inter, ob, prae, pro (earlier form préd), 
sub, super. 
a. In the compound présum (help), pro retains its original d before e:

the supine in -um to make the future infinitive passive (§ 193. N.). The verb 
véned, be sold (i.e. yénum e6, go to sale), has also several forms in the passive. 
6. Tn the perfect system of ed the forms with v are very rare in the simple 
verb and unusual in the compounds. 
¢. ii before s is regularly contracted to i: as, isse. 
1 The root of e6 is x1 (weak form 1). This ei becomes i except before a, 0, and u, 
where it becomes e (cf. e6, eam, eunt). The strong form of the root, i, is shortened 
before a vowel or final -t; the weak form, i, appears in itum and itérus,

206. Many verbs are found only in the Present System. Such 
are maered, -ére, be sorrowful (cf. maestus, sad); feri6, -ire, strike. 
In many the simple verb is incomplete, but the missing parts 
occur in its compounds: as, vadd, vadere, in-vasi, in-vasum. 
Some verbs occur very commonly, but only in a few forms: —

The vowels a and i are pronounced separately (a-is, a-it) except some- 
times in old or colloquial Latin. Before a vowel, one i stands for two (see 
§ 6. c): — thus aid was pronounced 4i-yo and was sometimes written aii.

IMPERSONAL VERBS 
207. Many verbs, from their meaning, appear only in the third 
person singular, the infinitive, and the gerund. These are called 
Impersonal Verbs, as having no personal subject.! The passive 
of many intransitive verbs is used in the same way.

120 CONJUGATION OF THE VERB [g 208 
208. Impersonal Verbs may be classified as follows: — 
a. Verbs expressing the operations of nature and the time of day : — 
vesperAscit (inceptive, § 263. 1), it grows late. ningit, it snows. 
liciscit hic, it is getting light. fulgurat, it lightens. 
grandinat, it hails. tonat, it thunders. 
pluit, it rains. rorat, the dew falls. 
Nore. — In these no subject is distinctly thought of. Sometimes, however, the verb 
is used personally with the name of a divinity as the subject: as, Iuppiter tonat, Jupiter 
thunders. In poetry other subjects are occasionally used: as, fundae saxa pluunt, the 
slings rain stones. 
b. Verbs of feeling, where the person who is the proper subject becomes 
the object, as being himself affected by the feeling expressed in the verb 
(§ 354. 6) :— 
miseret, it grieves. paenitet (poenitet), it repents. 
piget, it disgusts. pudet, it shames. 
taedet, it wearies. 
miseret mé, I pity (it distresses me) ; pudet mé, I am ashamed. 
Nor. — Such verbs often have also a passive form: as, misereor, I pity (am moved 
to pity); and occasionally other parts: as, paenitirus (as from tpaeni6), paenitendus, 
pudendus, pertaesum est, pigitum est. 
e. Verbs which -have a phrase or clause as their subject (cf. §§ 454, 
569. 2):— 
accidit, contingit, évenit, obtingit, obvenit, fit, it happens. 
libet, it pleases. = délectat, iuvat, it delights. 
licet, it is permitted. oportet, it is fitting, ought. 
certum est, %Z is resolved. necesse est, it is needful. 
constat, it is clear. praestat, it is better. 
placet, it seems good (pleases). interest, réfert, i¢ concerns. 
vidétur, if seems, seems good. vacat, there is leisure. 
decet, it is becoming. trestat, superest, it remains. 
Norx.— Many of these verbs may be used personally; as, vacd, I have leisure. 
Libet and licet have also the passive forms libitum (licitum) est etc. The participles 
libéns and licéus are used as adjectives. 
d. The passive of intransitive verbs is very often used impersonally (see 
synopsis in § 207): — 
ventum est, they came (there was coming). 
pignatur, there is fighting (it is fought). 
itur, some one goes (it is gone). 
parcitur mihi, J am spared (it is spared to me, see § 372). 
Nors. — The impersonal use of the passive proceeds from its original reflexive (or 
middle) meaning, the action being regarded as accomplishing itself (compare the 
French cela se fait).

PARTICLES 
213. Adverbs, Prepositions, Conjunctions, and Interjections 
are called Particles. 
In their origin Adverbs, Prepositions, and Conjunctions are 
either (1) case-forms, actual or extinct, or (2) compounds and 
phrases. 
Particles cannot always be distinctly classified, for many adverbs are 
used also as prepositions and many as conjunctions (§§ 219 and 222). 
ADVERBS 
DERIVATION OF ADVERBS 
214. Adverbs are regularly formed from Adjectives as follows: 
a. From adjectives of the jirst and second declensions by changing the 
characteristic vowel of the stem to -é: as, caré, dearly, from carus, dear (stem 
caro-) ; amicé, like a friend, from amicus, friendly (stem amico-). 
Nore. — The ending -é is a relic of an old ablative in -6d (cf. § 43. N. 1). 
b. From adjectives of the third declension by adding -ter to the stem. 
Stems in nt- (nom. -ns) lose the t-. All others are treated as i-stems : — 
fortiter, bravely, from fortis (stem forti-), brave. 
Acriter, eagerly, from acer (stem Acri-), eager. 
vigilanter, watchfully, from vigilans (stem vigilant-). 
pridenter, prudently, from pridéns (stem priident-). 
aliter, otherwise, from alius (old stem ali-), 
Nore. — This suffix is perhaps the same as -ter in the Greek -repos and in uter, alter. 
Ifso,these adverbs are in origin either neuter accusatives (cf.d) ormasculine nominatives. 
c. Some adjectives of the first and second declensions have adverbs of 
both forms (-€ and -ter). Thus dirus, hard, has both diré and divriter ; 
miser, wretched, has both miseré and miseriter. 
d. The neuter accusative of adjectives and pronouns is often used as an 
adverb: as, multum, much ; facilé, easily ; quid, why. 
This is the origin of the ending -ius in the comparative degree of ad- 
verbs (§ 218): as, acrius, more keenly (positive Acriter); facilius, more easily 
(positive facilé). 
Norr. — These adverbs are strictly cognate accusatives (§ 390). 
e. The ablative singular neuter or (less commonly) feminine of adjectives, 
pronouns, and nouns may be used adverbially: as, falsd, falsely; citd,
-P-A-G-E-139
  §§ 214-216] DERIVATION OF ADVERBS 127 
quickly (with shortened 0); récta (via), straight (straightway); crébr, fre- 
quenily ; volg6, commonly ; forté, by chance; sponté, of one’s own accord. 
Nore. — Some adverbs are derived from adjectives not in use: as, abundé, plenti- 
Sully (as if from tabundus ; cf. abundd, abound) ; saepé, often (as if from tsaepis, dense, 
close-packed ; cf. saepés, hedge, and saepid, hedge in). 
  215. Further examples of Adverbs and other Particles which 
are in origin case-forms of nouns or pronouns are given below. 
In some the case is not obvious, and in some it is doubtful. 
1. Neuter Accusative forms: ndn (for né-oinom, later inum), not; iterum (compara- 
tive of i-, stem of is), a second time; démum (superlative of 48, down), at last. 
2. Feminine Accusatives: partim, partly. So statim, on the spot; saltim, at least 
(generally saltem), from lost nouns in -tis (genitive -tis). Thus -tim became a regular 
adverbial termination; and by means of it adverbs were made from many noun- and 
verb-stems immediately, without the intervention of any form which could have an 
accusative in -tim: as, s6paratim, separately, from séparatus, separate. Some adverbs 
that appear to be feminine accusative are possibly instrumental: as, palam, openly; 
perperam, wrongly; tam, so; quam, as. 
3. Plural Accusatives: as, alias, elsewhere ; forés, out of doors (as end of motion). 
So perhaps quia, because. 
4. Ablative or Instrumental forms: qua, where; intra, within; extra, outside; qui, 
how; aliqui, somehow ; foris, out of doors; qué, whither; aded, to that degree; ultro, 
beyond; citrs, this side (as end of motion) ; retré, back; illéc (for fillé-ce), weakened to 
illic, thither. Those in -trd are from comparative stems (cf. ils, cis, re-). 
5. Locative forms: ibi, there; ubi, where ; ili, illi-c, there ; peregri (peregré), abroad; 
hic (for thi-ce), here. Also the compounds hodié (probably for thédié), to-day; perendié, 
day after to-morrow. 
6. Of uncertain formation: (1) those in -tus (usually preceded by i), with an abla- 
tive meaning: as, funditus, from the bottom, utterly; divinitus, from above, provi- 
dentially; intus, within; penitus, within; (2) those in -dem, -dam, -d6: as, quidem, 
indeed; quondam, once; quando (cf. ddnec), when; (3) dum (probably accusative of 
time), while; iam, now. 
216. A phrase or short sentence has sometimes grown together 
into an adverb (cf. notwithstanding, nevertheless, besides): — 
postmodo, presently (a short time after). 
dénud (for dé novd), anew. 
vidélicet (for vidé licet), to wit (see, you may). 
nihildminus, nevertheless (by nothing the less). 
Norn. — Other examples are: —antea, old antided, before (ante ea, probably abla- 
tive or instrumental) ; ilicd (in locd), on the spot, immediately; prorsus, absolutely (pro 
vorsus, straight ahead) ; riirsus (re-vorsus), again; quotannis, yearly (quot annis, as many 
years as there are) ; quam-ob-rem, wherefore ; cominus, hand to hand (con manus) ; minus, 
at long range (ex manus) ; nimirum, without doubt (ai mirum); ob-viam (as in ire obviam, 
to go to meet) ; pridem (cf. prae and -dem in i-dem), for some time; forsan (fors an), per- 
haps (it’s a chance whether); forsitan (fors sit an), perhaps (it would be a chance 
whether) ; scilicet (fsci, licet), that is to say (know, you may; cf. i-licet, you may go) ; 
Actiitum (Acti, on the act, and tum, then).

PREPOSITIONS 
219. Prepositions were nosoriginally distinguished from Adverbs in form or mean- 
ing, but have become specialized in use. They developed comparatively late in the 
history of language. In the early stages of language development the cases alone 
were sufficient to indicate the sense, but, as the force of the case-endings weakened, 
adverbs were used for greater precision (cf. § 338). These adverbs, from their habitual 
association with particular cases, became Prepositions; but many retained also their 
independent function as adverbs. 
Most prepositions are true case-forms: as, the comparative ablativesextra, infra, supra 
(for textera, tinfera, }supera), and the accusatives circum, céram, cum (cf. § 215). Circiter 
is an adverbial formation from circum (cf. § 214. b. N.); praeter is the comparative of 
prae, propter of prope.1 Of the remainder, versus is a petrified nominative (participle 
of vertd) ; adversus is a compound of versus; trans is probably an old present participle 
(cf. in-tré-re) ; while the origin of the brief forms ab, ad, dé, ex, ob, is obscure and 
doubtful. 
220. Prepositions are regularly used either with the Accusa- 
tive or with the Ablative. 
a. The following prepositions are used with the Accusative : — 
ad, to. circiter, about. intra, inside. 
adversus, against. cis, citra, this side. ifixta, near. 
adversum, towards. contra, against. ob, on account of. 
ante, before. erga, towards. penes, in the power of. 
apud, at, near. extra, outside. per, through. 
circa, around. infra, below. pone, behind. 
circum, around. inter, among. post, after. 
1 The case-form of these prepositions in -ter is doubtful.  
-P-A-G-E-143
  §§ 220, 221] - PREPOSITIONS 131 
praeter, beyond. secundum, next to. ultra, on the further side. 
prope, near. supra, above. versus, towards. 
propter, on account of. —_‘ trans, across. 
b. The following prepositions are used with the Ablative : — + 
4, Ab, abs, away from, by. &, ex, out of. 
absque, without, but for. prae, in comparison with. 
coram, in presence of. pro, in front of, for. 
cum, with. sine, without. 
dé, from. tenus, up to, as far as. 
c. The following may be used with either the Accusative or the Abla- 
tive, but with a difference in meaning : — 
in, into, in. sub, under. 
subter, beneath. super, above. 
In and sub, when followed by the accusative, indicate motion to, when by 
the ablative, rest in, a place: 
venit in aedis, he came into the house; erat in aedibus, he was in the house. 
disciplina in Britannia reperta atque inde in Galliam translata esse existi- 
matur, the system is thought to have been discovered in Great Britain and 
thence brought over to Gaul. 
sub ilice cOnséderat, he had seated himself under an ilex.

laws).

CONJUNCTIONS 
222. Conjunctions, like prepositions (cf. § 219), are closely related to adverbs, and 
are either petrified cases of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives, or obscured phrases: as, 
quod, an old accusative; dum, probably an old accusative (cf. tum, cum) ; vérd, an old 
neuter ablative of vérus; nihilominus, none the less; proinde, lit. forward from there. 
Most conjunctions are connected with pronominal adverbs, which cannot always be re- 
ferred to their original case-forms. 
223. Conjunctions connect words, phrases, or sentences. They 
are of two classes, Coérdinate and Subordinate : — 
a. Coérdinate, connecting codrdinate or similar constructions (see § 278, 
2.a). These are: — 
1. Copulative or’ disjunctive, implying a connection or separation of thought 
as well as of words: as, et, and; aut, or; neque, nor. 
2. Adversative, implying a connection of words, but a contrast in thought: 
os, sed, but. 
8. Causal, introducing a cause or reason: as, nam, for. 
4, Illative, denoting an inference: as, igitur, therefore. 
6. Subordinate, connecting a subordinate or independent clause with 
that on which it depends (see § 278. 2. b). These are: — 
1. Conditional, denoting a condition or hypothesis: as, si, if; nisi, unless. 
2, Comparative, implying comparison as well as condition: as, ac si, as if. 
8. Concessive, denoting a concession or admission: as, quamquam, although 
(lit. however much it may be true that, etc.). 
4, Temporal: as, postquam, after. 
5. Consecutive, expressing result: as, ut, so that. 
6. Final, expressing purpose: as, ut, in order that; né, that not. 
7. Causal, expressing cause: as, quia, because.

distinguished in Latin than in English. The following list 
includes the common conjunctions? and conjunctive phrases :

    140 i FORMATION OF WORDS [$$ 227-280 
FORMATION OF WORDS 
227. All formation of words is originally a process of composition. An element 
significant in itself is added to another significant element, and thus the meaning of 
the two is combined. No other combination is possible for the formation either of 
inflections or of stems. Thus, in fact, words (since roots and stems are significant 
elements, and so words) are first placed side by side, then brought under one accent, 
and finally felt as one word. ‘he gradual process is seen in sea voyage, sea-nymph, 
seaside. But as all derivation, properly so called, appears as a combination of unin- 
flected stems, every type of formation in use must antedate inflection. Hence words 
were not in strictness derived either from nouns or from verbs, but from stems which 
were neither, because they were in fact both; for the distinction between noun-stems 
and yerb-stems had not yet been made. 
After the development of Inflection, however, that one of several kindred words 
which seemed the simplest was regarded as the primitive form, and from this the other 
words of the group were thought to be derived. Such supposed processes of formation 
were then imitated, often erroneously, and in this way new modes of derivation arose. 
Thus new adjectives were formed from nouns, new nouns from adjectives, new adjec- 
tives from verbs, and new verbs from adjectives and nouns. 
In course of time the real or apparent relations of many words became confused, 
so that nouns and adjectives once supposed to come from nouns were often assigned 
to verbs, and others once supposed to come from verbs were assigned to nouns. 
Further, since the language was constantly changing, many words went out of use, 
and do not occur in the literature as we have it. Thus many Derivatives survive of 
which the Primitive is lost. 
Finally, since all conscious word-formation is imitative, intermediate steps in deriva- 
tion were sometimes omitted, and occasionally apparent Derivatives occur for which 
no proper Primitive ever existed. 
ROOTS AND STEMS 
228. Roots! are of two kinds: — 
1. Verbal, expressing ideas of action or condition (sensible phenomena). 
2. Pronominal, expressing ideas of position and direction. 
From verbal roots come all parts of speech except pronouns and certain 
particles derived from pronominal roots. 
229. Stems are either identical with roots or derived from them. 
They are of two classes: (1) Noun-stems (including Adjective- 
stems) and (2) Verb-stems. 
Norx.— Noun-stems and verb-stems were not originally different (see p. 163), and 
in the consciousness of the Romans were often confounded; but in general they were 
treated as distinet. 
230. Words are formed by inflection: (1) from roots inflected 
as stems; (2) from derived stems (see § 232). 
1 For the distinction between Roots and Stems, see §§ 24, 25.
-P-A-G-E-153
  §§ 231-233] PRIMARY SUFFIXES 141 
231. A root used as a stem may appear — 
a. With a short vowel: as, duc-is (dux), puc; nec-is (nex); i-s,id. So 
in verbs: as, es-t, fer-t (cf. § 174. 2). : 
6. With a long vowel?: as, liic-is (liix), LUC; pac-is (pax). So in verbs: 
diic4, is for teis, from eb, ire; fatur from fari. 
c. With reduplication: as, fur-fur, mar-mor, mur-mur. So in verbs: as, 
gi-gnd (root GEN), si-sté (root sTa). 
DERIVED STEMS AND SUFFIXES 
232. Derived Stems are formed from roots or from other stems 
by means of suffives. These are: — 
1. Primary: added to the root, or (in later times by analogy) to verb- 
stems. 
2. Secondary: added to a noun-stem or an adjective-stem. 
Both primary-and secondary suffixes are for the most part pronominal 
roots (§ 228. 2), but a few are of doubtful origin. 
Nore 1.—The distinction between primary and secondary suffixes, not being orig- 
inal (see § 227), is continually lost sight of in the development ofa language. Suffixes 
once primary are used as secondary, and those once secondary are used as primary. 
Thus in hosticus (hosti + cus) the suffix -cus, originally ko- (see § 234. II. 12) primary, as 
in paucus, has become secondary, and is thus regularly used to form derivatives; but 
in pudicus, apricus, it is treated as primary again, because these words were really or 
apparently connected with verbs. So in English -able was borrowed as a primary 
suffix (tolerable, eatable), but also makes forms like clubbable, salable; -some is prop- 
erly a secondary suffix, as in toi/some, lonesome, but makes also such words as meddle- 
some, venturesome. 
Nore 2.—It is the stem of the word, not the nominative, that is formed by the 
derivative suflix. For convenience, however, the nominative will usually be given. 
Primary Suffixes 
233. The words in Latin formed immediately from the root by 
means of Primary Suffixes, are few. For — 
1. Inherited words so formed were mostly further developed by the 
addition of other suffixes, as we might make an adjective lone-ly-some-ish, 
meaning nothing more than lone, lonely, or lonesome. 
2. Bysuch accumulation of suffixes, new compound suffixes were formed 
which crowded out even the old types of derivation. Thus, — 
1 The difference in vowel-quantity in the same root (as Dic) depends on inherited 
variations (see § 17. a).   .

-P-A-G-E-154
  142 FORMATION OF WORDS [8§ 283, 284 
A word like méns, mentis, by the suffix dn- (nom. -0), gave mentid, and this, 
being divided into men + tid, gave rise to a new type of abstract nouns in -tid: 
as, léga-tid, embassy. 
A word like auditor, by the suffix io- (nom. -ius), gave rise to adjectives like 
auditor-ius, of which the neuter (auditérium) is used to denote the place where 
the action of the verb is performed. Hence torio- (nom. -térium), n., becomes a 
regular noun-suffix (§ 250. a). 
So in English such a word as suffocation gives a suffix -ation, and with this is 
made starvation, though there is no such word as starvate. 
234, Examples of primary stem-suffixes are: — 
I, Vowel suffixes : — 
1. o- (™., N.), 4- (F.), found in nouns and adjectives of the first two declen- 
sions: as, sonus, lidus, vagus, toga (root TE@). 
2. i-, as in ovis, avis ; in Latin frequently changed, as in ripés, or lost, as in 
scobs (scobis, root scan). 
8. u-, disguised in most adjectives by an additional i, as in sua-vis (for tsuad- 
vis, instead of tsua-dus, cf. #5¥s), ten-uis (root TEN in tend6), and remaining alone 
only in nouns of the fourth declension, as acus (root ax, sharp, in acer, aciés, 
dxbs), pect, geni. 
Il. Suffixes with a consonant: — 
1. to- (m., N.), ta- (e.), in the regular perfect passive participle, as téctus, 
téctum ; sometimes with an active sense, as in pdtus, pransus; and found in a 
few words not recognized as participles, as pitus (cf. pirus), altus (ald). 
2, ti- in abstracts and rarely in nouns of agency, as messis, vestis, pars, 
méns. But in many the i is lost. 
8. tu- in abstracts (including supines), sometimes becoming concretes, as 
actus, lictus. 
4. no- (m., N.), na- (F.), forming perfect participles in other languages, and in 
Latin making adjectives of like participial meaning, which often become nouns, 
as magnus, plénus, régnum. 
5. ni-, in nouns of agency and adjectives, as ignis, ségnis. 
6. nu-, rare, as in manus, pinus, corni. 
7. mo- (ma-), with various meanings, as in’animus, almus, firmus, forma. 
8. vo- (va-) (commonly uo-, ua-), with an active or passive meaning, as in 
equus (equos), arvum, cdnspicuus, exiguus, vacivus (vacuus). 
9. ro- (ra-), as in ager (stem ag-ro-), integer (cf. intactus), sacer, pléri-que (cf. 
plénus, plétus). 
10. lo- (14-), as in caelum (for tcaed-lum), chisel, exemplum, sella (for tsedla). 
11. yo- (ya-), forming gerundives in other languages, and in Latin making 
adjectives and abstracts, including many of the first and fifth declensions, as 
eximius, audacia, Florentia, perniciés. 
12. ko- (ka-), sometimes primary, as in pauci (cf. radpos), locus (for stlocus). 
In many cases the vowel of this termination is lost, leaving a consonant stem: 
as, apex, cortex, loquax.  
-P-A-G-E-155
  §§ 234-236] DERIVATION OF NOUNS 143 
18. en- (on-, én-, dn-), in nouns of agency and abstracts: as, aspergd, compagd 
(Anis), gerd (-dnis). 
14. men-, expressing means, often passing into the action itself: as, agmen, 
flimen, fulmen. 
15. ter- (tor-, tér-, tor-, tr-), forming nouns of agency : as, pater (i.e. protector), 
frater (i.e. supporter), orator. 
16. tro-, forming nouns of means: as, claustrum (cLAuUD), milctrum (muLG). 
17. es- (os-), forming names of actions, passing into concretes: as, genus 
(generis), tempus (see § 15.4). The infinitive in -ere (as in reg-ere) is a locative of 
this stem (-er-e for t-es-i). 
18. nt- (ont-, ent-), forming present active participles: as, legéns, with some 
adjectives from roots unknown: as, frequéns, recéns. 
The above, with some suffixes given below, belong to the Indo-European 
parent speech, and most of them were not felt as living formations in the 
Latin. 
Significant Endings 
235. Both primary and secondary suffixes, especially in the 
form of compound suffixes, were used in Latin with more or less 
consciousness of their meaning. They may therefore be called 
Significant Endings. 
They form: (1) Nouns of Agency; (2) Abstract Nouns (in- 
cluding Names of Actions); (8) Adjectives (active or passive). 
Norr.— There is really no difference in etymology between an adjective and a 
noun, except that some formations are habitually used as adjectives and others as 
nouns (§ 20. 6. N. 2). 
DERIVATION OF NOUNS 
Nouns of Agency 
236. Nouns of Agency properly denote the agent or doer of an 
action. But theyinclude many words in which the idea of agency 
has entirely faded out, and also many words used as adjectives. 
a. Nouns denoting the agent or doer of an action are formed from roots 
or verb-stems by means of the suffixes — 
-tor (-sor), M.; -trix, F. 
can-tor, can-trix, singer ; can-ere (root CAN), to sing. 
vic-tor, vic-trIx, conqueror (victorious); — vinc-ere (vrc), to conquer. 
ton-sor (for jtond-tor), tons-trix (for 
ttond-trix), hair-cutter ; tond-ére (ronpD as root), to shear. 
peti-tor, candidate ; pet-Sre (PET; peti- as stem), to seck.    
-P-A-G-E-156
  144 FORMATION OF WORDS [$$ 236-238 
By analogy -tor is sometimes added to noun-stems, but these may be stems 
‘of lost verbs: as, via-tor, traveller, from via, way (but cf. the verb invi6). 
Nore 1.—The termination -tor (-sor) has the same phonetic change as the supine 
ending -tum (-sum), and is added to the same form of root or verb-stem as that ending. 
The stem-ending is tér- (§ 234. II. 15), which is shortened in the nominative. 
Nors 2.— The feminine form is always -trix. Masculines in -sor lack the feminine, 
except expulsor (expultrix) and tonsor (tonstrix). 
b. t-, M. or F., added to verb-stems makes nouns in -es (-itis, -etis; stem 
it-, et-) descriptive of a character : — 
prae-stes, -stitis, (verb-stem from root sra, stare, stand), guardian. 
teges, -etis (verb-stem tege-, cf. tegd, cover), a coverer, a mat. 
pedes, ~itis (pés, ped-is, foot, and 1, root of ire, go), foot-soldier. 
  ¢. -6 (genitive -Onis, stem 6n-), m., added to verb-stems? indicates a person 
employed in some specific art or trade : — 
com-bibd (B1B as root in bibé, bibere, drink), a pot-companion. 
gerd, -Onis (cus in gerd, gerere, carry), a carrier. 
Norr.— This termination is also used to form many nouns descriptive of personal 
characteristics (cf. § 255). 
Names of Actions and Abstract Nouns 
237. Names of Actions are confused, through their termina- 
tions, with real abstract nouns (names of qualities), and with con- 
crete nouns denoting means and instrument. 
They are also used to express the conerete result of an action 
(as often in English). 
Thus legid is literally the act of collecting, but comes to mean legion (the body 
of soldiers collected) ; cf. levy in English. 
238. Abstract Nouns and Names of Actions are formed from

Nore 1.—-ti6, -tira, -tus are added to roots or verb-stems precisely as -tor, with the 
same phonetic change (cf. § 236. a. N.1). Hence they are conveniently associated with 
the supine stem (see § 178). They sometimes form nouns when there is no correspond- 
ing verb in use: as, sendtus, senate (cf. senex); mentid, mention (cf. méns); fétiira, off 
spring (cf. fétus); littertiira, literature (cf. litterae) ; cOnsuldtus, consulship (cf. consul), 
Nore 2.— Of these endings, -tus was originally primary (cf. § 234. II. 3.) ; -id isa com- 
pound formed by adding dn- to a stem ending in a vowel (originally i): as, dicid (cf. 
-dicus and dicis) ; -tid is a compound formed by adding 6n- to stems in ti-: as, gradatid 
(cf. gradatim) ; -tiira is formed by adding -ra, feminine of -rus, to stems in tu-: as, 
natira from natus; statira from status (cf. figiira, of like meaning, from a simple u- 
stem, }figu-s; and matiirus, Matiita). 
    239. Nouns denoting acts, or means and results of acts, are 
formed from roots or verb-stems by the use of the suffixes — 
-men, N.; -mentum, N.; -mGnium, N.; -mGnia, F. 
ag-men, line of march, band ; AG, root of agere, to lead. 
cane ae a: } regi- (rege-), stem of regere, to direct, 
certa-men, contest, battle ; certa-, stem of certare, to contend. 
So colu-men, pillar ; md-men, movement ; nd-men, name; fli-men, stream. 
testi-monium, testimony ; testari, to witness. 
queri-monia, complaint ; queri, to complain. 
-mOnium and -minia are also used as secondary, forming nouns from other 
nouns and from adjectives: as, sancti-m6nia, sanctity (sanctus, holy); matri- 
monium, marriage (mater, mother). 
Norx. — Of these endings, -men is primary (cf. § 234. IT. 14) ; -mentum is acompound 
of men- and to-, and appears for the most part later in the language than -men: as, 
momen, movement (Lucr.); momentum (later), So elementum is a development from 
I-M-N-a, l-m-n’s (letters of the alphabet), changed to elementa along with other nouns 
in -men. -ménium and -ménia were originally compound secondary suffixes formed 
from min- (a by-form of men-), which was early associated with mo-. Thus almus

primary suffix. 
240. Nouns denoting means or instrument are formed from roots 
and verb-stems (rarely from noun-stems) by means of the neuter 
suffixes — -bulum, -culum, -brum, -crum, -trum 
pa-bulum, fodder ; pascere, to feed. 
sta-bulum, stall ; stare, to stand. 
vehi-culum, wagon ; vehere, to carry. 
candéla-brum, candlestick ; candéla, candle (a secondary formation). 
sepul-crum, tomb ; sepelire, to bury. 
claus-trum ({claud-trum), bar ; claudere, to shut. 
ara-trum, plough; arare, to plough. 
Nore. —-trum (stem tro-) was an old formation from tor- (§ 234. II. 15), with the 
stem suffix o-, and -clum (stem clo- for tlo-) appears to be related; -culum is the same 
as -clum; -bulum contains lo- (§ 234, II. 9, 10) and -brum is closely related. 
a. A few masculines and feminines of the same formation occur as nouns 
and adjectives : — 
fa-bula, tale ; fri, to speak. 
ridi-culus, laughable ; ridére, to laugh. 
fa-ber, smith ; facere, to make. 
late-bra, hiding-place ; latére, to hide. 
tere-bra, auger ; terere, to bore. 
mulc-tra, milk-pail ; mulgére, to milk. 
241. Abstract Nouns, mostly from adjective-stems, rarely from 
noun-stems, are formed by means of the secondary feminine suf- 
fixes — -ia (-iés), -tia (-tiés), -tas, -tiis, -tidd 
  audac-ia, boldness ; audax, bold. 
pauper-iés, poverty ; pauper, poor.

and appears as i before -tas, -tiis, -tia (as in boni-tas, above). 
2. Consonant stems often insert i before -tas: as, loquax (stem loquac-), 
loquaci-tas; but hones-tas, maies-tas (as if from old adjectives in -es), tiber-tas, 
yolup-tas. oafteriis changed toe: as, pius (stem pio-), pie-tas; socius, socie-tas,

  § 241] NEUTER ABSTRACTS 147 
a. In like manner -d6 and -go (r.) form abstract nouns, but are asso- 
ciated with verbs and apparently added to verb-stems : — 
  
cupi-d6, desire, from cupere, to desire (as if from stem cupi-). 
dulcé-d6, sweetness (cf. dulcis, sweet), as if from a stem dulcé-, cf. dulcé-sco. 
lumba-go, lwmbago (cf. lumbus, loin), as if from jlumbé, -are. 
  Nore. — Of these, -ia is inherited as secondary (cf. § 234. II. 11). -tia is formed by 
adding -ia to stems with a t-suffix: as, militia, from miles (stem milit-); molestia 
from molestus; clémentia from cléméns; whence by analogy, mali-tia, avari-tia. -tas 
is inherited, but its component parts, ta-+ ti-, are found as suffixes in the same sense: 
as, senecta from senex; sémen-tis from sémen, -tis is tii-+ti-, cf. serviti-dd. -d0 and 
-gd appear only with long vowels, as from verb-stems, by a false analogy; but -d6 is 
do-+6n-: as, cupidus, cupidd; gravidus, gravédo (cf. gravé-scd) ; albidus, albédo (cf. al- 
béscd) ; formidus, hot, formids (cf. formiduldsus), (hot flash?) fear; -gd is possibly co-+ 
Gn-; cf. vorax, voragd, but cf. Cethégus.- -tidd is compounded of -d6 with tu-stems, 
which acquire a long vowel from association with verb-stems in u- (cf. voliimen, from 
volv6): as, cOnsuétii-d6, valéti-dd, habiti-d6, sollicitii-d6; whence servitido (ef. servitis, 
-tiitis). 
6. Neuter Abstracts, which easily pass into concretes denoting offices 
and groups, are formed from noun-stems and perhaps from verb-stems by 
means of the suffixes — 
-ium, -tium 
hospit-ium, hospitality, an inn ;1 
collég-ium, colleagueship, a college ; 
auspic-ium, soothsaying, an omen; 
gaud-ium, joy ; 
effug-ium, escape ; 
benefic-ium, a kindness ; 
désider-ium, longing ; 
adverb-ium, adverb ; 
interlin-ium, time of new moon ; 
régifug-ium, flight of the kings ; 
servi-tium, slavery, the slave class ; 
  hospes (gen. hospit-is), a guest. 
colléga, a colleague. 
auspex (gen. auspic-is), a soothsayer. 
gaudére, to rejoice. 
effugere, to escape. 
benefacere, to benefit ; cf. beneficus. 
désiderare, to miss, from {dé-sidés, out 
of place, of missing soldiers. 
ad verbum, [added] to a verb. 
inter lindas, between moons. 
régis fuga, flight of a king. 
servus, a slave. 
Vowel stems lose their vowel before -ium : as, collég-ium, from colléga. 
Norr. —-ium is the neuter of the adjective suffix -ius. It is an inherited primary 
suffix, but is used with great freedom as secondary. -tium is formed like -tia, by add- 
ing -ium to stems witht: as, exit-ium, equit-ium (cf. exitus, equités); so, by analogy, 
calvitium, servitium (from calvus, servus). 
c. Less commonly, abstract nouns (which usually become concrete) are 
formed from noun-stems (confused with verb-stems) by means of the 
suffixes —

DERIVATION OF ADJECTIVES 
242. Derivative Adjectives, which often become nouns, are 
either Nominal (from nouns or adjectives) or Verbal (as from roots 
or verb-stems). 
Nominal Adjectives 
243, Diminutive Adjectives are usually confined to one gen- 
der, that of the primitive, and are used as Diminutive Nouns. 
They are formed by means of the suffixes — 
-ulus (a, -um), -olus (after a vowel), -culus, -ellus, -illus 
riv-ulus, a streamlet ; 
gladi-olus, a small sword ; 
fili-olus, a litile son ; 
fili-ola, a little daughter ; 
atri-olum, a little hall ; 
homun-culus, a dwarf ; 
auri-cula, a little ear ; 
miinus-culum, a little gift ;

minus, n., a gift. 
cédex, a block. 
mis-ellus, rather wretched ; 
lib-ellus, a little book ; 
aure-olus (-a, -um), golden ; 
parv-olus (later parv-ulus), very small ; 
méaius-culus, somewhat larger ; miser, wretched. 
liber, a book. 
aureus (-a, -um), golden. 
parvus (-a, -um), little. 
maior (old maids), greater. 
Norz 1. — These diminutive endings are all formed by adding -lus to various stems. 
The formation is the same as that of -ulus in § 251. But these words became set- 
tled as diminutives, and retained their connection with nouns. So in English the 
diminutives whitish, reddish, are of the same formation as bookish and snappish. 
~culus comes from -lus added to adjectives in -cus formed from stems in n- and s-: as, 
iuven-cus, Aurun-cus (cf. Aurunculéius), pris-cus, whence the cu becomes a part of the 
termination, and the whole ending (culus) is used elsewhere, but mostly with a- and s- 
stems, in accordance with its origin. 
Nore 2.—Diminutives are often used to express affection, pity, or contempt: as, 
déliciolae, little pet ; muliereula, a poor (weak) woman; Graeculus, a miserable Greek. 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  §§ 243-246] NOMINAL ADJECTIVES 149 
a, -cid, added to stems in n-, has the same diminutive force, but is used 
with masculines only: as, homun-cid, a dwarf (from hom6, a man). 
244, Patronymics, indicating descent or relationship, are formed 
by adding to proper names the suffixes — 
-adés, -idés, -idés, -eus, M.; -as, -is, -éis, F. 
These words, originally Greek adjectives, have almost all become nouns 
in Latin: — 
Atlas: Atlanti-adés, Mercury; Atlant-idés (Gr. plur.), the Pleiads. 
Scipid: Scipi-adés, son of Scipio. 
Tyndareus: Tyndar-idés, Castor or Pollux, son of Tyndarus; Tyndar-is, 
Helen, daughter of Tyndarus. 
Anchisés: Anchisi-adés, 4ineas, son of Anchises. 
Théseus: Thés-idés, son of Theseus. 
Tydeus: Tyd-idés, Diomedes, son of Tydeus. 
Oileus: Aiax Oil-eus, son of Oileus. 
Cisseus: Cissé-is, Hecuba, daughter of Cisseus. 
Thaumas: Thaumant-ids, Iris, daughter of Thaumas. 
Hesperus : Hesper-ides (from Hesper-is, -idis), plur., the daughters of Hesperus, 
the Hesperides. 
245. Adjectives meaning full of, prone to, are formed fromnoun- 
stems with the suffixes — 
-dsus, -léns, -lentus 
fluctu-dsus, billowy ; fluctus, a billow. 
form-dsus, beautiful; forma, beauty. 
pericul-dsus, dangerous ; periculum, danger. 
pesti-léns, pesti-lentus, pestilent ; pestis, pest. 
vino-lentus, vin-Osus, given to drink ; . vinum, wine. 
246. Adjectives meaning provided with are formed from nouns 
‘by means of the regular participial endings —

barb-atus, bearded ; barba, a beard. 
turr-itus, turreted ; turris, a tower. 
corn-iitus, horned ; cornii, a horn. 
Norn. —-atus, -itus, -iitus, imply reference to an imaginary verb-stem ; -tus is added 
directly to nouns without any such reference.

  150 FORMATION OF WORDS [§§ 247-249 
247. Adjectives of various meanings, but signifying in gen- 
eral made of or belonging to, ave formed from nouns by means of 
the suffixes — 
-eus, -ius, -Aceus, -Icius, -Aaneus (-neus), -ticus 
aur-eus, golden ; 
patr-ius, paternal ; 
ux6r-ius, uxorious ; 
ros-aceus, of roses ;

praeséns, present. 
extra, without. 
sub terra, underground. 
salix, willow. 
volare, to fly. 
domus, a house. 
silva, a wood. 
Norn. —-ius is originally primitive (§ 234. II. 11) ; -eus corresponds to Greek -etos, 
cos, and has lost a y-sound (cf. yo-, § 234. II. 11); -icius and -aceus are formed by add- 
ing -ius and -eus to stems in i-c-, 4-c- (suffix ko-, § 234. II. 12); -neus is no-+-eus 
(§ 234. II. 4); -dneus is formed by adding -neus to 4-stems; -ticus is a formation with 
-cus (cf. hosti-cus with silva-ticus), and has been affected by the analogy of participial 
stems in to- (nominative -tus). 
248. Adjectives denoting pertaining to are formed from noun- 
stems with the suffixes — 
-alis, -aris, -élis, -ilis, -iilis 
natir-alis, natural ; 
popul-aris, fellow-countryman ; 
patru-élis, cousin ; 
host-ilis, hostile ; 
cur-iilis, curule ; natira, nature. 
populus, @ people. 
patruus, uncle. 
hostis, an enemy. 
currus, a chariot. 
Norr.—The suffixes arise from adding-lis (stem li-) to various vowel stems. The 
long vowels are due partly to confusion between stem and suffix (cf. vita-lis, from 
vita-, with rég-Alis), partly to confusion with verb-stems: cf. Aprilis (aperire), ediilis 
(edere), with senilis (senex). -ris is an inherited suffix, but in most of these formations 
-Gris arises by differentiation for -dlis in words containing an 1 (as milit-aris). 
249. Adjectives with the sense of belonging to are formed by 
means of the suffixes — 
-Anus, -énus, -Inus; -as, -6nsis ; -cus, -acus (-acus), -icus; -eus, 
-€1us, -1clus 
1. So from common nouns : — 
mont-anus, of the mountains ;

Nore. — Of these terminations, -dnus, -€nus,-inus are compounded from -nus added 
to a stem-vowel: as, arca, arcdnus; collis, collinus. The long vowels come from a con- 
fusion with verb-stems (as in plé-nus, fini-tus, tribii-tus), and from the noun-stem in 4-: 
as, arcinus. A few nouns occur of similar formation, as if from verb-stems in 6- and 
ii-: as, colénus (cold, cf. incola), patrénus (cf. patré, -are), tribiinus (cf. tribud, tribus), 
Portiinus (cf. portus), Vaciina (cf. vacd, vacuus).

Nore. — Of these, -ester is formed by adding tri- (cf. tro-, § 234. IT. 16) to stems in 
t-ord-. Thus {pedet-tri- becomes pedestri-, and others follow the analogy. -nus is an 
inherited suffix (§ 234. II. 4). -ernus and -urnus are formed by adding -nus to s-stems: 
as, diur-nus (for tdius-nus), and hence, by analogy, hodiernus (hodié). By an extension 
of the same principle were formed the suffixes -ternus and -turnus from words like 
paternus and nocturnus. 
a. Adjectives meaning belonging to are formed from nouns by means of 
the suffixes — 
-Grius, -t6rius (-s6rius) 
ordin-arius, regular ; 
argent-arius, of silver or money ; 
extr-Aarius, stranger ; 
meri-tirius, profitable ;

lidrius (from peciiliaris), bellatorius (from bellator). 
Nore 2.— These adjectives are often fixed as nouns (see § 254). 
Verbal Adjectives 
251. Adjectives expressing the action of the verb as a quality 
or tendency are formed from real or apparent verb-stems with the 
suffixes — 
-Ax, -idus, -ulus, -vus (-uus, -ivus, -tivus) 
-Ax denotes a faulty or aggressive tendency ; -tivus is oftener passive. 
piign-dx, pugnacious ; 
aud-ax, bold ; 
cup-idus, eager ; 
bib-ulus, thirsty (as dry earth etc.) ; 
proter-vus, violent, wanton ; pignare, to fight. 
audére, to dare.

noc-uus (noc-ivus), hurtful, injurious ; nocére, to do harm. 
recid-ivus, restored ; recidere, to fall back. 
cap-tivus, captive; m., @ prisoner of war ; capere, to take. 
Norn. — Of these, -4x is a reduction of -dcus (stem-vowel 4-+~-cus), become inde- 
pendent and used with verb-stems. Similar forms in -éx, -Ox, -ix, and -ix are found 
or employed in derivatives: as, imbrex, m., a rain-tile (from imber); senex, old (from 
seni-s) ; ferdx, jierce (from ferus) ; atrox, savage (from ater, black); celéx, F., a yacht 
(cf. cello) ; flix, happy, originally fertile (cf. f€10, suck ); fidiicia, w., confidence (as 
from jfidiix) ; cf. also victrix (from victor). So mandiicus, chewing (from mand6). 
-idus is no doubt denominative, as in herbidus, grassy (from herba, herb); tumidus, 
swollen (cf. tumu-lus, hill; tumul-tus, uproar); callidus, tough, cunning (ef. callum, 
tough flesh) ; miicidus, slimy (ef. miicus, slime); tabidus, wasting (cf. tabés, wasting 
disease). But later it was used to form adjectives directly from verb-stems. 
-ulus is the same suffix as in diminutives, but attached to verb-stems. Cf. aemulus, 
rivalling (cf. imitor and imag); sédulus, sitting by, attentive (cf. domi-seda, home- 
staying, and séd0, set, settle, hence calm); pendulus, hanging (cf. pondd, ablative, in 
weight ; perpendiculum, a plummet ; appendix, an addition); stragulus, covering (cf. 
stragés) ; legulus, @ picker (cf. sacri-legus, a picker up of things sacred). 
-vus seems originally primary (cf. § 234. II. 8), but -ivus and -tivus have become 
secondary and are used with nouns: as, aestivus, of summer (from aestus, heat) ; 
tempestivus, timely (from tempus) ; cf. domes-ticus (from domus). 
252. Adjectives expressing passive qualities, but occasionally 
active, are formed by means of the suffixes — 
-ilis, -bilis, -ius, -tilis (silis) 
    frag-ilis, frail ; frangere (rraa), to break. 
n6-bilis, well known, famous ; ndscere (GNo), to know. 
exim-ius, choice, rare (cf. &-greg-ius) ; eximere, to take out, select. 
ag-ilis, active ; agere, to drive. 
hab-ilis, handy ; habére, to hold. 
al-tilis, fattened (see note) ; alere, to nourish. 
Norr.— Of these, -ius is primary, but is also used as secondary (cf. § 241.0.N.). -ilis 
is both primary (as in agilis, fragilis) and secondary (as in similis, like, cf. duos, Opanos, 
English same) ; -bilis is in some way related to -bulum and -brum (§ 240. N.) ; in -tilis 
and -silis, -lis is added to to- (so-), stem of the perfect participle: as, fossilis, dug up 
(from fossus, dug); volatilis, winged (from volatus, flight). 
253. Verbal Adjectives that are Participial in meaning are 
formed with the suffixes — 
-ndus, -bundus, -cundus 
a. -ndus (the same as the gerundive ending) forms a few active or reflex- 
- ive adjectives : — 
secu-ndus, second (the following), favorable 3 sequi, to follow. 
rotu-ndus, round (whirling) 1; rotare, to whirl. 
1 Cf. volvendis ménsibus (Aen. i. 269), in the revolving months ; cf. oriundi ab Sabinis 
(Liv. i. 17), sprung from the Sabines, where oriundi=orti.

  154 FORMATION OF WORDS [S§ 258, 254 
b. -bundus, -cundus, denote a continuance of the act or quality expressed 
by the verb : — 
vita-bundus, avoiding ; vitare, to shun. 
treme-bundus, trembling ; tremere, to tremble. 
mori-bundus, dying, at the point of death ; moriri, to die. 
fa-cundus, eloquent ; fari, to speak. 
fé-cundus, fruitful ; root Fi, nourish. 
ira-cundus, irascible ; ef. irasci, to be angry. 
Nors.— These must have been originally nominal: as in the series, rubus, red 
bush; rubidus (but no frubicus), ruddy; Rubicon, Red River (cf. Minio, a river of 
Etruria; Minius, a river of Lusitania); rubicundus (as in averruncus, homun-culus). 
So turba, commotion; turbs, a top; turbidus, roily, ete. Cf. apexabd, longabd, gravédo, 
dulcédo. 
c. Here belong also the participial suffixes -minus, -mnus (cf. Greek 
-pevos), from which are formed a few nouns in which the participial force is 
still discernible : —1 
fé-mina, woman (the nourisher) ; root Fz, nourish. 
alu-mnus, a foster-child, nursling ; alere, to nourish. 
Nouns with Adjective Suffixes

  156 FORMATION OF WORDS [§§ 255-259 
IRREGULAR DERIVATIVES 
255. The suffix -d (genitive -Onis, stem dn-), usually added to 
verb-stems (see § 236. c), is sometimes used with noun-stems to 
form nouns denoting possessed gf. These were originally adjec- 
tives expressing quality or character, and hence often appear as 
proper names : — 
epulae, a feast; epul-d, a feaster. 
nasus, a nose; nas-d, with a large nose (also as a proper name). 
volus (in bene-volus), wishing ; vol-6nés (plural), volunteers. 
frons, forehead ; front-6, big-head (also as a proper name). 
ciiria, a curia; ciri-d, head of a curia (also as a proper name). 
restis, a rope; resti-0, a rope-maker. 
  a. Rarely suffixes are added to compound stems imagined, but not used 
in their compound form : — 
ad-verb-ium, adverb; ad, to, and verbum, verb, but without the intervening 
tadverbus. : 
lati-fund-ium, large estate; latus, wide, fundus, estate, but without the inter- 
vening tlatifundus. 
su-ove-taur-ilia, @ sacrifice of a swine, a sheep, and a bull; sis, swine, ovis, 
sheep, taurus, bull, where the primitive would be impossible in Latin, 
though such formations are common in Sanskrit. 
DERIVATION OF VERBS 
256. Verbs may be classed as Primitive or Derivative. 
1. Primitive Verbs are those inherited by the Latin from the parent speech. 
2. Derivative Verbs are those formed in the development of the Latin 
as a separate language. 
257. Derivative Verbs are of two main classes : —- 
1. Denominative Verbs, formed from nouns or adjectives. 
2. Verbs apparently derived from the stems of other verbs. 
Denominative Verbs 
258. Verbs were formed in Latin from almost every form of 
noun-stem and adjective-stem. 
259. 1. Verbs of the First Conjugation are formed directly 
from a-stems, regularly with a transitive meaning: as, fuga, 
flight ; fugare, put to flight.
-P-A-G-E-169
  §§ 259-261] DENOMINATIVE VERBS 157 
2. Many verbs of the First Conjugation are formed from o- 
stems, changing the o- into 4. These are more commonly tran- 
sitive: — 
stituld, -are, to incite, from stimulus, a goad (stem stimulo-). 
aequa, -are, to make even, from aequus, even (stem aequo-). 
hibernd, -are, to pass the winter, from hibernus, of the winter (stem hiberno-). 
alb6, -dre, to whiten, from albus, white (stem albo-). 
pid, -dre, to expiate, from pius, pure (stem pio-). 
nov6, -are, to renew, from novus, new (stem novo-). 
aimé, -are, to arm, from arma, arms (stem armo-). 
damn6, -are, to injure, from damnum, injury (stem damno-).    
  8. A few verbs, generally intransitive, are formed by analogy 
from consonant and i- or u-stems, adding a to the stem: —} 
vigil6, -are, to watch, from vigil, awake. 
exsuld, -adre, to be in evile, from exsul, an exile. 
auspicor, -ari, to take the auspices, from auspex (stem auspic-), augur. 
pulvers, -are, to turn (anything) to dust, from pulvis (stem pulver-for pulvis-), 
dust. 
aestué, -are, to surge, boil, from aestus (stem aestu-),-tide, seething. 
levé, -are, to lighten, from levis (stem levi-), light. 
  260. A few verbs of the Second Conjugation (generally in- 
transitive) are recognizable as formed from noun-stems ; but most 
are inherited, or the primitive noun-stem is lost: — 
albed, -ére, to be white, from albus (stem alb*%-), white. 
cAneo, -ére, to be hoary, from canus (stem cin%%/,-), hoary. 
clared, -ére, to shine, from clarus, bright. 
clauded, -ére, to be lame, from claudus, lame. 
alged, -ére, to be cold, cf. algidus, cold. 
261. Some verbs of the Third Conjugation in-ué,-uere, are formed 
from noun-stems in u- and have lost a consonant i: — 
statué (for tstatu-yo), -ere, to set up, from status, position. 
metud, -ere, to fear, from metus, fear. 
acué, -ere, to sharpen, from acus, needle. 
argud, -ere, to clear up, from inherited stem targu-, bright (cf. dpyupos). 
Norr.— Many verbs in u are inherited, being formed from roots in u: as, flud, 
fluere, flow ; so-lvo (for {sé-luG, cf. \dw), solvere, dissolve. Some roots haye a parasitic 
u: as, loquor, lociitus, speak. 
1 The type of all or most of the denominative formations in §§ 259-262 was inherited, 
but the process went on in the development of Latin as a separate language.

  158 FORMATION OF WORDS [s$ 262, 263 
262. Many i-verbs or verbs of the Fourth Conjugation are 
formed from i-stems : — 
milior, -iri, to toil, from mdlés (-is), mass. 
finid, -ire, to bound, from finis, end. 
sitid, -ire, to thirst, from sitis, thirst. 
stabilid, -ire, to establish, from stabilis, stable. 
a. Some arise by confusion from other stems treated as i-stems : — 
bullid, -ire, to boil, from bulla (stem bulla-), bubble. 
condi6, -ire, to preserve, from condus (stem condo-), storekeeper. 
insAni6, -ire, to rave, from insanus (stem insano-), mad. 
gestid, -ire, to show wild longing, from gestus (stem gestu-), gesture.   
  
Norr.—Some of this form are of doubtful origin: as, Grdior, begin, cf. ddd and 
exordium. The formation is closely akin to that of verbs in -id of the third conjuga- 
tion (p. 102). 
b. Some are formed with -i6 from consonant stems : — 
ciistddi6, -ire, to guard, from ciistés (stem cistéd-), guardian. 
fulguri6, -ire, to lighten, from fulgur, lightning. 
Nore. — Here probably belong the so-called desideratives in -urid (see § 263. 4. N.). 
Verbs from Other Verbs 
263. The following four classes of verbs regularly derived 
from other verbs have special meanings connected with their 
terminations. 
Nore. — These classes are all really denominative in their origin, but the forma- 
tions had become so associated with actual verbs that new derivatives were often 
formed directly from verbs without the intervention of a noun-stem. 
1. Inceptives or Inchoatives add -scd * to the present stem of verbs. 
They denote the beginning of an action and are of the Third Conjuga- 
tion.. Of some there is no simple verb in existence : — 
calé-scd, grow warm, from caled, be warm. 
laba-scd, begin to totter, from labo, totter. 
sci-scd, determine, from scid, know. 
con-cupi-scd, conceive a desire for, from cupid, desire. 
alé-scd, grow, from ald, feed. 
So ira-scor, get angry ; cf. ira-tus. 
iuvené-scd, grow young; cf. iuvenis, young man. 
mité-scd, grow mild; cf. mitis, mild. 
vespera-scit, it is getting late; cf. vesper, evening. 
1 For -scd in primary formation, see § 176. b. 1. 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
Fe ee 
§ 263] VERBS FROM OTHER VERBS 159 
Nore. — Inceptives properly haye only the present stem, but many use the perfect 
and supine systems of simple verbs: as, caléscd, grow warm, calui; ardéscd, blaze 
JSorth, arsi; proficiscor, set out, profectus. 
2. Intensives or Iteratives are formed from the Supine stem and end 
in-td or -itd (rarely-sd). They denote a forcible or repeated action, but 
this special sense often disappears. Those derived from verbs of 
the First Conjugation end in -its (not -dtd). 
iac-t0, hurl, from iacid, throw. 
dormi-to, be sleepy, from dormié, sleep. 
vol-itd, flit, from volé, fly. 
véndi-td, try to sell, from vénds, sell. 
quas-sd, shatter, from quatis, shake. 
They are of the first conjugation, and are properly denominative. 
a. Compound suffixes -titd, -sitd, are formed with a few verbs. These 
are probably derived from other Iteratives; thus, cantits may come from 
cant6, iterative of can6, sing. 
b. Another form of Intensives — sometimes called Meditatives, or verbs 
of practice— ends in -essé (rarely -issd). These denote a certain energy or 
eagerness of action rather than its repetition : — 
cap-esso, lay hold on, from capid, take. 
fac-essd, do (with energy), from facid, do. 
pet-esso, pet-issd, seek (eagerly), from pets, seek. 
These are of the third conjugation, usually having the perfect and 
supine of the fourth: — 
arcess0, arcessére, arcessivi, arcessitum, summon. 
lacessd, lacess&re, lacessivi, lacessitum, provoke. 
Norg.— The verbs in -ess6, -issd, show the same formation as levass6, impetrassere, 
iiidicdssit, etc. (§ 183. 5), but its origin is not fully explained. 
3. Diminutives end in -illd, and denote a feeble or petty action : — 
cay-illor, jest, cf. cavilla, raillery. 
cant-illd, chirp or warble, from canté, sing. 
Norr.— Diminutives are formed from verb-stems derived from real or supposed 
diminutive nouns. 
4. Desideratives end in -turid (-surid), and express longing or wish- 
ing. They are of the fourth conjugation, and only two are in com- 
mon use: 
par-turid, be in labor, from parid, bring forth. 
é-surid (for ted-turid), be hungry, from edo, eat. . 
Others are used by the dramatists. 
Nore. —Desideratives are probably derived from some noun of agency: as, émp- 
turid, wish to buy, from émptor, buyer. Visd, go to see, is an inherited desiderative of 
’ a different formation.   
     
-P-A-G-E-172
  160 FORMATION OF WORDS [S$ 264, 265 
COMPOUND WORDS 
264, A Compound Word is one whose stem is made up of two 
or more simple stems. 
a. A final stem-vowel of the first member of the compound usually dis- 
appears before a vowel, and usually takes the form of i before a consonant. 
Only the second member receives inflection. 
b. Only noun-stems can be thus compounded. A preposition, however, 
often becomes attached to a verb. 
265. New stems are formed by Composition in three ways: — 
1. The second part is simply added to the first : — 
su-ove-taurilia (sis, ovis, taurus), the sacrifice of a swine, a sheep, and a bull 
(cf. § 255. a). 
septen-decim (septem, decem), seventeen. 
2. The first part modifies the second as an adjective or adverb 
(Determinative Compounds) : — 
lati-fundium (latus, fundus), a large landed estate. 
omni-poténs (omnis, poténs), omnipotent. 
8. The first part has the force of a case, and the second a verbal 
force (Objective Compounds) : — 
agri-cola (ager, field, tcola akin to cold, cultivate), a farmer. 
armi-ger (arma, arms, tger akin to gerd, carry), armor-bearer. 
corni-cen (corni, horn, tcen akin to cand, sing), horn-blower. 
carni-fex (card, flesh, tfex akin to facid, make), executioner. 
a. Compounds of the above kinds, in which the last word is a noun, 
may become adjectives, meaning possessed of the quality denoted : — 
ali-pés (ala, wing, pés, foot), wing-footed. 
magn-animus (magnus, great, animus, soul), great-souled. 
an-ceps (amb-, at both ends, caput, head), double. 
Norr.— Many compounds of the above classes appear only in the form of some 
further derivative, the proper compound not being found in Latin. 
1 The second part generally has its usual inflection; but, as this kind of composi- 
tion is in fact older than inflection, the compounded stem sometimes has an inflection 
of its own (as, cornicen, -cinis; licifer, -feri; itidex, -dicis), from stems not occurring in 
Latin. Especially do compound adjectives in Latin take the form of i-stems: as, 
animus, exanimis; norma, abnormis (see §73). In composition, stems regularly have 
their uninflected form: as, igni-spicium, divining by fire. But in o- and 4-stems the 
final vowel of the stem appears as i-, as in 4li-pés (from 4la, stem 4la-); and i- is so 
common a termination of compounded stems, that it is often added to stems which do 
not properly haye it: as, flori-comus, flower-crowned (from flds, flr-is, and coma, hair).     
-P-A-G-E-173
  §§ 266, 267] SYNTACTIC COMPOUNDS 161 
Syntactic Compounds 
266. In many apparent compounds, complete words — not 
stems — have grown together in speech. These are not strictly 
compounds in the etymological sense. They are called Syntac- 
tie Compounds. Examples are : — 
a. Compounds of facié, facté, with an actual or formerly existing noun- 
stem confounded with a verbal stem iné. These are causative in force: 
cénsué-facid, habituate (cf. cinsué-sed, become accustomed). 
cale-facid, cale-factd, to heat (cf. calé-scd, grow warm). 
6. An adverb or noun combined with a verb: — 
bene-dicd (bene, well, dicd, speak), to bless. 
satis-facid (satis, enough, facid, do), to do enough (for). 
c. Many apparent compounds of stems : — 
fide-iubed (fide, surety, iubed, command), to give surety. ‘ 
mAn-suétus (manui, to the hand, suétus, accustomed), tame. 
Marci-por (Marci puer), slave of Marcus. 
Tuppiter (tIa, old vocative, and pater), father Jove. 
anim-adverté (animum advert), attend to, punish. 
d. A few phrases forced into the ordinary inflections of nouns :— 
pro-consul, proconsul (for pré cénsule, instead of a consul). 
trium-vir, triumvir (singular from trium virdrum). 
septen-trid, the Bear, a constellation (supposed singular of septem tridnés, 
the Seven Plough-Oxen). 
In all these cases it is to be observed that words, not stems, are united. 
267. Many syntactic compounds are formed by prefixing a 
Particle to some other part of speech. 
a. Prepositions are often prefixed to Verbs. In these compounds the 
prepositions retain their original adverbial sense : — 
a, ab, AWAY: 4-mittere, to send away. 
ad, T0, TOWARDS: af-ferre (ad-ferd), to bring. 
ante, BEFORE: ante-ferre, to prefer ; ante-cellere, to excel. 
circum, AROUND: circum-miinire, to fortify completely. 
com-, con- (cum), TOGETHER or FORCIBLY: cdn-ferre, to bring together; col- 
locare, to set firm. 
48, DOWN, UTTERLY: dé-spicere, despise ; dé-struere, destroy 
&, ex, our: ef-ferre (ec-ferd), to carry forth, uplift. 
in (with verbs), IN, ON, AGAINST: in-ferre, to bear against. 
inter, BETWEEN, TO PIECES: inter-rumpere, to interrupt. 
ob, TOWARDS, TO MEET? of-ferre, to offer ; ob-venire, to meet. 
sub, UNDER, UP FROM UNDER: sub-struere, to build beneath; sub-dicere, tolead up. 
super, UPON, OVER AND ABOVE : super-fluere, fo overflow.
-P-A-G-E-174
  162 FORMATION OF WORDS 
Nore 1.—In such compounds, however, the prepositions sometimes have their 
ordinary force as prepositions, especially ad, in, circum, trans, and govern the case of 
a noun: as, transire flimen, ¢o cross a river (see § 388. b). 
Nore 2.—Short a of the root is weakened toi before one consonant, to e before 
two: as, facid, cOnficid, cinfectus; iacid, Gicid, Giectus. But long a is retained: as, 
peractus. s 
6. Verbs are also compounded with the following inseparable particles, 
which do not appear as prepositions in Latin :— 
amb- (am-, an-), AROUND: amb-ire, to go about (cf. dul, about). 
dis-, di-, ASUNDER, APART: dis-cédere, to depart (cf. duo, two); di-vidére, to 
divide. 
por-, FORWARD: por-tendere, to hold forth, predict (cf. porré, forth). 
ted-, re-, BACK, AGAIN: red-ire, to return; re-cliidere, to open (from claudd, 
shut) ; re-ficere, to repair (make again). 
séd-, sé-, APART: sé-cernd, to separate; cf. séd-itid, a going apart, secession 
(e6, ire, to go). 
ec. Many Verbals are found compounded with a preposition, like the 
verbs to which they correspond : — 
per-fuga, deserter; cf. per-fugi 
tra-dux, vine-branch; cf. tra-dii 
ad-vena, stranger; cf. ad-venid. 
con-iux (con-iiinx), spouse; cf. con-iungs. 
in-dex, pointer out; cf. i 
prae-ses, guardian; cf. nraeiden: 
com-bibd, boon companion; cf. com-bibé, -Ere. 
    (trans-diics). 
    d. An Adjective is sometimes modified by an adverbial prefix. 
1. Of these, per- (less commonly prae-), very; sub-, somewhat ; in-, not, are 
regular, and are very freely prefixed to adjectives : — 
per-magnus, very large. in-nocuus, harmless. 
per-pauci, very few. in-imicus, unfriendly. 
sub-risticus, rather clownish. in-sanus, insane. 
sub-fuscus, darkish. in-finitus, boundless. 
prae-longus, very long. im-pirus, impure. 
Nore. —Perand sub, in these senses, arealso prefixed to verbs: as, per-terred, terrify ; 
sub-rided, smile. In igndscd, pardon, in- appears to be the negative prefix. 
2. The negative in- sometimes appears in combination with an adjective 
that does not occur alone :— 
in-ermis, unarmed (cf. arma, arms). 
im-bellis, wnwarlike (cf. bellum, war). 
im-pinis, without punishment (cf. poena, punishment). 
in-teger, untouched, whole (cf. tangs, to touch, root Tag). 
in-vitus, unwilling (probably from root seen in vi-s, thou wishest).

PART SECOND—SYNTAX 
INTRODUCTORY NOTE 
268. The study of formal grammar arose at a late period in the history of lan- 
guage, and dealt with language as a fully developed product. Accordingly the terms 
of Syntax correspond to the logical habits of thought and forms of expression that 
had grown up at such a period, and have a logical as well as a merely grammatical 
meaning. But a developed syntactical structure is not essential to the expression of 
thought. A form of words—like 6 puerum pulchrum! of! beautiful boy—expresses 
a thought and might even be called asentence; though it does not logically declare any- 
thing, and does not, strictly speaking, make what is usually called a sentence at all. 
Ata very early period of spoken language, word-forms were no doubt significant 
in themselves, without inflections, and constituted the whole of language, —just as to 
a child the name of some familiar object will stand for all he can say aboutit. Ata 
somewhat later stage, such uninflected words put side by side made a rudimentary 
form of proposition: asa child might say fire bright; horserun. With this began the 
first form of logical distinction, that of Subject and Predicate; but as yet there was no 
distinction in form between noun and verb, and no fixed distinction in function. Ata 
later stage forms were differentiated in function and— by various processes of com- 
position which cannot be fully traced —Inflections were developed. These served to 
express person, tense, case, and other grammatical relations, and we have true Parts 
of Speech. 
Not until language reached this last stage was there any fixed limit to the asso- 
ciation of words, or any rule prescribing the manner in which they should be combined. 
But gradually, by usage, particular forms came to be limited to special functions (as 
nouns, verbs, adjectives), and fixed customs arose of combining words into what we 
now call Sentences. These customs are in part the result of general laws or modes of 
thought (logic), resulting from our habits of mind (General Grammar); and in part 
are what may be called By-Laws, established by custom in a given language (Particu- 
lar Grammar), and making what is called the Syntax of that language. 
In the fully developed methods of expression to which we are almost exclusively 
accustomed, the unit of expression is the Sentence: that is, the completed statement, 
with its distinct Subject and Predicate. Originally sentences were simple. But two 
simple sentence-forms may be used together, without the grammatical subordination 
of either, to express a more complex form of thought than could be denoted by one 
alone. This is paratazis (arrangement side by side). Since, however, the two sen- 
tences, independent in form, were in fact used to express parts of a complex whole 
and were therefore mutually dependent, the sense of unity found expression in con- 
junctions, which denoted the grammatical subordination of the one to the other. This 
is hypotaxis (arrangement under, subordination). In this way, through various stages 
of development, which correspond to our habitual modes of thought, there were pro- 
duced various forms of complex sentences. Thus, to express the complex idea I beseech 
you to pardon me, the two simple sentence-forms quaesd and igndscas were used side by 
side, quaesd igndscas ; then the feeling of grammatical subordination found expression 
in a conjunction, quaesd ut ignéscds, forming a complex sentence. The results of these 
processes constitute the subject-matter of Syntax.

THE SENTENCE 
Kinds of Sentences 
269. A’ Sentence is a form of words which contains a State- 
ment, a Question, an Exclamation, or a Command. 
a. A sentence in the form of a Statement is called a Declarative 
Sentence: as, — canis currit, the dog runs. 
6. A sentence in the form of a Question is called an Interroga- 
tive Sentence: as,—canisne currit? does the dog run? 
ce. A sentence in the form of an Exclamation is called an Exclama- 
tory Sentence: as,—quam celeriter currit canis! how fast the dog runs | 
d. A sentence in the form of a Command, an Exhortation, or an 
Entreaty is called an Imperative Sentence: as,—i, curre per Alpis, go, 
run across the Alps ; currat canis, let the dog run. 
Subject and Predicate 
270. Every sentence consists of a Subject and a Predicate. 
The Subject of a sentence is the person or thing spoken of. 
The Predicate is that which is said of the Subject. 
Thus in canis currit, the dog runs, canis is the subject, and currit the predicate. 
271. The Subject of a sentence is usually a Noun or Pronoun, 
or some word or group of words used as a Noun: — 
equités ad Caesarem vénérunt, the cavalry came to Cesar. 
hiimanum est errare, to err is human. 
quaeritur num mors malum sit, the question is whether death is an evil. 
a, But in Latin the subject is often implied in the termination of 
the verb: — 
sedé-mus, we sit. curri-tis, you run. inqui-t, says he. 
272. The Predicate of a sentence may be a Verb (as in canis 
currit, the dog runs), or it may consist of some form of sum and 
a Noun or Adjective which describes or defines the subject (as in 
Caesar consul erat, Cesar was consul). 
Such a noun or adjective is called a Predicate Noun or Adjective, 
and the verb sum is called the Copula (i.e. the connective). 
Thus in the example given, Caesar is the subject, consul the predicate noun, and 
erat the copula (see § 283).
-P-A-G-E-177
  §§ 278, 274] VERB AND OBJECT 165 
Transitive and Intransitive Verbs 
273. Verbs are either Transitive or Intransitive. 
1. A Transitive Verb has or requires a direct object to complete 
its sense (see § 274): as, — fratrem cecidit, he slew his brother. 
2. An Intransitive Verb admits of no direct object to complete 
its sense: — 
cad, I fall (or am falling). 8d] licet, the sun shines (or is shining). 
Nore 1.— Among transitive verbs Factitive Verbs are sometimes distinguished 
as a separate class. These state an act which produces the thing expressed by the 
word which completes their sense. Thus ménsam fécit, he made a table (which was 
not in existence before), is distinguished from ménsam percussit, he struck a table 
(which already existed). 
Nore 2.—A transitive verb may often be used absolutely, i.e. without any object 
expressed: as, —arat, he is ploughing, where the verb does not cease to be transitive 
because the object is left indefinite, as we see by adding, — quid, what? agrum suum, 
his land. 
Nore 3.— Transitive and Intransitive Verbs are often called Active and Neuter 
Verbs respectively. 
Object 
274, The person or thing immediately affected by the action of 
a verb is called the Direct Object. 
A person or thing indirectly affected by the action of a verb 
is called the Indirect Object. 
Only transitive verbs can have a Direct Object; but an Indirect 
Object may be used with both transitive and intransitive verbs 
(§§ 362, 366) :— 
pater vocat filium (direct object), the father calls his son. 
mihi (ind. obj.) agrum (dir. obj.) ostendit, he showed me a field. 
mihi (ind, obj.) placet, it is pleasing to me. 
Nore. — The distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs is nota fixed dis- 
tinction, for most transitive verbs may be used intransitively, and many verbs usually 
intransitive may take a direct object and so become transitive (§ 388. a). 
a. With certain verbs, the Genitive, Dative, or Ablative is used 
where the English, from a difference in meaning, requires the direct 
object (Objective) : — 
hominem vided, I see the man (Accusative). 
homini servid, I serve the man (Dative, see § 367). 
hominis misereor, I pity the man (Genitive, see § 354. a). 
homine amicé titor, I treat the man as a friend (Ablative, see § 410).
-P-A-G-E-178
  166 SYNTAX: THE SENTENCE [$§ 274-277 
b. Many verbs transitive in Latin are rendered into English by 
an intransitive verb with a preposition :— 
petit aprum, he aims at the boar. 
laudem affectat, he strives after praise. 
curat valétidinem, he takes care of his health. 
meum casum doluérunt, they grieved at my misfortune. 
ridet nostram amentiam (Quinct. 55), he laughs at our stupidity. 
275. When a transitive verb is changed from the Active to the 
Passive voice, the Direct Object becomes the Subject and is. put 
in the Nominative case : — 
. Active: pater filium vocat, the father calls his son. 
Passive: filius 4 patre vocatur, the son is called by his father. 
Active; linam et stellas vidémus, we see the moon and the stars. 
Passive: lina et stellae videntur, the moon and stars are seen (appear). 
Modification 
276. A Subject or a Predicate may be modified by a single word, 
or by a group of words (a phrase or a clause). 
The modifying word or group of words may itself be modified in 
the same way. 
a. A single modifying word may be an adjective, an adverb, an 
appositive (§ 282), or the oblique case of a noun. 
Thus in the sentence vir fortis patienter fert, a brave man endures patiently, 
the adjective fortis, brave, modifies the subject vir, man, and the adverb patienter, 
patiently, modifies the predicate fert, endures. 
6. The modifying word is in some cases said to limit the word 
to which it belongs. 
Thus in the sentence pueri patrem vided, I see the boy’s father, the genitive 
pueri limits patrem (by excluding any other father). 
277. A Phrase is a group of words, without subject or predicate 
of its own, which may be used as an Adjective or an Adverb. 
Thus in the sentence vir fuit summa ndbilitate, he was a man of the highest 
nobility, the words summa ndbilitate, of the highest nobility, are used for the 
adjective nobilis, noble (or ndbilissimus, very noble), and are called an Adjective 
Phrase. 
So in the sentence magn celeritate vénit, he came with great speed, the words 
magna celeritate, with great speed, are used for the adverb celeriter, quickly (or 
celerrimé, very quickly), and are called an Adverbial Phrase, 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
§§ 278, 279] CLAUSES AND SENTENCES 167 
Clauses and Sentences 
278. Sentences are either Simple or Compound. 
1. A sentence containing a single statement is called a Simple 
Sentence. 
2. A sentence containing more than one statement is called 
a Compound Sentence, and each single statement in it is called 
a Clause. 
a. If one statement is simply added to another, the clauses are 
said to be Coérdinate. They are usually connected by a Coérdinate 
Conjunction (§ 223. a); but this is sometimes omitted : — 
divide et impera, divide and control. But, — 
véni, vidi, vici, I came, I saw, I conquered. 
b. If one statement modifies another in any way, the modifying 
clause is said to be Subordinate, and the clause modified is called 
the Main Clause. " 
This subordination is indicated by some connecting word, either 
a Subordinate Conjunction (§ 223. 6) or a Relative: — 
dderint dum metuant, let them hate so long as they fear. 
servum misit quem sécum habébat, he sent the slave whom he had with him. 
A sentence containing one or more subordinate clauses is some- 
times called Complex. 
Nors. — A subordinate clause may itself_be modified by other subordinate clauses. 
279. Subordinate Clauses are of various kinds. 
a. A clause introduced by a Relative Pronoun or Relative Adverb 
is ealled a Relative Clause : — 
Mosa prdfluit ex monte Vosego, qui est in finibus Lingonum (B. G. iv. 10), 
the Meuse rises in the Vosges mountains, which are on the borders of the 
Lingones. 
For Relative Pronouns (or Relative Adverbs) serving to connect independent sen- 
tences, see § 308. f. 
b. A clause introduced by an Adverb of Time is called a Tem- 
poral Clause : — 
cum tacent, clamant (Cat. i. 21), while they are silent, they cry aloud. 
hominés aegri morbd gravi, cum iactantur aestii febrique, si aquam gelidam 
biberint, prim6 relevari videntur (id. i. 31), men suffering with a severe 
sickness, when they are tossing with the heat of fever, if they drink cold 
water, seem at first to be relieved.  
-P-A-G-E-180
  168 SYNTAX: AGREEMENT [8§ 279-281 
ec. A clause containing a Condition, introduced by si, if (or some 
equivalent expression), is called a Conditional Clause. A sentence 
containing a conditional clause is called a Conditional Sentence. 
Thus, si aquam gelidam biberint, primd relevari videntur (in b, above) is a Con- 
ditional Sentence, and si. . biberint is a Conditional Clause. 
d, A clause expressing the Purpose of an action is called a Final 
Clause : — 
ed6 ut vivam, I eat to live (that I may live). 
mnisit légdtds qui dicerent, he sent ambassadors to say (who should say). 
e. A clause expressing the Result of an action is called a Con- 
secutive Clause : —1 
tam longé aberam ut non vidérem, I was too far away to see (so far away that 
I did not see). 
AGREEMENT 
280. A word is said to agree with another when it is required 
by usage to be in the same Gender, Number, Case, or Person. 
The following are the general forms of agreement, sometimes 
called the Four Concords: — 
1. The agreement of the Noun in Apposition or as Predicate 
($§ 281-284). 
2. The agreement of the Adjective with its Noun (§ 286). 
38. The agreement of the Relative with its Antecedent (§ 305). 
4, The agreement of the Finite Verb with its Subject (§ 316). 
a. A word sometimes takes the gender or number, not of the word 
with which it should regularly agree, but of some other word implied 
in that word. 
This use is called Synesis, or constractid ad s¢nsum (construction 
according to sense). - 
AGREEMENT OF NOUNS 
281. A noun used to deseribe another, and denoting the same 
person or thing, agrees with it in Case. 
The descriptive noun may be either an Appositive (§ 282) or a 
Predicate noun (§ 283). 
1 Observe that the classes defined in a-e are not mutually exclusive, but that a 
single clause may belong to several of them at once. Thus a relative clause is 
usually subordinate, and may be at the same time temporal or conditional; and 
subordinate clauses may be codrdinate with each other. 
 
-P-A-G-E-181
  § 282] APPOSITION 169 
Apposition 
282. A noun used to describe another, and standing in the same 
part of the sentence with the noun described, is called an Apposi- 
tive, and is said to be in apposition : — 
externus timor, maximum concordiae vinculum, iungébat animds (Liv. ii. 89), 
fear of the foreigner, the chief bond of harmony, united their hearts, 
{Here the appositive belongs to the subject.] 
quattuor hic primum dmen equds vidi (Aen. ifi. 537), I saw here four horses, 
the first omen. [Here both nouns are in the predicate. ] 
litterais Graecas senex didici (Cat. M. 26), I learned Greek when an old man. 
[Here senex, though in apposition with the subject of didici, really states 
something further: viz., the time, condition, etc., of the act (Predicate 
Apposition).] 
a. Words expressing parts may be in apposition with a word 
including the parts, or vice versa (Partitive Apposition) : — 
Nec P. Popilius neque Q. Metellus, clarissimi viri atque amplissimi, vim 
tribiniciam sustinére potuérunt (Clu. 95), neither Publius Popilius nor 
Quintus Metellus, [both of them] distinguished and honorable men, could 
withstand the power of the tribunes. 
Gnaeus et Piiblius Scipiinés, Cneius and Publius Scipio (the Scipios). 
b. An Adjective may be used as an appositive : — 
ea Sex. Roscium inopem recépit (Rosc. Am. 27), she received Sextus Roscius 
in his poverty (needy). 
ce. An appositive generally agrees with its noun in Gender and 
Number when it can: — és 
sequuntur natiram, optimam ducem (Lael. 19), they follow nature, the best 
guide. 
omnium doctrinadrum inventricés Athénis (De Or. i. 18), Athens, discoverer 
of all-learning. 
Nor. — But such agreement is often impossible: as, —dlim truncus eram ficulnus, 
initile ignum (Hor. §S. i. 8. 1), J once was a fig-tree trunk, a useless log. 
da, A common noun in apposition with a Locative (§ 427) is put in 
the Ablative, with or without the preposition in : — 
Antiochiae, celebri quondam urbe (Arch. 4), at Antioch, once a famous city. 
Albae constitérunt, in urbe miinita (Phil. iv. 6), they halted at Alba, a forti- 
fied town. 
For a Genitive in apposition with a Possessive Pronoun or an Adjective, see § 302. e. 
For the so-called Appositional Genitive, see § 343. d, 
For the construction with nomen est, see § 373. a.
-P-A-G-E-182
  170 SYNTAX: AGREEMENT [S$ 283-285 
Predicate Noun or Adjective 
283. With sum and a few other intransitive or passive verbs, a 
noun or an adjective describing or defining the subject may stand in 
the predicate. This is called a Predicate Noun or Adjective. 
The verb sum is especially common in this construction, and when 
so used is called the copula (i.e. connective). 
Other verbs which take a predicate noun or adjective are the so- 
called copulative verbs signifying to become, to be made, to be named, 
to appear, and the like. 
284. A Predicate Noun or Adjective after the copula sum or a 
copulative verb is in the same case as the Subject: — 
pacis semper auctor fui (Lig. 28), I have always been an adviser of peace. 
quae pertinacia quibusdam, eadem aliis constantia vidéri potest (Mare. 31), 
what may seem obstinacy to some, may seem to others consistency. 
éius mortis sedétis ultdrés (Mil. 79), you sit as avengers of his death. 
habeatur vir égregius Paulus (Cat. iv. 21), let Paulus be regarded as an 
extraordinary man. 
ego patronus exstiti (Rosc. Am. 5), I have come forward as an advocate. 
dicit ndn omnis bonds esse beatis, he says that not all good men are happy. 
a. A predicate noun referring to two or more singular nouns is 
in the plural :— 
cdnsulés creantur Caesar et Servilius (B. C. iii. 1), Cesar and Servilius are 
elected consuls. 
6. Sum in the sense of exist makes a complete predicate without a 
predicate noun or adjective. It is then called the substantive verb: — 
sunt viri fortés, there are (exist) brave men. [Cf. vixére fortés ante Agamem- 
nona (Hor. Od. iv. 9. 25), brave men lived before Agamemnon. ] 
For Predicate Accusative and Predicate Ablative, see §§ 392, 415. x. 
AGREEMENT OF ADJECTIVES 
Attributive and Predicate Adjectives 
285. Adjectives are either Attributive or Predicate. 
1. An Attributive Adjective simply qualifies its noun without 
the intervention of a verb or participle, expressed or implied: as, 
—pbonus imperator, a good commander; stellae licidae, bright stars; 
verbum Graecum, a Greek word.
-P-A-G-E-183
  §§ 285, 286] AGREEMENT OF ADJECTIVES 171 
2. All other adjectives are called Predicate Adjectives: — 
stellae licidae erant, the stars were bright. 
sit Scipid clarus (Cat. iv. 21), let Scipio be illustrious. 
hominés mitis reddidit (Inv. i. 2), has rendered men mild. 
tria praedia Capitdni propria traduntur (Rosc. Am. 21), three farms are 
handed over to Capito as his own. 
consilium cépérunt plénum sceleris (id. 28), they formed a plan full of 
villany. 
Norr.— A predicate adjective may be used with sum or a copulative verb (§ 283) ; it 
may have the construction of a predicate accusative after a verb of naming, calling, or 
the like (§ 393. N.); or it may be used in apposition like a noun (§ 282. 8). 
Rules of Agreement 
286. Adjectives, Adjective Pronouns, and Participles agree 
with their nouns in Gender, Number, and Case : — 
vir fortis, a brave man. 
illa mulier, that woman. 
urbium magnarum, of great cities. 
cum ducentis militibus, with two hundred soldiers. 
imperator victus est, the general was beaten. 
seciitae sunt tempestatés, storms followed. 
Nors. — All rules for the agreement of adjectives apply also to adjective pronouns 
and to participles. 
a. With two or more nouns the adjective is regularly plural, but 
often agrees with the nearest (especially when attributive) : — 
Nisus et Euryalus primi (Aen. v. 294), Nisus and Euryalus first. 
Caesaris omni et gratia et opibus fruor (Fam. i. 9. 21), IT enjoy all Cesar’s favor 
and resources. 
Norr. — An adjective referring to two nouns connected by the preposition cum is 
occasionally plural (synesis, § 280. a): as, —Iuba cum Labién6 capti (B. Afr. 52), Juba 
and Labienus were taken. 
b. A collective noun may take an adjective of a different gender 
and number agreeing with the gender and number of the individuals 
implied (synesis, § 280. a): — 
pars certire parati (Aen. v. 108), a part ready to contend. 
coloniae aliquot déductae, Prisci Latini appellati (Liv. i. 3), several colonies 
were planted (led out) [of men] called Old Latins. 3 
multitidd convicti sunt (Tac. Ann. xv. 44), a multitude were convicted. 
magna pars raptae (id. i. 9), a large part [of the women] were seized. 
Norr. — A superlative in the predicate rarely takes the gender of a partitive geni- 
tive by which it is limited: as,— vélécissimum animalium delphinus est (Plin. N. H. 
ix. 20), the dolphin is the swiftest [creature] of creatures.  
-P-A-G-E-184
  172 SYNTAX: ADJECTIVES [$§ 287, 288 
287. One adjective may belong in sense to two or more nouns 
of different genders. In such cases, — 
1. An Attributive Adjective agrees with the nearest noun :— 
multae operae ac laboris, of much trouble and toil. 
vita morésque mei, my life and character. 
si rés, si vir, si tempus illum dignum fuit (Mil. 19), if any thing, if any 
man, if any time was jit. 
2. A Predicate Adjective may agree with the nearest noun, if the 
nouns form one connected idea : — 
factus est strepitus et admurmurati6 (Verr. i. 45), a noise of assent was made 
(noise and murmur). 
Norx. — This is only when the copula agrees with the nearest subject (§ 317. ¢). 
3. But generally, a Predicate Adjective will be masculine, if nouns 
of different genders mean living beings; neuter, if things without 
life: — 
uxor deinde ac liberi amplexi (Liv. ii. 40), then his wife and children embraced 
him. 
labor (m.) voluptasque (¥.) societate quadam inter sé natiirali sunt idncta (N.) 
(id. v. 4), labor and delight are bound together by a certain natural alli- 
ance. 
4. If nouns of different genders include both living beings and 
things without life, a Predicate Adjective is sometimes masculine (or 
feminine), sometimes neuter, and sometimes agrees in gender with 
the nearest if that is plural : — 
réx régiaque classis tina profecti (Liv. xxi. 50), the king and the royal fleet set 
out together. 
and a king are hostile. 
légatds sortésque Sraculi exspectandas (id. v. 15), that the ambassadors and 
the replies of the oracle should be waited for. 
a. Two or more abstract nouns of the same gender may have a 
Predicate Adjective in the neuter plural (cf. § 289. c): — 
stultitia et temeritas et initistitia . . . sunt fugienda (Fin. iii. 89), folly, rash- 
ness, and injustice are [things] to be shunned. 
Adjectives used Substantively 
288. Adjectives are often used as Nouns (substantively), the 
masculine usually to denote men or people in general of that kind, 
the feminine women, and the neuter things : —
-P-A-G-E-185
  §§ 288, 289] ADJECTIVES USED SUBSTANTIVELY 178 
omnés, all men (everybody). omnia, all things (everything). 
maidrés, ancestors. minérés, descendants. 
Romani, Romans. barbari, barbarians. 
liberta, a freedwoman. Sabinae, the Sabine wives. 
sapiéns, a sage (philosopher). amicus, a friend. 
boni, the good (good people). bona, goods, property. 
Nore. — The plural of adjectives, pronouns, and participles is very common in this 
use. The singular is comparatively rare except in the neuter (§ 289. a, c) and in words 
that have become practically nouns. 
a. Certain adjectives have become practically nouns, and are often 
modified by other adjectives or by the possessive genitive ; — 
tuus vicinus proximus, your next-door neighbor. 
propinqui céteri, his other relatives. 
meus aequalis, a man of my own age. 
éius familiaris Catilina (Har. Resp. 5), his intimate friend Catiline. 
Leptae nostri familiarissimus (Fam. ix. 138. 2), a very close friend of our friend 
Lepia. 
b. When ambiguity would arise from the substantive use of an 
adjective, a noun must be added : — 
poni, the good; omnia, everything (all things) ; but, — 
potentia omnium rérum, power over everything. 
ce. Many adjectives are used substantively either in the singular 
or the plural, with the added meaning of some noun which is under- 
stood from constant association : — 
Africus [ventus], the southwest wind; lanuarius [ménsis], January; vitu- 
lina [card], veal (calf’s flesh) ; fera [béstia], a wild beast ; patria [terra], 
the fatherland ; Gallia [terra], Gaul (the land of the Galli); hiberna 
[castra], winter quarters ; trirémis [névis], a three-banked galley, trireme ; 
argentarius [faber], @ silversmith; régia [domus], the palace; Latinae 
[fériae], the Latin festival. 
Nore. — These adjectives are specific in meaning, not generic like those in § 288. 
They include the names of winds and months (§ 31). 
For Nouns used as Adjectives, see § 321. ¢. 
For Adverbs used like Adjectives, see § 321... 
289. Neuter Adjectives are used substantively in the following 
special senses : — 
a. The neuter singular may denote either a single object or an 
abstract quality : — 
rapté vivere, to live by plunder. in arid6, on dry ground. 
honestum, an honorable act, or virtue (as a quality). 
opus est matirato, there is need of haste. [Cf. impersonal passives, § 208, d.] 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  i74 SYNTAX: ADJECTIVES [§§ 289-291 
b. The neuter plural is used to signify objects in general having 
the quality denoted, and hence may stand for the abstract idea : — 
honesta, honorable deeds (in general). _ praeterita, the past (lit., bygones). 
omnés fortia laudant, all men praise bravery (brave things). 
c. A neuter adjective may be used as an appositive or predicate 
noun with a noun of different gender (cf. § 287. a) :— 
triste lupus stabulis (Ecl. iii. 80), the wolf [is] @ grievous thing for the fold. 
varium et mitabile semper fémina (Aen. iv. 569), woman is ever a changing 
and fickle thing. 
malum mihi vidétur esse mors (Tusc. i. 9), death seems to me to be an evil. 
d. A neuter adjective may be used as an attributive or a predicate 
adjective with an infinitive or a substantive clause : — 
istuc ipsum non esse (Tusc. i. 12), that very ‘‘ not to be.” 
himanum est errare, to err is human. 
aliud est errare Caesarem ndlle, aliud ndlle miseréri (Lig. 16), it is one thing 
to be unwilling that Casar should err, another to be unwilling that he 
should pity. 
Adjectives with Adverbial Force 
290. An adjective, agreeing with the subject or object, is often 
used to qualify the action of the verb, and so has the force of an 
adverb : — 
primus vénit, he was the first to come (came first). 
nillus dubitd, I no way doubt. 
laeti audiére, they were glad to hear. 
erat Romae frequéns (Rosc. Am. 16), he was often at Rome. 
sérus in caelum redeas (Hor. Od. i. 2. 45), mayst thou return late to heaven. 
Comparatives and Superlatives 
291. Besides their regular signification (as in English), the 
forms of comparison are used as follows: — 
a. The Comparative denotes a considerable or excessive degree of 
a quality: as,— brevior, rather short ; audacior, too bold. 
b. The Superlative (of eminence) often denotes a very high degree 
of a quality without implying a distinct comparison: as, — méns 
altissimus, a very high mountain. 
Nor. — The Superlative of Eminence is much used in complimentary references 
to persons and may often be translated by the simple positive.

§§ 291-293] COMPARATIVES AND SUPERLATIVES 175 
c. With quam, vel, or inus the Superlative denotes the highest pos- 
sible degree : — 
quam plirimi, as many as possible. 
quam maximé potest (maximé quam potest), as much as can be. 
vel minimus, the very least. 
vir tinus doctissimus, the one most learned man. 
Nore 1.— A high degree of a quality is also denoted by such adverbs as admodum, 
valdé, very, or by per or prae in composition (§ 267. d. 1): as, — valdé malus, very bad = 
pessimus; perma4gnus, very great; praealtus, very high (or deep). 
Nore 2.— A low degree of a quality is indicated by sub in composition: as, —sub- 
risticus, rather clownish, or by minus, not very ; minimé, not at all; parum, not enough ; 
non satis, not much. 
Nore 3.—The comparative maidrés (for maidrés nati, greater by birth) has the spe- 
cial signification of ancestors; so mindrés often means descendants. 
For the Superlative with quisque, see § 313. b. For the construction of a substantive 
after a Comparative, see §§ 406, 407; for that of a clause, see § 535. c, 571. a. For the 
Ablative of Degree of Difference with a Comparative (multé etc.), see § 414. 
292. When two qualities of an object are compared, both adjec- 
tives are in the Comparative : — 
longior quam latior aciés erat (Liv. xxvii. 48), the line was longer than it was 
broad (or, rather long than broad). 
vérior quam gratior (id. xxii. 38), more true than agreeable. 
Norr.—So also with adverbs: as,—libentius quam vérius (Mil. 78), with more 
Sreedom than truth. 
a. Where magis is used, both adjectives are in the positive : — 
disertus magis quam sapiéns (Att. x. 1. 4), eloquent rather than wise. 
clari magis quam honesti (Iug. 8), more renowned than honorable. 
Norr.— A comparative and a positive, or even two positives, are sometimes con- 
nected by quam. This use is rarer and less elegant than those before noticed : — 
claris mAidribus quam vetustis (Tac. Ann. iv. 61), of a family more famous than 
old. 
vehementius quam cauté (Tac. Agr. 4), with more fury than good heed. 
293, Superlatives (and more rarely Comparatives) denoting 
order and succession —also medius, [c&terus], reliquus — usually 
designate not what object, but what part of a, is meant: — 
summus mons, the top of the hill. 
in ultima plated, at the end of the place. 
prior Actid, the earlier part of an action. 
reliqui captivi, the rest of the prisoners. 
in colle medid (B. G. i. 24), half way up the hill (on the middle of the hill). 
inter céteram planitiem (Iug. 92), in a region elsewhere level. 
Norr.— A similar use is found in séra (multa) nocte, date at night, and thelike. But 
medium viae, the middle of the way ; multum diéi, much of the day, also occur,

  176 SYNTAX: PRONOUNS [§§ 294, 295 
PRONOUNS 
294. A Pronoun indicates some person or thing without either naming or deserib- 
ingit. Pronounsare derived from a distinct class of roots, which seem to have denoted 
only ideas of place and direction (§ 228. 2), and from which nouns or verbs can very 
rarely be formed. They may therefore stand for Nouns when the person or thing, 
being already present to the senses or imagination, needs only to be pointed out, not 
named. 
Some pronouns indicate the object in itself, without reference to its class, and have 
no distinction of gender. These are Personal Pronouns, They stand syntactically 
for Nouns, and have the same construction as nouns. 
Other pronouns designate a particular object of a class, and take the gender of the 
individuals of that class. These are called Adjective Pronouns, They stand for 
Adjectives, and have the same construction as adjectives. 
Others are used in both ways; and, though called adjective pronouns, may also be 
treated as personal, taking, however, the gender of the object indicated. 
In accordance with their meanings and uses, Pronouns are classified as follows: — 
Personal Pronouns (§ 295). Interrogative Pronouns (§ 333). 
Demonstrative Pronouns (§ 296). Relative Pronouns (§ 303). 
Reflexive Pronouns (§ 299). Indefinite Pronouns (§ 309). 
Possessive Pronouns (§ 302). 
Personal Pronouns 
295. The Personal Pronouns have, in general, the same con- 
structions as nouns. 
a. The personal pronouns are not expressed as subjects, except for 
distinction or emphasis : — 
té vocd, I call you. But, — 
quis mé vocat ? ego té vocd, who is calling me? I (emphatic) am calling you. 
b. The personal pronouns have two forms for the genitive plural, 
that in -um being used partitively (§ 346), and that in -i oftenest 
objectively (§ 348): — 
maior vestrum, the elder of you. 
habétis ducem memorem vestri, oblitum sui (Cat. iv. 19), you have a leader 
who thinks (is mindful) of you and forgets (is forgetful of) himself. 
pars nostrum, @ part (i.e. some) of us. 
Nore 1.— The genitives nostrum, vestrum, are occasionally used objectively (§ 348): 
as, —cupidus vestrum (Verr. iii. 224), fond of you ; ciistés vestrum (Cat. iii. 29), the guar- 
dian of you (your guardian). 
Nore 2.— “One of themselves” is expressed by iinus ex suis or ipsis (rarely ex sé), 
or inus sudrum, 
c. The Latin has no personal pronouns of the third person except 
the reflexive sé. The want is supplied by a Demonstrative or Rela- 
tive ($§ 296. 2, 308. f).
-P-A-G-E-189
  §§ 296, 297] DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS 177 
Demonstrative Pronouns 
296. Demonstrative Pronouns are used either adjectively or 
substantively. 
1. As adjectives, they follow the rules for the agreement of adjec- 
tives and are called Adjective Pronouns or Pronominal Adjectives 
(§§ 286, 287): — 
hic proelié facts, after this battle was fought (this battle having been fought). 
eddem proelid, in the same battle. 
ex eis aedificiis, out of those buildings. 
2. Assubstantives, they are equivalent to personal pronouns. This 
use is regular in the oblique cases, especially of is : — 
Caesar et exercitus éius, Cwsar and his army (not suus). [But, Caesar 
exercitum suum dimisit, Cesar disbanded his [own] army.] 
si obsidés ab eis dentur (B. G. i. 14), if hostages should be given by them 
(persons just spoken of). 
. hi sunt extra provinciam trans Rhodanum primi (id. i. 10), they (those just 
mentioned) are the first [inhabitants] across the Rhone. 
ille minimum propter aduléscentiam poterat (id. i. 20), he (emphatic) had 
very little power, on account of his youth. 
a. An adjective pronoun usually agrees with an appositive or 
predicate noun, if there be one, rather than with the word to which 
it refers (cf. § 306): — 
, hic locus est inus qué perfugiant; hic portus, haec arx, haec ara socidrum 
(Verr. v. 126), this is the only place to which they can flee for refuge; this 
is the haven, this the citadel, this the altar of the allies. 
rérum caput hic erat, hic fons (Hor. Ep. i. 17. 45), this was the head of things, 
this the source. 
eam sapientiam interpretantur quam adhic mortalis némd est cdnseciitus 
[for id. . . quod] (Lael. 18), they explain that [thing] to be wisdom which 
no man ever yet attained. 
297. The main uses of hic, ille, iste, and is are the following: — 
a. Hic is used of what is near the speaker (in time, place, or 
thought). It is hence called the demonstrative of the first person. 
It is sometimes used of the speaker himself; sometimes for “the 
latter” of two persons or things mentioned in speech or writing; 
more rarely for “the former,” when that, though more remote on the 
written page, is nearer the speaker in time, place, or thought. Often 
it refers to that which has just been mentioned.
-P-A-G-E-190
  178 SYNTAX: PRONOUNS [s§ 297, 298 
6. Ie is used of what is remote (in time, etc.); and is hence called 
the demonstrative of the third person. 
It is sometimes used to mean “the former”; also (usually follow- 
ing its noun) of what is famous or well-known ; often (especially the 
neuter illud) to mean “ the following.” 
ec. Iste is used of what is between the two others in remoteness: 
often in allusion to the person addressed, —hence called the demon- 
strative of the second person. 
It especially refers to one’s opponent (in court, etc.), and fre- 
quently implies antagonism or contempt. 
d. Is is a weaker demonstrative than the others and is especially 
common asa personal pronoun. It does not denote any special object, 
but refers to one just mentioned, or to be afterwards explained by a 
relative. Often it is merely a correlative to the relative qui: — 
vénit mihi obviam tuus puer, is mihi litterds abs té reddidit (Att. ii. 1. 1), 
your boy met me, he delivered to me a letter from you. 
eum quem, one whom. _ 
eum consulem qui nén dubitet (Cat. iv. 24), @ consul who will not hesitate. 
e. The pronouns hic, ille, and is are used to point in either direction, 
back to something just mentioned or forward to something about to 
be mentioned. 
The neuter forms often refer to a clause, phrase, or idea : — 
est illud quidem vel maximum, animum vidére (Tuse. i. 52), that is in truth 
a very great thing, —to see the soul. 
f. The demonstratives are sometimes used as pronouns of refer- 
ence, to indicate with emphasis a noun or phrase just mentioned : — 
nillam virtiis aliam mercédem désiderat praeter hanc laudis (Arch. 28), 
virtue wants no other reward except that [just mentioned] of praise. 
Norr.—But the ordinary English use of that of is hardly known in Latin. Com- 
monly the genitive construction is continued without a pronoun, or some other con- 
struction is preferred : — 
cum ei Simdnidés artem memoriae pollicérétur: oblividnis, inquit, mallem (Fin. ii. 
104), when Simonides promised him the art of memory, ‘‘I should prefer,” 
said he, ‘‘[that] of forgetfulness.”” 
Caesaris exercitus Pompéianés ad Pharsalum vicit, the army of Cesar defeated 
that of Pompey (the Pompeians) at Pharsalus. 
298. The main uses of idem and ipse are as follows : — 
a. When a quality or act is ascribed with emphasis to a person 
or thing already named, is or idem (often with the concessive quidem) 
is used to indicate that person or thing : — 
 
-P-A-G-E-191
§ 298] DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS 1's 
per inum servum et eum ex gladiatorid lidé (Att. i. 16. 5), by means of a 
single slave, and that too one from the gladiatorial school. 
vincula, et ea sempiterna (Cat. iv. 7), imprisonment, and that perpetual. 
Ti. Gracchus régnum occupare cénatus est, vel régnavit is quidem paucds 
ménsis (Lael. 41), Tiberius Gracchus tried to usurp royal power, or 
rather he actually reigned a few months. 
Norsr. — So rarely with ille: as, —nunc dextra ingeminans ictiis, nunc ille sinistra 
(Aen. v. 457), now dealing redoubled blows with his right hand, now (he) with his left. 
[In imitation of the Homeric ye: ef. Aen. y. 334; ix. 796.] 
b. Idem, the same, is often used where the English requires an 
adverb or adverbial phrase (also, too, yet, at the same time):— 
oratid splendida et grandis et eadem in primis facéta (Brut. 273), an oration, 
brilliant, able, and very witty too. 
cum [haec] dicat, negat idem esse in Ded gratiam (N. D. i. 121), when he 
says this, he denies also that there is mercy with God (he, the same man). 
Norn. — This is really the same use as in a above, but in this case the pronoun 
cannot be represented by a pronoun in English. 
c. The intensive ipse, se//, is used with any of the other pronouns, 
with a noun, or with a temporal adverb for the sake of emphasis : — 
turpe mihi ipsi vidébatur (Phil. i. 9), even to me (to me myself) it seemed 
disgraceful. 
id ipsum, that very thing; quod ipsum, which of itself alone. 
in eum ipsum locum, to that very place. 
tum ipsum (Off. ii. 60), at that very time. 
Norr 1.— The emphasis of ipse is often expressed in English by just, very, mere, etc. 
Nor 2.—In English, the pronouns himself ete. are used both intensively (as, he 
will come himself) and reflexively (as, he will kill himself): in Latin the former would 
be translated by ipse, the latter by sé or sésé. 
d. Ipse is often used alone, substantively, as follows : — 
1. As an emphatic pronoun of the third person :— 
idque rei piblicae praeclarum, ipsis gléridsum (Phil. ii. 27), and this was 
splendid for the state, glorious for themselves. 
omnés boni quantum in ipsis fuit (id. ii. 29), all good men so far as was in 
their power (in themselves). 
di capiti ipsius generique reservent (Aen. viii. 484), may the gods hold in 
reserve [such a fate] to fall on his own and his son-in-law’s head. 
2. To emphasize an omitted subject of the first or second person : — 
yobiscum ipsi recordamini (Phil. ii. 1), remember in your own minds (your- 
selves with yourselves). 
3. To distinguish the principal personage from subordinate persons : — 
ipse dixit (cf. avrds 2a), he (the Master) said it. 
Nomentanus erat super ipsum (Hor. §. ii. 8. 28), Nomentanus was above [the 
host] himself [at table].  
-P-A-G-E-192
  180 SYNTAX: PRONOUNS [$$ 298-800 
e. Ipse is often (is rarely) used instead of a reflexive (see § 300. d). 
f. Ipse usually agrees with the subject, even when the real empha- 
sis in English is on a reflexive in the predicate : — 
mé ipse cOnsdlor (Lael. 10), I console myself. [Not mé ipsum, as the Eng- 
lish would lead us to expect.] 
Reflexive Pronouns 
299. The Reflexive Pronoun (sé), and usually its corresponding 
possessive (suus), are used in the predicate to refer to the subject 
of the sentence or clause : — 
sé ex navi proiécit (B. G. iv. 25), he threw himself from the ship. 
Dumnorigem ad sé vocat (id. i. 20), he calls Dumnorix to him. 
sésé castris tenébant (id. iii. 24), they kept themselves in camp. 
contemni sé putant (Cat. M. 65), they think they are despised. 
Caesar suas copias subdicit (B. G. i. 22), Caesar leads up his troops. 
Caesar statuit sibi Rhénum esse trinseundum (id. iv. 16), Cwsar decided that 
he mus cross the Rhine (the Rhine must be crossed by himself). 
a, For reflexives of the first and second persons the oblique cases 
of the personal pronouns (mei, tui, etc.) and the corresponding pos- 
sessives (meus, tuus, etc.) are used : — 
morti mé obtuli (Mil. 94), I have exposed myself to death. 
hine té réginae ad limina perfer (Aen. i. 889), do you go (bear yourself) 
hence to the queen’s threshold. 
quid est quod tantis nds in labdribus exerceimus (Arch. 28), what reason is 
there why we should exert ourselves in so great toils ? 
singulis vébis novénds ex turmis manipulisque vestri similés é@ligite (Liv. 
xxi. 54), for each of you pick out from the squadrons and maniples nine 
like yourselves. 
300. In a subordinate clause of a complex sentence there is a 
double use of Reflexives. 
1. The reflexive may always be used to refer to the subject of its 
own clause (Direct Reflexive): — 
itidicari potest quantum habeat in sé boni cdnstantia (B. G. i. 40), it can be 
determined how much good firmness possesses (has in itself). 
[Caesar] ndluit eum locum vacare, né Germani é suis finibus transirent 
(id. i. 28), Caesar did not wish this place to lie vacant, for fear the Ger- 
mans would cross over from their territories. 
si qua significatid virtiitis Gliceat ad quam sé similis animus adplicet et 
adiungat (Lael. 48), if any sign of virtue shine forth to which a similar 
disposition may attach itself.
-P-A-G-E-193
$300], REFLEXIVE PRONOUNS 181 
2. If the subordinate clause expresses the words or thought of the 
subject of the main clause, the reflexive is regularly used to refer to 
that subject (Indirect Reflexive) : — 
petiérunt ut sibi licéret (B. G. i. 30), they begged that it might be allowed 
them (the petitioners). 
Iccius nintium mittit, nisi subsidium sibi submittatur (id. ii. 6), Iccius sends 
a message that unless relief be furnished him, etc. 
decima legié ei gratias égit, quod dé sé optimum itidicium fécisset (id. i. 41), 
the tenth legion thanked him because [they said] he had expressed a high 
opinion of them. 
si obsidés ab eis (the Helvetians) sibi (Cesar, who is the speaker) dentur, sé 
(Cesar) cum eis pacem esse facttirum (id. i. 14), [Cesar said that] if 
hostages were given him by them he would make peace with them. 
Norr.— Sometimes the person or thing to which the reflexive refers is not the 
grammatical subject of the main clause, though it is in effect the subject of discourse: 
Thus, —cum ipsi ded nihil minus gratum futiirum sit quam ndn omnibus patére ad sé 
placandum viam (Legg. ii. 25), since to God himself nothing will be less pleasing than 
that the way to appease him should not be open to all men. 
a. If the subordinate clause does not express the words or thought 
of the main subject, the reflexive is not regularly used, though it is 
occasionally found : — 
sunt ita multi ut_eds carcer capere-nén possit (Cat. ii. 22), they are so many 
that the prison cannot-hold them. [Here sé could not be used ; so also 
in the example following. ] 
ibi in proximis villis ita bipartitd fuérunt, ut Tiberis inter eds et pons inter- 
esset (id. iii. 5), there they stationed themselves in the nearest farm- 
houses, in two divisions, in such a manner that the Tiber and the bridge 
were between them (the divisions). 
non fuit ed contentus quod ei praeter spem acciderat (Manil. 25), he was not 
content with that which had happened to him beyond his hope. 
Compare: qui fit, Maecénas, ut ném6, quam sibi sortem seu ratio dederit 
seu fors obiécerit, illa contentus vivat (Hor. S. i. 1. 1), how comes it, 
Mecenas, that nobody lives contented with that lot which choice has 
assigned him or chance has thrown in his way? [Here sibi is used to 
put the thought into the mind of the discontented man. ] 
      
      
  b. Ipse is often (is rarely) used instead of an indirect reflexive, 
either to avoid ambiguity or from carelessness; and in later writers 
is sometimes found instead of the direct reflexive : — 
cir dé sua virtiite aut dé ipsius diligentia déspérarent (B. G. i. 40), why 
(he asked) should they despair of their own courage or his diligence ? 
omnia aut ipsés aut hostés populatés (Q. C. iii. 5. 6), [they said that] either 
they themselves or the enemy had laid all waste. [Direct reflexive. ]

worshipped with annual rites among them was taken away. [Here Cicero 
wavers between apud eds colébatur, a remark of his own, and apud sé 
colerétur, the words of the ambassadors. eds does not strictly refer to 
the ambassadors, but to the people—the Tyndaritani.] 
301. Special uses of the Reflexive are the following : — 
a. The reflexive in a subordinate clause sometimes refers to the 
subject of a suppressed main clause : — 
Paetus omnis librds qués frater suus reliquisset mihi donavit (Att. ii. 1), 
Petus gave me all the books which (as he said in the act of donation) 
his brother had left him. 
b. The reflexive may refer to any noun or pronoun in its own clause 
which is so emphasized as to become the subject of discourse: — 
Sdcratem civés sui interfécérunt, Socrates was put to death by his own fellow- 
citizens. 
qui poterat saliis sua cuiquam n6n probari (Mil. 81), how can any one fail 
4 to approve his own safety? [In this and the preceding example the 
emphasis is preserved in English by the change of voice.] 
hunc siseciiti erunt sui comités (Cat. ii, 10), this man, if his companions 
follow him. 
Nors. — Occasionally the clause to which the reflexive really belongs is absorbed: 
as, — stided sinare sibi ipsos (Cat. ii, 17), Tam anxious to cure these men for their own 
benejit (i.e. ut sani r sibi | sint). 
e. Suus is used for one’s own as emphatically opposed to that of 
others, in any part of the sentence and with reference to any word 
in it:— 
suis flammis déléte Fidénas (Liv. iv. 33), destroy Fidene with its own fires 
(the fires kindled by that city, figuratively). [Cf. Cat. i. 32.] 
d, The reflexive may depend upon a verbal noun or adjective: — 
sui laus, self-praise. 
habétis ducem_memorem vestri, oblitum sui (Cat. iv. 19), you have a leader 
mindful of you, forgetful of himself. 
perditi hominés cum sui similibus servis (Phil. i. 5), abandoned men with 
slaves like themselves. 
 
-P-A-G-E-195
  §§ 301, 302] POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS 183 
e. The reflexive may refer to the subject implied in an infinitive 
or verbal abstract used indefinitely : — 
contentum suis rébus esse maximae sunt divitiae (Par. 51), the OTe 
wealth is to be content with one’s own. 
cui proposita sit conservatis sui (Fin. v. 87), one whose aim is self-preservation. 
f. Inter sé (nds, vis), among themselves (ourselves, yourselves), is 
regularly used to express reciprocal action or relation : — 
inter sé confligunt (Cat. i. 25), contend with each other. 
inter sé continentur (Arch. 2), are joined to each other. 
Possessive Pronouns 
302. The Possessive Pronouns are derivative adjectives, which 
take the gender, number, and case of the noun to which they’ 
belong, not those of the possessor : — 
haec drndmenta sunt mea (Val. iv. 4), these are my jewels. [mea is neuter 
plural, though the speaker is a woman. ] 
mei sunt drdinés, mea discriptid (Cat. M. 59), mine are the rows, mine the 
arrangement. [mea is feminine, though the speaker is Cyrus. ] 
multa in nostré collégid praeclara (id. 64), [there are] many fine things in 
our college. [nostrd is neuter singular, though men are referred to.] 
Germani suas c6pias castris édixérunt (B. G. i. 51), the Germans led their 
troops out of the camp. 
a. To express possession and similar ideas the possessive pro- 
nouns are regularly used, not the genitive of the personal or reflexive 
pronouns (§ 343. a): — 
domus mea, my house. [Not domus mei. ] 
pater noster, owr father. [Not pater nostri. ] 
patrimonium tuum, your inheritance. [Not tui.] 
Nore 1.— Exceptions are rare in classic Latin, common in later writers. For 
the use of a possessive pronoun instead of an Objective Genitive, see § 348. a. 
Norr 2.— The Interrogative Possessive ciius, -a, -um, occurs in poetry and early 
Latin: as, —cdium pecus (Eel. iii. 1), whose flock? The genitive chius is generally used 
instead. 
b. The possessives have often the acquired meaning of peculiar to, 
favorable or propitious towards, the person or thing spoken of : — 
[petere] ut sua clémentia ac mansuétidine itatur (B. G. ii. 14), they asked 
(they said) that he would show his [wonted] clemency and humanity. 
igndranti quem portum petat nillus suus ventus est (Sen. Ep. 71. 3), to 
him who knows not what port he is bound to, no wind is fair (his own). 
tempore tud pignasti (Liv. xxxviii. 45. 10), did you fight at a fit time? 
Nore. — This use is merely a natural development of the meaning of the possess- 
ive, and the pronoun may often be rendered literally.
-P-A-G-E-196
  184 SYNTAX: PRONOUNS . [§§ 802, 803 
c. The possessives are regularly omitted (like other pronouns) 
when they are plainly implied in the context : — 
socium fraudavit, he cheated his partner. [socium suum would be distinctive, 
his partner (and not another's) ; suumsocium, emphatic, his own partner. ] 
d. Possessive pronouns and adjectives implying possession are 
often used substantively to denote some special class or relation : — 
nostri, our countrymen, or men of our party. 
suds continébat (B. G. i. 15), he held his men in check. 
flamma extréma meérum (Aen. ii. 431), last flames of my countrymen. 
Sullani, the veterans of Sulla’s army; Pompéiani, the partisans of Pompey. 
Nots. — There is no reason to suppose an ellipsis here. The adjective becomes 
a noun like other adjectives (see § 288). 
e. A possessive pronoun or an adjective implying possession may 
take an appositive in the genitive case agreeing in gender, number, 
and case with an implied noun or pronoun : — 
mea sdlius causa (Ter. Heaut. 129), for my sake only. 
in nostrd omnium fléti (Mil. 92), amid the tears of us all. 
ex Anniana Mildnis dom6 (Att. iv. 3. 8), owt of Annius Milo’s house. [Equiva- 
lent to ex Anni Mildnis dom6. ] 
nostra omnium patria, the country of us all. 
suum ipsius régnum, his own kingdom. 
For the special reflexive use of the possessive suus, see §§ 299, 300. 
Relative Pronouns 
303. A Relative Pronoun agrees with some word expressed or implied either in 
its own clause, or (often) in the antecedent (demonstrative) clause. In the fullest con- 
struction the antecedent is expressed in both clauses, with more commonly a corre- 
sponding demonstrative to which the relative refers: as, — iter in ea loca facere coepit, 
quibus in locis esse Germainés audiébat (B. G. iv. 7), he began to march into those 
PLACES in which PLAcuS he heard the Germans were. But one of these nouns is com- 
monly omitted. 
The antecedent is in Latin very frequently (rarely in English) found in the relative 
clause, but more commonly in the antecedent clause. 
Thus relatives serve two uses at the same time: — 
1. As Nouns (or Adjectives) in their own clause: as,—ei qui Alesiae obsidébantur 
(B. G. vii. 77), those who were besieged at Alesia. 
2. As Connectives: as,—T. Balventius, qui superidre annd primum pilum diixerat 
(id. v. 35), Titus Balventius, who the year before had been a centurion of the first rank. 
‘When the antecedent is in a different sentence, the relative is often equivalent 
to a demonstrative with a conjunction: as,—quae cum ita sint (=et cum ea ita sint), 
[and] since this is so. 
The subordinating force did not belong to the relative originally, but was developed 
from an interrogative or indefinite meaning specialized by use. But the subordinat- 
ing and the later connective force were acquired by qui at such an early period that 
the steps of the process cannot now be traced.

  §§ 804-806] RELATIVE PRONOUNS 185 
304. A Relative Pronoun indicates a relation between its own 
clause and some substantive. This substantive is called the Ante- 
cedent of the relative. 
Thus, in the sentence — 
eum nihil délectabat quod fas esset (Mil. 43), nothing pleased him which was 
right, 
the relative quod connects its antecedent nihil with the predicate fas 
esset, indicating a relation between the two. 
305. A Relative agrees with its Antecedent in Gender and 
Number; but its Case depends on its construction in the clause 
in which it stands : — 
ea diés quam cOnstituerat vénit (B. G. i. 8), that day which he had appointed 
came. 
pontem qui erat ad Genavam iubet rescindi (id. i. 7), he orders the bridge 
which was near Geneva to be cut down. 
Aduatuci, dé quibus supra diximus, domum revertérunt (id. ii. 29), the 
Aduatuci, of whom we have spoken above, returned home. 
Norr.—This rule applies to all relative words so far as they are variable in form: 
as, qualis, quantus, quicumque, etc. 
a. If a relative has two or more antecedents, it follows the rules 
for the agreement of predicate adjectives ($§ 286, 287) : — 
filium et filiam, quis valdé diléxit, und tempore amisit, he lost at the same 
time a son and a daughter whom he dearly loved. 
grandés nati matrés et parvuli liberi, quérum utrdrumque aetas misericor- 
diam nostram requirit (Verr. v. 129), aged matrons and little children, 
whose time of life in each case demands our compassion. 
dtium atque divitiae, quae prima mortalés putant (Sall. Cat. 36), idleness and 
wealth, which men count the first (objects of desire). 
eae friigés et friictiis qués terra gignit (N. D. ii. 37), those fruits and crops 
which the earth produces. 
For the Person of the verb agreeing with the Relative, see § 316. a. 
306. A Relative generally agrees in gender and number with an 
appositive or predicate noun in its own clause, rather than with 
an antecedent of different gender or number (cf. § 296. a): — 
mare etiam quem Neptiinum esse dicébis (N. D. iii. 52), the sea, too, which 
you said was Neptune. [Not quod.] 
Thébae ipsae, quod Boedtiae caput est (Liv. xlii. 44), even Thebes, which is 
the chief city of Boeotia. [Not quae.] 
Norg. — This rule is occasionally violated: as,—fliimen quod appellatur Tamesis 
(B. G. v. 11), a river which is called the Thames. 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
    186 SYNTAX: PRONOUNS [S$ 806, 807 
a. A relative occasionally agrees with its antecedent in case (by 
attraction) : — 
si aliquid agas edrum quorum cénsuésti (Fam. v. 14), if you should do some- 
thing of what you are used to do. [For edrum quae. ] 
Nors. — Occasionally the antecedent is attracted into the case of the relative: — 
urbem quam statu6 vestra est (Aen. i. 573), the city which I am founding is yours. 
Naucratem, quem convenire volui, in navi nén erat (Pl. Am. 1009), Naucrates, 
whom I wished to meet, was not on board the ship. 
b. A relative may agree in gender and number with an implied 
antecedent : — 
quartum genus . . . qui in vetere aere aliéné vacillant (Cat. ii. 21), a fourth 
class, who are staggering under old debts. 
tinus ex ed numerd qui parati erant (Iug. 35), one of the number [of those] 
who were ready. 
conifirdvére pauci, dé qua [i.e. coniiiratidne] dicam (Sall. Cat. 18), a few 
have conspired, of which [conspiracy] I will speak. 
Norg.—So regularly when the antecedent is implied in a possessive pronoun: as, 
—nostra acta, qués tyrannds vociis (Vat. 29), the deeds of us, whom you call tyrants. 
[Here qués agrees with the nostrum (genitive plural) implied in nostra.] 
Antecedent of the Relative 
307. The Antecedent Noun sometimes appears in both clauses ; 
but usually only in the one that precedes. Sometimes it is 
wholly omitted. 
a. The antecedent noun may be repeated in the relative clause : — 
loci natiira erat haec quem locum nostri délégerant (B. G. ii. 18), the nature 
of the ground which our men had chosen was this. 
b. The antecedent noun may appear only in the relative clause, 
agreeing with the relative in case : — 
quas rés in consulati nostrd gessimus attigit hic versibus (Arch. 28), he has 
touched in verse the things which I did in my consulship. 
quae prima innocentis mihi défénsid est oblata suscépi (Sull. 92), I wnder- 
took the first defence of an innocent man that was offered me. 
Nortr.—In this case the relative clause usually comes first (cf. § 308. d) and a 
demonstrative usually stands in the antecedent clause: — 
quae pars civitatis calamitatem populd Roémané intulerat, ea princeps poenis per- 
solvit (B. G. i. 12), that part of the state which had brought disaster on the 
Roman people was the first to pay the penalty. 
quae gratia currum fuit vivis, eadem sequitur (Aen. vi. 653), the same pleasure 
that they took in chariots in their lifetime follows them (after death). 
qui fit ut ném6, quam sibi sortem ratid dederit, ill4 contentus vivat (cf. Hor. 8. i. 
1.1), how does it happen that no one lives contented with the lot which choice 
has assigned him?
-P-A-G-E-199
  §§ 807, 308] RELATIVE PRONOUNS 187 
ec. The antecedent may be omitted, especially if it is indefinite : — 
qui decimae legidnis aquilam ferébat (B. G. iv. 25), [the man] who bore the 
eagle of the tenth legion. 
qui cognéscerent misit (id. i. 21), he sent [men] to reconnoitre. 
d. The phrase id quod or quae rés may be used (instead of quod 
alone) to refer to a group of words or an idea: — 
[obtrectatum est] Gabinio dicam anne Pompéid? an utrique— id quod est 
vérius ? (Manil. 57), an affront has been offered — shall I say to Gabinius 
or to Pompey ? or — which is truer —to both? 
multum sunt in vénatidnibus, quae rés virés alit (B. G. iv. 1), they spend 
much time in hunting, which [practice] increases their strength. 
Nore. — Butquod alone often occurs: as, — Cassius noster, quod mihi magnae volup- 
tati fuit, hostem réiécerat (Fam. ii. 10), our friend Cassius — which was a great satis- 
Saction to me—had driven back the enemy. 
e. The antecedent noun, when in apposition with the main clause, 
or with some word of it, is put in the relative clause : — 
firmi [amici], cfiius generis est magna péniiria (Lael. 62), steadfast friends, 
a class of which there is great lack (of which class there is, etc.), 
f. A predicate adjective (especially a superlative) belonging to the 
antecedent may stand in the relative clause : — 
vasa ea quae pulcherrima apud eum viderat (Verr. iv. 63), those most beauti- 
ful vessels which he had seen at his house. [Nearly equivalent to the 
vessels of which he had seen some very beautiful ones. ] 
Special Uses of the Relative 
308. In the use of Relatives, the following points are to be 
observed : — 
a. The relative is never omitted in Latin, as it often is in Eng- 
lish : — 
liber quem mihi dedisti, the book you gave me. 
is sum qui semper fui, I am the same man I always was. 
e6 in locd est dé qué tibi lociitus sum, he is in the place I told you of. 
b. When two relative clauses are connected by a copulative con- 
junction, a relative pronoun sometimes stands in the first and a 
demonstrative in the last : — 
erat profectus obviam legidnibus Macedonicis quattuor, quas sibi concilidre 
peciinia cdgitabat easque ad urbem addiicere (Fam. xii. 23. 2), he had 
set out to meet four legions from Macedonia, which he thought to win over 
to himself by a gift of money and to lead (them) to the city.
-P-A-G-E-200
  188 SYNTAX: PRONOUNS [§ 808 
ce. A relative clause in Latin often takes the place of some other 
construction in English, — particularly of a par ciple, an appositive, 
or a noun of agency : — 
légés quae nunc sunt, the existing laws (the laws which now exist). 
Caesar qui Galliam vicit, Cesar the conqueror of Gaul. 
iista gloria qui est friictus virtiitis (Pison. 57), true glory [which is] the fruit 
of virtue. 
ille qui petit, the plaintiff (he who sues). 
qui legit, a reader (one who reads). 
ad. In formal or emphatic discourse, the relative clause usually 
comes first, often containing the antecedent noun (cf. § 307. 6): — 
quae pars civitatis Helvétiae insignem calamitatem populd Romand intulerat, 
ea princeps poenis persolvit (B. G. i. 12), the portion of the Helvetian 
state which had brought a serious disaster on the Roman people was the 
Jirst to pay the penalty. 
Norx. —In colloquial language, the relative clause in such cases often contains a 
redundant Berra pronoun which logically belongs in the antecedent clause: 
he who is on his guard, fa may long enioy what he has well obtained. 
e. The relative with an abstract noun may be used in a parenthet- 
ical clause to characterize a person, like the English such :— 
quae vestra priidentia est (Cael. 45), such is your wisdom. [Equivalent to 
pro vestra pridentia.] 
audissés cOmoedés vel léctérem vel lyristén, vel, quae mea liberalitas, omnés 
(Plin. Ep. i. 15), you would have listened to comedians, or a reader, or @ 
lyre-player, or — such is my liberality —to all of them. 
- f. A relative pronoun (or adverb) often stands at the beginning of 
an independent sentence or clause, serving to connect it with the 
sentence or clause that precedes : — 
Caesar statuit exspectandam classem; quae ubi convénit (B. G. iii. 14), 
Cesar decided that he must wait for the fleet; and when this had come 
together, etc. 
quae qui audiébant, and those who heard this (which things). 
quae cum ita sint, and since this is so. 
quorum quod simile factum (Cat. iv. 13), what deed of theirs like this? 
qué cum vénisset, and. when he had come there (whither when he had come). 
Nor. — This arrangement is common even when another relative or an interrog- 
ative follows. The relative may usually be translated by an English demonstrative, 
with or without and. 
g- A relative adverb is regularly used in referring to an antecedent 
in the Locative case; so, often, to express any relation of place instead 
of the formal relative pronoun : —
-P-A-G-E-201
§§ 308-310] INDEFINITE PRONOUNS 189 
mortuus Ciimis quo sé contulerat (Liv. ii. 21), having died at Cuma, whither 
he had retired. [Here in quam urbem might be used, but not in quas.] 
locus qué aditus non erat, a place to which (whither) there was no access. 
régna unde genus diicis (Aen. y. 801), the kingdom from which you derive 
your race. 
| unde petitur, the defendant (he from whom something is demanded). 
h. The relatives qui, qualis, quantus, quot, etc. are often rendered 
simply by as in English: — 
idem quod semper, the same as always. 
cum esset talis qualem té esse vided (Mur. 32), since he was such a man as I 
see you are. 3 
tanta dimicatid quanta numquam fuit (Att. vii. 1. 2), such a fight as never 
was before. 
tot mala quot sidera (Ov. Tr. i. 5. 47), as many troubles as stars in the sky. 
  i. The general construction of relatives is found in clauses intro- 
duced by relative adverbs: as, ubi, qué, unde, cum, quaré. 
Indefinite Pronouns 
309. The Indefinite Pronouns are used to indicate that some 
person or thing is meant, without designating what one. 
310. Quis, quispiam, aliquis, quidam, are particular indefinites, mean- 
ing some, a certain, any. Of these, quis, any one, is least definite, 
and quidam, a certain one, most definite ; aliquis and quispiam, some 
one, stand between the two:— 
dixerit quis (quispiam), some one may say. 
aliqui philosophi ita putant, some philosophers think so. [quidam would mean 
certain persons defined to the speaker’s mind, though not named. ] 
habitant hic quaedam mulierés pauperculae (Ter. Ad. 647), some poor women 
live here [i.e. some women he knows of; some women or other would 
be aliquae or nescid quae]. 
a. The indefinite quis is rare except in the combinations si quis, if 
any; nisi quis, if any... not; né quis, lest any, in order that none ; 
num quis (ecquis), whether any ; and in relative clauses. 
b. The compounds quispiam and aliquis are often used instead of 
quis after si, nisi, né, and num, and are rather more emphatic : — 
quid si hdc quispiam voluit deus (Ter. Eun. 875), what if some god had 
desired this? 
nisi alicui sudrum negitium daret (Nep. Dion. 8. 2), unless he should employ 
some one of his friends. 
cavébat Pompéius omnia, né aliquid vos timérétis (Mil. 66), Pompey took 
every precaution, so that you might have no feur. 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
        190 SYNTAX: PRONOUNS [$§ 311-818 
311. In a particular negative aliquis (aliqui), some one (some), is 
regularly used, where in a universal negative quisquam, any one, 
or illus, any, would be required : — 
ifistitia numquam nocet cuiquam (Fin. i. 50), justice never does harm to any- 
body. [alicui would mean to somebody who possesses it.] 
non sine aliqué metii, not without some fear. But,—sine alld meti, without 
any fear. 
cum aliquid non habeas (Tusc. i. 88), when there is something you have not. 
Nore. — The same distinction holds-between quis and aliquis on the one hand, and 
quisquam (illus) on the other, in conditional and other sentences when a negative is 
expressed or suggested : — 
8i quisquam, ille sapiéns fuit (Lael. 9), if any man was (ever) a sage, he was. 
dum praesidia illa fuérunt (Rose. Am. 126), while there were any armed forces. 
si quid in té peccivi (Att. iii. 15. 4), if I have done wrong towards you [in any 
particular case (see § 310)]. 
312. Quivis or quilibet (any one you will), quisquam, and the cor- 
responding adjective illus, any at all, are general indefinites. 
Quivis and quilibet are used chiefly in affirmative clauses, quisquam 
and illus in clauses where a universal negative is expressed or sug- 
gested : — 
non cuivis hominicontingit adire Corinthum (Hor. Ep. i. 17. 86), it is not every 
man’s luck to go to Corinth. [non cuiquam would mean not any man’s. | 
quemlibet modo aliquem (Acad. ii. 182), anybody you will, provided it be 
somebody. 
si quisquam est timidus, is ego sum (Fam. vi. 14. 1), if aay man is timorous, 
Tam he. 
si tempus est fllum iiire hominis necandi (Mil. 9), if there is any occasion 
whatever when homicide is justifiable. 
Nore. — The use of the indefinites is very various, and must be learned from the 
Lexicon and from practice. The choice among them may depend merely on the point 
of view of the speaker, so that they are often practically interchangeable. The differ- 
ences are (with few exceptions) those of logic, not of syntax. 
313. The distributives quisque (every), uterque (each of two), and 
iinus quisque (every single one) are used in general assertions: 
bonus liber melior est quisque qué maior (Plin. Ep. i. 20. 4), the larger a 
good book is, the better (each good book is better in proportion, etc.). 
ambé exercitiis suas quisque abeunt domds (Liv. ii. 7. 1), both armies go 
away, every man to his home. 
uterque utrique erat exercitus in cénspectii (B. G. vii. 35), each army was 
in sight of the other (each to each). 
ponite ante oculds inum quemque régum (Par. i. 11), set before your eyes each 
of the kings.

a. Quisque regularly stands in a dependent clause, if there is one: — 
quo quisque est sollertior, hc docet iracundius (Rosc. Com. 31), the keener- 
witted a man is, the more impatiently he teaches. 
Nore. — Quisque is generally postpositive!: as, suum cuique, to every man his own. 
b. Quisque is idiomatically used with superlatives and with ordinal 
numerals : — 
ndbilissimus quisque, all the noblest (one after the other in the order of their 
nobility).? 
prim6 qudque tempore (Rosc. Am. 36), at the very first opportunity. 
antiquissimum quodque tempus (B. G. i. 45), the most ancient times. 
decimus quisque (id. v. 52), one in ten. 
Nore 1.— Two superlatives with quisque imply a proportion: as,— sapientissimus 
quisque aequissimd animo moritur (Cat. M. 83), the wisest men die with the greatest 
equanimity. 
Nore 2.—Quotus quisque has the signification of how many, pray? often in a dis- 
paraging sense (how few) : — 
quotus enim quisque disertus? quotus quisque iiiris peritus est (Planc. 62), for how 
Sew are eloquent! how few are learned in the law! 
quotus enim istud quisque fécisset (Lig. 26), for how many would have done this? 
[i.e. scarcely anybody would have done it]. 
314, Némé, no one, is used of persons only — 
1. As a substantive :— 
néminem acciisat, he accuses no one. 
2. As an adjective pronoun instead of niillus : — 
vir némd bonus (Legg. ii. 41), no good man. 
Nore. — Even when used as a substantive, ném6 may take a noun in appositiou. 
as,—ném6 scriptor, nobody [who is] a writer. 
a. Nillus, no, is commonly an adjective; but in the genitive and 
ablative singular it is regularly used instead of the corresponding 
cases of némd, and in the plural it may be either an adjective or a 
substantive : — 
nillum mittitur télum (B. C. ii. 13), not a missile is thrown. 
nilld hoste prohibente (B. G. iii. 6), without opposition from the enemy. 
nillius insector calamitatem (Phil. ii. 98), I persecute the misfortune of no one. 
nalld adiuvante (id. x. 4), with the help of no one (no one helping). 
nilli erant praeddnés (Flacc. 28), there were no pirates. 
nalli eximentur (Pison. 94), none shall be taken away. 
  For non ném6, non niillus (nn niilli), see § 326. a.

Alius and Alter 
815. Alius means simply other, another (of an indefinite num- 
ber); alter, the other (of two), often the second in a series; céteri 
and reliqui, all the rest, the others ; alteruter, one of the two: — 
propterea quod aliud iter habérent niillum (B. G. i. 7), because (as they 
said) they had no other way.

number where one is opposed to ail the rest taken singly : — 
dum né sit té ditior alter (Hor. S. i. 1.40), so long as another is not richer than 
you (lit. the other, there being at the moment only two persons considered). 
non ut magis alter, amicus (id. i. 5. 33), a friend such that no other is more so. 
a. The expressions alter... alter, the one... the other, alius... 
alius, one . . . another, may be used in pairs to denote either division 
of a group or reciprocity of action : — - 
alteri dimicant, alteri victorem timent (Fam. vi. 8), one party fights, the 
other fears the victor. 
alteram alteri praesidid esse iusserat (B. C. iii, 89), he had ordered each (of

another thing). 
iussit alids alibi fodere (Liv. xliv. 38), he ordered different persons to dig in

ego statud, I resolve. senatus décrévit, the senate ordered. 
silent légés inter arma (Mil. 11), the laws are dumb in time of war. 
Nors.— In verb-forms containing a participle, the participle agrees with the sub- 
ject in gender and number (§ 286): — 
Oratid est habita, the plea was delivered. bellum exortum est, a war arose. 
a. A verb having a relative as its subject takes the person of the

ablative with cum: as,—dux cum aliquot principibus capiuntur (Liv. xxi. 60), the 
general and several leading men are taken. 
a. When subjects are of different persons, the verb is usually in 
the first person rather than the second, and in the second rather than 
the third : — 
si ti et Tullia valétis ego et Cicerd valémus (Fam. xiv. 5), if you and Tullia

and Quintus Cassius, tribunes of the people, interpose. 
hoc mihi et Peripatétici et vetus Académia concédit (Acad. ii. 113), this both 
the Peripatetic philosophers and the Old Academy grant me. 
d. A collective noun commonly takes a verb in the singular; but 
the plural is often found with collective nouns when individuals are 
thought of (§ 280. a): — 
(1) senatus haec intellegit (Cat. i. 2), the senate is aware of this. 
ad hiberna exercitus redit (Liv. xxi. 22), the army returns to winter-quarters. 
plébés 4 patribus sécessit (Sall. Cat. 33), the plebs seceded from the patricians. 
(2) pars praedas agébant (Iug. 32), a part brought in booty. 
cum tanta multitidd lapidés conicerent (B. G. ii. 6), when such a crowd were 
throwing stones. 
Nore 1.—The point of view may change in the course of a sentence: as,—equiti- 
tum omnem . . . quem habébat praemittit, qui videant (B. G. i. 15), he sent ahead all 
the cavalry he had, to see (who should see). 
Nore 2.— The singular of a noun regularly denoting an individual is sometimes 
used collectively to denote a group: as, Poenus, the Carthaginians; miles, the soldiery; 
eques, the cavalry. 
e. Quisque, each, and iinus quisque, every single one, have very often 
a plural verb, but may be considered as in partitive apposition with a 
plural subject implied (cf. § 282. a): — 
sibi quisque habeant quod suum est (PI. Curc. 180), let every one keep his 
own (let them keep every man his own). 
Nore. —So also uterque, each (of two), and the reciprocal phrases alius . . . alium, 
alter . . . alterum (§ 315. a).

§§ 818, 319] OMISSION OF SUBJECT OR VERB 195 
Omission of Subject or Verb 
318. The Subject of the Verb is sometimes omitted : — 
a. A Personal pronoun, as subject, is usually omitted unless em- 
phatic : — 
loquor, I speak. But, ego loquor, it is I that speak. 
b. An indefinite subject is often omitted: —créderés, you would 
have supposed ; putamus, we (people) think ; dicunt, ferunt, perhibent, 
they say. 
ce. A passive verb is often used impersonally without a subject ex- 
pressed or understood (§ 208. d):— 
diti atque acriter pignatum est (B. G. i. 26), they fought long and vigorously. 
319. The verb is sometimes omitted : — 
a. Dic, facid, agd, and other common verbs are often omitted in 
familiar phrases : — 
quorsum haec [spectant], what does this aim at? 
ex ungue lednem [cdgnéscés], you will know a lion by his claw. 
quid multa, what need of many words? (why should I say much ?) 
quid? quod, what of this, that. . .? (what shall I say of this, that. . . ?) 
[A form of transition. ] 
Aeolus haec contra (Aen. i. 76), Zolus thus [spoke] in reply. 
tum Cotta [inquit], then said Cotta. 
di melidra [duint] ! (Cat. M. 47), Heaven forfend (may the gods grant better 
things) ! 
unde [venis] et quo [tendis]? (Hor. S. ii. 4. 1), where from and whither 
bound? ([Cf. id. i. 9. 62 for the full form.] 
b. The copula sum is very commonly omitted in the present indica- 
tive and present infinitive, rarely (except by late authors) in the sub- 
junctive : — 
ti conifinx (Aen. iv. 118), you [are] his wife. 
quid ergd? audacissimus ego ex omnibus (Rosc. Am. 2), what then? am I 
the boldest of all ? 
omnia praeclara rara (Lael. 79), all the best things are rare. 
potest incidere saepe contentid et comparatid dé dudbus honestis utrum 
honestius (Off. i. 152), there may often occur a comparison of two 
honorable actions, as to which is the more honorable. [Here, if any 
copula were expressed, it would be sit, but the direct question would 
be complete without any.] 
accipe quae peragenda prius (Aen. vi. 136), hear what is first to be accom- 
plished. [Direct: quae peragenda prius ?]

    196 SYNTAX: PARTICLES [8§ 820, 321 
PARTICLES 
Adverbs 
$20. The proper function of Adverbs, as petrified case-forms, is to modify Verbs: 
as,—celeriter ire, to go with speed. It is from this use that they derive their name 
(adverbium, from ad, fo, and verbum, verb; see § 241. b). They also modify adjectives, 
showing in what manner or degree the quality described is manifested: as, splendidé 
mendax, gloriously false. More rarely they modify other adverbs: as, nimis graviter, 
too severely. Many adverbs, especially relative adverbs, serve as connectives, and 
are hardly to be distinguished from conjunctions (see § 20. g. N.).1 
321. Adverbs are used to modify Verbs, Adjectives, and other 
Adverbs. 
a. A Demonstrative or Relative adverb is often equivalent to the 
corresponding Pronoun with a preposition (see § 308. g):— 
ed [=in ea] imponit visa (Iug. 75), wpon them (thither, thereon, on the 
beasts) he puts the camp-utensils. 
e6 milités impdnere (B. G. i. 42), to put soldiers upon them (the horses). 
apud eds qué [= ad quis] sé contulit (Verr. iv. 88), among those to whom 
(whither) he resorted. 
qui eum necasset unde [ = qué] ipse natus esset (Rose. Am. 71), one who should 
have killed his own father (him whence he had his birth). 
6 condiciénés miseris administrandarum provinciarum ubi [= in quibus] 
sevéritas periculdsa est (Flacc. 87), O! wretched terms of managing the 
provinces, where strictness is dangerous. 
  b. The participles dictum and factum, when used as nouns, are regu- 
larly modified by adverbs rather than by adjectives ; so occasionally 
other perfect participles : — ‘ 
praeclaré facta (Nep. Timoth. 1), glorious deeds (things gloriously done). 
multa facété dicta (Off. i. 104), many witty sayings. 
ec, A noun is sometimes used as an adjective, and may then be modi- 
fied by an adverb : — 
victor exercitus, the victorious army. 
admodum puer, quite a boy (young). 
magis vir, more of a man (more manly). 
populum laté régem (Aen. i. 21), a people ruling far and wide. 
Norg.— Very rarely adverbs are used with nouns which have no adjective force 
but which contain a verbal idea: — 
hine abitid (Plaut. Rud. 503), a going away from here. 
quid cdgitem dé obviam itidne (Att. xiii. 50), what I think about going to meet 
(him). [Perhaps felt as a compound.) 
1 For the derivation and classification of adverbs, see §§ 214-217.
-P-A-G-E-209
  §§ 821, 822] ADVERBS 197 
d. A few adverbs appear to be used like adjectives. Such are 
obviam, palam, sometimes contra, and occasionally others : — 
fit obviam Cl6did (Mil. 29), he falls in with (becomes in the way of) Clodius. 
[Cf. the adjective obvius : as, —si ille obvius ei futiirus non erat (id. 47), 
if he was not likely to fall in with him.] 
haec commemor6 quae sunt palam (Pison. 11), I mention these facts, which 
are well-known. 
alia probabilia, contra alia dicimus (Off. ii. 7), we call some things probable, 
others the opposite (not probable). [In this use, contra contradicts a 
previous adjective, and so in a manner repeats it. ] 
eri semper lénitas (Ter. And. 175), my master’s constant (always) gentleness. 
[An imitation of a Greek construction. ] 
Norr.—In some cases one can hardly say whether the adverb is treated as an 
adjective modifying the noun, or the noun modified is treated as an adjective (as in 
c above). 
For propius, pridié, palam, and other adverbs used as prepositions, see § 432. 
322. The following adverbs require special notice : — 
a. Etiam (et iam), also, even, is stronger than quoque, also, and 
usually precedes the emphatic word, while quoque follows it : — 
non yerbis sdlum sed etiam vi (Verr. ii. 64), not only by words, but also by 
force. 
hdc quoque maleficium (Rose. Am. 117), this crime too. 
b. Nunc! means definitely now, in the immediate present, and is 
rarely used of the immediate past. 
Iam means now, already, at length, presently, and includes a refer- 
ence to previous time through which the state of things described has 
been or will be reached. It may be used of any time. With nega- 
tives iam means (no) longer. 
Tum, then, is correlative to cum, when, and may be used of any 
time. Tunc, then, at that time, is a strengthened form of tum 
({tum-ce, cf. nunc) : — 
ut iam antea dixi, as I have already said before. 
si iam satis aetatis atque rdboris habéret (Rosc. Am. 149), if he had attained 
a suitable age and strength (lit. if he now had, as he will have by and by). 
non est iam lénitati locus, there is no longer room for mercy. 
quod iam erat instititum, which had come to be a practice (had now been 
established). 
nunc quidem déléta est, tune flrébat (Lael. 13), now (’tis true) she [Greece] 
is ruined, then she was tn her glory. 
tum cum régnabat, at the time when he reigned. 
1 For tnum-ce ; cf. tune (for ftum-ce).

| 198 SYNTAX: PARTICLES [S§ 322, 328 
e. Certd means certainly, certé (usually) at least, at any rate: — 
certd scid, I know for a certainty ; ego certé, I at least. 
d. Primum means first (first in order, or for the first time), and 
implies a series of events or acts, Primd means at first, as opposed 
to afterwards, giving prominence merely to the difference of time : — 
hoc primum sentis, this I hold in the first place. 
aedis primd ruere rébamur, at first we thought the house was falling. 
Nor. — In enumerations, primum (or prim6) is often followed by deinde, secondly, in 
the next place, or by tum, then, or by both in succession, Deinde may be several times 
repeated (secondly, thirdly, etc.). The series is often closed by dénique or postrém6, 
lastly, finally. Thus, —primum dé genere belli, deinde dé magnitiidine, tum dé im- 
peratore déligendd (Manil. 6), first of the kind of war, next of its magnitude, then of 
the choice of a commander. 
e. Quidem, indeed, gives emphasis, and often has a concessive mean- 
ing, especially when followed by sed, autem, etc.: — 
hic quidem vidére licet (Lael. 54), rus surely one may see. [Emphatic.] 
[séciiritas] specié quidem blanda, sed reapse multis locis repudianda (id. 47), 
(tranquillity) in appearance, ’tis true, attractive, but in reality to be 
rejected for many reasons. [Concessive. ] 
f. Né... quidem means not even or not... either. The emphatic 
word or words must stand between né and quidem : — 
sed né Iugurtha quidem quiétus erat (Iug. 51), but Jugurtha was not quiet 
either. 
ego autem né irdsci possum quidem iis quos valdé amd (Att. ii. 19. 1), but I 
cannot even get angry with those whom I love very much. 
  Notr. — Equidem has the same senses as quidem, but is in Cicero confined to the 
first person. Thus, —equidem adprobabo (Fam. ii. 3. 2), I for my part shall approve. 
CONJUNCTIONS? 
323. Copulative and Disjunctive Conjunctions connect similar 
constructions, and are regularly followed by the same case or mood 
that precedes them: — 
scriptum sendtui et populd (Cat. iii. 10), written to the senate and people. 
ut eas [partis] sinarés et codnfirmarés (Mil. 68), that you might cure and 
strengthen those parts. 
neque mea priidentia neque himanis consiliis frétus (Cat. ii. 29), relying 
neither on my own foresight nor on human wisdom. 
1 For the classification of conjunctions, see §§ 223, 224,
-P-A-G-E-211
  
§ 823] CONJUNCTIONS 199 
a. Conjunctions of Comparison (as ut, quam, tamquam, quasi) also 
commonly connect similar constructions : — 
his igitur quam physicis potius crédendum existimas (Div. ii. 37), do you 
think these are more to be trusted than the natural philosophers ? 
hominem callididrem vidi néminem quam Phormidnem (Ter. Ph. 591), a 
shrewder man I never saw than Phormio (cf. § 407). 
ut non omne vinum sic non omnis natiira vetustite coacéscit (Cat. M. 65), 
as every wine does not sour with age, so [does] not every nature. 
in mé quasi in tyrannum (Phil. xiv. 15), against me as against a tyrant. 
b. ‘Two or more codrdinate words, phrases, or sentences are often 
put together without the use of conjunctions (Asyndeton, § 601. ¢): 
omnés di, hominés, all gods and men. 
summi, medii, infimi, the highest, the middle class, and the lowest. 
ira, légés, agrés, libertétem nobis reliquérunt (B. G. vii. 77), they have left 
us our rights, owr laws, our fields, our liberty. 
ec. 1, Where there are more than two codrdinate words ete., a con- 
junction, if used, is ordinarily used with all (or all except the first): — 
aut aere aliénd aut magnitiidine tribitdrum aut iniiria potentidrum (B. G. 
vi. 13), by debt, excessive taxation, or oppression on the part of the 
powerful. 
at sunt mérdsi et anxii et irdcundi et difficilés senés (Cat. M. 65), but (you 
say) old men are capricious, solicitous, choleric, and fussy. 
2. But words are often so divided into groups that the members 
of the groups omit the conjunction (or express it), while the groups 
themselves express the conjunction (or omit it): — 
propudium illud et portentum, L. Antdnius insigne odium omnium homi- 
num (Phil. xiv. 8), that wretch and monster, Lucius Antonius, the abomi- 
nation of all men. 
utrumque égit graviter, auctoritate et offénsidne animi ndn acerba (Lael. 
77), he acted in both cases with dignity, without loss of authority and 
with no bitterness of feeling. 
38. The enclitic -que is sometimes used with the last member of a 
series, even when there is no grouping apparent : — 
voce voltii motiique (Brut. 110), by voice, expression, and gesture. 
ctram cénsilium vigilantiamque (Phil. vii. 20), care, wisdom, and vigilance. 
quorum auctoritatem dignitatem yoluntatemque défenderas (Fam. i. 7. 2), 
whose dignity, honor, and wishes you had defended. 
d. Two adjectives belonging to the same noun are regularly con 
nected by a conjunction : — 
multae et gravés causae, many weighty reasons. 
vir liber ac fortis (Rep. ii. 34), a free and brave man. 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  200 SYNTAX: PARTICLES [S§ 828, 824 
e. Often the same conjunction is repeated in two coérdinate clauses: 
et... et (que... -que), both... and. 
aut... aut, either... or. 
vel... vel, either...or. [Examples in § 324. e.] 
sive (seu) . . . sive (seu), whether...or. [Examples in § 824. f.] 
f. Many adverbs are similarly used in pairs, as conjunctions, partly 
or wholly losing their adverbial force : — 
nunc... nunc, tum... tum, iam... iam, now... now. 
modo... modo, now... now. 
simul . simul, at the same time... at the same time. 
qua... qua, now... now, both... and, alike [this] and [that]. 
modo ait modo negat (Ter. Eun. 714), now he says yes, now no. 
simul gratias agit, simul gratulatur (Q. C. vi. 7. 15), he thanks him and at 
the same time congratulates him. 
érumpunt saepe vitia amicdrum tum in ipsds amicds tum in alignds (Lael. 
76), the faults of friends sometimes break out, now against their friends 
themselves, now against strangers. 
qua maris qua féminas (Pl. Mil. 1113), both males and females.    
g. Certain relative and demonstrative adverbs are used correla- 
tively as conjunctions: — 
ut (rel.) ... ita, sic (dem.), as (while). . . so (yet). 
tam (dem.) . . . quam (rel.), so (as)... as. 
cum (rel.) .. . tum (dem.), while... so also; not only. . . but also. 
324, The following Conjunctions require notice : — 
a. Et, and, simply connects words or clauses; -que combines more 
closely into one connected whole. -que is always enclitic to the word 
connected or to the first or second of two or more words connected : 
cum coniugibus et liberis, with [their] wives and children. 
ferrd ignique, with fire and sword. [Not as separate things, but as the 
combined means of devastation. ] 
aqua et igni interdictus, forbidden the use of water and fire. [In a legal 
formula, where they are considered separately. ] 
b. Atque (ac), and, adds with some emphasis or with some implied 
reflection on the word added. Hence it is often equivalent to and so, 
and yet, and besides, and then. But these distinctions depend very 
much upon the feeling of the speaker, and are often untranslatable: — 
omnia honesta atque inhonesta, everything honorable and dishonorable (Gaoog 
without the slightest distinction). 
iisus atque disciplina, practice and theory beside (the more important or less 
expected). 
atque ego créd6, and yet I believe (for my part).
-P-A-G-E-213
  § 324] CONJUNCTIONS 201 
c. Atque (ac), in the sense of as, than, is also used after words of 
comparison and likeness : — 
simul atque, as soon as. 
ndn secus (n6n aliter) ac si, not otherwise than if. 
pro ed ac débui, as was my duty (in accordance as I ought). 
aequé ac ti, as much as you. 
haud minus ac iussi faciunt, they do just as they are ordered. 
For and not, see § 328. a. 
d, Sed and the more emphatic vérum or vérd, but, are used to intro- 
duce something in opposition to what precedes, especially after nega- 
tives (not this . . . but something else). At (old form ast) introduces 
with emphasis a new point in an argument, but is also used like the 
others; sometimes it means atleast, At enim is almost always used. 
to introduce a supposed objection which is presently to be overthrown. 
At is more rarely used alone in this sense. 
Autem, however, now, is the weakest of the adversatives, and often 
marks a mere transition and has hardly any adversative force percep- 
tible. Atqui, however, now, sometimes introduces an objection and 
sometimes afresh step inthereasoning. Quod si, but if, and #f, now if, 
is used to continue an argument. 
Nore. — Et, -que, and atque (ac) are sometimes used where the English idiom would 
suggest but, especially when a negative clause is followed by an affirmative clause 
continuing the same thought: as,—impetum hostés ferre ndn potuérunt ac terga 
vertérunt (B. G. iv. 35), the enemy could not stand the onset, but turned their backs. 
e. Aut, or, excludes the alternative; vel (an old imperative of vold) 
and. -ve give a choice between two alternatives. But this distinction 
is not always observed:— ~~ 
sed quis ego sum aut quae est in mé facultas (Lael. 17), but who am I or 
what special capacity have I? [Here vel could not be used, because in 
fact a negative is implied and both alternatives are excluded. ] 
aut bibat aut abeat (Tusc. vy. 118), let him drink or (if he won’t do that, then 
let him) quit. [Here vel would mean, let him do either as he chooses. ] 
vita talis fuit vel fortima vel gloria (Lael. 12), his life was such either in 
respect to fortune or fame (whichever way you look at it). 
si propinqués habeant imbécillidrés vel anim6 vel fortiina (id. 70), if they 
have relatives beneath them either in spirit or in fortune (in either respect, 
for example, or in both). 
_ aut dedrum aut régum filii (id. 70), sons either of gods or of kings. [Here 
one case would exclude the other. ] 
implicati vel fisi diiiturnd vel etiam officiis (id. 85), entangled either by 
close intimacy or even by obligations. [Here the second case might 
exclude the first.]

    202 SYNTAX: THE SENTENCE [s 324 
f. Sive (seu) is properly used in disjunctive conditions (if either... 
or if), but also with alternative words and clauses, especially with 
two names for the same thing : — 
sive inridéns sive quod ita putaret (De Or. i. 91), either laughingly or because 
he really thought so. 
sive deae seu sint volucrés (Aen. iii. 262), whether they (the Harpies) are 
goddesses or birds. 
g- Vel, even, for instance, is often used as an intensive particle with 
no alternative force: as, —vel minimus, the very least. 
h, Nam and namque, for, usually introduce a real reason, formally 
expressed, for a previous statement; enim (always postpositive), a 
less important explanatory circumstance put in by the way; etenim 
(for, you see ; for, you know ; for, mind you) and its negative neque 
enim introduce something self-evident or needing no proof. 
(ea vita) quae est sola vita ndminanda. nam dum sumus inclisi in his 
compagibus corporis, miinere quédam necessitatis et gravi opere per- 
fungimur; est enim animus caelestis, etc. (Cat. M. 77), (that life) 
which alone deserves to be called life; for so long as we are confined by 
the body’s frame, we perform a sort of necessary function and heavy 
task. For the soul is from heaven. 
harum trium sententiérum nilli prorsus adsentior. nec enim illa prima 
véra est (Lael. 57), for of course that first one isn’t true. 
i, Ergo, therefore, is used of things proved formally, but often has 
a weakened force. Igitur, then, accordingly, is weaker than ergd and 
is used in passing from one stage of an argument to another. Itaque, 
therefore, accordingly, and so, is used in proofs or inferences from the 
nature of things rather than in formal logical proof. All of these are 
often used merely to resume a train of thought broken by a digression 
or parenthesis. Idcircd, for this reason, on this account, is regularly 
followed (or preceded) by a correlative (as, quia, quod, si, ut, né), and 
refers to the special point introduced by the correlative. 
malum mihi vidétur esse mors. est miserum igitur, quoniam malum. certé. 
ergo et ei quibus événit iam ut morerentur et ei quibus éventiirum est 
miseri. mihi ita vidétur. némé ergd non miser. (Tusc. i. 9.) - Death 
seems to metobeanevil. ‘Itiswretched, then, since it is anevil.’? Certainly. 
‘Therefore, all those who have already died and who are to die hereafter are 
wretched.’ So it appears to me. ‘ There is no one, therefore, who is not 
wretched.’

j. Autem, enim, and vérd are postpositive'; so generally igitur and 
often tamen. 
k. Two conjunctions of similar meaning are often used together 
for the sake of emphasis or to bind a sentence more closely to what 
precedes: as, at vérd, but in truth, but surely, still, however; itaque 
ergo, accordingly then; namque, for; et-enim, for, you see, for of 
course (§ 324. h). 
For Conjunctions introducing Subordinate Clauses, see Syntax. 
Negative Particles ? 
325. In the use of the Negative Particles, the following points 
are to be observed : — 
326. Two negatives are equivalent to an affirmative : — 
ném6 non audiet, every one will hear (nobody will not hear). 
non possum non confitéri (Fam. ix. 14. 1), I must confess. 
ut... néndn timére quidem sine aliqud timdre possimus (Mil. 2), so that we 
cannot even be relieved of fear without some fear. 
a. Many compounds or phrases of which non is the first part express 
an indefinite affirmative : — 
non nillus, some; non niilli (=aliqui), some few. 
non nihil (= aliquid), something. 
ndn némd (= aliquot), sundry persons. 
ndn numquam (= aliquotiéns), sometimes. 
b. Two negatives of which the second is nin (belonging to the 
predicate) express a universal affirmative : — 
némé non, nillus non, nobody [does] not, i.e. everybody [does]. [Cf. ndn 
némé, not nobody, i.e. somebody.] 
nihil non, everything. [Cf. non nihil, something.) 
numquam non, never not, i.e. always. [Cf. ndn numquam, sometimes. ] 
c. A statement is often made emphatic by denying its contrary 
(Litotes, § 641): — 
non semel (= saepissimé), often enough (not once only). 
noén haec sine niimine divom éveniunt (Aen. ii. 777), these things do not 
occur without the will of the gods. 
haec non nimis exquiré (Att. vii. 18. 3), not very much, i.e. very little. 
Norr. —Compare n6n niillus, non némG, etc., in a above.

327. A general negation is not destroyed — 
1. By a following né . . . quidem, not even, or ndn modo, not only : — 
numquam tii ndn modo dtium, sed né bellum quidem nisi nefarium concupisti 
(Cat. i. 25), not only have you never desired repose, but you have never 
desired any war except one which was infamous. 
2. By succeeding negatives each introducing a separate subordi- 
nate member : — 
eaque nesciébant nec ubi nec qualia essent (Tusce. iii. 4), they knew not where 
or of what kind these things were. 
3. By neque introducing a coérdinate member : — 
nequed satis mirari neque conicere (Ter. Eun. 547), I cannot wonder enough 
nor conjecture. 
328. The negative is frequently joined with a conjunction or 
with an indefinite pronoun or adverb. Hence the forms of nega- 
tion in Latin differ from those in English in many expressions : — 
nilli (neutri) créd6 (not non crédo alli), I do not believe either (I believe 
neither). 
sine alld periculd (less commonly cum niillé), with no danger (without any 
danger). 
nihil umquam audivi iticundius, I never heard anything more amusing. 
Cf. nego haec esse véra (not dicd nin esse), I say this is not true (I deny, etc.). 
a. In the second of two connected ideas, and not is regularly ex- 
pressed by neque (nec), not by et nén : — 
hostés terga vertérunt, neque prius fugere déstitérunt (B. G. i. 53), the enemy 
turned and fled, and did not stop fleeing until, etc. 
Norx.—Similarly nec quisquam is regularly used for et némd; neque illus for et 
niillus; nec umquam for et numquam; néve (neu), for et né. 
329. The particle immo, nay, is used to contradict some part of 
a preceding statement or question, or its form; in the latter case, 
the same statement is often repeated in a stronger form, so that 
immo becomes nearly equivalent to yes (nay but, nay rather): — 
causa igitur ndn bona est? immo optima (Att. ix. 7. 4), is the cause then not 
a good one? on the contrary, the best. 
a. Minus, less (especially with si, if, quo, in order that), and minimé, 
least, often have a negative force : — 
si minus possunt, if they cannot. [For qué minus, see § 558. b.] 
audacissimus ego ex omnibus? minimé (Rose. Am. 2), am I the boldest of 
them all? by no means (not at all).

  §§ 830-332] FORMS OF INTERROGATION 205 
QUESTIONS 
Forms of Interrogation 
330. Questions are either Direct or Indirect. 
1. A Direct Question gives the exact words of the speaker : — 
quid est? what is it? ubi sum? where am I? 
2. An Indirect Question gives the substance of the question, adapted 
to the form of the sentence in which it is quoted. It depends on a verb 
or other expression of asking, doubting, knowing, or the like : — 
rogavit quid esset, he asked what it was. [Direct: quid est, what is it?] 
nescid ubi sim, I know not where Iam. [Direct: ubi sum, where am I?] 
331. Questions in Latin are introduced by special interrogative 
words, and are not distinguished by the order of words, as in 
English.t 
Norx.— The form of Indirect Questions (in English introduced by whether, or by 
an interrogative pronoun or adverb) is in Latin the same as that of Direct; the differ- 
ence being only in the verb, which in indirect questions is regularly in the Subjunc- 
tive (§ 574). 
332. A question of simple fact, requiring the answer yes or no, 
is formed by adding the enclitic -ne to the emphatic word: — 
tine id veritus es (Q. Fr. i. 3. 1), did vou fear that? 
hicine vir usquam nisi in patria moriétur (Mil. 104), shall rH1s man die any- 
where but in his native land? 
is tibi mortemne vidétur aut doldrem timére (Tusc. v. 88), does he seem to 
you to fear death or pain? 
a. The interrogative particle -ne is sometimes omitted : — 
patére tua cdnsilia non sentis (Cat. i. 1), do you not see that your schemes are 
manifest? (you do not see, eh ?) 
Nor. —In such cases, as no sign of interrogation appears, it is often doubtful 
whether the sentence is a question or an ironical statement. 
b. When the enclitic -ne is added to a negative word, as in ndnne, 
an affirmative answer is expected. The particle num suggests a nega- 
tive answer : — 
nodnne animadvertis (N. D. iii. 89), do you not observe? 
num dubium est (Rose. Am. 107), there is no doubt, is there? 
Note. — In Indirect Questions num commonly loses its peculiar force and means 
simply whether.

    206 SYNTAX: QUESTIONS [§§ 382-835 
c. The particle -ne often when added to the verb, less commonly 
when added to some other word, has the force of ndnne : — 
meministine mé in senatii dicere (Cat. i. 7), don’t you remember my saying 
in the Senate? 
récténe interpretor sententiam tuam (Tuse. iii. 37), do I not rightly interpret 
your meaning? 
Nore 1.— This was evidently the original meaning of -ne; but in most cases the 
negative force was lost and -ne was used merely to express a question. So the English 
interrogative no? shades off into eh? 
Nortr 2.— The enclitic -ne is sometimes added to other interrogative words: as, 
utrumne, whether? anne, or; quantane (Hor. S. ii. 3. 317), how big? quone malo (id. ii. 3. 
295), by what curse?   
  333. A question concerning some special circumstance is formed 
by prefixing to the sentence an interrogative pronoun or adverb 
as in English (§ 152): — 
quid exspectias (Cat. ii. 18), what are you looking forward to? 
qué igitur haec spectant (Fam. vi. 6. 11), whither then is all this tending? 
Icare, ubi es (Ov. M. viii. 282), Icarus, where are you? 
quod vectigal vobis tiitum fuit ? quem socium défendistis? cui praesidid 
classibus vestris fuistis ? (Manil. 32), what revenue has been safe for you ? 
what ally have you defended? whom have you guarded with your fleets ? 
Norr. — A question of this form becomes an exclamation by changing the tone of 
the voice: as, — 
qualis vir erat! what a man he was! 
quot calamitatés passi sumus! how many misfortunes we have suffered! 
quo studi consentiunt (Cat. iv. 15), with what zeal they unite! 
a. The particles -nam (enclitic) and tandem may be added to inter- 
rogative pronouns and adverbs for the sake of emphasis : — 
quisnam est, pray who is it? [quis tandem est? would be stronger. ] 
ubinam gentium sumus (Cat. i. 9), where in the world are we? 
in qua tandem urbe hic disputant (Mil. 7), in what city, pray, do they main- 
tain this? 
Norge— Tandem is sometimes added to verbs: — 
ain tandem (Fam. ix. 21), you don’t say so! (say you so, pray ?) 
itane tandem uxdrem dixit Antiphd (Ter. Ph. 231), so then, eh? Antipho’s got 
married. 
Double Questions 
334. A Double or Alternative Question is an inquiry as to 
which of two or more supposed cases is the true one. 
335. In Double or Alternative Questions, utrum or -ne, whether, 
stands in the first member; an, anne, 07, anndn, necne, 07 not, in the 
second; and usually an in the third, if there be one: —

utrum nescis, an pro nihild id putas (Fam. x. 26), is it that you don’t know, 
or do you think nothing of it? 
vosne L. Domitium an vos Domitius déseruit (B. C. ii. 32), did you desert 
Lucius Domitius, or did Domitius desert you? 
quaer6 servosne an liberds (Rosc. Am. 74), I ask whether slaves or free. 
utrum hostem an vos an forttinam utriusque populi ignoratis (Liv. xxi. 10), 
is it the enemy, or yourselves, or the fortune of the two peoples, that you 
do not know? 
Norn. —Anne foranisrare. Necne is rare in direct questions, but in indirect ques- 
tions it is commoner than anndn, In poetry -ne . . . -ne sometimes occurs. 
a. The interrogative particle is often omitted in the first mem- 
ber; in which case an or -ne (anne, necne) may stand in the second: — 
Gabinio dicam anne Pompéié an utrique (Manil. 57), shall I say to Gabinius, 
or to Pompey, or to both? 
sunt haec tua verba necne (Tusc. iii. 41), are these your words or not? 
quaesivi @ Catilina in conventii apud M. Laecam fuisset necne (Cat. ii. 18), i 
I asked Catiline whether he had been at the meeting at Marcus Leca’s 
or not.   b. Sometimes the first member is omitted or implied, and an (anne) 
alone asks the question, —usually with indignation or surprise: — 
an tii miserds putas illds (Tuse. i. 13), what! do you think those men wretched ? 
an iste umquam dé sé bonam spem habuisset, nisi dé vobis malam opinidnem 
animé imbibisset: (Verr. i. 42), would he ever have had good hopes about 
himself unless he had conceived an evil opinion of you? 
c. Sometimes the second member is omitted or implied, and utrum 
may ask a question to which there is no alternative : — 
utrum est in clarissimis civibus is, quem... (Flacc. 45), is he among the 
noblest citizens, whom, etc.? 
d. The following table exhibits the various forms of alternative 
questions : —

Nore. — From double (alternative) questions must be distinguished those which are 
in themselves single, but of which some detail is alternative. These have the common 
disjunctive particles aut or vel (-ve). Thus, — quaerd num iniisté aut improbé fécerit 
(Off. iii. 54), I ask whether he acted unjustly or even dishonestly. Here there is no 
double question. The only inquiry is whether the man did either of the two things 
supposed, not which of the two he did.

negatively, the verb, etc., with non or a similar negative : — 
valetne, is he well? valet, yes (he is well). 
eratne técum, was he with you? non erat, no (he was not). 
num quidnam novi? there is nothing new, is there? nihil sané, oh! nothing.

times used to answer a direct question : — 
1. For ves :— 
véro, in truth, true, no doubt, yes. ita vérd, certainly (so in truth), etc. 
etiam, even so, yes, etc. siné quidem, yes, no doubt, etc. 
ita, so, true, etc. ita est, it is so, true, etc.

vidisti an dé audits niintids ?— egomet vidi (Plaut. Merc. 902), did you see 
it or are you repeating something you have heard ? —I saw it myself.

§ 338] CONSTRUCTION OF CASES 209 
CONSTRUCTION OF CASES 
338. The Cases of nouns express their relations to other words in the sentence. 
The most primitive way of expressing such relations was by mere juxtaposition of unin- 
flected forms. From this arose in time composition, i.e. the growing together of stems, 
by means of which a complex expression arises with its parts mutually dependent. 
‘Thus such a complex as armi-gero- came to mean arm-bearing ; fidi-cen-, playing on the 
lyre. Later, Cases were formed by means of suffixes expressing more definitely such 
relations, and Syntax began. But the primitive method of composition still continues 
to hold an important place even in the most highly developed languages. 
Originally the Indo-European family of languages, to which Latin belongs, had at 
least seven case-forms, besides the Vocative. But in Latin the Locative and the Instru- 
mental were lost! except in a few words (where they remained without being recog- 
nized as cases), and their functions were divided among the other cases. 
The Nominative, Accusative, and Vocative express the simplest and perhaps the 
earliest case-relations. The Nominative is the case of the Subject, and generally ends 
in-s. The Vocative, usually without a termination, or like the Nominative (§ 38. a), 
perhaps never had a suffix of itsown.2 The Accusative, most frequently formed by the 
suffix -m, originally connected the noun loosely with the verb-idea, not necessarily 
expressed by a verb proper, but as well by a noun or an adjective (see § 386). 
The Genitive appears to have expressed a great variety of relations and to have 
had no single primitive meaning ; and the same may be true of the Dative. 
The other cases perhaps at first expressed relations of place or direction (To, FROM, 
AT, WITH), though this is not clear in all instances. The zarlier meanings, however, 
have become confused with each other, and in many instances the cases are no longer 
distinguishable in meaning or in form. Thus the Locative was for the most part lost 
from its confusion with the Dative and Ablative; and its function was often performed 
by the Ablative, which is freely used to express the place where (§ 421). To indicate 
the case-relations — especially those of place — more precisely, Prepositions (originally 
adverbs) gradually came into use. The case-endings, thus losing something of their 
significance, were less distinctly pronounced as time went on (see § 36, phonetic decay), 
and prepositions have finally superseded them in the modern languages derived from 
Latin. But in Latin a large and various body of relations was still expressed by case- 
forms. It is to be noticed that in their literal use cases tended to adopt the preposition, 
and in their figurative uses to retain the old construction. (See Ablative of Separation, 
§§ 402404; Ablative of Place and Time, § 421 ff.) 
The word casus, case, is a translation of the Greek rréaus, a falling away (from the 
erect position). The term rréous was originally applied to the Oblique Cases (§ 35. 9), 
to mark them as variations from the Nominative which was called ép0%, erect (casus 
réctus). The later name Nominative (césus néminativus) is from nomind, and means 
the naming case. The other case-names (except Ablative) are of Greek origin. The 
name Genitive (cdsus genetivus) is a translation of -yerix4 [wr Gers], from ‘yévos (class), 
and refers to the class to which a thing belongs. Dative (cdsus dativus, from 46) is 
translated from dorix}, and means the case of giving. Accusative (acciisdtivus, from 
acciisd) is a mistranslation of aircarixy (the case of causing), from airla, cause, and 
meant to the Romans the case of accusing. The name Vocative (vocativus, from vocd) 
is translated from «Aqruch (the case of calling). The name Ablative (ablativus, from 
ablatus, auferd) means taking from. This case the Greek had lost. 
1Some of the endings, however, which in Latin are assigned to the dative and 
ablative are doubtless of locative or instrumental origin (see p. 34, footnote). 
2 The e-yocative of the second declension is a form of the stem (§ 45. ¢).

  210 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [S§ 889-841 
NOMINATIVE CASE 
339. The Subject of a finite verb is in the Nominative : — 
Caesar Rhénum transire décréverat (B. G. iv. 17), Cesar had determined to 
cross the Rhine. 
For the omission of a pronominal subject, see § 295. a. 
a. The nominative may be used in exclamations : — 
én dextra fidésque (Aen. iv. 597), lo, the faith and plighted word! 
ecce tuae litterae dé Varrone (Att. xiii. 16), lo and behold, your letters about 
Varro! 
Norr. — But the accusative is more common (§ 397. d). 
VOCATIVE CASE 
340. The Vocative is the case of direct address: — 
Tiberine pater, té, sancte, precor (Liv. ii. 10), O father Tiber, thee, holy one, 
I pray. 
rés omnis mihi técum erit, Horténsi (Verr. i. 33), my whole. attention will be 
devoted to you, Hortensius. 
a. A noun in the nominative in apposition with the subject of 
the imperative mood is sometimes used instead of the vocative : — 
audi tii, populus Albanus (Liv. i. 24), hear, thou people of Alba. 
b. The vocative of an adjective is sometimes used in poetry instead 
of the nominative, where the verb is in the second person : — 
quo moritiire ruis (Aen. x. 811), whither art thou rushing to thy doom? 
cénsorem trabeate saliitas (Pers. iii. 29), robed you salute the censor. 
c. The vocative macte is used as a predicate in the phrase macte 
estd (virtiite), success attend your (valor): — 
iubérem té macte virtiite esse (Liv. ii. 12), I should bid you go on and prosper — 
in your valor. 
macte nova virtiite puer (Aen. ix. 641), success attend your valor, boy! 
Nors.— As the original quantity of the final e in macte is not determinable, it may 
be that the word was an adverb, as in bene est and the like. 
GENITIVE CASE 
341. The Genitive is regularly used to express the relation of 
one noun to another. Hence it is sometimes called the adjective 
case, to distinguish it from the Dative and the Ablative, which 
may be called adverbial cases.

  §§ 341-343] POSSESSIVE GENITIVE 211 
  
The uses of the Genitive may be classified as follows: 
1. Of Possession (§ 343). 
2. Of Material (§ 344). 
3. Of Quality (§ 345). 
4. Of the Whole, after words designating a Part 
(Partitive, § 346). 
5. With Nouns of Action and Feeling (§ 348).

Sere Te NLM Vonnay Of Accusing, ete. (Charge or Penalty) (§ 352). 
GENITIVE WITH NOUNS 
342. A noun used to limit or define another, and not meaning 
the same person or thing, is put in the Genitive. 
This relation is most frequently expressed in English by the prepo- 
sition of, sometimes by the English genitive (or possessive) case : — 
libri Cicerdnis, the books of Cicero, or Cicero’s books. 
inimici Caesaris, Cwsar’s enemies, or the enemies of Cesar. 
talentum auri, a talent of gold. 
vir summae virtitis, a man of the greatest courage. 
But observe the following equivalents : — 
yacatid laboris, a respite rrom toil. 
petitis cénsulatiis, candidacy ror the consulship. 
régnum civitatis, royal power over the state. 
Possessive Genitive 
343. The Possessive Genitive denotes the person or thing to 
-which an object, quality, feeling, or action belongs: — 
Alexandri canis, Alexander’s dog. 
potentia Pompéi (Sall. Cat. 19), Pompey’s power. 
Ariovisti mors (B. G. v. 29), the death of Ariovistus. 
perditérum temeritas (Mil. 22), the recklessness of desperate men. 
Notr 1.—The Possessive Genitive may denote (1) the actual owner (as in Alex- 
ander’s dog) or author (as in Cicero’s writings), or (2) the person or thing that possesses 
some feeling or quality or does some act (as in Cicero’s eloquence, the strength of the 
bridge, Catiline’s evil deeds). In the latter use it is sometimes called the Subjective 
Genitive; but this term properly includes the possessive genitive and several other 
genitive constructions (nearly all, in fact, except the Objective Genitive, § 347). 
Nore 2.— The noun limited is understood in a few expressions: — 
ad Castoris [aedés] (Quinct. 17), at the [temple] of Castor. [Cf. St. Paul’s.] 
Flaccus Claudi, Flaceus [slave] of Claudius. 
Hectoris Andromaché (Aen. iii. 319), Heetor’s [wife] Andromache.

  212 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [§ 348 
a. For the genitive of possession a possessive or derivative adjec- 
tive is often used, — regularly for the possessive genitive of the per- 
sonal pronouns (§ 302. a): — 
liber meus, my book. [Not liber mei.] 
aliéna pericula, other men’s dangers. [But also alidrum. ] 
Sullana tempora, the times of Sulla. [Oftener Sullae.] 
b. The possessive genitive often stands in the predicate, connected 
with its noun by a verb (Predicate Genitive): — 
haec domus est patris mei, this house is my father’s. 
jam mé Pompéi totum esse scis (Fam. ii. 18), you know I am now all for Pom- 
pey (all Pompey’s). 
summa laus et tua et Briti est (Fam. xii. 4. 2), the highest praise is due both 
to you and to Brutus (is both yours and Brutus’s). 
compendi facere, to save (make of saving). 
lucri facere, to get the benefit of (make of profit). 
Nore. —These genitives bear the same relation to the examples in § 343 that a 
predicate noun bears to an appositive (§§ 282, 283). 
ec. An infinitive or a clause, when used as a noun, is often limited 
by a genitive in the predicate : — 
.  heque sui itidici [erat] discernere (B. C. i. 35), nor was it for his judgment to 
decide (nor did it belong to his judgment). 
ciiusvis hominis est errdre (Phil. xii. 5), it is any man’s [liability] to err. 
negavit moris esse Graecdrum, ut in convivid virdrum accumberent mulierés 
(Verr. ii. 1. 66), he said it was not the custom of the Greeks for women to 
appear as guests (recline) at the banquets of men. 
sed timidi est optare necem (Ov. M. iv. 115), but ’tis the coward’s part to 
wish for death. 
stulti erat spérare, suddére impudentis (Phil. ii. 23), it was folly (the part of 
a fool) to hope, effrontery to urge. 
sapientis est pauca loqui, it is wise (the part of a wise man) to say little. 
[Not sapiéns (neuter) est, etc.] 
Nore 1.— This construction is regular with adjectives of the third declension 
instead of the neuter nominative (see the last two examples). 
Nore 2.—A derivative or possessive adjective may be used for the genitive in this 
construction, and must be used for the genitive of a personal pronoun: — 
mentiri n6n est meum [not mei], it is not for me to lie. 
hiim4num [for hominis] est errare, it is man’s nature to err (to err is human). 
d. A limiting genitive is sometimes used instead of anoun in appo- 
sition (Appositional Genitive) (§ 282): — - 
ndmen insaniae (for ndmen insAnia), the word madness. 
oppidum Antiochiae (for oppidum Antiochia, the regular form), the city of 
Antioch.

  §§ 344-346] PARTITIVE GENITIVE 213 
Genitive of Material 
344, The Genitive may denote the Substance or Material of 
which a thing consists (cf. § 403): — 
talentum auri, a talent of gold. fiimina lactis, rivers of milk. 
Genitive of Quality 
345. The Genitive is used to denote Quality, but only when 
the quality is modified by an adjective : — 
vir summae virtitis, a man of the highest courage. [But not vir virtitis.] 
magnae est déliberatidnis, it is an affair of great deliberation. 
magni formica laboris (Hor. S. i. 1. 33), the ant [a creature] of great toil. 
ille autem sui ididici (Nep. Att. 9), but he [a man] of independent (his own) 
judgment. 
Norz. — Compare Ablative of Quality (§ 415). In expressions of quality, the geni- 
tive or the ablative may often be used indifferently: as, praestanti priidentia vir, a 
man of surpassing wisdom ; maximi animi homd, a man of the greatest courage. In 
classic prose, however, the genitive of quality is much less common than the abla- 
tive; it is practically confined to expressions of measure or number, to a phrase with 
éius, and to nouns modified by m&gnus, maximus, summus, or tantus. In general the 
Genitive is used rather of essential, the Ablative of special or incidental characteristics. 
a. The genitive of quality is found in the adjective phrases éius 
modi, ciius modi (equivalent to talis, such ; qualis, of what sort):— 
éius modi sunt tempestatés consectitae, uti (B. G. iii. 29), such storms fol- 
lowed, that, etc. 
b. The genitive of quality, with numerals, is used to define meas- 
ures of length, depth, etc. (Genitive of Measure): — 
fossa trium pedum, a trench of three feet [in depth]. 
miirus sédecim pedum, a wall of sixteen feet [high]. 
For the Genitive of Quality used to express indefinite value, see § 417.

pars militum, part of the soldiers. quis nostrum, which of us? 
nihil erat reliqui, there was nothing left.

8. Neuter Adjectives and Pronouns, used as nouns : — 
tantum spati, so much [of] space. 
aliquid nummirum, a few pence (something of coins). 
id loci (or locdrtim), that spot of ground; id temporis, at that time (§ 397. a). 
plana urbis, the level parts of the town. 
quid novi, what news? (what of new?) 
paulum frimenti.(B. C. i. 78), a little grain. 
pliis doloris (B. G. i. 20), more grief. 
suialiquid timiris (B.C. ii. 29), some fear of his own (something of his own fear). 
Nore 1.—In classic prose neuter adjectives (not pronominal) seldom take a parti- 
  tive genitive, except multum, tantum, quantum, and similar words. 
Nore 2.— The genitive of adjectives of the third declension is rarely used parti- 
tively :—nihil novi (genitive), nothing new ; but, —nihil memorabile (nominative), noth- 
ing worth mention (not nihil memorabilis). 
4, Adverbs, especially those of Quantity and of Place : — 
parum oti, not much ease (too little of ease). 
satis peciiniae, money enough (enough of money). 
plirimum totius Galliae equitati valet (B. G. v. 3), is strongest of all Gaul 
in cavalry. 
ubinam gentium sumus (Cat. i. 9), where in the world are we (where of 
nations) ? 
ubicumque terrarum et gentium (Verr. yv. 143), wherever in the whole world. 
rés erat ed iam loci ut (Sest. 68), the business had now reached such a point 
that, etc. 
e5 miseridrum (Iug. 14. 3), to that [pitch] of misery. 
inde ‘loci, neat in order (thence of place). [Poetical.] 
b. The poets and later writers often use the partitive genitive 
after adjectives, instead of a noun in its proper case : — 
sequimur té, sancte dedrum (Aen. iv. 576), we follow thee, O holy deity. [For 
sancte deus (§ 49. g. n.)] 
nigrae lanarum (Plin. H. N. viii. 193), black wools. [For nigrae lanae. ] 
expediti militum (Liv. xxx. 9), light-armed soldiers. [For expediti milités. ] 
hominum ciinctds (Oy. M. iv. 631), all men. [For cinctés hominés ; cf. e.]
-P-A-G-E-227
  §§ 346-348] OBJECTIVE GENITIVE 215 
c. Cardinal numerals (except milia) regularly take the Ablative 
with é (ex) or dé instead of the Partitive Genitive. So also quidam, 
a certain one, commonly, and other words occasionally : — 
unus ex tribiinis, one of the tribunes. [But also, finus tribindrum (cf. a. 2).] 
minumus ex illis (Iug. 11), the youngest of them. 
medius ex tribus (ib.), the middle one of the three. 
quidam ex militibus, certain of the soldiers. 
iinus dé multis (Fin. ii. 66), one of the many. 
pauci dé nostris cadunt (B. G. i. 15), a few of our men fall. 
hominem dé comitibus meis, a man of my companions. 
d, Uterque, both (properly each), and quisque, each, with Nouns 
are regularly used as adjectives in agreement, but with Pronouns 
take a partitive genitive : — 
uterque consul, both the consuls; but, uterque nostrum, both of us. 
iinus quisque vestrum, each one of you. 
utraque castra, both camps. 
e. Numbers and words of quantity including the whole of any 
thing take a case in agreement, and not the partitive genitive. So 
also words denoting a part when only that part is thought of :— 
nds omnés, all of us (we all). [Not omnés nostrum. ] 
quot sunt hostés, how many of the enemy are there? 
cavé inimicds, qui multi sunt, beware of your enemies, who are many. 
multi milités, many of the soldiers. 
ném6 Romanus, not one Roman. 
Objective Genitive 
347. The Objective Genitive is used with Nouns, Adjectives, 
and Verbs. 
348. Nouns of action, agency, and feeling govern the Genitive 
of the Object : — 
caritas tui, affection for you. désiderium oti, longing for rest. 
vacatid mineris, relief from duty. gratia benefici, gratitude for kindness. 
fuga malorum, refuge from disaster.  precatid dedrum, prayer to the gods. 
contentid honérum, struggle for office. opinid virtitis, reputation for valor. 
Nore. —This usage is an extension of the idea of belonging to (Possessive Genitive). 
Thus in the phrase odium Caesaris, hate of Cxsar, the hate in a passive sense belongs 
to Cxsar, as odium, though in its active sense he is the object of it, as hate (cf. a). 
The distinction between the Possessive (subjective) and the Objective Genitive is very 
unstable and is often lost sight of. It is illustrated by the following example: the 
phrase amor patris, love of a father, may mean love felt by a father, a father’s love 
(subjective genitive), or love towards a father (objective genitive).

  216 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [ss 848, 349 
a. The objective genitive is sometimes replaced by a ee 
pronoun or other derivative adjective: — 
mea invidia, my unpopularity (the dislike of which I am the Sbies [Cf 
odium mei (Har. Resp. 5), hatred of me.] 
lJaudator meus (Att. i. 16. 5), my eulogist (one who praises me). [Cf. nostri 
laudator (id. i. 14. 6).] 
Clédianum crimen (Mil. 72), the murder of Clodius (the Clodian charge). [As

neque neglegentia tua, neque id odio fécit tud (Ter. Ph. 1016), he did this 
neither from neglect nor from hatred of you. 
b. Rarely the objective genitive is used with a noun already lim- 
ited by another genitive : — 
animi multarum rérum percursi6 (Tusc. iv. 31), the mind’s traversing of many 
things. 
e. A noun with a preposition is often used instead of the objec- 
tive genitive : — 
odium in Anténium (Fam. x. 5. 3), hate of Antony. 
merita erga mé (id. i. 1. 1), services to me. 
meam in té pietaitem (id. i. 9. 1), my devotion to you.

and bold extension of this construction.] 5 
Norsr.—So also in late writers the dative of reference (cf. § 366. ): as,— longo 
bellé materia (Tac. H. i. 89), resources for a long war. 
GENITIVE WITH ADJECTIVES 
349. Adjectives requiring an object of reference govern the 
Objective Genitive. 
a. Adjectives denoting desire, knowledge, memory, fulness, power, 
sharing, guilt, and their opposites govern the genitive: — 
avidi laudis (Manil. 7), greedy of praise. 
fastididsus litterarum, disdaining letters. 
ifris peritus, skilled in law. [So also the ablative, idire, cf. § 418.] 
memorem vestri, oblitum sui (Cat. iv. 19), mindful of you, forgetful of himself. 
ratidnis et dratidnis expertés (Off. i. 50), devoid of sense and speech.

tempestatum potentem (Aen. i. 80), having sway over the storms. 
impoténs irae (Liv. xxix. 9. 9), ungovernable in anger.

affinis rei capitalis (Verr. ii. 2. 94), involved in a capital crime. 
insOns culpae (Liv. xxii. 49), innocent of guilt. 
b. Participles in -ns govern the genitive when they are used as 
adjectives, ic. when they denote a constant disposition and not a 
particular act : — 
sI quem tui amantidrem cdgnovisti (Q. Fr. i. 1. 15), if you have become 
acquainted with any one more fond of you. 
multitiid6 insoléns belli (B. C. ii. 36), a crowd unused to war. 
erat Iugurtha appeténs gloriae militaris (lug. 7), Jugurtha was eager for mili- 
tary glory. 
Nore 1.— Participles in -ns, when used as participles, take the case regularly goy- 
erned by the verb to which they belong: as,—Sp. Maelium régnum appetentem inter- 
émit (Cat. M. 56), he put to death Spurius Melius, who was aspiring to royal power. 
Nore 2.— Occasionally participial forms in -ns are treated as participles (see note 1) 
even when they express a disposition or character: as,— virtiis quam alii ipsam tem- 
perantiam dicunt esse, alii obtemperantem temperantiae praeceptis et eam subsequen- 
tem (Tusce. iv. 30), observant of the teachings of temperance and obedient to her. 
c. Verbals in -ax (§ 251) govern the genitive in poetry and later 
Latin: — 
ifistum et tenadcem propositi virum (Hor. Od. iii. 3), a man just and steadfast 
to his-purpose. 
circus Capax populi (Oy. A. A. i. 136), a circus big enough to hold the people. 
cibi vinique capacissimus (Liv. ix. 16. 13), a very great eater and drinker 
(very able to contain food and wine). 
d. The poets and later writers use the genitive with almost any 
adjective, to denote that with reference to which the quality exists 
(Genitive of Specification) : — 
callidus rei militaris (Tac. H. ii. 32), skilled in soldiership. 
pauper aquae (Hor. Od. iii. 80. 11), scant of water. 
nodtus animi paterni (id. ii. 2. 6), famed for a paternal spirit. 
fessi rérum (Aen. i. 178), weary of toil. 
integer vitae scelerisque purus (Hor. Od. i. 22. 1), upright in life, and unstained 
by guilt. 
Norr. — The Genitive of Specification is only an extension of the construction with 
adjectives requiring an object of reference (§ 349). Thus callidus denotes knowledge ; 
pauper, want; piirus, innocence; and so these words in a manner belong to the classes 
under a. : 
For the Ablative of Specification, the prose construction, see § 418. For Adjectives 
of likeness etc. with the Genitive, apparently Objective, see § 385. c. For Adjectives 
with animi (locative in origin), see § 358.

GENITIVE WITH VERBS 
Verbs of Remembering and Forgetting 
350. Verbs of remembering and forgetting take either the Accu- 
sative or the Genitive of the object: — 
a. Memini takes the Accusative when it has the literal sense of 
retaining in the mind what one has seen, heard, or learned. Hence 
the accusative is used of persons whom one remembers as acquaint- 
ances, or of things which one has experienced. 
So obliviscor in the opposite sense, — to forget literally, to lose ail. 
memory of a thing (very rarely, of a person). 
Cinnam memini (Phil. v. 17), I remember Cinna. 
utinam avum tuum meminissés (id. i. 34), oh! that you could remember your 
grandfather ! (but he died before you were born). 
Postumium, cflius statuam in Isthm6 meminisse té dicis (Att. xiii. 82), Postu- 
mius, whose statue you say you remember (to have seen) on the Isthmus. 
omnia meminit Siron Epiciri dogmata (Acad. ii. 106), Siron remembers all 
the doctrines of Epicurus. 
multa ab aliis audita meminérunt (De Or. ii. 855), they remember many things 
that they have heard from others. 
totam causam oblitus est (Brut. 217), he forgot the whole case. 
hine iam obliviscere Graids (Aen. ii. 148), from henceforth forget the Greeks 
(i.e. not merely disregard them, but banish them from your mind, as rs 
you had never known them). 
b. Memini takes the Genitive when it means to be mindful or 
regardful of a person or thing, to think of somebody or something 
(often with special interest or warmth of feeling). 
So obliviscor in the opposite sense, — to disregard, or dismiss from 
the mind,—and the adjective oblitus, careless or regardless. 
ipse sui meminerat (Verr. ii. 136), he was mindful of himself (of his own 
interests). 
faciam ut hfiius loci difique m&que semper memineris (Ter. Eun. 801), Z will 
make you remember this place and this day and me as long as you live. 
nec mé meminisse pigébit Elissae, dum memor ipse mei (Aen. iv. 385), nor 
shall I feel regret at the thought of Elissa, so long as I remember myself. 
meminerint verécundiae (Off. i. 122), let them cherish modesty. 
himanae infirmitatis memini (Liv. xxx. 31. 6), [remember human weakness. 
oblivisci temporum medrum, meminisse actidnum (Fam. i. 9, 8), to disregard 
my own interests, to be mindful of the matters at issue. 
nec tamen Epiciiri licet oblivisci (Fin. v. 3), and yet I must not forget Epicurus. 
obliviscere caedis atque incendidrum (Cat. i.6), turn your mind from slaughter 
and conflagrations (dismiss them from your thoughts).
-P-A-G-E-231
  §§ 850, 351] GENITIVE WITH VERBS 219 
Note 1.— With both memini and obliviscor the personal and reflexive pronouns are 
regularly in the Genitive; neuter pronouns and adjectives used substantively are regu- 
Jarly in the Accusative; abstract nouns are often in the Genitive. These uses come 
in each instance from the natural meaning of the verbs (as defined above). 
Nore 2.—Memini in the sense of mention takes the Genitive: as,—eundem Achil- 
lam céius supra meminimus (B. C. iii. 108), that same Achillas whom I mentioned 
above. 
ce. Reminiscoris rare. It takes the Accusative in the literal sense 
of call to mind, recollect ; the Genitive in the more figurative sense 
of be mindful of : — 
dulcis moriéns reminiscitur Argds (Aen. x. 782), as he dies he calls to mind 
his beloved Argos. 
reminiscerétur et veteris incommodi populi Romani et pristinae virtiitis Helvé- 
tidrum (B. G. i. 18), let him remember both the former discomfiture of the 
Roman people and the ancient valor of the Helvetians. [A warning, — 
let him bear it in mind (and beware)! ] 
d. Recordor, recollect, recall, regularly takes the Accusative : — 
recordare cénsénsum illum theatri (Phil. i. 80), recall that unanimous agree- 
ment of the [audience in the] theatre. 
recordamini omnis civilis dissénsiénés (Cat. iii. 24), call to mind all the civil 
wars. 
Nore. — Recordor takes the genitive once (Pison. 12); it is never used with a per- 
sonal object, but may be followed by dé with the ablative of the person or thing 
(cf. § 351. N.) :— 
dé té recordor (Scaur. 49), I remember about you. 
dé illis (lacrimis) recordor (Plane. 104), J am reminded of those tears. 
Verbs of Reminding 
351. Verbs of reminding take with the Accusative of the per- 
son a Genitive of the thing; except in the case of a neuter pro- 
noun, which is put in the accusative (cf. § 390. ¢). 
So admoned, commoned, commonefacid, commonefid. But moned with 
the genitive is found in late writers only. 
Catilina admonébat alium egestatis, alium cupiditatis suae (Sall. Cat. 21), 
Catiline reminded one of his poverty, another of his cupidity. 
eds hdc moned (Cat. ii. 20), I give them this warning. 
quod vos 1éx commonet (Verr. iii. 40), that which the law reminds you of. 
Norg. — All these verbs often take dé with the ablative, and the accusative of nouns 
as well as of pronouns is sometimes used with them :— 
sagpius té admoned dé syngrapha Sittiana (Fam. viii. 4. 5) Iremind you again and 
again of Sittius’s bond. 
officium yostrum ut vos mald cdgatis commonérier (Plaut. Ps. 150), that you may 
by misfortune force yourselves to be reminded of your duty.

Verbs of Accusing, Condemning, and Acquitting 
852. Verbs of accusing, condemning, and acquitting, take the 
Genitive of the Charge or Penalty : — 
arguit mé furti, he accuses me of theft. 
peciilatis damnatus (peciiniae piiblicae damnatus) (Flacc. 48), condemned for 
embezzlement. 
vided non té absoliitum esse improbitatis, sed ills damnatés esse caedis 
(Verr. ii. 1. 72), I see, not that you were acquitted of outrage, but that 
they were condemned for homicide. 
a. Peculiar genitives, under this construction, are — 
capitis, as in damnére capitis, to sentence to death. 
maiestatis [laesae], treason (crime against the dignity of the state). 
repetundarum [rérum], extortion (lit. of an action for reclaiming money). 
voti damnatus (or reus), bownd [to the payment] of one’s vow, i.e. success- 
ful in one’s effort. 
peciiniae (damnare, iiidicare, see note). 
dupli etc., as in dupli condemnare, condemn to pay twofold. 
Norr.—The origin of these genitive constructions is pointed at by peciiniae dam- 
nare (Gell. xx. 1. 38), to condemn to pay money, in a case of injury to the person; 
quantae peciiniae iiidicati essent (id.xx.1.47),how much money they were adjudged to pay, 
. in a mere suit for debt; cinfessi aeris ac débiti ifidicdti (id. xx. 1. 42), adjudged to owe 
an admitted sum due. These expressions show that the genitive of the penalty comes 
from the use of the genitive of value to express a sum of money due either as a debt or as 
afine. Since in early civilizations all offences could be compounded by the payment of 
fines, the genitive came to be used of other punishments, not pecuniary. From this to 
the genitive of the actual crime is an easy transition, inasmuch as there is always a 
confusion between crime and penalty (cf. Eng. guilty of death). Itis quite unnecessary 
to assume an ellipsis of crimine or itidici6. F 
353. Other constructions for the Charge or Penalty are — 
1. The Ablative of Price: regularly of a definite amount of fine, 
and often of indefinite penalties (cf. § 416):— 
Frusinatés tertia parte agri damnati (Liv. x. 1), the people of Frusino con- 
demned [to forfeit] a third part of their land. 
2. The Ablative with dé, or the Accusative with inter, in idiomatic 
expressions : — 
dé alea, for gambling ; dé ambitii, for bribery. 
dé peciiniis repetundis, of extortion (cf. § 352. a). 
inter sicdrids (Rose. Am. 90), as an assassin (among the assassins). 
dé vi et maiestatis damnati (Phil. i. 21), convicted of assault and treason. 
Norg.— The accusative with ad and in occurs in later writers to express the pen- 
alty: as,—ad mortem (Tac. Ann. xvi. 21), to death; ad (in) metalla, to the mines.

Verbs of Feeling 
354, Many verbs of feeling take the Genitive of the object 
which excites the feeling. 
a. Verbs of pity, as misereor and miseréscd, take the genitive : — 
miserémini familiae, iiidicés, miserémini patris, miserémini fili (Flace. 106), 
have pity on the family, ete. 
miserére animi nén digna ferentis (Aen. ii. 144), pity-a soul that endures 
unworthy things. 
miseréscite régis (id. viii. 578), pity the king. [Poetical.] 
Norr.— But miseror, commiseror, bewail, take the accusative: as,—commiinem 
condiciénem miserari (Mur. 55), bewail the common lot. 
6. As impersonals, miseret, paenitet, piget, pudet, taedet (or pertaesum 
est), take the genitive of the cause of the feeling and the accusative 
of the person affected :— 
quis infamiae suae neque pudet neque taedet (Verr. i. 35), who are netthas 
ashamed nor weary of their dishonor. 
mé miseret parietum ipsdrum (Phil. ii. 69), I pity the very walls. 
mé civitatis mérum piget taedetque (Iug. 4), I am sick and tired of the way: 
of the state. 
decemvirérum vos pertaesum est (Liv. iii. 67), you became tired of the decemvus 
c. With miseret, paenitet, etc., the cause of the feeling may be ex : 
‘pressed by an infinitive or a clause : — 
neque mé paenitet mortalis inimicitias habére (Rab. Post. 32), nor am I sorry 
to have deadly enmities. 
non dedisse istunc pudet; mé quia non accépi piget (Pl. Pseud. 282), he is 
ashamed not to have given; I am sorry because I have not received. 
Nore. — Miseret etc. are sometimes used personally with a neuter pronoun as sub- 
ject: as, —no6n té haec pudent (Ter. Ad. 754), do not these things shame you? 
Interest and Réfert 
355. The impersonals interest and réfert take the Genitive of 
the person (rarely of the thing) affected. 
The subject of the verb is a neuter pronoun or a substantive 
clause : — 
Clédi intererat Mildnem perire (cf. Mil. 56), it was the interest of Clodius that 
Milo should die. 
aliquid quod illérum magis quam sua rétulisse vidérétur (Iug. 111), something 
which seemed to be more for their interest than his own. 
vided enim quid mea intersit, quid utriusque nostrum (Fam. vii. 23. 4), for I 
see what is for my good and for the good of us both.

a. Instead of the genitive of a personal pronoun the correspond-

or réfert : — 
quid tua id réfert ? magni (Ter. Ph. 723), how does that concern you? much. 
[See also the last two examples above. } 
yehementer intererat vestra qui patrés estis (Plin. Ep. iv. 18. 4), it would be 
very much to your advantage, you who are fathers. 
Norr. —This is the only construction with réfert in classic prose, except in one 
passage in Sallust (see example above). E 
b. The accusative with ad is used with interest and réfert to ex- 
press the thing with reference to which one is interested : — 
magni ad hondrem nostrum interest (Fam. xvi. 1), it is of great conactuencg 
to our honor. 
réfert etiam ad frictis (Varr. R. R. i. 16. 6), it makes a difference as to the orn 
Nore 1.— Very rarely the person is expressed by ad and the accusative, or (with 
réfert) by the dative (probably a popular corruption): — 
quid id ad mé aut ad meam rem réfert (Pl. Pers. 513), what difference does that 
make to me or to my interests? 
quid réferat intra natiirae finis viventi (Hor. 8. i. 1. 49), what difference does it 
make to me who live within the limits of natural desire? 
non réferre dédecori (Tac. Ann. xv. 65), that it makes no difference as to the 
disgrace. 
Nore 2.—The degree of interest is expressed by a genitive of value, an adverb, 
or an adverbial accusative. 
    Verbs of Plenty and Want 
356. Verbs of Plenty and Want sometimes govern the a 
tive (cf. § 409. a.N.): 
conyivium vicindrum compleé (Cat. M. 46, in the mouth of Cato), I fill up the 
banquet with my neighbors. 
implentur veteris Bacchi pinguisque ferinae (Aen. i. 215), they fill themselves 
with old wine and fat venison. 
né quis auxili egeat (B. G. vi. 11), lest any require aid. 
quid est quod défénsidnis indigeat (Rosc. Am. 34), what is there that needs 
defence? 
quae ad cdnsdlandum miairis ingeni et ad ferendum singularis virtitis indi- 
gent (Fam. vi. 4. 2), [sorrows] which for their comforting need more abil- 
ity, and for endurance unusual courage. 
Nore. — Verbs of plenty and want more commonly take the ablative (see §§ 409. a, 
401), except eged, which takes either case, and indiged. But the genitive is by a Greek 
idiom often used in poetry instead of the ablative with all words denoting separation 
and want (cf. § 357. b. 3):— 
abstinét6 irarum (Hor. Od. iii. 27. 69), refrain from wrath. 
operum soliitis (id. iii. 17. 16), free from toils.

always in the phrase potiri rérum, to be master of affairs : — 
illius régni potiri (Fam. i. 7. 5), to become master of that kingdom. 
Cleanthés sdlem dominari et rérum potiri putat (Acad. ii. 126), Cleanthes

his justice or his toils in war? 
neque ille sépositi ciceris nec longae invidit avénae (Hor. S. ii. 6. 84), nor did 
he grudge his garnered peas, etc. [But cf. invidus, parcus.] 
laborum ‘décipitur (Hor. Od. ii. 13. 38), he is beguiled of his woes. 
mé laborum levis (Pl. Rud. 247), you relieve me of my troubles. 
358. The apparent Genitive animi (really Locative) is used with 
a few verbs and adjectives of feeling and the like: — 
Antiphd mé excruciat animi (Ter. Ph. 187), Antipho tortures my mind (me in 
my mind). 
qui pendet animi (Tusc. iv. 35), who is in. suspense. 
mé animi fallit (Lucr. i. 922), my mind deceives me. 
So, by analogy, désipiébam mentis (Pl. Epid. 188), I was out of my head. 
aeger animi, sick at heart; cOnfiisus animi, disturbed in spirit. 
~ sanus mentis aut animi (Pl. Trin. 454), sound in mind or heart. 
  PECULIAR GENITIVES 
359. Peculiar Genitive constructions are the following: — 
a. A poetical genitive occurs rarely in exclamations, in imitation 
of the Greek (Genitive of Exclamation) : — 
di immortalés, mercimoni lepidi (P1. Most. 912), good heavens! what a charm- 
ing bargain! 
foederis heu taciti (Prop. iv. 7. 21), alas for the unspoken agreement!

2294 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [s§ 859, 360 
b. The genitive is often used with the ablatives causa, gratia, for 
the sake of; ergs, because of; and the indeclinable instar, like; also 
with pridié, the day before; postridié, the day after; tenus, as far as: 
hondris causa, with due respect (for the sake of honor). 
verbi gratia, for example. 
éius légis ergd, on account of this law. : 
equus instar montis (Aen. ii, 15), a horse huge as a mountain (the image of 
a mountain). 
laterum tenus (id. x. 210), as far as the sides. 
Nore 1.— Of these the genitive with causé is a development from the possessive 
genitive and resembles that in ndmen insaniae (§ 343.d). The others are of various origin. 
Norr 2.—In prose of the Republican Period pridié and postridié are thus used only 
in the expressions pridié (postridié) éius diéi, the day before (after) that (cf. “the eve, the 
morrow ofthat day”). Tacitus uses the construction with other words: as, —postridié 
insidiarum, the day after the plot. For the accusative, see § 432. a. Tenus takes also 
the ablative (p. 136).    
DATIVE CASE 
360. The Dative is probably, like the Genitive, a grammatical case, that is, it is 
a form appropriated to the expression of a variety of relations other than that of the 
direct object. But it is held by some to be a Locative with the primary meaning of 
to or towards, and the poetic uses (like it clamor caelé, Aen. y. 451) are regarded as 
survivals of the original use. 
In Latin the Dative has two classes of meanings: — 
1. The Dative denotes an object not as caused by the action, or directly affected by 
it (like the Accusative), but as reciprocally sharing in the action or receiving it con- 
sciously or actively. Thus in dedit puerd librum, he gave the boy a book, or fécit mihi 
initiriam, he did me a wrong, there is an idea of the boy’s receiving the book, and of my 
feeling the wrong. Hence expressions denoting persons, or things with personal 
attributes, are more likely to be in the dative than those denoting mere things. So 
in Spanish the dative is used whenever a person is the object of an action; yo veo al 
hombre, I see [to] the man. This difference between the Accusative and the Dative 
(i.e. between the Direct and the Indirect Object) depends upon the point of view implied 
in the verb or existing in the mind of the writer. Hence Latin verbs of similar meaning 
(to an English mind) often differ in the case of their object (see § 367. a). 
2. The Dative is used to express the purpose of an action or that for which it serves 
(see § 382). This construction is especially used with abstract expressions, or those 
implying an action. 
These two classes of Datives approach each other in some cases and are occasion- 
ally confounded, as in §§ 383, 384. 
The uses of the Dative are the following: — 
1. Indirect Object (general { 1. With Transitives (§ 362). 
use): 2. With Intransitives (§§ 366-372). 
{ 1. Of Possession (with esse) (§ 373). 
| 2. Of Agency (with Gerundive) (§ 374). 
2, Special or Idiomatic Uses: 1 3. Of Reference (dativus commodi) (§§ 376-381). 
4. Of Purpose or End (predicate use) (§ 382). 
5. Of Fitness ete. (with Adjectives) (§§ 383, 384).
-P-A-G-E-237
  §§ 861-363] DATIVE OF INDIRECT OBJECT 225 
INDIRECT OBJECT 
361. The Dative is used to denote the object indirectly affected 
by an action. 
This is called the Indirect Object (§ 274). It is usually denoted 
in English by the objective with to : — 
cédite tempori, yield to the occasion. 
provincia Ciceréni obtigit, the province fell by lot to Cicero. 
inimicis n6n crédimus, we do not trust [to] our enemies. 
INDIRECT OBJECT WITH TRANSITIVES 
362. The Dative of the Indirect Object with the Accusative 
of the Direct may be used with any transitive verb whose mean- 
ing allows (see § 274): — 
dé tibi librum, I give you a book. 
illud tibi affirms (Fam. i. 7. 5), this I assure you. 
commend tibi éius omnia negotia (id. i. 3), I put all his affairs in your hands 
(commit them to you). 
dabis profect6 misericordiae quod irdcundiae negavisti (Deiot. 40), you will 
surely grant to mercy what you refused to wrath. 
litterds 4 té mihi stator tuus reddidit (Fam. ii. 17), your messenger delivered 
to me a letter from you. 
a. Many verbs have both a transitive and an intransitive use, and 
take either the Accusative with the Dative, or the Dative alone : — 
mihi id aurum crédidit (cf. Plaut. Aul. 15), he trusted that gold to me. 
equd né crédite (Aen. ii. 48), put not your trust in the horse. 
concessit senatus postulatidni tuae (Mur. 47), the senate yielded to your demand. 
concédere amicis quidquid velint (Lael. 88), to grant to friends all they may 
wish. 
363. Certain verbs implying motion vary in their construction 
between the Dative of the Indirect Object and the Accusative 
of the End of Motion (§§ 426, 427): — 
1. Some verbs implying motion take the Accusative (usually with 
ad or in) instead of the Indirect Object, when the idea of motion pre- 
vails: — 
litteras quas ad Pompéium scripsi (Att. iii. 8. 4), the letter which I have written 
[and sent] to Pompey. [Cf. ndn quo habérem quod tibi scriberem (id. 
iv. 44), not that I had anything to write to you.]
-P-A-G-E-238
  226 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES _ [§§ 363, 364 
litterae extempld Romam scriptae (Liv. xli. 16), a letter was immediately written

hostis in fugam dat (B. G. v. 51), he puts the enemy to flight. [Cf. ut médem 
fugae (Att. vii. 23), to take to flight.] 
omnés rem ad Pompéium déferri volunt (Fam. i. 1), all wish the matter to be 
put in the hands of Pompey (referred to Pompey). 
2. On the other hand, many verbs of motion usually followed by 
the Accusative with ad or in, take the Dative when the idea of motion 
is merged in some other idea : — 
mihi litterds mittere (Fam. vii. 12), to send me a letter. 
eum librum tibi misi (id. vii. 19), I sent you that book. 
nec quicquam quod non mihi Caesar détulerit (id. iv. 13), and nothing which 
Cesar did not communicate to me. 
ciirés ut mihi vehantur (id. viii. 4. 5), take care that they be conveyed to me. 
cum alius alii subsidium ferrent (B. G. ii. 26), while one lent aid to another. 
364, Certain verbs may take either the Dative of the person and 
the Accusative of the thing, or (in a different me) the ecuesiaye 
of the person and the Ablative of the thing?: 
dodnat cordnds suis, he presents wreaths to his men; or, 
ddnat suds cordnis, he presents his men with wreaths. 
vincula exuere sibi (Ov. M. vii. 772), to shake off the leash (from himself). 
omnis armis exuit (B. G. v. 51), he stripped them all of their arms, 
Nore 1. —Interdicé, forbid, takes either (1) the Dative of the person and the Abla- 
tive of the thing, or (2) in later writers, the Dative of the person and the Accusative of 
the thing: 
aqua et ignialicui interdicere, to forbid one the use of fireand water. [The regular 
formula for banishment.] 
interdixit histridnibus scaenam (Suet. Dom. 7), he forbade the actors [to appear on] 
the stage (he prohibited the stage to the actors). 
féminis (dat.) purpurae isi interdicémus (Liv. xxxiv. 7), shall we forbid women 
the wearing of purple? 
Nors 2.— The Dative with the Accusative is used in poetry with many verbs of 
preventing, protecting, and the like, which usually take the Accusative and Ablative. 
Intercliidd and prohibed sometimes take the Dative and Accusative, even in prose : — 
hisce omnis aditiis ad Sullam intercliidere (Rose. Am. 110), to shut these men off 
Srom all access to Sulla (close to them every approach). [Cf. uti commeati 
Caesarem interclideret (B. G. i. 48), to shut Cesar off from supplies.) 
hunc (oestrum) arcébis pecori (Georg. iii. 154), you shall keep this away from the 
flock. (Cf. illum arcuit Gallia (Phil. v. 37), he excluded him from Gaul.] 
sdlstitium pecori défendite (Ecl. vii. 47), keep the summer heat from the flock. [Cf. 
uti sé 4 contuméliis inimicdrum défenderet (B. C. i. 22), to defend himself 
From the slanders of his enemies.]

accing6, implicd, and similar verbs.

§§ 365, 366] DATIVE OF INDIRECT OBJECT 227 
365. Verbs which in the active voice take the Accusative and 
Dative retain the Dative when used in the passive : — 
nintiaibantur haec eadem Caridni (B. C. ii. 37), these same things were 
announced to Curio. [Active: nintiabant (quidam) haec eadem Ciridni.] 
nec docendi Caesaris propinquis éius spatium datur, nec tribiinis plébis sui 
periculi déprecandi facultas tribuitur (id. i. 5), no time is given Cesar’s 
relatives to inform him, and no opportunity is granted to the tribunes of 
the plebs to avert danger from themselves. 
provinciae privatis décernuntur (id. i. 6), provinces are voted to private 
citizens. 
INDIRECT OBJECT WITH INTRANSITIVES 
366. The Dative of the Indirect Object may be used with any 
intransitive verb whose meaning allows : — 
cédant arma togae (Phil. ii. 20), let arms give place to the gown. 
Caesari respondet, he replies to Cesar. 
Caesari respondétur, a reply is given to Cesar (Cxsar is replied to). [Cf£.§372.] 
-respondi maximis criminibus (Phil. ii. 36), I have answered the heaviest charges. 
ut ita cuique Gveniat (id. ii. 119), that it may so turn out to each. 
Nore 1.—Intransitive verbs have no Direct Object. The Indirect Object, there- 
fore, in these cases stands alone as in the second example (but cf. § 362. a). 
Nore 2. — Céd0, yield, sometimes takes the Ablative of the thing along with the 
Dative of the person: as, — cédere alicui.possessione hortdrum (cf. Mil. 75), to give up to 
one the possession of a garden. 
a. Many phrases consisting of a noun with the copula sum or a 
copulative verb are equivalent to an intransitive verb and take a 
kind of indirect object (cf. § 367. a. N.?):— 
auctor esse alicui, to advise or instigate one (cf. persuaded). 
quis huic rei testis est (Quinct. 37), who testifies (is witness) to this fact ? 
is finis populatidnibus fuit (Liv. ii. 30. 9), this put an end to the raids. 
b. The dative is sometimes used without a copulative verb in a 
sense approaching that of the genitive (cf. §§ 367. d, 377): — 
légatus fratri (Mur. 32), a lieutenant to his brother (i.e. a man assigned to his 
brother). 
ministri sceleribus (Tac. Ann. vi. 36), agents of crime. [Cf. séditiOnis minis- 
tri (id. i. 17), agents of sedition. ] ‘ 
miseriis suis remedium mortem exspectare (Sall. Cat. 40), to look for death 
as a cure for their miseries. [Cf. sdlus medrum miseriarumst remedium 
(Ter. Ad. 294).] 
Nore.— The cases in a and b differ from the constructions of § 367. a. N.? and 
§ 377 in that the dative is more closely connected in idea with some single word to 
which it serves as an indirect object.

367. Many verbs signifying to favor, help, please, trust, and 
their contraries; also to believe, persuade, command, obey, serve, 
resist, envy, threaten, pardon, and spare, take the Dative : — 
cir mihi invidés, why do you envy me? 
mihi parcit atque igndscit, he spares and pardons me. 
igndsce patrid doléri (Liv. iii. 48), excuse a father’s grief. 
subyeni patriae, opitulare conlégae (Fam. x. 10. 2), come to the aid of your 
country, help your colleague. 
mihi nén displicet (Clu. 144), it does not displease me. 
ndn omnibus servid (Att. xiii. 49), I am not a servant to every man. 
non parcam operae (Fam. xiii. 27), I will spare no pains. 
sic mihi persuasi (Cat. M. 78), so I have persuaded myself. 
mihi Fabius débébit igndscere si minus éius famae parcere vidébor quam antea 
cdnsulul (Tull. 8), Fabius will have to pardon me if I seem to spare his 
reputation less than I have heretofore regarded it. 
huic legidni Caesar confidébat maximé (B. G. i. 40. 15), in this legion Cesar 
trusted most. 
In these verbs the Latin retains an original intransitive meaning. 
Thus: invidére, to envy, is literally to look askance at ; servire is to be 
a slave to; suadére is to make a thing pleasant (sweet) to. 
a. Some verbs apparently of the same meanings take the Accusative. 
Such are iuvd, adiuvd, help; laedd, injure; iubed, order; déficid, fail ; 
délectd, please : — 
hic pulvis oculum meum laedit, this dust hurts my eye. -[Cf. multa oculis 
nocent, many things are injurious to the eyes. ] 
Norz 1.— Fido and confidd take also the Ablative (§ 431): as, —muitum natira loci 
cdnfidébant (B. G. iii. 9), they had great confidence in the strength of their position. 
Nove 2.— Some common phrases regularly take the dative precisely like verbs of 
similar meaning. Such, are—praest6 esse, be on hand (cf. adesse); mdrem gerere, 
humor (cf. morigerari); gratum facere, do a favor (cf. gratificari) ; dictd audiéns esse, 
be obedient (cf. oboedire) ; cui fidem habébat (B. G. i. 19), in whom he had confidence 
~ (ef. cdnfidébat). Z 
So also many phrases where no corresponding verb exists. Such are— bene (male, 
pulchré, aegré, etc.) esse, be well (ill, ete.) of; initiriam facere, do injustice to; diem 
dicere, bring to trial (name a day for, etc.); agere gratias, express one’s thanks ; 
habére gratiam, feel thankful; referre gratiam, repay a favor; opus esse, be neces- 
sary; damnum dare, inflict an injury; acceptum (expénsum) ferre (esse), credit

Such are adiilor, aemulor, déspérd, praestdlor, medeor : — 
adilatus est Antonio (Nep. Att. 8), he flattered Antony. 
adulari Nerénem (Tac. Ann. xvi. 19), to flatter Nero. 
pacem non déspéras (Att. viii. 15. 8), you do not despair of peace. 
saliti déspérare vetuit (Clu. 68), he forbade him to despair of safety. 
e. Some verbs are used transitively with the Accusative or intran- 
sitively with the Dative with a difference of meaning : —! 
parti civium cdnsulunt (Off. i. 85), they consult for a part of the citizens. 
cum té cdnsuluissem (Fam. xi. 29), when I had consulted you. 
metuéns pueris (Plaut. Am. 1115), anxious for the children. 
nec metuunt des (Ter. Hec. 772), they fear not even the gods. [So also timed.] 
prospicite patriae (Cat. iv. 3), have regard for the state. : 
prospicere sédem senectiiti (Liv. iv. 49. 14), to provide a habitation for old age. 
[So also provided. ] 
d, A few verbal nouns (as insidiae, ambush; obtemperatid, obedi- 
ence) rarely take the dative like the corresponding verbs : — 
insidiae consuli (Sall. Cat. 32), the plot against the consul (cf. insidior). 
obtemperatid légibus (Legg. i. 42), obedience to the laws (cf. obtemperd). 
sibi ipsi responsid (De Or. 207), an answer to himself (cf. responded). 
Norr. — In these cases the dative depends immediately upon the verbal force of the 
noun and not on any complex idea (cf. § 366. a, b).    
368. The Dative is used — 
1. With the impersonals libet (lubet), i¢ pleases, and licet, it is 
allowed : — 
quod mihi maximé lubet (Fam. i- 8. 8), what most pleases me. 
quasi tibi non licéret (id. vi. 8), as if you were not permitted. 
2. With verbs compounded with satis, bene, and male : — 
mihi ipse numquam satisfacid (Fam. i. 1), I never satisfy myself. 
optim6 vird maledicere (Deiot. 28), to speak ill of a most excellent man. 
pulchrum est benefacere rei piiblicae (Sall. Cat. 3), it is a glorious thing to 
benefit the state. 
Norr.— These are not real compounds, but phrases, and were apparently felt as 
such by the Romans. Thus, — satis officid med, satis illorum voluntati qui 4 mé hoe 
petivérunt factum esse arbitrabor (Verr. v. 130), I shall consider that enough has been 
done for my duty, enough for the wishes of those who asked this of me.

are beseeching you. 
Norts.'— Misceé and iungd sometimes take the dative (see § 413. a. N.), Haered usually 
takes the ablative, with or without in, rarely the dative: as,—haerentem capiti cord- 
nam (Hor. §. i. 10. 49), a wreath clinging to the head. 
a. The dative is often used by the poets in constructions which 
would in prose require a noun with a preposition. So especially 
with verbs of contending (§ 413. 6): — 
contendis Homéré (Prop. i. 7. 8), you vie with Homer. [In prose : cum Homérd.] 
placitdne etiam piignabis amori (Aen. iv. 88), will you struggle even against a 
love that pleases you? 
tibi certat (Ecl. v. 8), vies with you. [técum.] 
differt sermoni (Hor. S. i. 4. 48), differs from prose. [a sermine, § 401.] 
lateri abdidit énsem (Aen. ii. 553), buried the sword in his side. [in latere, 
§ 480. ] 
For the Dative instead of ad with the Accusative, see § 428. h. 
369. Some verbs ordinarily intransitive may have an Accusa- 
tive of the direct object along with the Dative of the indirect 
(cf. § 862. a) :— 
cui cum réx crucem minarétur (Tusce. i. 102), and when the king threatened 
him with the cross. 
Créténsibus obsidés imperavit (Manil. 35), he exacted hostages of the Cretans. 
omnia sibi igndscere (Vell. ii. 30), to pardon one’s self everything. z= 
Ascaniéne pater Romanas invidet arcés (Aen. iv. 234), does the father envy 
Ascanius his Roman citadels? [With invides this construction is poetic 
or late.] 
a. With the passive voice this dative may be retained : — 
qui iam nunc sanguinem meum sibi indulgéri aequum cénset (Liv. xl. 15. 16), 
who even now thinks it right that my blood should be granted to him as a

§ 870] DATIVE WITH COMPOUNDS 231 
Indirect Object with Compounds 
370. Many verbs compounded with ad, ante, con, in, inter, ob, 
post, prae, pro, sub, super, and some with circum, admit the Dative 
of the indirect object :— 
neque enim adsentior eis (Lael. 18), for I do not agree with them. 
quantum nattira hominis pecudibus antecédit (Off. i. 105), so far as man’s 
nature is superior to brutes. 
si sibi ipse cOnsentit (id. i. 5), if he is in accord with himself. 
virtiités semper voluptatibus inhaerent (Fin. i. 68), virtues are always con- 
nected with pleasures. 
omnibus negétiis non interfuit sdlum sed praefuit (id. i. 6), he not only had 
a hand in all matters, but took the lead in them. 
tempestati obsequi artis est (Fam. i. 9. 21), it is a point of skill to yield to 
the weather. 
nec umquam succumbet inimicis (Deiot. 36), and he will never yield to his 
foes. 
cum et Briitus cuilibet ducum praeferendus vidérétur et Vatinius nalli nén 
esset postferendus (Vell. ii. 69), since Brutus seemed worthy of being put 
before any of the generals and Vatinius deserved to be put after all of them. 
a. In these cases the dative depends not on the preposition, but 
on the compound verb in its acquired meaning. Hence, if the acquired 
meaning is not suited to an indirect object, the original construction 
of the simple verb remains. 
Thus in convocat suds, he calls his men together, the idea of calling is not so 
modified as to make an indirect object appropriate. So hominem interficere, to 
make way with a man (kill him). But in praeficere imperatorem bello, to put a 
man as commander-in-chief in charge of a war, the idea resulting from the com- 
position is suited to an indirect object (see also b, §§ 371, 388. 0). 
NoreE 1.—Some of these verbs, being originally transitive, take also a direct object : 
as, —né offeramus nds periculis (Off. i. 83), chat we may not expose ourselves to perils. 
Nore 2.— The construction of § 370 is not different in its nature from that of §§ 362, 
366, and 367; but the compound verbs make a convenient group. 
6. Some compounds of ad, ante, ob, with a few others, have acquired 
a transitive meaning, and take the accusative (cf. § 388. 6): —1 
nds oppignat (Fam. i. 1), he opposes us. 
quis audeat bene comitatum aggredi (Phil. xii. 25), who would dare encounter 
aman well attended ? 
miinus obire (Lael. 7), to attend to a duty. 
1 Such verbs are aggredior, aded, antecédd, anteéd, antegredior, convenid, ined, obed, 
offends, oppiigns, praecéds, subed.

his way. 
mihi obviam vénisti (Fam. ii. 16. 8), you came to meet me.

homine coniiinctd mécum (Tull. 4), a man united to me. 
cum hdc concurrit ipse Eumenés (Nep. Eum. 4. 1), with him Humenes him-

inserite oculés in ciiriam (Font. 43), fix your eyes on the senate-house. 
ignis qui est ob ds offiisus (Tim. 14), the fire which is diffused before the sight. 
obicitur contra istdrum impetiis Macedonia (Font. 44), Macedonia is set to 
withstand their attacks. [Cf£. si quis vobis error obiectus (Caec. 5), if 
any mistake has been caused you. ] 
in segetem flamma incidit (Aen. ii. 304), the fire falls upon the standing corn. 
Norr.— But the usage varies in different authors, in different words, and often in 
the same word and the same sense. The Lexicon must be consulted for each verb. 
372. Intransitive verbs that govern the dative are used émper- 
sonally in.the passive (§ 208. d). The dative is retained (cf. § 365): 
cui parci potuit (Liv, xxi. 14), who could be spared? 
non modo non invidétur illi aetati verum etiam favétur (Off. ii. 45), that age 
(youth) not only is not envied, but is even favored. 
tempori serviendum est(Fam. ix. 7), we must serve the exigency of the occasion. 
Norr.— In poetry the personal construction is sometimes found: as,— cir invideor 
(Hor. A. P. 56), why am I envied? 
Dative of Possession 
373. The Dative is used with esse and similar words to denote 
Possession : — 
est mihi domi pater (Ecl. iii. 33), I have a father at home (there is to me). 
homini cum ded similitiidd est (Legg. i. 25), man has a likeness to God. 
quibus opés niillae sunt (Sall. Cat. 37), [those] who have no wealth. 
Norr.—The Genitive or a Possessive with esse emphasizes the possessor; the 
Dative, the fact of possession: as,—liber est meus, the book is MINE (and no .one’s 
else) ; est mihi liber, J Have a book (among other things). 
a. With ndmen est, and similar expressions, the name is often put 
in the Dative by a kind of apposition with the person; but the 
Nominative is also common : —

  §§ 878-875] DATIVE OF THE AGENT 238 
(1) cui Africdnd fuit cogndmen (Liv. xxv. 2), whose (to whom) surname was 
Africanus. a 
puero ab inopiad Egerid inditum ndmen (id. i. 34), the name Egerius was given 
the boy from his poverty. 
Q) puerd némen est Marcus, the boy’s name is Marcus (to the boy is, etc.). 
cui ndmen Arethiisa (Verr. iv. 118), [a fount] called Arethusa. 
Norr.— In early Latin the dative is usual; Cicero prefers the nominative, Livy the 
dative; Sallust uses the dative only. In later Latin the genitive also occurs (ef. § 343. d): 
as,—Q. Metellé Macedonici nomen inditum est (Vell. i. 11), to Quintus Metellus the 
name of Macedonicus was given. 
b. Désum takes the dative; so occasionally absum (which regu- 
larly has the ablative) : — 
hoc inum Caesari défuit (B.G. iv. 26), this only was lacking to Cesar. 
quid huic abesse poterit (De Or. i. 48), what can be wanting to him? 
Dative of the Agent 
374. The Dative of the Agent is used with the Gerundive to 
denote the person on whom the necessity rests : — 
haec vobis provincia est défendenda (Manil. 14), this province is for you to 
defend (to be defended by you). 
mihi est pignandum, I have to fight (i.e. the need of fighting is to me: cf. 
mihi est liber, I have a book, § 373. n.). 
a, This is the regular way of expressing the agent with the Second 
or Passive Periphrastic Conjugation (§ 196). 
Nore 1, —The Ablative of the Agent with ab (§ 405) is sometimes used with the Sec- 
ond Periphrastic Conjugation when the Dative would be ambiguous or when a stronger 
expression is desired : — 
quibus est 4 vobis consulendum (Manil. 6), for whom you must consult. [Here two 
datives, quibus and vobis, would have been ambiguous.] 
rem ab omnibus vébis providendam (Rabir. 4), that the matter must be attended to 
by all of you. [The dative might mean for all of you.] 
Norr 2.— The Dative of the Agent is either a special use of the Dative of Posses- 
sion or a development of the Dative of Reference (§ 376). 
375. The Dative of the Agent is common with perfect parti- 
ciples (especially when used in an adjective sense), but rare with 
other parts of the verb: — 
mihi déliberatum et constitiitum est (Leg. Agr. i. 25), I have deliberated and 
resolved (it has been deliberated by me). 
mihi rés provisa est (Verr. iv. 91), the matter has been provided for by me. 
sic dissimillimis béstiolis comminiter cibus quaeritur (N. D. ii. 123), so by 
very different creatures food is sought in common.

  234 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [8§ 875-377 
a. The Dative of the Agent is used by the poets and later writers 
with almost any passive verb: — 
neque cernitur alli (Aen. i, 440), nor is seen by any. 
félix est dicta sordri (Ov. Fast. iii. 1. 597), she was called happy by her sister. 
Aelia Paetina Narcissd fovébatur (Tac. Ann. xii. 1), Hlia Petina was 
favored by Narcissus. 
b. The dative of the person who sees or thinks is regularly used 
after videor, seem :— 
vidétur mihi, it seems (or seems good) to me. 
dis aliter visum [est] (Aen. ii. 428), it seemed otherwise to the gods. 
videor mihi perspicere ipsius animum (Fam. iv. 13. 5), I seem (to myself) to see 
the soul of the man himself. 
Norr.—The verb probare, approve (originally a mercantile word), takes a Dative 
of Reference (§ 376), which has become so firmly attached that it is often retained with 
the passive, seemingly as Dative of Agent: — 
haec sententia et illi et ndbis probabatur (Fam. i. 7. 5), this view met both his 
approval and mine (was made acceptable both to him and to me). 
hoc cdnsilium plérisque ndn probabatur (B. C. i. 72), this plan was not approved by 
the majority. [But also, consilium 4 cinctis probabatur (id. i. 74).] 
Dative of Reference 
376. The Dative often depends, not on any particular word, but 
on the general meaning of the sentence (Dative of Reference). 
The dative in this construction is often called the Dative of 
Advantage or Disadvantage, as denoting the person or thing for 
whose benefit or to whose prejudice the action is performed. 
tibi aras (Plaut. Merc. 71), you plough for yourself. 
tuas rés tibi habéto (Plaut. Trin. 266), keep your goods to yourself (formula 
of divorce). 
laudavit mihi fratrem, he praised my brother (out of regard for me; laudavit 
fratrem meum would imply no such motive). 
meritds mactavit hondrés, taurum Neptind, taurum tibi, pulcher Apolld 
(Aen. iii. 118), he offered the sacrifices due, a bull to Neptune, a bull to 
thee, beautiful Apollo. 
Nortr.—In this construction the meaning of the sentence is complete without the 
dative, which is not, as in the preceding constructions, closely connected with any sin- 
gle word. Thus the Dative of Reference is easily distinguishable in most instances 
even when the sentence consists of only two words, as in the first example. 
377. The Dative of Reference is often used to qualify a whole 
idea, instead of the Possessive Genitive modifying a single word : 
1 Dativus commodi aut incommodi.
-P-A-G-E-247
  §§ 377-379] DATIVE OF REFERENCE 235 
iter Poenis vel corporibus suis obstruere (Cat. M. 75), to block the march of 
the Carthaginians even with their own bodies (to block, ete., for the dis- 
advantage of, etc.). 
sé in cOnspectum nautis dedit (Verr. v. 86), he put himself in sight of the 
sailors (he put himself to the sailors into sight). 
versatur mihi ante oculds (id. v. 128), it comes before my eyes (it comes to me 
before the eyes). 
378, The Dative is used of the person from whose point of view 
an opinion is stated or a situation or a direction is defined. 
This is often called the Dative of the Person Judging, but is 
merely a weakened variety of the Dative of Reference. It is used — 
1. Of the mental point of view (in my opinion, according to me, 
ate.) :— 
Platd mihi Ginus instar est centum milium (Brut. 191), in my opinion (to me) 
Plato alone is worth a hundred thousand. 
erit ille mihi semper deus (Ecl. i. 7), he will always be a god to me (in my 
regard). - 
quae est ista servitiis tam clar6 homini (Par. 41), what is that slavery according 
to the view of this distinguished man? 
2. Of the local point of view (as you go in etc.). In this use the 
person is commonly denoted indefinitely by a participle in the dative 
plural : — 
oppidum primum Thessaliae venientibus ab Epiré (B. C. iii. 80), the first town 
of Thessaly as you come from Epirus (to those coming, etc.). 
laeva parte sinum intranti (Liv. xxvi. 26), on the left as you sail up the gulf 
(to one entering). 
est urbe égressis tumulus (Aen. ii. 718), there is, as you come out of the city, 
a mound (to those having come out). 
Norr.—The Dative of the Person Judging is (by a Greek idiom) rarely modified by 
ndléns, voléns (participles of nd16, vold), or by some similar word: — 
ut quibusque bellum invitis aut cupientibus erat (Tac. Ann. i. 59), as each might 
receive the war reluctantly or gladly. 
ut militibus labds volentibus esset (Iug. 100), that the soldiers might assume the 
task willingly. 
379. The Dative of Reference is used idiomatically without 
any verb in colloquial questions and exclamations : — 
qué mihi fortiinam (Hor. Ep. i. 5. 12), of what use to me is fortune? 
unde mihi lapidem (Hor. §. ii. 7. 116), where can I get a stone? 
qu tibi, Tilli (id. i. 6. 24), what use for you, Tillius?

vae victis (Liv. v. 48), woe to the conquered. 
em tibi, there, take that (there for you)! [Cf. § 380.] 
Notz.—To express FoR— meaning instead of, in defence of, in behalf of —the

ego ibd pro té (Plaut. Most. 1131), I will go instead of you. 
Ethical Dative 
380. The Dative of the Personal Pronouns is used to show a 
certain interest felt by the person indicated. 
they This construction is called the Ethical Dative.* It is really a 
faded variety of the Dative of Reference. 
quid mihi Celsus agit (Hor. Ep. i. 3. 15), pray what is Celsus doing ? 
suo sibi servit patri (Plaut. Capt. 5), he serves his own father. 
at tibi repente venit mihi Caninius (Fam. ix. 2), but, look you, of a sudden 
comes to me Caninius. 
hem tibi talentum argenti (Pl. Truc. 60), hark ye, a talent of silver. 
quid tibi vis, what would you have (what do you wish for yourself) ? 
Dative of Separation 
381. Many verbs of taking away and the like take the Dative 
(especially of a person) instead of the Ablative of Separation 
(§ 401). 
Such are compounds of ab, dé, ex, and a few of ad: — 
aureum ei détraxit amiculum (N. D. iii. 85), he took from him his cloak of 
gold. ion 
hunc mihi terrdrem éripe (Cat. i. 18), take from me this terror. 
vitam aduléscentibus vis aufert (Cat. M. 71), violence deprives young men of 
life. 
nihil enim tibi détraxit sendtus (Fam. i. 58), for the senate has taken nothing 
From you. 
nec mihi hunc errdrem extorquéri vold (Cat. M. 85), nor do I wish this error 
wrested from me. 
Nors. — The Dative of Separation is a variety of the Dative of Reference. It repre- 
sents the action as done to the person or thing, and is thus more vivid than the Ablative.

  §§ 381, 382] DATIVE OF THE PURPOSE OR END 237 
a. The distinct idea of motion requires the ablative with a prep- 
osition —thus generally with names of things (§ 426. 1): — 
illum ex periculd éripuit (B. G. iv. 12), he dragged him out of danger. 
Nore. — Sometimes the dative of the person and the ablative of the thing with a 
preposition are both used with the same verb: as, — mihi praeda dé manibus éripitur 
(Verr. ii. 1. 142), the booty is wrested from my hands. 
Dative of the Purpose or End 
382. The Dative is used to denote the Purpose or End, often 
with another Dative of the person or thing affected. 
This use of the dative, once apparently general, remains in 
only a few constructions, as follows:   
1. The dative of an abstract noun is used to show that for which 
a thing serves or which tt accomplishes, often with another dative of 
the person or thing affected : — 
rei piiblicae cladi sunt (Iug. 85. 43), they are ruin to the state (they are for a 
disaster to the state). 
magn6 isui nostris fuit (B. G. iv. 25), it was of great service to our men (to 
our men for great use). 
tertiam aciem nostris subsidié misit (id. i. 52), he sent the third line as a relief 
to our men. 
suis saliti fuit (id. vii. 50), he was the salvation of his men. 
événit facile quod dis cordi esset (Liv. i. 39), that came to pass easily which 
was desired by the gods (was for a pleasure [lit. heart] to the gods). 
Nore 1.— This construction is often called the Dative of Service, or the Double 
Dative construction. The verb is usually sum, The noun e.cpressing the end for 
which is regularly abstract and singular in number and is never modified by an adjec- 
tive, except one of degree (magnus, minor, etc.), or by a genitive. 
Norn 2.— The word friigi used as an adjective is a dative of this kind: — 
cdgis mé dicere inimicum Frigi (Font. 39), you compel me to call my enemy Honest. 
hominés satis fortés et plané friigi (Verr. iii. 67), men brave enough and thoroughly 
honest. Cf. erd frigi bonae (Plaut. Pseud. 468), I will be good for some- 
thing. [See § 122. b.] 
2. The Dative of Purpose of concrete nouns is used in prose in a 
few military expressions, and with freedom in poetry : — 
locum castris déligit (B. G. vii. 16), he selects a site for a camp. 
receptui canere, to sound a retreat (for a retreat). _ 
receptui signum (Phil. xiii. 15), the signal for retreat. 
optavit locum régnd (Aen. iii. 109), he chose a place for a kingdom. 
locum insidiis circumspectare (Liv. xxi. 58), to look about for a place for an 
ambush. [Cf. locum séditidnis quaerere (id. iii. 46).]

Dative with Adjectives 
383. The Dative is used after Adjectives or Adverbs, to denote 
that to which the given quality is directed, for which i exists, or 
towards which it tends. 
Norsr.— The dative with certain adjectives is in origin a Dative of Purpose or End. 
384. The Dative is used with adjectives (and a few Adverbs) of 
fitness, nearness, likeness, service, inclination, and their opposites : + 
nihil est tam natiirae aptum (Lael. 17), nothing is so fitted to nature. 
nihil difficile amanti put6 (Or. 33), I think nothing hard to a lover. 
castris iddneum locum délégit (B. G. i. 49), he selected a place suitable for a 
camp. 
tribini nobis sunt amici (Q. Fr. i. 2. 16), the tribunes are friendly to us. 
esse propitius potest némini (N. D. i. 124), he can be gracious to nobody. 
magnis autem viris prosperae semper omnés rés (id. ii. 167), but to great men

Nore 1.— So, also, in poetic and colloquial use, with idem: as, —invitum qui servat 
idem facit occidenti (Hor. A. P. 467), he who saves a man against his will does the same 
as one who kills him. 
Nore 2.— Adjectives of likeness are often followed by atque (ac), as. So also 
the adverbs aequé, pariter, similiter, ete. The pronoun idem has regularly atque or a 
relative: — 
si parem sapientiam habet ac formam (Plaut. Mil. 1251), if he has sense equal to 
his beauty (like as his beauty). 
té suspicor eisdem rébus quibus mé ipsum commoyéri (Cat. M. 1), I suspect you are 
disturbed by the same things by which I am. 
385. Other constructions are sometimes found where the dative 
might be expected : — 
a. Adjectives of fitness or use take oftener the Accusative with ad 
to denote the purpose or end ; but regularly the Dative of persons : — 
aptus ad rem militarem, fit for a soldier’s duty. 
locus ad insidids aptior (Mil. 53), a place jitter for lying in wait. 
nobis iitile est ad hanc rem (cf. Ter. And. 287), it is of use to us for this thing.

dé benevolentia quam quisque habeat erga nds (Off. i. 47), in regard to each 
man’s good will which he has towards us. 
gratidrem mé esse in té (Fam. xi. 10), that I am more grateful to you. 
e. Some adjectives of likeness, nearness, belonging, and a few 
others, ordinarily requiring the Dative, often take the Possessive 
Genitive :—? : 
quod ut illi proprium ac perpetuum sit . . . optare débétis (Manil. 48), which 
you ought to pray may be secure (his own) and lasting to him. [Dative.]

bound to both. [Dative.] 
procirator aequé utriusque necessarius (Quinct. 86), an agent alike closely 
connected with both. [Genitive.] 
1. The genitive is especially used with these adjectives when they are 
used wholly or approximately as nouns : — 
amicus Cicerdni, friendly to Cicero. But, Cicerdnis amicus, a friend of Cicero ; 
and even, Cicerénis amicissimus, a very great friend of Cicero. 
créticus et éius aequalis paean (Or. 215), the cretic and its equivalent the pean. 
hi erant affinés istius (Verr. ii. 36), these were this man’s fellows. 
2. After similis, like, the genitive is more common in early writers. 
Cicero regularly uses the genitive of persons, and either the genitive or the 
dative of things. With personal pronouns the genitive is regular (mel, tui, 
etc.), and also in véri similis, probable : — 
domini similis es (Ter. Eun. 496), you ’re like your master (your master’s like’. 
ut essémus similés dedrum (N. D. i. 91), that we might be like the gods. 
est similis maidrum suom (Ter. Ad. 411), he’s like his ancestors. 
patris similis esse (Off. i. 121), to be like his father. 
simia quam similis turpissima béstia nobis (N. D. i. 97, quoted from Enn.), 
how like us is that wretched beast the ape! 
si enim hdc illi simile sit, est illud huic (id. i. 90), for if this is like that, that

  240 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [S$ 386, 387 
ACCUSATIVE CASE 
386. The Accusative originally served to connect the noun more or less loosely 
with the verb-idea, whether expressed by a verb proper or by a verbal noun or adjec- 
tive. Its earliest use was perhaps to repeat the verb-idea as in the Cognate Accusative 
(runarace, fight a battle, see § 390). From this it would be a short step to the Factitive 
Accusative (denoting the result of an act, as in make a table, drill a hole, cf. § 273. N.1). 
From this last could easily come the common accusative (of Affecting, break a table, 
plug ahole, see § 387. a). Traces of all these uses appear in the language, and the loose 
connection of noun with verb-idea is seen in the use of stems in composition (cf. §265.3).1 
It is impossible, however, to derive the various constructions of the accusative with 
certainty from any single function of that case. 
The uses of the accusative may be classified as follows: 
1. Directly affected by the Action (§ 387. a). 
I. Primary Object: A Thing produced (§ 387. a). 
| 2. Effect of the Action { Gograte Accusative (§ 350). . Predicate Accusative (Of Naming etc.) (§ 393). 
Of Asking or Teaching (§ 396). 
Of Concealing (§ 396. ¢). 
. Adverbial (§ 397. a). 
Of Specification (Greek Accusative) (§ 397. 6). 
. Of Extent and Duration (§§ 423, 425). 
Of Exclamation (§ 397. d). 
. Subject of Infinitive (§ 397. ¢). Il. Two Accusatives: { 
Il. Idiomatic Uses: CUR

Direct Object 
387. The Direct Object of a transitive verb is put in the Ac- 
cusative (§ 274). 
a, The Accusative of the Direct Object denotes (1) that which is 
directly affected, or (2) that which is caused or produced by the action 
of the verb: — 
(1) Britus Caesarem interfécit, Brutus killed Cesar. 
(2) aedem facere, to make a temple. [Cf. proelium piignare, to fight a battle, 
§ 390.] 
Norsr.— There is no definite line by which transitive verbs can be distinguished 
from intransitive. Verbs which usually take a direct object (expressed or implied) 
are called transitive, but many of these are often used intransitively or absolutely. 
Thus timed, I fear, is transitive in the sentence inimicum timed, J fear my enemy, but 
intransitive (absolute) in n6li timére, don’t be afraid. Again, many verbs are transi- 
tive in one sense and intransitive in another: as, — Helvétids superavérunt Romani, the 
Romans overcame the Helvetians; but nihil superabat, nothing remained (was left over). 
So also many verbs commonly intransitive may be used transitively with a slight 
change of meaning: as, —ridés, you are laughing; but mé ridés, you’re laughing at-me. 
1 Compare armiger, armor-bearer, with arma gerere, to bear arms; fidicen, lyre-player, 
with fidibus canere, to (play on) sing to the lyre. Compare also istanc tactid (Plaut.), the 
[act of] touching her, with istanc tangere, to touch her (§ 388. d. N.2).
-P-A-G-E-253
  §§ 887, 388] ACCUSATIVE OF DIRECT OBJECT. 241 
b. The object of a transitive verb in the active voice becomes its 
subject in the passive, and is put in the nominative (§ 275): — 
Briitus Caesarem interfécit, Brutus killed Cesar. 
Caesar 4 Briitd interfectus est, Cesar was killed by Brutus. 
domum aedificat, he builds a house. 
domus aedificdtur, the house is building (being built). 
388. Certain special verbs require notice. 
a. Many verbs apparently intransitive, expressing feeling, take 
an accusative, and may be used in the passive : — 
meum casum lictumque doluérunt (Sest. 145), they grieved at my calamity 
and sorrow. 
si ndn Acrisium risissent Iuppiter et Venus (Hor. Od. iii. 16. 5), if Jupiter 
and Venus had not laughed at Acrisius. 
ridétur ab omni conventii (Hor. S. i. 7. 22), he is laughed at by the whole 
assembly. 
For the Cognate Accusative with verbs of taste, smell, and the like, see § 390. a. 
Norxr.— Some verbs commonly intransitive may be used transitively (especially in 
poetry) from a similarity of meaning with other verbs that take the accusative: — 
geméns igndminiam (Georg. iii. 226), groaning at the disgrace. [CE£. doled.] 
festinare fugam (Aen. iv. 575), to hasten their flight. [Cf. accelero.] 
comptds Arsit crinis (Hor. Od. iv. 9. 13), she burned with love for his well-combed 
locks. [Ci. adamé,] 
b. Verbs of motion, compounds of circum, trans, and praeter, and 
a few others, frequently become transitive, and take the accusative 
(ef. § 370. b): — 
mortem obire, to die (to meet death). 
cOnsulatum ineunt (Liv. ii. 28), they enter upon the consulship. 
néminem conyéni (Fam. ix. 14), I met no one. 
si insulam adisset (B. G. iv. 20), if he should go to the island. 
transire fliimen (id. ii. 23), to cross the river (cf. § 395). 
civés qui circumstant sendtum (Cat. i. 21), the citizens who stand about the 
senate. 
Norr.— Among such verbs are some compounds of ad, in, per, and sub. 
c. The accusative is used after the impersonals decet, dédecet, délec- 
tat, iuvat, oportet, fallit, fugit, praeterit : — 
ita ut vos decet (Plaut. Most. 729), so as befits you. 
mé pedibus délectat claudere verba (Hor. S. ii. 1. 28), my delight is (it 
pleases me) to arrange words in measure. 
nisi mé fallit, unless I am mistaken (unless it deceives me). 
ifivit mé tibi tuds litteras prdfuisse (Fam. y. 21. 8), it pleased me that your 
literary studies had profited you. 
té non praeterit (Fam. i. 8. 2), it does not escape your notice.

Nore 1.—So after latet in poetry and post-classical prose: as, —latet plérdsque 
' (lin. N. H. ii. 82), it is unknown to most persons. 
Nore 2.— These verbs are merely ordinary transitives with an idiomatic significa- 
tion. Hence most of them are also used personally. 
Nore 3.—Decet and latet sometimes take the dative: — 
ita nobis decet (Ter. Ad. 928), thus it befits us. 
hostique Roma latet (Sil. It. xii. 614), and Rome lies hidden from the foe. 
d. A few verbs in isolated expressions take the accusative from 
a forcing of their meaning. Such expressions are :— 
ferire foedus, to strike a treaty (i.e. to sanction by striking down a victim). 
vincere iiidicium (spdnsiénem, rem, hic), to prevail on a trial, etc. [As if the 
. case were a difficulty to overcome ; cf. vincere iter, Aen. vi. 688.] 
aequor navigire (Aen. i. 67), to sail the sea. [As if it were transire, § 388. b.] 
maria aspera iiird (id. vi. 351), I swear by the rough seas (cf. id. vi. 324). 
[The accusative with verbs of swearing is chiefly poetic.] 
noctis dormire, to sleep [whole] nights (to spend in sleep). 
Norte 1.— These accusatives are of various kinds. The last example approaches 
the cognate-.construction (cf. the second example under § 390). 
Nore 2.—In early and popular usage some nouns and adjectives derived from tran- 
sitive verbs retain verbal force sufficient to govern the accusative :— 
quid tibi istanc tactid est (Plaut. Poen. 1308), what business have you to touch her? 
[Cf. tango.] 
mirabundi béstiam (Ap. Met. iv. 16), full of wonder at the creature. [Cf. miror.] 
yitabundus castra (Liv. xxv. 13), trying to avoid the camp. [Cf. vito.] 
389. Many verbs ordinarily transitive may be used absolutely, 
having their natural object in the ablative with dé (§ 273. N. 2): — 
priusquam Pompénius dé éius adventii cdgndsceret (B. C. iii. 101), before 
Pomponius could learn of his coming. [Cf. éius adventii cdgnitd, his 
arrival being discovered. |

after the impersonal Gerundive with esse, see § 500. 3. 
Cognate Accusative 
390. An intransitive verb often takes the Accusative of a noun 
of kindred meaning, usually modified by an adjective or in some 
other manner. 
This construction is called the Cognate Accusative or Accusative 
of Kindred Signification : — 
titidrem vitam vivere (Verr. ii. 118), to live a safer life. 
tertiam iam aetatem hominum vivébat (Cat. M. 31), he was now living the 
third generation of men. 
servitiitem servire, to be in slavery. 
coire societatem, to [go together and] form an alliance.
-P-A-G-E-255
§ 390] COGNATE ACCUSATIVE 248 
a. Verbs of taste, smell, and the like take a cognate accusative 
of the quality : — 
vinum redoléns (Phil. ii. 63), smelling [of] wine. 
herbam mella sapiunt (Plin. H. N. xi. 18), the honey tastes [of] grass. 
olére malitiam (Rosc. Com. 20), to have the odor of malice. 
Cordubae natis poétis, pingue quiddam sonantibus atque peregrinum (Arch. 
26), to poets born at Cordova, whose speech had a somewhat thick and 
foreign accent. 
b. The cognate accusative is often loosely used by the poets : = 
huic erréri similem [errérem] insanire (Hor. S. ii. 3. 62), to suffer a delusion 
like this. 
saltdre Cyclopa (id. i. 5. 68), to dance the Cyclops (represent in dancing). 
Bacchanalia vivere (Iuv. ii. 8), to live in revellings. 
Amaryllida resonare (Ecl. i. 5), to reécho [the name of] Amaryllis. 
intonuit laevum (Aen. ii. 693), it thundered on the left. 
dulce ridentem, dulce loquentem (Hor. Od. i. 22. 23), sweetly smiling, sweetly 
prattling. : 
acerba tuéns (Aen. ix. 794), looking fiercely. [Cf. Eng. ‘to look daggers.’””] 
torvum climat (id. vii. 399), he cries harshly. 
ec. A neuter pronoun or an adjective of indefinite meaning is very 
common as cognate accusative (cf. §§ 214. d, 897. a): — 
Empedoclés multa alia peccat (N. D. i. 29), Hmpedocles commits many other 
errors. 
ego illud adsentior Theophrastd (De Or. iii. 184), in this I agree with Theo- 
phrastus. 
multum té ista fefellit opinid (Verr. ii. 1. 88), you were much deceived in this 
expectation (this expectation deceived you much). 
plis valed, I have more strength. 
plirimum potest, he is strongest. 
quid mé ista laedunt (Leg. Agr. ii. 82), what harm do those things do me ? 
hoc té moned, I give you this warning (cf. d. n. 1). 
id laetor, I rejoice at this (cf. d. x. 1). 
quid moror, why do I delay ? 
quae hominés arant, navigant, aedificant (Sall. Cat. ii. 7), what men do in 
ploughing, sailing, and building. 
d. So in many common phrases : — 
si quid ille sé velit (B. G. i. 84), if he should want anything of him (if he 
should want him in anything). 
numquid, Geta, aliud mé vis (Ter. Ph. 151), can I do anything more for you, 
Geta (there is nothing you want of me, is there)? [A common form 
of leave-taking. ] 
quid est quod, etc., why is it that, etc.? [Cf. hdc erat quod (Aen. ii. 664), 
was it for this that, ete.?]
-P-A-G-E-256
      244 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [S§ 390-398 
Nore 1.—In these cases substantives with a definite meaning would be in some 
other construction :— 
in hdc eddem peccat, he errs in this same point. 
bonis rébus laetari, to rejoice at prosperity. [Also: in, dé, or ex.] 
dé testamentd monére, to remind one of the will. [Later: genitive, § 351.] 
offici admonére, to remind one of his duty. [Also: dé offici6.] 
Norr 2.— In some of these cases the connection of the accusative with the verb has 
so faded out that the words have become real adverbs: as, —multum, plis, plirimum ; 
plérumque, for the most part, generally; céterum, cétera, for the rest, otherwise, but; 
primum, first ; nibil, by no means, not at all; aliquid, somewhat ; quid, why ; facile, easily. 
So in the comparative of adverbs (§ 218). But the line cannot be sharply drawn, and 
some of the examples under b may be classed as adverbial. 
* Two AccusATIVES 
391. Some transitive verbs take a second accusative in addi- 
tion to their Direct Object. 
This second accusative is either (1) a Predicate Accusative or 
(2) a Secondary Object. i 
Predicate Accusative 
392. An accusative in the Predicate referring to the same per- 
son or thing as the Direct Object, but not in apposition with it, 
is called a Predicate Accusative. 
393. Verbs of naming, choosing, ined. making, esteeming, 
showing, and the like, may take a Predicate Accusative along 
with the direct object: — 
6 Spartace, quem enim té potius appellem (Phil. xiii, 22), O Spartacus, for 
what else shall I call you (than Spartacus)? 
Cicerdnem cénsulem creare, to elect Cicero consul. _ 
mé augurem nominavérunt (Phil. ii. 4), they nominated me for augur. 
cum gratias ageret quod sé cdnsulem fécisset (De Or. ii. 268), when he thanked 
him because he had made him consul (supported his candidacy). 
hominem prae sé néminem putavit (Rose. Am. 135), he thought nobody a man 
in comparison with himself. 
ducem sé praebuit (Vat. 33), he offered himself as a leader. 
Notx.—The predicate accusative may be an adjective: as,—hominés mitis red- 
didit et mansuétis (Inv. i. 2), has made men mild and gentle. 
a. Inchanging from the active voice to the passive, the Predicate 
Accusative becomes Predicate Nominative (§ 284):— 
réx ab suis appellatur (B. G. viii. 4), he is called king by his subjects. [Active: 
sui eum régem appellant. ]
-P-A-G-E-257
  §§ 894, 8395] ACCUSATIVE OF THE SECONDARY OBJECT 245 
Secondary Object 
394. The Accusative of the Secondary Object is used (along 
with the direct object) to denote something more remotely affected 
by the action of the verb. 
395. Transitive verbs compounded with prepositions sometimes 
take (in addition to the direct object) a Secondary Object, origi- 
nally governed by the preposition : — 
Caesar Germanés flimen traicit (B. C. i. 83), Caesar throws the Germans 
across the river. 
idem itis iftrandum adigit Afranium (id. i. 76), he exacts the same oath from 
Afranius. 
qués Pompéius omnia sua praesidia circumdixit (id. iii. 61), whom Pompey 
conducted through all his garrison. 
Nore 1.— This construction is common only with tradicd, traicis, and transports. 
The preposition is sometimes repeated with compounds of trans, and usually with 
compounds of the other prepositions. The ablative is also used:— 
ddnec rés suis trans Halyn fliimen traicerent (Liv. xxxviii. 25), till they should get 
their possessions across the river Halys. 
(exercitus) Pad6 traiectus Cremdnam (id. xxi. 56), the army was conveyed across 
the Po to Cremona (by way of the Po, § 429. a). 
Norr 2.— The secondary object may be retained with a passive verb: as,— Belgae 
Rhénum traducti sunt (B. G. ii. 4), the Belgians were led over the Rhine. 
Nore 3.— The double construction indicated in § 395 is possible only when the force 
of the preposition and the force of the verb are each distinctly felt in the compound, 
the verb governing the direct, and the preposition the secondary object. 
But often the two parts of the compound become closely united to form a transitive 
verb of simple meaning. In this case the compound verb is transitive solely by virtue 
of its prepositional part and can have but one accusative, —the same which was for- 
merly the secondary object, but which now becomes the direct. So traicid comes to 
mean either (1) to pierce (anybody) [by hurling] or (2) ¢o cross (a river ete.):— 
gladid hominem traiécit, he pierced the man with a sword. [Here iacid has lost 
all transitive force, and serves simply to give the force of a verb to the mean- 
ing of trans, and to tell the manner of the act.] 
Rhodanum traiécit, he crossed the Rhone. [Here iacid has become simply averb 
of motion, and traicié is hardly distinguishable from transed.] 
In these examples hominem and Rhodanum, which would be secondary objects if traiécit 
were used in its primary signification, have become the direct objects. Hence in the 
passive construction they become the subjects and are put in the nominative: — 
hom6 traiectus est gladid, the man was pierced with a sword. 
Rhodanus traiectus est, the Rhone was crossed. 
The poetical traiectus lora (Aen. ii. 273), pierced with thongs, comes from a mixture of 
two constructions: (1) eum tri it lora, he rove thongs through him,! and (2) eum 
traiécit loris, he pierced him with thongs. In putting the sentence into a passive form, 
the direct object of the former (lora) is irregularly kept, and the direct object of the 
latter (Cum) is made the subject.     
1 Perhaps not found in the active, but cf. traiectd fine (Aen. v. 488).

  246 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [g§ 396 
396. Some verbs of asking and teaching may take two accusa- 
tives, one of the Person (direct object), and the other of the Thing 
(secondary object): — 
mé sententiam rogivit, he asked me my opinion. 
Stium divds rogat (Hor. Od. ii. 16. 1), he prays the gods for rest. 
haec praetdrem postulabas (Tull. 39), you demanded this of the pretor. 
aedilis populum rogire (Liv. vi. 42), to ask the people [to elect] ediles. 
docére puerds elementa, to teach children their A B C's, 
Nors.— This construction is found in classical authors with 6r6, poscd, reposcd, rogd, 
interrogé, flagitd, doced. 
a. Some verbs of asking take the ablative of the person with a 
preposition instead of the accusative. So, always, petd (ab), quaerd 
(ex, ab, dé); usually poscd (ab), flagito (ab), postuld (ab), and occa- 
sionally others : — 
pacem ab RémAnis petiérunt (B. G. ii. 18), they sought peace from the Romans. 
quod quaesivit ex mé P. Apuléius (Phil. vi. 1), what Publius Apuleius asked 
of me. 
  b. With the passive of some verbs of asking or teaching, the per- 
son or the thing may be used as subject (cf. ¢. N.?):— 
Caesar sententiam rogatus est, Cesar was asked his opinion. 
id ab ed flagitabatur (B. C. i. 71), this was urgently demanded of him. 
Nors.— The accusative of the thing may be retained with the passive of rog6, and 
of verbs of teaching, and occasionally with a few other verbs: — 
fuerant hoc rogati (Cael. 64), they had been asked this. 
poscor meum Laelapa (Oy. M. vii. 771), I am asked for my Lelaps. 
Cicer6 ciincta édoctus (Sall. Cat. 45), Cicero, being informed of everything. 
But with most verbs of asking in prose the accusative of the thing becomes the 
subject nominative, and the accusative of the person is put in the ablative with a 
preposition: as,—né postulantur quidem virés 4 senectiite (Cat. M. 34), strength is 
not even expected of an old man (asked from old age). 
c. The verb cél6, conceal, may take two accusatives, and the usually 
intransitive lated, lie hid, an accusative of the person: — 
non té célavi sermonem T. Ampi (Fam. ii. 16. 3), I did not conceal from you 
the talk of Titus Ampius. 
nec latuére doli fratrem Itindnis (Aen. i. 130), nor did the wiles of Juno 
escape the notice of her brother. 
Nore 1.—The accusative of the person with lated is late or poetical (§ 388. c. N.1). 
Nore 2.— All the double constructions indicated in § 396 arise from the waver- 
ing meaning of the verbs. Thus doced means both to show a thing, and to instruct 
; @ person; cél0, to keep a person in the dark, and to hide a thing; rog, to question 
a person, and to ask a question or a thing. Thus either accusative may be regarded 
as the direct object, and so become the subject of the passive (cf. b above), but for 
convenience the accusative of the thing is usually called secondary.

§ 897] IDIOMATIC USES OF THE ACCUSATIVE 247 
Idiomatic Uses 
397. The Accusative has the following special uses : — ) 
a. The accusative is found in a few adverbial phrases (Adverbial 
Accusative) : — 
id temporis, at that time; id (istuc) aetatis, at that age. 
id (quod) genus, of that (what) sort (perhaps originally nominative). 
meam vicem, on my part. 
bonam partem, in a great measure ; maximam partem, for the most part. 
virile (muliebre) secus, of the male (female) sex (probably originally in 
apposition). 
quod si, but if (as to which, if); quod nisi, if not. 
b. The so-called synecdochical or Greek Accusative, found in poetry 
and later Latin, is used to denote the part affected: — 
caput nectentur (Aen. v. 309), their heads shall be bound (they shall be bound 
about the head). 
ardentis oculds suffecti sanguine et igni (id. ii. 210), their glaring eyes blood- 
shot and blazing with fire (suffused as to their eyes with blood and fire). 
niida gen (id. i. 820), with her knee bare (bare as to the knee). 
femur tragula ictus (Liv. xxi. 7. 10), wounded in the thigh by a dart. 
Nors.— This construction is also called the Accusative of Specification. 
ce. In many apparently similar expressions the accusative may be 
regarded as the direct object of a verb in the middle voice (§ 156. a): 
initile ferrum cingitur (Aen. ii. 510), he girds on the useless steel. 
nod6 sinis collécta fiuentis (id. i. 320), having her flowing folds gathered in 
a knot. 
umerds insternor pelle lednis (id. ii. 722), I cover my shoulders with a lion’s 
skin. 
protinus induitur faciem cultumque Didnae (Ov. M. ii. 425), forthwith she 
assumes the shape and garb of Diana. 
d. The Accusative is used in Exclamations : — 
6 fortinatam rem piblicam, O fortunate republic! [Cf. 6 fortimata mors 
(Phil. xiv. 31), oh, happy death! (§ 339. a).] 
6 mé infélicem (Mil. 102), oh, unhappy I! 
mé miserum, ah, wretched me! 
én quattuor aras (Ecl. v. 65), lo, four altars! 
ellum (= em illum), there he is! [Cf. § 146. a. n.2.] 
eccds (= ecce eds), there they are, look at them! 
pro deum fidem, good heavens (O protection of the gods) ! 
hicine saeclum (Ter. Ad. 304), O this generation! 
huncine hominem (Verr. y. 62), this man, good heavens !

    248 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [s§ 897, 398 
Norr 1.—Such expressions usually depend upon some long-forgotten verb. The 
substantive is commonly accompanied by an adjective. The use of -ne in some cases 
suggests an original question, as in quid? what? why? tell me. 
Nore 2.— The omission of the verb has given rise to some other idiomatic accusa- 
tives. Such are: — 
saliitem (sc. dicit) (in addressing a letter), greeting. 
mé dius fidius (sc. adiuvet), so help me heaven (the god of faith). 
unde mihi lapidem (Hor. §. ii. 7. 116), where can I get a stone? 
quo mihi fortinam (Hor. Ep. i. 5. 12), of what use to me is fortune? [No verb 
thought of.] 
e. The subject of an infinitive is in the accusative : — 
intellegd té sapere (Fam. vii. 82. 3), I perceive that you are wise. 
eas rés iactari ndlébat (B. G. i. 18), he was unwilling that these matters should 
be discussed. 
Nors. — This construction is especially common with verbs of knowing, thinking, 
telling, and perceiving (§ 580).   
  f. The accusative in later writers is sometimes used in apposition 
with a clause : — 
déserunt tribiinal . . . maniis intentantés, causam discordiae et initium armé- 
rum (Tac. Ann. i. 27), they abandon the tribunal shaking their fists, — 
a cause of dissension and the beginning of war. 
Nors. — This construction is an extension (under Greek influence) of a usage more 
nearly within the ordinary rules, such as, —Eumenem prodidére Antioch6, pacis mercé- 
dem (Sall. Ep. Mith. 8), they betrayed Eumenes to Antiochus, the price of peace. [Here 
Eumenes may be regarded as the price, although the real price is the betrayal.]

tion of Time and Extent of Space, see §§ 425, 425 ; for the Accusative with Prepositions,

ABLATIVE CASE 
898. Under the name Ablative are included the meanings and, in part, the forms 
of three cases,—the Ablative proper, expressing the relation From; the Locative, 
iN; and the Instrumental, wirH or By. These three cases were originally not wholly 
distinct in meaning, and their confusion was rendered more certain (1) by the develop- 
ment of meanings that approached each other and (2) by phonetic decay, by means of 
which these cases have become largely identical in form. Compare, for the first, the 
phrases 4 parte dextera, on the right; quam ob causam, rrom which cause; ad famam, 
Art (in consequence of) the report; and, for the second, the like forms of the dative 
and ablative plural, the old dative in -€ of the fifth declension (§ 96), and the loss of the 
original -d of the ablative (§ 49. e; ef. §§ 43. n.1, 92. f, 214. a. N.). 
The relation of From includes separation, source, cause, agent, and comparison; 
that of WITH or BY, accompaniment, instrument, means, manner, quality, and price; 
that of IN or At, place, time, circumstance. This classification according to the 
original cases (to which, however, too great a degree of certainty should not be 
attached)1 is set forth in the following table: — 
1 Thus the Ablative of Cause may be, at least in part, of Instrumental origin, and 
* the Ablative Absolute appears to combine the Instrumental and the Locative.

the ablative.

want, take the Ablative (sometimes with ab or ex) : —

omni Gallia Rdm4nis interdicit (B. G. i. 46), he (Ariovistus) bars the Romans

plébs orba tribiinis (Leg. iii. 9), the people deprived of tribunes. 
Norr.— A preposition sometimes occurs : — 
4 culpa vacuus (Sall. Cat. 14), free from blame. 
Tiberi 4 déliciis (Leg. Agr. i. 27), free from luxuries. 
Messina ab his rébus vacua atque niida est (Verr. iv. 3), Messana is empty and 
bare of these things. 
For the Genitive with adjectives of want, see § 349. a.   
Ablative of Source and Material 
403. The Ablative (usually with a preposition) is used to denote 
the Source from which anything is derived, or the Material of 
which it consists : — 
1. Source : — 
Rhénus oritur ex Lepontiis (B. G. iv. 10), the Rhine rises in (from) the 
country of the Lepontii. © 
ab his serm6 oritur (Lael: 5), the conversation is begun by (arises from) them. 
cflius ratidnis vim atque itilitatem ex illd caelesti Epiciri voliimine accépi- 
mus (N. D. i. 43), of this reasoning we have learned the power and 
advantage from that divine book of Epicurus. 
suavitatem oddrum qui afflarentur é fldribus (Cat. M. 59), the sweetness of 
the odors which breathed from the flowers,

  § 403] ABLATIVE OF SOURCE AND MATERIAL 251 7 
2. Material :— 
erat totus ex fraude et mendacid factus (Clu. 72), he was entirely made up of 
fraud and falsehood. 
valvis magnificentidrés, ex aurd atque ebore perfectidrés (Verr. iv. 124), 
more splendid doors, more finely wrought of gold and ivory. 
factum dé cautibus antrum (Ov. M. i. 575), a cave formed of rocks. 
templum dé marmore pénam (Georg. iii. 13), I’Ul build a temple of marble. 
Nore 1.—In poetry the preposition is often omitted. 
Norr 2.—The Ablative of Material is a development of the Ablative of Source. 
For the Genitive of Material, see § 344. 
a. Participles denoting birth or origin are followed by the Abla- 
tive of Source, generally without a preposition :—* 
Tove natus et Maia (N. D. iii. 56), son of Jupiter and Maia. 
édite régibus (Hor. Od. i. 1. 1), descendant of kings. 
quo sanguine crétus (Aen. ii. 74), born of what blood. 
genitae Pandione (Ov. M. vi. 666), daughters of Pandion. 
Nore 1.—A preposition (ab, dé, ex) is usually expressed with pronouns, with the 
name of the mother, and often with that of other ancestors: — 
ex mé hic natus non est sed ex fratre med (Ter. Ad. 40), this is not my son, but 
my brother’s (not born from me, ete.). 
cum ex utraque [uxdre] filius natus esset (De Or. i. 183), each wife having had 
a son (when a son had been born of each wife). 
Bélus et omnés 4 Béld (Aen. i. 730), Belus and all his descendants. 
Nore 2.—Rarely, the place of birth is expressed by the ablative of source: as, — 
désideravit C. Fleginatem Placentia, A. Grinium Puteolis (B. C. iii. 71), he lost Caius 
Fleginas of Placentia, Aulus Granius of Puteoli. 
Norse 3.—The Roman tribe is regularly expressed by the ablative alone: as,— 
Q. Verrem Romilia (Verr. i. 23), Quintus Verres of the Romilian tribe. 
b. Some verbs may take the Ablative of Material without a prep- 
osition. Such are cdnstare, cdnsistere, and continéri.? But with con- 
stare, ex is more common : — 
domiis amoenitas n6n aedificié sed silva constabat (Nep. Att. 13), the charm 
of the house consisted not in the buildings but in the woods. 
ex animé constamus et corpore (Fin. iv. 19), we consist of soul and body. 
vita corpore et spiritii continétur (Marc. 28), life consists of body and spirit. 
ce. The Ablative of Material without a preposition is used with 
facere, fieri, and similar words, in the sense of do with, become of: — 
quid hdc homine faciatis (Verr. ii. 1. 42), what are you going to do with this 
man? 
quid Tulliola mea fiet (Fam. xiv. 4. 3), what will become of my dear Tullia? 
quid té futirum est (Verr. ii. 155), what will become of you? 
    1 As natus, satus, Sditus, genitus, ortus, 
2 The ablative with consistere and contini atus, generatus, crétus, credtus, oriundus. 
is probably locative in origin (cf. § 431).

  252 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [s§ 408, 404 
d. The Ablative of Material with ex, and in poetry without a 
preposition, sometimes depends directly on a noun : — 
non pauca pocula ex aurd (Verr. iv. 62), not a few cups of gold. 
scopulis pendentibus antrum (Aen. i. 166), a cave of hanging rocks. 
For Ablative of Source instead of Partitive Genitive, see § 346. c. 
Ablative of Cause 
404. The Ablative (with or without a preposition) is used to 
express Cause : —1 
neglegentia plectimur (Lael. 85), we are chastised for negligence. 
gubernatoris ars atilitate non arte lauddtur (Fin. i. 42), the pilot’s skill is 
praised for its service, not its skill. 
certis dé causis, for cogent reasons. 
ex vulnere aeger (Rep. ii. 38), disabled by (from) a wound. 
mare 4 sole lucet (Acad. ii. 105), the sea gleams in the sun (from the sun). 
a, The Ablative of Cause without a preposition is used with labéré 
(also with ex), exsilid, exsultd, triumphs, lacrimo, arded : — 
doled té aliis malis laborare (Fam. iv. 3), I am sorry that you suffer with 
other ills. [Cf. ex aere aliénd labdrare (B. C. iii. 22), to labor under 
debt (from another’s money).] 
exsultare laetitid, triumphare gaudid coepit (Clu. 14), she began to exult in 
gladness, and triumph in joy. 
exsilui gaudid (Fam. xvi. 16), I jumped for joy. [Cf. lacrimd gaudié (Ter. 
Ad. 409), I weep for joy.] 
ardére dolore et ira (Att. ii. 19. 5), to be on fire with pain and anger. 
For gaudes and glirior, see § 431. 
6. The motive which influences the mind of the person acting is 
expressed by the ablative of cause; the object exciting the emotion 
often by ob? or propter with the accusative : — 
ndn ob praedam aut spoliandi cupidine (Tac. H. i. 63), not for booty or through 
lust of plunder. : 
amicitia ex sé et propter sé expetenda (Fin. ii. 83), friendship must be sought 
of and for itself. 
Notr.—But these constructions are often confused: as,—parére légibus propter 
metum (Par. 34), to obey the laws on account of fear. [Here metum is almost equiva- 
lent to ‘‘the terrors of the law,” and hence propter is used, though the ablative would 
be more natural.] 
1 The cause, in the ablative, is originally source, as is shown by the use of ab, dé, 
ex; but when the accusative with ad, ob, is used, the idea of cause arises from nearness. 
Occasionally it is difficult to distinguish between cause and means (which is the old 
Instrumental case) or circumstance (which is either the Locative or the Instrumental). 
2 Originally a mercantile use: cf. ob decem minds, for the price of ten minx.
-P-A-G-E-265
  §§ 404, 405] ABLATIVE OF AGENT 253 
ce. The ablatives causa and gratia, for the sake of, are used with a 
genitive preceding, or with a pronoun in agreement : — 
ea causa, on account of this; qua gratia (Ter. Eun. 99), for what purpose ? 
mea causa, for my sake; mea gratia (Plaut.), for my sake. 
ex mea et rei piiblicae causa, for my own sake and the republic’s. 
praedictidnis causa (N. D. iii. 5), by way of prophecy. 
exempli gratia (verbi gratia), for example. 
sui pirgandi gratia, for the sake of clearing themselves. 
Norr.— But gratia with possessives in this use is rare. 
Ablative of Agent 
405. The Voluntary Agent after a passive verb is expressed by 
the Ablative with 4 or ab: — 
laudatur ab his, culpatur ab illis (Hor. S. i. 2. 11), he is praised by these, 
blamed by those. : 
ab animé tud quidquid agitur id agitur 4 té (Tusc. i. 52), whatever is done by 
your soul is done by yourself. 
4 filiis in ifidicium vocatus est (Cat. M. 22), he was brought to trial by his sons. 
cum 4 ciinctd cénsessii plausus esset multiplex datus (id. 64), when great 
applause had been given by the whole audience. 
né yirtiis ab audacia vincerétur (Sest. 92), that valor might not be overborne 
by audacity. [Audacia is in a manner personified. ] 
Nore 1.—This construction is developed from the Ablative of Source. The agent 
is conceived as the source or author of the action. 
Nore 2.—The ablative of the agent (which requires 4 or ab) must be carefully 
distinguished from the ablative of instrument, which has no preposition (§ 409). Thus 
—occisus gladid, slain by a sword; but, occisus ab hoste, slain by an enemy. 
Nore 3.—The ablative of the agent is commonest with nouns denoting persons, but 
it occurs also with names of things or qualities when these are conceived as performing 
an action and so are partly or wholly personified, as in the last example under the rule. 
a. ‘The ablative of the agent with ab is sometimes used after intran- 
sitive verbs that have a passive sense : — 
perire ab hoste, to be slain by an enemy. 
b. The personal agent, when considered as instrument or means, 
is often expressed by per with the accusative, or by opera with a 
genitive or possessive : — 
ab exploratoribus certior factus est (B. G. i. 21), he was informed by scouts (in 
person). But, — : 
per exploratérés Caesar certior factus est (id. i. 12), Cesar was informed by 
(means of) scouts. 
élautae opera Neptini (Plaut. Rud. 699), washed clean by the services of Neptune. 
nOdn me opera événit (Ter. Hec. 228), it hasn’t happened through me (by my 
exertions). [Cf. éius opera, B. G. v. 27.]
-P-A-G-E-266
  254 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES _ [S$ 405-407 
Nor 1.—The ablative of means or instrument is often used instead of the abla. 
tive of agent, especially in military phrases: as,—haec excubitoribus tenébantur 
(B. G. vii. 69), these (redoubts) were held by means of sentinels. 
Notr 2.— An animal is sometimes regarded as the means or instrument, some- 
timesas the agent. Hence both the simple ablative and the ablative with ab occur: — 
equd vehi, do ride on horseback (be conveyed by means of a horse). [Not ab equd.] 
clipeds 4 miribus esse dérdsds (Div. i. 99), that the shields were gnawed by mice. 
For the Dative of the Agent with the Gerundive, see § 374. 
Ablative of Comparison 
406. The Comparative degree is often followed by the Abla- 
tive} signifying than : — 
Catd est Ciceréne Gloquentior, Cato is more eloquent than Cicero. 
quid ndbis dudbus laboridsius est (Mil. 5), what more burdened with toil than 
we two? 
vilius argentum est aurd, virtitibus aurum (Hor. Ep. i. 1. 52), silver is less 
precious than gold, gold than virtue. 
a. The idiomatic ablatives opinidne, spé, solitd, dictd, aequd, crédi- 
bili, and ivistd are used after comparatives instead of a clause : — 
celerius opinine (Fam. xiv. 23), faster than one would think. 
sérius spé omnium (Liv. xxvi. 26), later than all hoped (than the hope of all). 
amnis solité citatior (id. xxiii. 19. 11), a stream swifter than its wont. 
gravius aequd (Sall. Cat. 51), more seriously than was right. 
407. The comparative may be followed by quam, than. When 
quam is used, the two things compared are put in the same case : 
non callidior es quam hic (Rosc. Am. 49), you are not more cunning than he. 
cdntidnibus accommodatior est quam iiidiciis (Clu. 2), fitter for popular assem- 
blies than for courts. 
misericordia dignior quam contumélia (Pison. 32), more worthy of pity than of 
disgrace. i 
a. The construction with quam is required when the first of the 
things compared is not in the Nominative or Accusative. 
- Norr 1.—There are several limitations on the use of the ablative of comparison, 
even when the first of the things compared is in the nominative or accusative. Thus 
the quam construction is regularly used (1) when the comparative is in agreement 
with a genitive, dative, or ablative: as, —senex est ed melidre condicidne quam adulés- 
céns (Cat. M. 68), an old man is in this respect in a better position than a young man; 
and (2) when the second member of the comparison is modified by a clause: as,— minor 
fuit aliquantd is qui primus fabulam dedit quam ei qui, etc. (Brut. 73), he who first 
presented a play was somewhat younger than those who, ete. 
  1 This is a branch of the Ablative of Separation. The object with which anything 
is compared is the starting-point from which we reckon. Thus, “Cicero is eloquent” ; 
but, starting from him, we come to Cato, who is ‘‘ more so than he.”
-P-A-G-E-267
    
§ 407] ABLATIVE OF COMPARISON 255 
Note 2.—The poets sometimes use the ablative of comparison where the prose 
construction requires quam: as,— pane eged iam mellitis potidre placentis (Hor. Ep. 
i. 10. 11), I now want bread better than honey-cakes. 
Norr 3.—Relative pronouns having a definite antecedent never take quam in this 
construction, but always the ablative: as,—réx erat Aenéis nobis, qué iistior alter 
nec, ete. (Aen. i. 544), Hneas was our king, than whom no other [was] more righteous. 
6. In sentences expressing or implying a general negative the 
ablative (rather than quam) is the regular construction when the first 
member of the comparison is in the nominative or accusative : — 
nihil détestabilius dédecore, nihil foedius servitiite (Phil. iii. 36), nothing is 
more dreadful than disgrace, nothing viler than slavery. 
néminem esse caridrem té (Att. x. 84. 1), that no one is dearer than you. 
e. After the comparatives plis, minus, amplius, longius, without 
quam, a word of measure or number is often used with no change in 
its case : — 
pliis septingenti capti (Liv. xli. 12), more than seven hundred were taken. 
[Nominative.] 
pliis tertia parte interfecta (B. G. iii. 6), more than a third part being slain. 
[Ablative Absolute. ] 
aditus in latitidinem non amplius ducentérum pedum relinquébatur (id. ii. 
29), an approach of not more than two hundred feet in width was left. 
[Genitive of Measure: § 345. b.] 
Norz.— The noun takes the case required by the context, without reference to the 
comparative, which is in a sort of apposition: ‘‘seyven hundred were taken [and] more.” 
d, Alius is sometimes followed by the ablative in poetic and collo- 
quial use; in formal prose it is followed by ac (atque), et, more rarely 
by nisi, quam : — 
nec quicquam aliud libertate commiini (Fam. xi. 2), nothing else than the com- 
mon liberty. 
alius Lysippd (Hor. Ep. ii. 1. 240), another than Lysippus. 
num aliud vidétur esse ac medrum bondrum direptid (Dom. 51), does it seem 
anything different from the plundering of my property? 
erat historia nihil aliud nisi annadlium cdnfectid (De Or. ii. 52), history was: 
nothing else but a compiling of records. 
e. The comparative of an adverb is usually followed by quam, rarely 
by the ablative except in poetry : — 
tempus té citius quam dratid déficeret (Rosc. Am. 89), time would fail you 
sooner than words. But, — 
cur olivum sanguine viperin6 cautius vitat (Hor. Od. i. 8. 9), why does he shun 
oil more carefully than viper’s blood ? 
Nore.— Prepositions meaning before or beyond (as ante, prae, praeter, supra) are 
sometimes used with a comparative: as,—scelere ante alids immanior omnis (Aen. i. 
347), more monstrous in crime than all other men.

  256 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [ss 408, 409 
USES OF THE ABLATIVE AS INSTRUMENTAL 
408. Means, Instrument, Manner, and Accompaniment are denoted by the Instru- 
mental Ablative (see § 398), but some of these usés more commonly require a prepo- 
sition. As they all come from one source (the old Instrumental Case) no sharp line 
can be drawn between them, and indeed the Romans themselves can hardly have 
thought of any distinction. Thus, in omnibus precibus drabant, they entreated with 
every [kind of] prayer, the ablative, properly that of means, cannot be distinguished 
from that of manner. 
Ablative of Means or Instrument 
409. The Ablative is used to denote the means or instrument 
of an action : — 
certantés piignis, calcibus, unguibus, morsii dénique (Tusc. v. 77), fighting 
with fists, heels, nails, and even teeth. 
cum pignis et calcibus concisus esset (Verr. iii. 56), when he had been pum- 
melled with their fists and heels. 
meis labéribus interitii rem piblicam liberavi (Sull. 33), by my toils I have 
saved the state from ruin. 
multae istérum arborum mea mani sunt satae (Cat. M. 59), many of those 
trees were set out with my own hands. 
vi victa vis, vel potius oppressa virtiite audacia est (Mil. 30), violence was 
overcome by violence, or rather, boldness was put down by courage. 
a. The Ablative of Means is used with verbs and adjectives of 
Jjilling, abounding, and the like : — 
Deus bonis omnibus explévit mundum (Tim. 3), God has filled the world with 
all good things. 
aggere et cratibus fossas explent (B. G. vii. 86), they fill up the ditches with 
earth and fascines. 
totum montem hominibus complévit (id. i. 24), he filled the whole mountain 
with men. 
opimus praeda (Verr. ii. 1. 132), rich with spoils. 
vita pléna et conferta voluptatibus (Sest.23), life filled and crowded with delights. 
Forum Appi differtum nautis (Hor. S. i. 5. 4), Forum Appii crammed with 
bargemen. 
Norr.—In poetry the Genitive is often used with these words. Compled and impled 
sometimes take the genitive in prose (ef. § 356); so regularly plénus and (with personal 
nouns) complétus and refertus (§ 349. a): — 
omnia pléna lictis et maeroris fuérunt (Sest. 128), everything was full of grief 
and mourning. 
Ollam dénaridrum implére (Fam. ix. 18), to fill a pot with money. [Here evidently 
colloquial, otherwise rare in Cicero.] 
convivium vicindrum compleé (Cat. M. 46, in the mouth of Cato), I fill up the ban- 
quet with my neighbors. 
eum complétus mercatorum carcer esset (Verr. v. 147), when the prison was full of 
traders. 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
  §§ 410, 411] ABLATIVE OF MEANS OR INSTRUMENT 257 
410. The deponents itor, fruor, fungor, potior, vescor, with several 
of their compounds,! govern the Ablative : — 
iitar vestra benignitate (Arch. 18), I will avail myself of your kindness. 
ita mihi salva ré piblicé vobiscum perfrui liceat (Cat. iv. 11), so may I enjoy 
with you the state secure and prosperous. 
fungi indni minere (Aen. vi. 885), to perform an idle service. 
aurd hérés potitur (Ov. M. vii. 156), the hero takes the gold. 
lacte et ferind carne vescébantur (lug. 89), they fed on milk and game. 
Norr.— This is properly an Ablative of Means (instrumental) and the verbs are 
really in the middle voice (§ 156. a). Thus itor with the ablative signifies J employ 
myself (or avail myself) by means of, etc. But these earlier meanings disappeared 
from the language, leaving the construction as we find it. 
a. Potior sometimes takes the Genitive, as always in the phrase 
potiri rérum, to get control or be master of affairs (§ 357. a): — 
totius Galliae sésé potiri posse spérant (B. G. i. 8), they hope they can get 
possession of the whole of Gaul. 
Nore 1.—In early Latin, these verbs are sometimes transitive and take the 
accusative :— 
fiinctus est officium (Ter. Ph. 281), he performed the part, ete. 
ille patria potitur commoda (Ter. Ad. 871), he enjoys his ancestral estate. 
Note 2.— The Gerundive of these verbs is used personally in the passive as if the 
verb were transitive (but cf. § 500. 3): as, — Héraclid omnia itenda ae possidenda tra- 
diderat (Verr. ii. 46), he had given over everything to Heraclius for his use and posses- 
sion (to be used and possessed). 
411. Opus and iisus, signifying need, take the Ablative:— 
magistratibus opus est (Leg. iii. 5), there is need of magistrates. 
nune viribus fisus (Aen. viii. 441), now there is need of strength. 
Nors.—The ablative with iisus is not common in classic prose. 
a. With opus the ablative of a perfect participle is often found, 
either agreeing with a noun or used as a neuter abstract noun; — 
opus est tua exprompta malitia atque astitia (Ter. And. 723), I must have 
your best cunning and cleverness set to work. 
properats opus erat (cf. Mil. 49), there was need of haste. 
Nore 1.—So rarely with tisus in comedy: as, — quid istis tsust conscriptis (Pl. 
Bacch. 749), what’s the good of having them in writing ? 
Notx 2.— The omission of the noun gives rise to complex constructions: as,— quid 
opus factost (cf. B. G. i. 42), what must be done? [Cf. quid opus est fieri? with quo 
factd opus est ?} 
1 These are abiitor, deiitor (very rare), dfungor, défruor, perfruor, perfungor. 
2 This construction is properly an instrumental one, in which opus and tisus mean 
work and service, and the ablaiive expresses that with which the work is performed 
or the service rendered. The noun isus follows the analogy of the verb ttor, and the 
ablative with opus est appears to be an extension of that with fisus est.
-P-A-G-E-270
  258 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [§§ 411-413 
b. Opus is often found in the predicate, with the thing needed in 
the nominative as subject: — 
dux nobis et auctor opus est (Fam. ii. 6. 4), we need a chief and responsible 
adviser (a chief, etc., is necessary for us). 
si quid ipsi opus esset (B. G. i. 34), if he himself wanted anything (if any- 
thing should be necessary for him). 
quae opus sunt (Cato R. R. 14. 3), things which are required. 
Ablative of Manner 
412. The Manner of an action is denoted by the Ablative ; usu- 
ally with cum, unless a limiting adjective is used with the noun: 
cum celeritate vénit, he came with speed. But, — 
summa celeritate vénit, he came with the greatest speed. 
quid réfert qua mé ratidne cdgatis (Lael. 26), what difference does it make in 
what way you compel me? 
a. But cum is often used even when the ablative has a limiting 
adjective : — 
quanto id cum periculé fécerit (B. G. i. 17), at what risk he did this. 
nn mindre cum taedid recubant (Plin. Ep. ix. 17. 3), they recline with no less 
weariness. 
b. With such words of manner as modo, pacté, ratidne, riti, vi, via, 
and with stock expressions which have become virtually adverbs (as 
silenti6, iire, inifiria), cum is not used : — 
apis Matinae more moddque carmina fingd (Hor. Od. iv. 2. 28), in the style 
and manner of a Matinian bee I fashion songs. 
Norx.—So in poetry the ablative of manner often omits cum: as, —insequitur cu- 
muld aquae mons (Aen. i. 105), a mountain of water follows in a mass. [Cf. murmure 
(id. i. 124) ; rimis (id. i. 123).] 
Ablative of Accompaniment 
413. Accompaniment is denoted by the Ablative, regularly with 
cum : — 
cum coniugibus ac liberis (Att. vili. 2. 8), with wives and children. 
cum funditdribus sagittariisque flimen transgressi (B. G. ii. 19), having 
crossed the river with the archers and slingers. 
quae supplicatis si cum céteris cOnferatur (Cat. iii. 15), if this thanksgiving 
be compared with others. 
quae [léx] esse cum télé vetat (Mil. 11), the law which forbids [one] to go 
armed (be with a weapon). 
si sécum suds édiixerit (Cat. i. 30), if he leads out with him his associates. 
[For sécum, see § 144. b. v.1.]
-P-A-G-E-271
  §§ 418, 414] ABLATIVE OF DEGREE OF DIFFERENCE 259 
a. The ablative is used without cum in some military phrases, and 
here and there by early writers : — 
subsequébatur omnibus copiis (B. G. ii. 19), he followed close with all his 
forces. [But also cum omnibus cdpiis, id. i. 26.] 
hic praesidid profectus est (Verr. ii. 1. 86), with this force he set out. 
Norx. — Misceé and iungs, with some of their compounds, and cénfundé take either 
(1) the Ablative of Accompaniment with or without cum, or (2) sometimes the Dative 
(mostly poetical or late) : — 
mixta dolére voluptas (B. Al. 56), pleasure mingled with pain. 
cflius animum cum sud misceat (Lael. 81), whose soul he may mingle with his own. 
flétumque crudri miscuit (Ov. M. iv. 140), and mingled tears with blood. 
Caesar eas cohortis cum exerciti sud coniiinxit (B. C. i. 18), Caesar united those 
cohorts with his own army. 
aér coniiinctus terris (Lucr. v. 562), air united with earth. 
hiimano6 capiti cervicem equinam iungere (Hor. A. P. 1), to join to a human head 
a horse’s neck. 
b. Words of Contention and the like require cum: — 
armis cum hoste certare (Off. iii. 87), to fight with the enemy in arms. 
libenter haec cum Q. Catuld disputarem (Manil. 66), I should gladly discuss 
these matters with Quintus Catulus. 
Nore. — But words of contention may take the Dative in poetry (see § 368. a). 
Ablative of Degree of Difference 
414, With Comparatives and words implying comparison the 
ablative is used to denote the Degree of Difference: — 
quinque milibus passuum distat, it is five miles distant. 
4 milibus passuum circiter dudbus (B. G. v. 82), at a distance of about two 
miles. [For 4 as an adverb, see § 433. 3.] 
aliquot ante annis (Tusc. i. 4), several years before. 
aliquantd post suspexit (Rep. vi. 9), a while after, he looked up. 
multé mé vigilare acrius (Cat. i. 8), that I watch much more sharply. 
nihild erat ipse Cycléps quam ariés priidentior (Tusc. v. 115), the Cyclops 
himself was not a whit wiser than the ram. 
a. The ablatives qué... ed (hic), and quantd... tantd, are used 
correlatively with comparatives, like the English the... the1: — 
quo minus cupiditatis, ed plis auctéritatis (Liv. xxiv. 28), the less greed, the 
more weight (by what the less, by that the more). 
quanto erat gravior oppiignatid, tantd crébridrés litterae mittébantur (B. G. 
y. 45), the severer the siege was, the more frequently letters were sent. 
1In this phrase the is not the definite article but a pronominal adverb, being the 
Anglo-Saxon thy, the instrumental case of the pronoun thet, that. This pronoun is 
used both as relative (by which, by how much) and as demonstrative (by that, by so 
much). Thus the . . . the corresponds exactly to qué . . . 6.

Norr.—To this construction are doubtless to be referred all cases of qué and ed 
(nde) with a comparative, even when they have ceased to be distinctly felt as degree 
of difference and approach the Ablative of Cause: — 
edque mé minus paenitet (N. D. i. 8), and for that reason I regret less, ete. (by so 
much the less I regret). 
haec ¢6 facilius faciébant, quod (B. G. iii. 12), this they did the more easily for ae 
reason, because, etc. [Cf. hdc maidre spé, quod (id. iii. 9).] 
b. The Ablative of Comparison (§ 406) and the Ablative of Degree 
of Difference are sometimes used together with the same adjective : — 
paulé minus ducentis (B. C. iii. 28), a little less than two hundred. 
patria, quae mihi vita med multé est carior (Cat. i. 27), my country, which 
is much dearer to me than life. 
But the construction with quam is more common. 
Ablative of Quality 
415. The quality of a thing is denoted by the Ablative with an 
adjective or genitive modifier. 
This is called the Descriptive Ablative or Ablative of Quality: 
animé melidre sunt gladiatorés (Cat. ii. 26), the gladiators are of a better 
mind. 
quae cum esset civitds aequissimé itire ac foedere (Arch. 6), as this was a 
city with perfectly equal constitutional rights. 
mulierem eximia pulchritiidine (Verr. ii. 1. 64), a woman of rare beauty. 
Aristotelés, vir summd ingenid, scientia, copia (Tuse. i. 7), Aristotle, a man of 
the greatest genius, learning, and gift of expression. 
dé Domitid dixit versum Graecum eddem sententia (Deiot. 25), concerning 
Domitius he recited a Greek line of the same tenor. 
Norer.— The Ablative of Quality (like the Genitive of Quality, § 345) modifies a sub- 
stantive by describing it. It is therefore equivalent to an adjective, and may be either 
attributive or predicate. In this it differs from other ablatives, which are equivalent 
to adverbs. 
a. In expressions of quality the Genitive or the Ablative may 
often be used indifferently ; but physical qualities are oftener denoted 
. by the Ablative (cf. § 345. n.): — 
; capilld sunt prémissd (B. G. vy. 14), they have long hair. 
ut capite operté sit (Cat. M. 34), to have his head covered (to be with covered 
head). 
quam fuit inbécillus P. Africani filius, quam tenui aut nalla potius valétidine 
(id. 35), how weak was the son of Africanus, of what feeble health, or 
rather none at all! 
1 It was originally instrumental and appears to have developed from accompani- 
ment (§ 418) and manner (§ 412). 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  §§ 416, 417] ABLATIVE OF PRICE : 261 
Ablative of Price 
416. The price of a thing is put in the Ablative : — 
agrum véndidit séstertium sex milibus, he sold the land for 6000 sesterces. 
Antonius régna addixit pecinia (Phil. vii. 15), Antony sold thrones for money. 
logis ridiculds: quis céna poscit (Pl. Stich. 221), jokes: who wants them for 
(at the price of) a dinner? 
magnd illi ea ciinctatis stetit (Liv. ii. 36), that hesitation cost him dear. 
Nore. —To this head is to be referred the Ablative of the Penalty (§ 353. 1). 
417. Certain adjectives of quantity are used in the Genitive to 
denote indefinite value. Such are magni, parvi, tanti, quanti, pliris, 
minoris : — 
mea magni interest, it is of great consequence to me. 
illud parvi réfert (Manil. 18), this is of small account. 
est mihi tanti (Cat. ii. 15), i is worth the price (it is of so much). 
Verrésne tibi tanti fuit (Verr. ii. 1. 77), was Verres of so much account to 
you? 
tantdne minéris decumae véniérunt (id. iii. 106), were the tithes sold for so 
much less ? 
ut té redimas captum quam queas minim6 : si nequeas paululs, at quanti queas 
(Ter. Eun. 74), to ransom yourself, when captured, at the cheapest rate 
you can; if you can’t for a small sum, then at any rate for what you can. 
Nor. —These are really Genitives of Quality (§ 345. b). 
a. The genitive of certain colorless nouns is used to denote indefi- 
nite value. Such are nihili (nili), nothing; assis, a farthing (rare) ; 
flocci (a lock of wool), a straw : — 
non flocci facid (Att. xiii. 50), I care not a straw. [Colloquial.] 
utinam ego istuc abs té factum nili penderem (Ter. Eun. 94), O that I cared 
nothing for this being done by you! [Colloquial.] 
b. With verbs of exchanging, either the thing taken or the thing 
given in exchange may be in the Ablative of Price. Such are mito, 
commiutd, permiitd, vertd : — 
fidem suam et religidnem pecinia commitare (Clu. 129), to barter his faith 
and conscience for money. 
exsilium patria séde miitavit (Q. C. iii. 7. 11), he exchanged his native land 
for evile (he took exile in exchange for his native land). 
vélox saepe Lucrétilem miitat Lycaed Faunus (Hor. Od. i. 17. 1), nimble 
Faunus often changes Lyceus for Lucretilis. [He takes Lucretilis at 
the price of Lyceus, i.e. he goes from Lyczus to Lucretilis. ] 
vertere fineribus triumphis (id. i. 35. 4), to change the triumph to the funeral 
train (exchange triumphs for funerals). [Poetical.]

  262 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES _ [S$§ 417, 418 
Nore. — With verbs of exchanging cum is often used, perhaps with a different con- 
ception of the action: as, —ariés . . . cum croced miitabit vellera litd (Hcl. iv. 44), the 
ram shall change his fleece for [one dyed with] the yellow sagron. 
ec. With verbs of buying and selling the simple Ablative of Price 
must be used, except in the case of tanti, quanti, pliris, mindris : — 
quanti eam émit? vili. . . quot minis? quadraginta minis (Pl. Epid. 51), 
what did he buy her for? Cheap. For how many mine? Forty. 
Ablative of Specification 
418. The Ablative of Specification denotes that im respect to 
which anything is or is done : — 
virtite praecédunt (B. G. i. 1), they excel in courage. 
claudus alterd pede (Nep. Ages. 8), lame of one foot. 
lingua haesitantés, vice absoni (De Or. i. 115), hesitating in speech, harsh in 
voice. 
sunt enim hominés non ré sed nodmine (Off. i. 105), for they are men not in 
fact, but in name. 
maior nati, older; minor nati, younger (cf. § 181. c). 
paulum aetate progressi (Cat. M. 33), somewhat advanced in age. 
corpore senex esse poterit, animd numquam erit (id. 38), he may be an old man 
in body, he never will be [old] at heart. 
a. To this head are to be referred many expressions where the abla- 
tive expresses that in accordance with which anything is or is done: — 
med ire, with perfect right ; but, med modé, in my fashion. 
mea sententia, in my opinion; but also more formally, ex mea sententia. 
[Here the sense is the same, but the first ablative is specification, the 
second source. ] 
propinquitate coniiinctds atque natira (Lael. 50), closely allied by kindred and 
nature. [Here the ablative is not different in sense from those above, 
but no doubt is a development of means. ] 
qui vincit viribus (id. 55), who surpasses in strength. [Here it is impossible 
to tell whether viribus is the means of the superiority or that in respect 
to which one is superior. ] 
Nors.— As the Romans had no such categories as we make, it is impossible to 
classify all uses of the ablative. The ablative of specification (originally instru- 
mental) is closely akin to that of manner, and shows some resemblance to means and 
vause. 
For the Supine in -i as an Ablative of Specification, see § 510. 
b. The adjectives dignus and indignus take the ablative : — 
vir patre, avd, maidribus suis dignissimus (Phil. iii. 25), a man most worthy 
of his father, grandfather, and ancestors. 
té omni honére indignissimum itdicdvit (Vat. 39), he judged you entirely 
unworthy of every honor.

Nore 1.—So the verb dignor in poetry and later prose: as, —haud equidem tali mé 
dignor honGre (Aen. i. 335), I do not deem myself worthy of such an honor. 
Nore 2.— Dignus and indignus sometimes take the genitive in colloquial usage and 
in poetry :— 
ciram dignissimam tuae virtiitis (Balbus in Att. viii. 15), care most worthy of 
your noble character. 
dignus salitis (Plaut. Trin. 1153), worthy of safety. 
magnorum haud umquam indignus avorum (Aen. xii. 649), never unworthy of my 
great ancestors. 
Ablative Absolute 
419. A noun or pronoun, with a participle in agreement, may 
be put in the Ablative to define the time or cirewmstances of an 
action. This construction is called the Ablative Absolute: —1 
Caesar, acceptis litteris, niintium mittit (B. G. v. 46), having received the 
letter, Cesar sends a messenger (the letter having been received). 
quibus rébus cognitis Caesar apud milités cdntidnatur (B. C. i. 7), having 
learned this, Cesar makes a speech to the soldiers. 
fugatd omni equitata (B. G. vii. 68), all the cavalry being put to flight. 
interfectd Inditiomaré (id. vi. 2), wpon the death of Indutiomarus. 
nodndum hieme cénfecta in finis Nervidrum contendit (id. vi. 8), though the 
winter was not yet over, he hastened into the territory of the Nervii. 
compressi [sunt] cOnatiis nilld tumult piiblicé concitatd (Cat. i, 11), the 
attempts were put down without exciting any general alarm. 
né vobis quidem omnibus ré etiam tum probata (id. ii. 4), since at that time 
the facts were not yet proved even to all of you. 
Notr.—The ablative absolute is an adverbial modifier of the predicate. It is, 
however, not grammatically dependent on any word in the sentence: hence its name 
absolute (absolitus, i.e. free or unconnected). A substantive in the ablative absolute 
very seldom denotes a person or thing elsewhere mentioned in the same clause. 
  a. An adjective, or a second noun, may take the place of the parti- 
ciple in the Ablative Absolute construction : —? 
exigua parte aestatis reliqua (B. G. iv. 20), when but a small part of the sum- 
mer was left (a small part of the summer remaining). 
L. Domitis Ap. Claudid consulibus (id. v. 1), in the consulship of Lucius Domi- 
tius and Appius Claudius (Lucius Domitius and Appius Claudius [being] 
consuls). [The regular way of expressing a date, see § 424. g.] 
nil déspérandum Teucrd duce et auspice Teucrd (Hor. Od. i. 7. 27), there 
should be no despair under Teucer’s leadership and auspices (Teucer 
being leader, etc.). 
1The Ablative Absolute is perhaps of instrumental origin. It is, however, some- 
times explained as an outgrowth of the Jocative, and in any event certain locative 
constructions (of place and time) must have contributed to its development. 
2 The present participle of esse, wanting in Latin (§ 170. ), is used in Sanskrit and 
Greek as in English.
-P-A-G-E-276
  264 SYNTAX: CONSTRUCTION OF CASES [8§ 419, 420 
6. A phrase or clause, used substantively, sometimes occurs as 
ablative absolute with a participle or an adjective : — 
incertd quid peterent (Liv. xxviii. 36), as it was uncertain what they should 
aim at (it being uncertain, etc.). 
compertd vanum esse formidinem (Tac. Ann. i. 66), when it was found that 
the alarm was groundless. 
cir praetereatur démonstraté (Inv. ii. 34), when the reason for omitting it has 
been explained (why it is passed by being explained). 
Nors. — This construction is very rare except in later Latin. 
c, A participle or an adjective is sometimes used adverbially in 
the ablative absolute without a substantive : — 
cOnsultd (Off. i. 27), on purpose (the matter having been deliberated on). 
mihi optatd véneris (Att. xiii. 28. 3), you will come in accordance with my 
wish. 
serénd (Liv. xxxi. 12), wnder a clear sky (it [being] clear). 
nec auspicatd nec litatd (id. v. 38), with no auspices or favorable sacrifice. 
tranquillé, ut 4iunt, quilibet gubernator est (Sen. Ep. 85. 34), in good 
weather, as they say, any man’s a pilot. 
420. The Ablative Absolute often takes the place of a Sub- 
ordinate Clause. 
Thus it may replace — 
1. A Temporal Clause (§ 541 ff.) :— 
patre interfecto, [his] father having been killed. [This corresponds to cum 
pater interfectus esset, when his father had been killed. ] 
recentibus sceleris éius vestigiis (Q. C. vii. 1. 1), while the traces of the crime 
were fresh. (Cf. dum recentia sunt vestigia. ] 
2. A Causal Clause (§ 540) : —

verant, consiimpts omni friimentd, concilid coactd cdnsultabant (B. G. 
vii. 77), but those who were under siege at Alesia, since the time, etc., 
had expired, and their grain had been exhausted, calling a council (see 5 
below), consulted together. [Cf. cum diés praeterisset, etc.] . 
Daréus, déspérata pace, ad reparandas viris intendit animum (Q. C. iv. 6. 1), 
Darius, since he despaired of peace, devoted his energies to recruiting 
his forces. [Cf. cum pacem déspéraret.] 
8. A Concessive Clause (§ 527): —

though he (Clodius) opposed, he (Milo) was likely to be elected consul ; 
nay, rather, ete.

region is subdued, we shall be free to run down into that sea.

5. A Clause of Accompanying Circumstance : —

180), of my own accord, without reference to Sextus Roscius (Sextus 
Roscius being put aside), I ask these questions of Chrysogonus. 
nec imperante nec sciente nec praesente domind (Mil. 29), without their master’s 
giving orders, or knowing it, or being present. 
Nore. — As the English Nominative Absolute is far less common than the Abla- 
tive Absolute in Latin, a change of form is generally required in translation. Thus 
the present participle is oftenest to be rendered in English by a relative clause with 
when or while; and the perfect passive participle by the perfect active participle. 
These changes may be seen in the following example: — 
At illi, intermissé spatid, impridenti- 
bus nostris atque occupatis in minitidne 
castrorum, subitd sé ex silvis éiécérunt ; 
impetuque in eds factd qui erant in sta-

stitissent, novd genere piignae perterritis

Cansar, B. G, v. 15. But they, having paused a space, while 
our men were unaware and busied in for- 
tifying the camp, suddenly threw them- 
selves out of the woods; then, making an 
attack upon those who were on guard in 
front of the camp, they fought fiercely ; 
and, though two cohorts had been sent by 
Cesar as reinforcements, after these had 
taken their position (leaving very little 
space of ground between them), as our 
men were alarmed by the strange kind 
of fighting, they dashed most daringly 
through the midst of them and got off 
safe. 
For the Ablative with Prepositions, see § 220. 
THE ABLATIVE AS LOCATIVE 
Ablative of Place 
421. The Locative Case was originally used (literally) to denote the place where 
and (figuratively) to denote the time when (a development from the idea of place). 
But this case was preserved only in names of towns and a few other words, and the 
place where is usually denoted by the Ablative. In this construction the Ablative was, 
no doubt, used at first without a preposition, but afterwards it became associated in 
most instances with the preposition in. 
422. In expressions of Time and Place the Latin shows a 
variety of idiomatic constructions (Ablative, Accusative, and Loe- 
ative), which are systematically treated in § 423 ff.

Time 
423. Time when, or within which, is expressed by the Abla- 
tive; time how long by the Accusative.

constitiita dié, on the appointed day ; prima lice, at daybreak. 
quota hora, at what o’clock? tertia vigilia, in the third watch. 
tribus proximis annis (Iug. 11), within the last three years. 
diébus viginti quinque aggerem exstrixérunt (B. G. vii. 24), within twenty- 
five days they finished building a mound. 
2. Accusative : — 
diés continuds triginta, for thirty days together. 
cum triduum iter fécisset (B. G. ii. 16), when he had marched three days. 
Nore. —The Ablative of Time is oe inits origin (§ 421) ; the Accusative is the 
same as that of the extent of space (§ 425) 
424, Special constructions of time are the following : — 
a, The Ablative of time within which sometimes takes in, and the 
Accusative of time how long per, for greater precision : — 
in diébus proximis decem (Iug. 28), within the neat ten days. 
ladi per decem diés (Cat. iii. 20), games for ten days. 
6. Duration of time is occasionally expressed by the Ablative :— 
milités quinque héris proelium sustinuerant (B. C. i. 47), the men had sus. 
tained the fight five hours. 
Norts. —In this use the period of time is regarded as that within which the act is 
done, and it is only implied that the act lasted through the period. Cf. inter annds 
quattuordecim (B. G. i. 36), for fourteen years. 
e. Time during which or within which may be expressed by the 
Accusative or Ablative of a noun in the singular, with an ordinal 
numeral : — 
quintd dié, within [just] four days (lit. on the fifth day). [The Romans 
counted both ends, see § 631. d.] 
régnat iam sextum annum, he has reigned going on six years. 
d. Many expressions have in Latin the construction of time when, 
where in English the main idea is rather of place : — 
piigna Cannénsi (or, apud Cannas), in the fight at Canne. 
lidis Romanis, at the Roman games. 
omnibus Gallicis bellis, in all the Gallic wars.
-P-A-G-E-279
  §§ 424, 425] TIME AND PLACE 267 
e. In many idiomatic expressions of time, the Accusative with ad, 
in, or sub is used. Such are the following: — 
supplicatid décréta est in Kalendas Ianuarias, a thanksgiving was voted for 
the first of January. 
convénérunt ad diem, they assembled on the [appointed] day. 
ad vesperum, Zill evening ; sub vesperum, towards evening. 
sub idem tempus, about the same time; sub noctem, at nightfall. 
f. Distance of time before or after anything is variously expressed: 
post (ante) trés annés, post tertium annum, trés post annés, tertium post

triennium est cum (trés anni sunt cum), it is three years since. 
octévd ménse quam, the eighth month after (see § 434. n.). 
g. In Dates the phrase ante diem (a. d.) with an ordinal, or the 
ordinal alone, is followed by an accusative, like a preposition; and 
the phrase itself may also be governed by a preposition. 
The year is expressed by the names of the consuls in the ablative 
absolute, usually without a conjunction (§ 419. a):— 
is diés erata. d. v. Kal. Apr. (quintum Kalendas Aprilis) L. Pisbne A. Gabinio 
consulibus (B. G. i. 6), that day was the 5th before the calends of April

‘Oct. 28). 
xv. Kal ake the 15th day before the calends of August (July 18). [Full 
form: quintd decimé dié ante Kalendas. ] 
For the Roman Calendar, see § 631. 
Extent of Space 
425. Extent of Space is expressed by the Accusative : — 
fossas quindecim pedés latas (B. G. vii. 72), trenches fifteen feet broad. 
progressus milia passuum circiter duodecim (id. v. 9), having advanced about 
twelve miles. 
in omni vita su&é quemque 4 récté cdnscientia transversum unguem non 
oportet discédere (quoted in Att. xiii. 20), in all one’s life, one should 
not depart a nail’s breadth from straightforward conscience.

1 Originally all these relations were expressed by the cases alone. The accusative, 
in one of its oldest functions, denoted the end of motion; the ablative, in its proper 
meaning of separation, denoted the place from which, and, in its locative function, the 
place where. The prepositions, originally adverbs, were afterwards added to define 
more exactly the direction of motion (as in to usward, toward us), and by long asso- 
ciation became indispensable except as indicated below.

8. Place where: — 
in hac urbe vitam dégit, he passed his life in this city. 
si in Gallia remanérent (B. G. iv. 8), if they remained in Gaul.

oppidum in insula positum (id. vii. 58), a town situated on an island. 
427. With names of towns and small islands, and with domus 
and ris, the Relations of Place are expressed as follows: — 
1. The place from which, by the Ablative without a preposition. 
2. The place to which, by the Accusative without a preposition. 
3. The place where, by the Locative.t 
Examples are : — 
1. Place from which : — 
Roma profectus, having set out from Rome; Rima abesse, to be absent from 
Rome. 
dom6 abire, to leave home ; rire reversus, having returned from the country. 
2. Place to which : — 
cum Rémam sext6d dié Mutina vénisset (Fam. xi. 6. 1), when he had come to 
Rome from Modena in five days (on the sixth day). 
Déld Rhodum navigare, to sail from Delos to Rhodes.

which are used (like names of towns) without a preposition : — 
belli, militiae (in contrast to domi), abroad, in military service. 
humi, on the ground. vesperi (-e), in the evening. 
foris, out of doors. animi (see § 358).

1 The Locatiye has in the singular of the first and second declensions the same form 
as the Genitive, in the plural and in the third declension the same form as the Dative 
or Ablative. (See p. 34, footnote.) 
2The English home in this construction is, like domum, an old accusative of the 
end of motion.

428. Special uses of place from which, to which, and where are 
the following : — 
a. With names of towns and small islands ab is often used to 
denote from the vicinity of, and ad to denote towards, to the neighbor- 
hood of :— 
ut 4 Mutina discéderet (Phil. xiv. 4), that he should retire from Modena 
(which he was besieging). 
erat 4 Gergovid déspectus in castra (B. G. vii. 45), there was from about 
Gergovia a view into the camp. 
ad Alesiam proficiscuntur (id. vii. 76), they set out for Alesia. 
ad Alesiam perveniunt (id. vii. 79), they arrive at Alesia (i.e. in the neighbor- 
hood of the town). 
D. Laelius cum classe ad Brundisium vénit (B. C. iii. 100), Decimus Lelius 
came to Brundisium with a fleet (arriving in the harbor). 
b. The general words urbs, oppidum, insula require a preposition 
to express the place from which, to which, or where : — 
ab (ex) urbe, from the city. in urbe, in the city. 
ad urbem, to the city. Romae in urbe, in the city of Rome. 
in urbem, into the city. Roma ex urbe, from the city of Rome. 
ad urbem R6mam (Rémam ad urbem), to the city of Rome. 
c. With the name of a country, ad denotes to the borders ; in with 
the accusative, into the country itself. Similarly ab denotes away 
from the outside ; ex, out of the interior. e 
Thus ad Italiam pervénit would mean he came to the frontier, regardless of 
the destination ; in Italiam, he went to Italy, i.e. to a place within it, to Rome, 
for instance. 
So ab Italia profectus est would mean he came away from the frontier, regard- 
less of the original starting-point; ex Italia, he came from Italy, from within, as 
from Rome, for instance. 
d. With all names of places at, meaning near (not in), is expressed 
by ad or apud with the accusative. 
piigna ad Cannas, the fight at Cannae. 
conchas ad Céiétam legunt (De Or. ii. 22), aé Caieta (along the shore). 
ad (apud) inferés, in the world below (near, or among, those below). 
ad foris, at the doors. ad ianuam, at the door. 
Norse 1.— Jn the neighborhood of may be expressed by circa with the accusative; 
among, by apud with the accusative : — 
apud Graecés, among the Greeks. apud mé, at my house. 
apud Solénsis (Leg. ii. 41), at Soli. circa Capuam, round about Capua. 
Nore 2.—In citing an author, apud is regularly used; in citing a particular work, 
in. Thus,—apud Xenophéntem, in Xenophon; but, in Xenophdntis Oeconomicd, in 
Xenophon’s Céconomicus.

fords (used as adverb), out: as, — fords égredi, to go out of doors. 
suppetias advenire, to come to one’s assistance. 
gj. When two or more names of place are used with a verb of motion, 
each must be under its own construction : —

terras défertur (Rose. Am. 20), within four days after this was done, the 
matter was reported ro Chrysogonus 1n Sulla’s camp ar Volaterre.

pridentia fidéns (Off. i. 81), trusting in prudence. 
Notr.—The ablative with these verbs sometimes takes the preposition in (but 
fidd in is late), and the ablative with them is probably locative. Thus, —in quibus 
causa nititur (Cael. 25), on whom the case depends. 
With several of these verbs the neuter Accusative of pronouns is often found. For 
fidd and confidd with the Dative, see § 367.

-P-A-G-E-288
  276 SYNTAX: THE VERB [s 436 
SYNTAX OF THE VERB 
MOODS AND TENSES 
436. The Syntax of the Verb relates chiefly to the use of the Moods (which express 
the manner in which the action is conceived) and the Tenses (which express the time of 
theaction). There is no difference in origin between mood and tense; and hence the 
uses of mood and tense frequently cross each other. Thus the tenses sometimes have 
modal significations (compare indicative in apodosis, § 517. ¢; future for imperative, 
§ 449. b); and the moods sometimes express time (compare subjunctive in future con- 
ditions, § 516. b, and notice the want of a future subjunctive). 
The parent language had, besides the Imperative mood, two or more forms with 
modal signification. Of these, the Subjunctive appears with two sets of termina- 
tions, -d-m, -d-s, in the present tense (moneam, dicam), and -é-m, ~é-s, in the present 
(amem) or other tenses (essem, dixissem), The Optative was formed by ié-,i-, with the 
present stem (sim, duim) or the perfect (dixerim). (See details in §§ 168, 169.) 
Each mood has two general classes or ranges of meaning. The uses of the Sub- 
junctive may all be classed under the general ideas of will gr desire and of action 
vividly conceived; and the uses of the Optative under the general ideas of wish and 
of action vaguely conceived. 
It must not be supposed, however, that in any given construction either the sub- 
junctive or the optative was deliberately used because it denoted conception or possi- 
bility. On the contrary, each construction has had its own line of development from 
more tangible and literal forms of thought to more vague and ideal; and by this 
process the mood used came to have in each case a special meaning, which was after- 
wards habitually associated with it in that construction. Similar developments have 
taken place in English. Thus, the expression I would do this has become equivalent 
to a mild command, while by analysis it is seen to be the apodosis of a present condi- 
tion contrary to fact (§ 517): if I were you, ete. By further analysis, J would do is 
seen to have meant, originally, I should have wished (or I did wish) to do. 
In Latin, the original Subjunctive and the Optative became confounded in meaning 
and in form, and were merged in the Subjunctive, at first in the present tense. Then 
new tense-forms of the subjunctive were formed,! and to these the original as well as 
the derived meanings of both moods became attached (see § 438). All the independent 
uses of the Latin subjunctive are thus to be accounted for. 
The dependent uses of the subjunctive haye arisen from the employment of some 
independent subjunctive construction in connection with a main statement. Most fre- 
quently the main statement is prefixed to a sentence containing a subjunctive, as 
a more complete expression of a complex idea (§ 268). Thus a question implying a 
general negative (quin rogem? why should n’t I ask?) might have the general nega- 
tive expressed in a prefixed statement (niilla causa est, there is no reason) ; or abeat, 
let him go away, may be expanded into sine abeat. When such a combination comes 
into habitual use, the original meaning of the subjunctive partially or wholly dis- 
appears and a new meaning arises by implication. Thus, in misit légatds qui dicerent, 
he sent ambassadors to say (i.e. who should say), the original hortatory sense of the 
subjunctive is partially lost, and the mood becomes in part an expression of purpose. 
Similar processes may be seen in the growth of Apodosis. ‘Thus, tole hanc opinidnem, 
luctum sustuleris, remove this notion, you will have done away with grief (i.e. if you 
remove, etc.).

§§ 436, 437] INDICATIVE MOOD 277 
The Infinitive is originally a verbal noun (§ 451), modifying a verb like other nouns: 
vol6 vidére, lit. “‘I wish for-seeing”’: compare English “ what went ye out for to see?” 
But in Latin it has been surprisingly developed, so as to have forms for tense, and some 
proper modal characteristics, and to be used as a substitute for finite moods. 
The other noun and adjective forms of the verb have been developed in various 
ways, which are treated under their respective heads below. 
The proper Verbal Constructions may be thus classified : — 
I. Indicative: Direct Assertion or Question (§ 437). 
1. Exhortation or Command (§ 439).

INDICATIVE MOOD 
437. The Indicative is the mood of direct assertions or ques- 
tions when there is no modification of the verbal idea except that 
of time. 
a. The Indicative is sometimes used where the English idiom 
would suggest the Subjunctive : — 
longum est, it ‘would be tedious [if, etc.]; satius erat, it would have been bet- 
ter [if, etc.]; persequi possum, I might follow up [in detail], 
Nore. — Substitutes for the Indicative are (1) the Historical Infinitive (§ 463), and 
(2) the Infinitive in Indirect Discourse (§ 580).

SUBJUNCTIVE IN INDEPENDENT SENTENCES 
Hortatory Subjunctive 
439. The Hortatory Subjunctive is used in the present tense 
to express an exhortation or a command. The negative is né. 
hos latronés interficiamus (B. G. vii. 38), let us kill these robbers. 
caveant intemperantiam, meminerint verécundiae (Off. i. 122), let them shun 
excess and cherish modesty. 
Nore 1.—The hortatory subjunctive occurs rarely in the perfect (except in pro- 
hibitions: § 450): as,—Epiciirus hic viderit (Acad: ii. 19), let Epicurus look to this. 
Nore 2.— The term hortatory subjunctive is sometimes restricted to the first per- 
son plural, the second and third persons being designated as the jussive subjunctive ; 
but the constructions are substantially identical. 
1 These modifications are of various kinds, each of which has had its own special 
development (cf. § 436). The subjunctive in Latin has also many idiomatic uses (as in 
clauses of Result and Time) where the English does not modify the verbal idea at all, 
but expresses it directly. In such cases the Latin merely takes a different view of 
the action and has developed the construction differently from the English.

  §§ 439, 440] HORTATORY SUBJUNCTIVE 279 
Nore 3.— Once in Cicero and occasionally in the poets and later writers the nega- 
tive with the hortatory subjunctive is ndn: as, —a légibus non recédamus (Clu. 155), let 
us not abandon the laws. 
a. The Second Person of the hortatory.subjunctive is used only 
of an indefinite subject, except in prohibitions, in early Latin, and in 
poetry :— 
initirias fortinae, quis ferre nequeas, défugiendd relinquas (Tusc. v. 118), the 
wrongs of fortune, which you cannot bear, leave behind by flight. 
exoridre aliquis ultor (Aen. iv. 625), rise, some avenger. 
isté bond itare dum adsit, cum absit né requiras (Cat. M. 88), use this bless- 
ing while it is present; when it is wanting do not regret it. 
doceds iter et sacra dstia pandas (Aen. vi. 109), show us the way and lay open 
the sacred portals, 
For Negative Commands (prohibitions), see § 450. 
b. The Imperfect and Pluperfeet of the hortatory subjunctive 
ence an unfulfilled obligation in past time : — 
morerétur, inquiés (Rab. Post. 29), he should have died, you will say. 
potius docéret (Off. iii. 88), he should rather have taught. 
né poposcissés (Att. ii. 1. 3), you should not have asked. 
saltem aliquid dé pondere détraxisset (Fin. iv. 57), at least he should have 
taken something from the weight. 
Nors 1.—In this construction the Pluperfect usually differs from the Imperfect 
only in more clearly representing the time for action as momentary or as past. 
Nore 2.—This use of the subjunctive is carefully to be distinguished from the 
potential use (§ 446). The difference is indicated by the translation, should or ought 
(not would or might). 
440. The Hortatory Subjunctive is used to express a conces- 
sion The Present is used for present time, the Perfect for past. 
The negative is né. 
sit ffir, sit sacrilegus: at est bonus imperator (Verr. v. 4), grant he is a 
thief, a godless wretch: yet he is a good general. 
fuerit aliis; tibi quando esse coepit (Verr. ii. 1. 37), suppose he was [so] to 
others; when did he begin to be to you? 
némd is umquam fuit: né fuerit (Or. 101), there never was such a one [you 
will say]: granted (let there not have been). 
né sit summum malum dolor, malum certé est (Tuse. ii. Nd granted that 
pain is not the greatest evil, at least it is an evil. 
Norn.— The concessive subjunctive with quamvis and licet is originally hortatory 
(§ 527. a, b). 
For other methods of expressing Concession, see § 527. 
For the Hortatory Subjunctive denoting a Proviso, see § 528. a. 
1 Many scholars regard the concessive subjunctive as a development of the Optative 
Subjunctive in a wish. 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
  280 SYNTAX: THE VERB [$§ 441, 442 
Optative Subjunctive 
441. The Optative Subjunctive is used to express a Wish. The 
present tense denotes the wish as possible, the imperfect as wnac- 
complished in present time, the pluperfect as wnaccomplished in 
past time. The negative is né: — 
ita vivam (Att. v. 15), as true as I live, so may I live. 
ne vivam si sci (id. iv. 16. 8), I wish I may not live if I know. 
di té perduint (Deiot. 21), the gods confound thee! 
valeant, valeant civés mei; sint incolumés (Mil. 93), farewell, Farewell to my 
Sellow-citizens ; may they be secure from harm. 
di facerent sine patre forem (Ov. M. viii. 72), would that the gods allowed me 
to be without a father (but they do not)! 
a, The perfect pubjanetive in a wish is archaic : — 
di faxint (Fam. xiv. 8. 3), may the gods grant. 
quod di 6men Soatorist (Phil. xii. 14, in a religious formula), and may the 
gods avert this omen. 
442, The Optative Subjunctive is often preceded by the par- 
ticle utinam; so regularly in the imperfect and pluperfect : — 
falsus utinam vités sim (Livy. xxi. 10. 10), I wish I may be a false prophet. 
utinam Clodius viveret (Mil. 103), would that Clodius were now alive. 
utinam mé mortuum vidissés (Q. Fr. i. 3. 1), would you had seen me dead. 
utinam né véré scriberem (Fam. v. 17. 3), would that I were not writing the 
truth. 
Nore. —Utinam non is occasionally used instead of utinam né: as, —utinam sus- 
ceptus ndn essem (Att. ix. 9. 3), would that I had not been born. 
a. In poetry and old Latin uti or ut often introduces the optative 
subjunctive; and in poetry si or 6 si with the subjunctive sometimes 
expresses a wish : — 
ut pereat positum rdbigine télum (Hor. S. ii. 1. 43), may the weapon unused 
perish with rust. ’ 
6 si angulus ille accédat (id. ii. 6. 8), O if that corner might only be added! 
si nunc sé nobis ille aureus ramus ostendat (Aen. vi. 187), if now that golden 
branch would only show itself to us ! 
Nore 1.—The subjunctive with uti (ut) or utinam was originally deliberative, 
meaning how may J, etc. (§ 444). The subjunctive with si or 6 si is a protasis (§ 512. a), 
the apodosis not being expressed. 
Note 2.— The subjunctive of wish without a particle is seldom found in the imper- 
fect or pluperfect except by sequence of tenses in Indirect Discourse (§ 585): as,—ac 
venerata Cerés, ita culm6 surgeret alt (Hor. S. ii. 2. 124), and Ceres worshipped [with 
libations] that so she might rise with tall stalk. [In addressing the goddess directly 
the prayer would be: ita surgas.]
-P-A-G-E-293
  §§ 442-444] DELIBERATIVE SUBJUNCTIVE, 281 
6. Velim and vellem, and their compounds, with a subjunctive or 
infinitive, are often equivalent to an optative subjunctive : — 
velim tibi persuadeds (Fam. ix. 13. 2), I should like to have you believe (I 
should wish that you would persuade yourself). 
dé Menedémé vellem vérum fuisset, dé régina velim vérum sit (Att. xv. 4. 4), 
about Menedemus I wish it had been true; about the queen I wish it may be. 
ndllem accidisset tempus (Fam. iii. 10. 2), I wish the time never had come. 
mAallem Cerberum metuerés (Tusc. i. 12), I had rather have had you afraid 
of Cerberus (I should have preferred that you feared Cerberus). 
Norz.— Velim ete., in this use, are either potential subjunctives, or apodoses with 
the protasis omitted (§ 447.1.N.). The thing wished may be regarded as a substantive 
clause used as object of the verb of wishing (§ 565. n.1). 
Deliberative Subjunctive 
443. Tho Subjunctive was used in sentences of interrogative form, at first when 
the speaker wished information in regard to the will or desire of the person addressed. 
The mood was therefore hortatory in origin. But such questions when addressed by 
the speaker to himself, as if asking his own advice, become deliberative or, not infre- 
quently, merely exclamatory. In such cases the mood often approaches the meaning 
of the Potential (see § 445). In these uses the subjunctive is often called Deliberative 
or Dubitative. 
444, The Subjunctive is used in questions implying (1) doubt, 
indignation, or (2) an impossibility of the thing’s being done. 
The negative is non. 
quid agam, itdicés? quo mé vertam (Verr. v. 2), what am I to do, judges? 
whither shall I turn? 
etiamne eam saliitem (Pl. Rud. 1275), shall I greet her? 
ii. 40), what are you to do with this man? what fit penalty can you devise 
Sor his wantonness ? 
an ego non venirem (Phil. ii. 3), what, should I not have come? 
quid dicerem (Att. vi. 3. 9), what was I to say? 
quis enim célaverit ignem (Ov. H. xv. 7), who could conceal the flame? 
NorE.— The hortatory origin of some of these questions is obvious. Thus, —quid 
faciamus ?=facidmus [aliquid], quid? let us do—what? (Compare the expanded form 
quid vis facidmus? what do you wish us todo?) Once established, it was readily trans- 
ferred to the past: quid faciam? what am Ito do? quid facerem? what was I to do? 
Questions implying impossibility, however, cannot be distinguished from Apodosis 
(cf. § 517). 
a. In many cases the question has become a mere exclamation, 
rejecting a suggested possibility : 
mihi umquam bondrum praesidium défutirum putarem (Mil. 94), could I 
think that the defence of good men would ever fail me! 
Norr.— The indicative is sometimes used in deliberative questions: as,— quid ago, 
what am I to do?

  282 , SYNTAX: THE VERB [$§ 445-447 
Potential Subjunctive 
445. Of the two principal-uses of the Subjunctive in independent sentences (cf. 
§ 436), the second, or Potential Subjunctive,! is found in a variety of sentence-forms 
having as their common element the fact that the mood represents the action as merely 
conceived or possible, not as desired (hortatory, optative) or real (indicative). Some 
of these uses are very old and may go back to the Indo-European parent speech, but 
no satisfactory connection between the Potential and the Hortatory and Optative 
Subjunctive has been traced. There is no single English equivalent for the Potential 
Subjunctive; the mood must be rendered, according to circumstances, by the auxil- 
iaries would, should, may, might, can, could. 
446. The Potential Subjunctive is used to suggest an action 
as possible or conceivable. The negative is non. 
In this use the Present and the Perfect refer without distinction to 
the immediate future ; the Imperfect (occasionally the Perfect) to past 
time; the Pluperfect (which is rare) to what might have happened. 
447, The Potential Subjunctive has the following uses: — 
1. In cautious or modest assertions in the first person singular of 
expressions of saying, thinking, or wishing (present or perfett) : — 
pace tua dixerim (Mil. 103), I would say by your leave. 
haud sciam an (Lael. 51), I should incline to think. 
tii velim sic existimés (Fam. xii. 6), I should like you to think so. 
certum affirmare non ausim (Liv. iii. 23), I should not dare to assert as sure. 
Norr.— Vellem, néllem, or mallem expressing an unfulfilled wish in present time 
may be classed as independent potential subjunctive or as the apodosis of an unex- 
pressed condition (§ 521): as—vellem adesset M. Antopius (Phil. i. 16), I could wish 
Antony were here. 
2. In the indefinite second person singular of verbs of saying, think- 
ing, and the like (present or imperfect) : — 
crédas non dé puerd scriptum sed 4 puerd (Plin. Ep. iv. 7. 7), you would 
think that it was written not about a boy but by a boy. 
créderés victés (Liv. ii. 43. 9), you would have thought them conquered. 
reds dicerés (id. ii. 85. 5), you would have said they were culprits. 
vidérés susurrds (Hor. S. ii. 8. 77), you might have seen them whispering (lit. 
whispers). 
freté assimilare possis (Ov. M. v. 6), you might compare it to a sea. 
8. With other verbs, in all persons, when some word or phrase in 
the context implies that the action is expressed as merely possible or 
conceivable : — 
1The name Potential Subjunctive is not precisely descriptive, but is fixed in 
grammatical usage.

    §§ 447, 448] IMPERATIVE MOOD 283 
nil ego contulerim iticund6 sinus amicé (Hor. S. i. 5. 44), when in my senses 
I should compare nothing with an interesting friend. 
fortiinam citius reperias quam retineds (Pub. Syr. 168), you may sooner find 
JSortune than keep it. 
aliquis dicat (Ter. And. 640), somebody may say. 
Norr.—In this use the subjunctive may be regarded as the apodosis of an unde- 
veloped protasis. When the conditional idea becomes clearer, it finds expression in 
a formal protasis, and a conditional sentence is developed. 
a. Forsitan, perhaps, regularly takes the Potential Subjunctive 
except in later Latin and in poetry, where the Indicative is also 
common : — 
forsitan quaeratis qui iste terror sit (Rosc. Am. 5), you may perhaps inquire 
what this alarm is. 
forsitan temeré fécerim (id. 81), perhaps I have acted rashly. 
Norr.— The subjunctive clause with forsitan (= fors sit an) was originally an Indi- 
rect Question: it would be a chance whether, ete. 
b. Fortasse, perhaps, is regularly followed by the Indicative; some- 
times, however, by the Subjunctive, but chiefly in later Latin: — 
quaerés fortasse (Fam. xv. 4. 18), perhaps you will ask. 
Norr.— Other expressions for perhaps are (1) forsan (chiefly poetical; construed 
with the indicative or the subjunctive, more commonly the indicative), fors (rare and 
poetical; construed with either the indicative or the subjunctive). Forsit (or fors sit) 
occurs once (Hor. 8. i. 6. 49) and takes the subjunctive. Fortasse is sometimes followed 
by the infinitive with subject accusative in Plautus and Terence. Fortassis (rare; con- 
strued like fortasse) and fortasse an (very rare; construed with the subjunctive) are 
also found. 
IMPERATIVE MOOD 
448. The Imperative is used in Commands and Entreaties : 
consulite vobis, prospicite patriae, cénservate vos (Cat. iv. 8), have a care for 
yourselves, guard the country, preserve yourselves. 
dic, Marce Tulli, sententiam, Marcus Tullius, state your opinion. 
té ipsum concute (Hor. S. i. 3. 35), examine yourself. 
vive, valéque (id. ii. 5. 110), farewell, bless you (live and be well)! 
miserére animi non digna ferentis (Aen. ii. 144), pity a soul bearing undeserved 
misfortune.   
a. The third person of the imperative is antiquated or poetic : — 
ollis salfis populi supréma léx est (Legg. iii. 8), the safety of the people shall 
be their first law. 
ifista imperia suntd, eisque civés modesté parento (id. iii. 6), let there be law- 
ful authorities, and let the citizens strictly obey them. 
Nors.—In prose the Hortatory Subjunctive is commonly used instead (§ 439).

449, The Future Imperative is used in commands, etc., where 
there is a distinct reference to future time : — 
1. In connection with some adverb or other expression that indi- 
cates at what time in the future the action of the imperative shall take 
place. So especially with a future, a future perfect indicative, or 
(in poetry and early Latin) with a present imperative : — 
cras petits, dabitur (Pl. Merc. 769), ask to-morrow [and] it shall be given. 
cum valétidini consulueris, tum cénsulitd navigationi (Fam. xvi. 4. 8), when 
you have attended to your health, then look to your sailing. 
Phyllida mitte mihi, meus est natalis, Iolla; cum faciam vitula pro frigibus,

lands, etc., and have Phyllis for yourself. 
2. In general directions serving for all time, as Precepts, Statutes, 
and Wills : —

of civil right. 
Borea flante, né aratd, semen né iacitd (Plin. H. N. xviii. 334), when the north 
wind blows, plough not nor sow your seed. 
a. The verbs scié, memini, and habeé (in the sense of consider) regu- 
larly use the Future Imperative instead of the Present : — 
filiol6 mé auctum scitd (Att. i. 2), learn that I am blessed with a little boy. 
sic habétd, mi Tird (Fam. xvi. 4. 4), so understand it, my good “Tiro. 
dé palla memento, amabé (Pl. Asin. 939), remember, dear, about the gown. 
bv. The Future Indicative is sometimes used for the imperative ; 
and quin (why not?) with the Present Indicative may have the force 
of a command : — 
si quid acciderit novi, faciés ut sciam (Fam. xiv. 8), you will let me know if 
anything new happens. 
quin accipis (Ter. Haut. 882), here, take it (why not take it). 
c. Instead of the simple Imperative, ciira ut, fac (fac ut), or velim, 
followed by the subjunctive (§ 565), is often used, especially in col- 
loquial language : — 
ciira ut Romae sis (Att. i. 2), take care to be at Rome. 
fac ut valétiidinem ciirés (Fam. xiy. 17), see that you take care of your health. 
domi adsitis facite (Ter. Eun. 506), be at home, do. .

  § 460] PROHIBITION (SEGATIVE COMMAND) 285 
Prohibition (Negative Command) 
450. Prohibition is regularly expressed in classic prose (1) by 
néli with the Infinitive, (2) by cavé with the Present Subjunctive, 
or (8) by né with the Perfect Subjunctive : — 
(1) ndli putdre (Lig. 33), do not suppose (be unwilling to suppose). 
noli impudéns esse (Fam. 30. 1), don’t be shameless. 
ndlite cdgere socids (Verr. ii. 1. 82), do not compel the allies. 
(2) cavé putés (Att. vii. 20), don’t suppose (take care lest you suppose). 
cavé igndscas (Lig. 14), do not pardon. 
cavé festinés (Fam. xvi. 12. 6), do not be in haste. 
(8) né necesse habueris (Att. xvi. 2. 5), do not regard it as necessary. 
né sis admiratus (Fam. vii. 18. 3), do not be surprised. 
hoc facitd; hoc né féceris (Div. ii. 127), thou shalt do this, thou shalt not do that. 
né Apellae quidem dixeris (Fam. vii. 25. 2), do not tell Apella even. 
né yos quidem mortem timueritis (Tusc. i. 98), nor must you fear death.   
   
All three of these constructions are well established in classic prose. The first, 
which is the most ceremonious, occurs oftenest; the third, though not discourteous, is 
usually less formal and more peremptory than the others. 
Norr 1.—Instead of néli the poets sometimes use other imperatives of similar 
meaning (cf. § 457. a): — 
parce pias scelerare maniis (Aen. iii. 42), forbear to defile your pious hands. 
cétera mitte loqui (Hor. Epod. 13. 7), forbear to say the rest. 
fuge quaerere (Hor. Od. i. 9. 13), do not inquire. 
Norn 2.— Cavé né is sometimes used in prohibitions; also vidé né and (colloquially) 
facné:; as,—fac né quid aliud ciirés (Fam. xvi. 11), see that you attend to nothing else. 
Nortr 3.— The present subjunctive with né and the perfect with cavé are found in 
old writers; n€ with the present is common in poetry at all periods: — 
né exspectétis (Pl. Ps. 1234), do not wait. 
né metuas (Mart. Ep. i. 70. 13), do not fear. 
cave quicquam responderis (Pl. Am. 608), do not make any reply. 
Nore 4. — Other negatives sometimes take the place of né:— 
nihil igndveris (Mur. 65), grant no pardon (pardon nothing). 
nec mihi illud dixeris (Fin. i. 25), and do not say this to me. 
Norx 5.— The regular connective, and do not, is néve. 
a. The Present Imperative with né is used in prohibitions by early 
writers and the poets : — 
né timé (Pl. Cure. 520), don’t be afraid. 
nimium né créde colori (Ecl. ii. 17), trust not too much to complexion. 
equo né crédite (Aen. ii. 48), trust not the horse. 
b. The Future Imperative with né is used in prohibitions in laws 
and formal precepts (see § 449. 2). 
1In prohibitions the subjunctive with né is hortatory; that with cavé is an object 
clause (cf. §§ 450. N. 2, 565, N.1).

  286 SYNTAX: THE VERB [§§ 451, 452 
INFINITIVE MOOD 
451. The Infinitive is properly a noun denoting the action of the verb abstractly. 
It differs, however, from other abstract nouns in the following points: (1) it often 
admits the distinction of tense; (2) it is modified by adverbs, not by adjectives; (3) it 
governs the same case as its verb; (4) it is limited to special constructions. 
The Latin Infinitive is the dative or locative case of such a noun! and was origi- 
nally used to denote Purpose; but it has in many constructions developed into a sub- 
stitute for a finite verb. Hence the variety of its use. 
In its use as a verb, the Infinitive may take a Subject Accusative (§ 397. ¢), origi- 
nally the object of another verb on which the Infinitive depended. Thus iubed té valére 
is literally I command you for being well (cf. substantive clauses, § 562. N.). 
Infinitive as Noun 
452. The Infinitive, with or without a subject accusative, may 
be used. with est and similar verbs (1) as the Subject, (2) in Appo- 
sition with the subject, or (3) as a Predicate Nominative? 
1. As Subject : — 
dolére malum est (Fin. v. 84), to suffer pain is an evil. 
bellum est sua vitia ndsse (Att. ii. 17), it’s a fine thing to know one’s own 
Faults. 
praestat componere fluctiis (Aen. i. 135), it is better to calm the waves. 
2. In Apposition with the Subject : — 
proinde quasi initiriam facere id démum esset imperid iti (Sall. Cat. 12), 
just as if this and this alone, to commit injustice, were to use power. 
[Here facere is in apposition with id.] 
8. As Predicate Nominative : — 
id est convenienter natiirae vivere (Fin. iv. 41), that is to live in conformity 
with nature. ([Cf. iti in the last example.] 
Norr 1.— An infinitive may be used as Direct Object in connection with a Predi- 
cate Accusative (§ 393), or as Appositive with such Direct Object: — 
istne ipsum ndn esse cum fueris miserrimum puto (Tusc. i. 12), for I think this 
very thing most wretched, not to be when one has been. [Here istuc ipsum 
belongs to the nown non esse.] 
miserari, invidére, gestire, laetari, haec omnia morbés Graeci appellant (id. iii. 7), 
to feel pity, envy, desire, joy, —all these things the Greeks call diseases. 
(Here the infinitives are in apposition with haec.] 
1 The ending -€ (amare, monére, regere, audire) was apparently locative, the ending -i 
(amari, monéri, regi, audiri) apparently dative; but this difference of case had no signifi- 
eance for Latin syntax. The general Latin restriction of the i-infinitives to the passive 
was not a primitive distinction, but grew up in the course of time. 
2 In these constructions the abstract idea expressed by the infinitive is represented 
as having some quality or belonging to some thing.
-P-A-G-E-299
  §§ 452-454] INFINITIVE AS SUBJECT OF IMPERSONALS 287 
Norte 2.— An Appositive or Predicate noun or adjective used with an infinitive in 
any of these constructions is put in the Accusative, whether the infinitive has a sub- 
ject expressed or not. Thus, —ndn esse cupidum peciinia est (Par. 51), to be free from 
desires (not to be desirous) is money in hand. [No Subject Accusative.] 
a, The infinitive as subject is not common except with est and 
similar verbs. But sometimes, especially in poetry, it is used as the 
subject of verbs which are apparently more active in meaning : — 
quos omnis eadem cupere, eadem ddisse, eadem metuere, in iinum coégit 
(Iug. 31), all of whom the fact of desiring, hating, and fearing the same 
things has united into one. 
ingenuds didicisse fidéliter artis émollit morés (Ov. P. ii. 9. 48), faithfully to 
have learned liberal arts softens the manners. 
posse loqui éripitur (Ov. M. ii. 483), the power of speech is taken away. 
453. Rarely the Infinitive is used exactly like the Accusative 
of a noun: — 
beaté vivere alii in alid, vis in voluptate pdnitis (Fin. ii. 86), a happy life 
different [philosophers] base on different things, you on pleasure. 
quam multa.. . facimus causa amicorum, precari ab indign6, supplicare, etc. 
(Lael. 57), how many things we do for our friends’ sake, ask favors from 
an unworthy person, resort to entreaty, etc. 
nihil exploratum habeas, né amare quidem aut amari (id. 97), you have noth- 
ing assured, not even loving and being loved. 
Norr.— Many complementary and other constructions approach a proper accusa- 
tive use of the infinitive, but their development has been different from that of the 
examples above. Thus,—avaritia . . . superbiam, cridélitatem, deds neglegere, omnia 
yénalia habére Gdocuit (Sall. Cat. 10), avarice taught pride, cruelty, to neglect the gods, 
and to hold everything at a price. 
Infinitive as Apparent Subject of Impersonals 
454. The Infinitive is used as the apparent Subject with many 
impersonal verbs and expressions: 
Such are libet, licet, oportet, decet, placet, visum est, pudet, piget, 
necesse est, opus est, etc. : — 
libet mihi considerare (Quinct. 48), it suits me to consider. 
necesse est mori (Tuse. ii. 2), it is necessary to die. 
quid attinet gloridsé loqui nisi constanter loquare (Fin. ii. 89), what good does 
it do to talk boastfully unless you speak consistently ? 
neque mé vixisse paenitet (id. 84), I do not feel sorry to have lived. 
gubernare mé taedébat (Att. ii. 7. 4), I was tired of being pilot. 
Norr.— This use is a development of the Complementary Infinitive (§ 456); but 
the infinitives approach the subject construction and may be conveniently regarded as 
the subjects of the impersonals.

        288 SYNTAX: THE VERB [§ 455 
455. With impersonal verbs and expressions that take the In- 
finitive as an apparent subject, the personal subject of the action 
may be expressed — 
1. By a Dative, depending on the verb or verbal phrase : — 
rogant ut id sibi facere liceat (B. G. i. 7), they ask that it be allowed them to 
do this. 
non lubet enim mihi déplorare vitam (Cat. M. 84), for it does not please me 
to lament my life. 
visum est mihi dé senectiite aliquid cénscribere ( id. 1), it seemed good to 
me to write something about old age. 
quid est tam secundum natiiram quam senibus émori (id. 71), what is so 
much in accordance with nature as for old men to die? 
exstingui homini sud tempore optabile est (id. 85), for a man to die at the 
appointed time is desirable. 
2. By an Accusative expressed as the subject of the infinitive or 
the object of the impersonal : — 
si licet vivere eum quem Sex. Naevius ndn volt (Quinct. 94), if it is allowed 
a man to live against the will of Sextus Nevius. 
ndnne oportuit praescisse mé ante (Ter. And. 239), ought I not to have known 
beforehand ? 
bratérem irdsci minimé decet (Tusc. iv. 54), it is particularly unbecoming for 
an orator to lose his temper. 
pudéret mé dicere (N. D. i. 109), I should be ashamed to say. 
consilia ineunt quorum eds in vestigid paenitére necesse est (B. G. iv. 5), they 
Form plans for which they must at once be sorry. 
Norx.— Libet, placet, and visum est take the dative only; oportet, pudet, piget, and 
generally decet, the accusative only; licet and necesse est take either case. 
a. A predicate noun or adjective is commonly in the Accusative ; 
but with licet regularly, and with other verbs occasionally, the Dative 
is used : — 
expedit bonds esse vobis (Ter. Haut. 388), it is for your advantage to be good. 
licuit esse 6tids6 Themistocli (Tuse. i. 33), Themistocles might have been inac- 
tive (it was allowed to Themistocles to be inactive). 
mihi neglegenti esse ndn licet (Att. i. 17. 6), I must not be negligent. [But 
also neglegentem. ] 
cir his esse liberés nén licet (Flace. 71), why is it not allowed these men to 
be free? 3 
non est omnibus stantibus necesse dicere (Marc. 38), it is not necessary for 
all to speak standing. 
Not. — When the subject is not expressed, as being indefinite (one, anybody), a 
predicate noun or adjective is regularly in the accusative (ef. § 452. 3, N.2): as,— 
vel pace vel bello clarum fieri licet (Sall. Cat. 3), one can become illustrious either in 
peace or in war.

  §§ 456, 457] COMPLEMENTARY INFINITIVE 289 
Complementary Infinitive 
456. Verbs which imply another action of the same subject to 
complete their meaning take the Infinitive without a subject 
BCCUSALYy Or =e etree OS Ur see en an oa 
Such are verbs denoting to be able, dare, undertake, remember, for- 
get, be accustomed, begin, continue, cease, hesitate, learn, know how, 
fear, and the like : — 
hic ques dicere (Cat. M. 82), this I can say. 
mittd quaerere (Rose. Am. 53), I omit to ask. 
vereor laudare praesentem (N. D. i. 58), I fear to praise a man to his face. 
6rd ut matiirés venire (Att. iv. 1), I beg you will make haste to come. 
oblivisci ndn possum quae vold (Fin. ii. 104), I cannot forget that which I 
wish. 
désine id mé docére (Tusc. ii. 29), cease to teach me that. 
dicere solébat, he used to say. 
auded dicere, I venture to say. 
loqui posse coepi, I began to be able to speak. 
Nore. — The peculiarity of the Complementary Infinitive construction is that no 
Subject Accusative is in general admissible or conceivable. But some infinitives 
usually regarded as objects can hardly be distinguished from this construction when 
they have no subject expressed. Thus vold dicere and volé mé dicere mean the same 
thing, I wish to speak, but the latter is object-infinitive, while the former is not 
apparently different in origin and construction from que6 dicere (complementary infin- 
itive), and again vold eum dicere, I wish him to speak, is essentially different from 
either (cf. § 563. 0). 
457. Many verbs take either a Subjunctive Clause or a Com- 
plementary Infinitive, without difference of meaning. 
Such are verbs signifying willingness, necessity, propriety, resolve, 
command, prohibition, effort, and the like (cf. § 563) : — 
décernere optabat (Q. C. iii. 11. 1), he was eager to decide. 
optavit ut tollerétur (Off. iii. 94), he was eager to be taken up. 
oppiignare contendit (B. G. v. 21), he strove to take by storm. 
contendit ut caperet (id. v. 8), he strove to take. 
bellum gerere cOnstituit (id. iv. 6), he decided to carry on war. 
constitueram ut manérem (Att. xvi. 10. 1), I had decided to remain. 
* Norr 1.— For the infinitive with subject accusative used with some of these verbs 
instead of a complementary infinitive, see § 563. 
Nore 2.— Some verbs of these classes never take the subjunctive, but are identi- 
cal in meaning with others which do: — 
eds qués titari débent déserunt (Off. i. 28), they forsake those whom they ought to 
protect. 
aveo pignare (Att. ii. 18. 3), I’m anxious to fight.

  290 SYNTAX: THE VERB [§§ 457-460 
a. In poetry and later writers many verbs may have the infini- 
tive, after the analogy of verbs of more literal meaning that take 
it in prose : — 
furit té reperire (Hor. Od. i. 15. 27), he rages to find thee. [A forcible way 
of saying cupit (§§ 457, 563. b).] 
saevit exstinguere nomen (Ov. M. i. 200), he rages to blot out the name. 
fuge quaerere (Hor. Od. i. 9. 18), forbear to ask (cf. § 450. n.1). 
parce pias scelerare maniis (Aen. iii. 42), forbear to defile your pious hands. 
458. A Predicate Noun or Adjective after a complementary 
infinitive takes the case of the subject of the main verb: — 
fierique studébam 6éius priidentia doctior (Lael. 1), I was eager to become 
more wise through his wisdom. 
scid quam soleas esse occupatus (Fam. xvi. 21. 7), I know how busy you 
usually are (are wont to be). 
brevis esse lab6r6, obsciirus fid (Hor. A. P. 25), I struggle to be brief, I become 
obscure. 
Infinitive with Subject Accusative 
459. The Infinitive with Subject Accusative is used with verbs 
and other expressions of knowing, thinking, telling, and perceiving 
(Indirect Discourse, § 579) : — 
*  dicit montem ab hostibus tenéri (B. G. i. 22), he says that the hill is held by 
the enemy. [Direct: mons ab hostibus tenétur.] 
Infinitive of Purpose 
of Purpose. 
a. The infinitive is used ihdsolated passages instead of a subjunc- 
tive clause after habed, dé, oe — 
tantum habed pollicéri (Fam. i. 5a. 3), so much I have to promise. [Here 
the more formal construction would be quod pollicear. ] 
ut Iovi bibere ministraret (Tusc. i. 65), to serve Jove with wine (to drink). 
meridié bibere datd (Cato R. R. 89), give (to) drink at noonday. 460. In a few cases the a retains its original meaning 
b. Paratus, suétus, and their compounds, and a few other partici- 
ples (used as adjectives), take the infinitive like the verbs from which 
they come : — 
id quod parati sunt facere (Quint. 8), that which they are ready to do. 
adsuéfacti superari (B. G. vi. 24), used to being conquered. 
currii succédere suéti (Aen. iii. 541), used to being harnessed to the chariot. 
copias bellare consuétas (B. Afr. 78), forces accustomed to fighting. 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  §§ 460, 461] PECULIAR INFINITIVES 291 
Nors.—In prose these words more commonly take the Gerund or Gerundive con- 
struction (§ 503 ff.) either in the genitive, the dative, or the accusative with ad:— 
insuétus navigandi (B. G. v. 6), unused to making voyages. 
alendis liberis suéti (Tac. Ann. xiv. 27), accustomed to supporting children. 
corpora insuéta ad onera portanda (B. C. i. 78), bodies unused to carry burdens. 
c. The poets and early writers often use the infinitive to express 
purpose when there is no analogy with any prose construction : — 
filius intré iit vidére quid agat (Ter. Hec. 345), your son has gone in to see what 
fe is doing. [In prose: the supine visum.] 
non ferrd Libycés populare Penatis venimus (Aen. i. 527), we have not come 
to lay waste with the sword the Libyan homes. 
Joricam donat habére vird (id. v. 262), he gives the hero a breastplate to wear. 
[In prose: habendam. ] 
Norr.—So rarely in prose writers of the classic period. 5 
For the Infinitive used instead of a Substantive Clause of Purpose, see § 457. 
For tempus est abire, see § 504. n. 2. 
Peculiar Infinitives 
461. Many Adjectives take the Infinitive in poetry, following a 
Greek idiom : — 
diirus compénere versiis (Hor. S. i. 4. 8), harsh in composing verse. 
cantari dignus (Hcl. v. 54), worthy to be sung. [In prose: qui cantétur.] 
fortis tractare serpentis (Hor. Od. i. 37. 26), brave to handle serpents. 
cantare periti (Ecl. x. 32), skilled in song. 
facilés aurem praebére (Prop. iii. 14. 15), ready to lend an ear. 
nescia vinci pectora (Aen. xii. 527), hearts not .knowing how to yield. 
té vidére aegroti (Plaut. Trin. 75), sick of seeing you. 
a. Rarely in poetry the infinitive is used to express result : — 
fingit equum docilem magister ire viath qua monstret eques (Hor. Ep. i. 2. 64), 
the trainer makes the horse gentle so as to go in the road the rider points 
out. 
hic levare . . . pauperem laboribus vocatus audit (Hor. Od. ii. 18. 38), he, 
when called, hears, so as to relieve the poor man of his troubles. 
Nore. — These poetic constructions were originally regular and belong to the Infin- 
itive as a noun in the Dative or Locative case (§ 451). They had been supplanted, 
however, by other more formal constructions, and were afterwards restored in part 
through Greek influence. 
b. The infinitive occasionally occurs as a pure noun limited by a 
demonstrative, a possessive, or some other adjective : — 
h6c non dolére (Fin. ii. 18), this freedom from pain. [Cf. tdtum hic beaté 
vivere (Tuse. v. 38), this whole matter of the happy life.] 
nostrum vivere (Pers. i. 9), our life (to live). 
scire tuum (id. i. 27), your knowledge (to know).

  292 SYNTAX: THE VERB [S§ 462, 463 
Exclamatory Infinitive 
462. The Infinitive, with Subject Accusative,! may be used in 
Exclamations (cf. § 897. d) : — 
té in tantés aerumnas propter mé incidisse (Fam. xiv. 1), alas, that you 
should have fallen into such grief for me! 
méne inceptd désistere victam (Aen. i. 37), what! I beaten desist from my 
purpose? 
Nore 1.— The interrogative particle -ne is often attached to the emphatic word (as 
in the second example). 
NortE 2.— The Present and the Perfect Infinitive are used in this construction with 
their ordinary distinction of time (§ 486). 
a. A subjunctive clause, with or without ut, is often used ellip- 
tically in exclamatory questions. The question may be introduced 
by the interrogative -ne : — 
quamquam quid loquor? té ut illa rés frangat (Cat. i. 22), yet why do I 
speak? [the idea] that anything should bend you! 
egone ut té interpellem (Tusc. ii. 42), what, I interrupt you ? 
ego tibi irascerer (Q. Fr. i. 3), I angry with you? 
Nors.—The Infinitive in exclamations usually refers to something actually oc- 
curring; the Subjunctive, to something contemplated. 
Historical Infinitive 
463. The Infinitive is often used for the Imperfeet Indicative 
in narration, and takes a subject in the Nominative: 
tum Catilina pollicéri novas tabulas (Sall. Cat. 21), then’ Catiline promised 
abolition of debts (clean ledgers). 
ego instare ut mihi respondéret (Verr. ii. 188), I kept urging him to answer me. 
pars cédere, alii insequi; neque signa neque drdinés observare ; ubi quemque 
periculum céperat, ibi resistere ac propulsare; arma, téla, equi, viri, 
hostés atque civés permixti; nihil cdnsilid neque imperid agi; fors 
omnia regere (Iug. 51), a part give way, others press on ; they hold neither 
to standards nor ranks; where danger overtook them, there each would 
stand and fight; arms, weapons, horses, men, foe and friend, mingled 
in confusion ; nothing went by counsel or command ; chance ruled all.   
Nor. — This construction is not strictly historical, but rather descriptive, and is 
never used to state a mere historical fact. It is rarely found in subordinate clauses. 
Though occurring in most of the writers of all periods, it is most frequent in the his- 
torians Sallust, Livy, Tacitus. It does not occur in Suetonius. 
1 This construction is elliptical ; that is, the thought is quoted in Indirect Discourse, 
though no verb of saying etc. is expressed or even, perhaps, implied (compare the 
French dire que). Passages like hancine ego ad rem natam miseram mé memorabo? 
(Plaut. Rud. 188) point to the origin of the construction.
-P-A-G-E-305
  §§ 464, 465] TENSES OF THE INDICATIVE 298 
TENSES 
464, The number of possible Tenses is very great. For in each of the three times, 
Present, Past, and Future, an action may be represented as going on, completed, or 
beginning; as habitual or isolated; as defined in time or indejinite (aoristic) ; as 
determined with reference to the time of the speaker, or as not itself so determined 
but as relative to some time which is determined; and the past and future times may 
be near or remote. Thus a scheme of thirty or more tenses might be devised. 
But, in the development of forms, which always takes place gradually, no language 
finds occasion for more than a small part of these. The most obvious distinctions, 
according to our habits of thought, appear in the following scheme: — 
1. Definite (fixing the time of the action) 2. Indefinite 
INCOMPLETE COMPLETE NARRATIVE 
Present: a. I am writing. d. I have written. g. Twrite. 
Past: b. Iwas writing. e. [had written. h. I wrote. 
Future: ¢. I shail be writing. f. I shall havé written. i. I shall write. 
Most languages disregard some of these distinctions, and some make other distine- 
tions not here given. The Indo-European parent speech had a Present tense to express 
aand g, a Perfect to express d, an Aorist to express h, a Future to express ¢ and i, and 
an Imperfect to express b. The Latin, however, confounded the Perfect and Aorist 
in asingle form (the Perfect scripsi), thus losing all distinction of form between d and 
h, and probably in a great degree the distinction of meaning. The nature of this con- 
fusion may be seen by comparing dixi, dicdvi, and didici (all Perfects derived from the 
same root, Dic), with @aéa, Skr. adiksham, dédexa, Skr. didega. Latin also devel- 
oped two new forms, those for e (scripseram) and / (scripserd), and thus possessed six 
tenses, as seen in § 154. c. 
The lines between these six tenses in Latin are not hard and fast, nor are they pre- 
cisely the same that we drawin English. Thus in many verbs the form corresponding 
to I have written (d) is used for those corresponding to I am writing (a) and I write (g) 
in a slightly different sense, and the form corresponding to I had written (e) is used in 
like manner for that corresponding to Iwas writing (b). Again, the Latin often uses 
the form for I shall have written (f) instead of that for I shall write (). Thus, novi, I 
have learned, is used for I know; constiterat, he had taken his position, for he stood; 
cdgnoverd, I shall have learned, for I shall be aware. In general a writer may take his 
own point of view.

taking place or existing, and so (2) as incomplete in present time, 
or (8) as indefinite, referring to no particular time, but denoting a 
general truth : —

sendtus haec intellegit, consul videt, hic tamen vivit (Cat. i. 2), the senate 
knows this, the consut sees it, yet this man lives. 
tibi concédd meds sédis (Div. i. 104), I give you my seat (an offer which may 
or may not be accepted). 
exspectd quid velis (Ter. And. 34), I await your pleasure (what you wish). 
tii Actionem instituis, ille aciem instruit (Mur. 22), you arrange a case, he 
arrays an army. [The present is here used of regular employment. ] 
minora di neglegunt (N. D. iii. 86), the gods disregard trifles. [General 
truth.] 
obsequium amicos, véritas odium parit (Ter. And. 68), flattery gains friends, 
truth hatred. [General truth. ] 
Nors.—The present of a general truth is sometimes called the Gnomic Present. 
a. The present is regularly used in quoting writers whose works 
are extant : — 
Epiciirus véro ea dicit (Tusc. ii. 17), but Epicurus says such things. 
apud illum Ulixés lamentatur in volnere (id. ii. 49), in him (Sophocles) 
Ulysses laments over his wound. 
Polyphémum Homérus cum ariete colloquentem facit (id. v. 115), Homer 
brings in (makes) Polyphemus talking with his ram. 
Present with tam diz etc. 
466. The Present with expressions of duration of time (espe- 
cially iam difi, iam diidum) denotes an action continuing in the pres- 
ent, but begun in the past (cf. § 471. 0). 
In this use the present is commonly to be rendered by the perfect 
in English : — 
iam dit ignérd quid agds (Fam. vii. 9), for a long time I have not known what 
you were doing. 
té iam diidum hortor (Cat. i. 12), I have long been urging you. 
patimur multds iam annds (Verr. v. 126), we suffer now these many years. 
[The Latin perfect would imply that we no longer suffer.] 
anni sunt octd cum ista causa versatur (cf. Clu. 82), it is now eight years 
that this case has been in hand. 
annum iam audis Cratippum (Off. i. 1), for a year you have been a hearer of 
Cratippus. 
adhiic Plancius mé retinet (Fam. xiv. 1. 3), so far Plancius has kept me here. 
Nore 1.— The difference in the two idioms is that the English states the beginning 
and leaves the continuance to be inferred, while the Latin states the continuance and 
leaves the beginning to be inferred. Compare he has long suffered (and still suffers) 
with he still suffers (and has suffered long). 
Note 2.—Similarly the Present Imperative with iam diidum indicates that the 
action commanded ought to have been done or was wished for long ago (cf. the Per- 
fect Imperative in Greek): as,—iam diidum simite poenids (Aen. ii. 103), exact the 
penalty long delayed.
-P-A-G-E-307
  §§ 467-469] PRESENT TENSE 295 
Conative Present 
467. The Present sometimes denotes an action attempted or 
begun in present time, but never completed at all (Conative Pres- 
ent, cf. § 471. ce): — 
iam iamque manii tenet (Aen. ii. 530), and now, even now, he attempts to 
grasp him. 
dénsos fertur in hostis (id. ii. 511), he starts to rush into the thickest of the foe. 
décernd quinquaginta diérum supplicationés (Phil. xiv. 29), I move for fifty 
days’ thanksgiving. [Cf. senatus décrévit, the senate ordained. ] 
Present for Future 
468. The Present, especially in colloquial language and poetry, 
- is often used for the Future: — 
imusne sessum (De Or. iii. 17), shall we take a seat? (are we going to sit ?) 
hodié uxdrem diicis (Ter. And. 321), are you to be married to-day ? 
quod si fit, pered funditus (id. 244), if this happens, I am utterly undone. 
ecquid mé adiuvas (Clu. 71), won’t you give me a little help ? 
in itis vocd té. ndn ed. ndn is (Pl. Asin. 480), I summon you to the court. 
Iwonwt go. You won't? 
Norr,—Eé and its compounds are especially frequent in this use (cf. where are 
you going to-morrow? and the Greek ej in a future sense). Verbs of necessity, 
possibility, wish, and the like (as possum, vol, etc.) also have reference to the future. 
| For other uses of the Present in a future sense, see under Conditions (§ 516. a. N.), 
antequam and priusquam (§ 551. c), dum (§ 553, N.2), and § 444. a. N. 
Historical Present 
469. The Present in lively narrative is often used for the His- 
torical Perfect : — 
affertur nintius Syraciisis; curritur ad praetdrium; Cleomenés in pitiblicd 
esse ndn audet; incliidit sé domi (Verr. v. 92), the news is brought to Syra- 
cuse ; they run to headquarters ; Oleomenes does not venture to be abroad ; _ 
he shuts himself up at home. 
Norsr.— This usage, common in all languages, comes from imagining past events 
as going on before our eyes (repraesentatid, § 585. b. N.). 
For the Present Indicative with dum, while, see § 556. 
a. The present may be used for the perfect in a summary enumera- 
tion of past events (Annalistic Present) : — 
Rodma interim créscit Albae ruinis: duplicdtur civium numerus; Caelius 
additur urbi mons (Liv. i. 80), Rome meanwhile grows as a result of the 
fall of Alba: the number of citizens is doubled; the Colian hill is added 
to the town.
-P-A-G-E-308
  296 SYNTAX: THE VERB [§§ 470, 471 
IMPERFECT TENSE 
470. The Imperfect denotes an action or a state as continued 
or repeated in past time: — 
hune audiébant anted (Manil. 18), they used to hear of him before. 
[Sdcratés] ita cénsébat itaque disseruit (Tusc. i. 72), Socrates thought so (habit- 
ually), and so he spoke (then). 
priidéns esse putabatur (Lael. 6), he was (generally) thought wise. [The per- 
fect would refer to some particular case, and not to a state of things. ] 
jamque rubéscébat Auréra (Aen. iii. 521), and now the dawn was blushing. 
ara vetus stabat (Ov. M. vi. 826), an old altar stood there. 
Nore. — The Imperfect is a descriptive tense and denotes an action conceived as 
in progress or a state of things as actually observed. Hence in many verbs it does 
not differ in meaning from the Perfect. Thus réx erat and réx fuit may often be used 
indifferently ; but the former describes the condition while the latter only states it. _ 
The English is less exact in distinguishing these two modes of statement. Hence the 
Latin Imperfect is often translated by the English Preterite : — 
Haedui graviter ferébant, neque légatds ad Caesarem mittere audébant (B. G. v. 
6), the Hedui were displeased, and did not dare to send envoys to Cesar. 
[Here the Imperfects describe the state of things.] But, — 
id tulit factum graviter Indiitiomarus (id. v. 4), Indutiomarus was displeased at 
this action. [Here the Perfect merely states the fact.] 
aedificia vicdsque habébant (id. iv. 4), they had buildings and villages. 
471. The Imperfect represents a present tense transferred to 
past time. Hence all the meanings which the Present has derived 
from the continuance of the action belong also to the Imperfect in 
reference to past time. 
a. The Imperfect is used in descriptions : — 
erant omnin6 itinera duo... méns altissimus impendébat (B. G. i. 6), there 
were in all two ways... a very high mountain overhung. 
‘b. With iam dif, iam diidum, and other expressions of duration of 
time, the Imperfect denotes an action continuing in the past but be- 
gun at some previous time (cf. § 466). 
In this construction the Imperfect is rendered by the English Plu- 
perfect : — 
iam didum flébam (Ov. M. iii. 656), I had been weeping for a long time. 
cdpids quis didi comparabant (Fam. xi. 13. 5), the forces which they had long 
been getting ready. 
c. The Imperfect sometimes denotes an action as begun (Inceptive 
Imperfect), or as ae or only intended (Conative Imperfect ; cf. 
§ 467) :—
-P-A-G-E-309
  § 471] IMPERFECT TENSE 297 
in exsilium @iciébam quem iam ingressum esse in bellum vidébam (Cat. ii. 
14), was I trying to send into exile one who I saw had already gone 
2 into war? 
hunc igitur diem sibi prop6néns Mil6, cruentis manibus ad illa augusta cen- 
turidérum auspicia veniébat (Mil. 43), was Milo coming (i.e. was it likely 
that he would come), etc.? 
si licitum esset veniébant (Verr. v. 129), they were coming if it had been allowed 
(they were on the point of coming, and would have done so if, ete.). 
Note. —To this head may be referred the imperfect with iam, denoting the begin- 
ning of an action or state: as, —iamque arva tenébant ultima (Aen. vi. 477), and now 
they were just getting to the farthest fields. 
d. The Imperfect is sometimes used to express a surprise at the 
present discovery of a fact already existing : — 
6 ti quoque aderas (Ter. Ph. 858), oh, you are here too! 
ehem, tiin hic eras, mi Phaedria (Ter. Eun. 86), what! you here, Phedria? 
& miser! quanta labdrabas Charybdi (Hor. Od. i. 27. 19), unhappy boy, what 
a whirlpool you are struggling in [and I never knew it]! 
e. The Imperfect is often used in dialogue by the comic poets 
where later writers would employ the Perfect : — 
ad amicum Calliclem quoi rem aibat mandasse hic suam (Pl. Trin. 956), to 
his friend Callicles, to whom, he said, he had intrusted his property. 
praesagibat mi animus fristra mé ire quom exibam dom6 (Pl. Aul. 178), my 
mind mistrusted when I went from home that I went in vain. 
Nors. — So, in conversation the imperfect of verbs of saying (cf. as I was a-saying) 
is common in classic prose : — 
at medici quoque, ita enim dic&bas, saepe falluntur (N. D. iii. 15), but physicians 
also, —for that is what you were saying just now, —are often mistaken. 
haec mihi feré in mentem veniébant (id. ii. 67, 168), this is about what occurred 
to me, etc. [In a straightforward narration this would be vénérunt.] 
f. The Imperfect with negative words often has the force of the 
English auxiliary could or would : — 
itaque (Damoclés) nee pulchrés illds ministratorés aspiciébat (Tusc. v. 62), 
therefore he could not look upon those beautiful slaves. [In this case did 
not would not express the idea of continued prevention of enjoyment by 
the overhanging sword. ] 
nec enim dum eram vobiscum animum meum vidébatis (Cat. M. 79), for, you 
know, while I was with you, you could not see my soul. [Here the Per- 
fect would refer only to one moment. ] 
Lentulus satis erat fortis ratér, sed cdgitandi non ferébat laborem (Brut. 268), 
Lentulus was bold enough as an orator, but could not endure the exertion 
of thinking hard.

FUTURE TENSE 
472. The Future denotes an action or state that will occur 
hereafter. 
a. The Future may have the force of an Imperative (§ 449. 0). 
b. The Future is often required in a subordinate clause in Latin 
where in English futurity is sufficiently expressed by the main clause: 
cum aderit vidébit, when he is there he will see (cf. § 547). 
sanabimur si volémus (Tusc. iii. 18), we shall be healed if we wish (cf. § 516. a). 
Nore. — But the Present is common in future protases (§ 516. a. N.). 
CoMPLETED ACTION 
PERFECT TENSE 
Perfect Definite and Historical Perfect 
473. The Perfect denotes an action either as now completed 
(Perfect Definite), or as having taken place at some undefined point 
of past time (Historical or Aoristic Perfect). 
The Perfect Definite corresponds in general to the English Perfect 
with have; the Historical Perfect to the English Preterite (or Past): 
(1) ut ego féci, qui Graecas litteras senex didici (Cat. M. 26), as I have done, 
who have learned Greek in my old age. 
dititurni silenti finem hodiernus diés attulit (Mare. 1), this day has put an 
end to my long-continued silence. 
(2) tantum bellum extréma hieme apparavit, ineunte vére suscépit, media 
aestate confécit (Manil. 35), so great a war he made ready for at the end 
of winter, undertook in early spring, and jinished by midsummer. 
Notr.—The distinction between these two uses is represented by two forms in 
most other Indo-European languages, but was almost if not wholly lost to the minds 
of the Romans. It must be noticed, however, on account of the marked distinction 
in English and also because of certain differences in the sequence of tenses. 
a. The Indefinite Present, denoting a customary action or a general 
truth (§ 465), often has the Perfect in a subordinate clause referring 
to time antecedent to that of the main clause : — 
qui in compedibus corporis semper fuérunt, etiam cum soliti sunt tardius 
ingrediuntur (Tusc. i. 75), they who have always been in the fetters of the 
body, even when released move more slowly. 
simul ac mihi collibitum est, praest6 est imigd (N. D. i. 108), as soon as I 
have taken a fancy, the image is before my eyes. 
 
-P-A-G-E-311
  §§ 473-476] PERFECT TENSE 299 
haec morte effugiuntur, etiam si n6n événérunt, tamen quia possunt évenire 
(Tuse. i. 86), these things are escaped by death even if they have not [yet] 
happened, because they still may happen. 
Nore. — This use of the perfect is especially common in the protasis of General 
Conditions in present time (§ 518. 0). 
474. The Perfect is sometimes used emphatically to denote that 
a thing or condition of things that once existed no longer exists : 
fuit ista quondam in hae ré piiblica virtiis (Cat. i. 3), there was once such vir- 
tue in this commonwealth. 
habuit, ndn habet (Tuse. i. 87), he had, he has no longer. 
filium habed . . . immo habui; nunc habeam necne incertumst (Ter. Haut. 
93), I have a son, no, I had one ; whether I have now or not is uncertain. 
fuimus Troes, fuit Ilium (Aen. ii. 825), we have ceased to be Trojans, Troy is 
no more. 
Special Uses of the Perfect 
475. The Perfect is sometimes used of a general truth, espe- 
cially with negatives (Gnomie Perfect) : 
qui studet contingere métam multa tulit fécitque (Hor. A. P. 412), he who 
aims to reach the goal, first bears and does many things. 
non aeris acervus et auri dédixit corpore febris (id. Ep. i. 2. 47), the pile of 
brass and gold removes not fever from the frame. 
Norr.—The gnomic perfect strictly refers to past time; but its use implies that 
something which never did happen in any known case never does happen, and never 
will (cf. the English ‘ Faint heart never won fair lady’’); or, without a negative, 
that what has once happened will always happen under similar circumstances.   
a. The Perfect is often used in expressions containing or implying 
a negation, where in affirmation the Imperfect would be preferred : — 
dicébat melius quam scripsit Horténsius (Or. 182), Hortensius spoke better 
than he wrote. [Here the negative is implied in the comparison: com- 
pare the use of quisquam, illus, etc. (§§ 3u, 312), and the French ne 
after comparatives and superlatives. ] 
476. The completed tenses of some verbs are equivalent to the 
incomplete tenses of verbs of kindred meaning. 
Such are the preteritive verbs 6di, I hate ; memini, Iremember ; novi, 
I know ; cdnsuévi, I am accustomed,’ with others used preteritively, 
as vénerat (= aderat, he was at hand, etc.), cénstitérunt, they stand firm 
(have taken their stand), and many inceptives (see § 263. 1): — 
1 Cf, détestor, reminiscor, scid, soled.

  300 SYNTAX: THE VERB [s§ 476-478 
qui diés aestiis maximds efficere cinsuévit (B. G. iv. 29), which day generally 
makes the highest tides (is accustomed to make). 
efiius splendor obsolévit (Quinct. 59), whose splendor is now all faded. 
Nore.— Many other verbs are occasionally so used: as, —dum oculds certamen 
averterat (Liv. xxxii. 24), while the contest had turned their eyes (kept them turned). - 
[Here Averterat = tentbat.] 
PLUPERFECT TENSE 
477, The Pluperfect is used (1) to denote an action or state 
completed in past time; or (2) sometimes to denote an action in 
indefinite time, but prior to some past time referred to: — 
(1) loci natiira erat haec, quem locum nostri castris délégerant (B. G. ii. 18), 
this was the nature of the ground which our men had chosen for a camp. 
Viridovix summam imperi tenébat edrum omnium civitatum quae déféce- 
rant (id. iii. 17), Viridovia held the chief command of all those tribes which 
had revolied. 
(2) neque vérd cum aliquid mandaverat confectum putabat (Cat. iii. 16), but 
when he had given a thing in charge he did not look on it as done. 
quae si quand6 adepta est id quod ei fuerat concupitum, tum fert alacritatem 
(Tusc. iv. 15), if it (desire) ever has gained what it had [previously] 
desired, then it produces joy. 
For the Epistolary Pluperfect, see § 479. 
FUTURE PERFECT TENSE 
478. The Future Perfect denotes an action as completed in the 
future : — 
ut sémentem féceris, ita metés (De Or. ii. 261), as you sow (shall have sown), 
80 shall you reap. 
carmina tum melius, cum vénerit ipse, canémus (Ecl. ix. 67), then shall we 
sing our songs better, when he himself has come (shall have come). 
si illus insidiae claridrés hac lice fuerint, tum dénique obsecrabé (Mil. 6), 
when the plots of that man have been shown to be as clear as daylight, 
then, and not till then, shall I conjure you. 
ego certé meum officium praestiterd (B. G. iv. 25), I at least shall have done 
my duty (i.e. when the time comes to reckon up the matter, I shall be 
found to have done it, whatever the event). 
Nors.—Latin is far more exact than English in distinguishing between mere 
future action and action completed in the future. Hence the Future Perfect is much 
commoner in Latin than in English. It may even be used instead of the Future, from 
the fondness of the Romans for representing an action as completed : — 
quid inyentum sit pauld post viderd (Acad. ii. 76), what has been found out I shall 
see presently. 
qui Antdnium oppresserit bellum taeterrimum cénfécerit (Fam. x. 19), whoever 
crushes (shall have crushed) Antony will jinish (will have finished) a most 
loathsome war.

§§ 479-481] TENSES OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE 301 
EPISTOLARY TENSES 
479, In Letters, the Perfect Historical or the Imperfect may 
be used for the present, and the Pluperfect for any past tense, as 
if the letter were dated at the time it is supposed to be received : — 
neque tamen, haec cum scribébam, eram nescius quantis oneribus premerére 
(Fam. v. 12. 2), nor while I write this am I ignorant under what burdens 
you are weighed down. 
ad tuds omnis [epistulds] rescripseram pridié (Att. ix. 10. 1), I answered all 
your letters yesterday. 
cum quod scriberem ad té nihil habérem, tamen has dedi litteras (Att. ix. 16), 
though I have nothing to write to you, still I write this letter. 
Nor. — In this use these tenses are called the Epistolary Perfect, Imperfect, and 
Pluperfect. The epistolary tenses are not employed with any uniformity, but only 
when attention is particularly directed to the time of writing (so especially scribébam, 
dabam, etc.). 
TENSES OF THE SUBJUNCTIVE 
480. The tenses of the Subjunctive in Independent Clauses de- 
note time in relation to the time of the speaker. 
The Present always refers to future (or indefinite) time, the Im- 
perfect to either past or present, the Perfect to either future or 
past, the Pluperfect always to past. 
481. The tenses of the Subjunctive in Dependent Clauses were 
habitually used in certain fixed connections with the tenses of the 
main verb. 
These connections were determined by the time of the main 
verb and the time of the dependent verb together. They are 
known, collectively, as the Sequence of Tenses. 
Nor. —The so-called Sequence of Tenses is not a mechanical law. Each tense 
of the subjunctive in dependent clauses (as in independent) originally denoted its 
own time in relation to the time of the speaker, though less definitely than the corre- 
sponding tenses of the indicative. Gradually, however, as the complex sentence was 
more strongly felt as a unit, certain types in which the tenses of the dependent 
clause seemed to accord with those of the main clause were almost unconsciously 
regarded as regular, and others, in which there was no such agreement, as excep- 
tional. Thus a pretty definite system of correspondences grew up, which is codi- 
fied in the rules for the Sequence of Tenses. These, however, are by no means 
rigid. They do not apply with equal stringency to all dependent constructions, and 
they were frequently disregarded, not only when their strict observance would have 
obscured the sense, but for the sake of emphasis and variety, or merely from care- 
lessness.

Sequence of Tenses 
482. The tenses of the Subjunctive in Dependent Clauses fol- 
low special rules for the Sequence of Tenses. 
With reference to these rules all tenses when used in independ- 
ent clauses are divided into two classes,— Primary and Secondary. 
1. Primary. — The Primary Tenses include all forms that express 
present or future time. These are the Present, Future, and Future 
Perfect Indicative, the Present and Perfect Subjunctive, and the 
Present and Future Imperative. 
2. Seconpary. — The Secondary Tenses include all forms that re- 
fer to past time. These are the Imperfect, Perfect, and Pluperfect 
Indicative, the Imperfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive, and the His- 
torical Infinitive. 
Norer.— To these may be added certain forms less commonly used in independent 
clauses: —(1) Primary: Present Infinitive in Exclamations; (2) Secondary: Perfect 
Infinitive in Exclamations (see §§ 462, 485. a. N.). 
The Perfect Definite is sometimes treated as primary (see § 485. a). 
For the Historical Present, see § 485. ¢; for the Imperfect Subjunctive in Apodosis, 
see § 485. h.. 
483. The following is the general rule for the Sequence of 
Tenses : —1 
In complex sentences a Primary tense in the main clause is 
followed by the Present or Perfect in the dependent clause, and 
a Secondary tense by the Imperfect or Pluperfect : — 
Primary TENSES 
rogo, TI ask, am asking quid facias, what you are doing. 
rogabé, I shall ask quid féceris, what you did, were doing, 
togavi (sometimes), I have asked have done, have been doing. 
rogaverd, I shall have asked quid factiirus sis, what you will do. 
scribit, he writes | t nd: re 
Scribet, he will write J isaac ede ara te iage 
scribe (scribitd), write ut nds moneds, to warn us. 
scribit, he writes quasi oblitus sit, as if he had forgotten. 
1 The term is sometimes extended to certain relations between the tenses of sub- 
ordinate verbs in the indicative and those of the main verb. These relations do not 
differ in principle from those which we are considering ; but for convenience the term 
Sequence of Tenses is in this book restricted to subjunctives, in accordance with the 
usual practice. :
-P-A-G-E-315
  §§ 483-485] SEQUENCE OF TENSES 803 
Srconpary TEysEs 
rogabam, I asked, was asking | quid facerés, what you were doing. 
ae e : quid fécissés, what you had done, had rogavi, I asked, have asked been doing. 
togaveram, Thad asked J quid factiirus essés, what you would do. 
scripsit, he wrote ut nds monéret, to warn us. 
scripsit, he wrote quasi oblitus esset, as if he had forgotten. 
484. In applying the rule for the Sequence of Tenses, observe — 
(1) Whether the main verb is («) primary or (0) secondary. 
(2) Whether the dependent verb is to denote completed action(ie. 
past with reference to the main verb) or incomplete action (i.e. pres- 
ent or future with reference to the main verb). Then — 
a. If the leading verb is primary, the dependent verb must be in 
the Present if it denotes incomplete action, in the Perfect if it denotes 
completed action. 
b. If the leading verb is secondary, the dependent verb must be in 
the Imperfect if it denotes incomplete action, in the Pluperfect if it 
denotes completed action : — 
(1) He writes [primary] to warn [incomplete action] us, scribit ut nds moneat. 
I ask [primary] what you were doing [now past], rogé quid féceris. 
(2) He wrote [secondary] to warn [incomplete] us, scripsit ut nds monéret. 
T asked [secondary] what you were doing [incomplete], rogavi quid facerés. 
c. Notice that the Future Perfect denotes action completed (at 
the time referred to), and hence is represented in the Subjunctive by 
the Perfect or Pluperfect : — 
He shows that if they come (shall have come), many will perish, démonstrat, si 
vénerint, multés interitiirds. 
He showéd that if they should come (should have come), many would perish, 
démonstravit, si vénissent, multés interitirés. 
485. In the Sequence of Tenses the following special points 
are to be noted : — 
a. The Perfect Indicative is: ordinarily a secondary tense, but 
allows the primary sequence when the present time is clearly in the 
writer’s mind: — 
ut satis esset praesidi provisum est (Cat. ii. 26), provision has been made that 
there should be ample guard. [Secondary sequence. ] 
addixi hominem in qu6 satisfacere exteris natidnibus possétis (Verr. i. 2), I 
have brought a man in whose person you can make satisfaction to foreign 
nations. [Secondary sequence. ]

est enim rés iam in eum locum adducta, ut quamquam multum intersit inter 
edrum causis qui dimicant, tamen inter victorias ndn multum interfu- 
tirum putem (Fam. v. 21. 3), for affairs have been brought to such a pass 
that, though there is a great difference between the causes of those who are 
Sighting, still I do not think there will be much difference between their vic- 
tories. [Primary sequence.]  ~ 
ea adhibita doctrina est quae vel vitidsissimam natiiram excolere possit (Q. Fr. 
i. 1. 7), such instruction has been given as can train even the faultiest 
nature. [Primary sequence. ] 
Nors.— The Perfect Infinitive in exclamations follows the same rule: — 
quemquamne fuisse tam sceleratum qui hdc fingeret (Phil. xiv. 14), was any one so 
abandoned as to imagine this? [Secondary.] 
adedn rem redisse patrem ut extiméscam (Ter. Ph. 153), to think that things have 
come to such a pass that I should dread my father! [Primary.] 
b. After a primary tense the Perfect Subjunctive is regularly used to 
denote any pastaction. Thus the Perfect Subjunctivemay represent — 
1. A Perfect Definite :— 
non dubitd quin omnés tui scripserint (Fam. v. 8), I do not doubt that all 
your friends have written. [Direct statement: scripsérunt. ] 
qua ré-ndn igndrd quid accidat in ultimis terris, cum audierim in Italia que- 
rellas civium (Q. Fr. i. 1. 33), therefore I know well what happens at the 
ends of the earth, when I have heard in Italy the complaints of citizens. 
[Direct statement: audivi.] 
2. A Perfect Historical : — 
mé autem hic laudat quod rettulerim, nn quod patefécerim (Att. xii. 21), me 
he praises because I brought the matter [before the senate], not because I 
brought it to light. [Direct statement: rettulit.] 
3. An Imperfect : — 
si forte cecidérunt, tum intellegitur quam fuerint inopés amicdrum (Lael. 53), 
af perchance they fall (have fallen), then one can see how poor they were 
in friends. [Direct question: quam inopés erant?] 
qui status rérum fuerit cum has litteras dedi, scirée poteris ex C. Titid Stra- 
bone (Fam. xii. 6), what the condition of affairs was when I wrote this 
letter, you can learn from Strabo. [Direct question: qui status erat ?] 
quam civitati carus fuerit maerdre fineris indicatum est (Lael. 11), how dear 
he was to the state has been shown by the grief at his funeral. [Direct 
question: quam carus erat ?] 
ex epistulis intellegi licet quam frequéns fuerit Platonis auditor (Or. 15), it 
may be understood from his letters how constant a hearer he was of Plato. 
[Direct question: quam frequéns erat ?] 
Nortr. —Thus the Perfect Subjunctive may represent, not only a Perfect Definite 
or a Perfect Historical of a direct statement or question, but an Imperfect as well. 
This comes from the want of any special tense of the subjunctive for continued past 
action after a primary tense. Thus, miror quid fécerit may mean (1) I wonder what he 
has done, (2) I wonder what he did (hist. perf.), or (3) I wonder what he was doing.

§ 485] SEQUENCE OF TENSES 305 
c. In clauses of Result, the Perfect Subjunctive is regularly (the 
Present rarely) used after secondary tenses : — 
Horténsius ardébat dicendi cupiditate sic ut in nillo umquam flagrantius 
studium viderim (Brut. 302), Hortensius was so hot with desire of speak- 
ing that I have never seen a more burning ardor in any man. 
[Siciliam Verrés] per triennium ita vexAvit ac perdidit ut ea restitui in anti- 
quum statum niillé mod6 possit (Verr. i. 12), for three years Verres so 
racked and ruined Sicily that she can in no way be restored to her former 
state. [Here the Present describes a state of things actually existing.] 
videor esse cénseciitus ut non possit Dolabella in Italiam pervenire (Fam. 
xii. 14. 2), I seem to have brought it about that Dolabella cannot come into 
Italy. 
Nore 1.— This construction emphasizes the result; the regular sequence of tenses 
vould subordinate it. 
Nore 2.—There is a special fondness for the Perfect Subjunctive to represent a 
Perfect Indicative : — 
Thorius erat ita non superstitidsus ut illa plirima in sua patria et sacrificia et 
fana contemneret ; ita non timidus ad mortem ut in acié sit ob rem pablicam 
interfectus (Fin. ii. 63), Thorius was so little superstitious that he despised 
[contemnébat] the many sacrifices and shrines in his country ; so little timor- 
ous about death that he was killed [interfectus est] in battle, in defence of 
the state. 
ad. A general truth after a past tense follows the sequence of tenses: 
ex his quae tribuisset, sibi quam miitabilis esset reputabat (Q. C. iii. 8. 20), 
from what she (Fortune) had bestowed on him, he reflected how inconstant 
sheis. [Direct: mitabilis est.] = 
ibi quantam vim ad stimulandés animés ira habéret apparuit (Liv. xxxiii. 37), 
here it appeared what power anger has to goad the mind. [Direct : habet.] 
Norx. —In English the original tense is more commonly kept. 
e. The Historical Present (§ 469) is sometimes felt as a primary, 
sometimes as a secondary tense, and accordingly it takes either the 
primary or the secondary sequence : — 
rogat ut ciiret quod dixisset (Quinct. 18), he asks him to attend to the thing he 
had spoken of. [Both primary and secondary sequence. ] 
Nor. —After the historical present, the subjunctive with cum temporal must 
follow the secondary sequence : — 
quo cum vénisset cdgniscit (B. C. i. 34), when he had come there he learns. 
cum esset piigndtum hdris quinque, nostrique gravius premerentur, impetum in 
cohortis faciunt (id. i. 46), when they had fought for five hours, and our 
men were pretty hard pressed, they make an attack on the cohorts. 
f. The Historical Infinitive regularly takes the secondary se- 
quence : — 
interim cotidié Caesar Haedués frimentum, quod essent polliciti, flagitare 
(B. G. i. 16), meanwhile Cesar demanded of the Hedui every day the grain 
which they had promised.

  306 SYNTAX: THE VERB [§ 485 
g. The Imperfect and Pluperfect in conditions contrary to fact 
($ 517) and in the Deliberative Subjunctive (§ 444) are not affected 
by the sequence of tenses : — 
quia tale sit, ut vel si igndrarent id hominés vel si obmutuissent (Fin. ii. 49), 
because it is such that even if men were ignorant of it, or HAD BEEN 
silent about it. 
quaero 4 té cir C. Cornélium nin défenderem (Vat. 5), Task you why I was 
not to defend Caius Cornelius? ([Direct: cir non défenderem ?] 
h. The Imperfect Subjunctive in present conditions contrary to 
fact (§ 517) is regularly followed by the secondary sequence : — 
si alii cOnsulés essent, ad té potissimum, Paule, mitterem, ut eds mihi quam 
amicissimds redderés (Fam. xv. 13. 8), if there were other consuls, I should 
send to you, Paulus, in preference to all, that you might make them as 
Friendly to me as possible. 
si sdlds eds dicerés miserds quibus moriendum esset, néminem exciperés 
(Tuse. i. 9), if you were to call only those wretched who must die, you 
would except no one. 
i. The Present is sometimes followed by a secondary sequence, 
seemingly because the writer is thinking of past time : — 
sed si rés cOget, est quiddam tertium, quod neque Selicid nec mihi displicé- 
bat: ut neque iacére rem paterémur, etc. (Fam. i. 54. 3), but if the case 
shall demand, there is a third [course] which neither Selicius nor myself 
disapproved, that we should not allow, ete. [Here Cicero is led by the 
time of displicébat. ] 
sed tamen ut scirés, haec tibi scribd (Fam. xiii. 47), but yet that you may know, 1 
writethus. [As if he had used the epistolary imperfect scribébam (§ 479). ] 
etius praecepti tanta visest ut ea ndn homini cuipiam sed Delphicd ded 
tribuerétur (Legg. i. 58), such is the force of this precept, that it was 
ascribed not to any man, but to the Delphic god. [The precept was an 
old one.] 
gj» When a clause depends upon one already dependent, its se- 
quence may be secondary if the verb of that clause expresses past 
time, even if the main verb is in a primary tense : — 
sed tamen qua ré acciderit ut ex meis superidribus litteris id suspicdrére nescid

§ 486] TENSES OF THE INFINITIVE 307 
TENSES OF THE INFINITIVE 
486. Except in Indirect Discourse, only the Present and Per- 
fect Infinitives are used. 
The Present represents the action of the verb as in progress with- 
out distinct reference to time, the Perfect as completed. 
For the Tenses of the Infinitive in Indirect Discourse see § 584. 
a. With past tenses of verbs of necessity, propriety, and possibility 
(as débui, oportuit, potui), the Present Infinitive is often used in 
Latin where the English idiom prefers the Perfect Infinitive : — 
numne, si Coriolinus habuit amicés, ferre contra patriam arma illi cum 
Coriolané débuérunt (Lael. 36), if Coriolanus had friends, ought they to 
have borne arms with him against their fatherland ? 
peciinia, quam his oportuit civitatibus pro frimentd dari (Verr. iii. 174), 
money which ought to have been paid to these states for grain. 
consul esse qui potui, nisi eum vitae cursum tenuissem 4 pueritia (Rep. i. 10), 
how could I have become consul had I not from boyhood followed that 
course of life? 
b. With verbs of necessity, propriety, and possibility, the Perfect 
Infinitive may be used to emphasize the idea of completed action : — 
tametsi statim vicisse débed (Rose. Am. 73), although I ought to win my case 
at once (to be regarded as having won it). 
bellum quod possumus ante hiemem perfécisse (Liv. xxxvii. 19. 5), a war 
which we can have completed before winter. 
nil ego, si peccem, possum nescisse (Ov. H. xvi. 47), ¢f I should go wrong, 
I cannot have done it in ignorance (am not able not to have known). 
Norr. — With the past tenses of these verbs the perfect infinitive is apparently 
due to attraction: — 
quod iam pridem factum esse oportuit (Cat. i. 5), (a thing) which ought to have 
been done long ago. 
haec facta ab ills oportébat (Ter. Haut. 536), this ought to have been done by him. 
tum decuit metuisse (Aen. x. 94), then was the time to fear (then you should have 
feared). 
ec. Inarchaic Latin and in legal formulas the Perfect Active Infini- 
tive is often used with n6ld or vold in prohibitions : — 
Chaldaeum néquem cinsuluisse velit (Cato R. R. v. 4), let him not venture to 
have consulted a soothsayer. 
ndlitd dévellisse (Pl. Poen. 872), do not have them plucked. 
néquis humsse velit Aidcem (Hor. S. ii. 3. 187), let no one venture to have 
buried Ajax. 
NEIQVIS EORVM BACANAL HABVISE VELET (S. C. de Bac. 1), let no one of them 
venture to have had a place for Bacchanalian worship.

    808 SYNTAX: THE VERB [s 486 
d. With verbs of wishing! the Perfect Passive Infinitive (com- 
monly without esse) is often used emphatically instead of the Present: 
domestica ciira té levatum vol6 (Q. Fr. iii. 9. 8), I wish you relieved of private 
care. 
illds monitds vold (Cat. ii. 27), I wish them thoroughly warned. 
qui illam [patriam] exstinctam cupit (Fin. iv. 66), who is eager for her utter 
destruction. 
illud té esse admonitum volé (Cael. 8), I wish you to be well advised of this. 
qui sé ab omnibus désertés potius quam abs té défénsds esse mAlunt (Caecil. 
21), who prefer to be deserted by all rather than to be defended by you. 
Norr. — The participle in this case is rather in predicate agreement (with or with- 
out esse) than used to form a strict perfect infinitive, though the full form can hardly 
be distinguished from that construction. 
e. In late Latin, and in poetry (often for metrical convenience), 
rarely in good prose, the Perfect Active Infinitive is used emphatically 
instead of the Present, and even after other verbs than those of -wish- 
ing : — 
ném6 edrum est qui n6n perisse té cupiat (Verr. ii. 149), there is no one of 
them who is not eager for your death. 
haud equidem premendé alium mé extulisse velim (Liv. xxii. 59. 10), 7 
would not by crushing another exalt myself. 
sunt qui ndlint tetigisse (Hor. S. i. 2. 28), there are those who would not touch. 
commisisse cavet (Hor. A. P. 168), he is cautious of doing. 
nunc quem tetigisse timérent, anguis erds (Ov. M. viii. 733), again you be- 
came a serpent which they dreaded to touch. 
fratrésque tendentés opicd Pélion imposuisse Olympé (Hor. Od. iii. 4. 51), 
and the brothers striving to set Pelion on dark Olympus. 
f: After verbs of feeling the Perfect Infinitive is used, especially 
by the poets, to denote a completed action. 
So also with satis est, satis habed, melius est, contentus sum, and in 
a few other cases where the distinction of time is important : — 
ndn paenitébat intercapédinem scribendi fécisse (Fam. xvi. 21), I was not 
sorry to have made a respite of writing. 
pudet mé non praestitisse (id. xiv. 3), I am ashamed not to have shown. 
sunt qués pulverem Olympicum coliégisse iuvat (Hor. Od. i. 1. 3), some 
delight to have stirred up the dust at Olympia. 
quiésse erit melius (Liv. iii. 48), it will be better to have kept quiet. 
ac si quis amet scripsisse (Hor. S. i. 10. 60), than if one should choose to have 
written. 
id sdlum dixisse satis habed (Vell. ii. 124), I am content to have said only 
this.

PARTICIPLES 
488. The Participle expresses the action of the verb in the form 
of an Adjective, but has a partial distinction of tense and may 
govern a case. 
Norz.— Thus the participle combines all the functions of an adjective with some 
of the functions of a verb. As an Adjective, it limits substantives and agrees with 
them in gender, number, and case (§ 286). As a Verb, it has distinctions of time 
(§ 489) and often takes an object. 
Distinctions of Tense in Participles 
489. Participles denote time as present, past, or future with 
respect to the time of the verb in their clause. 
Thus the Present Participle represents the action as in progress at 
the time indicated by the tense of the verb, the Perfect as completed, 
and the Future as still to take place. 
490. The Present Participle has several of the special uses of 
the Present Indicative. Thus it may denote — 
1. An action continued in the present but begun in the past (§ 466) : 
quaerenti mihi iam diii certa rés nilla veniébat in mentem (Fam. iv. 18), 
though I had long sought, no certain thing came to my mind.

  310 SYNTAX: THE VERB [$$ 490-493 
2. Attempted action (§ 467): — 
C. Flaminio restitit agrum Picentem dividenti (Cat. M. 11), he resisted Fla- 
minius when attempting to divide the Picene territory. 
3. Rarely (in poetry and later Latin) futurity or purpose, with a 
verb of motion : — 
Eurypylum scitantem dracula mittimus (Aen. ii. 114), we send Eurypylus to 
consult the oracle. [Cf. § 468.] 
491. The Perfect Participle of a few deponent verbs is used 
nearly in the sense of a Present. 
Such are, regularly, ratus, solitus, veritus; commonly, arbitratus, 
fisus, ausus, seciitus, and occasionally others, especially in later 
writers : — 
rem incrédibilem rati (Sall. Cat. 48), thinking the thing incredible. 
insidias veritus (B. G. ii. 11), fearing an ambuscade. 
cohortatus milités docuit (B. C. iii. 80), encouraging the men, he showed. 
iratus dixisti (Mur. 62), you spoke in a passion. 
ad pignam congressi (Liv. iv. 10), meeting in fight. 
492. The Latin has no Present Participle in the passive. 
The place of such a form is supplied usually by a clause with dum 
or cum : — 
obiére dum calciantur matitind duo Caesarés (Plin. N. H. vii. 181), two 
Cesars died while having their shoes put on in the morning. 
méque ista délectant cum Latiné dicuntur (Acad. i. 18), those things please 
me when they are spoken in Latin. 
Norer.— These constructions are often used when a participle might be employed :— 
dic, hospes, Spartae nds té hic vidisse iacentis, dum sanctis patriae légibus obse- 
quimur (Tusc. i. 101), éel/ it, stranger, at Sparta, that you saw us lying here 
obedient to our country’s sacred laws. [Here dum obsequimur is a transla- 
tion of the Greek present participle wei@éuevor.] 
dum [Ulixés] sibi, dum sociis reditum parat (Hor. Ep. i. 2. 21), Ulysses, while 
securing the return of himself and his companions. [In Greek: dprbuevos-] 
493. The Latin has no Perfect Participle in the active voice. 
The deficiency is supplied — 
1. In deponents by the perfect passive form with its regular active 
meaning : — 
nam singulas [navis] nostri cénsectati expiignavérunt (B. G. iii. 15), for our 
men, having overtaken them one by one, captured them by boarding. 
Norx.—The perfect participle of several deponent verbs may be either active or 
passive in meaning (§ 190. d).
-P-A-G-E-323
  §§ 498-495] USES OF PARTICIPLES 311 
2. In other verbs, either by the perfect passive participle in the 
ablative absolute (§ 420. n.) or by a temporal clause (especially with 
cum or postquam) : — 
itaque convocatis centuridnibus milités certidrés facit (B. G. iii. 5), and 80, 
having called the centurions together, he informs the soldiers (the centu- 
rions having been called together). 
cum vénisset animadvertit collem (id. vii. 44), having come (when he had 
come), he noticed a hill. 
postquam id animum advertit copias suas Caesar in proximum collem subdicit 
(B. G. i. 24), having observed this (after he had observed this) Cesar 
led his troops to the nearest hill. 
Uses of Participles 
494, The Present and Perfect Participles are sometimes used 
as attributives, nearly like adjectives : — 
aeger et flagrans animus (Tac. Ann. iii. 54), his sick and passionate mind. 
cum antiquissimam sententiam tum comprobatam (Div. i. 11), a view at once 
most ancient and well approved. 
signa numquam feré mentientia (id. i. 15), signs hardly ever deceitful. 
auspiciis ituntur coactis (id. i. 27), they use forced auspices. 
- a, Participles often become complete adjectives, and may be com- 
pared, or used as nouns : — 
qué mulieri esset rés cautior (Caec. 11), that the matter might be more secure 
Sor the woman. 
in illis artibus praestantissimus (De Or. i. 217), preéminent in those arts. 
sibi indulgentés et corpori déservientés (Legg. i. 39), the self-indulgent, and 
slaves to the body (indulging themselves and serving the body). 
récté facta paria esse débent (Par. 22), right deeds (things rightly done) ought 
to be like in value (see § 821. b). 
male parta male dilabuntur (Phil. ii. 65), ill got, ill spent (things ill acquired 
are ill spent). 
cdnsuétids valentis (De Or. ii. 186), the habit of a man in health. 
495. Participles are often used as Predicate Adjectives. As 
such they may be joined to the subject by esse or a copulative verb 
(see § 283) : — 
Gallia est divisa (B. G. i. 1), Gaul is divided. 
locus qui nunc saeptus est (Liv. i. 8), the place which is now enclosed. 
vidétis ut senectiis sit operdsa et semper agéns aliquid et méliéns (Cat. M. 26), 
you see how busy old age is, always aiming and trying at something. 
némd adhiic convenire mé voluit cui fuerim occupatus (id. 32), nobody 
hitherto has [ever] wished to converse with me, to whom I have been 
“* engaged.”
-P-A-G-E-324
  312 SYNTAX: THE VERB - [S$ 495, 496 
Notr.—From this predicate use arise the compound tenses of the passive, —the 
participle of completed action with the incomplete tenses of esse developing the idea 
of past time: as, interfectus est, he was (or has been) killed, lit. he is having-been-killed 
(i.e, already slain). 
The perfect participle used with fui etc. was perhaps originally an intensified expres- 
sion in the popular language for the perfect, pluperfect, etc. 
At times these forms indicate a state of affairs no longer existing: — 
cdtem quoque eddem locd sitam fuisse memorant (Liv. i. 36. 5), they say that a 
whetstone was (once) deposited in this same place. [At the time of writing 
it was no longer there.] 
arma quae fixa in parietibus fuerant, humi inventa sunt (Div. i. 74), the arms 
which had been fastened on the walls were found upon the ground. 
But more frequently they are not to be distinguished from the forms with sum etc. 
The construction is found occasionally at all periods, but is most common in Livy 
and later writers. 
496. The Present and Perfect Participles are often used as a 
predicate, where in English a phrase or a subordinate clause would 
be more natural. 
In this use the participles express time, cause, occasion, condition, 
concession, characteristic (or description), manner, means, attendant 
circumstances ¢ — 
volventés hostilia cadavera amicum reperiébant (Sall. Cat. 61), while rolling 
over the corpses of the enemy they found a friend. [Time.] e 
paululum commoratus, signa canere iubet (id. 59), after delaying a little while, 
he orders them to give the signal. [Time.] 
longius prdsequi veritus, ad Cicerdnem pervénit (B. G. v. 52), because he 
Seared to follow further, he came to Cicero. [Cause.] 
qui sciret laxds dare iussus habénas (Aen. i. 63), who might know how to 
give them loose rein when bidden. [Occasion.] 
damnatum poenam sequi oportébat (B. G. i. 4), if condemned, punishment 
must overtake him. [Condition.] 
saliitem inspérantibus reddidisti (Marc. 21), you have restored a safety for 
which we did not hope (to [us] not hoping). [Concession.] 
Dardanius caput ecce puer détéctus (Aen. x. 183), the Trojan boy with his 
head uncovered. [Description.] 
nec trepidés in tisum poscentis aevi pauca (Hor. Od. ii. 11. 5), be not anxious 
for the needs of age that demands little. [Characteristic. ] 
incitati fuga montis altissimds petébant (B. C. iii. 93), in headlong flight they 
made for the highest mountains. [Manner.] 
milités sublevati alii ab aliis mignam partem itineris cdnficerent (id. i. 68), 
the soldiers, helped wp by each other, accomplished a considerable part of

either sitting or walking. [Attendant Circumstance. ]

  §§ 496, 497] USES OF PARTICIPLES 313 
Nore 1.— These uses are especially frequent in the Ablative Absolute (§ 420). 
Nore 2.— A codrdinate clause is sometimes compressed into a perfect participle: — 
instrictés drdinés in locum aequum dédicit (Sall. Cat. 59), he draws up the lines, 
and leads them to level ground. 
ut hés traductés necaret (B. G. v. 6), that he might carry them over and put them 
to death. 
Nore 3,—A participle with a negative often expresses the same idea which in 
English is given by without and a verbal noun: as, —miserum est nihil proficientem 
angi (N. D. iii. 14), it ts wretched to vex oneself without effecting anything. 
Norr 4,—Acceptum and expénsum as predicates with ferre and referre are book- 
keeping terms: as, —quas pecinias ferébat eis expénsds (Verr. ii. 170), what sums he 
charged to them. 
497, A noun and a passive participle are often so united that 
the participle and not the noun contains the main idea: —1! 
ante conditam condendamve urbem (Liv. Pref.), before the city was built or 
building. 
illi libertétem imminétam civium Romandrum non tulérunt; vos éreptam 
vitam neglegétis (Manil. 11), they did not endure the infringement of the 
citizens’ liberty ; will you disregard the destruction of their lives ? 
post natés hominés (Brut. 224), since the creation of man. 
iam 4 condita urbe (Phil. 9), even from the founding of the city. 
  a. The perfect participle with a noun in agreement, or in the 
neuter as an abstract noun, is used in the ablative with opus, need 
(cf. § 411. a): — 
opus facto est viaticd (Pl. Trin. 887), there is need of laying in provision. 
matiratd opus est (Liv. viii. 13. 17), there is need of haste. 
6. The perfect participle with habed (rarely with other verbs) has 
almost the same meaning as a perfect active, but denotes the contin- 
ued effect of the action of the verb:—?* 
fidem quam habent spectétam iam et dif cdgnitam (Caecil. 11), my fidelity, 
which they have proved and long known. 
cohortis in acié Lxxx cénstititas habébat (B. C. iii. 89), he had eighty cohorts 
stationed in line of battle. 
nefarids ducés captds iam et comprehénsds tenétis (Cat. iii. 16), you have now 
captured the infamous leaders and hold them in custody. 
  c. A verb of effecting or the like may be used in combination with 
the perfect participle of a transitive verb to express the action of that 
verb more forcibly : — 
1 Compare the participle in indirect discourse in Greek (Goodwin’s Greek Grammar, 
§ 1588) ; and the English “ ’T was at the royal feast for Persia won”’ (Dryden), i.e. for 
the conquest of Persia. 
2 The perfect with have, in modern languages of Latin stock, has grown out of this 
use of habed.

Norts. —Similarly vold (with its compounds) and cupid, with a perfect participle 
without esse (cf. § 486. d). 
da. After verbs denoting an action of the senses the present partici- 
ple in agreement with the object is nearly equivalent to the infinitive 
of indirect discourse (§ 580), but expresses the action more vividly: 
ut eum némd umquam in equé sedentem viderit (Verr. v. 27), so that no one 
ever saw him sitting on a horse. [Cf. Tusc. iii. 31.] 
Norr.—The same construction is used after facid, indiicd, and the like, with the 
name of an author as subject: as, — Xenophon facit Sdcratem disputantem (N. D. i. 
* 81), Xenophon represents Socrates disputing.    
Future Participle (Active) 
498. The Future Participle (except futirus and ventirus) is 
rarely used in simple agreement with-a noun, except by poets 
and later writers. 
a. The future participle is chiefly used with the forms of esse 
(often omitted in the infinitive) in the Active Periphrastic Conjuga- 
tion (see § 195): — 
morere, Diagora, non enim in caelum adscénsiirus es (Tusc. i. 111), die, 
Diagoras, for you are not likely to rise to heaven. 
spérat aduléscéns diii sé victiirum (Cat. M. 68), the young man hopes to live 
long (that he shall live long). 
neque petitirus umquam consulatum vidérétur (Off. iii. 79), and did not seem 
likely ever to be a candidate for the consulship. 
b. With the past tenses of esse in the indicative, the future parti- 
ciple is often equivalent to the pluperfect subjunctive (§ 517. d). 
For futiirum fuisse, see § 589. 4. 
499. By later writers and the poets the Future Participle is 
often used in simple agreement with a substantive to express — 
1. Likelihood or certainty : — 
rem ausus pliis famae habitiiram (Liv. ii. 10), having dared a thing which would 
have more repute.
-P-A-G-E-327
  §§ 499, 500] GERUNDIVE . 315 
2. Purpose, intention, or readiness : — 
égreditur castris Romanus vallum invasirus (Liv. iii. 60. 8), the Roman comes 
out of the camp with the intention of attacking the rampart. 
dispersds per agros milités equitibus invasiiris (id. xxxi. 36), while the horse 
were ready to attack the soldiers scattered through the fields. 
si peritirus abis (Aen. ii. 675), if you are going away to perish. 
8. Apodosis : — 
dedit mihi quantum maximum potuit, datirus amplius si potuisset (Plin. Ep. 
iii. 21. 6), he gave me as much as he could, ready to give me more if he 
had been able. [Here datirus is equivalent to dedisset. ] 
Gerundive (Future Passive Participle) 
Nore. —The participle in -dus, commonly called the Gerundive, has two distinct 
uses: — 
(1) Its predicate and attribute use as Participle or Adjective (§ 500). 
(2) Its use with the meaning of the Gerund (§ 503). This may be called its gerun- 
dive use. 
500. The Gerundive when used as a Participle or an Adjective 
is always passive, denoting necessity, obligation, or propriety. 
In this use of the Gerundive the following points are to be 
observed : — 
1. The gerundive is sometimes used, like the present and perfect 
participles, in simple agreement with a noun : — 
fortem et cdnservandum virum (Mil. 104), a brave man, and worthy to be pre- 
served. 
gravis initiria facta est et ndn ferenda (Flacc. 84), a grave and intolerable 
wrong has been done. 
2. The most frequent use of the gerundive is with the forms of esse 
in the Second (or passive) Periphrastic Conjugation (see § 196) : — 
non agitanda rés erit (Verr. v. 179), will not the thing have to be agitated? 
8. The neuter gerundive of both transitive and intransitive verbs 
may be used impersonally in the second periphrastic conjugation. 
With verbs that take the dative or ablative, an object may be ex- 
pressed in the appropriate case; with transitive verbs, an object in 
the accusative is sometimes found : — 
tempori serviendum est (Fam. ix. 7. 2), one must obey the time. 
légibus parendum est, the laws must be obeyed. 
dtendum exercitatidnibus modicis (Cat. M. 36), we must use moderate exercise. 
agitandumst vigilias (Pl. Trin. 869), I have got to stand guard. 
via quam nobis ingrediendum sit (Cat. M. 6), the way we have to enter.  
-P-A-G-E-328
    816 : SYNTAX: THE VERB [§§ 500-508 
4. After verbs signifying to give, deliver, agree for, have, receive, 
undertake, demand, a gerundive in agreement with the object is used 
to express purpose : — 
redémptor qui columnam illam condiixerat faciendam (Div. ii. 47), the con- 
tractor who had undertaken to make that column. [The regular construc- 
tion with this class of verbs. ] 
aedem Castoris habuit tuendam (Verr. ii. 1. 150), he had the temple of Castor 
to take care of. 
navis atque onera adservanda ciiradbat (id. v. 146), he took care that the ships 
and cargoes should be kept. 
GERUND 
501. The Gerund is the neuter of the Gerundive, used sub- 
stantively in the Geitive, Dative, Accusative, and: Ablative. 
502. The Gerund expresses an action of the verb in the form 
of a verbal noun. 
As a noun the gerund is itself governed by other words; as a 
verb it may take an object in the proper case: — 
ars bene disserendi et véra ac falsa diididicandi (De Or. ii, 157), the art of dis- 
coursing well, and distinguishing the true and the false. 
Notr.— The Nominatiye of the gerund is supplied by the Infinitive. Thus in the 
example above, the verbal nouns discoursing and distinguishing, if used in the nomi- 
native, would be expressed by the infinitives disserere and diiiidicare, 
The Gerund is the neuter of the gerundive used impersonally, but retaining the 
verbal idea sufficiently to govern an object. It may therefore be regarded as a noun 
(cf. mAtiratd opus est, § 497. a) with a verbal force (cf. istanc tactid, p. 240, footnote). 
GERUND AND GERUNDIVE 
503, When the Gerund would have an object in the Accusa- 
tive, the Gerundive? is generally used instead. The gerundive 
agrees with its noun, which takes the case that the gerund would 
have had: — 
paratidrés ad omnia pericula subeunda (B. G. i. 5), readier to undergo all 
dangers. [Here subeunda agrees with pericula, which is itself governed 
by ad. The (inadmissible) construction with the gerund would be ad 
subeundum pericula ; ad governing the gerund, and the gerund governing 
the accusative pericula.] For details, see §§ 504-507. 
1 Such verbs are accipid, adndtd, attribub, condiicé, ciird, déndtd, déposcd, 6, dividd, 
don6, Edicd, Edoced, ferd, habed, locd, mando, obicid, permittd, petd, pond, praebed, propond,

  §§ 508, 504] GENITIVE OF GERUND AND GERUNDIVE 317 
Nore 1.—In this use the gerund and the gerundive are translated in the same 
way, but have really a different construction. The gerundive is a passive participle, 
and agrees with its noun, though in translation we change the voice, just as we may 
translate vigiliae agitandae sunt (guard must be kept) by I must stand guard. 
Nore 2.— In the gerundive construction the verbs titor, fruor, etc., are treated like 
transitive verbs governing the accusative, as they do in early Latin (§ 410. a.n.1): as, 
—ad perfruendds voluptatés (Off. i. 25), for enjoying pleasures. 
a. The following examples illustrate the parallel constructions of 
Gerund and Gerundive : — 
urbem capiendi 
urbis capiendae 
agrés colendd } aS aera cslantia he attends to tilling the fields. 
mihi parendum to obey me. 
pacem petendam } ee ycaie (Go seek peace. 
{ scribendd epistulas 
it scribendis epistulis Gen. consilium { } a design of taking the city. 
Daz. dat operam { 
Acc. veniunt ad { 
Ast. terit tempus } he spends time in writing letters. 
Notr1.—The gerund with a direct object is practically limited to the Genitive and 
the Ablative (without a preposition) ; even in these cases the gerundive is commoner. 
Norr 2.—The gerund or gerundive is often found codrdinated with nominal con- 
structions, and sometimes even in apposition with a noun: — 
(1) in ford, in ciiria, in amicdrum periculis propulsandis (Phil. vii. 7), in the forum, 
in the senate-house, in defending my friends in jeopardy. 
(2) ad rés diversissimas, parendum atque imperandum (Liv. xxi. 4), for the most 
widely different things, obeying and commanding. 
Genitive of the Gerund and Gerundive 
504. The Genitive of the Gerund and Gerundive is used after 
nouns or adjectives, either as subjective or objective genitive : — 
vivendi finis est optimus (Cat. M. 72), it is the best end of living. [Sub- 
jective.] 
neque consili habendi neque arma capiendi spatid datd (B. G. iv. 14), time being 
given neither for forming plans nor for taking arms. [Objective.] 
non tam commiitandirum quam évertendarum rérum cupidés (Off. ii. 8), desir- 
ous not so much of changing as of destroying the state. [Objective.] 
Nors 1.— In these uses the gerund and the gerundive are about equally common. 
Nore 2.—In a few phrases the Infinitive is used with nouns which ordinarily 
have the genitive of the gerund or gerundive: as, —tempus est abire, it is ¢ime to go. 
a. The genitive of the gerund sometimes takes a direct object, espe- 
cially a neuter pronoun or a neuter adjective used substantively : — 
nilla causa ifista cuiquam esse potest contra patriam arma capiendi (Phil. ii. 
58), no one can have a just cause for taking up arms against his country. 
artem véra ac falsa diitidicandi (De Or. ii. 157), the art of distinguishing true 
From false.

  318 SYNTAX: THE VERB [$§ 504, 505 
Nore 1.—The genitive of the gerund or gerundive is used (especially in later Latin) 
as a predicate genitive. When so used it often expresses purpose : — 
quae postquam gloridsa modo neque belli patrandi cdgndvit (Iug. 88), when he 
perceived that these were only brilliant deeds and not likely to end the war. 
Aegyptum proficiscitur cOgnéscendae antiquitatis (Tac. Ann. ii. 59), he sets out for 
Egypt to study old times.

genitive instead of taking a direct object : — 
réiciendi trium iidicum potestas (Verr. ii. 77), the power of challenging three 
Jurors (of the rejecting of three jurors). 
sui colligendi facultas (B. G. iii. 6), the opportunity to recover themselves. 
Dative of the Gerund and Gerundive

expressions after verbs : — 1 
diem praestitit operi faciendd (Verr. ii. 1. 148), he appointed a day for doing the 
work. 
praeesse agro colendd (Rosc. Am. 50), to take charge of cultivating the land. 
esse solvends, to be able to pay (to be for paying). 
Nore. — The dative of the gerund with a direct object is never found in classic 
Latin, but occurs twice in Plautus. 
a. The dative of the gerund. and gerundive is used after adjec- 
tives,’ especially those which denote fitness or adaptability: — 
genus armdrum aptum tegendis corporibus (Liv. xxxii. 10), a sort of armor 
suited to the defence of the body. 
reliqua tempora démetendis friictibus et percipiendis accommodata sunt (Cat. M. 
70), the other seasons are fitted to reap and gather in the harvest. 
perferendis militum mandatis idéneus (Tac. Ann. i. 28), suitable for carrying 
out the instructions of the soldiers. 
Norx. — This construction is very common in Livy and later writers, infrequent 
in classical prose. 
1 Such are praeesse, operam dare, diem dicere, locum capere, 
2 Such are accommodatus, aptus, ineptus, bonus, habilis, iddneus, par, utilis, iniitilis, 
But the accusative with ad is common with most of these (¢&. § 385. a).
-P-A-G-E-331
    §§ 505-507] ABLATIVE OF GERUND AND GERUNDIVE 319 
6. The dative of the gerund and gerundive is used in certain legal 
phrases after nouns meaning officers, offices, elections, etc., to indicate 
the function or scope of the office ete.: — 
comitia consulibus rogandis (Div. i. 38), elections for nominating consuls. 
triumvir coldniis dédicundis (Iug. 42), a triumvir for planting colonies. 
triumviri rei piblicae cOnstituendae (title of the Triumvirate), ¢riwmvirs (a com- 
mission of three) for settling the government. 
Accusative of the Gerund and Gerundive 
506. The Accusative of the Gerund and Gerundive is used 
after the preposition ad, to denote Purpose (ef. § 533): — 
mé6 yocas ad scribendum (Or. 34), you summon me to write. 
vivis nin ad dépdnendam sed ad confirmandam audaciam (Cat. i. 4), you live 
not to put off but to confirm your daring. 
nactus aditiis ad ea cdnanda (B. C. i. 31), having found means to undertake 
these things. s 
Nore 1.— Other prepositions appear in this construction ; inter and ob a few times, 
circd, in, ante, and a few others very rarely: as, inter agendum (Ecl. ix. 24), while 
driving. 
Nore 2.— The Accusative of the gerund with a preposition never takes a direct 
object in classic Latin. 
Ablative of the Gerund and Gerundive 
507. The Ablative of the Gerund and Gerundive is used (1) 
to express manner, means, cause, etc.; (2) after Comparatives; 
and (8) after the propositions ab, dé, ex, in, and (rarely) pro: — 
(1) multa pollicendd persuddet (Ing. 46), he persuades by large promises. 
Latiné loquendé cuivis par (Brut. 128), equal to any man in speaking Latin. 
his ipsis legendis (Cat. M. 21), by reading these very things. 
obsciiram atque humilem conciendé ad sé multitidinem (Liv. i. 8), calling to 
them a mean and obscure multitude. 
(2) niillum officium referenda gratia magis necessarium est (Off. i. 47), no duty 
is more important than repaying favors. 
(8) in ré gerenda versari (Cat. M. 17), to be employed in conducting affairs. 
Nore 1.—The Ablative of the Gerund and Gerundive is also very rarely used 
with verbs and adjectives: as, —nec continuandd abstitit magistrati (Liv. ix. 34), he 
did not desist from continuing his magistracy. 
Nore 2.—The ablative of the gerund rarely takes a direct object in classic prose. 
1In this use the ablative of the gerund is, in later writers nearly, and in mediswval 
writers entirely, equivalent to a present participle: as, —cum ind diérum rLENDO sédis- 
set, quidam miles generdsus ifixta eam EQUITANDO vénit (Gesta Romanorum, 66 [58]), 
as one day she sat weeping, a certain knight came riding by (compare § 507, fourth 
example). Hence come the Italian and Spanish forms of the present participle (as man- 
dando, esperando), the true participial form becoming an adjective in those languages.

    320 SYNTAX: THE VERB [§§ 608-510 
SUPINE 
508. The Supine is a verbal abstract of the fourth declension (§ 94. 0), having no 
distinction of tense or person, and limited to two uses. (1) The form in -um is the 
Accusative of the end of motion (§ 428. i). (2) The form in -i is usually Dative of pur- 
pose: (§ 382), but the Ablative was early confused with it. 
509. The Supine in -um is used after verbs of motion to express’ 
purpose. It may take an object in the proper case : — 
quid est, imusne sessum? etsi admonitum vénimus té, ndn flagitatum (De Or. 
iii. 17), how now, shall we be seated? though we have come to remind, not 
to entreat you. 
niptum dare (collocare), to give in marriage. 
vénérunt questum initirias (Liv. iii. 25), they came to complain of wrongs. 
My 1.—The supine in -um is especially common with ed, and with the passive 
infinrefRe iri forms the future infinitive passive: — 
fuére civés qui rem piiblicam perditum irent (Sall. Cat. 36), there were citizens who 
went about to ruin the republic. 
Si sciret sé trucidatum iri (Div. ii. 22), if he (Pompey) had known that he was 
going to be murdered. [Rare except in Cicero. For the more usual way of 
expressing the future passive infinitive, see § 569. 3. a.] 
Nore 2.— The supine in -um is occasionally used when motion is merely implied. 
510. The Supine in-i! is used with a few adjectives and with 
the nouns fas, nefas, and opus, to denote an action in reference to 
which the quality is asserted : — 
rem nén modo visi foedam, sed etiam audita (Phil. ii. 63), a thing not only 
shocking to see, but even to hear of. 
quaerunt quid optimum facti sit (Verr. ii. 1. 68), they ask what is best to do. 
si hic fas est dict (Tusc. v. 88), if this is lawful to say. 
yidétis nefas esse dictii miseram fuisse talem senectiitem (Cat. M. 13), you 
see it is a sin to say that such an old age was wretched. 
Nore 1.— The supine in -i is thus in appearance an Ablative of Specification (§ 418). f 
Nors 2.— The supine in -i is found especially with such adjectives as indicate an 
effect on the senses or the feelings, and. those which denote ease, difficulty, and the 
like. But with facilis, difficilis, and iticundus, ad with the gerund is more common: — 
nec visi facilis nec dictii adfabilis alli (Aen. iii. 621), he is not pleasant for.any 
man to look at or address. 
difficilis ad distinguendum similitidd (De Or. ii. 212), a likeness difficult to dis- 
tinguish. 
Nore 3.— With all these adjectives the poets often use the Infinitive in the same 
sense: as, —facilés aurem praebére (Prop. ii. 21. 15), indulgent to lend an ear. 
Nore 4.—The supine in -i with a verb is extremely rare: as, —pudet dicti (Tac. 
Agr. 32), it is a shame to tell. [On the analogy of pudendum dicti.] 
    1 The only common supines in -ii are auditi, dictii, fact, inventi, memorAti, nati, 
visti. In classic use this supine is found in comparatively few verbs. It is never 
followed by an object-case.

  § 611] CONDITIONAL SENTENCES 821 
CONDITIONAL SENTENCES 
511. The Conditional Sentence differs from other complex sentences in this, that 
the form of the main clause (APoposIs) is determined in some degree by the nature 
of the subordinate clause (PROTASIS) upon the truth of which the whole statement 
depends. Like all complex sentences, however, the Conditional Sentence has arisen 
from the use of two independent sentence-forms to express the parts of a thought 
which was too complicated to be fully expressed by a simple sentence. But because 
the thoughts thus expressed are in reality closely related, as parts of a single whole, the 
sentences which represent them are also felt to be mutually dependent, even though 
the relation is not expressed by any connecting word. Thus, Speak the word: my ser- 
vant shall be healed is a simpler and an earlier form of expression than If thou speak 
the word, ete. 
The Conditional Particles were originally pronouns without conditional mean- 
ing: thus, si, if, is a weak demonstrative of the same origin as sic, so (si-ce like 
hi-ce, see § 215. 5), and had originally the meaning of in that way, or in some way. 
Its relative sense (i/) seems to have come from its use with sic to make a pair of Gyit_la- 
tives: thus... thus (see § 512. b). 
In its origin the Conditional Sentence assumed one of two forms. The condition 
was from the first felt to be a condition, not a fact or a command; but, as no special 
sentence-form for a condition was in use, it employed for its expression either a state- 
ment of fact (with the Indicative) or a form of mild command (the Subjunctive). 
From the former have come all the uses of the Indicative in protasis; from the latter 
all the uses of the Subjunctive in protasis. The Apodosis has either (1) the Indicative, 
expressing the conclusion as a fact, and the Present and Perfect Subjunctive, express- 
ing it originally as futwre—and hence more or less douwbiful—or (2) the Imperfect 
and Pluperfect Subjunctive expressing it as futirum in praeteritd,! and so unfulfilled 
in the present or past. Thus, —ridés, mAidre cachinné concutitur, you laugh, he shakes 
with more boisterous laughter, is the original form for the Indicative in protasis and 
apodosis; si ridés originally means merely you laugh in some way or other, and so, 
later, ur you laugh. So rogés Aristénem, neget, ask Aristo, he would say no, is the 
original form of the subjunctive in protasis and apodosis; si rogés would mean ask in 
some way or other. In sirogares, negaret, the Imperfect rogarés transfers the command 
of rogés to past time,? with the meaning suppose you had asked, and si would have the 
same meaning as before; while negaret transfers the future idea of neget to past time, 
and means he was. going to deny. Now the stating of this supposition at all gives 
rise to the implication that it is untrue in point of fact, — because, if it were true, 
there would ordinarily be no need to state it as a supposition: for it would then be a 
simple fact, and as such would be put in theindicative.8 Sucha condition or conclusion   
1 The futiirum in praeteritd is a tense future relatively to a time absolutely past. 
It denotes a future act transferred to the point of view of past time, and hence is 
naturally expressed by a past tense of the Subjunctive: thus dixisset, he would have 
said = dictirus fuit, he was about to say [but did not]. As that which looks towards 
the future from some point in the past has a natural limit in present time, such a 
tense (the imperfect subjunctive) came naturally to be used to express a present con- 
dition purely ideal, that is to say, contrary to fact. 
2 Compare potius diceret, he should rather have said (§ 439. b). 
8 There are, however, some cases in which this implication does not arise: as, — 
deciéus centéna dedissés, nil erat in loculis (Hor. 8, i. 3. 15), Y you’d given him a mil- 
lion, there was nothing in his coffers. ‘ws
-P-A-G-E-334
          322 SYNTAX: CONDITIONAL SENTENCES [§§ 511, 512 
(originally past, meaning suppose you had asked [yesterday], he was going to deny) 
came to express an unfulfilled condition in the present: suppose (or if) you were 
now asking, he would [now] deny — just as in English ought, which originally meant 
owed,! has come to express a present obligation. 
For the classification of Conditional Sentences, see § 513. 
PROTASIS AND APODOSIS 
512. A complete Conditional Sentence consists of two clauses, 
the Protasis and the Apodosis. 
The clause containing the condition is called the PRorTASIS ; 
the clause containing the conclusion is called the APoDosIS : — 
si qui exire volunt [prorasis], cénivére possum [apoposts] (Cat. ii. 27), if 
any wish to depart, I can keep my eyes shut. 
si est in exsilid [prorasis], quid amplius postulatis [aroposis] (Lig. 13), if 
he is in exile, what more do you ask? 
It should be carefully noted that the Apodosis is the main clause 
and the Protasis the dependent clause. 
a, The Protasis is regularly introduced by the conditional particle 
si, if, or one of its compounds. 
Nore. — These compounds are sin, nisi, etiam si, etsi, tametsi, tamenetsi (see Condi- 
tional and Concessive Particles, p. 138). An Indefinite Relative, or any relative or 
concessive word, may also serve to introduce a conditional clause: see Conditional 
Relative Clauses (§§ 519, 542) ; Concessive Clauses (§ 527). 
6. The Apodosis is often introduced by some correlative word or 
phrase : as, ita, tum (rarely sic), or e condicidne etc.: — 
ita enim senectiis honesta est, si sé ipsa défendit (Cat. M. 88), on this condi- 
tion is old age honorable, if it defends itself. 
si quidem mé amiret, tum istuc prddesset (Ter. Eun. 446), if he loved me, 
then this would be profitable. 
sic scribés aliquid, si vacabis (Att. xii. 88. 2), if you are (shall be) at leisure, 
then you will write something. 
ec. The Apodosis is the principal clause of the conditional sen- 
tence, but may at the same time be subordinate to some other 
clause, and so appear in the form of a Participle, an Infinitive, or 
a Phrase : — 
sepultiira quoque prohibitiri, ni réx humari iussisset (Q. C. viii. 2. 12), intend- 
ing also to deprive him of burial, unless the king had ordered him to be 
interred. 
1“ There was a certain lender which ought him five hundred pieces.” — Tyndale’s 
New Testament.

quod si praetered ném6 sequatur, tamen sé cum s6la decima legidne itirum

the tenth legion alone. 
si qués adversum proelium commovéret, his reperire posse (id. 40. 8), if the 
loss of a batile alarmed any, they might find, etc. 
Norge. — When the Apodosis itself is in Indirect Discourse, or in any other depend- 
ent construction, the verb of the Protasis is regularly in the Subjunctive (as in the above 
examples, see § 589). 
CLASSIFICATION OF CONDITIONS 
513. Conditions are either (1) Particular or (2) General. 
1. A Particular Condition refers to a definite act or series of acts 
occurring at some definite time. 
2, A General Condition refers to any one of a class of acts which 
may occur (or may have occurred) at any time. 
514. The principal or typical forms of Conditional Sentences 
may be exhibited as follows: — 
PARTICULAR CONDITIONS 
A, StmpLE Conpitions (nothing implied as to fulfilment) 
1. Present Time 
Present Indicative in both clauses: — 
si adest, bene est, if he is [now] here, it is well. 
2. Past Time 
Imperfect or Perfect Indicative in both clauses: — 
si aderat, bene erat, if he was [then] here, it was well. 
si adfuit, bene fuit, if he has been [was] here, it has been [was] well. 
B. FururE Conpirions (as yet unfulfilled) 
1. More Vivid 
a. Future Indicative in both clauses: — 
si aderit, bene erit, if he is (shall be) here, it will be well. 
b. Future Perfect Indicative in protasis, Future Indicative in 
apodosis: — 
si adfuerit, bene erit, if he is (shall have been) here, it will [then] be well.
-P-A-G-E-336
  824 SYNTAX: CONDITIONAL SENTENCES [§ 614 
2. Less Vivid 
a. Present Subjunctive in both clauses: — 
si adsit, bene sit, if he should be (or were to be) here, it would be well. 
b. Perfect Subjunctive in protasis, Present Subjunctive in apod- 
osi 
  si adfuerit, bene sit, if he should be (should have been) here, it would [then] 
be well. ‘ 
C. Conpitions ContRARY TO Fact 
1. Present Time 
Imperfect Subjunctive in both clauses: — 
si adesset, bene esset, if he were [now] here, it would be well (but he is nor here). 
2. Past Time : 
Pluperfect Subjunctive in both clauses: — 
si adfuisset, bene fuisset, if he had [then] been here, it would have been well 
(but he was nor here). 
Norsr.—The use of tenses in Protasis is very loose in English. Thus éf he is 
alive now is a PRESENT condition, to be expressed in Latin by the Present Indicative ; 
if he is alive next year is a FUTURE condition, expressed in Latin by the Future 
Indicative. Again, if he were here now is a PRESENT condition contrary to fact, 
and would be expressed by the Imperfect Subjunctive; if he were to see me thus 
is a FUTURE condition less vivid, to be expressed by the Present Subjunctive; and so 
too, if you advised him, he would attend may be future less vivid.t 
D. GENERAL CONDITIONS 
General Conditions do not usually differ in form from Particular 
Conditions (A, B, and C), but are sometimes distinguished in the 
cases following : — 
1. Present General Condition (Indefinite Time) 
a. Present Subjunctive sécond person singular (Indefinite Subject) 
in protasis, Present Indicative in apodosis: — 
si hic dicas, créditur, if any one [ever] says this, it is [always] believed. 
b. Perfect Indicative in protasis, Present Indicative in apodosis: 
si quid dixit, créditur, if he [ever] says anything, it is [always] believed. 
1In most English verbs the Preterite (or Past) Subjunctive is identical in form 
with the Preterite Indicative. Thus in such a sentence as ¢ he loved his father, he 
would not say this, the verb loved is really a Preterite Subjunctive, though this does 
not appear from the inflection. In the verb to be, however, the Subjunctive were has 
been preserved and differs in form from the indicative was.
-P-A-G-E-337
  §§ 514, 515] SIMPLE PRESENT AND PAST CONDITIONS 825 
2. Past General Condition (Repeated Action in Past Time) 
a. Pluperfect Indicative in protasis, Imperfect Indicative in apod- 
osis : — 
si quid dixerat, crédébatur, if he [ever] said anything, it was [always] believed. 
b. Imperfect Subjunctive in protasis, Imperfect Indicative in apod- 
osis : — 
si quid diceret, crédébatur, if he [ever] said anything, it was [always] 
believed (= whatever he said was always believed).1 
PARTICULAR CONDITIONS 
Simple Present and Past Conditions — Nothing Implied 
515. In the statement of Present and Past conditions whose 
falsity is Nov implied, the Present and Past tenses of the Indica- 
tive are used in both Protasis and Apodosis : — 
si tii exercitusque valétis, bene est (Fam. vy. 2), if you and the army are well, 
it is well. [Present Condition. ] 
haec igitur, si Romae es; sin abes, aut etiam si ades, haec negotia sic sé habent 
(Att. v. 18), this, then, if you are at Rome; but if you are away — or even 
if you are there — these matters are as follows. [Present Condition.] 
si Caesarem probatis, in mé offenditis (B. C. ii. 32. 10), if you favor Cesar, 
you find fault with me. [Present Condition.] 
si qui magnis ingeniis in ed genere exstitérunt, nn satis Graecdrum gloriae 
respondérunt (Tuse. i. 3), if any have shown themselves of great genius in 
that department, they have failed to compete with the glory of the Greeks. 
[Past General Condition, not distinguished in form from Particular. ] 
accépi Roma sine epistula tua fasciculum litterarum in qué, si modo valuisti 
et Romae fuisti, Philotimi diicd esse culpam non tuam (Att. v. 17), Ihave 
received from Rome a bundle of letters without any from you, which, pro- 
vided you have been well and at Rome, I take to be the fault of Philotimus, 
not yours. [Mixed: Past condition and Present conclusion. ] 
quis litteras, si Romae es, vidébis putésne reddendas (id. v. 18), as to this 
letter, if you are at Rome, you will see whether in your opinion it ought 
to be delivered. [Mixed: Present and Future. ] 
si némd impetravit, adroganter rogé (Lig. 30), if no one has succeeded in obtain- 
ing it, my request is presumptuous. [Past and Present.]

326 SYNTAX: CONDITIONAL SENTENCES [S$ 515, 516 
a. In these conditions the apodosis need not always be in the In- 
dicative, but may assume any form, according to the sense : — 
si placet . . . videamus (Cat. M. 15), if you please, let us see. [Hortatory 
Subjunctive, § 439.] 
si ndndum satis cernitis, recordamini (Mil. 61), if you do not yet see clearly, 
recollect. [Imperative. ] 
‘si quid habés certius, velim scire (Att. iv. 10), you have any trustworthy 
information, I should like to know it. [Subjunctive of Modesty, § 447. 1.] 
Nor. — Although the form of these conditions does not imply anything as to the 
truth of the supposition, the sense or the context may of course have some such impli- 
cation:   
   ite, si in nostrd omnium flétii nillam lacrimam aspexistis Milonis, hoe minus 
ei parcere (Mil. 92), do not, if amid the weeping of us all you have seen no 
tear [in the eyes] of Milo, spare him the less for that. 
petimus 4 vobis, iiidicés, si qua divina in tantis ingeniis commendatid débet 
esse, ut eum in vestram accipiatis fidem (Arch. 31), we ask you, judges, 
¢f there ought to be anything in such genius to recommend it to us as 
by a recommendation of the gods, that you receive him under your pro- 
tection. 
In these two passages, the protasis really expresses cause: but the cause is put by 
the speaker in the form of a non-committal condition. His hearers are to draw the 
inference for themselves. In this way the desired impression is made on their minds 
more effectively than if an outspoken causal clause had been used. 
Future Conditions 
516. Future Conditions may be more vivid or less vivid. 
1. Ina more vivid future condition the protasis makes a distinct 
supposition of a future case, the apodosis expressing what will be the 
logical result. 
2. In a less vivid future condition, the supposition is less distinct, 
the apodosis expressing what would be the result in the case supposed. 
a. In the more vivid future condition the Future Indicative is used 
in both protasis and apodosis : — 
sanabimur, si volémus (Tuse. iii. 13), we shall be healed if we wish. 
quod si legere aut audire volétis, . . . reperiétis (Cat. M. 20), if you will 
[shall wish to] read or hear, you will find. 
Norre.—In English the protasis is usually expressed by the Present Indicative, 
rarely by the Future with sat. Often in Latin the Present Indicative is found in 
the protasis of a condition of this kind (cf. § 468) :— si vincimus, omnia nobis tiita erunt ; sin metii cesserimus, eadem illa advorsa fient 
(all. Cat. 58), if we conquer, all things will be safe for us; but if we yield 
through fear, those same things will become hostile. 
si pered, hominum manibus periisse iuvabit (Aen. iii. 606), if I perish, it will be 
pleasant to have perished at the hands of men.
-P-A-G-E-339
  § 516] FUTURE CONDITIONS 827 
b. In the less vivid future condition the Present Subjunctive is 
used in both protasis and apodosis : — 
haec si técum patria loquatur, ndnne impetrare débeat (Cat. i. 19), if your 
country should thus speak with you, ought she not to prevail? 
quod si quis deus mihi largiatur, . . . valdé reciisem (Cat. M. 83), but if some 
god were to grant me this, I should stoutly refuse. 
Nors.—The Present Subjunctive sometimes stands in protasis with the Future 
(or the Present) Indicative in apodosis from a change in the point of view: —1 
si diligenter attendamus, intellegémus (Inv. ii. 44), if we attend (should attend) 
carefully, we shall understand. 
nisi hdc dicat, “‘itire féci,” ndn habet défénsidnem (id. i. 18), unless he should 
say this, “I acted justifiably,” he has no defence. 
ce. If the conditional act is regarded as completed before that of the 
apodosis begins, the Future Perfect is substituted for the Future 
Indicative in protasis, and the Perfect Subjunctive for the Present 
Subjunctive : — 
sin cum potuer6 n6n vénerd, tum erit inimicus (Att. ix. 2 a. 2), but if I do not 
come when I can, he will be unfriendly. 
si @ cordna relictus sim, ndn queam dicere (Brut. 192), if I should be deserted 
by the circle of listeners, I should not be able to speak. 
Norr.—The Future Perfect is often used in the apodosis of a future condition: 
as, —vehementer mihi gratum féceris, si hunc aduléscentem himanitate tua compre- 
henderis (Fam. xiii. 15), you will do (will have done) me a great favor, if you receive 
this young man with your usual courtesy. 
d, Any form denoting or implying future time may stand in the 
apodosis of a future condition. So the Imperative, the participles in 
-dus and -rus, and verbs of necessity, possibility, and the like : — 
alius finis cénstituendus est, si prius quid maximé reprehendere Scipié solitus 
sit dixerd (Lael. 59), another limit must be set, if I first state what Scipio 
was wont most to find fault with. 
si mé praecéperit fatum, vos mandasse mementé (Q. C. ix. 6. 26), if fate cuts 
me off too soon, do you remember that I ordered this. 
nisi oculis videritis Insidids Miloni 4 Clddid factas, nec déprecatiiri sumus nec 
postulatiri (Mil. 6), unless you see with your own eyes the plots laid against 
Milo by Clodius, I shall neither beg nor demand, etc. 
non possum istum accisare, si cupiam (Verr. iv. 87), I cannot accuse him, if 
I should (so) desire. 
1It often depends entirely upon the view of the writer at the moment, and not 
upon the nature of the condition, whether it shall be stated vividly or not; as in the 
proverbial ‘If the sky falls, we shall catch larks” the impossible condition is iron- 
ically put in the vivid form, to illustrate the absurdity of some other supposed condi- 
tion stated by some one else. 
   
-P-A-G-E-340
  328 SYNTAX :—CONDITIONAL SENTENCES [§$ 516, 517° 
e. Rarely the Perfect Indicative is used in apodosis with a Pres- 
ent or even a Future (or Future Perfect) in protasis, to represent the 
conclusion rhetorically as already accomplished :— 
si hoc bene fixum in animé est, vicistis (Liv. xxi. 44), if this is well fixed in 
your minds, you have conquered. [For you will have conquered. ] 
si eundem [animum] habueritis, vicimus (id. xxi. 43), if you shall have kept 
the same spirit, we have conquered. 
f. A future condition is frequently thrown back into past time, 
without implying that it is contrary to fact (§ 517). In such cases 
the Imperfect or Pluperfect Subjunctive may be used : — 
ndn poterat, nisi décertare vellet (B. C. iii. 44), he was not able, unless he 
wished to fight. 
tumulus apparuit, . .. si lice palam irétur hostis praeventiirus erat (Liv. 
xxii. 24), a hill appeared. . . if they should go openly by daylight, the 
enemy would prevent. [The first two appear like Indirect Discourse, 
but are not. An observer describing the situation in the first example 
as present would say non potest nisi velit (see d), and no indirect dis- 
course would be thought of.] 
Caesar si peteret,. . . ndn quicquam proficeret (Hor. S. i. 3. 4), if even Cesar 
were to ask, he would gain nothing. [Here the construction is not con- 
trary to fact, but is simply si petat, non proficiat, thrown into past time.] 
Conditions Contrary to Fact 
517. In the statement of a supposition impliedly false, the Im- 
perfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive are used in both protasis and 
apodosis.!_ The Imperfect refers to present time, the Pluperfect 
to past: — > 
si viveret, verba éius audirétis (Rosc. Com. 42), if he were living, you would 
hear his words. [Present.] 
nisi tii Amisissés, numquam recépissem (Cat. M. 11), unless you had lost it, I 
should not have recovered it. [Past.] 
si meum cOnsilium valuisset, tii hodié egérés, rés piiblica ndn tot ducés ami- 
sisset (Phil. fi. 37), if my judgment had prevailed [as it did not], you 
would this day be a beggar, and the republic would not have lost so many 
leaders. [Mixed Present and Past.] 
1The implication of falsity, in this construction, is not inherent in the subjunc- 
tive; but comes from the transfer of a future condition to past time. Thus the time 
for the happening of the condition has, at the moment of writing, already passed; so 
that, if the condition remains a condition, it must be contrary to fact. So past forms 
of the indicative implying a future frequently take the place of the subjunctive in 
apodosis in this construction (see c, d, below, and § 511).
-P-A-G-E-341
  § 517] CONDITIONS CONTRARY TO FACT 329 
a. In conditions contrary to fact the Imperfect often refers to past 
time, both in protasis and apodosis, especially when a repeated or con- 
tinued action is denoted, or when the condition if true would still ewist : 
si nihil litteris adiuvarentur, numquam sé ad eadrum studium contulissent 
(Arch. 16), if they had not been helped at all by literature, they never 
would have given their attention to the study of it. [Without the condi- 
tion, adiuvabantur. ] 
hic si mentis esset suae, ausus esset Ediicere exercitum (Pison. 50), if he were 
of sane mind, would he have dared to lead out the army? [Here esset 
denotes a continued state, past as well as present. ] 
non concidissent, nisi illud receptaculum classibus nostris patéret (Verr. ii. 
8), [the power of Carthage] would not have fallen, unless that station had 
been [constantly] open to our fleets. [Without the condition, patébat.] 
b. In the apodosis of a condition contrary to fact the past tenses 
of the Indicative may be used to express what was intended, or likely, 
or already begun. In this use, the Imperfect Indicative corresponds 
in time to the Imperfect Subjunctive, and the Perfect or Pluperfect 
Indicative to the Pluperfect Subjunctive : — 
si licitum esset, matrés veniébant (Verr. v. 129), the mothers were coming if 
it had been allowed. 
in amplexis filiae ruébat, nisi lictorés obstitissent (Tac. Ann. xvi. 32), he was 
about rushing into his daughter’s arms, unless the lictors had opposed. 
iam tiita tenébam, ni géns criidélis ferrd invasisset (Aen. vi. 358), I was just 
reaching a place of safety, had not the fierce people attacked me. 
Nore 1.— Here the apodosis may be regarded as elliptical. Thus,— matrés venié- 
bant (et vénissent), the matrons were coming (and would have kept on) 7, ete. 
Norte 2.— With paene (and sometimes prope), almost, the Perfect Indicative is used 
in the apodosis of a past condition contrary to fact: as,— pons iter paene hostibus 
dedit, ni inus vir fuisset (Liv. ii. 10), the bridge had almost given a passage to the 
foe, if it had not been for one hero. 
e. Verbs and other expressions denoting necessity, propriety, possi- 
bility, duty, when used in the apodosis of a condition contrary to 
fact, may be put in the Imperfect or Perfect Indicative. 
Such are oportet, decet, débed, possum, necesse est, opus est, and the Sec- 
ond Periphrastic Conjugation: —1 
non potuit fieri sapiéns, nisi natus esset (Fin. ii. 103), he could not have become 
a sage, if he had not been born. 
si privdtus esset hdc tempore, tamen is erat déligendus (Manil. 50), if he were 
at this time a private citizen, yet he ought to be appointed. 
1 Observe that all these expressions contain the idea of futurity (cf. p. 328, footnote). 
Thus, decet mé [hodié] ire cris, means it is proper for me [to-day] to go to-morrow ; 
and, dec&bat mé [heri] ire hodié, it was proper for me [yesterday] to go to-day, usually 
with the implication that I have not gone as I was bound to do.

quod esse caput débébat, si probari posset (Fin. iv. 23), what ought to be the 
main point, if it could be proved. 
si ita putasset, certé optabilius Miloni fuit (Mil. 31), if he had thought so, surely 
it would have been preferable for Milo. 
Nore 1.—In Present conditions the Imperfect Subjunctive (oportéret, possem, etc.) 
is the rule, the Indicative being rare; in Past conditions both the Subjunctive (usually 
Pluperfect) and the Indicative (usually Perfect) are common. 
For par erat, melius fuit, and the like, followed by the infinitive, see § 521. n. 
Nore 2.—The indicative construction is carried still further in poetry 5, — ST 
non alium iactaret oddrem, laurus erat (Georg. ii. 133), i¢ were a laurel, but for giving 
out a different odor. 
  d. The participle in -irus with eram or fui may take the place of 
an Imperfect or Pluperfect Subjunctive in the apodosis of a condi- 
tion contrary to fact :— 
quid enim futirum fuit [= fuisset], si. . . (Liv. ii. 1), what would have hap- 
pened if, etc. 
relictiiri agrés erant, nisi ad eds Metellus litteras misisset (Verr. iii. 121), they 
would have abandoned their fields, if Metellus had not sent them a letter. 
neque ambigitur quin . . . id factirus fuerit, si. . . (Liv. ii. 1), nor is there 
any question that he would have done it, if, etc. [Direct: fécisset.] 
aded parata séditid fuit ut Othdnem raptiri fuerint, ni incerta noctis timuis- 
sent (Tac. H. i. 26), so far advanced was the conspiracy that they would 
have seized upon Otho, had they not feared the hazards of the night. [In 
a main clause: rapuissent, ni timuissent.] 
e. The Present Subjunctive is sometimes used in poetry in the 
protasis and apodosis of conditions contrary to fact : — 
ni comes admoneat, inruat (Aen. vi. 293), had not his companion warned him, 
he would have rushed on. [Cf. tii si hic sis, aliter sentias (Ter. And. 310), 
if you were in my place, you would think differently.] 
Nor 1.—This is probably a remnant of an old construction (see next note). 
Norr 2.—In old Latin the Present Subjunctive (as well as the Imperfect) is used 
in present conditions contrary to fact and the Imperfect (more rarely the Pluperfect) 
in past conditions of the same kind. Thus it appears that the Imperfect Subjunctive, 
like the Imperfect Indicative, once denoted past time, even in conditional sentences. 
Gradually, however, in conditional sentences, the Present Subjunctive was restricted 
to the less vivid future and the Imperfect (in the main) to the present contrary to fact, 
while the Pluperfect was used in past conditions of this nature. The old construction, 
however, seems to have been retained as an archaism in poetry. 
f. In Plautus and Terence absque mé (té, etc.) is sometimes used to 
introduce conditions contrary to fact: — 
absque té esset, hodié nusquam viverem (Pl. Men. 1022), if it were not for 
you, I should not be alive to-day. 
absque €6 esset, récté ego mihi vidissem (Ter. Ph. 188), if it had not been for 
him, I should have looked out for myself.

§ 518] GENERAL CONDITIONS 331 
GENERAL CONDITIONS 
518. General Conditions (§ 513. 2) have usually the same forms 
as Particular Conditions. But they are sometimes distinguished 
in the following cases : — 
a, The Subjunctive is often used in the second person singular, to 
denote the act of an indefinite subject (yow = any one). Here the 
Present Indicative of a general truth may stand in the apodosis : — 
vita hiimana prope uti ferrum est: si exerceds, conteritur ; si ndn exerceas, 
tamen robigo interficit (Cato de M.), human life is very like iron: if 
you use it, it wears away; if you don’t use it, rust still destroys it. 
virtiitem necessarid gloria, etiamsi ti id ndn agas, consequitur (Tusc. i. 91), 
glory necessarily follows virtue, even if that is not one’s aim. 
si prohibita imptine transcenderis, neque metus ultra neque pudor est (Tac. 
Ann. iii. 54), if you once overstep the bounds with impunity, there is no 
Sear or shame any more. 
b. In a general condition in present time, the protasis often takes 
the Perfect Indicative, and the apodosis the Present Indicative. For 
past time, the Pluperfect is used in the protasis, and the Imperfect in 
the apodosis : — 
si quis aliqua parte membrorum iniitilis notavérunt, necari iubent (Q. C. ix. 
1. 25), # they [ever] mark any infirm in any part of their limbs, they 
[always] order them to be put to death. [Present.] 
si & persequends hostis déterrére nequiverant, ab tergé circumveniébant (Iug. 
50), if [ever] they were unable to prevent the enemy from pursuing, they 
[always] surrounded them in the rear. [Past.] 
ce. In later writers (rarely in Cicero and Cesar), the Imperfect and 
Pluperfect Subjunctive are used in protasis, with the Imperfect In- 
dicative in apodosis, to state a repeated or customary action in past 
time (Iterative Subjunctive):— 
si quis 4 domin6 prehenderétur, concursi militum éripiébatur (B. C. iii. 110), 
if any (runaway) was arrested by his master, he was (always) rescued by 
a mob of soldiers. 
acciisitorés, si facultas incideret, poenis adficiébantur (Tac. Ann. vi. 30), the 
accusers, whenever opportunity offered, were visited with punishment. 
sI quis collégam appellasset, ab ed ita discédébat ut paenitéret non pridris 
décrét stetisse (Liv. iii. 86. 8), if any one appealed to a colleague, he 
[always] came off in such case that he repented not having submitted to 
the decree of the former decemvir. ([Cf. Sdcratés, quam sé cumque in 
partem dedisset, omnium fuit facile princeps (De Or. iii. 60), in whatever 
direction Socrates turned himself, he was (always) easily the foremost (if 
in any, etc.).]

Conditional Relative Clauses 
519. A clause introduced by a Relative Pronoun or Relative 
Adverb may express a condition and take any of the construc- 
tions of Protasis! (§ 514): — 
qui enim vitiis modum adponit, is partem suscipit vitisrum (Tusc. iv. 42), he 
who [only] sets a limit to faults, takes up the side of the faults. [= si 
quis adponit. Present, nothing implied. ] 
qui mentiri solet, péierare cOnsuévit (Rose. Com. 46), whoever is in the habit of 
lying, is accustomed to swear falsely. [= siquis solet. Present, nothing 
implied. ] 
quicquid potuit, potuit ipsa per sé (Leg. Agr. i. 20), whatever power she had, 
she had by herself. [= si quid potuit. Past, nothing implied. ] 
quod qui faciet, ndn aegritiidine sdlum vacabit, sed, etc. (Tusc. iv. 38), and 
he who does (shall do) this, will be free not only, etc. [= si quis faciet. 
Future, more vivid.] 
quisquis hiic vénerit, vapulabit (Pl. Am. 309), whoever comes here shall get a 
thrashing. [= si quis vénerit. Future, more vivid.] 
qué volés, sequar (Clu. 71), whithersoever you wish (shall wish), I will follow. 
[= si qué volés. Future, more vivid.] 
philosophia, cui qui pareat,omne tempus aetatissine molestia possit dégere(Cat. 
M. 2), philosophy, which if any one should obey, he would be able to spend 
his whole life without vexation. [= si quis pareat. Future, less vivid.] 
quaecumque vos causa hic attulisset, laetdrer (De Or. ii. 15), I should be glad, 
whatever cause had brought you here (i.e. if any other, as well as the one 
which did). [=si... attulisset. Contrary to fact.] 
The relative in this construction is always indefinite in meaning, 
and very often in form. 
520. The special constructions of General Conditions are some- 
times found in Conditional Relative Clauses : — 
1. The Second Person Singular of the Subjunctive in the protasis 
with the Indicative of a general truth in the apodosis (§ 518. a): — 
bonus tantum modo ségnior fit ubi neglegas, at malus improbior (Iug. 81. 28), 
a@ good man merely becomes less diligent when you don’t watch him, but a 
bad man becomes more shameless. [Present General Condition.] 
2. The Perfect or Pluperfect Indicative in the protasis and the 
Present or Imperfect Indicative in the apodosis (§ 518. 6): — 
cum hic véni, hdc ipsum nihil agere mé délectat (De Or. ii. 24), whenever I 
come here, this very doing nothing delights me (whenever I have come, 
ete.). [Present General Condition. ] 
1 As in the Greek ds ay, Sray, etc.; and in statutes in English, where the phrases 
if any person shall and whoever shall are used indifferently.

  §§ 520, 521] CONDITION DISGUISED 333 
cum rosam viderat, tum incipere vér arbitrabatur (Verr. v. 27), whenever he 
saw (had seen) a rose, then he thought spring was beginning. [Past 
General Condition. ] 
8. In later writers (rarely in Cicero and Cesar) the Imperfect, or 
Piuperfect Subjunctive in the protasis and the Imperfect Indicative 
in the apodosis (§ 518. ¢): — 
ubi imbécillités materiae postulare vidérétur, pilae interpdnuntur (B. C. ii. 
16), wherever the weakness of the timber seemed to require, piles were put 
between. [Past General Condition: interpdnuntur = interponébantur. ] 
quicumque sé intulisset, victériam sécum trahébat (Liv. vi. 8), wherever he 
advanced, he carried victory with him. [Past General Condition. ] 
Condition Disguised 
521. In many sentences properly conditional, the Protasis is 
not expressed by a conditional clause, but is stated in some other 
form of words or implied in the nature of the thought. 
a. The condition may be implied in a Clause, or in a Participle, 
Noun, Adverb, or some other word or phrase : — 
facile mé paterer —ill6 ipso itidice quaerente — prd Sex. Roscid dicere (Rose. 
Am. 85), I should readily allow myself to speak for Roscius if that very 
judge were conducting the trial. [Present contrary to fact: si quaereret, 
paterer. ]

come into my mind unless [I had been] reminded. [Past contrary to 
fact: nisi admonitus essem. ]

other people that would not have been crushed by such a weight of disaster. 
[Past contrary to fact: si alia fuisset.] 
némd umquam sine magna spé immortalitatis sé pro patria offerret ad mortem 
(Tuse. i. 32), no one, without great hope of immortality, would ever expose 
himself to death for his country. [Present contrary to fact : nisi magnam

could the addition of afew years have done him (if they had been added) ? 
[Past contrary to fact: si accessissent.] 
quid igitur mihi ferarum laniatus oberit nihil sentienti (Tusc. i. 104), what 
harm will the mangling by wild beasts do me if I don’t feel anything 
(feeling nothing)? [Future more vivid: si nihil sentiam.] 
incitita semel proclivi labuntur sustinérique nilld modé possunt (id. iv. 42), 
af once given-a push, they slide down rapidly and can in no way be 
checked. [Present General: si incitata sunt. ]

Norn. —In several phrases denoting necessity, propriety, or the like, the Imper- 
fect, Perfect, or Pluperfect Indicative of esse is used in the apodosis of a condition 
contrary to fact, the protasis being implied in a subject infinitive (cf. 517. ¢) :— 
quanto melius fuerat promissum non esse servatum (Off. iii. 94), how much better 
would it have been if the promise had not been kept! [promissum. .. 
servatum ==si proOmissum ndn esset servatum.] 
mori praeclarum fuit (Att. viii. 2. 2), it would have been honorable to die. 
sed erat aequius Triarium aliquid dé dissénsidne nostra itidicare (Fin. ii. 119), but it 
would be more equitable if Triarius passed judgment on our dispute. [Tri- 
arium iidicire=si Triarius itidicaret.] 
satius fuit Amittere milités (Inv. 3), it would have been better to lose the soldiers. 
[amittere =si amisisset.] 
  b. The condition may be contained in a wish (Optative Suljunctive), 
or expressed as an exhortation or command (Hortatory Suljunctive 
or Imperative) : — 
utinam quidem fuissem! molestus nobis nin esset (Fam. xii. 38), I wish I 
had been [chief]: he would not now be troubling us (i.e. if I had been). 
[Optative Subjunctive.] 
natiiram expellas furcd, tamen fisque recurret (Hor. Ep. i. 10. 24), drive out 
nature with a pitchfork, still she will ever return. [Hortatory.] 
rogés enim Aristénem, neget (Fin. iv. 69), for ask Aristo, he would deny. 
manent ingenia senibus, modo permaneat studium et industria (Cat. M. 22), 
old men keep their mental powers, only let them keep their zeal and dili- 
gence (§ 528. .). [Hortatory.] 
tolle hanc opinidnem, liictum sustuleris (Tusce. i. 30), remove this notion, and 
you will have done away with grief. [Imperative.] 
Nore. —The so-called Concessive Subjunctive with ut and né often has the force 
of protasis (§ 527. a. N.): as,—ut enim ratidnem Platé niillam adferret, ipsa auctoritate 
mé frangeret (Tusc. i. 49), even if Plato gave no reasons, [still] he would overpower 
me by his mere authority. 
c. Rarely the condition takes the form of an independent clause: 
ridés: maidre cachinné concutitur (Iuv. iii. 100), you laugh; he shakes with 
louder laughter (= if you laugh, he shakes). 
commové: sentiés (Tusc. iv. 54), stir him up, [and] you'll find, etc. 
dé paupertate agitur: multi patientés pauperés commemorantur (id. iii. 57), 
we speak of poverty; many patient poor are mentioned.

Condition Omitted 
522. The Protasis is often wholly omitted, but may be inferred 
from the course of the argument : — 
poterat Sextilius impiiné negare: quis enim redargueret (Fin. ii. 55), Seatilius 
might have denied with impunity; for who would prove him wrong (if he 
had denied)?

§§ 522, 523] COMPLEX CONDITIONS 335 
a, In expressions signifying necessity, propriety, and the like, the 
Indicative may be used in the apodosis of implied conditions, either 
future or contrary to fact: — 
quod contra decuit ab ills meum [corpus cremari] (Cat. M. 84), whereas on 
the other hand mine ought to have been burnt by him. 
nam nés decébat domum ligére ubi esset aliquis in licem éditus (Tusc. i. 
115), for it were fitting for us to mourn the house where a man has been 
born (but we do not). 
quant6 melius fuerat (Off. iii. 94), how much better it would have been. 
illud erat aptius, aequum cuique concédere (Fin. iv. 2), it would be more fit- 
ting to yield each one his rights. 
ipsum enim exspectare magnum fuit (Phil. ii. 103), would it have been a great 
matter to wait for the man himself? 
longum est ea dicere, sed . . . (Sest. 12), if would be tedious to tell, ete. 
[Future.] 
Nore 1.—In this construction, the Imperfect Indicative refers to present time; 
the Pluperfect to simple past time, like the Perfect. Thus oportébat means it ought 
to be [now], but is not; oportuerat means it ought to have been, but was not. 
Nore 2.—In many cases it is impossible to say whether a protasis was present 
to the mind of the speaker or not (see third example above). ~ 
Complex Conditions 
523. Either the Protasis or the Apodosis may be a complex idea 
in which the main statement is made with expressed or implied 
qualifications. In such cases the true logical relation of the 
parts is sometimes disguised : — 
si quis horum dixisset . . . si verbum dé ré piiblica fécisset .. . multa plira 
dixisse quam dixisset putarétur (Rose. Am. 2), ¢f any of these had spoken, 
in case he had said a word about politics he would be thought to have said 
much more than he did say. [Here the apodosis of dixisset is the whole 
of the following statement (si. . . putarétur), which is itself conditioned 
by a protasis of its own: si verbum, etc. ]. 
quod si in hdc mundi fieri sine ded non potest, né in sphaera quidem edsdem 
mOtis sine divind ingenid potuisset imitari (Tuse. i. 63), now if that can- 
not be done in this universe without divine agency, no more could [Archi- 
medes] in his orrery have imitated the same revolutions without divine 
genius. [Here si potest (a protasis with nothing implied) has for its 
apodosis the whole clause which follows, but potuisset has a contrary- 
to-fact protasis of its own implied in sine . . . ingenid.] 
peream male si non optimum erat (Hor. S. ii. 1. 6), confound me (may I 
perish wretchedly) if it would n’t be better. [Here peream is apodosis to 
the rest of the sentence, while the true protasis to optimum erat, contrary 
to fact, is omitted.]

  336 SYNTAX: CONDITIONAL SENTENCES [§ 524 
Clauses of Comparison (Conclusion Omitted) 
524, Conditional Clauses of Comparison take the Subjunctive, 
usually in the Present or Perfect unless the sequence of tenses 
requires the Imperfect or Pluperfect. 
Such clauses are introduced by the comparative particles tamquam, 
tamquam si, quasi, ac si, ut si, velut si (later velut), poetic ceu (all mean- 
ing as if), and by quam si (than if’): — 
tamquam clausa sit Asia (Fam. xii. 9), as if Asia were closed. 
tamquam si claudus sim (Pl. Asin. 427), just as if I were lame. 
ita his [hondrés] petunt, quasi honesté vixerint (Iug. 85), they seek them 
(offices) just as if they had lived honorably. 
quasi vér6 non specié visa iiidicentur (Acad. ii. 58), as if forsooth visible things 
were not judged by their appearance. 
similiter facis ac si mé rogés (N. D. iii. 8), you do exactly as if you asked me. 
criidélitétem horrérent velut si cram adesset (B. G. i. 82), they dreaded his 
cruelty (they said), as if he were present in person. 
hic ingentem pignam cernimus ceu cétera nusquam bella forent (Aen. ii. 438), 
here we saw a great battle, as if there were no fighting elsewhere. [But 
sometimes with the indicative in poetry, as id. v. 88.] 
magis 4 mé abesse vidébare quam si domi essés (Att. vi. 5), you seemed to 
be absent from me more than if you were at home. 
Note 1.—These subjunctive clauses are really future conditions with apodosis 
implied in the particle itself. Thus in tamquam si claudus sim the protasis is introduced 
by si, and the apodosis implied in tamquam, 
Norte 2.—The English idiom would lead us to expect the Imperfect and Pluperfect 
Subjunctive (contrary to fact) with these particles; but the point of view is different 
in the two languages. Thus the second example above is translated just as if I were 
lame, —as if it were a present condition contrary to fact; but it really means just as 
[it would be] if I should [at some future time] be lame, and so is a less vivid future 
condition requiring the Present Subjunctive. Similarly quasi honesté vixerint, as if 
they had lived honorably, is really as [they would do in the future] if they should have 
lived honorably and so requires the Perfect Subjunctive (§ 516. c). 
a, Even after a primary tense, the Imperfect or Pluperfect Sub- 
junctive (contrary to fact) is often used in conditional clauses of 
comparison : — 
aequé 4 té petd ac si mea negotia essent (Fam. xiii. 43), I entreat you as much 
as if it were my own business. 
éius negodtium sic velim suscipiiis ut si esset rés mea (id. vii. 20. 1), I would 
have you undertake his business as though it were my affair. 
Norr. — The practice differs with the different particles. Thus in Cicero a clause 
with tamquam or quasi almost always observes the sequence of tenses, but with quam si 
the Imperfect or Pluperfect is the rule.

  § 625] USE OF SI AND ITS COMPOUNDS 837 
Use of si and its Compounds 
525. The uses of some of the more common Conditional Parti- 
cles may be stated as follows : — 
a. Siis used for affirmative, nisi (ni) and si non for negative con- 
ditions. 
1. With nisi (generally unless) the apodosis is stated as universally true 
except in the single case supposed, in which case it is (impliedly) not true : — 
nisi Condn adest, maered, wnless Conon is here, I mourn (i.e. I am always in’ 
a state of grief except in the single case of Conon’s presence, in which 
case I am not). 
2, With sindn (if not) the apodosis is only stated as true in the (negative) 
case supposed, but as to other cases no statement is made : — 
si Conén non adest, maered, if Conon is not here, I mourn (i.e. I mourn in 
the single case of Conon’s absence, nothing being said as to other cases 
in which I may or may not mourn). 
Norxr.—It often makes no difference in which of these forms the condition is 
stated. 
8. Sometimes nisi si, except if, unless, occurs : — 
ndli putare mé ad quemquam longidrés epistulas scribere, nisi si quis ad mé 
plira scripsit (Fam. xiv. 2),... except in case one writes more to me. 
Norr. —Ni is an old form surviving in a few conventional phrases and reappear- 
ing in poets and later writers. 
6. Nisi vérd and nisi forte regularly introduce an objection or excep- 
tion ironically, and take the Indicative : — 
nisi vérd L. Caesar criidélior visus est (Cat. iv. 18), unless indeed Lucius 
Cesar seemed too cruel. 
nisi forte volumus Epiciirédrum opinidnem sequi (Fat. 37), unless, to be sure, 
we choose to follow the notion of the Epicureans. 
Nors. —This is the regular way of introducing a reductio ad absurdum in Latin. 
Nisi alone is sometimes used in this sense; as,—nisi imum hoc faciam ut in puted 
cénam coquant (Pl. Aul. 365), unless I do this one thing, [make them] cook dinner 
in the well. 
c. Sive (seu) .. . sive (seu), whether... or, introduce a condition 
in the form of an alternative. They may be used with any form of 
condition, or with different forms in the two members. Often also 
they are used without a verb: — 
nam illd locd libentissimé soled titi, sive quid mécum ipse cdgitd, sive quid 
scribd aut legd (Legg. ii. 1), for I enjoy myself most in that place, whether 
I am thinking by myself, or am either writing or reading. 
NotE.—Sive ... seu and seu. . . sive are late or poetic.

  838 SYNTAX: CONCESSIVE CLAUSES [$$ 525-527 
d, Sin, but ¢f, often introduces a supposition contrary to one that 
precedes : — 
acciisator illum défendet si poterit ; sin minus poterit, negabit (Inv. ii. 88), 
the accuser will defend him if he can ; but if he cannot, he will deny. 
e. Nisi is often used loosely by the comic poets in the sense of only 
when a negative (usually nescid) is expressed, or easily understood, in 
the main clause : — 
nescid: nisi mé dixisse némini cert6 scid (Ter. Ph. 952), I don’t know: only 
Iam sure that I haven't told anybody. 
CONCESSIVE CLAUSES 
526. The concessive idea is rather vague and general, and takes a variety of forms, 
each of which has its distinct history. Sometimes concession is expressed by the Hor- 
tatory Subjunctive in a sentence grammatically independent (§ 440), but it is more 
frequently and more precisely expressed by a dependent clause introduced by a con- 
cessive particle. The concessive force lies chiefly in the Conjunctions (which are 
indefinite or conditional in origin), and is often made clearer by an adversative par- 
ticle (tamen, certé) in the main clause. As the Subjunctive may be used in independ- 
ent clauses to express a concession, it is also employed in concessive clauses, and 
somewhat more frequently than the indicative. 
527. The Particles of Concession (meaning although, granting 
that) ave quamvis, ut, licet, etsi, tametsi, etiam si, quamquam, and cum. 
Some of these take the Subjunctive, others the Indicative, ac- 
cording to the nature of the clause which each introduces. 
a. Quamvis and ut take the Subjunctive : — 
quamvis ipsi infantés sint, tamen . . . (Or. 76), however incapable of speaking 
they themselves may be, yet, etc. 
quamvis scelerati illi fuissent (De Or. i. 230), however guilty they might have 
been. 
quamvis comis in amicis tuendis fuerit (Fin. ii. 80), amiable as he may have 
been in keeping his friends. 
ut néminem alium rogasset (Mil. 46), even if he had asked no other. 
ut enim n6n efficids quod vis, tamen mors ut malum non sit efficiés (Tuse. i. 
16), for even if you do not accomplish what you wish, still you will prove 
that death is not an evil. 
ut rationem Platd niillam adferret (id. i. 49), though Plato adduced no reasons. 
Norr. —Quamvis means literally as much as you will. Thus in the first example 
above, let them be as incapable as you will, still, etc. The subjunctive with quamvis 
is hortatory, like that with né (§ 440); that with ut (ut non) is of uncertain origin. 
b. Licet, although, takes the Present or Perfect Subjunctive : — 
licet omnés mihi terrdrés periculaque impendeant (osc. Am. 31), though ali 
terrors and perils should menace me.
-P-A-G-E-351
  § 527] CONCESSIVE CLAUSES 839 
Nore. — Licet is properly a verb in the present tense, meaning it is granted. Hence 
the subjunctive is by the sequence of tenses limited to the Present and Perfect. The 
consessive clause with licet is hortatory in origin, but may be regarded as a substan- 
tive clause serving as the subject of the impersonal verb (§ 565. N.1). 
c. Etsi, etiam si, tametsi, even if, take the same constructions as si 
(see § 514) : — 
etsi abest matiritas, tamen n6n est initile (Fam. vi. 18. 4), though ripeness 
of age is wanting, yet it is not useless, etc. 
etsi numquam dubium fuit, tamen perspicié (id. v. 19), although it has never 
been doubtful, yet I perceive, etc. 
etsi statueram (id. v. 5), though I had determined. 
etsi nihil aliud abstulissétis, tamen contentds vis esse oportébat (Sull. 90), 
even if you had taken away nothing else, you ought to have been satisfied. 
etiam si quod scribas non habébis, scribitd tamen (Fam. xvi. 26), even if you 
[shall] have nothing to write, still write. 
sed ea tametsi vos parvi pendébatis (Sall. Cat. 52. 9), but although you regarded 
those things as of small account. 
Nore 1.—Tametsi with the subjunctive is very rare. 
Norr 2.—A protasis with si often has a concessive force: as, — ego, si essent ini- 
micitiae mihi cum C. Caesare, tamen hic tempore rei piiblicae consulere .. . débérem 
(Proy. Cons. 47), as for me, even if I had private quarrels with Cxsar, it would still 
be my duty to serve the best interests of the state at this crisis. 
d. Quamquam, although, introduces an admitted fact and takes the 
Indicative : — 
omnibus — quamquam ruit ipse suis cladibus — pestem dénintiat (Phil. xiv. 
8), though he is breaking down under his disasters, still he threatens all 
with destruction. 
Nore. —Quamquam more eommonly means and yet, introducing a new proposition 
in the indicative: as, —quamquam haec quidem iam tolerabilia vidébantur, etsi, etc. 
(Mil. 76), and yet these, in truth, seemed now bearable, though, etc. 
e. The poets and later writers frequently use quamvis and quam- 
quam like etsi, connecting them with the Indicative or the Subjunc- 
tive, according to the nature of the condition : — 
quamquam movérétur (Liv. xxxvi. 34), although he was moved. 
Pollid amat nostram, quamvis est ristica, miisam (Ecl. iii. 84), Pollio loves 
my muse, though she is rustic. 
quamvis pervéneras (Liv. ii. 40), though you had come. 
f. Ut, as, with the Indicative, may be equivalent to a concession: 
yérum ut errare potuisti, sic décipi té ndn potuisse quis nén videt (Fam. x. 
20. 2), suppose you could have been mistaken, who does not see that you 
cannot have been deceived in this way ?

pressed by the Hortatory Subjunctive (negative né), see § 440.

  340 SYNTAX: CLAUSES OF PROVISO [S§ 528-581 
CLAUSES OF PROVISO 
528. Dum, modo, dummodo, and tantum ut, introducing a Proviso, 
take the Sohjaoiiye. The negative with these particles is né: 
6derint dum metuant (Off. i. 97), let them hate, if only they fear. 
valétiid6 modo bona sit (Brut. 64), provided the health be good. 
dummodo inter mé atque té miirus intersit (Cat. i. 10), provided only the wall 
(of the city) is between us. 
tantum ut sciant (Att. xvi. 11. 1), provided only they know. 
modo né sit ex pecudum genere (Off. i. 105), provided [in pleasure] he be 
not of the herd of cattle. 
id faciat saepe, dum né lassus fiat (Cato R. R. v. 4), let him do this often, 
provided he does not get tired. 
dummodo ea (sevéritis) né variétur (Q. Fr.i. 1. 20), provided only it (strictness) 
be not allowed to swerve. 
tantum né noceat (Ov. M. ix. 21), only let it do no harm. 
Norsr.— The Subjunctive with modo is hortatory or optative; that with dum and 
dummodo, a development from the use of the Subjunctive with dum in temporal clauses, 
§ 553 (compare the colloquial so long as my health is good, I don’t care). 
a. The Hortatory Subjunctive without a particle sometimes ex- 
presses a proviso : — 
sint Maecénatés, non deerunt Maronés (Mart. viii. 56. 5), so there be Mece- 
nases, Virgils will not be lacking. 
b. The Subjunctive with ut (negative né) is sometimes used to de- 
note a proviso, usually with ita in the main clause : — 
probata condici6 est, sed ita ut ille praesidia dédiiceret (Att. vii. 14. 1), the 
terms were approved, but only on condition that he should withdraw the 
garrisons. 
Norr.— This is a development of the construction of Characteristic or Result. 
For a clause of Characteristic expressing Proviso, see § 535. d. 
CLAUSES OF PURPOSE (FINAL CLAUSES) 
529. The Subjunctive in the clause of Purpose is hortatory in origin, coming 
through a kind of indirect discourse construction (for which see § 592). Thus, misit 
légatés qui dicerent means he sent ambassadors who should say, i.e. who were directed 
to say; in the direct orders the verb would be dicite, which would become dicant in the 
Indirect Discourse of narrative (§ 588) or dicerent in the past (cf. hortatory subjunctive 
in past tenses, § 439.6). The Subjunctive with ut and né is, in general, similar in 
origin. 
530. A clause expressing purpose is called a Final Clause. 
531. Final Clauses take the Subjunctive introduced by ut (uti), 
negative né (ut né), or by a Relative Pronoun or Adverb: — 
 
-P-A-G-E-353
  § 581] CLAUSES OF PURPOSE 841 
1. Pure Clauses of Purpose, with ut (uti) or né (ut né), express the 
purpose of the main verb in the form of a modifying clause: — 
ab aratrd abdiixérunt Cincinnatum, ut dictator esset (Fin. ii. 12), they brought 
Cincinnatus from the plough that he might be dictator. 
ut sint auxilid suis, subsistunt (B. C. i. 80), they halt in order to support (be 
an aid to) their own men. 
né milités oppidum inrumperent, portas obstruit (id: i. 27), he barricaded the 
gates, in order that the soldiers might not break into the town. 
scalas parari iubet, né quam facultaétem dimittat (id. i. 28), he orders scaling- 
ladders to be got ready, in order not to let slip any opportunity. 
ut né sit impiine (Mil. 31), that it be not with impunity. 
Nore 1.— Sometimes the conjunction has a correlative (ide6, idcircé, e6 consili6, etc.) 
in the main clause (ef. § 561. a): — 
légum idcircé servi sumus, ut liberi simus (Clu. 146), for this reason we are subject 
to the laws, that we may be free. 
copias transdixit ed cénsilid, ut castellum expignaret (cf. B. G. ii. 9), he led the 
troops across with this design —to storm the fort. 
Nork 2.— Ut ndn sometimes occurs in clauses of purpose when nén belongs to some 
particular word; as,—ut pliira non dicam (Manil. 44), to avoid unnecessary talk. 
2. Relative Clauses of Purpose are introduced by the relative pro- 
noun qui or a relative adverb (ubi, unde, qué, etc.). The antecedent 
is expressed or implied in the main clause: — 
mittitur L. Décidius Saxa qui loci natiram perspiciat (B. C. i. 66), Lucius 
Devidius Saxa is sent to eramine the ground (who should examine, etc.). 
scribébat dratidnés quas alii dicerent (Brut. 206), he wrote speeches for other 
men to deliver. 
e6 exstinctd fore unde discerem néminem (Cat. M. 12), that when he was dead 
there would be nobody from whom (whence) I could learn. 
huic né ubi consisteret quidem contra té locum reliquisti (Quinct. 73), you 
have left him no ground even to make a stand against you. 
habébam qué confugerem (Fam. iv. 6. 2), I had [a retreat] whither I might flee. 
Nor. —In this construction qui=ut is (etc.), ubi=ut ibi, and so on (§ 537. 2). 
a. The ablative qué (= ut ed) is used as a conjunction in final 
clauses which contain a comparative : — 
comprimere edrum audaciam, qué facilins céterdrum animi frangerentur 
(Fam. xv. 4. 10), to repress their audacity, that the spirit of the others 
might be broken more easily (by which the more easily). 
libertate tisus est, qué impinius dicdx esset (Quinct. 11), he took advantage 
of liberty, that he might bluster with more impunity. 
Nore. — Occasionally qué introduces a final clause that does not contain a compara- 
tive: as, —L. Sulla exercitum, qué sibi fidum faceret, lixuridsé habuerat (Sall. Cat. 11), 
Lucius Sulla had treated the army luxuriously, in order to make it devoted to him.

ete. ([Strictly, in order not to be tedious, I say we ordered.] 
sed ut ad Dionysium redeamus (Tusc. v. 63), but to return to Dionysius. 
sed ut eddem revertar, causa haec fuit timoris (Fam. vi. 7. 3), but, to return 
to the same point, this was the cause of fear. 
satis incdnsiderati fuit, né dicam audacis (Phil. xiii. 12), it was the act of one 
rash enough, not to say daring. 
Nore 1.—By a similar ellipsis the Subjunctive is used with nédum (sometimes né), 
still less, not to mention that : — 
' nédum salvi esse possimus (Clu. 95), much less could we be safe. 
Sar more will they hunt up at once some sort of crime and scandal. 
nédum in mari et via sit facile (Fam. xvi. 8), séill less is it easy at sea and ona 
Journey. 
quippe secundae rés sapientium animdés fatigant; né illi corruptis modribus vic- 
toriae temperarent (Sall. Cat. 11), for prosperity overmasters the soul even 
of the wise; much less did they with their corrupt morals put any check oh 
victory. 
Norte 2.— With nédum the verb itself is often omitted: as,—aptius himanitati 
tuae quam tdta Peloponnésus, nédum Patrae (Fam. vii. 28. 1), fitter for your refine- 
ment than all Peloponnesus, to say nothing of Patra. 
For Substantive Clauses involving purpose, see §§ 563-566. 
533. The Purpose of an action is expressed in Latin in various 
ways; but never (except in idiomatic expressions and rarely in 
poetry) by the simple Infinitive as in English (§ 460). 
The sentence, they came to seek peace, may be rendered — 
(1) vénérunt ut paicem peterent. [Final clause with ut (§ 531. 1).] 
(2) vénérunt qui pacem peterent. [Final clause with Relative (§ 531. 2).] 
(8) [vénérunt ad petendum pacem.] Not found with transitive verbs (§ 506, 
n.?), but cf. ad parendum senatui. [Gerund with ad (§ 506).] 
(4) vénérunt ad petendam pacem. [Gerundive with ad (§ 506).] 
(5) vénérunt pacem petendi causa (gratia). [Gen. of Gerund with causa 
(§ 504. b).] 
(6) vénérunt pacis petendae causa (gratia). [Gen. of Gerundive with causa 
(§ 504. b).] 
(7) vénérunt pacem petitiiri. [Future participle (§ 499. 2); in later writers. ] 
(8) vénérunt pacem petitum. [Supine in -um (§ 509).] 
These forms are not used indifferently, but —

unless the purpose is closely connected with some one word, in which 
ease a relative is more common: —

the English idiom, is nevertheless not harsh or strange. 
c. The Supine is used to express purpose only with verbs of motion, 
and in a few idiomatic expressions (§ 509). 
d. The Future Participle used to express purpose is a late con- 
struction of inferior authority (§ 499.2).

a sense approaching that of purpose, see § 490. 3. 
CLAUSES OF CHARACTERISTIC 
584. Tho relative clause of Characteristic with the Subjunctive is a development 
peculiar to Latin. A relative clause in the Indicative merely states something as a 
fact which is true of the antecedent; a characteristic clause (in the Subjunctive) 
defines the antecedent as a person or thing of such a character that the statement 
made is true of him or it and of all others belonging to the same class. Thus, —nén 
potest exercitum is continére imperator qui sé ipse non continet (indicative) means simply, 
that commander who does not (as a fact) restrain himself cannot restrain his army ; 
whereas non potest exercitum is-continére imperator qui sé ipse non contineat (subjunctive) 
would mean, that commander who is not such a man as to restrain himself, etc., 
that is, who is not characterized by self-restraint. 
This construction has its origin in the potential use of the subjunctive (§ 445). 
Thus, in the example just given, qui sé ipse ndn contineat would mean literally, who 
would not restrain himself (in any supposable case), and this potential idea passes 
over easily into that of general quality or characteristic. The characterizing force 
is most easily felt when the antecedent is indefinite or general. But this usage is 
extended in Latin to cases which differ but slightly from statements of fact, as in 
some of the examples below. 
The use of the Subjunctive to express Result comes from its use in Clauses of 
Characteristic. Thus, ndn sum ita hebes ut haec dicam means literally, J am not dull 
in the manner (degree) in which I should say this, hence, I am not so dull as to say 
this. Since, then, the characteristic often appears in the form of a supposed result, 
the construction readily passes over into Pure Result, with no idea of characteristic; 
as, —tantus in ciiria clamor factus est ut populus concurreret (Verr. ii. 47), such an outery 
was made in the senate-house that the people hurried together. 
535. A Relative Clause with the Subjunctive is often used to 
indicate a characteristic of the antecedent, especially where the 
antecedent is otherwise undefined : —

neque enim tii is es qui nescias (Fam. y. 12. 6), for you are not such a one as 
not to know. [Here is is equivalent to such, and is defined only by the 
relative clause that follows.] 
multa dicunt quae vix intellegam (Fin. iv. 2), they say many things which 
(such as) I hardly understand. 
paci quae nihil habitira sit insidiarum semper est cdnsulendum (Off. i. 35), 
we must always aim at a peace which shall have no plots. 
a, A Relative Clause of Characteristic is used after general expres- 
sions of ewistence or non-existence, including questions which imply 
a negative. : 
So especially with sunt qui, there are [some] who; quis est qui, who 
is there who? — 
sunt qui discessum animi 4 corpore putent esse mortem (Tusc. i. 18), there are 
some who think that the departure of soul from body constitutes death. 
erant qui cénsérent (B. C. ii. 80), there were some who were of the opinion, etc. 
erant qui Helvidium miserarentur (Tac. Ann. xvi. 29), there were some who 
pitied Helvidius. [Cf. est cum (n. °, below).] 
quis est qui id non maximis efferat laudibus (Lael. 24), who is there that does 
not extol it with the highest praise ? 
nihil vided quod timeam (Fam. ix. 16. 8), I see nothing to fear. 
nihil est quod adventum nostrum extiméscas (Fam. ix. 26. 4), there is no rea- 
son why you should dread my coming. 
unde agger comportari posset nihil erat reliquum (B. C. ii. 15), there was noth- 
ing left from which an embankment could be got together. 
Nore 1.— After general negatives like ném6 est qui, the Subjunctive is regular; 
after general affirmatives like sunt qui, it is the prevailing construction, but the Indic- 
ative sometimes occurs; after multi (ndn nilli, quidam) sunt qui, and similar expres- 
sions in which the antecedent is partially defined, the choice of mood depends on the 
shade of meaning which the writer wishes to express: — 
sunt béstiae quaedam in quibus inest aliquid simile virtiitis (Fin. y. 38), there are 
certain animals in which there is something like virtue. 
But, —inventi multi sunt qui vitam prdfundere pro patria parati essent (Off. i. 84), 
many were found of such a character as to be ready to give their lives for 
their country. 
Norr 2.—Characteristic clauses with sunt qui etc. are sometimes called Relative 
Clauses with an Indefinite Antecedent, but are to be carefully distinguished from the 
Indefinite Relative in protasis (§ 520). 
Nore 3.— The phrases est cum, fuit cum, etc. are used like est qui, sunt qui: as, — 
ac fuit cum mihi quoque initium requiéscendi fore itistum arbitrarer (De Or. i. 1), and 
there was a time when I thought a beginning of rest would be justifiable on my part.   
6. A Relative Clause of Characteristic may follow finus and sélus: 
nil admirari prope rés est tina sdlaque quae possit facere et servare beatum 
(Hor. Ep. i. 6. 1), to wonder at nothing is almost the sole and only thing 
that can make and keep one happy. 
sdlus es ciius in victdria ceciderit ném6 nisi armatus (Deiot. 34), you are the 
only man in whose victory no one has fallen unless armed.

  § 535] CLAUSES OF CHARACTERISTIC 845 
ec. A clause of Result or Characteristic with quam ut, quam qui 
(xarely with quam alone), may be used after comparatives : — 
Canachi signa rigididra sunt quam ut imitentur véritatem (Brut. 70), the statues 
of Canachus are too stiff to represent nature (stiffer than that they should). 
maidrés arborés caedébant quam quas ferre miles posset (Liv. xxxiii. 5), they cut 
trees too large for a soldier to carry (larger than what a soldier could carry). 
Nore. — This construction corresponds in sense to the English too. . . to. 
d, A relative clause of characteristic may express restriction or 
proviso (cf. § 528, b) : — 
quod sciam, so far as I know (lit. as to what I know). 
Catdnis dratidnés, quas quidem invénerim (Brut. 65), the speeches of Cato, at 
least such as I have discovered. 
seryus est ném6, qui modo tolerabili condicidne sit servitiitis (Cat. iv. 16), 
there is not a slave, at least in any tolerable condition of slavery. 
e. A Relative Clause of Characteristic may express cawse or conces- 
sion : — 
peccdsse mihi videor qui 4 té discesserim (Fam. xvi. 1), I seem to myself to 
have done wrong because I have left you. [Causal.] 
virum simplicem qui ns nihil célet (Or. 230), O guileless man, who hides noth- 
ing from us! [Causal.] 
egomet qui sérd Graecas litteras attigissem, tamen compliirés Athénis diés 
sum commoratus (De Or. i. 82), I myself, though I began Greek literature 
late, yet, etc. (lit. [a man] who, etc.). [Concessive.] 
Nore 1.—In this use the relative is equivalent to cum is etc. It is often preceded 
by ut, utpote, or quippe: — 
nec consul, ut qui id ipsum quaesisset, moram certamini fécit (Liv. xlii. 7), nor 
did the consul delay the fight, since he had sought that very thing (as [being 
one] who had sought, etc.). 
Licius, friter éius, utpote qui peregré dépignarit, familiam diicit (Phil. v. 30), 
Lucius, his brother, leads his household, inasmuch as he is a man who has 
Sought it out abroad. 
convivia cum patre ndn inibat, quippe qui né in oppidum quidem nisi perrard 
veniret (Rosc. Am. 52), he did not go to dinner parties with his father, since 
he did not even come to town except very rarely. 
Nors 2.—The Relative of Cause or Concession is merely a variety of the Charac- 
teristic construction. The quality expressed by the Subjunctive is connected with the 
action of the main verb either as cause on account of which (stnck) or as hindrance 
in spite of which (ALTHOUGH). 
f. Dignus, indignus, aptus, iddneus take a subjunctive clause with 
a relative (rarely ut). The negative is nén: — 
digna in quibus élaborarent (Tusc. i. 1), (things) worth spending their toil on 
(worthy on which they should, etc.). 
- digna rés est ubi tii nervds intendas tuds (Ter. Eun. 812), the affair is worthy 
of your stretching your sinews (worthy wherein you should, etc.).   a a a a i ek el ah
-P-A-G-E-358

iddneus qui impetret (Manil. 57), fit to obtain. 
indigni ut redimerémur (Liv. xxii. 59. 17), unworthy to be ransomed. 
Nore 1.— This construction is sometimes explained as a relative clause of purpose, 
but it is more closely related to characteristic. 
Nore 2. — With dignus etc., the poets often use the Infinitive: — 
fons rivd dare nomen idoneus (Hor. Ep. i. 16. 12), a source fit to give a name to a 
stream. 
aetas mollis et apta regi (Ov. A. A. i. 10), a time of life soft and easy to be guided. 
vivere dignus eras (Ov. M. x. 633), you were worthy to live. 
CLAUSES OF RESULT (CONSECUTIVE CLAUSES) 
536. The Subjunctive in Consecutive Clauses is a development of the use of that 
mood in Clauses of Characteristic (as explained in § 534). 
537. Clauses of Result take the Subjunctive introduced by ut, so 
that (negative, ut non), or by a relative pronoun or relative adverb. 
1. Pure Clauses of Result, with ut or ut non, express the result of 
the main verb in the form of a modifying clause: — 
tanta vis probitatis est ut eam in hoste diligamus (Lael. 29), so great is the 
power of goodness that we love it even in an enemy. 
pignatur acriter ad novissimum agmen, aded ut paene terga convertant 
(B. C. i. 80), there is sharp fighting in the rear, so (to such a degree) that 
they almost take flight. 
multa rimor adfingébat, ut paene bellum confectum vidérétur (id. i. 53), 
rumor added many false reports, so that the war seemed almost ended. 
2. Relative Clauses of Result are introduced by the relative pro- 
noun qui or a relative adverb (ubi, unde, qué, etc.). The antecedent is 
expressed or implied in the main clause. 
The Relative in this construction is equivalent to ut with the corre- 
sponding demonstrative: — qui = ut is (etc.), ubi = ut ibi, and so on: 
nam est innocentia affectis tilis animi quae noceat némini (Tusc. iii. 16), for 
innocence is such a quality of mind as to do harm to no one. 
sunt aliae causae quae plané efficiant (Top. 59), there are other causes such as 
to bring to pass. 
niilla est celeritas quae possit cum animi celeritate contendere (Tusc. i. 43), 
there is no swiftness which can compare with the swiftness of the mind. 
quis navigavit qui ndn sé mortis periculd committeret (Manil. 31), who went to 
sea who did not incur the peril of death ? 
Nore 1.— Since the relative clause of Result is a development from the relative 
clause of Characteristic (§ 534), no sharp line can be drawn between the two construc- 
tions. In doubtful cases, it is better to attempt no distinction or to describe the clause 
as one of Characteristic. 
Nore 2.— Clauses of Result are often introduced by such correlative words as tam, 
talis, tantus, ita, sic, aded, isque ed, which belong to the main clause.
-P-A-G-E-359
    
§§ 587, 588] CLAUSES OF RESULT 847 
a. A Negative Result is introduced by ut non, ut ném6, qui non, etc., 
not by né: — 
multis gravibusque volneribus confectus ut iam sé sustinére non posset (B. G. 
ii. 25), used up with many severe wounds so that he could no longer stand. 
tanta vi in Pompéi equités impetum fécérunt ut edrum némé consisteret (B. C. 
iii. 93), they attacked Pompey’s cavalry with such vigor that not one of 
them stood his ground. 
ném6 est tam senex qui sé annum nin putet posse vivere (Cat. M. 24), nobody 
is so old as not to think that he can live a year. 
Norr.— When the result implies an effect intended (not a simple purpose), ut né 
or né is sometimes used as being less positive than ut non :— [librum] ita corrigas né 
mihi noceat (Caecina, Fam. vi. 7. 6), correct the book so that it may not hurt me. 
b. Frequently a clause of result or characteristic is used in a re- 
strictive sense, and so amounts to a Proviso (cf. § 535. d): — 
hoc ita est titile ut né plané inlidamur ab acciisatoribus (Rosc. Am, 55), this 
is so far useful that we are not utterly mocked by the accusers (i.e. useful 
only on this condition, that, etc.). 
nihil autem est molestum quod ndn désiderés (Cat. M. 47), but nothing is 
troublesome which (= provided that) you do not miss. 
ce. The clause of result is sometimes expressed in English by the 
Infinitive with ro or so as To or an equivalent : — 
tam longé aberam ut non vidérem, I was too far away to see (so far that I 
did not see; cf. § 535. c). 
Norr. —Result is never expressed by the Infinitive in Latin except by the poets in 
a few passages (§ 461. a). 
538. The constructions of Purpose and Result are precisely 
alike in the affirmative (except sometimes in tense sequence, 
§ 485. c); but, in the negative, Purpose takes né, Result ut non 
etc. : — 
cistoditus est né effugeret, he was guarded in order that he micur not escape. 
cistdditus est ut non effugeret, he was guarded so that he pip not escape. 
So in negative Purpose clauses né quis, né quid, né illus, né qué, né 
quand6, nécubi, etc. are almost always used ; in negative Result clauses, 
ut ném6, ut nihil, ut niillus, etc.: — 
(1) cernere né quis eds, neu quis contingere posset (Aen. i. 413), that no one 
might see them, no one touch them. [Purpose.] 
né quandé liberis préscriptdrum bona patria reddantur (Rosc. Am. 145), lest 
at some time the patrimony of the proscribed should be restored to their 
children. 
ipse né qué inciderem, reverti Formias (Att. viii. 8. 7), that I might not come 
upon him anywhere, I returned to Formic.

For clauses of Result or Characteristic with quin, see §559. For Substantive Clauses 
of Result, see §§ 567-571. 
CAUSAL CLAUSES 
539. Causal Clauses take either the Indicative or the Subjunctive, according to 
their construction; the idea of cause being contained, not in the mood itself, but in 
the form of the argument (by implication), in an antecedent of causal meaning (like 
propterea), or in the connecting particles. 
Quod is in origin the relative pronoun (stem quo-) used adverbially in the accusative 
neuter (cf. § 214. d) and gradually sinking to the position of a colorless relative con- 
junction (cf. English that and see § 222). Its use as a causal particle is an early 
special development. Quia is perhaps an accusative plural neuter of the relative stem 
qui-, and seems to have developed its causal sense more distinctly than quod, and at 
an earlier period. It is used (very rarely) as an interrogative, why? (so in classical 
Latin with nam only), and may, like quand, have developed from an interrogative to 
a relative particle. 
Quoniam (for quom iam) is also of relative origin (quom being a case-form of the 
pronominal stem quo-). It occurs in old Latin in the sense of when (cf. quom, cum), 
from which the causal meaning is derived (cf. cum causal). The Subjunctive with quod 
and quia depends on the principle of Informal Indirect, Discourse (§ 592). 
Quandé is probably the interrogative quam (how ?) compounded with a form of the 
pronominal stem do- (cf. dum, dd-nec). It originally denoted time (first interrogatively, 
then as a relative), and thus came to signify cause. Unlike quod and quia, it is not 
used to state a reason in informal indirect discourse and therefore is never followed 
by the Subjunctive. 
540. The Causal Particles quod and quia take the Indicative, 
when the reason is given on the authority of the writer or 
speaker ; the Subjunctive, when the reason is given on the 
authority of another : — 
1. Indicative :— 
cum tibi agam gratids quod mé vivere coégisti (Att. iii. 3), when I may thank 
you that you have forced me to live. 
cir igitur picem ndld? quia turpis est (Phil. vii. 9), why then do I not wish 
Sor peace? Because it is disgraceful. 
ita fit ut adsint propterea quod officium sequuntur, taceant autem quia peri- 
culum vitant (Rose. Am. 1), so it happens that they attend because they 
follow duty, but are silent because they seek to avoid danger.
-P-A-G-E-361
  § 540] CAUSAL CLAUSES 349 
2. Subjunctive : — 
mihi gratulabare quod audissés mé meam pristinam dignitatem obtinére 
(Fam. iv. 14. 1), you congratulated me because [as you said] you had 
heard that I had regained my former dignity. 
noctii ambulabat Themistoclés quod somnum capere non posset (Tusc. iv. 44), 
Themistocles used to walk about at night because [as he said] he could not 
sleep. 
mea mater irata est quia ndn redierim (Pl. Cist. 101), my mother is angry 
because I didn’t return. 
Nore 1. — Quod introduces either a fact or a statement, and accordingly takes either 
the Indicative or the Subjunctive. Quia regularly introduces a fact; hence it rarely 
takes the Subjunctive. Quoniam, inasmuch as, since, when now, now that, has refer- 
ence to motives, excuses, justifications, and the like and takes the Indicative. 
Nore 2.— Under this head what the speaker himself thought under other cireum- 
stances may have the Subjunctive (§ 592. 3. N.): as,—ego laeta visa sum quia soror 
vénisset (Pl. Mil. 387), J seemed (in my dream) glad because my sister had come. 
So with quod even a verb of saying may be in the Subjunctive: as, —rediit quod 
sé oblitum nescid quid diceret (Off. i. 40), he returned because he said he had forgotten 
something. 
Nore 3.— Non quod, non quia, non qué, introducing a reason expressly to deny it, take 
the Subjunctive; but the Indicative sometimes occurs when the statement is in itself 
true, though not the ¢rue reason. In the negative, ndn quin (with the Subjunctive) 
may be used in nearly the same sense as ndn quod ndn. After a comparative, quam 
qué or quam quod is used : — 
pugilés ingeméscunt, ndn quod doleant, sed quia profundendi voce omne corpus 
intenditur (Tusce. ii. 56), bowers groan, not because they are in pain, but 
because by giving vent to the voice the whole body is put in a state of 
tension. ‘ 
non quia réctior ad Alpis via esset, sed crédéns (Liv. xxi. 31. 2), not because the 
route to the Alps was more direct, but believing, ete. 
ndn quin pari virtiite et voluntate alii fuerint, sed tantam causam non habuérunt 
(Phil. vii. 6), not that there were not others of equal courage and good-will, 
but they had not so strong a reason. 
haec amore magis impulsus scribenda ad té putiivi, quam qué té arbitrarer monitis 
et praeceptis egére (Fam. x. 3. 4), this I thought I ought to write to you, 
rather from the impulse of (prompted by) affection than because I thought 
that you needed advice and suggestion. 
a. Quoniam and quandd, since, introduce a reason given on the 
authority of the writer or speaker, and take the Indicative : — 
locus est 4 mé, quoniam ita Muréna voluit, retractandus (Mur. 54), I must 
review the point, since Murena has so wished. ~ 
quandé ita vis, di bene vyortant (Pl. Trin. 573), since you so wish, may the 
gods bless the undertaking. 
quandé ad maidra nati sumus (Fin. v. 21), since we are born for greater things. 
Norge. — The Subjunctive with quoniam js unclassical. Quandé, since, in the causal 
sense, is mostly archaic or late. Quand, when, is used as interrogative, relative, and 
indefinite: as, —quand6? hodié, when? to-day ; si quandé, if ever.

TEMPORAL CLAUSES 
541. Temporal Clauses are introduced by particles which are almost all of rela- 
tive origin. They are construed like other relative clauses, except where they have 
developed into special idiomatic constructions.! 
: For list of Temporal Particles, see p. 138. 
Temporal Clauses may be classified as follows: — 
I. Conditional Relative Clauses: ubi, ut, cum, quandé, in Protasis (§ 542). 
II. Clauses with postquam, ubi, etc. (Indicative), (§ 543). 
ql 1, Cum temporal (§§ 545-548).

IV. Clauses with antequam and priusquam (Indicative or Subjunctive) (§ 551). 
YV. Clauses with dum, donec, and quoad (Indicative or Subjunctive) (§§ 552-556). 
Conditional Relative Clauses 
542. The particles ubi, ut, cum, quandd, either alone or com- 
pounded with -cumque, may be used as Indefinite Relatives (in the 
sense of whenever), and have the constructions of Protasis (cf. 
§ 514): — cum id malum negas esse, capior (Tusc. ii. 29), whenever you (the indi- 
vidual disputant) deny it to be an evil, Iam misled. [Present general 
condition. ] 
quod profecté cum mé niilla vis cégeret, facere ndn audérem (Phil. v. 51), 
which I would surely not venture to do, as long as no force compelled me. 
[Present, contrary to fact: cf. § 517.] 
cum videds eds dolore non frangi, débeds existimare, etc. (Tusc. ii. 66), when 
: you see that those are not broken by pain, you ought to infer, ete. [Pres-

other principle of construction. (See Intermediate Clauses, § 591.)

Temporal Clauses with postqguant, ubi, etc. 
543. The particles postquam (postedquam), ubi, ut (ut primum, ut 
semel), simul atque (simul ac, or simul alone), take the Indicative 
usually in the perfect or the historical present): — 
milités postquam victdriam adepti sunt, nihil reliqui victis fécére (Sall. Cat. 11), 
when the soldiers had won the victory, they left nothing to the vanquished. 
postedquam forum attigisti, nihil fécisti nisi, etc. (Fam. xv. 16. 3), since you 
came to the forum, you have done nothing except, etc. 
ubi omnis idem sentire intelléxit, posterum diem piignae cdnstituit (B. G. 
iii. 23), when he understood that all agreed (thought the same thing), he 
appointed the next day for the battle. 
Catilina, ubi eds convénisse videt, sécédit (Sall. Cat. 20), when Catiline sees 
that they have come together, he retires. 
Pompéius ut equitatum suum pulsum vidit, acié excessit (B. C. iii. 94), when 
Pompey saw his cavalry beaten, he left the field. 
ut semel é Piraced éloquentia évecta est (Brut. 51), as soon as eloquence had 
set sail from the Pireus. 
nostri simul in drid6 cénstitérunt, in hostis impetum fécérunt (B. G. iv. 26), 
our men, as soon as they had taken a position on dry ground, made an 
attack on the enemy. 
simul atque intrdductus est, rem confécit (Clu. 40), as soon as he was brought 
in, he did the job. 
a. These particles less commonly take the Imperfect or Pluperfect 
Indicative. The Imperfect denotes a past state of things; the Plu- 
perfect, an action completed in past time : — 
postquam striicti utrimque stabant, ducés in medium précédunt (Liv. i. 
23), when they stood in array on both sides, the generals advance into 
the midst. 
P. Africdnus postedquam bis consul et cénsor fuerat (Caecil. 69), when Afri- 
canus had been (i.e. had the dignity of having been) twice consul and 
censor. 
postquam id difficilius visum est, neque facultas perficiendi dabatur, ad Pom- 
péium transiérunt (B. C. iii. 60), when this seemed too hard, and no means 
of effecting it were given, they passed over to Pompey. 
post diem quintum quam iterum barbari male pignaverant [= victi sunt], 
légati 4 Bocch6 veniunt (Iug. 102), the fifth day after the barbarians were 
beaten the second time, envoys come from Bocchus.

Usrs oF Cum 
544. The conjunction cum (quom) is a case-form of the relative pronoun qui. It 
inherits from qui its subordinating force, and in general shares its constructions. 
But it was early specialized to a temporal meaning (cf. tum, dum), and its range of usage 
was therefore less wide than that of qui; it could not, for example, introduce clauses 
of purpose or of result. 
With the Indicative, besides the simple expression of definite time (corresponding to 
simple relative clauses with the Indicative), it has a few special uses, — conditional, 
explicative, cum inversum—all easily derived from the temporal use. 
With the Subjunctive, cum had a development parallel to that of the qui-clause of 
Characteristic, —a development not less extensive and equally peculiar to Latin. 
From defining the time the cum-clause passed over to the description of the time by 
means of its attendant circumstances of cause or concession (cf. since, while). 
In particular, cum with the Subjunctive was used in narrative (hence the past 
tenses, Imperfect and Pluperfect) as a descriptive clause of time. As, however, the 
present participle in Latin is restricted in its use and the perfect active participle is 
almost wholly lacking, the historical or narrative cum-clause came into extensive use 
to supply the deficiency. In classical writers the narrative cum-clause (with the Sub- 
junctive) has pushed back the defining clause (with the Imperfect or Pluperfect Indica- 
tive) into comparative infrequency, and is itself freely used where the descriptive or 
characterizing force is scarcely perceptible (cf. the qui-clause of Characteristic, § 534). 
Cum Temporal 
545. A temporal clause with cum, when, and some past tense of 
the Indicative dates or defines the time at which the action of the 
main verb occurred : — 
ed [litud] regidnés diréxit tum cum urbem condidit (Div. i. 30), he traced with 
it the quarters [of the sky] at the time he founded the city. 
cum occiditur Sex. Roscius, ibidem fuérunt servi (Rose. Am. 120), when 
Roscius was slain, the slaves were on the spot. [occiditur is historical 
present. ] 3 
quem quidem cum ex urbe pellébam, hdc prdvidébam animé (Cat. iii. 16), 
when I was trying to force him (conative imperfect) from the city, I 
looked forward to this. 
fulgentis gladids hostium vidébant Decii cum in aciem edrum inruébant (Tuse. 
li. 59), the Decit saw the flashing swords of the enemy when they rushed 
upon their line.

when many had lost great fortunes in Asia. 
Nore 1.— This is the regular use with all tenses in early Latin, and at all times 
with the Perfect and the Historical Present (as with postquam etc.). With the Imper- 
fect and Pluperfect the Indicative use is (in classical Latin) much less common than 
the Subjunctive use defined below (§ 546). 
Nort 2.—This construction must not be confused with that of cum, whenever, in 
General Conditions (§ 542).
-P-A-G-E-365
  § 545, 546] CUM TEMPORAL 858 
a. When the time of the main clause and that of the temporal 
clause are absolutely identical, cum takes the Indicative in the same 
tense as that of the main verb: 
maxima sum laetitia adfectus cum audivi consulem té factum esse (Fam. 
xy. 7), I was very much pleased when I heard that you had been elected 
consul.   
546. A temporal clause with cum and the Imperfect or Pluper- 
fect Subjunctive describes the cirewmstances that accompanied or 
preceded the action of the main verb: — 
cum essem Otidsus in Tusculan6, accépi tuas litters (Fam. ix. 18. 1), when I 
was taking my ease in my house at Tusculum, I received your letter. 
cum servili bell premerétur (Manil. 30), when she (Italy) was under the load 
of the Servile War. 
cum id niintiatum esset, matiirat (B. G. i. 7), when this had been reported, he 
made (makes) haste. 
cum ad Cybistra quinque diés essem moratus, régem Ariobarzanem insidiis 
liberavi (Fam. xv. 4. 6), after remaining at Cybistra for five days, I freed 
King Ariobarzanes from plots. 
is cum ad mé Laodicéam vénisset mécumque ego eum vellem, repente per- 
cussus est atrdcissimis litteris (id. ix. 25. 8), when he had come to me at 
Laodicea and I wished him to remain with me, he was suddenly, etc. 
Nore 1.—This construction is very common in narrative, and cum in this use is often 
called narrative cum, 
Nore 2.— Cum with the Imperfect or Pluperfect Indicative does not (like cum with 
the Imperfect or Pluperfect Subjunctive) describe the time by its cirewmstances; it 
defines the time of the main verb by denoting a coéxistent state of things (Imperfect 
Indicative) or a result attained when the action of the main verb took place (Pluper- 
fect). Thus the construction is precisely that of postquam etc. (§ 543. a). 
Nore 3.—The distinction between the uses defined in §§ 545, 546, may be illustrated 
by the following examples: (1) He had a fever when he was in Spain (Shakspere). 
Here the when-clause defines the time when Cesar had the fever, —namely, in the year , 
of his Spanish campaign (s.c. 49). In Latin we should use cum with the Imperfect 
Indicative. (2) Columbus discovered America when he was seeking a new route to 
India; here the when-clause does not define or date the time of the discovery; it 
merely describes the circumstances under which America was discovered,—namely, 
in the course of a voyage undertaken for another purpose. In Latin we should use the 
Imperfect Subjunctive. 
Nor 4.—The distinction explained in Note 3 is unknown to early Latin. In 
Plautus quom always has the Indicative unless the Subjunctive is required for some 
other reason. 
a. When the principal action is expressed in the form of a tem- 
poral clause with cum, and the definition of the time becomes the 
main clause, cum takes the Indicative. 
Here the logical relations of the two clauses are inverted; hence 
cum is in this use called cum inversum : —

digs nOndum decem intercesserant, cum ille alter filius infans necdtur (Clu. 
28), ten days had not yet passed, when the other infant son was killed. 
[Instead of when ten days had not yet passed, etc. ] 
iamque lix apparébat cum procédit ad milités (Q. C. vii. 8. 3), and day was 
already dawning when he appears before the soldiers. 
hoc facere noctii apparabant, cum matrés familiae repente in piblicum pro- 
currérunt (B. G. vii. 26), they were preparing to do this by night, when the 
women suddenly ran out into the streets. 
  547. Present time with cum temporal is denoted by the Pres- 
ent Indicative; future time, by the Future or Future Perfect 
Indicative : — 
incidunt tempora, cum ea, quae maximé videntur digna esse iiistd homine, 
fiunt contraria (Off. i. 31), times occur when those things which seem 
especially worthy of the upright man, become the opposite. 
non dubitabé dare operam ut té videam, cum id satis commodé facere poterd 
(Fam. xiii. 1), I shall not hesitate to take pains to see you, when I can do 
it conveniently. 
longum jllud tempus cum non erd (Att. xii. 18), that long time when I shall 
be no more. 
cum véneris, cOgndscés (Fam. y. 7. 3), when you come (shall have come), 
you will find out. 
548. Cum, whenever, takes the construction of a relative clause 
in a general condition (see § 542). 
For present time, either the Present or the Perfect Indicative is 
used; for past time, regularly the Pluperfect Indicative. 
For est cum etc., see § 535. a. N. 8. 
Cum Causal or Concessive 
  
549. Cum causal or concessive takes the Subjunctive: 
id difficile nin est, cum tantum equitati valeamus (B. C. iii. 86), this is not 
difficult since we are so strong in cavalry. [Causal.] 
cum sdlitiidd insidiarum et metiis pléna sit, ratio ipsa monet amicitias com- 
parare (Fin. i. 66), since solitude is full of treachery and fear, reason it- 
self prompts us to contract friendships. [Causal.] 
cum primi drdinés concidissent, tamen acerrimé reliqui resistébant (B. G. 
vii. 62), though the first ranks had fallen, still the others resisted vigor- 
ously. [Concessive.] 
brevi spatis legisnés numerd hominum expléverat, cum initié non amplius 
dudbus milibus habuisset (Sall. Cat. 56), in a short time he had filled 
out the legions with their complement of men, though at the start he had 
not had more than two thousand, [Concessive.]    
-P-A-G-E-367
  §§ 549-551] ANTEQUAM AND PRIUSQUAM 855 
Cum causal may usually be translated by since ; cum concessive by 
although or while; either, occasionally, by when. 
Norts 1.— Cum in these uses is often emphasized by ut, utpote, quippe, praesertim: 
as,—nec reprehend6: quippe cum ipse istam reprehénsidnem non figerim (Att. x.3.), 
I find no fault; since I myself did not escape that blame. 
Norr 2.— These causal and concessive uses of cum are of relative origin and are 
parallel to qui causal and concessive (§535. e). The attendant circumstances are re- 
garded as the cause of the action, or as tending to hinder it. 
Nore 3.—In early Latin cum (quom) causal and concessive usually takes the Indic-: 
ative: as, —quom tua rés distrahitur, utinam videam (Pl. Trin. 617), since your prop- 
erty is being torn in pieces, O that I may see, ete. 
a. Cum with the Indicative frequently introduces an explanatory 
statement, and is sometimes equivalent to quod, on the ground that: — 
cum tacent, claimant (Cat. i. 21), when they are silent, they cry out (i.e. their 
silence is an emphatic expression of their sentiments). 
gratulor tibi cum tantum valés apud Dolabellam (Fam. ix. 14. 3), I congratu- 
late you that you are so strong with Dolabella. 
Norr.— This is merely a special use of cum temporal expressing coincident time 
(§ 545. a). 
6. Cum... tum, signifying both . . . and, usually takes the Indica- 
tive; but when cum approaches the sense of while or though, the Sub- 
junctive is used (§ 549) :— 
cum multa nén probé, tum illud in primis (Fin. i. 18), while there are many 
things I do not approve, there is this in chief. [Indicative.] 
cum difficile est, tum né aequum quidem (Lael. 26), not only is it difficult 
but even unjust. 
cum rés tota ficta sit pueriliter, tum né efficit quidem quod vult (Fin. i. 19), 
while the whole thing is childishly got up, he does not even make his point 
(accomplish what he wishes). [Subjunctive; approaching cum causal. ] 
Antequam and Priusquam 
550. antequam and priusquam, before, introduce Clauses of Time which resemble 
those with cum temporal in their constructions. Priusquam consists of two parts (often 
written separately and sometimes separated by other words), the comparative adverb 
prius, sooner (before), which really modifies the main verb, and the relative particle 
quam, than, which introduces the subordinate clause. The latter is therefore a rela- 
tive clause, and takes the Indicative or the Subjunctive (like other relative clauses) 
according to the sense intended. The Subjunctive with priusquam is related to that of 
purpose (§ 529) and is sometimes called the Anticipatory or Prospective Subjunctive. 
Antequam, like priusquam, consists of two words, the first of which is the adverb ante, 
before, modifying the main verb. Its constructions are the same as those of priusquam, 
but the latter is commoner in classic prose. 
551. Antequam and priusquam take sometimes the Indicative, 
sometimes the Subjunctive. | | 
   
-P-A-G-E-368
  856 SYNTAX: TEMPORAL CLAUSES [§ 551 
a. With antequam or priusquam the Perfect Indicative states a 
fact in past time :— 
antequam tuds légi litterds, hominem ire cupiébam (Att. ii. 7. 2), before I 
read your letter, I wished the man to go. 
neque ante dimisit eum quam fidem dedit aduléscéns (Liv. xxxix. 10), and 
she did not let the young man go till he pledged his faith. 
neque prius fugere déstitérunt quam ad fliimen pervénérunt (B. G. i. 53), nor 
did they stop-running until they reached the river. 
Norr.— The Perfect Indicative in this construction is regular when the main 
clause is negative and the main verb is in an historical tense. The Imperfect Indicative 
is rare; the Pluperfect Indicative, very rare. The Perfect Subjunctive is rare and 
ante-classical, except in Indirect Discourse. 
6. With antequam or priusquam the Imperfect Subjunctive is com- 
mon when the subordinate verb implies purpose or expectancy in past 
time, or when the action that it denotes did not take place : — 
ante piignari coeptum est quam satis instruerétur aciés (Liv. xxii. 4. 7), the 
Sight was begun before the line could be properly formed. 
priusquam tii suum sibi vénderés, ipse possédit (Phil. ii. 96), before you could 
sell him his own property, he took possession of it himself. 
priusquam télum abici posset aut nostri propius accéderent, omnis Vari aciés 
terga vertit (B. C. ii. 34), before a weapon could be thrown or our men 
approached nearer, the whole line about Varus took flight. 
Note 1.—The Pluperfect Subjunctive is rare, except in Indirect Discourse by se- 
quence of tenses for the Future Perfect Indicative (§ 484. ¢): as, —antequam hominés 
nefarii dé med adventii audire potuissent, in Macedoniam perréxi (Planc. 98), before 
those evil men could learn of my coming, I arrived in Macedonia. 
Nortz 2.— After an historical present the Present Subjunctive is used instead of the 
Imperfect: as,—neque ab ed prius Domitiaini milités discédunt quam in cOnspectum 
Caesaris dédiicdtur (B. C. i. 22), and the soldiers of Domitius did (do) not leave him 
until he was (is) conducted into Cxsar’s presence. So, rarely, the Perfect Subjunctive 
(as B. G. iii. 18). 
  ec, Antequam and priusquam, when referring to future time, take the 
Present or Future Perfect Indicative ; rarely the Present Subjunctive: 
priusquam dé céteris rébus responded, dé amicitia pauca dicam (Phil. ii. 8), 
before I reply to the rest, I will say a little about friendship. 
non défatigibor antequam illdrum ancipités viis percéperd (De Or. iii, 145), 
I shall not weary till I have traced out their doubtful ways. 
antequam veniat litterais mittet (Leg. Agr. ii. 53), before he comes, he will send 
a letter. 
Norte 1.— The Future Indicative is very rare. 
Nore 2.— In a few cases the Subjunctive of present general condition is found with 
antequam and priusquam (cf. § 518. a): as,—in omnibus negotiis priusquam aggrediare, 
adhibenda est praeparatid diligéns (Off. i.73), in all undertakings, before you proceed 
to action, careful preparation must be used.

  §§ 552-554] DUM, DONEC, AND QUOAD : 357 
Dum, Donec, and Quoad 
552. Asan adverb meaning for a time, awhile, dum is found in old Latin, chiefly 
as an enclitic (cf. vixdum, ndndum). Its use as a conjunction comes either through 
correlation (cf. cum.,, tum,si... sic) or through substitution for a conjunction, as 
in the English the moment I saw it, I understood. Quoad is a compound of the rela- 
tive qué, up to which point, with ad. The origimand early history of ddnec are unknown. 
553. Dum and quoad, wnti/, take the; Present or Imperfect Sub- 
junctive in temporal clauses implying éntention or expectancy : — 
exspectas fortasse dum dicat (Tusc. ii. 17), you are waiting perhaps for him 
to say (until he say). [Dum is especially common after exspecté.] 
dum reliquae navés convenirent, ad hdram nonam exspectavit (B. G. iv. 23), 
he waited till the ninth hour for the rest of the ships to join him. 
comitia dilata [sunt] dum léx ferrétur (Att. iv. 17. 3), the election was post- 
poned until a law should be passed. 
an id exspectémus, quoad né vestigium quidem Asiae civitatum atque urbium 
telinquatur (Phil. xi. 25), shall we wait for this until not a trace is left of 
the states and cities of Asia? 
Epaminondas exercébitur plirimum luctandd ad eum finem quoad stans 
complecti posset atque contendere (Nep. Epam. 2), Hpaminondas trained 
himself in wrestling so far as to be able (until he should be able) to grapple 
standing and fight (in that way). 
Nore 1.— Donec is similarly used in poetry and later Latin; as,—et dixit longé 
ddnec curvata coirent inter sé capita (Aen. xi. 860), and drew it (the bow) until the 
curved tips touched each other. 
Nore 2.—Dum, until, may be used with the Present or Future Perfect Indicative 
to state a future fact when there is no idea of intention or expectancy; but this con- 
struction is rare in classic prose. The Future is alsofound inearly Latin. Dénec, until, 
is similarly used, in poetry and early Latin, with the Present and Future Perfect Indica- 
tive, rarely with the Future :— 
ego in Arcino opperior dum ista cdgndscé (Att. x. 3), I am waiting in the villa at 
Arce until I find this out. [This is really dum, while.] 
mihi aisque ciirae erit quid agis, dum quid égeris scierd (Fam, xii. 19. 3), I shall 
always feel anxious as to what you are doing, until I actually know (shall 
have known) what you have done. 
délicta maidrum lués ddnec templa reféceris (Hor. Od. iii. 6. 1), you shall suffer for 
the sins of your ancestors until you rebuild the temples. 
ter centum régnabitur annés, ddnec geminam parti dabit Ilia prolem (Aen. i. 272), 
sway shall be held for thrice a hundred years, until Ilia shall give birth to 
twin offspring. 
554. Donec and quoad, wntzl, with the Perfect Indicative denote 
an actual fact in past time: — 
ddnec rediit silentium fuit (Liv. xxiii. 31. 9), there was silence until he returned. 
Tisque e6 timui dénec ad réiciendds itidicés vénimus (Verr. ii. 1. 17), I was 
anxious until the moment when we came to challenge the jurors,

cidne isque ad eum finem dum iiidicés réiecti sunt (Verr. i. 16), he remained true to the 
agreement until the jurors were challenged. 
555. Dum, donec, and quoad, as long as, take the Indicative : — 
dum anima est, spés esse dicitur (Att. ix. 10. 3), as long as there is life, there 
is said to be hope. 
dum praesidia illa fuérunt, in Sullae praesidiis fuit (Rosc. Am. 126), so long 
as there were any garrisons, he was in the garrisons of Sulla. 
dum longius 4 minitidne aberant Galli, plis multitiidine télorum prdficiébant 
(B. G. vii. 82), so long as the Gauls were at a distance from the fortifica- 
tions, they had the advantage because of their missiles. 
donec gratus eram tibi, Persarum vigui rége beatior (Hor. Od. 9. 1), as 
long as I enjoyed thy favor, I flourished happier than the king of the 
Persians. 
quoad potuit fortissimé restitit (B. G. iv. 12), he resisted bravely as long as 
he could. 
Norte 1.—Donec in this use is confined to poetry and later writers. 
Nore 2. — Quam dit, as long as, takes the Indicative only: as, —sé oppidé tam ditt 
tenuit quam dit in provincia Parthi fuérunt (Fam. xii. 19.2), he kept himself within the 
town as long as the Parthians were in the province. 
    
556. Dum, while, regularly takes the Present Indicative to de- 
note continued action in past time. 
In translating, the English Imperfect must generally be used : — 
dum haec geruntur, Caesari niintiatum est (B. G. i. 46), while this was going 
on, @ message was brought to Cesar. 
; haec dum aguntur, intered Cleomenés iam ad Eldri litus pervénerat (Verr. v. 
91), while this was going on, Cleomenes meanwhile had come down to the 
coast at Elorum. 
hoc dum narrat, forte audivi (Ter. Haut. 272), I happened to hear this while 
she was telling it. ° 
Nore. — This construction is a special use of the Historical Present (§ 469). 
a. A past tense with dum (usually so long as) makes the time em- 
phatic by contrast; but a few irregular cases of dum with a past tense 
occur where no contrast is intended : 
nec enim dum eram vobiscum, animum meum vidébatis (Cat. M. 79), for 
while I was with you, you could not sce my soul. [Here the time when 
he was alive is contrasted with that after his death.] 
coorta est piigna, par dum cdnstabant ordinés (Liv. xxii. 47), a conflict began, 
well matched as long as the ranks stood firm. 
But,—dum oculds hostium certaémen averterat (id. xxxii. 24), while the 
struggle kept the eyes of the enemy turned away.

Nore. — In later writers, dum sometimes takes the Subjunctive when the classical 
usage would require the Indicative, and dénec, wntil, is freely used in this manner 
(especially by Tacitus) :— 
dum ea in Samnio gererentur, in Etruria interim bellum ingéns concitur (Liv. x. 
18), while this was being done in Samnium, meanwhile a great war was 
stirred up in Etruria. 
illa quidem dum té fugeret, hydrum non vidit (Georg. iv. 457), while she was fleeing 
from you she did not see the serpent. 
dum per vicds déportarétur, condormiébat (Suet. Aug. 78), while he was being car- 
ried through the streets he used to fall dead asleep. 
Rhénus servat ndmen et violentiam cursiis (qua Germaniam praevehitur) ddnec 
Oceand misceatur (Tac. Ann. ii. 6), the Rhine keeps its name and rapid course 
(where it borders Germany) until it mingles with the ocean.

latiOne déterrérentur (id. i. 1), for describing the times of Augustus there 
was no lack of talent until it was frightened away by the increasing servility 
of the age. 
For dum, provided that, see § 528. 
CLAUSES WITH QuIV AND QuUOMINUS 
557. The original meaning of quin is how not? why not? (qui-né), and when 
used with the Indicative or (rarely) with the Subjunctive it regularly implies a general 
negative. Thus, quin ego hic rogem? why should n’t I ask this? implies that there is 
no reason for not asking. The implied negative was then expressed in a main clause, 
like niilla causa est or fieri ndn potest. Hence come the various dependent construc- 
tions introduced by quin. 
Quéminus is really a phrase (qué minus), and the dependent constructions which it 
introduces have their origin in the relative clause of purpose with qué and a com- 
parative (see § 531. a). 
558. A subjunctive clause with quin is used after verbs and 
other expressions of hindering, resisting, refusing, doubting, de- 
laying, and the like, when these are negatived, either expressly or 
by implication : 
non himana flla neque divina obstant quin socids amicds trahant exscindant 
. (Sall. Ep. Mith. 17), no human or divine laws prevent them from taking 
captive and exterminating their friendly allies. 
ut né Suessionés quidem déterrére potuerint quin cum his cdnsentirent (B. G.

    362 SYNTAX: SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES [s§ 560-563 
SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES 
560. A clause which is used as a noun may be called a Substantive Clause, as 
certain relative clauses are sometimes called adjective clauses. But in practice the 
term is restricted to clauses which represent a nominative or an accusative case, the 
clauses which stand for an ablative being sometimes called adverbial clauses. 
Even with this limitation the term is not quite precise (see p. 367, footnote 1). The 
fact is rather that the clause and the leading verb are mutually complementary ; each 
reinforces the other. The simplest and probably the earliest form of such sentences 
is to be found in the paratactic use (see § 268) of two verbs like volé abeas, dicimus 
cénsed, adeam optimum est. From such verbs the usage spread by analogy to other 
verbs (see lists on pp. 363, 367, footnotes), and the complementary relation of the 
clause to the verb came to resemble the complementary force of the accusative, espe- 
cially the accusative of cognate meaning (§ 390). 
561. A clause used as a noun is called a Substantive Clause. 
a. A Substantive Clause may be used as the Subject or Object of 
a verb, as an Appositive, or as a Predicate Nominative or Accusative. 
Nore 1.— Many ideas which in English take the form of an abstract noun may be 
rendered by a substantive clause in Latin. Thus, he demanded an investigation may 
be postulabat ut quaestid habérétur. The common English expression for with the 
infinitive also corresponds to a Latin substantive clause: as,—it remains for me to 
speak of the piratic war, reliquum est ut dé belld dicam piratico. 
Nore 2.— When a Substantive Clause is used as subject, the verb to which it is 
subject is called impersonal, and the sign of the construction in English is commonly 
the so-called expletive rr. 
562. Substantive Clauses are classified as follows : — 
1. Subjunctive Clauses { a. Of purpose (command, wish, fear) (§§ 568, 564). 
(ut, né, ut non, etc.). | b. Of result (happen, effect, etc.) (§ 568). 
2. Indicative Clauses with quod: Fact, Specification, Feeling (§ 572). 
8. Indirect Questions: Subjunctive, introduced by an Interrogative Word 
(§§ 573-576). 
= a. With verbs of ordering, wishing, etc. (§ 568). 
mete: C NURS { b, Indirect Discourse (§ 579 ff.). Ce 
Norn. — The Infinitive with Subject Accusative is not strictly a clause, but in Latin 
it has undergone so extensive a development that it may be so classed. The uses of 
the Infinitive Clause are of two kinds: (1) in constructions in which it replaces a sub- 
junctive clause with ut etc.; (2) in the Indirect Discourse. The first class will be dis- 
cussed in connection with the appropriate subjunctive constructions ($563) ; for Indirect 
Discourse, see § 579 ff. 
Substantive Clauses of Purpose 
563. Substantive Clauses of Purpose with ut (negative n@) are 
used as the object of verbs denoting an action directed toward the 
Suture.
-P-A-G-E-375
§ 563] SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES OF PURPOSE 363 
Such are, verbs meaning to admonish, ask, bargain, command, de- 
cree, determine, permit, persuade, resolve, urge, and wish : —1 
monet ut omnés suspiciOnés vitet (B. G. i. 20), he warns him to avoid all 
suspicion. 
hortatur eds né anim6 déficiant (B. C. i. 19), he urges them not to lose heart. 
té rogd atque dr6 ut eum iuvés (Fam. xiii. 66), I beg and pray you to aid him. 
his uti conquirerent imperavit (B. G. i. 28), he ordered them to search. 
persuddet Casticd ut régnum occuparet (id. i. 3), he persuades Casticus to 
usurp royal power. 
suis imperavit né quod omniné6 télum réicerent (id. i. 46), he ordered his men 
not to throw back any weapon at all. 
Nors.— With any verb of these classes the poets may use the Infinitive instead of 
an object clause: — 
hortamur fari (Aen. ii. 74), we urge [him] to speak. 
né quaere docéri (id. vi. 614), seek not to be told. 
temptat praevertere (id. i. 721), she attempts to turn, etc. 
For the Subjunctive without ut with verbs of commanding, see § 565. a. 
a. Tubed, order, and vetd, forbid, take the Infinitive with Subject 
Accusative : — 
Labiénum iugum montis ascendere iubet (B. G. i. 21), he orders Labienus to 
ascend the ridge of the hill. 
liberds ad sé addiici iussit (id. ii. 5), he ordered the children to be brought to him. 
ab opere légatds discédere vetuerat (id. ii. 20), he had forbidden the lieutenants 
to leave the work. 
vetuére [bona] reddi (Liv. ii. 5), they forbade the return of the goods (that the 
goods be returned). 
Norr.— Some other verbs of commanding ete. occasionally take the Infinitive :— 
pontem imperant fieri (B. C. i. 61), they order a bridge to be built. 
rés monet cavére (Sall. Cat. 52. 3), the occasion warns us to be on our guard. 
b. Verbs of wishing take either the Infinitive or the Subjunctive. 
With vold (nd16, mal6) and cupid the Infinitive is commoner, and 
the subject of the infinitive is rarely expressed when it would be the 
same as that of the main verb. 
With other verbs of wishing the Subjunctive is commoner when 
the subject changes, the Infinitive when it remains the same. 
1. Subject of dependent verb same as that of the verb of wishing : — 
augur fieri volui (Fam. xv. 4. 18), I wished to be made augur. 
cupid vigiliam meam tibi tradere (id. xi. 24), I am eager to hand over my watch 
to you. 
1 Such verbs or verbal phrases are id ago, ad id venid, caved (né), cénsed, cdgd, con- 
cédd, cOnstitud, ciird, décernd, Edicd, flagitd, hortor, imperd, instd, mando, metud (né),

For vold and its compounds with the Subjunctive without ut, see § 565. 
e. Verbs of permitting take either the Subjunctive or the Infini- 
tive. Patior takes regularly the Infinitive with Subject Accusative ; 
so offen sind : — 
permisit ut faceret (De Or. ii. 366), permitted him to make. 
concédd tibi ut ea praetereds (Rosc. Am, 54), I allow you to pass by these

§ 500. 4. 
Nore 2.— Verbs of decreeing and voting often take the Infinitive of the Second 
Periphrastic conjugation: —Régulus captivés reddendés [esse] non cénsuit (Off. i. 39), 
Regulus voted that the captives should not be returned. (He said, in giving his formal 
opinion: captivi ndn reddendi sunt.] .

Norx 2.— Ut né occurs occasionally with verbs of caution and effort (ef. § 531): — 
cara et providé ut néquid ei désit (Att. xi. 3. 3), take care and see that he lacks nothing. 
For the Subjunctive with quin and quéminus with verbs of hindering etc., see § 558. 
564. Verbs of fearing take the Subjunctive, with né, affirma- 
tive and né non or ut negative. 
In this use né is commonly to be translated by that, ut and né non 
by that not : — 
: timed né Verrés fécerit (Verr. v. 3), I fear that Verres has done, etc. 
né animum offenderet verébatur (B. G. i. 19), he feared that he should hurt 
the feelings, etc. 
né exhérédarétur veritus est (Rose. Am. 58), he feared that he should be dis- 
inherited. 
drator metud né languéscat senectiite (Cat. M. 28), I fear the orator grows 
Feeble from old age. 
vereor ut tibi possim concédere (De Or. i. 35), I fear that I cannot grant you. 
haud sané periculum est né ndn mortem optandam putet (‘Tuse. v. 118), there 
is no danger that he will not think death desirable. 
Nore.—The subjunctive in né-clauses after a verb of fearing is optative in origin. 
To an independent né-sentence, as né accidat, may it not happen, a verb may be prefixed 
(cf. § 560), making a complex sentence. Thus, vidé né accidat; 6rd né accidat; cavet né 
accidat ; when the prefixed verb is one of fearing, timed né accidat becomes let it not hap- 
pen, but I fear that it may. The origin of the ut-clause is similar. 
565. Vols and its compounds, the impersonals licet and oportet, 
and the imperatives dic and fac often take the Subjunctive with- 
out ut: — 
vold amés (Att. ii. 10), I wish you to love. 
quam vellem mé invitassés (Fam. x. 28. 1), how I wish you had invited me! 
mallem Cerberum metuerés (Tusc. i. 12), I had rather you feared Cerberus, 
sint enim oportet (id. i. 12), for they must exist. 
queramur licet (Caec. 41), we are allowed to complain. 
fac diligas (Att. iii. 13. 2), do love! [A periphrasis for the imperative dilige, 
love (cf. § 449. c).] 
lic exeat, tell him to go out.

Nore 1.—In such cases there is no ellipsis of ut. The expressions are idiomatic 
remnants of an older construction in which the subjunctives were hortatory or optative 
and thus really independent of the verb of wishing ete. In the classical period, how- 
ever, they were doubtless felt as subordinate. Compare the use of cavé and the sub- 
junetive (without né) in Prohibitions (§ 450), which appears to follow the analogy of fac, 
Nore 2.—Licet may take (1) the Subjunctive, usually without ut; (2) the simple 
Infinitive; (3) the Infinitive with Subject Accusative; (4) the Dative and the Infini- 
tive (see § 455.1). Thus, I may go is licet eam, licet ire, licet mé ire, or licet mihi ire. 
For.licet in concessive clauses, see § 527. b. 
Nore 3.—Oportet may take (1) the Subjunctive without ut; (2) the simple Infini- 
tive; (8) the Infinitive with Subject Accusative. Thus J must go is oportet eam, oportet 
ire, or oportet mé ire. 
a. Verbs of commanding and the like often take the subjunctive 
without ut: — 
huic mandat Rémis adeat (B. G. iii. 11), he orders him to visit the Remi. 
rogat finem faciat (id. i. 20), he asks him to cease. 
Mnésthea vocat, classem aptent socii (Aen. iv. 289), he calls Mnestheus [and 
orders that] his comrades shall make ready the fleet. 
Norr.— The subjunctive in this construction is the hortatory subjunctive used to 
express a command in Indirect Discourse (§ 588). 
Substantive Clauses of Purpose with Passive Verbs 
566. A Substantive Clause used as the object of a verb becomes 
the subject when the verb is put in the passive (Impersonal Con- 
struction): — 
Caesar ut cdgnisceret postulatum est (B. C. i. 87), Cesar was requested to 
make an investigation (it was requested that Cesar should make an 
investigation). 
si erat Héraclid ab senatii mandatum ut emeret (Verr. iii. 88), if Heraclius 
had been instructed by the senate to buy. 
si persuasum erat Cluvid ut mentirétur (Rosc. Com. 51), if Cluvius had been 
persuaded to lie, 
putd concédi ndbis oportére ut Graecd verbd atamur (Fin. iii. 15), I think 
we must be allowed to use a Greek word. : 
né quid eis nocedtur 4 Caesare cavétur (B. C. i. 86), Cesar takes care that no 
harm shall be done them (care is taken by Cesar lest, etc.). 
a. With verbs of admonishing, the personal object becomes the 
subject and the object clause is retained : — 
admoniti sumus ut cavérémus (Att. viii. 11 p. 3), we were warned to be careful. 
cum monérétur ut cautior esset (Div. i. 51), when he was advised to be more 
cautious.

b. Some verbs that take an infinitive instead of a subjunctive 
are used impersonally in the passive, and the infinitive becomes the 
subject of the sentence : — 
loqui ndn concéditur (B. G. vi. 20), it is not allowed to speak. 
ec. With iubed, vetd, and cig, the subject accusative of the infinitive 
becomes the subject nominative of the main verb, and the infinitive is 
retained as complementary (Personal Construction) : — 
adesse iubentur postridié (Verr. ii. 41), they are ordered to be present on the 
Sollowing day. 
ire in exsilium iussus est (Cat. ii. 12), he was ordered to go into exile. 
Simonidés vetitus est navigdre (Div. ii. 184), Simonides was forbidden to sail. 
Mandubii exire cdguntur (B. G. vii. 78), the Mandubii are compelled to go out. 
Substantive Clauses of Result (Consecutive Clauses) 
567. Clauses of Result may be used substantively, (1) as the object of facid etc. 
(§ 568); (2) as the subject of these same verbs in the passive, as well as of other verbs 
and verbal phrases (§ 569); (8) in apposition with another substantive, or as predicate 
nominative etc. (see §§ 570, 571).1 
568. Substantive Clauses of Result with ut (negative ut nn) 
are used as the object of verbs denoting the accomplishment of 
an effort. 
Such are especially facid and its compounds (efficis, cdnficid, ete.) : — 
efficiam ut intellegatis (Clu. 7), I will make you understand (lit. effect that 
you, etc.). [So, faciam ut intellegatis (id. 9).] 
commeatiis ut portari possent efficiébat (B. G. ii. 5), made it possible that 
supplies could be brought. 
perféci ut é régn6 ille discéderet (Fam. xv. 4. 6), I brought about his departure 
From the kingdom. 
quae libertis ut laetior esset régis superbia fécerat (Liv. ii. 1), the arrogance 
of the king had made this liberty more welcome. 
6vincunt instando ut litterae darentur (id. ii. 4), by insisting they gain their 
point, — that letters should be sent. [Here évincunt = efficiunt. ] 
1 In all these cases the clause is not strictly subject or object. The main verb orig- 
mally conveyed a meaning sufficient in itself, and the result clause was merely com- 
plementary. This is seen by the frequent use of ita and the like with the main verb 
(ita accidit ut, etc.). In like manner purpose clauses are only apparently subject or 
object of the verb with which they are connected. 
2 Verbs and phrases taking an ut-clause of result as subject or object are accédit, 
accidit, additur, altera est rés, committd, cnsequor, contingit, efficid, évenit, facid, fit, fieri 
potest, fore, impetrd, integrum est, nfds est, miinus est, necesse est, prope est, réctum est.

Nore 1.— The expressions facere ut, committere ut, with the subjunctive, often form 
a periphrasis for the simple verb: as,—invitus féci ut Flaminium é senata Gicerem 
(Cat. M. 42), it was with reluctance that I expelled Flaminius from the senate. 
569. Substantive Clauses of Result are used as the subject of 
the following : — 
1. Of passive verbs denoting the accomplishment of an effort : — 
impetraitum est ut in senatii recitarentur (litterae) (B. C. i. 1), they succeeded 
in having the letter read in the senate (it was brought about that, etc.). 
ita efficitur ut omne corpus mortale sit (N. D. iii. 30), i therefore is made 
out that every body is mortal. 
2. Of Impersonals meaning it happens, it remains, it follows, it is 
necessary, it is added, and the like (§ 568, footnote) : — 
accidit ut esset lina pléna (B. G. iv. 29), it happened to be full moon (it hap- 
pened that it was, etc.). [Here ut esset is subject of accidit.] 
reliquum est ut officiis certémus inter nds (Fam. vii. 31), it remains for us to

restat ut hdc dubitémus (Rosc. Am. 88), it is left for us to doubt this. 
sequitur ut doceam (N. D. ii. 81), the next thing is to show (it follows, etc.). 
Nore 1.—The infinitive sometimes occurs: as,—nec enim acciderat mihi opus 
esse (Fam. vi. 11. 1), for it had not happened to be necessary to me. 
Norn 2.—Necesse est often takes the subjunctive without ut; as, —conc8das necesse 
est (Rose. Am. 87), you must grant. 
38. Of est in the sense of it is the fact that, etc. (mostly poetic): — 
est ut vird vir latius drdinet arbusta (Hor. Od. iii. 1. 9), it is the fact that one 
man plants his vineyards in wider rows than another. 
a. Fore (or futiirum esse) ut with a clause of result as subject is 
often used instead of the Future Infinitive active or passive; so 
necessarily in verbs which have no supine stem : — 
spérd fore ut contingat id nobis (Tuse. i. 82), I hope that will be our happy lot. 
cum vidérem fore ut ndn possem (Cat. ii. 4), when I saw that I should not be able 
570. A substantive clause of result may be in apposition with 
another substantive (especially a neuter pronoun):— 
illud etiam restiterat, ut té in itis édiicerent (Quinct. 38), this too remained — 
Sor them to drag you into court. 
571. A substantive clause of result may serve as predicate 
nominative after més est and similar expressions : —

the way of men to be unwilling for one man to excel in several things.

§§ 571, 572] INDICATIVE WITH QUOD 369 
a. A result clause, with or without ut, frequently follows quam 
after a comparative (but see § 583. ¢): — 
Canachi signa rigididra sunt quam ut imitentur véritatem (Brut. 70), the statues 
of Canachus are too stiff to represent nature (stiffer than that they should). 
perpessus est omnia potius quam indicaret (Tusc, ii. 52), he endured all rather 
than betray, etc. [Regularly without ut except in Livy.] 
b. The phrase tantum abest, i¢ is so far [from being the case], 
regularly takes two clauses of result with ut: one is substantive, the 
subject of abest ; the other is adverbial, correlative with tantum: — 
tantum abest ut nostra mirémur, ut fisque ed difficilés ac modrdsi simus, ut 
nobis non satis faciat ipse Démosthenés (Or. 104), so far from admiring 
my own works, I am difficult and captious to that degree that not Demos- 
thenes himself satisfies me. [Here the first ut-clause is the subject of 
abest (§ 569. 2); the second, a result clause after tantum (§ 537); and 
the third, after isque ed. ] 
c. Rarely, a thought or an idea is considered as a result, and is 
expressed by the subjunctive with ut instead of the accusative and 
infinitive (§ 580). In this case a demonstrative usually precedes: 
praeclarum illud est, ut eds... amémus (Tuse. iii. 73), this is a noble thing, 
that we should love, etc. 
véri simile ndn est ut ille antepdneret (Verr. iv. 11), it is not likely that he 
preferred. 4 
For Relative Clauses with quin after verbs of hindering etc., see § 558. 
Indicative with Quod 
572. A peculiar form of Substantive Clause consists of quod 
(in the sense of that, the fact that) with the Indicative. 
The clause in the Indicative with quod is used when the state- 
ment is regarded as a fact : — 
alterum est vitium, quod quidam nimis magnum studium conferunt (Off. i. 19), 
it is another fault that some bestow too much zeal, etc. [Here ut conferant 
could be used, meaning that some should bestow; or the accusative and 
infinitive, meaning to bestow (abstractly); quod makes it a fact that men 
do bestow, etc. ] 
inter inanimum et animal hdc maximé interest, quod animal agit aliquid 
(Acad. ii. 37), this is the chief difference between an inanimate object and 
an animal, that an animal aims at something. 
quod rediit nobis mirabile vidétur (Off. iii. 111), that he (Regulus) returned 
seems wonderful to us.

quod dé dom6 scribis, ego, etc. (Fam. xiv. 2. 3), as to what you write of the 
house, I, etc. 
b. Verbs of feeling and the expression of feeling take either quod 
(quia) or the accusative and infinitive (Indirect Discourse) : — 
quod scribis . . . gauded (Q. Fr. iii. 1. 9), I am glad that you write. 
facid libenter quod eam ndn possum praeterire (Legg. i. 63), I am glad that I 
cannot pass it by. 
quae perfecta esse vehementer laetor (Rosc. Am. 186), I greatly rejoice that 
this is finished. 
qui quia non habuit 4 mé turmas equitum fortasse suscénset (Att. vi. 3. 5), who 
perhaps feels angry that he did not receive squadrons of cavalry from me. 
molesté tuli té senatui gratiis non égisse (Fam. x. 27. 1), I was displeased 
that you did not return thanks to the senate. 
Nore. — Miror and similar expressions are sometimes followed by a clause with si.l 
This is apparently substantive, but really protasis (cf. § 563. e. N.1). Thus, — miror 
si quemquam amicum habére potuit (Lael.54), [wonder if he could ever have a friend. 
{Originally, If this is so, I wonder at it.] 
Indirect Questions 
573. An Indirect Question is any sentence or clause which is 
introduced by an interrogative word (pronoun, adverb, etc.), and 
which is itself the subject or object of a verb, or depends on any 
expression implying uncertainty or doubt. 
In grammatical form, exclamatory sentences are not distin- 
guished from interrogative (see the third example below). 
1Cf. the Greek davudfw el.
-P-A-G-E-383
  §§ 574, 575] INDIRECT QUESTIONS 871 
574. An Indirect Question takes its verb in the Subjunctive : 
‘quid ipse sentiam exponam (Div. i. 10), I will explain what I think. (Direct: 
quid senti6 ?] 
id possetne fieri consuluit (id. i. 32), he consulted whether it could be done. 
[Direct : potestne ?] 
quam sis audax omnés intellegere potuérunt (Rose. Am. 87), all could under- 
stand how bold you are. [Direct: quam es audax !] 
doleam necne doleam nihil interest (Tuse. ii. 29), it is of no account whether I 
suffer or not. [Double question. ] 
quaesivi 4 Catilina in conventi apud M. Laecam fuisset necne (Cat. ii. 13), I 
asked Catiline whether he had been at the meeting at Marcus Leca’s or 
not. [Double question. ] 
rogat mé quid sentiam, he asks me what I think. [Cf. rogat mé sententiam, he 
asks me my opinion. ] 
hoc dubium est, uter nostrum sit inverécundior (Acad. ii. 126), this is doubt- 
Sul, which of us two is the less modest. 
incerti quatenus Volerd exercéret victoriam (Liv. ii. 55), uncertain how far 
Volero would push victory. [As if dubitantés quatenus, etc. ] 
Nore. — An Indirect Question may be the subject of a verb (as in the fourth exam- 
ple), the direct object (as in the first), the secondary object (as in the sixth), an apposi- 
tive (as in the seventh). 
575. The Sequence of Tenses in Indirect Question is illus- 
trated by the following examples : — 
dicd quid faciam, I tell you what I am doing. 
dicd quid factirus sim, I tell you what I will (shall) do. 
dicd quid fécerim, I tell you what I did (have done, was doing). 
dixi quid facerem, I told you what I was doing. 
dixi quid fécissem, I told you what I had done (had been doing). 
dixi quid factiirus essem, I told you what I would (should) do (was going to do). 
dixi quid factiirus fuissem, I told you what I would (should) have done. 
a. Indirect Questions referring to future time take the subjunc. 
tive of the First Periphrastic Conjugation : — 
prospicid qui concursiis futiri sint (Caecil. 42), I foresee what throngs there * 
will be. [Direct: qui erunt ?] 
quid sit futirum cras, fuge quaerere (Hor. Od. i. 9. 13), forbear to ask what will 
be on the morrow. [Direct: quid erit or futdrum est ?] 
posthac non scribam ad té quid factiirus sim, sed quid fécerim (Att. x. 18), 
hereafter I shall not write to you what I am going to do, but what I have 
done. [Direct: quid faciés (or factiirus eris)? quid fécisti ?] 
Norg. — This Periphrastic Future avoids the ambiguity which would be caused by 
using the Present Subjunctive to refer to future time in such clauses. 
b. The Deliberative Subjunctive (§ 444) remains unchanged in an 
Indirect Question, except sometimes in tense : —
-P-A-G-E-384
    872 SYNTAX; SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES [§§ 575, 576 
qué mé vertam nescid (Clu. 4), Z do not know which way to turn, [Direct: 
quo mé vertam ?] 
neque satis cénstabat quid agerent (B. G. iii. 14), and it was not very clear what 
they were to do. [Direct: quid agamus ?] 
nec quisquam satis certum habet, quid aut spéret aut timeat (Liv. xxii. 7. 10), 
nor is any one well assured what he shall hope or fear. [Here the future 
participle with sit could not be used,] 
incertd quid peterent aut vitarent (id. xxviii. 36. 12), since it was doubiful 
(ablative absolute) what they should seek or shun. 
ce. Indirect Questions often take the Indicative in early Latin and 
in poetry : — ss 
vineam qué in agro cénseri oportet sic obseryatd (Cato R, R. 6, 4), in what 
soil a vineyard should be set you must observe thus, 
d. Nescid quis, when used in an indefinite sense (somebody or other), 
is not followed by the Subjunctive, 
So also nescid qué (unde, etc.), and the following idiomatic phrases 
which are practically adverbs: — 
mirum (nimirum) quam, marvellously (marvellous how). 
mirum quantum, tremendously (marvellous how much). 
immane quantum, monstrously (monstrous how much). 
sané quam, immensely. 
valdé quam, enormously. 
Examples are: — 
qui istam nescid quam indolentiam magnopere laudant (Tuso. iii, 12), who 
greatly extol that freedom from pain, whatever it is. 
mitum quantum préfuit (Liv. ii. 1), it helped prodigiously, 
ita f4td nescid qué contigisse arbitror (Fam, xy. 18), I think it happened so 
by some fatality or other. 
nam suds valdé quam paucés habet (id, xi. 13 a. 3), for he has uncommonly 
Sew of his own. 
sané quam sum givisus (id. xi: 18 a. 4), I was immensely glad. 
immane quantum discrepat (Hor. Od. i. 27. 5), is monstrously at variance. 
576. In colloquial usage and in poetry the subject of an In- 
direct Question is often attracted into the main clause as object 
(Accusative of Anticipation) : — 
nosti Marcellum quam tardus sit (Fam. viii. 10, 3), you know how slow Mar- 
cellus is, [For nésti quam tardus sit Marcellus. Cf. ‘I know thee who 
thou art.’’] 
Cf. potestne igitur earum rérum, qua ré futiirae sint, fila esse praesénsio (Div. 
ii. 15), can there be, then, any foreknowledge as to those things, why they 
will occur? [A similar use of the Objective Genitive. ]
-P-A-G-E-385
  §§ 576, 577] _ INDIRECT DISCOURSE 373 
Nors. — In some cases the Object of Anticipation becomes the Subject by a change 
of voice, and an apparent mixture of relative and interrogative constructions is the 
result :— 
quidam saepe in parva peciinia perspiciuntur quam sint levés (Lael, 63), it is often 
seen, in a trifling matter of money, how unprincipled some people are (some 
people are often seen through, how unprincipled they are). 
quem ad modum Pompéium oppignarent 4 mé indicati sunt (Leg. Agr.i.5), it has 
been shown by me in what way they attacked Pompey y (they have been shown 
by me, how they attacked). 
a. An indirect question is occasionally introduced by si in the 
sense of whether (like if in English, cf, § 572. 6. n.): 
circumfunduntur hostés si quem aditum reperire possent (B. G. vi. 87), the 
enemy pour round [to see] if they can find entrance. 
visam si domi est (Ter. Haut. 170), I will go see if he is at home. 
  Norx. — This is strictly a Protasis, but usually no Apodosis is thought of, and the 
clause is virtually an Indirect Question, 
For the Potential Subjunctive with forsitan (originally an Indixect Question), see 
§ 447. a. 
INDIRECT DISCOURSE 
577. The use of the Accusative and Infinitive in Indirect Discourse (dratid obliqua) 
is a comparatively late form.of speech, developed in the Latin and Greek only, and 
perhaps separately in each of them. It is wholly wanting in Sanskrit, but some forms 
like it have grown up in English and German. 
The essential character of Indirect Discourse is, that the language of some other 
person than the writer or speaker is compressed into a kind of Substantive Clause, the 
verb of the main clause becoming Infinitive, while modifying clauses, as well as all 
hortatory forms of speech, take the Subjunctive. The person of the verb necessarily 
conforms to the new relation of persons. 
The construction of Indirect Discourse, however, is not limited to reports of the 
language of some person other than the speaker; it may be used to express what any 
one — whether the speaker or some one else — says, thinks, or perceives, whenever that 
which is said, thought, or perceived is capable of being expressed in the form of a com- 
plete sentence. For anything that can be said ete. can also be reported indirectly as 
well as directly, 
The use of the Infinitive in the main clause undoubtedly comes from itg use as a 
case-form to complete or modify the action expressed by the verb of saying and its 
object together, This object in time came to be regarded as, and in fact to all intents 
became, the subject of the infinitive. A transition state is found in Sanskrit, which, 
though it has no indirect discourse proper, yet allows an indirect predication after verbs 
of saying and the like by means of a predicative apposition, in such expressions as 
“The maids told the king [that] his daughter [was] bereft of her senses.” 
The simple form of indirect statement with the accusative and infinitive was after- 
wards amplified by introducing dependent or modifying clauses; and in Latin it became 
acommon construction, and could be used to report whole speeches etc., which in other 
languages would have the direct form. (Compare the style of reporting speeches in 
English, where only the person and tense are changed.) 
The Subjunctive in the subordinate clauses of Indirect Discourse has no significance 
except to make more distinct the fact that these clauses are subordinate; consequently 
no direct connection has been traced between them and the uses of the mood in simple
-P-A-G-E-386
  874 SYNTAX: SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES [$$ 577-580 
sentences. It is probable that the subjunctive in indirect questions (§ 574), in informal 
indirect discourse (§ 592), and in clauses of the integral part (§ 593) represents the 
earliest steps of a movement by which the subjunctive became in some degree a mood 
of subordination. 
The Subjunctive standing for hortatory forms of speech in Indirect Discourse is 
simply the usual hortatory subjunctive, with only a change of person and tense (if 
necessary), as in the reporter’s style. 
578. A Direct Quotation gives the exact words of the original 
speaker or writer (Ordtid Récta). 
An Indirect Quotation adapts the words of the speaker or 
writer to the construction of the sentence in which they are 
quoted (Oratis Obliqua). 
Norr.— The term Indirect Discourse (dratié obliqua) is used in two senses. In 
the wider sense it includes all clauses — of whatever kind —which express the words 
or thought of any person indirectly, that is, in a form different from that in which the 
person said the words or conceived the thought. In the narrower sense the term Indi- 
rect Discourse is restricted to those cases in which some complete proposition is cited 
in the form of an Indirect Quotation, which may be extended to a narrative or an 
address of any length, as in the speeches reported by Cesar and Livy. In this book 
the term is used in the restricted sense. 
Format Inpirgect DiscourRsE 
579. Verbs and other expressions of knowing, thinking, telling, 
and perceiving, govern the Indirect Discourse. 
Norz.—Inquam, said I (etc.) takes the Direct Discourse except in poetry. 
Declaratory Sentences in Indirect Discourse 
580. In Indirect Discourse the main clause of a Declaratory 
Sentence is put in the Infinitive with Subject Accusative. All 
subordinate clauses take the Subjunctive : — 
scid mé paene incrédibilem rem pollicéri (B. C. iii. 86), I know that Iam 
promising an almost incredible thing. [Direct : polliceor.] 
non arbitror té ita sentire (Fam. x. 26. 2), I do not suppose that you feel 
thus. [Direct: sentis.] 
spérd mé liberatum [esse] dé metii (Tusc. ii. 67), I trust I have been freed 
from fear. (Direct: liberatus sum. ] 
1Such are: (1) knowing, scid, cdgndscd, compertum habed, etc.; (2) thinking, puto, 
existim6, arbitror, etc. ; (3) telling, dicd, ninti6, refers, polliceor, prémittd, certidrem facio, 
ete.; (4) perceiving, sentid, comperid, vided, audis, etc. So in general any word that 
denotes thought or mental and visual perception or their expression may govern the 
Indirect Discourse.
-P-A-G-E-387
§ 580] INDIRECT DISCOURSE 375 
[dicit] esse non nfllés quorum auctoritas plirimum valeat (B. G. i. 17), he 
says there are some, whose influence most prevails. [Direct: sunt non

nisi iirasset, scelus sé factirum [esse] arbitrabatur (Verr. ii. 1. 123), he 
thought he should incur guilt, wnless he should take the oath. [Direct : 
nisi ifiraverd, faciam. ] 
a. The verb of saying etc. is often not expressed, but implied in 
some word or in the general drift of the sentence : — 
cdnsulis alterius némen invisum civitati fuit: nimium Tarquinids régnd 
adsuésse; initium 4 Priscd factum; régnasse dein Ser. Tullium, etc. 
(Liv. ii. 2), the name of the other consul was hateful to the state; the Tar- 
quins (they thought) had become too much accustomed to royal power, etc. 
[Here invisum implies a EROUEL ER, and this thought is added in the 
form of Indirect Discourse. ] 
drantés ut urbibus saltem —iam enim agris dépliratds esse — opem senatus 
ferret (id. xli. 6), praying that the senate would at least bring aid to the 
cities —for the fields [they said] were already given up as lost. 
b. The verb negé, deny, is commonly used in preference to dicd with 
a negative : — 
[Stdicl] negant quidquam [esse] bonum nisi quod honestum sit (Fin. ii. 68), 
the Stoics assert that nothing is good but what is right. 
e. Verbs of promising, hoping, expecting, threatening, swearing, 
and the like, regularly take the construction of Indirect Discourse, 
contrary to the English idiom :— 
mindtur sésé abire (Pl. Asin. 604), he threatens to go away. [Direct: abe, 
I am going away.] 
spérant sé maximum friictum esse captirds (Lael. 79), they hope to gain the 
utmost advantage. [Direct: capiémus.] 
spérat sé absolitum iri (Sull. 21), he hopes that he shall be acquitted. [Direct: 
absolvar. ] 
quem inimicissimum futiirum esse prdmittd ac sponded (Mur. 90), who I 
promise and warrant will be the bitterest of enemies. [Direct: erit.] 
dolor fortitiidinem sé débilitatirum minatur (Tusc. v. 76), pain threatens to 
wear down fortitude. [Direct : débilitabd.] 
confidd mé quod velim facile 4 té impetratirum (Fam. xi. 16. 1), I trust I 
shall easily obtain from you what I wish. [Direct: quod vold, impe- 
trabo.] 
Norr.—These verbs, however, often take a simple Complementary Infinitive (§ 456) 
So regularly in early Latin (except spéré):—1 
pollicentur obsidés dare (B. G. iv. 21), they promise to give hostages. 
promisi ddlium vini dare (Pl. Cist. 542), I promised to give ajar of wine.

ad, Some verbs and expressions may be used either as verbs of 
saying, or as verbs of commanding, effecting, and the like. These 
take as their object either an Infinitive with subject accusative or a 
Substantive clause of Purpose or Result, according to the sense. 
1. Infinitive with Subject Accusative (Indirect Discourse) : — 
laudem sapientiae statud esse maximam (Fam. v. 13), I hold that the glory of 
wisdom is the greatest. [Indirect Discourse.] 
rés ipsa monébat tempus esse (Att. x. 8. 1), the thing itself warned that it 
was time. [C£. monére ut, warn to do something. ] 
fac mihi esse persudsum (N. D. i. 75), suppose that I am persuaded of that. 
(Cf. facere ut, bring it about that.] 
hdc volunt persuddére, non interire animds (B. G. vi. 14), they wish to con- 
vince that souls do not perish. 
2, Subjunctive (Substantive Clause of Purpose or Result): — 
statuunt ut decem milia hominum mittantur (B. G. vii. 21), they resolve that 
10,000 men shall be sent. [Purpose clause (cf. § 563).] 
huic persuddet uti ad hostis transeat (id. iii. 18), he persuades him to pass 
over to the enemy. 
Pompéius suis praedixerat ut Caesaris impetum exciperent (B. C. iii. 92), 
Pompey had instructed his men beforehand to await Cesar’s attack. 
dénintiavit ut essent animd parati (id. iii. 86), he bade them be alert and 
steadfast (ready in spirit). 
Nors. — The infinitive with subject accusative in this construction is Indirect Dis- 
course, and is to be distinguished from the simple infinitive sometimes found with these 
verbs instead of a subjunctive clause (§ 563. d). 
  581. The Subject Accusative of the Infinitive is regularly ex- 
pressed in Indirect Discourse, even if it is wanting in the direct: 
orator sum, I am an orator ; dicit sé esse dratdrem, he says he is an orator. 
Norx 1.— But the subject is often omitted if easily understood : — 
igndscere impriidentiae dixit (B. G. iv. 27), he said he pardoned their rashness. 
eadem ab aliis quaerit: reperit esse véra (id. i. 18), he inquires about these same 
things from others ; he finds that they are true. 
Norr 2.— After a relative, or quam (than), if the verb would be the same as that of 
the main clause, it is usually omitted, and its subject is attracted into the accusative: — 
té suspicor eisdem rébus quibus mé ipsum commoyéri (Cat. M. 1), I suspect that 
you are disturbed by the same things as I. 
cdnfidd tamen haec quoque tibi ndn minus grata quam ipsés librés futiira (Plin. 
Ep. iii. 5. 20), I trust that these facts too will be no less pleasing to you than 
the books themselves. 
Nore 3.—In poetry, by a Greek idiom, a Predicate Noun or Adjective in the indi- 
rect discourse sometimes agrees with the subject of the main verb: — 
vir bonus et sapiéns ait esse paratus (Hor. Ep. i.7. 22), a good and wise man says 
he is prepared, etc. [In prose: ait sé esse paratum.] 
sénsit medids délapsus in hostis (Aen. ii. 877), he found himself fallen among the 
foe. [In prose: sé esse délapsum.]
-P-A-G-E-389
§§ 582, 583] INDIRECT DISCOURSE : 377 
  582. When the verb of saying etc. is passive, the construction 
may be either Personal or Impersonal. But the Personal con- 
struction is more common and is regularly used in the tenses of 
incomplete action: — 
beaté vixisse videor (Lael. 15), I seem to have lived happily. 
Epaminondas fidibus praeclaré cecinisse dicitur (Tuse. i. 4), Zpaminondas is 
said to have played excellently on the lyre. 
multi idem factiiri esse dicuntur (Fam. xvi. 12. 4), many are said to be about 
to do the same thing. [Active: dicunt multis factirds (esse). ] 
primi triduntur arte quadam verba vinxisse (Or. 40), they first are related to 
have joined words with a certain skill. 
Bibulus audiébatur esse in Syria (Att. v. 18), 7¢ was heard that Bibulus was in 
Syria (Bibulus was heard, etc.). [Direct: Bibulus est. ] 
e&terae Illyrici legidnés seciitiirae spérabantur (Tac. H. ii. 74), the rest of the 
legions of Illyricum were expected to follow. 
vidémur enim quiétiri fuisse, nisi essémus lacessiti (De Or. ii. 280), it seems 
that we should have kept quiet, if we had not been molested (we seem, etc.). 
[Direct : quiéssémus . . . nisi ess@mus lacessiti. ] 
Nors. — The poets and later writers extend the personal use of the passive to verbs 
which are not properly verba sentiendi ete.: as, —colligor dominae placuisse (Ov. Am. 
ii, 6. 61), é¢ is gathered [from this memorial] that I pleased my mistress. 
a, In the compound tenses of verbs of saying etc., the impersonal 
construction is more common, and with the gerundive is regular : — 
traditum est etiam Homérum caecum fuisse (Tusc. y. 114), dé is a tradition, 
too, that Homer was blind. 
ubi tyrannus est, ibi ndn vitidsam, sed dicendum est plané nfillam esse rem 
piblicam (Rep. iii. 43), where there is a tyrant, it must be said, not that 
the commonwealth is evil, but that it does not exist at all. 
Nore. — An indirect narrative begun in the personal construction may be continued 
with the Infinitive and Accusative (as De Or. ii. 299; Liv. v. 41. 9). 
_ Subordinate Clauses in Indirect Discourse 
583. A Subordinate Clause merely explanatory, or containing 
statements which are regarded as true independently of the quo- 
tation, takes the Indicative: — 
quis neget haec omnia quae vidémus dedrum potestite administrari (Cat. iii. 
21), who can deny that all these things we see are ruled by the power of 
the gods? 
ue ingenid putabat ea quae gesserat posse celebrari (Arch. 20), by whose 
genius he thought that those deeds which he had done could be celebrated. 
[Here the fact expressed by quae gesserat, though not explanatory, is 
felt to be true without regard to the quotation: quae gessisset would 
mean, what Marius claimed to have done.]

  878 SYNTAX: SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES [S§§ 588, 584 
Nore.—Such a clause in the indicative is not regarded as a part of the Indirect 
Discourse; but it often depends merely upon the feeling of the writer whether he shall 
use the Indicative or the Subjunctive (cf. §§ 591-593). 
a. A subordinate clause in Indirect Discourse occasionally takes 
the Indicative when the fact is emphasized : — 
factum éius hostis periculum . . . cum, Cimbris et Teutonis . . . pulsis, ndn 
minérem laudem exercitus quam ipse imperator meritus vidébatur (B. G. 
i. 40), that a trial of this enemy had been made when, on the defeat of the 
' Cimbri and Teutoni, the army seemed to have deserved no less credit than 
. the commander himself. 
b. Clauses introduced by a relative which is equivalent to a 
demonstrative with a conjunction are not properly subordinate, and 
hence take the Accusative and Infinitive in Indirect Discourse (see 
§ 308. f): — 
Marcellus requisisse dicitur Archimédem illum, quem cum audisset inter- 
fectum permolesté tulisse (Verr. iv. 131), Marcellus is said to have sought 
Sor Archimedes, and when he heard that he was slain, to have been greatly 
distressed. [quem = et eum.] 
cénsent finum quemque nostrum mundi esse partem, ex qud [= et ex ed] 
illud natiira consequi (Fin. iii. 64), they say that each one of us is a part 
of the universe, from which this naturally follows. 
Nore. — Really subordinate clauses occasionally take the accusative and infinitive: 
as,—quem ad modum si non dédatur obses prd ruptd foedus sé habitirum, sic déditam 
inviolatam ad suds remissiirum (Liv. ii. 13), [he says] as in case the hostage is not 
given up he shall consider the treaty as broken, so if given up he will return her 
unharmed to her friends. 
ec. The infinitive construction is regularly continued after a com- 
parative with quam : — 
addit sé prius occisum iri ab e6 quam mé violatum iri (Att. ii. 20. 2), he adds 
that he himself will be killed by him, before I shall be injured. 
nonne adfirmavi quidvis mé potius perpessirum quam ex Italia exitiram 
(Fam. ii. 16. 3), did I not assert. that I would endure anything rather 
than leave Italy ? 
Nore. — The subjunctive with or without ut also occurs with quam (see § 535. c). 
Tenses of the Infinitive in Indirect Discourse 
584. The Present, the Perfect, or the Future Infinitive!is used 
in Indirect Discourse, according as the time indicated is present, 
past, or future with reference to the verb of saying ete. by which 
the Indirect Discourse is introduced : —

cadébam, I was falling; cecidi, I fell, have fallen; 
cecideram, I had fallen. 
dicit sé cecidisse, he says he was falling, fell, has fallen, had fallen. 
dixit sé cecidisse, he said he fell, had fallen.

ceciderd, I shall have fallen. 
dicit fore ut ceciderit [rare], he says he shall have fallen. 
dixit fore ut cecidisset [rare], he said he should have fallen. 
a, All varieties of past time are usually expressed in Indirect 
Discourse by the Perfect Infinitive, which may stand for the Imper- 
fect, the Perfect, or the Pluperfect Indicative of the Direct. 
Norr.— Continued or repeated action in past time is sometimes expressed by the 
Present Infinitive, which in such cases stands for the Imperfect Indicative of the Direct 
Discourse and is often called the Imperfect Infinitive. 
This is the regular construction after memini when referring to a matter of actual 
experience or observation: as, —té memini haec dicere, I remember your saying this 
(that you said this). [Direct: dixisti or dicébas.] 
b. The present infinitive posse often has a future sense : — 
totius Galliae sésé potiri posse spérant (B. G. i. 3), they hope that they shall 
be able to get possession of all Gaul. 
Tenses of the Subjunctive in Indirect Discourse 
585. The tenses of the Subjunctive in Indirect Discourse fol- 
low the rule for the Sequence of Tenses (§ 482). They depend for 
their sequence on the verb of saying etc. by which the Indirect 
Discourse is introduced. 
Thus in the sentence, dixit sé Rémam itiirum ut cdnsulem vidéret, he said he 
should go to Rome in order that he might see the consul, vidéret follows the sequence 
of dixit without regard to the Future Infinitive, itirum [esse], on which it directly 
depends, 
Nor. — This rule applies to the subjunctive in subordinate clauses, to that which 
stands for the imperative ete. (see examples, § 588), and to that in questions (§ 586). 
a. A subjunctive depending on a Perfect Infinitive is often in the 
Imperfect or Pluperfect, even if the verb of saying etc. is in a pri- 
mary tense (cf. § 485. 7); so regularly when these tenses would have 
been used in Direct Discourse ; —

Tarquinium dixisse ferunt tum exstlantem sé intelléxisse quis fidis amicds 
habuisset (Lael. 53), they tell us that Tarquin said that then in his exile 
hehad found out what faithful friends he had had. [Here the main verb 
of saying, ferunt, is primary, but the time is carried back by dixisse and 
intelléxisse, and the sequence then becomes secondary. ] 
tantum profécisse vidémur ut 4 Graecis né verborum quidem copia vincerémur 
(N. D. i. 8), we seem to have advanced so far that even in abundance of 
words we are not surpassed by the Greeks. 
Nore 1.—The proper sequence may be seen, in each case, by turning the Perfect 
Infinitive into that tense of the Indicative which it represents. Thus, if it stands for 
an imperfect or an historical perfect, the sequence will be secondary; if it stands for 
a perfect definite, the sequence may be either primary or secondary (§ 485. a). 
Nore 2.— The so-called imperfect infinitive after memini (§ 584. a. N.) takes the 
secondary sequence: as,—ad mé adire quésdam memini, qui dicerent (Fam. iii. 10. 6), J 
remember that some persons visited me, to tell me, etc. 
b. The Present and Perfect Subjunctive are often used in depend- 
ent clauses of the Indirect Discourse even when the verb of saying 
etc. is in a secondary tense : — 
dicébant . . . totidem Nervids (pollicéri) qui longissimé absint (B. G. ii. 4), 
they said that the Nervii, who live farthest off, promised as many. 
Not. — This construction comes from the tendency of language to refer all time 
in narration to the time of the speaker (repraesentatio). In the course of a long pas- 
sage in the Indirect Discourse the tenses of the subjunctive often vary, sometimes fol- 
lowing the sequence, and sometimes affected by repraesentatid. Examples may be 
seen in B. G. i. 13, vii. 20, ete. 
Certain constructions are never affected by repraesentatio. Such are the Imperfect 
and Pluperfect Subjunctive with cum temporal, antequam, and priusquam, 
Questions in Indirect Discourse 
586. A Question in Indirect Discourse may be either in the 
Subjunctive or in the Infinitive with Subject Accusative. 
A real question, asking for an answer, is generally put in the 
Subjunctive ; a rhetorical question, asked for effect and implying 
its own answer, is put in the Infinitive: — 
quid sibi vellet ? ciir in suds possessiGnés veniret (B. G. i. 44), what did he 
want? why did he come into his territories? [Real question. Direct: 
quid vis ? cir venis ?] 
num recentium inifiridrum memoriam [sé] dépdnere posse (id. 1. 14), could 
he lay aside the memory of recent wrongs? [Rhetorical Question. 
Direct: num possum ?] 
quem signum datirum fugientibus ? quem ausirum Alexandro succédere (Q. C. 
iii. 5. 7), who will give the signal on the retreat? who will dare succeed 
Alexander? [Rhetorical. Direct: quis dabit . . . audébit.] 
 
-P-A-G-E-393
§§ 586-589] COMMANDS IN INDIRECT DISCOURSE 381 
Nore '1.—No sharp line can be drawn between the Subjunctive and the Infinitive in questions in the Indirect Discourse. Whether the question is to be regarded as rhetorical or real often depends merely on the writer’s point of view: — 
utrum partem régni petitirum esse, an totum éreptiirum (Liv. xlv. 19. 15), will you 
ask part of the regal power (he said), or seize the whole? 
quid tandem praetori faciendum fuisse (id. xxxi. 48), what, pray, ought a pretor to 
have done? 
quid repente factum [esse] ciir, etc. (id. xxxiv. 54), what had suddenly happened, 
that, etc.? 
Norx 2.— Questions coming immediately after a verb of asking are treated as Indi- 
rect Questions and take the Subjunctive (see § 574). This is true even when the verb 
of asking serves also to introduce a passage in the Indirect Discourse. ‘The question 
may be either real or rhetorical. See quaesivit, etc. (Liv. xxxvii. 15). 
For the use of tenses, see § 585. 
587. A Deliberative Subjunctive (§ 444) in the Direct Dis- 
course is always retained in the Indirect : — 
cir aliqués ex suis amitteret (B. C. i. 72), why (thought he) should he lose 
some of his men? [Direct: cir amittam ?] 
Commands in Indirect Discourse 
588. All Imperative forms of speech take the Subjunctive in 
Indirect Discourse : — 
reminiscerétur veteris incommodi (B. G. i. 18), remember (said he) the ancient 
disaster. [Direct: reminiscere.] 
finem faciat (id. i. 20), let him make an end. [Direct: fac.] 
ferrent opem, adiuvarent (Liv. ii. 6), let them bring aid, let them help. 
a. This rule applies not only to the Imperative of the direct dis- 
course, but to the Hortatory and the Optative Subjunctive as well. 
Nore 1.— Though these subjunctives stand for independent clauses of the direct 
discourse, they follow the rule for the sequence of tenses, being in fact dependent on 
the verb of saying etc. (cf. §§ 483, 585). * 
Nore 2.— A Prohibition in the Indirect Discourse is regularly expressed by né with 
the present or imperfect subjunctive, even when ndli with the infinitive would be used 
in the Direct: as,—né perturbarentur (B. G. vii. 29), do not (he said) be troubled. 
(Direct: nélite perturbari. But sometimes ndllet is found in Indirect Discourse.] 
  Conditions in Indirect Discourse 
589. Conditional sentences in Indirect Discourse are expressed 
as follows: — 
1. The Protasis, being a subordinate clause, is always in the 
Subjunctive. 
2. The Apodosis, if independent and not hortatory or optative, 
is always in some form of the Infinitive. 
 
-P-A-G-E-394
  882 SYNTAX: SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES [§ 589 
a. The Present Subjunctive in the apodosis of less vivid future 
conditions (§ 516.) becomes the Future Infinitive like the Future 
Indicative in the apodosis of more vivid future conditions. 
Thus there is no distinction between more and less vivid future 
conditions in the Indirect Discourse. 
Examples of Conditional Sentences in Indirect Discourse are — 
1. Simple Present Condition (§ 515):— 
(dixit) si ipse popul Rdmand non praescriberet quem ad modum su6 itire 
iterétur, ndn oportére sésé 4 populd Rdman6 in sus itire impediri (B. G. 
i. 86), he said that if he did not dictate to the Roman people how they 
should use their rights, he ought not to be interfered with by the Roman 
people in the exercise of his rights. [Direct: si ndn praescribd .. . non 
oportet. | 
praedicavit . . . si pice fiti velint, iniquum esse, etc. (id. i. 44), he asserted 
that if they wished to enjoy peace, it was unfair, etc. [Direct: si volunt 
. est. Present tense kept by repraesentatid (§ 585. b. n.).] 
2. Simple Past Condition (§ 515): — 
ndn dicam né illud quidem, si maximé in culpa fuerit Apolldnius, tamen in 
hominem honestissimae civitatis honestissimum tam graviter animad- 
verti, causa indicta, non oportuisse (Verr. v. 20), I will not say this 
either, that, even if Apollonius was very greatly in fault, still an honorable 
man from an honorable state ought not to have been punished so severely 
without having his case heard. ([Direct: si fuit . . . non oportuit.] 
8. Future Conditions (§ 516): — 
(dixit) quod si praetered ném6 sequatur, tamen sé cum sdla decima legidne 
itirum (B. G. i. 40), but if nobody else should follow, still he would go 
with the tenth legion alone. [Direct: si sequétur... ibd. Present tense 
by repraesentatio (§ 585. 6. N.).] 
Haeduis sé obsidés redditiirum non esse, neque eis. . . bellum illatirum, si 
in ed manérent, quod convénisset, stipendiumque quotannis penderent : 
si id non fécissent, longé eis fraternum ndmen populi Romani afuti- 
rum (id. i. 36), he said that he would not give up the hostages to the 
Haedui, but would not make war upon them if they observed the agreement 
which had been made, and paid tribute yearly ; but that, if they should 
not do this, the name of brothers to the Roman people would be far from 
aiding them. [Direct: reddam... inferam...si manébunt . . . pen- 
dent: si ndn fécerint . . . aberit.] 
id Datamés ut audivit, sénsit, si in turbam exisset ab homine tam necessa- 
rid sé relictum, futirum [esse] ut céteri consilium sequantur (Nep. Dat. 
6), when Datames heard this, he saw that, if it should get abroad that he 
had been abandoned by a man so closely connected with him, everybody 
else would follow his example. [Direct: si exierit . . . sequentur.]

(putavérunt) nisi mé civitate expulissent, obtinére sé ndn posse licentiam

out of the state, they could not have free play for their desires. [Direct: 
nisi (Cicerdnem) expulerimus, obtinére ndn poterimus. ] 
b. In changing a Condition contrary to fact (§ 517) into the Indi- 
rect Discourse, the following points require notice : — 
1. The Protasis always remains unchanged in tense. 
2. The Apodosis, if active, takes a peculiar infinitive form, made by com- 
bining the Participle in -irus with fuisse. 
8. If the verb of the Apodosis is passive or has no supine stem, the pe- 
riphrasis futirum fuisse ut (with the Imperfect Subjunctive) must be used. 
4, An Indicative in the Apodosis becomes a Perfect Infinitive. 
Examples are : — 
nec sé superstitem filiae futiirum fuisse, nisi spem ulciscendae mortis éius 
in auxilid commiliténum habuisset (Liv. iii. 50. 7), and that he should 
not now be a survivor, etc., unless he had had hope, etc. [Direct: non

would not be hers, if she were not held by this government. [Direct:

(Q. C. vi. 10. 18), what enmities do you think I should have incurred, if 
IT had wantonly assailed the innocent? [excépissem . . . si lacessissem. ] 
invitum sé dicere, nec dictirum fuisse, ni caritds rei piiblicae vinceret (Liv. 
ii. 2), that he spoke unwillingly and should not have spoken, did not love 
Sor the state prevail. [Direct: nec dixissem . . . ni vinceret.]

most people thought that unless at that time reports of Cesar’s victory 
had been brought, the town would have been lost. [Direct: nisi essent 
allati. . . dmissum esset.] 
quorum si aetas potuisset esse longinquior, futirum fuisse ut omnibus. per-

been longer, human existence would have been embellished by every art in 
its perfection. [Direct: si potuisset . . . érudita esset.] 
at plérique existimant, si acrius insequi voluisset, bellum ed dié potuisse 
finire (B. C. iii. 51), but most people think that, if he had chosen to follow 
up the pursuit more vigorously, he could have ended the war on that day. 
[Direct : si voluisset . . . potuit.] 
Caesar respondit . . . si aliciius initiriae sibi conscius fuisset, ndn fuisse dif- 
ficile cayére (B. G. i. 14), Caesar replied that if [the Roman people] had 
been aware of any wrong act, it would not have been hard for them to take 
precautions. [Direct: si fuisset, non difficile fuit (§ 517. ¢).]

Norx 1.—In Indirect Discourse Present Conditions contrary to fact are not dis- 
tinguished in the apodosis from Past Conditions contrary to fact, but the protasis may 
keep them distinct. 
Nors 2.— The periphrasis futiirum fuisse ut is sometimes used from choice when 
there is no necessity for resorting to it, but not in Cesar or Cicero. 
Norz 3. — Very rarely the Future Infinitive is used in the Indirect Discourse to ex- 
press the Apodosis of a Present Condition contrary to fact. Only four or five examples 
of this use occur in classic authors: as, — Titurius clamabat si Caesar adesset neque 
Carnutés, etc., neque Eburdnés tanta cum contemptidne nostra ad castra ventiirds esse 
(B, G. v. 29), Titurius cried out that if Cxsar were present, neither would the Car- 
nutes, etc., nor would the Eburones be coming to our camp with such contempt.

Informal Indirect Discourse 
592. A Subordinate Clause takes the Subjunctive when it 
expresses the thought of some other person than the writer or 
speaker : — 
1. When the clause depends upon another containing a wish, a 
command, or a question, expressed indirectly, though not strictly in 
the form of Indirect Discourse ; — 
animal sentit quid sit quod deceat (Off. i. 14), an animal feels what it is that 
is fit. 
huic imperat quas possit adeat civitatés (B. G. iv. 21), he orders him to visit 
what states he can. 
hune sibi ex animé scriipulum, qui sé diés noctisque stimulat ac pungit, ut 
évellatis postulat (Rosc. Am. 6), he begs you to pluck from his heart this 
doubt that goads and stings him day and night. [Here the relative 
clause is not a part of the Purpose expressed in évellatis, but is an 
assertion made by the subject of postulat.] 
2. When the main clause of a quotation is merged in the verb of 
saying, or some modifier of it : — 
si quid dé his rébus dicere vellet, féci potestatem (Cat. fii. 11), if he wished 
to say anything about these matters, I gave him a chance. 
tulit dé caede quae in Appia vid facta esset (Mil. 15), he passed a law con- 
cerning the murder which (in the language of the bill) took place in the 
Appian Way. 
nisi restituissent statuds, yehementer minatur (Verr. ii. 162), he threatens them 
violently unless they should restore the statues. [Here the main clause, 
“that he will inflict punishment,”’ is contained in minatur.] 
iis auxilium suum pollicitus si ab Suébis premerentur (B. G. iv. 19), he 
promised them his aid if they should be molested by the Suevi. [= polli- 
citus sé auxilium latirum, etc.] 
prohibitid tollendi, nisi pactus esset, vim adhibébat pactidni (Verr. iii. 37), 
the forbidding to take away unless he came to terms gave force to the 
bargain. 
3. When a reason or an explanatory fact is introduced by a rela- 
tive or by quod (rarely quia) (see § 540): — 
Paetus omnis librds qués frater suus reliquisset mihi d6navit (Att. ii. 1. 12), 
Petus presented to me all the books which (he said) his brother had left. 
Norn. — Under this head even what the speaker himself thought under other cir- 
eumstances may have the Subjunctive. So also with quod even the verb of saying may 
be in the Subjunctive (§ 540, n.2). Here belong also non quia, non quod, introducing a 
reason expressly to deny it. (See § 540. n. 3.)

Subjunctive of Integral Part (Attraction)

as an integral part of that clause : —} 
imperat, dum rés ifdicétur, hominem adservent: cum itdicata sit, ad sé ut 
addiicant (Verr. iii. 55), he orders them, till the affair should be decided, 
to keep the man; when it is judged, to bring him to him. 
etenim quis tam dissoliitd animé est, qui haec cum videat, tacére ac neglegere 
possit (Rosc. Am. 82), for who is so reckless of spirit that, when he sees 
these things, he can keep silent and pass them by ? 
més est Athénis laudari in contidne eds qui sint in proeliis interfecti (Or. 
151), it is the custom at Athens for those to be publicly eulogized who 
have been slain in battle. [Here laudari is equivalent to ut laudentur. ] 
a. But adependent clause may be closely connected grammatically 
with a Subjunctive or Infinitive clause, and still take the Indicative, 
if it is not regarded as a necessary logical part of that clause : — 
quédam modé postulat ut, quem ad modum est, sic etiam appellétur, tyrannus 
(Att. x. 4.2), in @ manner he demands that as he is, so he may be called, 
a tyrant. 
natira fert ut eis faveamus qui eadem pericula quibus nés perfincti sumus 
ingrediuntur (Mur. 4), nature prompts us to feel friendly towards those 
who are entering on the same dangers which we have passed through. 
né hostés, quod tantum multitidine poterant, suds circumvenire possent 
(B.. G. ii. 8), lest the enemy, because they were so strong in numbers, should 
be able to surround his men. 
si mea in té essent officia sdlum tanta quanta magis 4 té ipsd praedicari 
quam 4 mé ponder§ri solent, verécundius 4 té . . . peterem (Fam. ii. 6), 
if my good services to you were only so great as they are wont rather to 
be called by you than to be estimated by me, I should, etc. 
Nore 1.— The use of the Indicative in such clauses sometimes serves to emphasize 
the fact, as true independently of the statement contained in the subjunctive or infini- 
tive clause. But in many cases no such distinction is perceptible. 
Nore 2.—It is often difficult to distinguish between Informal Indirect Discourse 
and the Integral Part. Thus in imperavit ut ea fierent quae opus essent, essent may 
stand for sunt, and then will be Indirect Discourse, being a part of the thought, but 
not a part of the order; or it may stand for erunt, and then will be Integral Part, being 
a part of the order itself. ‘The difficulty of making the distinction in such cases is 
evidence of the close relationship between these two constructions. 
1 The subjunctive in this use is of the same nature as the subjunctive in the main 
clause. A dependent clause in a clause of purpose is really a part of the purpose, as 
is seen from the use of should and other auxiliaries in English. Ina result clause this 
is less clear, but the result construction is a branch of the characteristic (§ 534), to 
which category the dependent clause in this case evidently belongs when it takes the 
subjunctive.

A noun used to describe another, and denoting the same person or 
thing, agrees with it in Case (§ 282). 
. Adjectives, Adjective Pronouns, and Participles agree with their 
nouns in Gender, Number, and Case (§ 286). 
. Superlatives (more rarely Comparatives) denoting order and succes- 
sion—also medius, (céterus), reliquus— usually designate not what 
object, but what part of it, is meant (§ 293). 
. The Personal Pronouns have two forms for the genitive plural, that 
in -um being used partitively, and that in -i oftenest objectively 
(§ 295. b). 
. The Reflexive Pronoun (sé), and usually the corresponding possessive 
(suus), are used in the predicate to refer to the subject of the sen- 
tence or clause (§ 299). 
. To express Possession and similar ideas the Possessive Pronouns 
must be used, not the genitive of the personal or reflexive pro- 
nouns (§ 802. a). 
A Possessive Pronoun or an Adjective implying possession may take 
an appositive in the genitive case agreeing in gender, number, and 
case with an implied noun or pronoun (§ 302. e). 
A Relative Pronoun agrees with its Antecedent in Gender and Num- 
ber, but its Case depends on its construction in the clause in 
which it stands (§ 305). 
. A Finite Verb agrees with its Subject in Number and Person (§ 316). 
Adverbs are used to modify Verbs, Adjectives, and other Adverbs 
(§ 821). 
A Question of simple fact, requiring the answer yes or no, is formed 
by adding the enclitic -ne to the emphatic word (§ 332). 
When the enclitic -ne is added to a negative word, —as in ndnne, — 
an affirmative answer is expected. The particle num suggests a 
negative answer (§ 382. b). 
The Subject of a finite verb is in the Nominative (§ 339). 
The Vocative is the case of direct address (§ 340). 
A noun used to limit or define another, and not meaning the same 
person or thing, is put in the Genitive (§ 342). 
The Possessive Genitive denotes the person or thing to which an 
object, quality, feeling, or action belongs (§ 343).

The genitive may denote the Substance or Material of which a 
thing consists (§ 344). 
The genitive is used to denote Quality, but only when the quality is 
modified by an adjective (§ 345). 
Words denoting a part are followed by the Genitive of the whole to 
which the part belongs (Partitive Genitive, § 846). 
Nouns of action, agency, and feeling govern the Genitive of the object 
(Objective Genitive, § 348). 
Adjectives denoting desire, knowledge, memory, fulness, power, sharing, 
guilt, and their opposites ; participles in -ns when used as adjectives; © 
and verbals in -ax, govern the Genitive (§ 349. a, 0, c). 
Verbs of remembering and forgetting take either the Accusative or 
the Genitive of the object (§ 350). 
Verbs of reminding take with the Accusative of the person a Genitive 
of the thing (§ 351). 
Verbs of accusing, condemning, ard acquitting take the Genitive of 
the charge or penalty (§ 352). 
The Dative is used of the object indirectly affected by an action 
(indirect Object, § 361). 
. Many verbs signifying to favor, help, please, trust, and their contraries ; 
also, to believe, persuade, command, obey, serve, resist, envy, threaten, 
pardon, and spare, take the Dative (§ 367). 
Many verbs compounded with ad, ante, con, in, inter, ob, post, prae, 
pro, sub, super, and some with circum, admit the Dative of the 
indirect object (§ 370). 
The Dative is used with esse and similar words to denote Possession 
(§ 378). 
The Dative of the Agent is used with the Gerundive, to denote the 
person on whom the necessity rests (§ 874). 
The Dative often depends, not on any particular word, but on the 
general meaning of the sentence (Dative of Reference, § 376). 
Many verbs of taking away and the like take the Dative (especially 
of a person) instead of the Ablative of Separation (§ 381). 
The Dative is used to denote the Purpose or End, often with another 
Dative of the person or thing affected (§ 382). 
The Dative is used with adjectives (and a few adverbs) of fitness, 
nearness, likeness, service, inclination, and their opposites (§ 384),

An intransitive verb often takes the Accusative of a noun of kindred 
meaning, usually modified by an adjective or in some other man- 
ner (Cognate Accusative, § 390). 
Verbs of naming, choosing, appointing, making, esteeming, showing, and 
the like, may take a Predicate Accusative along with the direct 
object (§ 393). 
Transitive verbs compounded with prepositions sometimes take (in 
addition to the direct object) a Secondary Object, originally goy- 
erned by the preposition (§ 394). 
Some verbs of asking and teaching may take two Accusatives, one of 
the Person, and the other of the Thing (§ 396). 
The subject of an Infinitive is in the Accusative (§ 397. e). 
Duration of Time and Extent of Space are expressed by the Accusa- 
tive ($§ 424. ¢, 425). 
Words signifying separation or privation are followed by the Abla- 
tive (Ablative of Separation, § 400). 
The Ablative, usually with a preposition, is used to denote the source 
from which anything is derived or the material of which it consists 
(§ 403). 
The Ablative, with or without a preposition, is used to express cause 
(§ 404). 
The Voluntary Agent after a passive verb is expressed by the Abla- 
tive with 4 or ab (§ 405). 
The Comparative degree is often followed by the Ablative signifying 
than (§ 406). 
The Comparative may be followed by quam, than. When quam is 
used, the two things compared are put in the same case (§ 407). 
47. The Ablative is used to denote the means or instrument of an action 
48. 
49. 
50. (§ 409). 
The deponents, itor, fruor, fungor, potior, and véscor, with several of 
their compounds, govern the Ablative (§ 410). 
Opus and isus, signifying need, are followed by the Ablative (§ 411). 
The manner of an action is denoted by the Ablative, usually with 
cum unless a limiting adjective is used with the noun (§ 412).

Accompaniment is denoted by the Ablative, regularly with cum 
(§ 418). 
With Comparatives and words implying comparison the Ablative is 
used to denote the degree of difference (§ 414). 
The quality of a thing is denoted by the Ablative with an adjective 
or genitive Modifier (§ 415). 
The price of a thing is put in the Ablative (§ 416). 
The Ablative of Specification denotes that in respect to which any- 
thing is or is done (§ 418). 
The adjectives dignus and indignus take the Ablative (§ 418. b). 
A noun or pronoun, with a participle in agreement, may be put in 
the Ablative to define the time or circumstances of an action 
(Ablative Absolute, § 419). 
An adjective, or a second noun, may take the place of the participle in the 
ablative absolute construction (§ 419. a). 
Time when, or within which, is denoted by the Ablative; time how 
long by the Accusative (§ 423). 
Relations of Place are expressed as follows : — 
1. The place from which, by the Ablative with ab, dé, ex. 
2. The place to which (or end of motion), by the Accusative with 
ad or in. 
8. The place where, by the Ablative with in (Locative Ablative). 
(§ 426.) 
With names of towns and small islands, and with domus and riis, the 
relations of place are expressed as follows : — 
1. The place from which, by the Ablative without a preposition. 
2. The place to which, by the Accusative without a preposition. 
3. The place where, by the Locative. (§ 427.) 
The Hortatory Subjunctive is used in the present tense to express 
an exhortation, a command, or a concession (§§ 439, 440). 
The Optative Subjunctive is used to express a wish. The present 
tense denotes the wish as possible, the imperfect as unaccomplished 
in present time, the pluperfect as wnaccomplished in past time 
(§ 441). 
The Subjunctive is used in questions implying (1) doubt, indignation, 
or (2) an impossibility of the thing’s being done (Deliberative Sub- 
Junetive, § 444).

The Potential Subjunctive is used to suggest an action as possible or 
conceivable (§ 446). 
The Imperative is used in commands and entreaties (§ 448). 
Prohibition is regularly expressed in classic prose (1) by n6li with the 
Infinitive, (2) by cavé with the Present Subjunctive, (8) by né with 
the Perfect Subjunctive (§ 450). 
The Infinitive, with or without a subject accusative, may be used 
with est and similar verbs (1) as the Subject, (2) in Apposition with 
the subject, or (3) as a Predicate Nominative (§ 452). 
Verbs which imply another action of the same subject to complete their 
meaning take the Infinitive without a subject accusative (Comple- 
mentary Infinitive, § 456). 
The Infinitive, with subject accusative, is used with verbs and other 
expressions of knowing, thinking, telling, and perceiving (Indirect 
Discourse, see § 459). 
The Infinitive is often used for the Imperfect Indicative in narration, 
and takes a subject in the Nominative (Historical Infinitive, § 463). 
Sequence or Tenses. In complex sentences, a primary tense in 
the main clause is followed by the Present or Perfect Subjunctive 
in the dependent clause; a secondary tense by the Imperfect or 
Pluperfect (§ 483). 
Participles denote time as present, past, or future with respect to the 
time of the verb in their clause (§ 489). 
The Gerund and the Gerundive are used, in the oblique cases, in 
many of the constructions of nouns (§§ 501-507). 
The Supine in -um is used after verbs of motion to express Purpose 
(§ 509). 
The Supine in -i is used with a few adjectives and with the nouns 
fas, nefas, and opus, to denote Specification (§ 510). 
Dum, modo, dummodo, and tantum ut, introducing a Proviso, take 
the Subjunctive (§ 528). 
Final clauses take the Subjunctive introduced by ut (uti), negative 
né (ut né), or by a Relative Pronoun or Relative Adverb (§ 531). 
A Relative Clause with the Subjunctive is often used to indicate a 
characteristic of the antecedent, especially where the antecedent is 
otherwise undefined (§ 535). 
Dignus, indignus, aptus, and idéneus, take a Subjunctive clause with 
a relative (rarely with ut) (§ 535. f).
-P-A-G-E-404
      392 SYNTAX: IMPORTANT RULES [g§ 594 
80. Clauses of Result take the Subjunctive introduced by ut, so that 
(negative, ut ndn), or by a Relative Pronoun or Relative Adverb 
(§ 587). 
81. The Causal Particles quod, quia, and quoniam take the Indicative 
when the reason is given on the authority of the writer or speaker ; 
the Subjunctive when the reason is given on the authority of 
another (§ 540). 
82. The particles postquam (postedquam), ubi, ut (ut primum, ut semel), 
simul atque (simul ac, or simul alone) take the Indicative (usually 
in the perfect or the historical present) (§ 543). 
83. A Temporal clause with cum, when, and some past tense of the Indica- 
tive dates or defines the time at which the action of the main verb 
occurred (§ 545). 
84. A Temporal clause with cum and the Imperfect or Pluperfect Sub- 
junctive describes the circumstances that accompanied or preceded 
the action of the main verb (§ 546). 
85. Cum Causal or Concessive takes the Subjunctive (§ 549). 
For other concessive particles, see § 527. 
86. In Indirect Discourse the main clause of a Declaratory Sentence is 
put in the Infinitive with Subject Accusative. All subordinate 
clauses take the Subjunctive (§ 580). 
87. The Present, the Perfect, or the Future Infinitive is used in Indirect 
Discourse, according as the time indicated is present, past, or future 
with reference to the verb of saying etc. by which the Indirect Dis- 
course is introduced (§ 584). 
88. In Indirect Discourse a real question is generally put in the Subjunc- 
tive; a rhetorical question in the Infinitive (§ 586). 
89. All Imperative forms of speech take the Subjunctive in Indirect 
Discourse (§ 588). 
90. A Subordinate clause takes the Subjunctive when it expresses the 
thought of some other person than the writer or speaker (Informal 
Indirect Discourse, § 592). 
91. A clause depending on a Subjunctive clause or an equivalent Infini- 
tive will itself take the Subjunctive if regarded as an integral part 
of that clause (Attraction, § 593). 
For Prepositions and their cases, see §§ 220, 221. 
For Conditional Sentences, see §512ff. (Scheme in § 514.) 
For ways of expressing Purpose, see § 533.

  §§ 595-597] ORDER OF WORDS : 393 
ORDER OF WORDS 
595. Latin differs from English in having more freedom in the 
arrangement of words for the purpose of showing the relative 
importance of the ideas in a sentence. 
596. As in other languages, the Subject tends to stand first, the 
Predicate last. Thus,— 
Pausanias Lacedaemonius magnus hom6 sed varius in omni genere vitae fuit 
(Nep. Paus. 1), Pausanias the Lacedemonian was a great man, but in- 
consistent in the whole course of his life. 
Norr.— This happens because, from the speaker’s ordinary point of view, the sub- 
ject of his discourse is the most important thing in it, as singled out from all other 
things to be spoken of. 
a. There is in Latin, however, a special tendency to place the verb itself 
last of all, after all its modifiers. But many writers purposely avoid the 
monotony of this arrangement by putting the verb last but one, followed 
by some single word of the predicate. 
597. In connected discourse the word most prominent in the 
speaker’s mind comes first, and so on in order of prominence. 
This relative prominence corresponds to that indicated in Eng- 
lish by a graduated stress of voice (usually called emphasis). 
a. The difference in emphasis expressed by difference in order of words 
is illustrated in the following passages : — 
apud Xenophdntem autem moriéns Cyrus maior haec dicit (Cat. M. 79), 1x 
XxEnopnon too, on his death-bed Cyrus the elder utters these words. 
C¥rus quidem haec moriéns ; nds, si placet, nostra videdmus (id. 82), Cyrus, 
to be sure, utters these words on his death-bed ; let us, if you please, con- 
sider our own case. 
Cyrus quidem apud Xenophdntem ed serméne, quem moriéns habuit (id. 
80), Cyrus, to be sure, in Xenophon, in that speech which he uttered on 
his death-bed. 
Norr.—This stress or emphasis, however, in English does not necessarily show 
any violent contrast to the rest of the words in the sentence, but is infinitely varied, 
constantly increasing and diminishing, and often so subtle as to be unnoticed except 
in careful study. So, as a general rule, the precedence of words in a Latin sentence 
is not mechanical, but corresponds to the prominence which a good speaker would 
mark by skilfully managed stress of voice. A Latin written sentence, therefore, has 
all the clearness and expression which could be given to a spoken discourse by the best 
actor in English. Some exceptions tq the rule will be treated later. 
The first chapter of Ceesar’s Gallic War, if rendered so as to bring 
out as far as possible thie shades of emphasis, would run thus :—

from the Belgians by the Marne and 
Seine. Of ruese 13 (rripes) the brav- 
est of all14 are the Belgians, for the 
reason that they live farthest ® away 
1 GAUL: emphatic as the subject of discourse, as with a title or the like. 
2 Divided: opposed to the false conception (implied in the use of omnis) that the 
country called Gallia by the Romans is one. This appears more clearly from the fact 
that Cesar later speaks of the Galli in a narrower sense as distinct from the other two 
tribes, who with them inhabit Gallia in the wider sense. 
8 Parts: continuing the emphasis begun in divisa. Not three parts as opposed to 
any other number, but into parts at all. 
4 Inhabited: emphatic as the next subject, “The inhabitants of these parts are, etc.” 
5 One: given more prominence than it otherwise would have on account of its close 
connection with quarum. 
6 Another, etc.: opposed to one. 
1 Their own, ours: strongly opposed to each other. 
8 TuxEsk (tribes): the main subject of discourse again, collecting under one head 
the names previously mentioned. 
9 Language, etc.: these are the most prominent ideas, as giving the striking points 
which distinguish the tribes. The emphasis becomes natural in English if we say 
“these have a different language, different institutions, different laws.” 
10 All of them: the emphasis on ai] marks the distributive character of the adjec- 
tive, as if it were ‘‘every one has its own, etc.” 
11GAULS: emphatic as referring to the Gauls proper in distinction from the other 
tribes. 
12 Separated: though this word contains an indispensable idea in the connection, yet 
it has a subordinate position. It is not emphatic in Latin, as is seen from the fact that 
it eannot be made emphatic in English. The sense is: The Gauls lie between the 
Aquitani on the one side, and the Belgians on the other. 
18 Of THESE: the subject of discourse. 
44 All: emphasizing the superlative idea in ‘‘ bravest”’; they, as Gauls, are assumed 
to be warlike, but the most so of all of them are the Belgians. 
1 Farthest away: one might expect absunt (are away) to have a more emphatic 
place, but it is dwarfed in importance by the predominance of the main idea, the effemi- 
nating influences from which the Belgians are said to be free. It is not that they live 
Sarthest off that is insisted on, but that the civilization of the Province ete., which 
would soften them, comes less in their way. It is to be noticed also that absunt has 
already been anticipated by the construction of culti and still more by longissimé, so 
that when it comes it amounts only to a formal part of the sentence. Thus,— “‘ because 
the civilization ete. of the Province (which would soften them) is farthest from them.”

quent) importation of such things as ® 
tend to soften* their warlike spirit ; 
and are also nearest 5 to the Germans, 
who live across the Rhine,® and with 
whom they are incessantly? at war. 
For the same reason the HELvETIANs, as 
well, are superior to all the other Gauls 
in valor, because they are engaged in 
almost daily battles with the Germans, 
either defending their own boundaries 
from them, or themselves making war 
on those of the Germans. Of aL THis 
country, one part—the one which, 
as has been said, the Gauls (proper) 
occupy — BEeGins at the river Rhone. 
Its boundaries are the river Garonne, 
the ocean, and the confines of the Bel- 
gians. It even rEacuEs on the side 
of the Sequani and Helvetians the river 
Rhine. Its general direction is towards 
the north. The Brterans begin at 
the extreme limits of Gaul; they reach 
(on this side) as far as the lower part 
of the Rhine. ORDER OF WORDS 895

b. The more important word is never placed last for emphasis. The 
apparent cases of this usage (when the emphasis is not misconceived) are 
cases where a word is added as an afterthought, either real or affected, and 
-so has its position not in the sentence to which it is appended, but, as it 
were, in a new one. 
1 Least: made emphatic here by a common Latin order, the chiasmus (§ 598. f). 
2 Traders: the fourth member of the chiasmus, opposed to culti and himanitate, 
8 Such things as: the importance of the nature of the importations overshadows the 
fact that they are imported, which fact is anticipated in traders. 
4 Soften: cf. what is said in note 15, p. 394. They are brave because they have 
less to soften them, their native barbarity being taken for granted. 
5 Nearest: the same idiomatic prominence as in note 1 above, but varied by a special 
usage combining chiasmus and anaphora (§ 598. f). 
6 Across the Rhine: i.e. and so are perfect savages. 
7 Incessantly: the continuance of the warfare becomes the all-important idea, as 
if it were ‘“‘and not a day passes in which they are not at war with them.”

  396 ORDER OF WORDS [gs 598 
598. The main rules for the Order of Words are as follows : — 
a. In any phrase the determining and most significant word comes 
first : — 
1. Adjective and Noun: — 
omnis hominés decet, every man ought (opposed to some who do not). 
Licius Catilina ndbili genere natus fuit, magna vi et animi et corporis, 
sed ingenid mal6 pravdque (Sall. Cat. 5), Lucius Catiline was born of a 
nosie family, with arnat force of mind and body, but with a natuRE 
that was evil and depraved. [Here the adjectives in the first part are 
the emphatic and important words, no antithesis between the nouns 
being as yet thought of; but in the second branch the noun is meant 
to be opposed to those before mentioned, and immediately takes the 
prominent place, as is seen by the natural English emphasis, thus mak- 
ing a chiasmus.1] 
2. Word with modifying case : — 
quid magis Epamin6ndam, Thébandrum imperatdrem, quam victériae Thé- 
pandrum consulere decuit (Inv. i. 69), what should Epaminondas, com- 
mander of the Turpans, have aimed at more than the victory of the 
Thebans? 
lacrima nihil citius aréscit (id. i. 109), nothing dries quicker than a THAR. 
ném6 feré laudis cupidus (De Or. i. 14), hardly any one desirous of guory 
(cf. Manil. 7, avidi laudis, nacur for glory). 
b. Numeral adjectives, adjectives of quantity, demonstrative, relative, 
. and interrogative pronouns and adverbs, tend to precede the word or words 
to which they belong: — 
cum aliqua perturbatidne (Off. i. 187), with somn disturbance. 
hic tind praestamus (De Or. i. 32), in ru1s one thing we excel. 
céterae feré artés, the ornER arts. 
Notr.—This happens because such words are usually emphatic; but often the 
words connected with them are more so, and in such cases the pronouns eic. yield the 
emphatic place: — 
causa aliqua (De Or. i. 250), some cAsE. 
stilus ille tuus (id. i. 257), that well-known stYLE of yours (in an antithesis; see 
passage). [Ile is idiomatic in this sense and position.] 
Rémam quae apportata sunt (Verr. iy. 121), what were carried to RomE (in contrast 
to what remained at Syracuse). 
ce. When sum is used as the Substantive verb (§ 284. 6), it regularly 
stands first, or at any rate before its subject : — 
est viri magni piinire sontis (Off. i. 82), it is the duty of a great man to pun- 
ish the guilty. 
1 So called from the Greek letter X (chi), on account of the criss-cross arrangement 
of the words. Thus, tes (see f below). 
 
-P-A-G-E-409
  § 598] ORDER OF WORDS 397 
d. The verb may come first, or have a prominent position, either (1) 
because the idea in it is emphatic; or (2) because the predication of the 
whole statement is emphatic; or (3) the tense only may be emphatic : — 
(1) dicébat idem Cotta (Off. ii. 59), Cotta used to say the same thing (opposed 
to others’ boasting). 
idem fécit aduléscéns M. Antonius (id. ii. 49), the same thing was ponx by 
Mark Antony in his youth. [Opposed to dixi just before.] 
facis amicé (Lael. 9), you acr kindly. [Cf. amicé facis, you are very KIND 
(you act KINDLY). ] 
(2) propénsior benignitas esse débébit in calamitdsés nisi forte erunt digni 
calamitate (Off. ii. 62), liberality ought to be readier toward the unfortu- 
nate unless perchance they REALLY DESERVE their misfortune. 
praesertim cum scribat (Panaetius) (id. iii. 8), especially when he DoES say 
(in his books). [Opposed to something omitted by him.] 
(8) fuimus Troes, fuit ium (Aen. ii. 825),we have cuasen to be Trojans, Troy 
is now no MORE. 
loquor autem dé comminibus amicitiis (Off. iii. 45), but I am spraxine Now 
of common friendships. 
e. Often the connection of two emphatic phrases is brought about by 
giving the precedence to the most prominent part of each and leaving the 
less prominent parts to follow in inconspicuous places : — 
pliirés solent esse causae (Off. i. 28), there are USUALLY SEVERAL reasons. 
quiés amisimus civis, eds Martis vis perculit (Mare. 17), waar fellow-citizens 
we have Lost, have been stricken down by the violence of war. 
maximas tibi omnés gratids agimus (id. 33), we atu render you the WARMEST 
thanks. 
haec rés tinius est propria Caesaris (id. 11), ru1s exploit belongs to Cesar 
ALONE. 
obiiirgationés etiam ndn numquam incidunt necessariae (Off. i. 186), occa- 
SIONS FOR REBUKE also somETIMES occur which are unavoidable. 
f. Antithesis between two pairs of ideas is indicated by placing the pairs 
either (1) in the same order (anaphora) or (2) in exactly the opposite order 
(chiasmus) : — 
(1) rérum copia verborum cdpiam gignit (De Or. iii. 125), anunDANCE of MAT- 
TER produces COPIOUSNESS Of EXPRESSION. 
(2) légés supplicid improbés afficiunt, défendunt ac tuentur bonds (Legg. ii. 
13), the laws vis1r PUNISHMENTS upon the wicKED, but the coop they 
DEFEND and PROTECT. 
Norr.—Chiasmus is very common in Latin, and often seems in fact the more inarti- 
ficial construction. In an artless narrative one might hear, ‘‘The women were all 
drowned, they saved the men.” 
non igitur utilitatem amicitia sed itilitas amicitiam cdnseciita est (Lael. 51), it is 
not then that friendship has followed upon advantage, but advantage upon 
Sriendship. [Here the chiasmus is only grammatical, the ideas being in the 
parallel order.] (See also p. 395: longissimé, minimé, proximi.)
-P-A-G-E-410
  398 ORDER OF WORDS [$$ 598, 599 
g- A modifier of a phrase or some part of it is often embodied within 
the phrase (cf. a): — 
dé communi hominum memoria (Tuse. i. 59), in regard to the UNIVERSAL 
memory of man. 
h. A favorite order with the poets is the interlocked, by which the attri- 
bute of one pair comes between the parts of the other (synchysis) : — 
et superiectd pavidae natarunt aequore dammae (Hor. Od. i. 2. 11). 
Notr.— This is often joined with chiasmus: as,—arma ndndum expiatis incta 
erudribus (id. ii. 1. 5). 
4. Frequently unimportant words follow in the train of more emphatic 
ones with which they are grammatically connected, and so acquire a promi- 
nence out of proportion to their importance : — 
dictitabat sé hortulds aliqués emere velle (Off. iii. 58), he gave out that he 
wanted to buy some gardens. [Here aliqués is less emphatic than emere, 
but precedes it on account of the emphasis on hortulés.] 
Jj. The copula is generally felt to be of so little importance that it may 
come in anywhere where it sounds well; but usually under cover of more 
emphatic words : — 
consul ego quaesivi, cum vos mihi essétis in cdnsilid (Rep. iii. 28), as consul 
I held an investigation in which you attended me in council. 
falsum est id totum (id. ii. 28), that is all false. 
k. Many expressions have acquired an invariable order: — 
rés publica; populus Rdmanus ; hondris caus&; pace tanti viri. 
Notre.— These had, no doubt, originally an emphasis which required such an 
arrangement, but in the course of time have changed their shade of meaning. Thus, 
sendtus populusque Romanus originally stated with emphasis the official bodies, but 
became fixed so as to be the only permissible form of expression. 
  %. The Romans had a fondness for emphasizing persons, so that a name 
or a pronoun often stands in an emphatic place : — 
[dixit] véndlis quidem sé hortds non habére (Off. iii. 58), [said] that he did n't 
have any gardens for sale, to be sure. 
m. Kindred words often come together (figura etymologica) : — 
ita sénsim sine sénsii aetds senéscit (Cat. M. 38), thus gradually, without 
being perceived, man’s life grows old. 
Special Rules 
599. The following are special rules of arrangement: — 
a. The negative precedes the word it especially affects; but if it belongs 
to no one word in particular, it generally precedes the verb; if it is espe- 
cially emphatic, it begins the sentence. (See example, 598. f. N.)
-P-A-G-E-411
  §§ 599-601] STRUCTURE OF THE PERIOD 399 
b. Itaque regularly comes first in its sentence or clause; enim, autem, 
vérd, quoque, never first, but usually second, sometimes third if the second 
word is emphatic; quidem never first, but after the emphatic word; igitur 
usually second; né... quidem include the emphatic word or words. 
¢. Inquam, inquit, are always used parenthetically, following one or more 
words. So often créd6, opinor, and in poetry sometimes precor. 
d. (1) Prepositions (except tenus and versus) regularly precede their 
nouns; (2) but a monosyllabic preposition is often placed between a noun 
and its adjective or limiting genitive : — 
» quem ad modum; quam ob rem; m4gnd cum metii; omnibus cum cépiis; 
nulla in ré (cf. § 598. i). 
e. In the arrangement of clauses, the Relative clause more often comes 
first in Latin, and usually contains the antecedent noun : — 
qués dmisimus civis, eds Martis vis perculit (Marc. 17), those citizens whom 
we have lost, etc. 
f. Personal or demonstrative pronouns tend to stand together in the 
sentence : — 
cum vos mihi essétis in cdnsilid (Rep. iii. 28), when you attended me in 
counsel. 
Structure of the Period 
600. Latin, unlike modern languages, expresses the relation of words to each other 
by inflection rather than by position. Hence its structure not only admits of great 
variety in the arrangement of words, but is especially favorable to that form of sen- 
tence which is called a Period. In a period, the sense is expressed by the sentence as a 
whole, and is held in suspense till the delivery of the last word. 
An English sentence does not often exhibit this form of structure. It was imitated, 
sometimes with great skill and beauty, by many of the earlier writers of English prose; 
but its effect is better seen in poetry, as in the following passage :— 
High on a throne of royal state, which far 
Outshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind, 
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand 
Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold, 
Satan exalted sat.— Paradise Lost, ii. 1-5. 
But in argument or narrative, the best English writers more commonly give short 
clear sentences, each distinct from the rest, and saying one thing by itself. In Latin, 
on the contrary, the story or argument is viewed as a whole; and the logical relation 
among all its parts is carefully indicated. 
601. In the structure of the Period, the following rules are to 
be observed : — 
a. In general the main’ subject or object is put in the main clause, not 
in a subordinate one: — 
Hannibal cum recénsuisset auxilia Gadés profectus est (Liv. xxi. 21), when 
Hannibal had reviewed the auxiliaries, he set out for Cadiz.

  400 ORDER OF WORDS : [§ 601 
Volsci exiguam spem in armis, alia undique abscissa, cum tentdssent, prae- 
ter cétera adversa, locd quoque iniqué ad pignam congressi, iniquidre 
ad fugam, cum ab omni parte caederentur, ad precés 4 certamine versi 
dédits imperatdre traditisque armis, sub iugum missi, cum singulis 
vestimentis, ignodminiae cladisque pléni dimittuntur (Liv. iv. 10). [Here 
the main fact is the return of the Volscians. But the striking circum- 
stances of the surrender etc., which in English would be detailed in a 
number of brief independent sentences, are put into the several subor- 
dinate clauses within the main clause so that the passage gives a com- 
plete picture in one sentence. ] 
  b. Clauses are usually arranged in the order of prominence in the mind 
of the speaker; so, usually, cause before result; purpose, manner, and the 
like, before the act. 
c. In codrdinate clauses, the copulative conjunctions are frequently 
omitted (asyndeton). In such cases the connection is made clear by some 
antithesis indicated by the position of words. 
d. A change of subject, when required, is marked by the introduction 
of a pronoun, if the new subject has already been mentioned. But such 
change is ‘often purposely avoided by a change in structure,—the less 
important being merged in the more important by the aid of participles 
or of subordinate phrases : — 
quem ut barbari incendium effiigisse vidérunt, télis minus missis inter- 
fécérunt (Nep. Ale. 10), when the barbarians saw that he had escaped, 
rvHeEY threw darts at u1m at long range and killed um. 
celeriter confecté negotid, in hiberna legidnés rediixit (B. G. vi. 8), the mat- 
ter was soon finished, anv he led the legions, ete. 
e. So the repetition of a noun, or the substitution of a pronoun for it, 
is avoided unless a different case is required : — 
dolorem si non potuer6 frangere occultab6 (Phil. xii. 21), if I cannot conquer 
the pain, I will hide rr. [CE£. if I cannot conquer I will hide the pain.] 
f. The Romans were careful to close a period with an agreeable succes- 
sion of long and short syllables. Thus, — 
quod scis nihil prodest, quod nescis multum obest (Or. 166), what you know 
is of no use, what you do not know does great harm. 
Nore. —In rhetorical writing, particularly in oratory, the Romans, influenced by 
their study of the Greek orators, gave more attention to this matter than in other 
forms of composition. Quintilian (ix. 4. 72) lays down the general rule that a clause 
should not open with the beginning of a verse or close with the end of one.

  §§ 602, 603] QUANTITY OF VOWELS 401 . 
PROSODY 
QUANTITY 
602. The poetry of the Indo-European people seems originally to have been some- 
what like our own, depending on accent for its metre and disregarding the natural 
quantity of syllables. The Greeks, however, developed a form of poetry which, like 
music, pays close attention to the natural quantity of syllables; and the Romans bor- 
rowed their metrical forms in classical times from the Greeks. Hence Latin poetry 
does not depend, like ours, upon accent and rhyme; but is measured, like musical 
strains, by the length of syllables. Especially does it differ from our verse in not 
regarding the prose accent of the words, but substituting for that an entirely differ- 
ent system of metrical accent or ictus (see § 611. a). This depends upon the character 
of the measure used, falling at regular intervals of time on a long syllable or its equiva- 
lent. Each syllable is counted as either long or short in Quantity ; and a long syllable 
is generally reckoned equal in length to two short ones (for exceptions, see § 608. c-e). 
The quantity of radical (or stem) syllables—as of short a in p&ter or of long a in 
m&ter—can be learned only by observation and practice, unless determined by the 
general rules of quantity. Most of these rules are only arbitrary formulas devised to 
assist the memory; the syllables being long or short because the ancients pronounced 
them so. The actual practice of the Romans in regard to the quantity of syllables is 
ascertained chiefly from the usage of the poets; but the ancient grammarians give some 
assistance, and in some inscriptions long vowels are distinguished in various ways, — 
by the apex, for instance, or by doubling (§ 10. e. N.). 
Since Roman poets borrow very largely from the poetry and ayaa of the 
Greeks, numerous Greek words, especially proper names, make an important part of 
Latin poetry. These words are generally employed in accordance with the Greek, 
and not the Latin, laws of quantity. Where these laws vary in any important point, 
the variations will be noticed in the rules below. 
GENERAL RULES 
603. The following are General Rules of Quantity (ef. §§ 9-11): 
Quantity of Vowels 
a. Vowels. A vowel before another vowel or h is short: as, via, trahd. 
Exceptions. —1. In the genitive form -ius, i is long: as, utrius, nillius. It 
is, however, sometimes short in verse (§ 118. c). 
2. In the genitive and dative singular of the fifth declension, e is long between 
two vowels: as, diéi; otherwise usually short, as in fidéi, réi, spéi. 
Nor. — It was once long in these also: as, plénu® fidéi (Ennius, at the end of a hex- 
ameter). A is also long before i in the old genitive of the first declension: as, aulai. 
38. In the conjugation of fid, i is long except when followed by er. Thus, fid, 
fiébam, fiam, but fieri, fierem ; so also fit (§ 606. a. 8). 
4. In many Greek words the vowel in Latin represents a long vowel or diph- 
thong, and retains its original long quantity: as, Troes (Tpdes), Thalia (OaNeia), 
hérdas (jpwas), aér (dnp).
-P-A-G-E-414
  402 ’ PROSODY: QUANTITY [§ 808 
Norg.—But many Greek words are more or less Latinized in this respect: as, 
Académia, choréa, Maléa, platéa, 
5. In dius, in éheu usually, and sometimes in Diana and dhe, the first vowel is 
long. 
b. Diphthongs. A Diphthong is long: as, f0edus, cui,’ aula. 
Exception. —The preposition prae in compounds is generally shortened before 
a vowel: as, praé-ustis (Aen. vii. 524), praé-eunte (id. v. 186). 
Norx.—U following q, s, or g, does not make a diphthong with a following vowel 
(see § 5. N. 2). For 4-i6, mA-ior, pé-ior, etc., see § 11. d and N. 
c. Contraction. A vowel formed by contraction (crasis) is long: as, nil, 
from nihil; cdgd for tco-agd ; malo for ma-vold. 
Nore. — Two vowels of different syllables may be run together without full con- 
traction (synizésis, § 642): as, déinde (for deinde), meds (for meds); and often two 
syllables are united by Synzresis (§ 642) without contraction: as when piriétibiis is 
pronounced paryétibus. 
d. A vowel before ns, nf, gn, is long: as, inst6, infans, signum. 
Quantity of Syllables 
e. A syllable is long if it contains a long vowel or a diphthong: as, 
c&-rus, 6-men, foe-dus. ; 
f. Position. A syllable is long by position if its vowel, though short, is 
followed by two consonants or a double consonant: as, adventus, cortex. 
But if the two consonants are a mute followed by 1 or r the syllable may 
be either long or short (common) ; as, alacris or alacris; patris or patris. 
Vowels should be pronounced long or short in accordance with their nat- 
ural quantity without regard to the length of the syllable by position. 
Nors 1.— The rules of Position do not, in general, apply to final vowels before a 
word beginning with two consonants. 
Nor 2.—A syllable is long if its vowel is followed by consonant i (except in 
biiugis, quadriiugis) : see § 11. d. 
Nore 3.— Compounds of iacié, though written with one i, commonly retain the 
long vowel of the prepositions with which they are compounded, as if before a con- 
sonant, and, if the vowel of the preposition is short, the first syllable is long by posi- 
tion on the principle of § 11. e. 
obicis hosti (at the end of a hexameter, Aen. iv. 549). 
inicit et salti (at the beginning of a hexameter, Aen. ix. 552). 
Proice téla manii (at the beginning of a hexameter, Aen. vi. 836). 
Later poets sometimes shorten the preposition in trisyllabic forms, and preposi, 
tions ending in a vowel are sometimes contracted as if the verb began with a vowel: 
(1) cir an|nds Sbi|cis (Claud. iv C. H. 264). 
(2) réicé c&|pellas (Ecl. iii. 96, at end). 
Norn 4.— The y or w sound resulting from synwresis (§ 642) has the effect of a con- 
sonant in making position: as, abietis (abyetis), fluyidrum (fluvyorum). Conversely, 
when the semivowel becomes a vowel, position is lost: as, siliiae, for silyae,   
1 Rarely dissyllabic citi (as Mart. i. 104. 22).
-P-A-G-E-415
  § 604] FINAL SYLLABLES . 403 
FINAL SYLLABLES 
604. The Quantity of Final Syllables is as follows: — 
a. Monosyllables ending in a vowel are long: as, mé, ti, hi, né. 
1. The attached particles -n&, -qué, -vé, -cé, -pt®, and ré- (réd-) are short; sé- 
(séd-) and di- arelong. Thus, sécédit, séditis, exercitumqué rédiicit, dimittd. But

cir, én, non, quin, sin — with adverbs in c: as, hic, hii¢, sic—are long. 
d. Final a in words declined by cases is short, except in the ablative sin- 
gular of the first declension ; in all other words final a is long. Thus, e& 
stelld (nominative), cum ea stella (ablative); friistra, voc (imperative), 
posted, triginta. 
Exceptions. —éi&, iti, quik, puta (suppose); and, in late use, triginta etc. 
e. Final e is short: as in niibé, diicité, saepé. 
Exceptions. — Final e is long —1. In adverbs formed from adjectives of the 
first and second declension, with others of like form : as, alté, longé, miseré, aperté, 
saepissimé. So feré, fermé. 
But it is short in ben&, mal& ; infernt, supern®. 
2. In nouns of the fifth declension: as, fidé (also famé), facié, hodié, quaré 
(qua ré). 
3. In Greek neuters plural of the second declension: as, cété; and in some 
other Greek words: Phoebé, Circé, Andromaché, etc. 
4, In the imperative singular of the second conjugation : as, vidé. 
But sometimes cavé, hab’, tact, valé, vidé (cf. § 629. b. 1). 
f. Final iis long: as in turri, fili, audi. 
Exceptions. — Final i is common in mihi, tibi, sibi, ibi, ubi; and short in nisi, 
quasi, sicuti, cui (when making two syllables), and in Greek vocatives: as, Alexi. 
g- Final 0 is common: but long in datives and ablatives; also in nouns 
of the third declension. It is almost invariably long in verbs before the 
time of Ovid. 
Exceptions. — cits, modd (dummodd), imm%, profectd, egd, dud, ced (the impera- 
tive); so sometimes oct#, ilicd, etc., particularly in later writers. 
h. Final u is long. Final y is short.

2. es is short in the nominative of nouns of the third declension (lingual) hay- 
ing a short vowel in the stem!?: as, mil&s (-itis), obsés (-Idis), — except abiés, ariés, 
pariés, pés; in the present of esse (és, adés) ; in the preposition penés, and in the 
plural of Greek nouns: as, hérd&s, lampadés. 
8. os is short in compis, impis ; in the Greek nominative ending: as, barbitis ; 
in the old nominative of the second declension: as, servis (later servus). 
4. is in plural cases is long: as in bonis, nobis, vobis, omnis (accusative plural). 
6. is is long in the verb forms fis, sis, vis (with quivis etc.), velis, malis, ndlis, 
edis ; in the second person singular of the present indicative active in the fourth 
conjugation: as, audis ; and sometimes in the forms in -eris (future perfect indica- 
tive or perfect subjunctive). 
6. us is long in the genitive singular and nominative, accusative, and vocative 
plural of the fourth declension ; and in nouns of the third declension haying @ 
(long) in the stem: as, virtis (-itis), inciis (-idis). But peciis, -iidis. 
Jj» Of other final syllables, those ending in a single consonant are short. 
Thus, am&t, amatiir; donéc, fc, prociil, iubar. 
Exceptions. —hic (also hic); alléc; the ablatives illdc, etc.; certain adverbs in 
-C: a8, illic, istic; lién, and some Greek nouns: as, aér, aethér, cratér. 
Perfects and Perfect Participles 
605. Perfects and Perfect Participles of two syllables have the 
first syllable long: as, iavi, iitum (itivd), vidi, visum (vided); figi 
(fiigid); véni (vénid). 
Exceptions. —bibi, dédi, fidi, scidi, st&ti, stiti, tili; citum, ditum, itum, litum, 
quitum, ritum, riitum, sdtum, situm, stitum. In some compounds of std, statum 
is found (long), as praestatum. 
a. In reduplicated perfects the vowel of the reduplication is short; the 
vowel of the following syllable is, also, usually short: as, cécidi (c4d6), 
didici (disc), piiptigi (pung6), ciictirri (curré), téténdi (tend), mémérdi (mor- 
ded). But cécidi from caed6, pepédi from pédé. 
Derivatives 
606. Rules for the Quantity of Derivatives are: — 
a. Forms from the same stem have the same quantity: as, 4m6, 4ma- 
visti; génus, géneris. 
Exceptions. —1. bis, lar, mas, par, pés, sal, —also arbds, — have a long vowel 
in the nominative, though the stem-vowel is short (cf. genitive bivis etc.). 
1 The quantity of the stem-vowel may be seen in the genitive singular.

  §§ 606, 607] RHYTHM 405 
2. Nouns in -or, genitive -dris, have the vowel shortened before the final r: as, 
hondr. (But this shortening is comparatively late, so that in early Latin these 
nominatives are often found long.) 
3. Verb-forms with vowel originally long regularly shorten it before final m, 
1, ort: as, amém, amér, dicerér, amét (compare amémus), dicer&t, audit, fit. 
Nors. — The final syllable in t of the perfect was long in old Latin, but is short in 
the classic period. 
4. A few long stem-syllables are shortened: as, acer, Acerbus. So dé-itrd and 
pé-iéxd, weakened from iiiz6. 
6. Forms from the same root often show inherited variations of yowel 
quantity (see § 17): as, dicé (cf. maledicus) ; diicd (diix, diicis) ; fid6 (perfidus) ; 
vox, Vocis (vicd); léx, légis (1ég5). 
e. Compounds retain the quantity of the words which compose them: 
as, oc-cidd (c&dd), oc-cid6 (caedd), in-iquus (aequus). 
Norr.— Greek words compounded with zpé have 0 short: as, prophéta, proldgus. 
Some Latin compounds of pré have o short: as, prdficiscor, profiteor. Compounds with 
ne vary: as, néfas, négd, néqued, néquam. 
RHYTHM 
607. The essence of Rhythm in poetry is the regular recurrence of syllables 
pronounced with more stress than those intervening. To produce this effect in its 
perfection, precisely equal times should occur between the recurrences of the stress. 
But, in the application of rhythm to words, the exactness of these intervals is sacri- 
ficed somewhat to the necessary length of the words; and, on the other hand, the 
words are forced somewhat in their pronunciation, to produce more nearly the proper 
intervals of time. In different languages these adaptations take place in different 
degrees; one language disregarding more the intervals of time, another the pronun- 
ciation of the words.. 
The Greek language early developed a very strict rhythmical form of poetry, in 
which the intervals of time were all-important. The earliest Latin, on the other hand, 
—as in the Saturnian and Fescennine verse, — was not so restricted. But the purely 
metrical forms were afterwards adopted from the Greek, and supplanted the native 
forms of verse. Thus the Latin poetry with which we have to do follows for the most 
part Greek rules, which require the formal division of words (like music) into measures 
of equal times, technically called Feet. The strict rhythm was doubtless more closely 
followed in poetry that was sung than in that which was declaimed or intoned. In 
neither language, however, is the time perfectly preserved, even in single measures ; 
and there are some cases in which the regularity of the time between the ictuses is 
disturbed. 
The Greeks and Romans distinguished syllables of two kinds in regard to the time 
required for their pronunciation, a long syllable haying twice the metrical value of a 
short one. But it must not be supposed that all long syllables were of equal length, 
or even that in a given passage each long had just twice the length of the contiguous 
shorts. The ratio was only approximate at best, though necessarily more exact in 
singing than in recitation. Nor are longs and shorts the only forms of syllables that 
are found. In some eases a long syllable was protracted, so as to have the time of 
three or even of four shorts, and often one long or two shorts were pronounced in less 
than their proper time, though they were perhaps distinguishable in time from one
-P-A-G-E-418
  406 PROSODY: RHYTHM [§§ 607, 608 
short (see § 608. c, d). Sometimes a syllable naturally short seems to have been 
slightly prolonged, so as to represent a long, though in most (not all) cases the appar- 
ent irregularity can be otherwise explained. In a few cases, also, a pause takes the 
place of one or more syllables to fill out the required length of the measure. This 
could, of course, take place only at the end of a word: hence the importance of 
Cesura and Dieresis in prosody (§ 611. 8, ¢). 
Measures 
608. Rhythm consists of the division of musical sound into 
equal intervals of time called Measures or Feet. 
The most natural division of musical time is into measures con- 
sisting of either two or three equal parts. But the ancients also 
distinguished measures of five equal parts. 
Norr.— The divisions of musical time are marked by a stress of voice on one or 
the other part of the measure. This stress is called the Ictus (beat), or metrical accent 
(see § 611. a). 
a. The unit of length in Prosody is one short syllable. This is called 
a Mora. It is represented by the sign U, or in musical notation by the 
eighth note or quaver ¢)- 
b. A long syllable is regularly equal to two more, and is represented 
by the sign —, or by the quarter note or crotchet )- 
c. A long syllable may be protracted, so as to occupy the time of three 
or four more. Such a syllable, if equal to three more, is represented 
by the sign _ (or dotted quarter fe +); if equal to four, by 4 (or the half 
note or minim, i: 
d. A long syllable may be contracted, so as to take practically the time 
of a short one. Such a syllable is sometimes represented by the sign >. 
e. A short syllable may be contracted so as to occupy less than one mora. 
f. A pause sometimes occurs at the end of a verse or a series of verses, 
to fill up the time. A pause of one mora in a measure is indicated by the 
sign A ; one of two more by the sign 1. 
g- One or more syllables are sometimes placed before the proper begin- 
ning of the measure. Such syllables are called an Anacrisis or prelude. 
The anacrusis is regularly equal to the unaccented part of the measure. 
1 The same thing occurs in modern poetry, and in modern music any unaccented 
syllables at the beginning are treated as an anacrusis, i.e. they make an incomplete 
measure before the first bar. This was not the case in ancient music. The ancients 
seem to have treated any unaccented syllable at the beginning as belonging to the fol- 
lowing accented ones, so as to make with them a foot or measure. Thus it would seem 
that there was an original form of Indo-European poetry which was iambic in its 
structure, or which, at least, accented the second syllable rather than the first.

Nore.— Narrative poetry was written for rhythmical recitation, or chant, with 
instrumental accompaniment; and Lyrical poetry for rhythmical melody, or singing. 
It must be borne in mind that in ancient music— which in this differs widely from 
modern —the rhythm of the melody was identical with the rhythm of the text. The 
lyric poetry was to be sung; the poet was musician and composer, as well as author. 
To this day a poet is said conventionally to “sing.” 
Thus a correct understanding of the rhythmical structure of the verse gives us the 
time, though not the twne, to which it was actually sung. The exact time, however, 
as indicated by the succession of long and short syllables, was varied according to 
certain laws of so-called ‘‘ Rhythmic,” as will be explained below. In reading ancient 
verse it is necessary to bear in mind not only the variations in the relative length of 
syllables, but the occasional pause necessary to fill out the measure; and to remember 
that the rhythmical accent is the only one of importance, though the words should be 
distinguished carefully, and the sense preserved. Poetry should not be scanned, but 
read metrically. 
1 Jt seems probable that both thesis and arsis of an irrational foot were affected by 
the necessity of preserving the rhythmical time of the foot.

§§ 610, 611] THE MUSICAL ACCENT 409 
Substitution 
610. In many cases measures.of the same time may be substi- 
tuted for each other, a long syllable taking the place of two short 
ones, or two short syllables the place of a long one. 
In the former case the measure is said to be contracted; in the 
latter, to be resolved : — 
a. A Spondee (_ _) may take the place of a Dactyl (_ u vu) or an 
Anapest (U uv —); and a Tribrach (U U v) may take the place of a 
Trochee (_ v) or an Iambus (U _). The optional substitution of one 
long syllable for two short ones.is represented by the sign cu. 
6. When a long syllable having the Ictus (§ 611. a) is resolved, the 
ictus properly belongs to both the resulting short syllables; but for con- 
venience the mark of accent is placed on the first : — 
nine ex|périar | sftne &|céto | tibi cdr | Acr® in | péctd[ré. — Pl. Bac. 405.

The Musical Accent 
611. That part of the measure which receives the stress of voice 
(the musical accent) is called the Thesis; the unaccented part is 
called the Arsis.? 
a. The stress of voice laid upon the Thesis is called the Ictus (beat). 
Tt is marked thus: 4 U vu. ‘ 
6. The ending of a word within a measure is called Cesura. When 
this coincides with a rhetorical pause, it is called the Cesura of the verse, 
and is of main importance as affecting the melody or rhythm. 
c. The coincidence of the end of a word with that of a measure is 
called Dizresis. 
1 The Thesis signifies properly the putting down (6éo1s, from rlOnu, put, place) of 
the foot in beating time, in the march or dance (‘‘ downward beat’’), and the Arsis the 
raising (&po.s, from delpw, raise) of the foot (‘upward beat”). By the Latin gram- 
marians these terms were made to mean, respectively, the ending and the beginning of 
ameasure. By a misunderstanding which has prevailed till recently, since the time of 
Bentley, their true signification has been reversed. They will here be used in accord- 
ance with their ancient meaning, as has now become more common. This metrical 
accent, recurring at regular intervals of time, is what constitutes the essence of the 
rhythm of poetry as distinguished from prose, and should be constantly kept,in mind. 
The error mentioned arose from applying to trochaic and dactylic verse a definition 
which was true only of iambic or anapestic.

VERSIFICATION 
THE VERSE 
612. A single line of poetry — that is, a series of feet set in a 
recognized order —is called a Verse.? 
Norr. — Most of the common verses originally consisted of two series (hemistichs), 
but the joint between them is often obscured. It is marked in Iambie and Trochaic 
Tetrameter by the Dizresis, in Dactylic Hexameter by the Cesura. 
a. A verse lacking a syllable at the end is called Catalectic, that is, hay- 
ing a pause to fill the measure; when the end syllable is not lacking, the 
yerse is called Acatalectic, and has no such pause. 
b. A final syllable, regularly short, is’sometimes lengthened before a 
pause :? it is then said to be long by Diastole : — 
* nostror” obruimur, —oriturque miserrima caedés. — Aen. ii. 411. 
ec. The last syllable of any verse may be indifferently long or short 
(syllaba anceps). 
Scansion and Elision 
d. To divide the verse into its appropriate measures, according to the 
rules of quantity and versification, is called scanning or scansion (scansid, 
a climbing or advance by steps, from scand6). 
Nore. — In reading verse rhythmically, care should be taken to preserve the meas- 
ure or time of the syllables, but at the same time not to destroy or confuse the words 
themselves, as is often done in scanning. 
e. In scanning, a vowel or diphthong at the end of a word (unless an 
interjection) is partially suppressed when the next word begins with a vowel 
or with h. This is called Elision (bruising).* 
In reading it is usual entirely to suppress elided syllables. Strictly, how- 
ever, they should be sounded lightly. 
1 The word Verse (versus) signifies a turning back, i.e. to begin again in like 
manner, as opposed to Prose (prdrsus or prdversus), which means straight ahead. 
2 This usage is comparatively rare, most cases where it appears to be found being 
caused by the retention of an originally long quantity. 
8 The practice of Elision is followed in Italian and French poetry, and is sometimes 
adopted in English, particularly in the older poets :— 
T” inyeigle and invite th’ unwary sense.— Comus 538. 
In early Latin poetry a final syllable ending in s often loses this letter even before a 
consonant (cf. § 15. 7) :— 
senid confectus’ quiéscit.—Enn, (Cat. M. 14). 
   
-P-A-G-E-423
  §§ 612-615] DACTYLIC HEXAMETER 411 
Nor. —Elision is sometimes called by the Greek name Synalopha (smearing). 
Rarely a syllable is elided at the end of a verse when the next verse begins with a 
vowel: this is called Synapheia (binding). 
f. A final m, with the preceding vowel, is suppressed in like manner 
when the next word begins with a vowel or h: this is called Ecthlipsis 
(squeezing out) : — 
monstr“” horrend””, inform’, ingéns, cui limen adémptum. 
— Aen. iii. 658. 
Nore 1.—Final m has a feeble nasal sound, so that its partial suppression before 
the initial vowel of the following word was easy. 
Nore 2.—The monosyllables 46, dem, spé, spem, sim, std, stem, qui (plural), and 
monosyllabic interjections are never elided; nor is an iambic word elided in dactylic 
verse. Elision is often evaded by skiJful collocation of words. 
g- Elision is sometimes omitted when a word ending in a vowel has a spe- 
cial emphasis, or is succeeded by a pause. This omission is called Hiatus 
(gaping). 
Norr. — The final vowel is sometimes shortened in such cases. 
FORMS OF VERSE 
613. A verse receives its name from its dominant or funda- 
mental foot: as, Dactylic, Iambic, Trochaic, Anapestic; and from 
the number of measures (single or double) which it contains: 
as, Hexameter, Tetrameter, Trimeter, Dimeter. 
Norg.—Trochaic, Iambic, and Anapestic verses are measured not by single feet, 
but by pairs (dipodia), so that six Iambi make a Trimeter. 
614. A Stanza, or Strophe, consists of a definite number of 
verses ranged in a fixed order. 
Many stanzas are named after some eminent poet: as, Sapphic 
(from Sappho), Alcaic (from Alexus), Archilochian (from Archilo- 
chus), Horatian (from Horace), and so on. 
Dactyitic VERSE 
Dactylic Hexameter 
615. The Dactylic Hexameter, or Heroie Verse, consists theo 
retically of six dactyls. It may be represented thus: — 
fuy|tuvultilyyltyvltyy | 
eri ee ities irae Perin tI
-P-A-G-E-424
  412 PROSODY: VERSIFICATION [§ 615 
Norz.—The last foot is usually said to be a spondee, but is in reality a trochee 
standing for a dactyl, since the final syllable is not measured. 
a. For any foot, except the fifth, a spondee may be substituted. 
6. Rarely a spondee is found in the fifth foot; the verse is then called 
spondaic and usually ends with a word of four syllables. 
Thus in Ecl. iv. 49 the verse ends with incrémentum. 
ce. The hexameter has regularly one principal cesura — sometimes two — 
almost always accompanied by a pause in the sense. 
1. The principal cxsura is usually after the thesis (less commonly in the arsis) 
of the third foot, dividing the verse into two parts in sense and rhythm. See 
examples in d. 
2. It may also be after the thesis (less commonly in the arsis) of the fourth foot. 
In this case there is often another cesura in the second foot, so that the verse 
is divided into three parts: — 
partd féjréx |] ar|dénsqué Scti[lfs |] et | sib | c6llX. — Aen. vy. 277. 
Nore. — Often the only indication of the principal among a number of cesuras is 
the break in the sense. 
A cesura occurring after the first syllable of a foot is called masculine. A cxsura 
occurring after the second syllable of a foot is called feminine (as in the fifth foot of 
the third and fourth verses ind). A cesura may also be found in any foot of the verse, 
but a proper cxsural pause could hardly occur in the first or sixth. 
When the fourth foot ends a word, the break (properly a disresis) is sometimes 
improperly called bucolic cesura, from its frequency in pastoral poetry. 
d. The first seven verses of the Hneid, divided according to the fore- 
going rules, will appear as follows. The principal cesura in each verse is 
marked by double lines : — 
Arma vifrumqué c&|nd |} Trojiae qui | primis &b | dris 
Tt&lijam faltd profii|gus || La|vinédqué | venit

Albajniqué pijtrés, [| at|que altae | moeni% | Romae. 
1. The feminine cesura is seen in the following : — 
Dis géni|ti potijéré: || té{nent mé&di]* omnia silvae. — Aen. vi. 181. 
Nore. — The Hexameter is thus illustrated in English verse: — 
Over the sea, past Crete, on the Syrian shore to the southward, 
Dwells in the well-tilled lowland a dark-haired Aithiop people, 
Skilful with needle and loom, and the arts of the dyer and carver, 
Skilful, but feeble of heart; for they know not the lords of Olympus, 
Lovers of men; neither broad-browed Zeus, nor Pallas Athené, 
Teacher of wisdom to heroes, bestower of might in the battle; 
Share not the cunning of Hermes, nor list to the songs of Apollo, 
Fearing the stars of the sky, and the roll of the blue salt water.

  §§ 616, 617] ELEGIAC STANZA 413 
Elegiac Stanza 
616. The Elegiac Stanza consists of two verses, —a Hexame- 
ter followed by a Pentameter.! 
The Pentameter verse is the same as the Hexameter, except that it 
omits the last half of the third foot and of the sixth foot :— 
Lista |e |e NS | aren A us (Zz 
ror rr or a. The Pentameter verse is therefore to be scanned as two half-verses, the 
second of which always consists of two dactyls followed by a single syllable. 
b6. The Pentameter has no regular Cesura; but the first half-verse 
must always end with a word (dicresis, § 611. c), which is followed by a 
pause to complete the measure.? 
e. The following verses will illustrate the forms of the Elegiac Stanza :— 
cum siibit | illilus |] tris|tissima | noctis i{mago

— Ov. Trist. i. 3. 
Norr. —The Elegiac Stanza differs widely in character from hexameter verse (of 
which it is a mere modification) by its division into Distichs, each of which must haye 
its own sense complete. It is employed in a great variety of compositions, — epistolary, 
amatory, and mournful, — and was especially a favorite of the poet Ovid. It has been 
tllustrated in English verse, imitated from the German: — 
In the Hex|ameter | rises || the | fountain’s | silvery | column ; 
In the Pen|tameter | aye || falling in | melody | back. 
Other Dactylic. Verses 
617. Other dactylic verses or half-verses are occasionally used 
by the lyric poets.

feet (two dactyls or spondees, a spondee, and two anapests), as follows: —

Mixrep MEASURES | 
621. Different measures may be combined in the same verse in two different 
ways. Either (1) a series of one kind is simply joined to a series of another kind 
(compare the changes of rhythm not uncommon in modern music) ; or (2) single feet 
of other measures are combined with the prevailing measures, in which case these odd 
feet are adapted by changing their quantity so that they become irrational (see § 609. e). 
When enough measures of one kind occur to form a series, we may suppose a 
change of rhythm; when they are isolated, we must suppose adaptation. Of the 
indefinite number of possible combinations but few are found in Latin poetry. 
622. The following verses, combining different rhythmical 
series, are found in Latin lyrical poetry: — 
1. Greater Archilochian (Dactylic Tetrameter; Trochaic Tripody) : — 
(ete oft col eos dl ae || sélvitiir | Acris hijéms gra|t& vicé || véris | ét Fa|véni.— Hor. Od. i. 4.

Iambic Dimeter : —

Loeaapic VERSE 
623. Trochaic verses, containing in regular prescribed positions 
irrational measures or irrational feet (cf. § 609. e), are called Loga- 
edic. The principal logacedic forms are — 
1. Logacedic Tetrapody (four feet): GLycontc. 
2. Logacdic Tripody (three feet): Puerecratic (often treated as a 
syncopated Tetrapody Catalectic). 3 
8. Logacedic Dipody (two feet): this may be regarded as a am Phere- 
cratic. 
Nors.— This mixture of irrational measures gives an effect approaching that of 
prose: hence the name Logacedic (Aéyos, do.d4). These measures originated in the 
Greek lyric poetry, and were adopted by the Romans. All the Roman lyric metres not 
belonging to the regular iambic, trochaic, dactylic, or Ionic systems, were constructed 
on the basis of the three forms given above: viz., Logawdic systems consisting respec- 
tively of four, three, and two feet. The so-called Logawdic Pentapody consists of five 
feet, but is to be regarded as composed of two of the others.

Nor. —The shorter Pherecratic (dipody) (~u | 4), if catalectic, appears to 
be a simple Choriambus (_v uv |__ A); and, in general, the effect of the logacedic 
forms is Choriambic. In fact, they were so regarded by the later Greek and Latin 
metricians, and these metres have obtained the general name of Choriambic. But 
they are not true choriambic, though they may very likely have been felt to be such 
by the composer, who imitated the forms without much thought of their origin. They 
may be read (scanned), therefore, on that principle. But it is better to read them as 
logaedic measures; and that course is followed here.

all measures in early Latin. The long syllables may be resolved, or the

ec. Cretic measures (§ 609. d. 1) occur in the same manner as the Bac- 
chiac, with the same substitutions. The last foot is usually incomplete : — 
ambr Amiletis mihi | né fiias | dmquim. 
his &go | d® drtibus | gratiam | fiicis. 
nfl &g? is|tés mbror | faéc&ds | mérés. —id. 267, 298, 297. 
d. Saturnian Verse. In early Latin is found a rude form of verse, not 
borrowed from the Greek like the others, but as to the precise nature of 
which scholars are not agreed.t 
1. According to one view the verse is based on quantity, is composed of 
six feet, and is divided into two parts by a cesura before the fourth thesis. 
Each thesis may consist of a long syllable or of two short ones, each arsis 
of a short syllable, a long syllable, or two short syllables; but the arsis, 
except at the beginning of the verse and before the czesura, is often entirely 
suppressed, though rarely more than once in the same verse : — 
d&bint malim Métélli || Naévié pdétae. 
2. According to another theory the Saturnian is made up, without regard 
to quantity, of alternating accented and unaccented syllables; but for any 
unaccented syllable two may be substituted, and regularly are so substituted 
in the second foot of the verse : — 
ddbunt mélum Metélli || Naévié poétae. 
EARLY PROSODY 
629. The prosody of the earlier poets differs in several re- 
spects from that of the later? 
a. At the end of words s, being only feebly sounded, does not make 
position with a following consonant; it sometimes disappeared altogether. 
This usage continued in all poets till Cicero’s time (§ 15. 7). 
1 The two principal theories only are given. There are numerous variations, par- 
ticularly of the second theory here stated. 
2 Before the Latin language was used in literature, it had become much changed 
by the loss of final consonants and the shortening of final syllables under the influence 
of accent. In many cases this change was still in progress in the time of the early 
poets. This tendency was arrested by the study of grammar and by literature, but 
shows itself again in the Romance languages.  
-P-A-G-E-439
  § 629] EARLY PROSODY 427 
b. A long syllable immediately preceded or followed by the ictus may 
be shortened (iambic shortening) : — 
1. Ina word of two syllables of which the first is short (this effect remained in 
a few words like puta, cavé, valé, vidé, egd, mod’, dud 1): — 
Abi (Ter. Ph. 59); béni (id. 516); hdmé sudvis (id. 411). 
2. If it is either a monosyllable or the first syllable of a word which is pre- 
ceded by a short monosyllable : — 
séd his tabellas (Pl. Pers. 195); quid hic nunc (id. Epid. 157) ; pér inpli- 
vium (Ter. Ph. 707); &g° dsténderem (id. 793). 
8. When preceded by a short initial syllable in a word of more than three 
syllables :— 
véntistatis (Ter, Hee. 848); stnécttitem (id. Ph. 434) ; Syriictisis (Pl. Merc. 
87) ; Smicitia (id. Ps. 1263). 
c. In a few isolated words position is often disregarded.?, Such are Ye, 
immo, inde, iste, Smnis, némpe, quippe, tinde. 
d. The original long quantity of some final syllable is retained. 
1. The ending -or is retained long in nouns with long stem-vowel (original r- 
stems or original s-stems) : — 
médo quom dict” in m® ingerébas ddium nén uxér erdm (Pl. Asin. 927). 
fta m? in péctor® dtque cérde facit amor incénditm (id. Mere. 500). 
Atque quintd néx fuisti léngiér hac préxumé (id. Am. 548). 
2, The termination -es (-itis) is sometimes retained long, as in milés, superstés. 
38. All verb-endings in -r, -s, and -t may be retained long where the vowel is 
elsewhere long in inflection : — 
régrediér audisse mé (Pl. Capt. 1023); dtqu® ut quf fueris et qui nunc (id. 
248); mé néminat haec (id. Epid. iv. 1. 8); faciat ut sémper (id. Poen. 
ii. 42); Infuscbat, amabé (cretics, id. Cist. i. 21); qui amét (id. Mere. 
1021) ; ut fit in bélld cépitur Alter filits (id. Capt. 25); tibi sit ad mé 
revisiis (id. Truc. ii. 4. 79). 
e. Hiatus (§ 612. g) is allowed somewhat freely, especially at a pause 
in the sense, or when there is a change of speaker.* 
1 Cf. ambi (also a dual, p. 59, footnote), in which the 6 is retained because of the 
length of the first syllable. 
2 Scholars are not yet agreed upon the principle or the extent of this irregularity. 
8 The extent of this license is still a question among scholars; but in the present 
state of texts it must sometimes be allowed.

Reckoning of Time : 
6380. The Roman Year was designated, in earlier times, by the names of the 
Consuls; but was afterwards reckoned from the building of the City (ab urbe condita, 
anné urbis conditae), the date of which was assigned by Varro to a period correspond- 
ing with B.c. 753. In order, therefore, to reduce Roman dates to those of the Christian 
era, the year of the city is to be subtracted from 754: e.g. A.U.c. 691 (the year of 
Cicero’s consulship) corresponds to B.c. 63. 
Before Ceesar’s reform of the Calendar (B.c. 46), the Roman year consisted of 355 
days: March, May, Quintilis (July), and October having each 31 days, February hay- 
ing 28, and each of the remainder 29. As this calendar year was too short for the 
solar year, the Romans, in alternate years, at the discretion of the pontijicés, inserted 
a month of varying length (ménsis intercalaris) after February 23, and omitted the 
rest of February. The ‘Julian year,” by Cesar’s reformed Calendar, had 365 days, 
divided into months as at present. Every fourth year the 24th of February (vi. Kal. 
Mart.) was counted twice, giving 29 days to that month: hence the year was called 
bissextilis. The month Quintilis received the name Julius (July), in honor of Julius 
Cesar; and Sextilis was called Augustus (August), in honor of his successor. The 
Julian year (see below) remained unchanged till the adoption of the Gregorian Calen- 
dar (A.D. 1582), which omits leap-year three times in every four hundred years. 
631. Dates, according to the Roman Calendar, are reckoned 
as follows: 
a, The first day of the month was called Kalendae (Calends). 
Norn. —Kalendae is derived from calare, to call, —the Calends being the day on 
which the pontiffs publicly announced the New Moon in the Comitia Calata. This 
they did, originally, from actual observation. 
b. On the fifteenth day of March, May, July, and October, but the thir- 
teenth of the other months, were the Idiis (Ides), the day of Full Moon. 
¢. On the seventh day of March, May, July, and October, but the jifth 
of the other months, were the Nénae (Nones or ninths). 
d. From the three points thus determined, the days of the month were 
reckoned backwards as so many days before the Nones, the Ides, or the 
Calends. The point of departure was, by Roman custom, counted in the" 
reckoning, the second day being three days before, etc. This gives the fol- 
lowing rule for determining the date : —   
If the given date be Calends, add two to the number of days in the month pre- 
ceding, — if Nones or Ides, add one to that of the day on which they fall, —and 
from the number thus ascertained subtract the given date. Thus,—

month. 
Measures of Value, etc. 
632. The money of the Romans was in early times wholly of cop- 
per. The unitwas the as, which was nominally a pound in weight, but 
actually somewhat less. It was divided into twelve unciae (ounces).
-P-A-G-E-442
  430 MISCELLANEOUS [S§ 632-636 
In the third century B.c. the as was gradually reduced to one-half 
of its original value. In the same century silver coins were intro- 
duced, — the dénarius and the séstertius. The denarius = 10 asses; 
the sestertius = 2} asses. 
633. The Sestertius was probably introduced at a time when the 
as had been so far reduced that the value of the new coin (24 asses) 
was equivalent to the original value of the as. Hence, the Sester- 
tius (usually abreviated to +S or HS) came to be used as the unit 
of value, and nummus, coin, often means simply séstertius. As the 
reduction of the standard went on, the sestertius became equivalent 
to 4 asses. Gold was introduced later, the aureus being equal to 
100 sesterces. The approximate value of these coins is seen in the 
following table : — 
24 asses = 1 séstertius or nummus, value nearly 5 cents (24d.). 
10 asses or 4 séstertii=1dénarius. ‘ $6 35208 S605): 
1000 séstertii=1séstertium ... “ “$50.00 (£10). 
Nore. — The word séstertius is a shortened form of sémis-tertius, the third one, a 
half. The abbreviation HS or HS =duo et sémis, two and a half. 
634, The séstertium (probably originally the genitive plural of sés- 
tertius depending on mille) was a sum of money, not a coin; the word 
is inflected regularly as a neuter noun: thus, tria séstertia = $150.00. 
When séstertium is combined with a numeral adverb, centéna milia, 
hundreds of thousands, is to be understood: thus deciéns séstertium 
(deciéns us) = deciéns centéna milia séstertium= $50,000. Séstertium in 
this combination may also be inflected : deciéns séstertii, séstertid, eto. 
In the statement of large sums séstertium is often omitted as well 
as centéna milia: thus sexagiéns (Rosc. Am. 2) signifies, sexagiéns 
[centéna milia séstertium] = 6,000,000 sesterces = $300,000 (nearly). 
635. In the statement of sums of money in Roman numerals, a 
line above the number indicates thousands; lines above and at the 
sides also, hundred-thousands. Thus us pc=600 séstertii; us DG= 
600,000 séstertii, or 600 séstertia; Hs [Dc] 60,000,000 séstertii, or 
60,000 séstertia. 
636. The Roman Measures of Length are the following: — 
12 inches (unciae) = 1 Roman Foot (pés: 11.65 English inches). 
14 Feet = 1 Cubit (cubitum). — 24 Feet =1 Step (gradus). 
5 Feet =1 Pace (passus). — 1000 Paces (mille passwum) = 1 Mile.
-P-A-G-E-443
  §§ 636-638] MEASURES OF WEIGHT AND CAPACITY 481 
The Roman mile was equal to 4850 English feet. 
The ifigerum, or unit of measure of land, was an area of 240 (Roman) 
feet long and 120 broad; a little less than 3 of an English acre. 
637, The Measures of Weight are — 
12 unciae (ownces) = one pound (libra, about } Ib. avoirdupois). 
Fractional parts (weight or coin) are — 
tn uncia. Pn quincunc. 4, dodrans. 
$ sextans. 4, semis. 3, deatans. 
4, quadrans. zs, septunt. 44, deunz. 
1, triéns. 2, bes or bessis. Th, as. 
The Talent (talentum) was a Greek weight (réAavrov) = 60 librae. 
638, The Measures of Capacity are — 
12 cyatht =1 sextarius (nearly a pint). 
16 sextarit = 1 modius (peck). 
6 sextarii = 1 congius (3 quarts, liquid measure). 
8 congit =1 amphora (6 gallons).

  482 : GLOSSARY [ss 639, 640 
GLOSSARY 
OF TERMS USED IN GRAMMAR, RHETORIO, AND PROSODY 
639. Many of these terms are pedantic names given by early grammarians to forms 
of speech used naturally by writers who were not conscious that they were using fig- 
ures at all—as, indeed, they were not. Thus when one says, “It gaye me no little 
pleasure,”’ he is unconsciously using litotes; when he says, ‘‘John went up the street, 
James down,” antithesis; when he says, “High as the sky,” hyperbole. Many were 
given under a mistaken notion of the nature of the usage referred to, Thus méd and 
téd (§ 143. a. N.) were supposed to owe their d to paragoge, simpsi its p to epenthesis. 
Such a sentence as ‘‘ See my coat, how well it fits!” was supposed to be an irregularity 
to be accounted for by prolepsis. 
Many of these, however, are convenient designations for phenomena which often 
occur; and most of them have an historic interest, of one kind or another, 
640. Grammatical Terms 
Anacoluthon: a change of construction in the same sentence, leaving the 
first part broken or unfinished. 
Anastrophe: inversion of the usual order of words. 
Apodosis: the conclusion of a conditional sentence (see Protasis). 
Archaism: an adoption of old or obsolete forms. 
Asyndeton: omission of conjunctions (§ 323. b). 
Barbarism: adoption of foreign or unauthorized forms. 
Brachylogy: brevity of expression. 
Crasis: contraction of two vowels into one (§ 15. 3). 
Ellipsis: omission of a word or words necessary to complete the sense. 
Enallage: substitution of one word or form for another. 
Epenthesis: insertion of a letter or syllable. 
Hellenism: use of Greek forms or constructions. 
Hendiadys (ev 81 8voiv): the use of two nouns with a conjunction, instead 
of a single modified noun. 
Hypallage: interchange of constructions. + 
Hysteron proteron: a reversing of the natural order of ideas. 
This term was applied to cases where the natural sequence of events is violated in 
language because the later event is of more importance than the earlier and so comes 
first to the mind. This was supposed to be an artificial embellishment in Greek, and 
so was imitated in Latin. It is still found in artless narrative; cf. ‘Bred and Born in 
a Brier Bush”’ (Uncle Remus). 
Metathesis: transposition of letters in a word. 
Paragoge: addition of a letter or letters to the end of a word. 
Parenthesis: insertion of a phrase interrupting the construction.
-P-A-G-E-445
  §§ 640, 641] RHETORICAL FIGURES 488 
Periphrasis: a roundabout way of expression (cirewmlocution). 
Pleonasm: the use of needless words. 
Polysyndeton: the use of an unnecessary number of copulative conjunctions. 
Prolepsis: the use of a word in the clause preceding the one where it would 
naturally appear (anticipation). 
Protasis: a clause introduced by a conditional expression (if, when, whoever), 
leading to a conclusion called the Apodosis (§ 512). 
Syncope: omission of a letter or syllable from the middle of a word. 
Synesis (constrictié ad sénsum): agreement of words according to the sense, 
and not the grammatical form (§ 280. a). 
Tmesis: the separation of the two parts of a compound word by other words 
(cutting). 
This term came from the earlier separation of prepositions (originally adverbs) from 
the verbs with which they were afterwards joined ; so in per ecastor scitus puer, a very 
fine boy, egad! As this was supposed to be intentional, it was ignorantly imitated in 
Latin; as in cere- comminuit -brum (Ennius). 
Zeugma: the use of a verb or an adjective with two different words, to 
only one of which it strictly applies (yoking). 
641. Rhetorical Figures 
Allegory: a narrative in which abstract ideas figure as circumstances, events, 
or persons, in order to enforce some mo‘al truth. 
Alliteration: the use of several words that begin with the same sound. 
Analogy: argument from resemblances. 
Anaphora: the repetition of a word at the beginning of successive clauses 
(§ 598. f). Antithesis: opposition, or contrast of parts (for emphasis: § 598. /). 
Antonomasia: use of a proper for a common noun, or the reverse : — 
sint Maecénatés, non deerunt, Flacce, Marénés, so there be patrons (like Mex- 
cenas), poets (like Virgil) will not be lacking, Flaccus (Mart. viii. 56. 5). 
illa furia et pestis, that fury and plague (i.e. Clodius); Homéromastix, scourge 
of Homer (i.e. Zoilus).

Catachresis: a harsh metaphor (abasid, misuse of words). 
Chiasmus: a reversing of the order of words in corresponding pairs of phrases 
(§ 598. /). Climax: a gradual increase of emphasis, or enlargement of meaning. 
Euphemism: the mild expression of a painful or repulsive idea : — 
si quid ei acciderit, if anything happens to him (i.e. if he dies), 
Euphony: the choice of words for their agreeable sound. 
Hyperbaton: violation of the usual order of words.

ALLEN AND GREENOUGH’S 
SHORTER LATIN GRAMMAR 
FOR SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIES. 
Condensed and Revised by Professor JAMES B. GREENOUGH, 
Assisted by ALBERT A. HOWARD. 
12mo, Cloth. 371 pages. For introduction, 95 cents.   
Space does not allow here a full description of this book, 
but attention is called to the following points : 
First. Allen and Greenough’s Shorter Latin Grammar does not 
attempt the impossible. It does not aim to be at once a brief grammar 
and a full one, to cover both preparatory and college Latin courses in a 
space sufficient for only the former. 
Second. The reduction of size is secured not by retaining arbi- 
trarily what one or two scholars deem essential, but by ascertaining 
minutely what points are involved in the study of preparatory Latin. 
It must be admitted that any one who attacks the problem in this way 
will find that a great deal more information is required for thorough 
reading of the preparatory texts than any @ Jriord maker of a short 
Latin grammar would suppose. 
Third. It has been found entirely feasible to follow the section 
numbering of the large Allen and Greenough Grammar, so that the 
full and the short grammars can be used in the same classes and the 
same set of references apply. Ifa class includes boys who are going 
to college and also boys who are not, the former may purchase the 
full grammar and the latter the short one. 
Fourth, The Latin grammar that shall be thoroughly satisfac- 
tory under all the conditions it is to meet in thousands of schools of 
every sort, must be a growth, and it is believed that the experience of 
making a full and complete grammar and of watching the use of it 
in schools for years, is almost a prerequisite to the preparation of a 
thoroughly satisfactory small one.

SECOND YEAR LATIN Edited, with Introduction, Notes, and Vocabulary, by James B. GrexNoucn, late Professor of Latin in Harvard University; B. L. D’Oocx, Professor of Latin and Greek in Michigan State Normal College, Ypsilanti, and M. Grant Danrxt, recently Principal of Chauncy-Hall School, Boston

embraces in Part I ninety-six pages of easy Latin stories and 
fables as a preparation for Caesar, followed in Part II by selec- 
tions from Caesar’s “Gallic War,” equivalent in amount to the 
first four books. It is hoped that thus a better graded and wider course, 
and a more interesting one as well, may be found for young students than 
the unvaried reading of the first four books of Caesar’s “Commentaries.” 
Part II provides a selected course of reading from Caesar rather than 
the first four books. Parts of these books are unusually difficult, and 
parts are lacking in interest. By making selections from the seven 
books, both of these obstacles to successful work have been in large 
measure overcome. The selections from Caesar include the War against 
the Belgian Confederacy, the Campaign against the Veneti, the two 
Invasions of Britain, the two Invasions of Germany, the Siege and Sack 
of Avaricum, and the Siege of Alesia. 
Special attention is called to the Notes. They are very copious and in 
every respect adapted to the needs of second-year students of Latin. 
A considerable number of oral exercises for turning English into 
Latin, in the form of question and answer, and some exercises for oral 
and written translation, all founded on the miscellaneous matter in 
Part I, have been inserted, so that the writing and speaking of Latin 
may accompany the course in reading. 
The Vocabulary, like all the vocabularies in the Allen and Greenough 
series, is unique in that it gives full etymologies rather than mere hints 
at derivations. It is uncommonly full of phrases and idioms that occur 
in the text. 
The illustrations, like those in the Allen and Greenough editions of 
Caesar, Cicero, and Virgil, have been selected with care, with the idea 
that they should be truly educative. 
The leading colleges and universities have given assurance that the 
book will be readily accepted as the full equivalent of the first four 
books of Caesar’s “ Gallic War.” Ts book is intended to follow any first Latin book. It

  ALLEN AND GREENOUGH’S 
CAESAR: GALLIC WAR REVISED EDITION 
Edited by Jamzs B. Grernouen, late Professor of Latin in Harvard University ‘L. D’OoGe, Professor of Latin and Greek in Michigan State Normal 
College, Ypsilanti, and M. Grant Dante -t, recently 
Principal of Chauncy-Hall School, Boston 
BOOKS I-IV. 12mo. Half leather. lix+ 268 +162 pages. Illustrated. List price, $1.00; mailing price, $1.10. BOOKS I-VII. x2mo. Half leather. Ix-+616 pages. Illustrated. List price, $1.25; mailing price, $1.40. : 
HIS new edition of Caesar’s “Gallic War” keeps prominently 
in view the needs of the beginner, on the ground that a large 
majority of those who read Caesar take it up immediately after 
finishing their first lessons. It is believed that all this class of students’ 
needs have been fully met in the present edition. 
Professor Greenough has specially qualified himself for editing this 
edition by traveling and making recent investigations in France. Not 
only the Notes but the illustrations have profited greatly. A consider- 
able number of the pictures in this edition are from photographs made 
especially for it. In other cases, pictures not previously seen in this 
country have been obtained. The museums have been visited and 
many new illustrations drawn from them. At the same time all the 
standard and essential illustrations are used. It is believed that this 
part of the editing will be found of signal excellence and practical value. 
Seyeral reading courses are suggested, each one of which, while 
embracing an amount of text equal to the first four books, contains 
choice selections of narrative and adventure from the various books. It 
is believed that this feature will be especially acceptable to teachers who 
have found the monotony of Caesar irksome but have seen no way to 
vary the course. 
Except in amount of Latin text, the four-book edition is practically 
identical with the new edition of the complete Caesar’s “Gallic War.” 
It contains the Introduction, with the exception of two irrelevant pages, 
the groups of related words, and the full Vocabulary. Many of the 
illustrations of Books V, VI, and VII are inserted at the close, in order 
to explain graphically a number of the references in the Introduction 
and in the Notes. Quantities of long vowels are marked.

  ALLEN & GREENOUGH’S 
CICERO 
Revised Edition 
Revised by J. B. GREENOUGH, late Professor of Latin in Harvard University, and GEORGE L. KITTREDGE, Professor of English in Harvard Uni- 
versity, formerly Professor of Latin in Phillips Exeter Academy 
With a SPECIAL VOCABULARY by Professor Greenough

mailing price, $1.55 
Tuis new edition of Cicero has been treated with special 
reference to the use of the orations as models of classic 
oratory. The Introduction is made to help in this study of 
applied logic and rhetoric. There is a full life of Cicero, 
describing his education and development as an orator, as 
well as his political career. There is a chapter connecting 
the style of the orations with ancient formal rhetoric. There 
is also a chapter on Roman oratory and the place of the 
orator in ancient civilization. 
The text includes the following orations: The Manilian 
Law; four orations against Catiline; Archias; Milo; Mar- 
cellus; Ligarius; the fourteenth Philippic; and copious 
extracts from the Defence of Roscius and the Actio Secunda 
against Verres. 
Almost everything admitting of graphic presentation has 
an illustration, and no little study has been expended in 
finding the most suitable pictures. Views of places, scenes 
of Roman life, and portraits have been specially sought. 
Many coins are shown. ‘The illustrations are fully explained 
in the Index, with criticisms.

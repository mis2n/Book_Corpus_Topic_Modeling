  PREFATORY NOTE 
This volume essays a comprehensive but, at the 
same time, compact consideration of a movement 
which seems destined, like the advent of the junior 
high school, to affect profoundly the organization of 
our American system of education. The endeavor 
has been to present content of such a character and 
in such form as to prove useful to those who desire to 
make themselves conversant in a general way with 
the movement, and likewise to those who seek infor- 
mation on how best to encourage its development in 
a state or other system of schools or to administer 
junior-college work in a particular locality. 
The factual basis drawn upon for present purposes 
is the findings of an extended investigation of the 
movement carried forward by the writer under sub- 
ventions from the Commonwealth Fund of New York 
City and from the University of Minnesota. The two- 
volume report of this investigation has been issued as 
a Research Publication of the University, Education 
Series, No. 5.

MOVEMENT 
I 
SCOPE AND VARIETY OF THE MOVEMENT 
I. Irs GrowTH AND PRESENT SCOPE 
The junior college a recent development. During 
the last two decades there have appeared upon the 
educational scene two new units asking for recognition 
in our system of education. Singularly enough, and 
without apparent conjunction of intention on the part 
of their friends, both have been brought before the 
American audience bearing in the names most fre- 
quently applied to them the word “junior.” This is, 
however, not without analogous reason, since each is 
designed to provide education for those who in their 
stages of training are in the vicinage of the beginning 
years of the institution of which it is the namesake. 
For one of them, the junior high school, the writer has 
already attempted an evaluation, and has set down 
what seemed to him to be the basic principles of 
guidance in its development. A similar but more 
[1]
-P-A-G-E-14
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
  comprehensive evaluation of the other, the junior 
college, is here essayed. 
Of the two movements which are referred to, the 
one lower in the system—and probably in part be- 
cause it is lower in the system—has taken greater 
hold and is to be found in greater numbers in most 
sections of the country. The junior college, how- 
ever, has grown at a rapid rate, and seems no less 
to merit such evaluation as is possible in its present 
state of development. 
The present scope of the movement. It is no easy 
task to ascertain the exact number of examples of a 
new educational unit. Those who may be appealed to 
in any state for lists of junior colleges are sometimes 
unaware of the existence of all such institutions. A 
few schools may have been discontinued or may have 
metamorphosed into four-year colleges. In some in- 
stances there is unwillingness of authorities in charge 
to supply the items of information asked for. Inquiries 
extending over a period of nine months indicate, how- 
ever, that by the end of the school year 1921-1922 the 
number of junior colleges of the three main types, 
public, state, and private, had mounted to approxi- 
mately two hundred. During the succeeding school 
years the number has increased, so we may with 
assurance say at this writing that it is well over this 
mark.

  SCOPE AND VARIETY OF THE MOVEMENT 
II. Types oF Juntor CoLLEcEs 
A. PUBLIC JUNIOR COLLEGES 
Growth and present status. The increase in the 
number of junior colleges maintained by city, high- 
school, or junior-college districts, hereafter to be re- 
ferred to as “public junior colleges,” has been nothing 
short of notable. The first of these institutions to 
come into existence is the one maintained in connec- 
tion with the township high school at Joliet, Illinois. 
Another was established about the same time in 
’ Goshen, Indiana, but has since been discontinued. It 
was not until 1911 that others of the group considered 
were established, the period of most rapid develop- 
ment beginning in 1915. As far as may be accurately 
ascertained thirty-six institutions of this type were in 
operation during 1921-1922. One of these has since — 
been discontinued, but at least nine, despite the finan- 
cial difficulties of the times, were added during 1922- 
1923, bringing the total to at least forty-five or fifty. 
Establishment of additional units is under considera- 
tion in a number of other communities. 
The control of these units. Since they are nearly 
always maintained in connection with city and high- 
school districts, the units are under the direction and 
control of local school authorities, except in so far as 
these solicit the guidance of the universities in the 
states of location. Certain of the junior colleges of 
[4]
-P-A-G-E-17
  SCOPE AND VARIETY OF THE MOVEMENT 
California have entered upon an affiliation with their 
state university which implies some measure of co- 
operative direction. 
Almost exclusively these public junior colleges are 
housed with high-school units, although there are 
varying degrees of separation of administration, teach- 
ing faculty, student body, and social life in the two 
units. The only exceptions met with are in Kansas 
City, Missouri, where the upper unit, although a part 
of the public-school system, is housed in a separate 
structure at some distance from high-school units; 
and the junior college in Grand Rapids, Michigan. 
Some other communities maintaining junior colleges 
are considering the provision of separate housing, but 
many do not regard complete separation as desirable. 
The chief factor of growth. The facts of control 
and housing of this type of junior college direct at- 
tention to what seems a chief factor (although not at 
all the only factor) in their development, that they 
are upward extensions of our public-school system; a 
step in evolution which is a natural one in communi- 
ties that have in something like a satisfactory manner 
taken care of education on the lower levels. The first 
step was the provision of the work of the common 
school, next to follow was the high school, and last to 
come is what many school authorities concerned are 
inclined to believe is the culmination of the local 
school system—the junior college. 
[5] 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
B. STATE INSTITUTIONS 
  Growth and present status. Under the second type, 
those maintained as state institutions or as parts of 
state institutions, may be grouped a wide variety of 
junior colleges. Most of the units, however, are main- 
tained in connection with normal schools and teachers’ 
colleges. This was the last of the types to come into 
existence, but its representatives have increased in 
numbers with considerable rapidity since their first 
appearance. A spurt of growth for 1921 was caused 
entirely by developments in California, and here the 
increase was in part at the expense of junior colleges 
in high-school districts, which were taken over by state 
teacher-training institutions. 
The total number of these units on state founda- 
tions in 1921-1922 was twenty-four. Of these, six 
only were not operated in connection with normal 
schools and teachers’ colleges. Without question this 
number of state institutions would be somewhat larger 
if to it were added normal schools and teachers’ col- 
leges which, without making formal announcement of 
offering junior-college or regular college curricula, 
permit or encourage students who plan to go on to 
other higher institutions to carry academic work to 
the exclusion or almost to the exclusion of professional 
courses. This does not refer to those teacher-training 
institutions whose graduates pursuing regular two- 
[6]
-P-A-G-E-19
    
  SCOPE AND VARIETY OF THE MOVEMENT 
year professional curricula are granted two years of 
credit in colleges or universities to which they transfer. 
Such institutions are not here regarded as belonging 
properly to the junior-college movement, despite the 
fact that their catalogues sometimes refer to them as 
junior colleges. 
Control.. For junior colleges in normal schools and 
teachers’ colleges the control, with one exception, is 
lodged in whatever authorities direct the institutions 
of which they are apart. These are the state normal- 
school board or, in a small proportion of instances, the 
special board in charge of a particular normal school. 
The exception is the Southern Branch of the Univer- 
sity of California, which is in charge of the parent in- 
stitution. The control of the six remaining units varies 
between state boards of education, as with Idaho Poly- 
technic Institute, and boards in charge of a special 
type of education, as with Grubbs Vocational College* 
and John Tarleton Agricultural College in Texas, op- 
erating under the same board as does the Agricultural 
and Mechanical College. 
The chief factor of growth. The outstanding factor 
in the growth of junior colleges in normal schools and 
teachers’ colleges (the prevailing group in this type) 
is the motive of expansion from the normal-school 
to a more widely functioning status. Since the goal 
selected for the normal school is more often than any

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
other the full-fledged teachers’ college, to provide the 
academic work for junior-college curricula is looked 
upon as a stepping-stone to the status sought, and 
consequently as at least temporarily desirable. 
C. PRIVATE JUNIOR COLLEGES 
Growth and present status. Of the three types of 
junior colleges the private seem to have come into 
existence soonest and to have increased in numbers at 
the most rapid rate. A small number were reported to 
have been in existence before or at the opening of the 
century, but it is unlikely that they were established 
with anything like a consciousness of the relationship 
of such establishment to a junior-college movement. 
It may even be that in a few instances the answer to 
the writer’s inquiry on this point was made on the 
erroneous assumption that what was asked for was the 
date of establishment of the institution, rather than of 
the junior-college curriculum. In other instances there 
must have been in operation in these early years an 
advanced curriculum two years in length which, at the 
inception of the movement proper, logically classified 
as a junior-college offering. In at least two instances 
there were institutions patterned to some extent after 
the German Gymnasium, which presumably carries 
the student to the end of our second college year. 
The growth of this type has been so rapid through- 
out the period since the opening of the century that 
[8] 
 
-P-A-G-E-21
  
SCOPE AND VARIETY OF THE MOVEMENT 
despite the rapid development of the other types they 
still maintain their numerical supremacy at the pres- 
ent time, since they now constitute fully two thirds of 
all units bearing this name. 
Control. Approximately a hundred (which means 
three fourths) of the total number of private institu- 
tions were reported as operating under the auspices of 
some church or other religious group. A wide range 
of denominational frequency is represented, beginning 
with the Methodist Episcopal Church and including 
considerable numbers with Lutheran, Baptist, Catho- 
lic, Presbyterian, Latter-Day Saints, Christian, and 
Episcopal connections, not to mention a scattering of 
others. The remainder are reported by authorities in 
charge as being under “private” auspices. Approxi- 
mately half of these are strictly private-venture 
schools. 
Secondary-school association. Like the junior col- 
leges in city and high-school districts, but unlike those 
in state institutions, most of this group are maintained 
in association with institutions of secondary-school 
grade. In some cases the two junior-college classes 
are known as junior and senior years, and the two 
high-school years immediately below as freshman and 
sophomore years. 
The chief factor of development. Although, as with 
the two preceding types, the factors of development 
of private junior colleges have been various, the chief 
[9]  
-P-A-G-E-22
  
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
force has probably been the movement for standardi- 
zation of higher institutions. Not being in a position, 
on account of inadequate teaching staff, facilities, and 
resources, to qualify as standard four-year colleges, 
many less well-established institutions have taken re- 
course to the junior-college status as a means of find- 
ing a recognized place in the school system. In a 
small proportion of instances the growth has had some- 
thing akin to that of the stronger public high school, 
which through sheer vigor, both scholastic and finan- 
cial, has tended to rise into the higher levels of educa- 
tion. Then, too, there is the group of weaker but 
aspiring secondary schools, which look upon the junior- 
college status as one step above the high-school level 
and therefore that much nearer the goal of the stand- 
ard college, to which they hope to evolve during the 
passage of a few to several years. Lastly, there is the 
small group already mentioned, which were established 
as presumable equivalents of German Gymnasia. But 
by far the most common factor is the first one cited. 
D. THE JUNIOR COLLEGE IN UNIVERSITIES 
The fourth type is the one which at this writing is 
to be found as a lower division including the first 
two years in six universities of the West and Mid- 
West. Although bearing significant relationships to 
other types, it is reserved for further description in

III. GEocGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF JUNIOR 
CoLLEGES 
The distribution in general. The geographical dis- 
tribution of two hundred and seven junior colleges of 
the three types is shown in the accompanying map of 
the United States. Among the general impressions 
. gained from a cursory examination of the map are 
(1) the widespread representation of the movement 
(eleven only of the forty-eight states contain no junior 
colleges) ; (2) the greater prevalence in the Southern, 
Mid-Western, and Pacific-coast states; (3) the ap- 
pearance of public junior colleges primarily in the 
Mid-West and California; (4) the appearance of the 
smaller number of junior colleges as state institutions 
in a distribution almost fully as widely scattered; 
(5) the rather general distribution of private units to 
almost all sections of the country, but with a consider- 
able degree of concentration in Missouri and the 
Southern states, a full half being in the South; and 
(6) a much smaller representation in New England 
and the middle Atlantic states than elsewhere.

1921-1922 ranged widely, from as few as six or seven 
students to well over a thousand. The middle case for

institutions, 78; for private units, 44. The ranges in 
enrollments of the middle 50 per cent when thus 
arranged are, respectively, 39 to 151, 28 to 195, and 
28 to 72. These figures show that private junior col- 
leges run somewhat smaller than do the other types.

figures are added they mount to a grand total of more 
than 16,000 students, or, roughly, the equivalent of 
the enrollment in two large state universities—no 
inconsiderable number. The enrollment during 1922- 
1923 was in all likelihood well up toward 20,000.

THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
V. CoEDUCATION AND SEGREGATION IN JUNIOR 
COLLEGES 
  A final detail in this preliminary description of the 
status of the junior-college movement concerns the 
distribution of the several types as to men’s, women’s, 
and coeducational institutions. Public and state units 
are seldom if ever segregated institutions, whereas in 
almost three fifths of the cases private junior colleges 
are not coeducational. Of the segregated units ap- 
proximately three fourths are for women and the re- 
maining fourth for men. 
VI. THe Movement Merits CONSIDERATION 
In the brief span of approximately two decades an 
educational institution practically unknown at the 
opening of the century has multiplied to such an extent 
that at the close of the period the total number of 
its representatives is well in excess of two hundred. 
Exclusive of the units to be found in universities, these 
junior colleges group roughly under three widely dif- 
fering types: public junior colleges, those in state 
institutions, and schools on private foundations. 
Within each group there are variations. These junior 
colleges are to be found in one or more of their three 
forms in more than three fourths of the states and in 
all sections of the country. They range in enrollment 
from a mere handful of students to more than a thou- 
[14]
-P-A-G-E-27
  SCOPE AND VARIETY OF THE MOVEMENT 
sand, and the grand total of registration in them is 
already far in excess of that of two large state univer- 
sities. There can be no doubt that a movement which 
develops through these variations and to such propor- 
tions during such a brief period of time is deserving of 
more scrutiny than it has had, both for the purpose of 
evaluating it and, in the event of its being found a 
desirable addition to the educational system, for mark- 
ing out appropriate lines of its future development. 
The first step toward this evaluation, taken in the 
next chapter, is to ascertain the nature of the expecta- 
tions of the movement by its friends—the current 
conceptions of the special purposes of the junior 
college.

CURRENT CONCEPTIONS OF THE SPECIAL 
PURPOSES OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE 
I. CANVASSING FOR THE PURPOSES 
Many who take thought for the first time of the 
function of the junior college are inclined to look upon 
this new unit in the school system solely as a sort of 
isthmus connecting the mainland of elementary and 
secondary education with the peninsula of profes- 
sional and advanced academic training. A canvass of 
the special purposes of this recent addition to our 
educational institutions shows, on the other hand, that 
many of its friends expect much more of it than that 
it shall be a mere “neck of land between two larger 
bodies of land.” In large part these friends of the 
junior college look upon it as an institution with a 
function far more extensive than that just described, 
affecting much larger proportions of the population 
and influencing profoundly the organization of educa- 
tion on levels above and below. 
What is presented in this chapter touching the 
special purposes of the junior college has been com- 
piled from an analysis of a wide variety of materials. 
i 16]
-P-A-G-E-29
  
SPECIAL PURPOSES OF JUNIOR COLLEGE 
Among these materials were, first, twenty-two articles 
and addresses published in educational periodicals or, 
in a few instances, as parts of volumes. Most of the 
statements used appeared in print within the last 
decade. Among those whose contributions to the 
literature on the junior college were used are Angell, 
Bolton, J. Stanley Brown, Claxton, Coursault, Harper, 
Hill, Judd, Lange, Vincent, and Zueblin, not to men- 
tion a number of others. The materials used may be 
assumed to be more or less complete statements of 
the writers’ conceptions of the meaning of this new 
movement. 
A second body of materials was. collected from the 
catalogues or bulletins issued by the junior colleges 
now in operation, in so far as these were supplied to 
the writer upon request directed to the head of each 
school reported by the United States Bureau of Edu- 
cation’ as maintaining a junior college. For the most 
part these catalogues were issued for the school year 
1920-1921, but in a few instances bulletins published 
a year or two earlier were used.. The total number of 
institutions represented is fifty-six, twenty-three be- 
ing public and thirty-three private. Seven of these 
here classified as public institutions are among those 
considered as state institutions in the foregoing chap- 
ter, four of them being in normal schools. The re- 
mainder are junior colleges maintained in connection

with city, union-district, township, or county high 
schools. Of the private junior colleges seventeen are 
in Southern states and sixteen in other states. 
The term “special purposes” as here used nowhere 
appears in the materials entering into the compilation. 
What have been so classified are what the articles and 
bulletins designate as the “advantages of,” “oppor- 
tunities of,” “values of,” “arguments for,” etc. the 
junior college. As may be seen from the following 
explanation, such statements, indicating as they do 
the aspirations entertained for the junior college by 
its friends, are readily transmutable into “special 
purposes.” 
Twenty-one more or less distinct purposes were 
found during the canvass. The original distribution 
contained almost fifty, but a careful consideration of 
meanings reduced the number more than half. These 
figures alone indicate a wide variety of functions ex- 
pected to be performed by the junior college, an indi- 
cation which is emphasized by a cursory examination 
of the purposes themselves or of the groups under 
which they may be classified. 
Before proceeding to the elucidation of each special 
purpose, mention should be made of some difficulties 
met with in the attempts at classification. In studies 
of this sort meanings shade into one another almost 
imperceptibly; one cannot be certain that violence 
has not sometimes been done by placing a particular 
[18] 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  SPECIAL PURPOSES OF JUNIOR COLLEGE 
statement under some particular category, thus to 
some extent misrepresenting the meaning intended by 
the author. It is also at times impossible to take ac- 
count of all interrelationships of purposes expressed 
or implied. Such minor difficulties, however, cannot 
appreciably affect the general conclusions of this study 
of special purposes, since the larger meanings stand 
out unequivocally. 
II. THe Purposes Founp 
Group I. Purposes affecting especially the two 
years under consideration. The first function to come 
up for mention, offering two years of work acceptable {. 
to colleges and universities, is the one most commonly 
put forward in the catalogues, but not in the remain- 
ing literature. This is the purpose which looks to the 
interests of students planning to go on to the higher 
levels of training, the isthmian function already re- 
ferred to. From the emphasis we may anticipate that 
this function will be more nearly certain of perform- 
ance than any of those following it in the list. 
The next two purposes (2 and 3) are among those 
which would make it possible for the junior college to 
serve the interests of those who are “not going on.” 
The former urges for such students the provision of J. 
opportunities for “rounding out their general educa- 
tion,” opportunities which are not given if the work 
[19]
-P-A-G-E-32
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
offered is only that regarded as preliminary to some 
form of advanced training. Those who have been in- 
terpreted as subscribing to this purpose are inclined to 
assume that for the student who is not going on edu- 
cation would be left at loose ends if he concluded his 
training with work suited to the first purpose. It is 
worth noting that the college catalogues do not posit 
this purpose as frequently as does the literature. 
The third purpose refers to preparation for occupa- 
tions, the final training for which would be given dur- 
ing junior-college years. If occupations for which the 
final training can be completed during what are com- 
monly accepted as secondary-school years are classi- 
fied as trades, and if those for which such training can 
be completed only with four or more years of work 
beyond the high school are classified as professions, 
what is advocated here is training for semiprofessions. 
Whenever the fields in which such training is to fall 
are named by the first two groups, they are agriculture, 
industry, home economics, and commerce. Teaching 
is the sole occupation named in the catalogues of pri- 
vate junior colleges. The usual statements in these 
catalogues, which come from private junior colleges 
in Missouri and the Southern states, are to the effect 
that the state departments grant certificates to teach 
upon the completion of some or all of the work of 
the two years if the candidate includes courses in 
education.

-P-A-G-E-34
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Under a fourth purpose, popularizing higher educa- 
tion, have been classified statements bearing on the 
lowering of the cost of education on this level or bring- 
ing it nearer the home of the student. These have 
been generalized in this way because cost and prox- 
imity are to be regarded as factors very influential in 
determining the proportions of the population who 
will avail themselves of higher educational opportuni- 
ties. It is significant to note that although this func- 
tion is recognized in large proportions of the literature 
and of the catalogues of public junior colleges, it is left 
unmentioned in the catalogues of private institutions. 
It is not difficult to see vital relationships between this 
purpose and the second and third, especially in view 
of the greater range of interests and mentality which 
must come to be represented in the larger proportion 
of the population that will be enrolled in these years 
of higher education if the junior-college plan is at all 
commonly introduced. 
Continuing home influences during immaturity 
(purpose 5) is proposed by a large proportion of those 
making the statements in educational literature, but 
by a much smaller proportion of the catalogues. 
Whenever this purpose is put forward in catalogues of 
private junior colleges, it refers to influences which 
are like those of the home, rather than being those of 
the home itself. Some of the statements specifically 
take cognizance of the “critical period” represented 
[22]
-P-A-G-E-35
4 SPECIAL PURPOSES OF JUNIOR COLLEGE 
by these years in the student’s life, a period especially 
dangerous if he attends the larger universities, where 
the fostering agencies are said not to be so well organ- 
ized and administered as in the smaller institutions. 
Closely associated with this purpose and, indeed, at 
times scarcely to be distinguished from it are those 
grouped under the sixth purpose, which emphasize 
what may be termed the social control of the individual 
in small groups. The other aspect of attention to the 
individual student—the predominant one—concerns 
‘individual attention during instruction owing to the 
smaller classes. Frequently mentioned is the fact that 
_such attention cannot be afforded in the larger schools. 
The next purpose (7), offering better opportunities for ‘7? 
‘ training in leadership, proposed in a few catalogues, 
seems to be put forward by those who feel that the 
small college, with its smaller enrollment than the 
large university, gives to all students better oppor- 
tunities for experiences which constitute “laboratory 
work” in leadership. 
The last two purposes in Group I, offering better 
instruction in these school years and allowing for ex- 
ploration, are not often named either in the literature 
or in the catalogues. The acceptance of the former as 
a special purpose is justified by those who propose it, 
on the ground of their belief that the best teachers of 
the secondary school are assigned to junior-college 
work, whereas the teachers of less experience and 
[23] f¢ 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
lower ranks often give ‘instruction to freshmen and 
sophomores in colleges and universities. 
Group II. Purposes affecting the organization of 
the school system. From this point in the list the 
purposes are not commonly recognized in the junior- 
college catalogues; they are put forward almost ex- 
clusively by those expressing themselves through the 
literature canvassed. It is to be expected that those 
who contributed to the literature would attempt 
more nearly complete statements of the functions of 
the new unit than would those who prepared the 
catalogues. 
The next four purposes (10-13), although having 
something in common, are sufficiently distinct -to 
justify their being separately listed. They all point 
toward the reorganization of the school system by urg- 
ing the upward extension of the secondary school. The 
first of these would accomplish this, its adherents 
maintain, by placing in the secondary school all work 
of secondary-school grade. Those who call attention to 
this advantage mention the fact that the high school 
in its upper years and the first two years of college or 
university have much of their curricula in common. 
Courses in mathematics and in the foreign languages 
are used as cases in point. Those who propose the 
second purpose of this group (11) complain that our 
four-year high school covers only a portion of the full 
period of adolescence, and recommend that in order 
[24]
-P-A-G-E-37
  
SPECIAL PURPOSES OF JUNIOR COLLEGE 
to adapt the organization to the periods of change in 
the nature of youth the secondary school must begin 
earlier and, at the other end, must include two addi- 
tional school years. The third (12) stresses the his- 
torical fact that our public-school system has shown a 
consistent tendency to develop by extension at the 
top, and that the next “logical” step in its evolution 
is the addition of the freshman and sophomore years 
of college. This purpose will be seen to have much 
in common with the fourth in Group I. The next pur- 
pose in Group II, economizing time and expense by 
avoiding duplication (13), is not unlike the first pur- 
pose in this group (10), but it emphasizes more espe- 
cially the avoidance of waste to be achieved through 
the changes made. 
The last purpose (14) in the group calls attention 
to the service performed for the smaller and weaker 
colleges by making a place for them in our system of 
education. The statements included here speak of the 
impracticability of the aspirations of many of these 
small colleges to become high-class four-year institu- 
tions, and stress the appropriateness of their becoming 
strong junior colleges in a system of which this two- 
year unit is an organic part. 
Group III. Purposes affecting the shined The 
next two purposes, relieving the university (15) and 
making possible real university functioning (16), are 
opposite aspects of the same situation. Statements 
[25] 
 
-P-A-G-E-38
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
classified under the former argue that the organization 
of the junior college will remove many or all under- 
classmen from the university and will free the latter 
to a large extent from the obligation of carrying for- 
ward extension work on the freshman and sophomore 
level; whereas statements classified under the latter 
contend that being thus freed from work on the lower 
level, the university will be in a position to function as 
a university—that is, it may devote itself exclusively 
to work on the higher level. This release will react 
favorably upon the character of instruction and will 
tend to encourage research, one of the functions of a 
university which suffers from the overload of fresh- 
man and sophomore work. Those who propose the 
next purpose (17) look to see an improvement in the 
preparation of students for university work, but they 
fail to mention the grounds for their hopes. These 
may be implicit in purposes 6, 8, and 9, as already 
presented. 
Group IV. Purposes affecting instruction in the 
high school. ‘The expectation that the establishment 
of the junior college will affect high-school instruction 
favorably (18) rests, in the minds of those who pro- 
pose it, on the general fact that a higher unit of the 
educational system always exercises an influence on 
the standards of a lower unit where the two institu- 
tions are closely associated. The single recognition of 
the next purpose (19) refers to the better opportunity 
[26]
-P-A-G-E-39
  SPECIAL PURPOSES OF JUNIOR COLLEGE 
of serving the interest of the more capable student 
who arrives at his fourth high-school year with less 
than four units of credit to earn for graduation. With 
junior-college work offered in the high school, he may 
progress without loss of time. 
Group V. Purposes affecting the local community. 
The last purpose but one (20) appears to be one of the 
not uncommon expectations, namely, that the junior 
college will be able to offer courses adapted to local 
needs, the particular needs whenever mentioned being 
vocational or social ; and the last (21) anticipates that 
the establishment of a junior college will affect the 
level of cultural interests of the local community to a 
degree now manifest in many college towns through- 
out the country. 
III. Purposes aT ONCE REQUIRING SCRUTINY AND 
SupPLYING CRITERIA 
As already intimated, this survey of the current 
conceptions of the special purposes of the junior col- 
lege reveals the fact that although the first function 
in the minds of many advocates is the offering of two 
years of work acceptable to higher institutions, the 
ambitions entertained for it far exceed this original 
service. These comprehend types of training better 
suited to the needs of the increasing proportion of the 
population which the junior college is expected to at- 
[27]
-P-A-G-E-40
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
tract, especially general and occupational types of 
training adapted to the needs of students who will not 
continue their education beyond the work of these 
two years. All these types of training are to be pro- 
vided under conditions which will foster, better than 
can prevalent conditions, the intellectual and social 
welfare of individual students. Advocates of the 
junior college anticipate that its general introduc- 
tion will affect profoundly, but in constructive ways, 
the organization and functioning of our system of 
education: it will permit the consummation of the 
secondary school, will assure the small college an un- 
questionable function in the educational system, and 
will encourage the university to differentiate its activi- 
ties from those of the lower schools, much of whose 
work it is now called upon to do. They also look for 
the junior college, through courses offered and through 
its cultural influences, to be highly serviceable to the 
local community. Other hopes are entertained for the 
junior college, but these are the predominant ones. 
These aspirations outline an ambitious program for 
this new unit—so ambitious, indeed, that the special 
purposes as catalogued cannot be accepted forthwith. 
However, they furnish a cross section of the edu- 
cational consciousness which has given rise to the 
movement, and at the same time they supply a set of 
tentative criteria, the validity of which is scrutinized 
in subsequent portions of this volume.

  Ill 
THE JUNIOR COLLEGE IN ITS ISTHMIAN 
FUNCTION—THE OFFERING 
I. THe Pian oF INQUIRY 
The chapter immediately preceding shows that the 
claim put forward on which there is the nearest ap- 
proach to full agreement among the three groups of 
sources used is offering two years of work acceptable 
to colleges and universities. The meaning of this claim 
has already been made clear as applying to students 
who plan to continue their education into the ad- 
vanced academic or professional courses beyond the 
junior-college level. It is the aim of the two chapters 
next following to examine into the feasibility of per- 
forming in junior colleges this isthmian function. The 
process of scrutiny will be made in the following man- 
ner: (1) testing out the assumption as far as it con- 
cerns two years of “college work” in the sense of the 
first two years of work in the usual college of letters 
and science; (2) inquiring into the feasibility of giv- 
ing effectively in junior colleges the first two years of 
work in training toward the professions, both in pre- 
professional curricula (for example, pre-legal and pre- 
[29] 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
    THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
medical) and in the freshman and sophomore years 
of professional curricula open to the student upon com- 
pletion of his high-school work (for example, agricul- 
ture or engineering) ; (3) comparing instructors and 
instruction in junior colleges with those on the same 
level in other higher institutions; and (4) reporting 
on the extent to which colleges are now willing to 
accept the product of this new unit in the educational 
system. The third and fourth portions, more espe- 
cially the former, have been included because accept- 
ability to other higher institutions cannot be decided 
on the basis solely of whether the work is offered or 
even actually going forward, but is to be evaluated 
also by considering who gives it and how effectively 
it is done. 
Il. THe Junior CoLLEcE AND THE First Two 
YEARS OF COLLEGE WorkK 
The junior-college offering. A careful analysis of 
the work offered in twenty-three public and thirty-five 
private junior colleges, as shown in their catalogues, 
gives an average total number of 255.0 semester-hours 
of work for the former group, 192.0 for the latter, and 
214.6 for all the fifty-eight institutions represented. 
When from the group classified here as public are 
removed seven operating on state foundations, the 
average amount of work offered drops to 219 semester- 
hours, whereas removing from the private group three 
[ 30 ]
-P-A-G-E-43
  THE OFFERING 
institutions at that time listing work beyond the sec- 
ond college year brings its average down to 160.4. 
A comparison of the amounts of work offered by the 
two groups in each of the several fields discovers in- 
teresting similarities and differences. In English, for 
example, the average extent of the offering does not 
differ widely, being 17.7 and 16.0 semester-hours re- 
spectively. The same may be said for public speaking, 
modern foreign languages, psychology, and physical 
education. However, in offerings in mathematics, 
science, the social subjects, music, agriculture, com- 
merce, engineering and industrial, and “other occupa- 
tional” the public institutions exceed the private, 
whereas in ancient languages, Bible and religion, 
education, and home economics the latter outdo the 
former. 
The percentage distribution for all units repre- 
sented in the analysis shows the largest proportion of 
the offering devoted to modern foreign language. 
Next in order follow science, the social subjects, Eng- 
lish, ancient languages, and mathematics. Fields re- 
ceiving little emphasis when measured in this way 
are public speaking, Bible and religion, philosophy, 
psychology, physical education, music, art, agricul- 
ture, and “other occupational” subjects. Lines of 
work whose extent of recognition lies between that 
for these two extremes are commerce, home economics, 
engineering and industrial courses, and education.

    THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
When the percentages for both ancient and modern 
foreign languages are added, they total more than a 
fourth of the total offering. When a similar addition 
is made for all occupational or near-occupational sub- 
jects, such as agriculture, commerce, education, en- 
gineering and industrial, etc., they include less than 
a fourth of the total offering. 
The listed offerings and the work going forward. 
It is to be expected that the amount of work and the 
number of courses reported in the catalogues are 
sometimes in excess of what is actually being taught. 
Those who have had contact with schools during their 
early aspirational stages will know that classes in some 
courses do not always materialize. 
Visits to junior colleges included a number of in- 
stitutions represented in the analysis just summarized, 
and therefore it was possible to make a comparison 
of the work in progress during the school year and 
that listed in the catalogue, and thereby estimate the 
extent to which the former falls below the latter. 
Of the junior colleges visited, the number on which 
the making of such a check was possible included nine 
public and five private schools—a total of fourteen. 
This constitutes almost a fourth of the fifty-eight 
junior colleges represented in the data so far presented 
in the current chapter, a proportion sufficiently large 
to be of considerable significance in passing judgment 
on the problem in hand.

THE OFFERING 
Of the public junior colleges there were five with 
less work going forward during the year than was 
listed, two without a difference in this respect, and 
two with more work going forward than was listed.

THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
sum of corrections was 1924, it appears that the aver- 
age per cent of unfavorable difference is 9.5. If this 
difference were found to apply to all public junior col- 
leges, it would mean a reduction of the average of 
255.0 previously reported by almost 25 semester- 
hours, bringing it down to 225 or 230 semester-hours. 
Of the private junior colleges there were three with 
less work going forward, one without a difference, and 
the other with an increase. The total amount of work 
listed is 985 semester-hours; the sum of the correc- 
tions is 53 semester-hours, an average of 5.4 per cent. 
If this difference were found to apply to all junior 
colleges of the private group, it would mean a reduc- 
tion of the average total of 192.0 semester-hours to 
something more than 180 hours of work actually 
going forward. While reductions in both groups are 
appreciable, they cannot be regarded as large enough 
to discredit the findings of the study made. 
A tabulation of the particular courses not going for- 
ward shows that the total number for both public and 
private institutions, not making allowance for addi- 
tional courses going forward and not in published lists, 
is sixty-five. These are scattered throughout the 
entire offering and manifest little or no tendency to 
locate in particular fields or especially in-the more 
advanced subjects. 
It seems safe to conclude that neither the average 
amount of reduction nor the extent of disappearance 
[34]

THE OFFERING 
of particular courses is large enough to warrant dis- 
crediting to any large extent the results of any subse- 
quent conclusions involving the description of the 
junior-college offerings that has been given. 
College offerings in freshman and sophomore years. 
The next step in the study of the feasibility of giving 
in junior colleges the first two years of college work is 
a comparison of the analysis of work just presented 
with that available during freshman and sophomore 
years in standard colleges of liberal arts. To arrive 
at some adequate description of the latter a similar 
analysis was made of the work in a large number of 
such institutions, one hundred and fourteen being of 
the separate college type and twenty of them colleges 
of liberal arts in institutions of the university type. 
All units included are on approved lists of some recog- 
nized standardizing agency. Except in sections where 
all or almost all colleges were included, as with New 
England and the Western states, resort was had to 
random selection. Both colleges and universities were 
selected with a view to securing lists geographically 
representative of the entire country. 
With one exception the amounts of work offered in 
each of the subject-groups in the colleges of liberal arts 
exceed those in junior colleges. The difference is 
especially notable for the colleges in universities, but 
there are also appreciable differences for the sepa- 
rate units. The only academic subject in which the 
[35]  
-P-A-G-E-48
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
amounts are almost equivalent is mathematics. Here 
the offerings in public junior colleges at least compare 
favorably with those in the other institutions. The 
single exception of excess for the new unit is in the 
materials that have been grouped under occupational. 
These include agriculture, commerce, engineering and 
industrial, home economics, and “other occupational.” 
The averages of total numbers of semester-hours of 
work offered are in harmony with expectations war- 
ranted by data on individual subjects or subject- 
groups. The total college offerings in the first two 
years exceed those in all junior colleges by fully 
50 per cent. The excess over public junior colleges is 
somewhat smaller. The offerings in these years in 
university colleges of liberal arts are more than double 
those in public junior colleges. When it is recalled 
that the averages for junior colleges are to some extent 
reduced when subtractions are made for courses listed 
but not going forward, the comparison becomes even 
more unfavorable. Were there no qualifying consid- 
erations such as are afforded below, the results of the 
comparison so far made would operate as a serious 
argument against the feasibility of the junior-college 
plan. 
Percentage distributions of the work offered show 
a much greater approximation to equivalence among 
the types of institutions being compared. Subject-

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
significant excesses are foreign language and science, 
the separate colleges leading in the former and the 
universities in the latter. Private institutions tend to 
bring up the average for junior colleges in the former 
group and tend to pull it down in the latter. Many 
private institutions are without equipment for college 
courses in science other than general inorganic chemis- 
try; this is not as characteristic of institutions of the 
public type. The percentage distributions of academic 
subjects show that the junior colleges are making 
endeavors, and consistent progress, in the direction of 
affording curricular materials which will meet the 
requirements here being considered. 
The proportion of occupational material in junior 
colleges far eclipses that in the other institutions. The 
smaller proportion in private than in public junior col- 
leges would be more than made up if work in the field 
of education were removed from the group in which it 
has been included and introduced at this point. The 
explanation of this larger proportion for junior col- 
leges is to be found in the wider service that some 
junior colleges are endeavoring to render than that of 
merely providing the first two years of work in colleges 
of liberal arts. For example, some public institutions 
are also endeavoring to give the first two years of en- 
gineering or other professional curricula, while in both 
groups there are occasional examples of efforts in the 
direction of affording some occupational training for

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
those who do not plan to continue their education 
beyond the junior-college level. 
A study of the range of work actually taken by the 
students. Since it may be thought that a canvass of 
offerings may hardly be looked upon as an adequate 
test of whether junior colleges do or can qualify on the 
aspiration of providing the first two years of college 
work, a study has been made (a summary of the find- 
ings of which is here reported) of the work actually 
taken by a group of two hundred randomly selected 
students during their first two years of attendance 
upon a college of liberal arts, in this instance the Col- 
lege of Science, Literature, and the Arts, of the Uni- 
versity of Minnesota. The aim of the special inquiry 
in this instance was to secure some measure of the 
degree to which all the work actually taken by these 
students is or is not spread evenly over the entire 
range of work included in their curricula. 
The method of this special inquiry will require a 
word of explanation through illustrative application, 
for which the subject of mathematics is used. A total 
of five hundred and forty quarter-hours of work in this 
field* were taken by the two hundred students re- 
ferred to. The courses represented included only 
higher algebra (five credits), solid geometry (five 
credits), college algebra (five credits), trigonometry 
1The computation doesnot include the courses in commercial algebra and 
the mathematics of investment, which were introduced under occupational. 
[40]
-P-A-G-E-53
  THE OFFERING 
(five credits), analytic geometry (five credits), and 
calculus (five credits). These courses may be seen to 
represent a total range of 30 credit-hours. Three of 
them (namely, solid geometry, analytic geometry, and 
calculus) were taken by 2 per cent (four students) or 
less of the two hundred students. As these represent 
a range of fifteen credits, they constitute 50 per cent 
of the total range of work in this field. As these three 
courses were taken by one, three, and one, respec- 
tively, of the two hundred students, the total amount 
of credit covered by them is 25 quarter-hours. This 
amount is 4.6 per cent of the total of 540 hours taken 
in mathematics. The three remaining courses— 
higher algebra, college algebra, and trigonometry— 
registered 37, 19, and 47, respectively, of these stu- 
dents, involving 515 credit-hours, or 95.4 per cent of 
all the work taken in mathematics. There is thus a 
marked contrast between the proportion of range of 
work in mathematics represented in the courses taken 
by 2 per cent or less of the students and the proportion 
of the total credit covered by these courses when 
weighted by the number of students by whom they 
are taken. A half of the credit range of the courses 
accounts for less than a twentieth of the total credit 
involved. 
Data for the remaining subjects and subject-groups 
disclose similar, although not always equivalent, con- 
trasts. The only subject-groups that show larger pro- 
[41] 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
portions of total credit for courses infrequently taken 
are foreign language, fine arts, and occupational, for 
which the percentages are, respectively, 10.6, 15.5, and 
17.2. The difference in the cases of fine arts and occu- 
pational is primarily attributable to the fact that it 
is rare for a large number of students to take any 
single course in these lines. 
When courses pursued by 5 per cent or less are 
included, the proportions of the total credit covered 
increase notably only in the three subject-groups, two 
of these being music and the occupational. Conclu- 
‘sions drawn for the problem in hand would have 
additional corroboration from the contrasts if space 
could be spared here for the data resulting from such 
computations. 
The figures for all subjects show that in the total 
of 17,4954 quarter-hours of work taken by the two 
hundred students, a range of 10704 hours of courses 
is represented. For those accustomed to the semester 
plan it may be more meaningful to say that a total 
range of 713.7 semester-hours of different courses is 
represented. This amount exceeds the range of offer- 
ing in the average college by almost 400 hours and 
that of the average university by somewhat less than 
200 hours. However, of this total range 5404 quarter- 
hours, or slightly more than 50 per cent, are taken by 
2 per cent or less of the two hundred students, and 
679% quarter-hours, or 63.5 per cent, by’5 per cent or

less. In terms of semester-hours this means that if the 
courses represented were removed from the offering in 
this institution, the total represented in remaining 
courses taken by larger numbers of students would be 
reduced to 353.4 and 260.7 hours respectively. Thus 
only 4.8 per cent and 12.0 per cent, respectively, of 
the total credit would be involved. Therefore it does 
not seem to be beyond the bounds of reasonable ex- 
pectation to assume that the total offering of regular 
college work in junior colleges can be kept to some- 
thing like 250 semester-hours without sacrificing the 
interests of those who contemplate completion of a 
four-year liberal-arts curriculum. The lower total of 
semester-hours just referred to, 260.7, is not far in 
excess of the average for public junior colleges as 
previously indicated, even when this is reduced by 
ro per cent for courses not going forward. In view of 
the recency of the junior-college movement and the 
modest enrollment of many units, with relatively small 
proportions in the second year, and in view of the fact 
that the offerings to freshmen and sophomores in 
standard colleges, as analyzed for this study, are 
padded by courses seldom if ever taken by under- 
classmen, the writer feels secure in concluding that the 
stronger junior colleges—if not already prepared to 
do so—will shortly be able, as far as the curriculum 
is concerned, to realize their ambition of offering the 
first two years of college work. 
[44]

  THE OFFERING 
The appropriate offering for the purpose in ques- 
tion. It remains to afford this conclusion of feasibility 
the additional corroboration of suggesting within the 
scope of approximately 225 to 250 semester-hours a 
' junior-college offering likely to meet the requirements 
of the situation. Since the analysis of work actually 
taken as here reported concerns an institution in the 
Middle West, the work suggested is that which would 
be more adaptable to the needs of the same section, 
although it will be seen to be adaptable, with minor 
modifications, to most other sections. The proposals 
are based on careful consideration of the offerings and 
prescriptions in the colleges of liberal arts spoken of 
in earlier portions of this chapter. The courses listed 
are for the most part those appearing with greatest 
frequency in the offerings of separate colleges, more 
especially institutions in the Middle West. The 
amounts of credit assigned are likewise determined in 
most instances by the typical numbers of semester- 
hours assigned to them in the college offerings. The 
list is not presented to be defended against other pro- 
posals, but as one likely to meet, for a group of stu- 
dents representing a legitimate range of liberal-arts 
needs and interests, the requirements of the function 
under consideration. In order to meet the require- 
ments of many colleges and universities the usual 
offering in physical training should be added to the 
list.

Total 225 
The estimate of total range of credit involved in 
offering the courses listed is seen to be 225 semester- 
hours. Some may see portions of the offering which 
might be dispensed with in particular situations. 
Among these might be one of the courses in literature 
listed under English, the most advanced course in 
French, as much as from 5 to 10 semester-hours of the 
offerings in science, two or three courses in history, 
and one in the philosophy group. Such a reduction 
would bring the total down to something like 200 
semester-hours or slightly less, but each step in cur- 
tailment might affect disadvantageously a group of 
students whose interests command recognition. The 
[47]
-P-A-G-E-60
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
desirable situation implies avoiding an offering that is 
in essence a fully prescribed curriculum; it demands 
one sufficiently elastic to permit preparation for a 
variety of arrangements of the upper-class curriculum 
of the liberal-arts college. 
Some may feel that the offering should include other 
courses found available with considerable frequency 
for freshmen and sophomores in standard colleges, 
but not listed here, and that these should be either 
added to those suggested or, in certain instances, sub- 
stituted for some of those named. Among such courses 
there are, under English and public speaking, the 
novel, the short story, nineteenth-century poetry, and 
argumentation and debate; under foreign language, 
French or German conversation and Spanish; under 
science, general biology, plant physiology or mor- 
phology, elementary physics, astronomy, and geology ; 
and in social subjects, money and banking, municipal 
government, etc. It would not be difficult to recom- 
mend fifty to seventy-five more semester-hours of 
work drawn from this supplementary list which might 
fit the needs of no negligible number of students con- 
templating continuation in colleges of liberal arts. 
The offering as listed includes in foreign languages 
four college years of French and two of German. Most 
colleges add work in Latin and Spanish to this offering. 
Courses in the former have been omitted because rela- 
tively few students in the typical Mid-Western college 
[48]
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE OFFERING 
are at present enrolled in classes in Latin, and because 
in junior colleges where it is offered classes infre- 
quently materialize. Spanish is omitted because it is 
felt that work in two modern foreign languages will 
suffice. If Spanish is substituted for German, the ex- 
tent of the offering in foreign language might need to 
be increased, because students now often enter college 
with two high-school years of Spanish. The disappear- 
ance of German from high-school programs obviates 
the necessity of offering more than two years of that 
language in the junior college. Since college freshmen 
in the Middle West seldom offer more than two years 
of French for entrance, in some situations it would 
be gratuitous to offer more than the three college years 
of that language. 
III. THE Junior CoLttece aND PREPROFESSIONAL 
"REQUIREMENTS 
The problem and the procedure in studying it. The 
second aspect of the feasibility of giving in the junior 
college two years of work acceptable to colleges and 
universities is, like that just canvassed, one of major 
importance to the junior-college movement. The 
question here is, Can the junior college offer and give 
effectively the first two years of work in training 
toward the professions, both in preprofessional cur- 
ricula (for example, pre-legal and pre-medical) and in 
the freshman and sophomore years of professional 
[49]
-P-A-G-E-62
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
curricula open to the student upon completion of his 
high-school work (for example, agriculture and engi- 
neering)? Unable to give this work, the friends of 
the junior college could hardly lay claim to be foster- 
ing a unit that will play more than a minor réle in the 
educational system. It is perhaps needless to point out 
that, in addition to being important, the study of this 
aspect of the problem must be at least fully as complex 
and difficult as that which has just been canvassed. 
With the aim of providing a basis for answering this 
question with something like finality, an extended 
study was made of such curricula in a wide variety of 
professional lines—in point of fact, eighteen. Most 
of the occupations not included are infrequently rep- 
resented in higher institutions or are fairly well repre- 
sented by the curricula for some other profession 
which has been included. A few of those included 
concern a relatively small proportion of any possible 
student body in junior colleges generally, either now 
or in the future. 
A total of two hundred and thirty curricula are rep- 
resented in the tabulations made to canvass the feasi- 
bility of providing in the junior college the offering 
necessary to qualify on the criterion in question. This 
is an average of more than twelve curricula for each 
of the lines represented. The numbers of curricula 
per professional line are not, however, equal, as they 
range from four to twenty-eight. The smaller num- 
[50]
-P-A-G-E-63
  
THE OFFERING 
bers of curricula are to be explained usually by the 
relatively small numbers of institutions offering train- 
ing for the occupations, but occasionally by the small 
proportions of catalogues used in which the curricula 
were reported in detail or by years. The curricula 
used are those of standard institutions in all sections 
of the country. Most of these are universities on pri- 
vate or public foundations; but for lines like agricul- 
ture and home economics it was necessary to draw 
upon larger state agricultural and mechanical colleges, 
some of which, in range and character of work offered, 
will compare favorably with some institutions known 
as universities. 
Distinction between general and special subjects 
and courses. To facilitate consideration of the feasi- 
bility of giving in junior colleges the work listed, it 
was found desirable to divide it into two large groups 
which are designated as general and special, marking 
out, at least roughly, a distinction between the mate- 
rials of general and specialized education. Under the 
former class have been grouped most prescribed work 
in English; foreign language; mathematics through 
calculus ; most courses in the social studies, including 
only first courses in economics; philosophy ; psychol- 
ogy; and all courses in “pure” science. Here have 
been counted also all elective portions of curricula 
where these may be selected from nonspecial fields. 
In the second class have been placed all such materials 
[51]
-P-A-G-E-64
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
in the fields named as bore evidence of being for spe- 
cial groups or were clearly “applied” courses, such as 
“business” English, mathematics of investment, agri- 
cultural chemistry, educational psychology, etc. Here 
also were placed all courses in commerce in advance of 
the first course in economics. Far the larger propor- 
tion, however, of this class was made up of work in 
such special lines as pharmacy, education, agriculture, 
home economics, engineering, and the like.

  THE OFFERING 
Practically without exception what has been classed 
as general is comprehended by the minimum liberal- 
arts offering suggested for junior colleges near the 
close of the preceding section of the current chapter. 
This means that all general portions of these pre- 
professional requirements could be met by an offering 
of the sort proposed, the residual problem in meeting 
all the requirements of any particular preprofessional 
line here under consideration being that of providing 
in addition the special content. 
All general requirements. (1) Assuming that the 
average total requirement, exclusive of physical and 
military training during the two junior-college years, 
is sixty semester-hours or slightly above (in some 
curricula in agriculture, engineering, etc. it runs as 
high as seventy), the study made shows that the fol- 
lowing groups of students could meet all or essentially 
all of their requirements of the first two years, pro- 
fessional or preprofessional, in junior colleges with a 
general offering of the subjects and courses already 
specified: law, medicine, dentistry (two-year prepro- 
fessional or combination curricula), nursing (degree 
curricula), education, journalism, and chemistry. The 
requirement of the one-year pre-dental course could 
be fully met. (2) Approximately from two thirds to 
three fourths of the prescriptions in the following 
groups could be met: commerce, agriculture, home 
economics, and all engineering groups excepting chem- 
[53]
-P-A-G-E-66
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
ical engineering and architecture. (3) A somewhat 
larger proportion could be met in chemical engineer- 
ing. (4) In pharmacy, forestry, and architecture only 
about half of the requirements could be met. If no 
special work could be offered in junior colleges, stu- 
dents interested in the lines represented in (2), (3), 
and (4) as here grouped would need to transfer to 
the professional schools or other higher institutions 
at the end of the first year. 
Further assurance that strong junior colleges of 
good size could meet the general requirements as 
far as here estimated is afforded by scrutiny of the 
present-day junior-college offerings themselves, espe- 
cially those of the public and state types. This assur- 
ance is provided not only by the amounts of work 
given in each of the main fields, as already shown in 
the preceding section of this chapter, but also by the 
tests of particular courses in each of these fields, space 
for the presentation of which could not be spared in 
this volume. 
Special requirements. From what has already been 
indicated the professions requiring consideration un- 
der the head of special requirements are commerce ; 
pharmacy; agriculture; forestry; home economics; 
civil, electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineer- 
ing; mining; and architecture. 
The average amount of special work in the curricula 
in commerce is 12.6 semester-hours, and this require- 
[54] 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
THE OFFERING 
ment is more frequently distributed to courses in 
accounting and commercial geography and less fre- 
quently to courses in money and banking, statistics, 
the theory of investments, and business English. 
There can be little question of the practicability of 
providing fully for the group of students who plan to 
continue work in university schools of commerce upon 
the completion of their junior-college work. Stronger 
public junior colleges are already giving the equiva- 
lent, in amount at least, of the necessary special 
courses. 
The average amount of special work in curricula 
in pharmacy is practically half the total work the en- 
rolled student takes during his first two years. This 
high average resulted from a tabulation of the first 
two years of three-year (two cases) and four-year 
(six cases) curricula. Those conversant with curricula 
in this field will know that in these four-year and 
sometimes even in the three-year programs the profes- 
sional work is often placed in the first two years, and 
the general work for the most part in the upper years. 
This reversal of the usual procedure in training for the 
professions is owing to the desire of those contem- 
plating entrance to this occupation to achieve their 
objective in a short period of two years and their 
unwillingness to defer entrance to occupational activ- 
ity until they have completed a four-year curriculum. 
Some of them, however, do subsequently aspire to a 
[55]
-P-A-G-E-68
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
degree, and for them the longer curricula have been 
provided. This situation is probably not what those 
in charge of schools of pharmacy prefer. It is thus 
conceivable that these authorities would be ready to 
accept the general training if it were taken in junior 
colleges before the student entered upon the more 
strictly special work in the curricula in pharmacy. 
Moreover, schools of pharmacy now in existence 
seem for the present to have no difficulty in caring for 
all those seeking to enter this occupation, and it does 
not appear necessary or desirable, therefore, for the 
junior college (except perhaps in an occasional local 
situation) to endeavor in the immediate future to give 
the amount of special training found to be prescribed 
in the first two years of three-year and four-year cur- 
ricula in this field. Should pharmacy evolve to the 
professional level (this level being determined by the 
requirement for entrance of at least four years of 
training beyond high-school graduation), as leaders in 
the field are disposed to believe it will, the junior col- 
lege will be in a position to serve it preprofessionally 
just as it can now serve law and medicine. Should 
this genuinely professional level prove unattainable, 
and preparation for pharmacy remain on its present 
typically semiprofessional level (involving only two 
years of training beyond the high school), the full 
advent of junior-college reorganization will allocate 
curricula in pharmacy to the junior-college units. In 
[56 ] 
   
-P-A-G-E-69
  THE OFFERING 
the latter event the relatively small proportion which 
students in this line bear to all those enrolled in higher 
institutions will make it necessary to establish the 
work in at most a very few junior-college centers in 
any state. Perhaps even a single center will suffice. 
Either eventuation can be served by the junior college, 
as it seems probable that rapid junior-college reorgani- 
zation will even hasten the clarification of issues tend- 
ing to confuse the problem of training for this line 
of work. 
The average amounts of special work in the first 
two years of curricula in agriculture, forestry, and 
home economics do not differ widely, being, respec- 
tively, 29.0, 34.0, and 23.6 semester-hours. The 
courses more frequently entering to make up the 
special content for agriculture during freshman and 
sophomore years are agricultural chemistry, field or 
farm crops, horticulture, soils, live stock, and dairy 
and poultry husbandry, although there are many de- 
partures from this list. Most of these courses are of 
an elementary or introductory character. Although a 
few junior colleges are offering work of this nature, 
for the most part even the public junior colleges can- 
not qualify at the present writing, owing to the fact 
that they are usually to be found in cities of good size 
where there is little demand for special work of this 
kind. The proportion of students in any cross section 
of prospective enrollment in all lines the country over 
[57] 
   
-P-A-G-E-70
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
may be shown to be considerable, and any complete 
plan of junior-college reorganization cannot lose sight 
of them. 
There is no reason to believe that the work con- 
cerned cannot be given in junior-college units espe- 
cially equipped and manned forit. In anystatesystem 
of junior colleges the needs of this group could be 
conserved by establishing this special line of work in 
association with strong high schools serving territory 
with interests of a rural and agricultural character. 
The situation as to forestry differs from that in 
agriculture chiefly in that the proportion of students 
likely to be concerned is much more nearly negligible, 
and that as yet no junior college introduces this work 
into its total offering. Since it is desirable in certain 
states to provide training for this type of activity, that 
portion specifically occupational could be offered in 
one or two junior-college centers contiguous to the 
region most needing the service. Pending complete 
reorganization of secondary and higher education 
along junior-college lines, those students who plan to 
enter forestry would find it necessary to transfer from 
the junior college at the end of the first year. 
Public junior colleges would need practically to 
double their average offerings in home economics to 
take care adequately of the first two years of four- 
year curricula in this field. The offerings in private 
junior colleges are already almost adequate in extent 
[58]
-P-A-G-E-71
  
THE OFFERING 
and character, a situation explained by the fact that 
these institutions are so predominantly for women 
only. As junior colleges come to extend the materials 
of instruction for those young women who will con- 
clude their education in the junior-college period, they 
will open up more work in this field and will at the 
same time bring completely within the realm of feasi- 
bility the giving of the first two years of curricula in 
home economics. 
As the engineering group of students constitute a 
large proportion of any large total number of students 
taking work on the level of the first two college years 
—approximately a seventh or eighth of all—their 
needs must be met in any thoroughgoing reorganiza- 
tion involving universal institution of the junior- 
college plan. Although the first two years of the 
curriculum in chemistry can be cared for with little or 
no difficulty by an offering exclusively general in char- 
acter, a full eighth of the lower half of the curriculum 
in chemical engineering is special, a third of those in 
civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering and in 
mining is special, and half of that in architecture is 
special. The special content of a graphic nature is 
descriptive geometry and a greater or less amount of 
mechanical, machine, or engineering drawing and de- 
sign; the more common types of shop and related 
work are woodworking, forging, foundry, machine 
shop, and pattern-making; and the almost usual 
[59] 
 
-P-A-G-E-72
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
courses in engineering proper are surveying, me- 
chanics, and, often, materials of construction. A com- 
parison of these prescriptions with the junior-college 
offerings shows that the latter, although a little short, 
approximate the special requirements of all but the 
curricula in mining and architecture. Even though 
they do not fully qualify, the situation is flattering 
when the youth of the junior-college movement is 
considered. The apparent partial lacks are foundry 
practice in the list of shop courses, and in mechanics 
and materials of construction in the list of engineering 
courses. The facts that even these are given in some 
junior colleges (albeit a small number), and that 
many in the engineering field do not question the prac- 
ticability of giving the work in strong junior-college 
units, give promise that under proper supervision the 
junior college can and will do all the work of the first 
two years of most engineering curricula. The excep- 
tions most likely to present themselves are mining and 
architecture. As with forestry, the numbers and pro- 
portions of students concerned are not large, and there 
is no reason to believe that the solution of the problem 
of making the work available cannot be similar to that 
suggested in discussing forestry. 
Before leaving consideration of the group of engi- 
neering professions, reference should be made to cur- 
rent movements to lengthen the periods of training 
beyond their present typical duration. As this comes

THE OFFERING 
to be achieved the unspecialized content at the lower 
end of the curricula is almost certain to be enlarged, 
and as this enlargement takes place the giving in 
junior colleges of the first two years of work will 
become increasingly feasible. 
Summary. From the presentation just concluded it 
may be assumed that strong junior colleges should 
find no insurmountable difficulty in endeavoring to 
provide satisfactorily for the following professional 
groups: 
A, By two years of work exclusively or almost exclusively general 
rather than special: 
1. Law (pre-legal or combination curricula) 
2. Medicine (pre-medical or combination curricula) 
3. Dentistry (pre-dental or combination curricula) 
5. Nursing (pre-nursing or combination curricula) 
7. Education (pre-education or first two years of four-year or 
five-year curricula) 
g. Journalism 
17. Chemistry 
B. By two years of work usually for the most part general, but 
also in considerable part special, usually the first two years of four- 
year curricula: 
8. Commerce 
to. Agriculture 
12. Home economics 
13. Civil engineering 
14. Electrical engineering 
15. Mechanical engineering 
16. Chemical engineering. 
C. By a one-year professional curriculum exclusively general, 
until the two-year preprofessional curriculum is fully established: 
4. Dentistry (pre-dental curriculum) 
[ 61 J   
   
-P-A-G-E-74
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
D. By one year of general work applicable to professional cur- 
ricula, until the place of the occupation in question either as a pro- 
fession or as a semiprofession is established. 
6. Pharmacy (in the case of some four-year curricula in pharmacy 
two years of such general work should be acceptable) 
E. By one year of general work applicable to professional cur- 
ricula, until the junior-college plan is thoroughly established and par- 
ticular junior-college units (few in number because of the small 
proportion of students concerned) are specially equipped and manned 
to give the two full years of work, or until curricula are modified to 
prescribe a larger proportion of work of a general nature: 
11. Forestry 
18. Mining 
1g. Architecture 
With the more general availability of opportunities 
of education on the junior-college level, it is almost 
certain that the first two years of curricula in the lines 
here found to contain considerable special material 
will move in the direction of more general content, as 
is already true for the older professions. In the mean- 
time the special offerings will need to be made if the 
student is to remain in the junior college for two years 
and also complete the professional curricula in the 
scheduled period of years. 
It is well to point out again the fact that the de- 
scription here provided is in terms of the typical re- 
quirements, rather than of the variations from the 
typical. The fact of variation complicates for the 
adviser of students in the junior college the task of 
recommending courses to meet the requirements of a 
number of different higher institutions. It compli- 
[ 62 ]
-P-A-G-E-75
  THE OFFERING 
cates even more the work of planning a satisfactory 
junior-college offering. Giving in the junior college 
the special content in all these professional lines will 
be much facilitated by a better standardization of the 
curricula in them. This process of standardization is 
itself likely to be accelerated by the advent of the 
junior-college plan.

Importance of the comparison. As was made clear 
near the opening of the foregoing chapter, in which 
consideration was given to the feasibility of offering 
in the junior college two years of work acceptable to 
colleges of liberal arts, there is implicit in the claim 
the belief that the work can be effectively done in the 
new unit. A few of the sources drawn upon for the 
current conceptions of special purposes of the junior 
college went even farther than merely to imply it, as 
may be seen in Chapter II, which shows that at least a 
few friends of the junior college made so bold as to 
assert that it would offer better instruction in these 
school years than is afforded in other higher institu- 
tions, the chief ground cited for the conviction being 
that the more seasoned high-school instructors se- 
lected for junior-college work are more effective teach- 
ers than are the younger, less experienced instructors 
often employed in colleges and universities. 
[ 64 ]
-P-A-G-E-77
INSTRUCTORS AND INSTRUCTION 
Whatever may be the merit of this particular con- 
tention, it is clearly essential to an evaluation of the 
movement that as complete and unbiased an inquiry 
into junior-college instruction as could be made with- 
out sacrificing other vital portions should be included. 
No educational unit could long justify its existence 
without effective teaching ; and if junior-college teach- 
ing shows no promise of becoming efficient, to the 
degree at least of the instruction afforded on this level 
by its predecessors in the field, there would be meager 
occasion to argue for the extension of the movement 
on other grounds. 
Three chief methods were used in this portion of 
the investigation: first, a comparison as to training, 
experience, teaching-load, and remuneration of junior- 
college instructors with those giving instruction on 
the same level in colleges and universities; second, a 
comparison of the instruction itself by means of a 
large amount of classroom visitation; third, a com- 
parison of the efficiency of junior-college graduates in 
their first year of work in universities and colleges 
subsequently attended with that of students who had 
completed their first two years of work in a univer- 
sity. The method throughout, be it noted, is one of 
comparison. 
The highest degrees held. One measure of the ex- 
tent of preparation of an instructor, albeit a rough 
one, is the highest degree he holds. In a comparison 
[65] 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
of junior-college teachers with college and university 
teachers, when those giving instruction in special sub- 
jects like home economics, art, music, and physical 
training are omitted from both groups, a small per- 
centage in the former group are found to be without 
degrees, whereas in the college and university group 
there are none without such academic recognition. 
These exceptions among junior-college instructors are 
for the most part those who have had especially large 
amounts of preparation in fields they are teaching; 
for example, a small proportion of the teachers of 
French who are native to the language. Instructors 
in public junior colleges and Northern private junior 
colleges on the one hand, and those in colleges and 
universities on the other, in roughly equivalent pro- 
portions hold masters’ as their highest degrees. There 
is, however, a striking difference between the percent- 
ages holding bachelors’ and doctors’ degrees. Junior 
colleges have practically none of the latter, the differ- 
ence being almost balanced by the larger percent- 
age of those holding only bachelors’ degrees in the 
junior-college groups. As between public and North- 
ern private junior colleges, the former have some ex- 
tent of advantage. 
Amore nearly valid criterion for assisting in passing 
judgment on the satisfactoriness of preparation of 
junior-college teachers is a comparison with respect 
to the highest degrees held by those teachers in

courses taken characteristically by juniors and seniors. 
Of the college groups so restricted 40.9 per cent held 
bachelors’ as their highest degrees, 40.9 per cent held 
masters’ degrees, and only 18.2 per cent held doctors’ 
degrees. Of the university group 33.8 per cent held 
bachelors’ degrees, 55.4 per cent masters’ degrees, and 
10.8 per cent doctors’ degrees. These distributions 
are much more nearly like that for public junior col- 
leges, although they are still somewhat superior to it. 
They indicate that, when measured by degrees held 
by this group of instructors only, the standards opera- 
tive in higher institutions are less unattainable for 
junior colleges. 
High-school and junior-college teachers compared 
as to highest degrees held. It would probably be 
granted without argument that for teachers in junior 
colleges the percentages holding advanced degrees are 
larger than for those in standard high schools. Never- 
theless, to illustrate the extent of difference, some 
reference is here made to a study recently completed 
by Hutson," of the training of a large number of 
teachers in the high schools of Minnesota, a state which 
has for many years maintained relatively high stand- 
ards of preparation for high-school teachers. This 
study shows that in high schools with thirty or more

teachers only ro per cent have advanced degrees, and 
in high schools with eleven to twenty-nine teachers 
only 3.1 per cent are so equipped. It shows also, by 
citation from the results of an investigation made by 
Dean M. E. Haggerty, that almost all teachers of 
academic subjects in high schools of the state have 
been the recipients of bachelors’ degrees. These facts, 
compared with those pertaining to teachers in junior 
colleges, indicate that instructors in these new insti- 
tutions, as measured by degrees held, constitute a 
selected group, and that large proportions are well 
on their way from the typical level of training re- 
garded as essential for high-school teaching to that 
considered desirable for instruction of collegiate rank. 
Numbers of years of training received. A second 
measure of the total extent of preparation for teaching 
in the institutions represented is the total number of 
years of training received, including all undergraduate 
and graduate periods, not omitting summer sessions. 
The results are in harmony with the facts pertaining 
to the highest degrees held, in that they indicate the 
superiority in extent of training of instructors in col- 
leges and universities as compared with those in junior 
colleges, and in that instructors in public junior col- 
leges are again somewhat better trained than those in 
Northern private units. 
As in the instance of the highest degrees held, a 
special study was made of those college and university 
[ 69 ]
-P-A-G-E-82
    THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
instructors who were not giving instruction to upper- 
classmen, but to students on the junior-college level 
only. The median number of years of post-high- 
school training received by this group of college in- 
structors is 5.4, approximately a year less than for the 
whole group of college teachers giving instruction to 
students in these years. The difference for university 
teachers is much less marked, as the median for those 
giving instruction to students in junior-college years 
only is 6.0, whereas it is 6.3 for the whole group. The 
smaller difference for the university group is to be 
accounted for largely by the fact that some with con- 
siderable graduate training are part-time instructors 
who are satisfied with such a status in view of the pos- 
sibility of making further progress toward advanced 
degrees while teaching. 
Special preparation for the subjects taught and 
number of departments in which instructors teach. 
The question of preparation for teaching in junior 
colleges is not, however, solely one of degrees or the 
extent in years of the period of preparation. It is also 
a question of special preparation in the fields in which 
the teacher is giving instruction. If the basis of com- 
parison in this instance is the proportion of instructors 
having an undergraduate major or more in the sub- 
jects taught (and this can surely not be regarded as 
too high a standard of preparation), we find that in 
public junior colleges and Northern private junior 
[70]
-P-A-G-E-83
  INSTRUCTORS AND INSTRUCTION 
colleges approximately three fourths of the teachers 
have had this amount, the remainder having had less 
for a part or all of their teaching work. This propor- 
tion mounts to six sevenths for instructors in four-year 
colleges and to practically all in universities. The 
proportion leaves something still to be hoped for in

the training of teachers, not only in the new unit but 
also in the four-year colleges of liberal arts. 
A phase of the problem of securing adequate prepa- 
ration in subjects taught is the number of different 
departments in which the teacher is required to give 
instruction. This situation was also inquired into, the 
usual classification of departments in colleges being 
followed in the computations. Approximately three 
fifths of the instructors in public and Northern private 
[7] 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
junior colleges teach in one department only, some- 
thing more than a fourth teach in two departments, 
with small percentages giving instruction in more. In 
four-year colleges the proportion teaching in a single 
department rises to three fourths, with something 
more than a fifth teaching in two departments. Uni- 
versity instructors teach exclusively in one depart- 
ment. It appears that the junior college is not the only 
type of higher institution in which instructors must 
carry work in more than one department, standard 
four-year colleges also struggling with the problem of 
a spread of the teacher’s work. 
The facts so far presented touching the extent of 
preparation for subjects taught and the number of 
different departments in which teachers are required 
to give instruction lead naturally to the question of 
whether there are not variations among the subjects 
as to amounts of preparation; that is, whether in cer- 
tain lines instructors are not characteristically better 
prepared than in certain others. An inquiry on this 
point shows that almost three fourths of the teachers 
of English in junior colleges have had either a gradu- 
ate major or both graduate and undergraduate majors 
in that subject, and the proportions for French and 
chemistry are even greater. In three other subjects, 
namely, economics, political science, and sociology, 
the percentages are only 15.4, 10.0, and 37.5 respec- 
tively. This contrast presents a serious situation. 
[72] 
 
-P-A-G-E-85
    
INSTRUCTORS AND INSTRUCTION 
The difficulty seems to be one arising out of the rela- 
tively small extent of total offering in some subjects 
as compared with others. No one will desire to con- 
tend that these subjects in which teachers typically 
show meager preparation should be omitted from the 
offering, the curriculum to be restricted to English, 
foreign language, a few courses in science, and mathe- 
matics. Nor will there be advocates of having them 
taught by persons insufficiently prepared. The way 
out, if we are to have junior colleges, must lie in other 
directions. 
Training in education. ‘The last aspect of the train- 
ing of instructors to be dealt with concerns the work 
they have had in the field of education. The differ- 
ences here are notably in favor of the junior-college 
groups. The median amounts for teachers in public 
and Northern private junior colleges are 16.2 and 21.5 
semester-hours respectively ; for those in colleges and 
universities they are 5.0 and 1.8. This large differ- 
ence is a reflection of the fact that the former have 
much more largely than the latter come from the ranks 
of high-school teachers, who must in most states and 
in most teacher-training institutions meet certain 
minimum requirements in the field. 
The teaching-load. But general and special prepa- 
ration of instructors is not the sole determinant of the 
feasibility of giving instruction in an educational in- 
stitution. Consideration must be given also to condi- 
[73]

tions under which the work goes forward. One of 
these is the total amount of instructional activity 
required—the teaching-load. Where this is unduly 
large it is impossible for a teacher to do good work.

Experience. Another factor generally conceded to 
be of some importance in evaluating possibilities of 
effective instruction on the junior-college level is the 
extent of the instructor’s experience. Perhaps the 
most significant measure of experience which can be 
reported for the purposes of this volume is the number

must have less meaning for teaching on the junior-

junior colleges take the superior position (with a 
median of 9.1 years), and this is because a larger 
proportion of them have had extended experience 
in high-school teaching before entering upon junior-

college work. They are closely followed by instruc- 
tors in four-year colleges (8.9 years). The lowest 
amount is that for teachers in universities (4.2 years), 
although it does not drop far below that for private 
junior colleges (5.0 years). It appears that a full 
half of the university group have had 4.2 or more years 
of related experience, which is far from saying that 
the majority of those who give instruction to under- 
classmen in universities are “inexperienced.” 
If experience in present and in related positions 
counts for anything in effectiveness of classroom pro- 
cedure, we are justified in anticipating that in this 
respect teachers in public junior colleges will at least 
not fall below those in other higher institutions. 
Remuneration. Last in this canvass of factors con- 
ditioning the effectiveness of instruction in the several 
types of institution represented comes the item of 
salaries received. The significant relationship here 
is, of course, that if junior-college salaries cannot 
compare favorably with those paid in colleges and 
universities, the new unit will not be able to secure 
instructors as well equipped in matters of training and 
satisfactory experience as are those employed in the 
older types of institution. 
The tendency is for public junior colleges to pay 
better salaries than do private units, even after proper 
allowances are made for board and room, if these are 
provided as a part of the remuneration. Salaries in the

former are appreciably but not markedly less than in

of instructors teaching courses to under-classmen in

the salary distribution in these. The exceptions rise

out of the fact that some men of high rank in univer- 
sities have teaching responsibility for courses taken by 
freshmen and sophomores, with instances of salaries 
ranging up to $5000 and $6000. 
A comparison of the figures for instructors in public 
junior colleges with those in high schools is likewise 
(77]
-P-A-G-E-90
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
illuminating. It shows that there is some tendency 
to difference between high-school and junior-college 
instructors in the same districts—a median difference 
of something like $250. High schools in cities of the 
same size and general region in which junior colleges 
are not maintained pay salaries considerably lower 
than do those with junior colleges, which leads to 
at least one conclusion of significance—that junior- 
college work is as a rule not introduced until a district 
has already taken care in a relatively satisfactory way 
of work on the lower level. It is worth noting that 
_ salaries in Northern private junior colleges range be- 
tween those in high schools in districts maintaining 
junior colleges and those in high schools in districts 
not maintaining them. 
The general conclusion from these facts as they 
concern public junior colleges is that salaries in them 
do not compare unfavorably with salaries in other 
higher institutions. It should not be impossible to 
secure at the figures cited some teachers who will do 
very well the work of junior-college instruction. On 
the other hand, it is desirable to raise the general level 
further to some extent: first, because for some years 
to come it will still be regarded as more honorific to 
be a member of a staff of a four-year college or a uni- 
versity, and, secondly, because the junior college does 
not afford, as does the university, the opportunity for 
further graduate study. 
[ 78 ]

    INSTRUCTORS AND INSTRUCTION 
Summary and implications on training, experience, 
remuneration, etc. The trend of the facts presented 
is such as to afford assurance of the ultimate efficacy 
of instructional work in the junior college. In the 
matter of degrees held and duration of periods of train- 
ing, to be sure, the colleges and universities lead the 
junior colleges at a considerable distance, but from 
the standpoint of the brief history of the movement 
the progress of the new unit is to be regarded as com- 
mendable. With respect to the special preparation of 
instructors for subjects taught, the junior colleges 
also make a fair showing, but they lag somewhat be- 
hind their predecessors in the collegiate field, the in- 
adequacy lying for the most part in subjects of which 
the students take lesser amounts during their first two 
years of college work. Commendation for progress, 
however, should hardly be interpreted as signifying 
satisfaction with the status quo, and there should be 
continued insistence on an approach to and attain- 
ment of standards as these are seen to be operative in 
colleges and universities. 
In training in the field of education, in experience, 
in teaching-load, and in salaries, instructors in junior 
colleges compare somewhat more favorably with those 
in other higher institutions than they do in the fore- 
going items. In training in the field of education the 
junior-college instructor notably surpasses the instruc- 
tor in the college and university, and in experience he 
[79]
-P-A-G-E-92
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
surpasses him appreciably. After all apologies are 
made for the varying quality of both, there remains 
an expectation that observation of much classroom 
work in both types of unit would demonstrate a 
somewhat superior instructional procedure for the 
junior college. The teaching-load is not essentially 
different in public junior colleges from what it is in 
four-year colleges, but it is somewhat larger than in 
universities. While remuneration is not as large for 
junior-college teachers, the present disparity is not 
discouraging. It will take no extraordinary elevation 
of salaries of the middle group as shown to assure 
something like successful competition with colleges 
and universities for instructors. 
It must be admitted, as the reader has perhaps dis- 
cerned, that the favorable light in which junior col- 
leges are placed in the comparisons envelops the public 
institutions more than the private institutions. It 
must in all fairness be emphatically stated, however, 
that this is far from saying that all public junior col- 
leges are superior in these respects to all private junior 
colleges. Some of the latter are clearly superior to 
certain of the former in most of the items on which 
facts have been presented. The conclusion to be 
‘drawn is that the trend of superiority is with the 
public unit. 
This section should not be brought to a close with- 
out reference to certain implications of the facts pre-

INSTRUCTORS AND INSTRUCTION 
sented. The first two of these concern the means of 
achieving further progress toward securing teachers 
with better preparation in some of the fields repre- 
sented in an adequate junior-college offering. Both 
recommendations may well be used in identical in- 
stances. One of these recommendations is to encour- 
age the establishment of only sizable junior-college 
units. Establishment of institutions with small en- 
rollments either must obstruct the offering of many 
subjects essential to a desirable curriculum or else 
require their presentation by teachers inadequately 
prepared in them. Larger attendance will go far to 
remove both horns of this dilemma. 
The second recommendation is that accrediting 
agencies should not merely acquiesce in but actually 
encourage the assignment of instructors to work on 
both junior-college and high-school levels. It is cer- 
tainly preferable to require teaching in a single de- 
partment in various grades, including the last two 
high-school and the freshman and sophomore col- 
lege years, rather than to require a spread of the 
teaching-load to departments for which an instruc- 
tor has had insufficient preparation. The argument 
of contamination of the instructor by contact with 
high-school standards of work is little more than 
bogeyism, and seems to ignore entirely the analogous 
contamination which the credulous might be induced 
to believe is experienced when one who teaches senior 
[ 8r ]  
-P-A-G-E-94
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
college classes gives instruction also to college fresh- 
men and sophomores. The writer’s observation of 
work done by those who teach on both levels leads him 
to believe that it can be done, and in many instances 
is now being done, without violation of “college stand- 
ards,” and that it often effects an elevation in the 
standards of high-school work—a value worth bearing 
in mind. 
Above and beyond this advantage of fostering ade- 
quate preparation for a specialty by encouraging the 
teaching of a subject on both high-school and junior- 
college levels lies one suggested by the more extended 
training in educational subjects of teachers in junior 
colleges. Many of these—most of them, in fact—are 
also teaching courses in the high school and are there- 
fore meeting the requirements of high-school certi- 
fication in accredited schools, which now almost 
universally, in regions where public junior colleges 
are present, include training in the professional field 
referred to. Should there be an effort to apply a 
standard to junior colleges which would reduce the 
proportion of those giving instruction on both levels, 
there would almost certainly follow a reduction in the 
proportion meeting this requirement of certification 
and an increase of those who have had no regularly 
appointed opportunity for considering educational 
and teaching problems. In view of the degree of 
similarity—even of identity—of these problems in 
[ 82 ]
-P-A-G-E-95
  INSTRUCTORS AND INSTRUCTION 
the last two years of the high school and the first two 
years of college, such a reduction could hardly fail to 
be looked upon as in the nature of a retrogression. 
There seems little occasion for the belief that the 
training of teachers for the last years of the high 
school should be essentially different either in this 
respect or in the matter of the extent of special prepa- 
ration for the subjects taught. In the latter respect 
the later high-school years would profit by the more 
extended preparation essential for junior-college 
teaching. 2 
II. INstRUCTION OBSERVED 
The method of comparison used. The right pro- 
cedure to follow in any thoroughgoing comparison 
of instruction in junior colleges and on the junior- 
college level in standard colleges and universities 
would be the measurement of results by tests of 
achievement in each of the subjects represented. It is 
needless to point out that such a procedure is impos- 
sible. The impossibility arises from the fact that such 
tests are not yet available for use. Lacking tests of 
this sort in any considerable proportion of the courses 
to be found in junior-college years, recourse was taken 
to comparative judgments of instruction observable 
in junior colleges and in junior-college years of stand- 
ard colleges and universities. 
[ 83] 
   
-P-A-G-E-96
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
A total of one hundred and eleven class exercises 
were observed in junior colleges and forty-one in 
standard four-year colleges and universities—all but 
a score of them throughout the full period, and in the 
exceptions never less than three fourths of the full 
period. Thirty-nine junior colleges are represented, 
scattered from New England to California and from 
Minnesota to Louisiana. Three colleges and three 
universities (two state and one on a private founda- 
tion) were visited during the observation of the latter 
group. These six institutions are fully approved by 
the standardizing agencies in their respective sections, 
with their degrees generally acceptable at face value’ 
in all sections of the United States. On the other 
hand, several of the junior colleges were not accredited 
institutions, a fact which makes the comparison to 
follow in some degree unfair to the latter group of 
institutions. No effort was made in visits either to 
junior colleges or to other higher institutions to 
observe a selected group of teachers, the aim being 
to secure a random representation of junior-college 
instruction and of instruction on the same level in 
colleges and universities. The same person made all 
the observations here concerned. 
The judgments of teachers and teaching were ar- 
rived at by the use of a modification of a method and 
score-card proposed by Rugg and described in the 
[84]
-P-A-G-E-97
INSTRUCTORS AND INSTRUCTION 
Elementary School Journal.’ This scale requires pass- 
ing judgment on a basis strictly comparative, a scale of 
teachers or class exercises being made for each cate- 
gory under consideration, and each teacher observed 
being rated by comparison with the scale for each 
category. Although the judgments made covered a 
number of different categories, only the three most 
significant for present purposes will be reported upon ; 
namely, skill in teaching, scholarship of the instructor 
as manifested during the class exercise, and the level 
of class performance. 
Comparison of skill in teaching in junior colleges 
and in colleges and universities. The ranks assigned 
to the observed class exercises of colleges and univer- 
sities on skill in teaching tend to be somewhat lower 
than for teachers in the junior colleges, but no large 
proportion of the teachers were ranked below “‘aver- 
age,” which has been given the rank of 3. A conserva- 
tive interpretation of the data assembled would be 
that classroom procedure in junior colleges is as- 
suredly on at least as high a plane as is instruction of 
freshmen in colleges and universities. The writer car- 
ries the conviction that such a conclusion is unfair to 
junior colleges, as he came away from his large amount

of classroom visitation in higher institutions with a 
distinct impression of the superiority of the junior 
colleges with respect to the item in question. There 
are, of course, very good and very poor teachers in 
both groups, but there is no doubt in the writer’s mind 
that junior-college teachers as a group are superior in 
technique. 
Scholarship of instructors. An examination, how- 
ever, of the data on the scholarship of instructors will 
make clear that the relation of superiority of the 
junior-college group in skill in teaching is here re- 
versed. The college and university group is notably 
better both as to percentage distribution and average 
of ranks assigned. This superiority may be illustrated 
by the fact that the college and university group in- 
cludes almost as many ranked as “best” as does the 
junior-college group, although the latter includes al- 
most three times the total number of cases. To be 
exact, fourteen of forty-one instructors in the colleges 
and universities were ranked as “‘best” in scholarship, 
whereas but fifteen of one hundred and eleven in the 
junior colleges were so ranked. 
Level of class performance. The distributions of 
ranks assigned to the class exercises on the level of 
class or student performance show a difference in favor 
of the junior college. While this difference is not large, 
it at least encourages the belief that the level of stu- 
dent performance in junior colleges is no lower than in 
[ 86 ]

classes in the same subject in other higher institutions, 
which leads to the conclusion that in the results ob- 
tained from students a superior skill in teaching will 
in some measure compensate for a partial lack in 
scholarship of the instructor in the subject taught.

Concurrence of the findings of this and the preced- 
ing section. The major conclusions of this compar- 
ative observation of classroom instruction in junior 
colleges and instruction on the same level in other 
higher institutions correspond closely with those 
drawn from the study of personnel presented in the 
section immediately preceding. In skill in teaching,

the group of junior-college instructors tend to be some- 
what superior. This finding is in harmony with the 
fact that most of them have had experience in an in- 
stitution in which, because of the relative immaturity 
  1 c 2 4 5

of its students, methods of teaching tend to be matters 
of greater concern than in higher institutions gener- 
ally, a difference reflected in the much larger extent 
of work in the special field of education reported by 
them. In the matter of scholarship in the subjects 
taught, on the other hand, the teachers in colleges and 
[ 88 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-101
INSTRUCTORS AND INSTRUCTION 
universities are superior to those in junior colleges,— 
a conclusion corresponding with the facts in the mat- 
ter of differences in the amount of preparation, both 
total and special. The findings of the two sections 
agree again in the line of most desirable progress,

and university; broken line, junior college) 
which is more extended preparation (than they now 
have) of junior-college teachers for the subjects in 
which they give instruction, this in turn involving 
more extended periods of graduate training. 
The implications also are the same as those drawn 
from the materials on personnel. They are in the di- 
rection of (1) favoring large rather than small junior- 
[ 89 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  _ THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
college units, so as to require larger teaching staffs, 
which in turn will encourage a higher degree of spe- 
cialization in preparation and instruction ; (2) encour- 
aging instructional activity on both upper high-school 
and junior-college levels, not only for the sake of ad- 
vantages like those accruing under (1) but also for 
the assurance that by such a distribution of instruc- 
tion those who do junior-college teaching will have 
given some special consideration during their periods 
of training to problems of education and technique of 
teaching. 
The tendency of the group of junior-college instruc- 
tors toward superiority of skill in teaching as com- 
pared with those in other higher institutions should 
be accepted as assurance that the line of division 
between secondary and higher education would be 
more satisfactorily placed if the secondary rather than 
the higher institutions included the early college years. 
There can be little question that close association of 
the lower years with the upper years in colleges and 
universities leads to a confusion of criteria for judging 
teachers and teaching in freshman and sophomore 
years. The domination of teaching-groups by stand- 
ards of research and other scholarly productivity— 
standards fully appropriate to upper and graduate 
years—must exercise a detrimental effect upon 
teaching-procedure in these lower years. The gen- 
eral establishment of junior colleges as parts of the 
[90]
-P-A-G-E-103
  INSTRUCTORS AND INSTRUCTION 
secondary-school system would go far toward clarify- 
ing these confusing issues by achieving dissociation at 
a point where it is highly desirable. There seems no 
occasion, on the other hand, to fear that the improve- 
ment in scholarship of junior-college teachers, found in 
this and the foregoing section still to be desirable, while 
giving them ample appreciation of the importance of 
research and some acquaintance with its methods, 
cannot be achieved without developing them unduly 
in this respect. 
A word may be addressed to those who are still 
disposed to wonder, after reading the last two sections, 
how junior-college teachers and teaching, when com- 
pared with teachers and teaching in colleges and uni- 
versities, can be as satisfactory as they are, especially 
in view of the youth of the movement. After all, it is 
seldom that junior-college work is established in school 
districts in which work of a relatively satisfactory 
sort has not already been provided in the lower 
schools. One item of evidence to this effect is the 
better level of salaries of high-school teachers in com- 
munities with public junior colleges than that in com- 
munities in which junior-college work is not given. As 
a general thing such salaries attract to these high 
schools teachers who are somewhat superior to those 
to be found where salaries are lower. Junior-college 
teachers are usually chosen from the most profes- 
sionally capable and ambitious of these selected 
[oz] 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
high-school teachers. Such a tendency toward the 
sifting-out of high-school teachers could hardly fail 
to result in a condition as satisfactory as the one 
found, although it might still leave something to be 
desired in the way of further additions to the average 
extent of graduate training. 
III. Success oF JuNtoR-CoLLEGE GRADUATES 
The third method of comparison. Another possible 
method of passing judgment on the merit of instruc- 
tion in junior colleges is that of comparing the scho- 
lastic success of graduates of these institutions who 
subsequently attend universities and colleges with 
that of students who have spent their first two years 
in these standard higher institutions and during that 
period have earned the right to junior standing. It 
may be judged that the making of such a comparison 
is hedged about by a great variety of difficulties, but 
the importance of obtaining some such measure of 
junior-college efficiency seemed to warrant the per- 
sistence necessary. 
The names of junior-college graduates represented 
in this comparison and the universities and colleges to 
which they transferred after completion of the work 
in the lower unit were assembled during visits to 
junior colleges. Care was exercised to secure the 
names of all such graduates who went on from some 
[92 ]
-P-A-G-E-105
  
INSTRUCTORS AND INSTRUCTION 
class finishing the junior-college course in each insti- 
tution. Registrars of the institutions to which they 
transferred were appealed to for the scholastic records 
of the junior-college graduates during their first year 
of subsequent attendance. Data of this sort were col- 
lected only for accredited junior colleges (that is, 
accredited usually by the state university or occasion- 
ally by some other recognized standardizing agency). 
The junior units in which these students did their first 
two years of college work were nineteen in number and 
include both public and private schools. More of the 
former are represented and by a larger number of 
students. The total number of junior-college gradu- 
ates considered in the final comparison, ninety-five, is 
divided almost equally between junior colleges of the 
Middle West and California. Thirteen different uni- 
versities and six colleges are represented in the data 
supplied concerning the scholastic success of junior- 
college graduates. With one exception the universi- 
ties are all members of the Association of American 
Universities. This institution and the six colleges are 
all on the approved list of higher institutions prepared 
by this association. The higher institutions report- 
ing on considerable numbers of students are the uni- 
versities of California, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, 
Southern California, and Wisconsin, Stanford and 
Washington universities, and Pomona College, with 
smaller numbers of students registered in other insti- 
[93] 
 
-P-A-G-E-106
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
tutions, such as the universities of Chicago, Iowa, 
Kansas, and Texas, and Columbia University. 
. The group of university students with which these 
junior-college graduates were compared were seventy- 
five who attended the University of Minnesota during 
three school years and who during the first two years 
earned the right, as determined by the number of 
_ credits and honor-points in their favor on the regis- 
trar’s books, to unconditional admission to the senior 
college ; that is, to full junior standing. 
It may be desirable to repeat here that this standing 
is achieved by students who earn at least ninety credit- 
hours (the equivalent of sixty semester-hours) and 
ninety honor-points in the junior college of the College 
of Science, Literature, and the Arts. One honor-point 
is given for each hour of credit with the mark of C, two 
for each hour of credit with the mark of B, and three 
for each hour of credit with the mark of A. Marks 
below C do not bring honor-points. It is not to be 
understood that all the students in the University of 
Minnesota group had been admitted to senior-college 
standing. A small proportion may not have met the 
requirements as to courses and groups of subjects. All 
had, however, the requisite total of credits and honor- 
points. These seventy-five students were those of a 
group of more than three hundred typical students 
who entered the university at the same time, most of 
the remainder having been eliminated before the end 
[94]
-P-A-G-E-107
  
  INSTRUCTORS AND INSTRUCTION 
of three school years or not having earned the credits 
and honor-points requisite for junior standing. 
Limitations of space forbid presentation of further 
details of procedure, such as the method of equating 
and weighting marks etc., except to indicate that in 
order to assure comparability of the groups, only those 
junior-college graduates were considered who were 
granted sixty or more (seldom more) semester-hours 
of advanced standing in the institutions to which they 
transferred. To have introduced those who were 
granted less than this amount would have been unfair 
to the junior-college group. 
The results of the comparison. While the percen- 
tages of average marks at identical points are seldom 
closely alike, the distributions as a whole are not suf- 
ficiently different to discredit either group in com- 
parison with the other. If one group has a lower 
percentage than the other at any point, the difference 
tends to be compensated for at neighboring points on 
the same side of the median. The medians themselves 
are not far apart, the difference, although slight (the 
difference only between 79.8 and 80.6), being in favor 
of the junior-college graduates. Computing theaverage 
deviation (a simple measure of variability ) for the two 
groups brings 5.6 for the junior-college graduates and 
5.4 for the University of Minnesota group, which again 
emphasizes their similarity of success. The conclusion 
to be drawn seems to be that there is no appreciable dif-

Concluding comments. In view of what has been

little occasion for surprise at the approximate equality

in the comparison. Certain portions of Chapter IV 
show the mental distributions of junior-college and 
state-university freshmen to be similar, arguing that 
the extent of selection for admission to college work is 
much the same in both. The curricular offerings dur- 
ing these years could not differ widely for the two 
groups of students; therefore, as far as the curriculum 
is a selective factor, it would operate with approximate 
equality on both groups. We have seen that although 
college and university teachers have better prepara- 
tion in subject matter, this advantage is in part offset 
by a higher level of teaching-skill in the junior college. 
There is no reason to anticipate much difference in the 
subsequent records of junior-college graduates owing 
to these distinctions. All things considered, there 
should be occasion for surprise if conditions with such 
a large extent of similarity resulted in notable differ- 
ences in the scholastic records during the third col- 
legiate year. 
IV. REcoGNITION oF JUNIOR CoLLEGES BY OTHER 
HicHER INsTITUTIONS 
Perhaps the final test of acceptability for advanced 
standing of work done in junior colleges is the extent 
of its actual acceptance by higher institutions. That 
a number of these are already recognizing the work 
done in accredited units is implicit in the material just 
[97]  
-P-A-G-E-110
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
reported in the foregoing section. Moreover, those in 
contact with the movement are aware that universities 
—at least those in the West and Middle West—are 
disposed to accept the work done in approved junior 
colleges and, even more, to look with favor on their 
rapid development. There has been some doubt on 
this score concerning separate four-year colleges, some 
of the authorities in charge of these institutions ap- 
pearing to entertain misgivings as to the bearing of 
the movement upon the future of the separate college. 
Asimple form of inquiry blank directed to the regis- 
trars of a large number of randomly selected separate 
colleges brought returns which, so far as acceptance 
of junior-college work is concerned, should be reassur- 
ing to the friends of the new movement. Of one hun- 
dred and sixty-eight responses received (most of these 
from recognized, but some from unrecognized col- 
leges), one hundred and eight (almost two thirds) 
report having received applications for advanced 
standing from junior-college students. All but four 
of these one hundred and eight institutions follow the 
practice of admitting such students to advanced stand- 
ing, the two predominant types of recognition being 
“hour for hour” and “for courses only open to fresh- 
men and sophomores” in the institution to which 
application is made. Ninety-one of the one hundred 
and four colleges follow these two types of recognition, 
forty-nine the former and forty-two the latter. A 
[98 ]
-P-A-G-E-111
  INSTRUCTORS AND INSTRUCTION 
scattering of other types accounts for the remaining 
instances of recognition. Interestingly enough the pro- 
portions of approved and unapproved colleges report- 
ing recognition differ hardly at all. 
Thus not only does the junior-college offering give 
promise of meeting the needs of the situation in pro- 
viding the first two years of work in colleges and uni- 
versities, not only have the new units made excellent 
progress toward achieving an adequate instructional 
situation, and not only do graduates of accredited 
junior colleges compare favorably in scholarship 
with those who have done their work in a standard 
university, but the new unit is well on its way to a 
recognition by universities and colleges of work done 
by its students.

THE JUNIOR COLLEGE IN ITS DEMOCRATIZING 
FUNCTION 
I. THE PROBLEMS 
Three at least of the claims often made on behalf of 
the junior college as reported in Chapter II have inti- 
mate meaning for its relationship to democratization 
of education on the level concerned. We refer to 
those special purposes which bear upon completing or 
“rounding out” the education of those who will not, 
cannot, or should not “go on”; to the provision of 
occupational training for semiprofessions; and to the 
popularization of higher education through lowering 
its cost and bringing it nearer the home of the student. 
Three major problems of the whole task of democ- 
ratizing education on the junior-college level will be 
canvassed in this chapter. (1) The first of these re- 
lates to the adaptation of work on this level to the 
rising tide of popular education which has brought and 
continues increasingly to bring into our higher institu- 
tions many students who, in contrast with those who 
met the requirements of the selective processes of a 
generation or two ago, are not as well qualified to con- 
[ z00 ]
-P-A-G-E-113
DEMOCRATIZATION 
tinue their education into the levels beyond the junior- 
college years. This is the problem of mental democra- 
tization of higher education. (2) The second concerns 
the provision of lines of semiprofessional training for 
those who cannot or should not go on. Properly to 
democratize education for those who do not continue, 
we must, if this is at all possible, afford opportunities 
for training for occupations lying somewhere in the 
region between the trade levels and the more strictly 
professional levels. (3) The third problem bears upon 
the likelihood of increasing, through the establishment 
of junior-college units near the homes of students, the 
proportion of the population who will receive the bene- 
fits of higher education. In no small part this may be 
regarded as the problem of economic democratization 
of higher education through the junior college. 
There is no intent to imply by separate treatment 
that these three problems have not intimate relation- 
ships each to the other. They are as much interin- 
volved as are the three conceptions of special purpose 
of the junior college which have given rise to the in- 
quiry into the possibilities of educational democratiza- 
tion by means of this new unit in the system. No 
special discussion is accorded these important inter- 
relationships, but some appreciation of them will be 
given the reader if he takes the pains to consider 
the way the three problems just named overlap one 
another.

II. THE Junior CoLLEGE AND MENTAL DEMocrATI- 
ZATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION 
A comparison of junior-college students with those 
enrolled in corresponding years of colleges and uni- 
versities. The expectation, sometimes expressed and 
sometimes implied, of many whose statements have 
been incorporated in the analysis of purposes to which 
reference has just been made, is that popularization 
of education on the junior-college level will and should 
be accompanied by a wider range of mentality than is 
now represented in these years of our colleges and 
universities. The recent development of what are 
called mental tests makes it possible (1) to ascertain 
the extent to which this expectation is being realized 
and also (2) to canvass (at least partly) the question 
of whether our higher institutions are disposed to at- 
tempt to cope with as much of this type of populariza- 
tion as has manifested itself without junior-college 
reorganization. Correspondingly this section will in- 
clude (1) a comparison by means of mental tests of 
students in junior colleges and students in the same 
years of other higher institutions and (2) a study of a 
group of students in one such higher institution as to 
the relation of their mental-test scores to degree of 
success and subjects pursued during residence. 
Distributions of scores in the army alpha test are 
not essentially different for junior colleges than for

state universities. On the other hand, there is a 
marked contrast of distributions and a wide difference 
between the medians when the former are compared 
with distributions for institutions like Oberlin and 
Yale. The contrast for Yale is even more striking 
than that for Oberlin. In attempting to account for 
the larger difference for Yale, it should be kept in mind

Significance for the junior-college movement. The 
most obvious point of significance in the comparisons 
thus afforded as to the mental character of junior- 
college students is that the authorities in higher insti- 
tutions, more especially our state universities, have 
little or no ground for the fear that the junior college

in its present state of development brings into their 
upper years a flood of mentally incompetent students. 
The data make clear that junior-college students are 
in this respect about on a par with students of the 
same classification in most colleges and universities.

DEMOCRATIZATION 
the student body, their regret being associated with 
the attenuation at the lower end of the distribution. 
After all, it is not especially to be wondered at that 
the junior colleges have not yet fully achieved the type 
of popularization here alluded to. The movement is 
still in its youth. Being so, its full scope of function 
is not yet clear in the minds of all those connected with 
the examples of the institution now in existence. As 
was noted in Chapter II the primary purpose as seen 
by all groups concerned was the isthmian one of pro- 
viding the first two years of work acceptable to col- 
leges and universities, much as the conception of the 
function of the public secondary school a generation 
or two ago was preparation for college. In the junior 
college the earlier problem has merely been raised to 
a higher level in our system of education. Anyone 
who converses much with those connected as adminis- 
trative heads or as teachers with these units, during 
the first few years of their existence, will soon become 
aware that “making good” with neighboring univer- 
sities is a matter of compelling concern. And this is 
doubtless as it should be during these earliest stages. 
This dominating conception of the chief function 
of the junior college during these early states of de- 
velopment is reflected in the scope of the work open to 
the prospective student, which, during the first years 
of the existence of a junior college, is not often more 
than colleges and universities prescribe during the 
[ 105 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-118
eee 
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
first two years of a four-year period of training. Many 
high-school graduates mentally on a par with those in 
the lower portions of the mental distributions in junior 
colleges referred to have unquestionably considered 
continuation in the local junior college, have weighed 
the possibilities of succeeding in branches with which 
they have already had discouraging experiences in the 
high school (for example, foreign languages, mathe- 
matics, and the sciences), and have come to the de- 
cision that junior-college work was not for them. The 
writer could cite instances also where those in charge 
of junior colleges take the attitude of discouragement 
toward those of this group who show signs of wanting 
to essay junior-college work, doubtless either keeping 
in mind the necessity of safeguarding success in per- 
forming the isthmian function or—which amounts to 
the same thing—prompted by the feeling that those 
only should go on who can make a success of college 
work as traditionally administered. 
Niewed from one significant standpoint the data 
referred to augur mental democratization of the level 
of work under consideration through the extension of 
the junior-college movement. This prophecy is to be 
found in the contrast of distributions in state universi- 
ties with those in institutions on private foundations, 
such as Oberlin and Yale. The distributions of mental- 
test scores show that the private institutions are not 
alone in having considerable proportions of students 
[ 106 ]
-P-A-G-E-119
  
DEMOCRATIZATION 
in the upper reaches of the army alpha test; the 
major difference is that the public institutions dip 
lower down. By not being responsible to a public 
constituency the strong private higher institution has 
been in a position to draw a higher selective line. 
Hitherto this has been regarded as the right of a pri- 
vate individual or a corporation. On the other hand, 
the two institutions on state foundations are in more 
than one sense in the position (not rank) of the mu- 
nicipal junior college. In the first place they serve 
public constituencies, which insist in more or less defi- 
nite ways on democratization, and in the second place 
they are both located in large centers of population 
which provide no small proportion of the student body. 
For instance 388, or 61.5 per cent of the first 631 
freshmen in alphabetical arrangement entering the 
College of Science, Literature, and the Arts of the Uni- 
versity of Minnesota in 1921, had their residence in 
the Twin Cities or in suburban communities near. 
It would be surprising, indeed, if there were not some 
among these who, if a mental measure were taken, 
would be found in the lower portions of the distribu- 
tion and who, on account of the proximity of oppor- 
tunities of higher education at low cost, are willing to 
essay this higher level of work when they would hesi- 
tate about doing so if they had to leave the home town 
to attend. This is perhaps even accentuated when 
the only academic passport for admission is a certifi- 
[ 107 ]  
-P-A-G-E-120
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
cate indicating graduation from an accredited high 
school with a total of sixteen units, only six being pre- 
scribed and these being four units of English and two 
of mathematics. With the difference in distributions 
between these two types of institutions noted we are 
warranted in anticipating an even greater extent of 
mental democratization in junior colleges. It is likely 
to come much more rapidly after the more democratic 
purposes of the institution crystallize out of our cur- 
rent inexperience and after work more suited to the 
capacities under consideration is made available. 
Relationship between army alpha scores and suc- 
cess in college work. An important consideration in 
any decision as to whether we are in need of an exten- 
sion of the junior-college movement for the sake of 
democratizing higher education is the degree of suc- 
cess of colleges and universities in providing oppor- 
tunities for collegiate education to students in the 
lower portions of the mental distributions. The giving 
of the army tests to large numbers of students in col- 
leges and universities after the termination of hos- 
tilities in the late war has afforded the occasion for 
making studies which inquire into the relationship 
between the scores on the test and the degree of suc- 
cess of students when measured by their length of 
stay in school, average marks received, etc. Portions 
of the conclusions from such a study are reported here, 
the group of students concerned being those who were 
[ 108 ]

freshmen in the College of Science, Literature, and the 
Arts of the University of Minnesota during the year 
1918-1919. The scores used were obtained by Pro- 
fessor Van Wagenen of that institution in January, 
1919. Among those taking the test were an unselected 
group of 463 freshmen in the college named, 192 of 
these being men and 271 being women. For various 
reasons which are not given here on account of limita- 
tions of space, the number of students concerned in 
the tabulations from which conclusions are drawn was 
344, of whom 123 were men and 221 were women. By 
a statistical procedure involving probable error dis- 
tances they were divided into three groups, to be 
designated here as the “low,” “middle,” and “high” 
groups, the division being determined by mental-test 
scores. The number of students in each group and 
the score range of the group for men, women, and 
both sexes are as follows: 
  
  
Men ‘Women Tora, 
Group

High. . . 9 | 159-194 || 3x | 1531-184 |] 4o | 1531-194             
  
1 Through error a single case of a score of 153 was misplaced in the high 
group; that is, five points above its proper location throughout the tabu- 
lations made. Except for this case the range of the high group of women 
is 158 to 184 and of the total high group 158 to 194. This displacement of 
a single case can have scarcely more than an inappreciable effect upon the 
findings to be presented.

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Since earlier studies have shown conclusively that 
there is a marked relationship between mental-test 
scores and length of stay in higher institutions,’ space 
will be spared by omitting presentation of such find- 
ings in the investigation reported here. Suffice it to 
say that much larger percentages of those in the low 
group were eliminated than in either of the other 
two groups. 
Facts concerning elimination constitute only a par- 
tial account of the situation. More appears when a 
study is made of the relation between the mental level 
of the student and the likelihood of his accumulating 
any large number of honor-points during a period of 
residence of a year or two. 
These honor-points are obtained in the University 
of Minnesota by receiving marks higher than D, which 
is the lowest passing grade. Each hour of credit for 
which a student receives a mark of C gives him 1 
honor-point ; each hour of credit with mark B, 2 honor- 
points; each with A, 3 honor-points. If he receives 
marks of C in all his work in a quarter during which 
he carries fifteen hours, he receives 15 honor-points; 
1For example, Colvin said: ‘The tendency to eliminate the less intelli- 
gent students is indicated when we inspect the record of the class of 1922 
(at Brown University). In this class 334 men took the Brown tests. Of 
these, 115 had left college by the end of their sophomore year. Of those 
leaving 14 per cent stood high in their psychological tests, 41 per cent re- 
ceived average scores, and 45 per cent low scores,”—S. S. Corvin, “The 
Use of Intelligence Tests,” in Educational Review, Vol. LXII, pp. 134-135 
(September, 1921) 
[ 110]
-P-A-G-E-123
  DEMOCRATIZATION 
if B, 30 honor-points; if A, 45 honor-points. No 
honor-points are assigned to marks lower than C. 
Advancement from the junior to the senior college in 
the College of Science, Literature, and the Arts is 
conditioned upon the student’s earning go credits and 
90 honor-points. In effect, then, to be advanced to 
the upper unit the student must receive an average 
mark of C (not merely a passing mark of D) in an 
average of 15 credits per quarter for six quarters. 
The findings of the present study make clear that 
the student in the low group has practically no chance 
of advancement to the upper unit in the colleges, as 
84.5 per cent of the men and 84.2 per cent of the 
women in this group received marks in all their work 
which placed their averages below the honor-point 
level. Moreover, this plan seems not to be suited to 
the needs of the great middle group constituting the 
bulk of the student body, since more than half— 
53.6 per cent—of these do not attain an average mark 
that brings honor-points with it. 
A further description of the honor-point situation 
is provided in another statistical approach, the com- 
putation of the percentages of each of the three groups 
who earned ten honor-points or less during each quar- 
ter of residence. The main findings of this approach 
lead to the same conclusion as those arising out of the 
proportions receiving average marks below the honor- 
point level: that the plan looks toward the selection 
[rrr]

of students of superior quality for work on the upper 
level, rather than toward training the student in terms 
of his capacity on the level in which he is enrolled.

elementary sort, or mathematics. The former was 
taken in greater or less amount by almost all those 
who dropped out—by 85 per cent of the total num- 
ber, in fact. Mathematics was taken by two thirds 
of the men, but by a smaller proportion of the women. 
The taking of work in both the subject-groups, espe- 
cially the particular courses pursued by the students 
under consideration, assumes subsequent work in the 
same or closely dependent lines. They are in effect, 
when taken by a student who does not proceed as is 
assumed, lower portions of a truncated curriculum, 
not the culminal portions of a shorter period of educa- 
tion better suited to the needs of those eliminated. 
This is remote from “rounding out” the education of 
students not going on. 
It is perhaps gratuitous to restate in this connection 
that there are among these eliminated students some 
whose army-test scores were in the middle and high 
groups as here classified. The proportions are, how- 
ever, much smaller than for the low group. Notwith- 
standing their superiority the inappositeness of the 
materials of a truncated curriculum is hardly less 
conspicuous. 
These facts would not have been presented were 
there any misgiving that they are not more or less 
representative of stronger colleges and universities 
generally. The sifting process may differ in detail, 
but elimination and discouragement of those in the

to our democratic assumptions, are entitled to it and 
can be expected to profit by it. It is not impossible 
to accomplish this in brief space, especially as the 
alpha test was first put in use by the United States 
army on large numbers of the draft in operation dur-

ing the late war. The means used is a comparison of 
the distribution of scores obtained by the 344 fresh- 
men used in the study just reported with that of 
51,620 men in the white draft, who are all those men 
from the 100,000 native-born “who took alpha only 
or alpha and beta only, alpha and an individual ex- 
amination or alpha, beta, and an individual examina- 
tion.”* In other words, all took the alpha test, and so 
we know that all were literate. The distribution does 
not adequately represent all the literate white native- 
born men of the nation, because many of the most in- 
telligent of those men had already entered the army 
as officers or as officer-candidates. This fact can de- 
tract little from the significance of the comparison. 
The two distributions display a striking contrast. 
They show that college students are drawn almost 
exclusively from the upper reaches of the total dis- 
tribution. Put in approximate numerical terms, the 
comparison shows that more than nine tenths of 
the college freshmen come from the upper fifth of the 
literate white native-born. On the other hand, less 
than a tenth come from all the remaining four fifths.

to say more—those in the total population who now 
have some representation in the college group have a

range of scores includes approximately a third of the 
army distribution. It should be noted, also, that all 
the individuals in this low group are well above the 
median score of the white draft, which is 58.9. 
The last contrast of figures is, of course, far from 
the same thing as stating that 16.9 per cent of all the 
[117]
-P-A-G-E-130
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
30 per cent, let us say, of our white literate population 
of appropriate ages are enjoying the opportunities 
of higher education to some extent. A dependable 
estimate along these lines would be difficult to make. 
But when it is remembered that few if any of the stu- 
dents of this range of mentality obtain entrance to 
some of our stronger institutions, and that in most of 
the others to which they are admitted they are soon 
discouraged by a sifting process well-nigh universal, 
educational opportunities for them—except as pro- 
vided in the high schools, which many of them have 
completed and in increasing proportions will complete 
—may be judged to be almost totally absent. In the 
face of the rising tide of education the present facili- 
ties for this type of student in standard colleges and 
universities strike one as distressingly ineffectual. 
The solution of the problem. In this situation 
neither the American ideal of democratic education 
nor the scholastic ideals of standard colleges and uni- 
versities seem likely soon to give way. It would re- 
quire some gigantic force now indiscernible to wrench 
from us our conviction that we must attain both men- 
tal and economic democratization of educational op- 
portunities to a much larger extent than now obtains. 
In consequence the tide is certain to continue to rise 
and the opportunities to reach down increasingly to 
the mental levels we have seen to be now relatively 
untouched. 
[ 118 ]
-P-A-G-E-131
  DEMOCRATIZATION 
On the other hand, the sifting process seems almost 
inherent in our present college and university system 
and is not without important considerations to recom- 
mend it. These institutions whose training is offered 
in periods of four or more years have it in their nature 
to administer requirements in terms of the full dura- 
tion of these periods, whether the requirements are 
of particular courses prescribed or of quantity and 
quality of work to be done. A host of their traditions 
have grown out of the contemplation of the comple- 
tion of a full four-year curriculum or more. Pressed 
with this flood of “inferior” candidates for higher edu- 
cation—many of whom, although deserving of some 
extent of opportunity beyond the present high-school 
level, are not warranted in aspiring to a full traditional 
college or university course—they have proceeded to 
protect the longer course by one or another process of 
selection. Many of the private and some of the public 
institutions have set up barriers at entrance; for ex- 
ample, the plan of accepting only candidates whose 
high-school averages place them in the upper two 
thirds of their classes, the requirement of passing a 
rigid entrance examination, or the prescription for 
admission of large numbers of units in subjects of 
high selective value, such as ancient languages and 
mathematics. 
These have often been justified by the absence of 
facilities for taking care of larger numbers of students. 
[119 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-132
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Other institutions, more of them subject to public than 
to private control, not being in a position to bar such 
students at entrance, have set up more or less elabo- 
rate but effective devices of sifting to which the 
students are subjected after entrance. Still other in- 
stitutions operate two types of selection, one prior to 
admission, the other subsequent to it. 
Viewed from this standpoint of success in curricula 
four or more years in length, these plans of exclusion 
and selection are not open to unqualified condemna- 
tion. It is when attention centers round the broader 
service which must be rendered those who are now 
being excluded or abused after they have been ad- 
mitted that the unendurableness of such plans be- 
comes conspicuous. However, their universality and 
their compatibility with long-course traditions assure 
us that they are almost as unlikely soon to disappear 
as is our general acceptance of the concept of a demo- 
cratic higher education. In consequence, without re- 
organization it must be long indeed before mental 
democratization can be achieved. The hope must rest 
not in readjustments within colleges and universities 
of the current type, but in institutions in which the 
first two college years under consideration are terminal 
grades. That is to say, it rests in the utilization of 
the junior-college idea. Our assurance that the inter- 
ests of those who will not or should not go beyond the 
first and second college years will be better conserved 
: [120]
-P-A-G-E-133
  DEMOCRATIZATION 
in such an institution is grounded in the fact that 
the lower schools with which this work should be 
associated have already made propitious beginnings 
toward differentiating work for those who can and 
should continue their education and for those who 
cannot or should not continue it. 
III. THE Junior CoLLEGE AND TRAINING FOR 
SEMIPROFESSIONS 
The problem and the method of mquiry. As has 
been noted, one of the aspirations designated as a 
special purpose of the new unit is the provision of 
occupational training of junior-college grade, this 
aspiration being entertained by approximately half of 
all the sources examined in the search for the claims 
made for the junior college. 
The authors of the statements analyzed have in 
mind here preparation for occupations the training 
for which is to be concluded during the junior-college 
period, and which are, from the standpoint of the 
period of training involved, semiprofessions. Such 
occupations are to be distinguished on the one hand 
from trades, the training for which is concluded during 
the conventional secondary-school period, and on the 
other from professions, adequate preparation for 
which requires four or more years of training beyond 
the high school. 
[ 121 ]
-P-A-G-E-134
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Those who advocate culminal occupational training 
on this level make mention of large groups like com- 
merce, industry, agriculture, and home economics. 
They seldom, however, specify particular occupations. 
In fact, although frequent brief references to the prob- 
lem are to be found in literature dealing with occupa- 
tional training, one looks in vain for anything like an 
adequate treatment. With all the other aspects of the 
junior-college problem into which it was necessary to 
inquire in this investigation, it was manifestly impos- 
sible to include a comprehensive study of this particu- 
lar aspect. Moreover, our present want of experience 
with semiprofessions must prevent our arriving at 
anything like finalities, except in the matter of the 
desirability and feasibility of development along 
these lines. 
The study of this aspect of the junior-college prob- 
lem followed two main directions: (1) The first was 
a canvass of present educational facilities to note any 
outcroppings of opportunities for semiprofessional 
training. This phase of the inquiry included examina- 
tion of current junior-college offerings, two-year 
curricula in other higher institutions, courses for high- 
school graduates in business colleges, extension de- 
partments in universities, a group of miscellaneous 
institutions advertising training along a wide variety 
of lines, and private correspondence schools. (2) The 
second was that of ascertaining the opinions of a large 
[ 122 ]
-P-A-G-E-135
    
DEMOCRATIZATION 
number of deans (and heads of departments) of engi- 
neering, commerce, and agriculture as to the proper 
level of terminal training for a number of occupations 
in or related to their special fields. Mention of minor 
supplementary inquiries is deferred to the points at 
which they are presented. 
1. That some junior colleges include occupational 
materials in their offerings was made apparent in 
Chapter III. The proportion of the total offering as- 
signed to such courses in junior colleges was there 
seen to be much larger than in the junior-college years 
of separate colleges of liberal arts or of colleges con- 
nected with universities. An examination of the distri- 
bution of original courses from which this conclusion 
is drawn would show that some of them will be of 
service to the student with professional ambitions, 
others to the student desirous of securing some extent 
of occupational training on the semiprofessional level, 
and still others will be useful to either type of student. 
The writer’s examination of catalogues of junior 
colleges and his conversations with junior-college 
heads and instructors lead him to believe that without 
doubt offerings of the sort referred to have in some 
instances been introduced for the primary purpose of 
providing terminal occupational training on this level. 
On the other hand, this intent is not as general as may 
be desired, a majority of the institutions seeming to 
have an eye single to meeting the demands of higher 
[ 123 ] 
   
-P-A-G-E-136
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
institutions to which junior-college graduates will be 
likely to transfer, an attitude not altogether unreason- 
able in the earliest stages of development of an educa- 
tional institution. 
Among the instances of obvious intent to provide in 
junior colleges culminal occupational training the fol- 
lowing may be cited. One of the best examples in 
agriculture is that of Chaffey Junior College at On- 
tario, California. In this institution courses valuable 
both for culminal and preprofessional purposes are 
offered. The unit maintained in the State Normal 
School at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, features a curriculum 
“organized to meet the needs of students who desire to 
become technical chemists after two years of study.” 
A number of students who have completed this work 
and who did not continue their education are em- 
ployed in lines for which the curriculum was intended 
to prepare them. A state junior college in the South 
offers an automobile-mechanics curriculum terminat- 
ing in the second college year, but at the time of the 
writer’s visit only a few high-school graduates were 
enrolled in it. Those who were taking the special work 
of the curriculum were for the most part not high- 
school graduates. While undoubtedly valuable occu- 
pational training was being given, the students were 
not receiving it as semiprofessional preparation in the 
sense in which this term is here used. In much the 
same situation is a curriculum in oil-production offered 
[124]
-P-A-G-E-137
    DEMOCRATIZATION 
in a junior college of Southern California. There is in 
operation in connection with the Riverside, California, 
Junior College a half-time codperative plan of semi- 
professional training along industrial and commercial 
lines that gives promise of great usefulness. In con- 
junction with the junior colleges at Kansas City, Mis- 
souri, and Grand Rapids, Michigan, are given the 
theoretical portions of the curriculum for nurses in 
training. In the same units is provided work along 
secretarial and other commercial lines that may be 
looked upon as in the nature of semiprofessional train- 
ing. Here also should be included some of the work 
in home economics available in a number of junior 
colleges, public and private. 
The relatively large amount of work in the field of 
education available in junior colleges, especially in 
private units, is in harmony with what is in essence by 
far the most prevalent semiprofessional training func- 
tion of the junior colleges—preparation for teaching. 
This is especially characteristic of private junior col- 
leges in Missouri and the Southern states, but is also 
to be found elsewhere to some extent. It is the claim 
to the performance of this function exclusively which 
makes the catalogues of private junior colleges yield 
as large a proportionate recognition of the claim un- 
der consideration as the other types of literature ex- 
amined, as stated in Chapter II. As illustrations we 
may quote a statement typical of the catalogues of 
[125 ]
-P-A-G-E-138
    THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
junior colleges in Missouri, that “the State Depart- 
ment of Education will grant to all graduates of the 
college who have completed the prescribed courses 
in education a three years’ state certificate permitting 
the holder to teach in the public schools of towns and 
cities of Missouri”; and another, characteristic of 
those in Texas, that classification “by the State De- 
partment of Education as a Junior College of first 
class . . . signifies that the student completing five 
courses in our first college year, one of which is 
Education, will be granted a first-grade state certifi- 
cate for four years without examination.” Although 
elementary-school teaching (into which most of the 
holders of these certificates go) is, from the standpoint 
of the period of training typical of its participants, 
still a semiprofession, it may well be asked whether it 
should remain so, or, if it must, whether one or two 
years of regular collegiate work is the proper sort of 
training for it. State normal schools should be in a 
position to give better training for elementary-school 
teaching than are institutions stressing the first two 
years of work in colleges of liberal arts. The only 
excuse for approving the practice is the dearth of 
teachers with anything like adequate preparation for 
the work. Certainly, for high-school teaching, into 
which a considerable proportion of junior-college stu- 
dents go upon graduation, the semiprofessional level 
is far too low. 
[ 126 ]
-P-A-G-E-139
  
  DEMOCRATIZATION 
The offerings described seem at least to be the begin- 
nings of a constructive tendency toward endeavoring 
to provide something in the way of semiprofessional 
training for those who are not going on. Although 
they are totally absent from most units and not always 
wide in scope where offered, we have in these begin- 
nings an earnest of generous future development, espe- 
cially in view of the recency of the junior-college 
movement. 
A letter of inquiry was sent to deans or directors of 
all colleges of engineering and agriculture with the 
request that they should give information concerning 
all two-year curricula offered in their institutions, stat- 
ing the character of. any such curricula as collegiate 
or noncollegiate and also stating the enrollment in 
each during 1920-1921. To the one hundred and 
twenty-eight letters sent to heads of standard engi- 
neering colleges, as listed in the educational directory 
issued by the Bureau of Education, one hundred and 
three replies were received. Of that number six in- 
stitutions reported one-year, two-year, or three-year 
curricula of college grade in engineering or allied in- 
dustrial activities. The numbers of students enrolled 
were stated by only one institution. The dean of 
another college of engineering said of the two-year 
curriculum in highway engineering, “We have had a 
number of men enroll for this course, but in every 
instance they have remained and completed the full 
[127] 
 
-P-A-G-E-140
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
course required for the degree of C.E.” The dean in 
still another college said of their two-year technical 
curricula that there are usually only two or three stu- 
dents each year in them, that the men generally find 
they want the four-year curriculum, and that they are 
enabled to transfer without much loss of time. 
In agriculture forty-seven letters were sent out, and 
forty replies were received. Six institutions reported 
that they were giving two-year collegiate curricula. 
Examination of catalogue descriptions showed, as 
might be expected, that the foundational work in 
sciences and cultural subjects given with the four-year 
curriculum was pared down or condensed and that 
most of the student’s time was given to the applied 
subjects. 
From the results of this inquiry we must conclude 
that our professional schools tend to hold rather 
closely to their professional standards, and that they 
are doing little in a direct way to train people for 
occupations on the semiprofessional level. The usual 
small enrollments in the shorter curricula, and the 
tendency of students to shift to the longer fully pro- 
fessional offerings, are not likely to influence the 
authorities in such institutions to introduce more of 
the shorter. At the same time it may be seriously 
doubted if, with the stigma which attaches to attend- 
ance upon a shorter curriculum where the longer is 
the more honorific, these semiprofessional curricula in 
[ 128 ]
-P-A-G-E-141
  
  DEMOCRATIZATION 
standard professional schools can ever make much 
headway in colleges and universities. 
2. A third source examined were the bulletins 
of twenty-eight extension divisions of universities, 
twenty-one being state institutions and the remainder 
municipal and private institutions. It was found that 
the extension work of about twelve state institutions 
and two private institutions is largely or entirely 
straight liberal-arts-college material, and it may safely 
be said of the majority of the twenty-eight that the 
work is planned primarily for people who will eventu- 
ally be graduated from one of the university colleges 
and enter a profession, as contrasted with a semi- 
profession. This situation is not difficult to explain. 
The easiest courses to offer in extension classes or by 
correspondence are those already planned and taught 
in the university proper; and the university aims to 
give professional training. 
Constituting exceptions to the conclusion that exten- 
sion divisions are not concerned with semiprofessions 
are the following items: Three university-extension 
departments have definitely outlined curricula in the 
field of business requiring two or three years to com- 
plete through evening courses only. Practice varies as 
to allowing regular university credit for these courses, 
some of which are accounting, money and banking, 
commercial law, corporation finance, real estate, in- 
surance, etc. One of the three institutions offers 
[ 129 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-142
ee eee nee 
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
evening curricula three years in length in architec- 
ture and in civil, electrical, and mechanical engineer- 
ing. Still another institution, a state university, offers 
a large number of courses in business and engineer- 
ing, for a majority of which credit toward regular 
university degrees is not given. Though not arranged 
in definite curricula, the nature of the courses seems to 
be somewhat along the line of a recognition of semi- 
professional occupations. 
3. The study of business colleges was made from 
the catalogues of twenty-two representative schools. 
Seventeen of these are giving only courses to fit people 
for clerical work, such as bookkeeping, stenography, 
typing, which is clearly on no higher level than the 
work done by the commercial departments of our 
high schools. The other five institutions are giving 
the same sort of training, but, in addition, offer a few 
courses only for high-school graduates who have had 
an ordinary business-college course or a secondary- 
school business course. These courses are in higher 
accounting and secretarial service. One secretarial 
course is advertised as being from four to eight months 
in length, another from six to eight months in length. 
From this we must conclude that they are too shallow 
to turn out a secretary who is many notches above a 
stenographer. It is also doubtful if the courses in 
accounting could turn out an accountant very superior 
to a bookkeeper, although there is nothing definite in 
[ 130 ]
-P-A-G-E-143
  
DEMOCRATIZATION 
the description of the course upon which such an 
opinion could be based. To sum up, it may be said 
that the business colleges have assumed that their 
most important function is to train people for clerical 
occupations, but they are doing a little along semi- 
professional lines. 
4. Another group of schools, designated as miscel- 
laneous, were listed in the United States Bureau of 
Education directory* as institutions of higher rank 
than secondary schools, but not regarded as universi- 
ties, colleges, or normal schools. All were approached 
for publications descriptive of the work offered, and 
these came in from a total of twenty-nine institutions, 
three of them supported publicly and twenty-six 
privately. There are five schools or departments of 
schools giving training for engineering and allied ac- 
tivities, seven for business activities, five for home 
economics, and twenty-two for art, music, expression, 
and special training. All these schools are giving train- 
ing on what may be presumed to be (at least approxi- 
mately) the semiprofessional level, and all but a 
few confine their activities to one of the four fields 
mentioned. 
Schools of the engineering type offer two-year and 
three-year curricula above the high school. Some idea 
of their scope may be had by noting the names of 
curricula in one school: industrial mechanical, in- 
1United States Bureau of Education Bulletin No. 33 (1920), pp. 14-44. 
[131] 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
    THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
dustrial electrical, industrial chemistry, industrial 
teacher-training, electrical construction, and architec- 
tural drawing and design. The business schools, while 
conducting some work on the semiprofessional level, 
also give courses clearly clerical in nature. Most of 
the five schools specializing in home economics offer 
two-year curricula calculated to fit students to be 
dietitians, costume designers, institution managers, 
home-makers, and teachers of home economics. 
By far the largest division of this group is made up 
of schools of art, music, and expression, of which only 
two are publicly supported. The catalogues of this 
group stress the cultural as well as the occupational 
aspects of the work they offer. 
5. The last group of catalogue studies were those 
of privately operated correspondence schools. Only a 
small group of seven schools advertising rather exten- 
sively were requested to send materials descriptive of 
their offerings. Some of them list courses covering a 
wide range including elementary, secondary, and uni- 
versity work, and accordingly they have no stand- 
ards for admission. Although comparison of a school’s 
courses with those of another such school, or with those 
of a high school or a university, is possible only in a 
vague way, the attempt was made to take account of 
work of a professional or semiprofessional nature. 
The main divisions into which these courses fall 
relate to engineering and allied activities and busi- 
[ 132 ]
-P-A-G-E-145
  DEMOCRATIZATION 
ness, with two schools giving just a little attention to 
commercial illustration and design. Some idea of the 
magnitude of the work that these schools do, or that 
they claim to do, is conveyed by a survey of the cata- 
logue of one of the largest, which shows the field of 
engineering and allied activities to be separated into 
twenty-one divisions, in each of which there is offered 
an average of eighteen courses. The work of a school 
stressing business courses covers the following range: 
business administration, higher accounting, law 
(toward the degree of LL.B., and also commercial 
law for business men), interstate commerce and rail- 
way traffic, banking and finance, business letter- 
writing, industrial-management efficiency, commercial 
Spanish, and coaching for certified public accountant. 
This examination of the offerings of somewhat 
more than three hundred institutions or organizations 
for evidences of training of semiprofessional sorts, 
although not discovering a full array of systematized 
and standardized curricula, shows at least an appre- 
ciable beginning and a partial awareness of the large 
need represented. An occasional junior college has 
sensed this need and is providing preparation along 
semiprofessional lines. Recognition of the function 
concerned has in a small proportion of instances found 
its way as two-year or three-year curricula into the 
offerings of colleges of engineering and agriculture. 
Registration in these curricula has not usually been 
[133 ]
-P-A-G-E-146
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
large and is not likely to become so on account of the 
presence of dominating curricula of standard length. 
University-extension divisions in several instances, 
through establishing courses and curricula of an occu- 
pational sort on this level, seem to be increasingly 
appreciative of the value of this type of service. Busi- 
ness colleges, although engrossed primarily with the 
task of preparing for occupations on the clerical level, 
have in a few instances taken steps in this direction 
through making special provision for high-school grad- 
uates. The educational offerings of groups of miscel- 
laneous institutions and correspondence schools also 
contain evidences of a corroboratory character. 
If the outcroppings discovered are any indication, 
proper lines of development of semiprofessions and 
semiprofessional training are the fields of business, 
engineering and allied activities, applied arts, agri- 
culture, and home economics. Despite the difficul- 
ties of establishing lines of distinction between trades 
on the one hand and semiprofessions on the other, 
and again between semiprofessions and professions, 
we seem to have in these evidences some support of 
a belief that there are and should be occupations 
on the intermediate level, and that they should be 
legitimized by the provisions of ample standardized 
curricula in preparation for them. That most of the 
outcroppings are found in connection with the less 
formal agencies of education should not be regarded 
[134]
-P-A-G-E-147
  DEMOCRATIZATION 
as discrediting the necessity for the development, 
inasmuch as many educational innovations of merit 
have first made a place for themselves in a supple- 
mentary and external capacity, later to be incorpo- 
rated as regular features of our school system. 
Expert opinion on semiprofessions. For the pur- 
pose of determining specifically what occupations 
might be classified as semiprofessions on the basis 
of the amount of education and other preparation re- 
quired, a list was made of all occupations for which 
in the opinion of some authority preparation should 
be made in a course of training approximately two 
years in length, with a high-school education or its 
equivalent as a prerequisite. An examination of the 
list showed that there were, in addition to many 
important and unimportant occupations in widely 
scattered fields, three main classes; namely, com- 
merce, engineering, and agriculture. To secure a 
collective opinion of the training levels in which 
occupations in these three main fields were located, 
check sheets were sent to deans or directors of schools 
in the three fields represented, the number of check 
sheets returned being approximately one hundred 
and fifty. The method of the inquiry was to request 
those whose expert opinion was sought to indicate 
each of the occupations listed as trade or clerical 
(occupations “in order to enter upon which one 
should be trained in a high school, trade school, 
[135 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-148
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
commercial school, or other institution which pre- 
supposes a knowledge of the common-school subjects 
and gives education on a level of less than college 
grade”), semiprofessional (occupations “in order to 
enter upon which one should prepare himself with a 
course of training approximately two years in length 
with a high-school education or its equivalent as a 
prerequisite”), and professional (occupations “for 
which the training should be that given by an in- 
stitution requiring for entrance at least graduation 
from an accredited secondary school and offering a 
course of college grade no less than four years in 
length and culminating in an appropriate and rec- 
ognized degree’’). 
Many of those who codperated wrote letters ex- 
pressing belief in the fundamental importance of such 
a study and volunteering comments on the difficul- 
ties they had found in thus classifying occupations. 
Space can be spared for only the briefest treat- 
ment of the results of the balloting by the experts. 
Fifty per cent or more of the deans of colleges 
and heads of departments of commerce agreed that 
fourteen of the fifty-seven occupations in the list 
submitted are appropriately semiprofessions, these 
occupations being commercial, loan and stock brokers, 
city department-store buyers, chief clerks, credit 
men, commercial designers, insurance agents and ad- 
justers, jobbing and wholesale merchants, statistical 
[ 136 ]  
-P-A-G-E-149
  DEMOCRATIZATION 
clerks, and shipping-department heads and store- 
keepers with large concerns. A third to a half placed 
in this list of semiprofessions twenty-one more of the 
list, among them merchants, agents, and salesmen 
of various sorts, private secretaries, general account- 
ants, and traffic managers. The remaining twenty- 
two occupations were placed, by a majority of those 
venturing opinions, either among the professions or 
the clerical positions, by far the largest number (nine- 
teen, to be exact) being classified with the former. 
Among these are cost and certified public account- 
ants, auditors, comptrollers, credit managers, employ- 
ment managers, sales managers, and general managers, 
bond salesmen, and statisticians. 
Among the engineering and related occupations 
which were placed in the list of semiprofessions by 
a half or more of the deans of colleges of engineer- 
ing are cement testers, chemical-laboratory workers, 
general contractors in building-trades, draftsmen of 
various sorts (for example, mechanical, structural, 
architectural, sheet-metal, topographical, etc.), elec- 
tricians, inspectors, superintendents, and surveyors. 
The full number includes forty-three of a total list 
of one hundred and four occupations submitted for 
judgment. To them would be added, if a third to 
a half of the deans had their way, twenty-two more 
occupations, leaving but thirty-nine in the strictly 
professional and trade lists, all but ten of these 
[137] 
   
-P-A-G-E-150
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
being very commonly designated by these officers as 
unquestioned professions. 
The results of balloting by deans of colleges of 
agriculture (including forestry) are in harmony with 
those of the two preceding groups of experts. Just a 
fourth of the forty-eight occupations in the list sub- 
mitted to this group are looked upon as semiprofes- 
sions by a half or more of the deans consulted, among 
these occupations being those of florists, foremen on 
truck farms, managers of butter and cheese factories, 
makers of butter, cheese, or ice cream, testers for 
cow-test associations, poultrymen, lumber salesmen, 
forest rangers, woods superintendents, etc. A group 
of twenty-five are placed among the semiprofessions 
by a third to a half of the deans, leaving only eleven 
of the original list in the professions and trades. 
If the results of the balloting may be assumed to 
have anything of determinative value—and it may 
be questioned whether more competent groups of 
judges can be found than these leaders in their 
respective fields of training—we have undoubted 
evidence of the desirability of providing training for 
semiprofessions, and that, too, for a large number 
of them. 
A special request was also made that the deans 
and department heads should specify in the lists of 
occupations any that have been indicated as appro- 
priately semiprofessions for which their institutions 
[ 138 ]
-P-A-G-E-151
    
DEMOCRATIZATION 
gave “essential preparation by approximately two 
years’ training.” Returns to this request show that 
a considerable proportion of these officers have con- 
fidence that the present content of courses offered 
in their schools is suited to the needs of some of 
these semiprofessional occupations. While this type 
of information will help to answer the question 
whether the necessary content is at hand, it has little 
pertinence for the question whether as traditionally 
administered it can serve the purpose under con- 
sideration. Further light would be thrown on this 
question by the facts concerning the proportion of 
special occupational work prescribed during the first 
two years of professional curricula as presented in 
Chapter III. The relatively small proportions of 
such work in many lines and institutions means that if 
the student endeavored to secure the requisite prep- 
aration for a semiprofession (assuming that he had 
decided on his occupational goal and knew the rela- 
tion of the courses to its attainment), he would need 
to get administrative approval for his deviation from 
regular curricular channels. Add to this the student’s 
almost certain distaste for entering upon an irregu- 
lar and shortened program in an institution which 
in its nature emphasizes curricula at least four years 
in length, and you have a situation which affords little 
or no hope of doing much toward training for these 
semiprofessions in standard colleges and universities. 
[139 ]
-P-A-G-E-152
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
On the other hand these opinions indicate that at 
least some of the materials in the first two years of 
professional and preprofessional curricula are perti- 
nent for semiprofessional training. Certain other 
materials now typically in more advanced years 
could, through abbreviation and partial simplifica- 
tion, be lowered to the under-classman level and, if 
introduced as culminal training in junior colleges, 
would serve to train for occupations on this inter- 
mediate level. If strong junior-college units offer 
these special occupational materials of the early pro- 
fessional or the preprofessional years, and the short- 
ened and depressed courses referred to, there is little 
occasion for doubting that most essential semipro- 
fessional training will be afforded, and with proper 
guidance both the individual student and society will 
thereby be more effectively served. 
Other possible lines for semiprofessions. The can- 
vass referred to in an earlier portion of this section 
found some justification for regarding certain addi- 
tional occupations as future semiprofessions. Since 
those in any single line were few in number it was 
not practicable to secure a composite picture of ex- 
pert opinion, as was done in commerce, engineering, 
and agriculture. Here might be placed managers of 
commercial, institutional, and industrial cafeterias, 
and dietitians; professional shoppers; designers, 
cutters, and painters in art-glass works; decorative 
[ 140 ]
-P-A-G-E-153
  
DEMOCRATIZATION 
modelers ; costume, commercial, jewelry, and stage de- 
signers; jewelry engravers; lithographic and photo 
engravers; commercial and interior decorators; vet- 
erinarians; masseurs, nurses, pharmacists, welfare 
supervisors, etc. 
Since courses in home economics of a more or less 
terminal character are often proposed for junior- 
college years, a word should be said concerning them 
and the desirability of regarding home-making as a 
semiprofession. Without doubt this occupation, for 
which most women are destined, is one of those for 
which training on the strictly professional level as 
here defined is none too much. In this sense, as well 
as in the sense also which admits that the period of 
training involved is only one element (though an im- 
portant one) in raising one’s life work to a level where 
it is professionally conceived and accomplished, home- 
making may be made as much of a profession as any 
that can be named. From the standpoint, however, of 
the most extended period of training which is prac- 
ticable for many, it is desirable to administer courses 
in this field for a large proportion of young women 
on the assumption that this occupation is to be for 
them a semiprofession ; that is, to give these courses 
as culminal training in junior-college years. Fortu- 
nately this is one of the fields in which junior colleges 
have already made a good beginning. But the impor- 
tance of the field justifies much greater recognition. 
[141 ]
-P-A-G-E-154
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
This may be achieved in a manner much like that sug- 
gested for the three fields more extensively dealt with 
in this section (namely, commerce, engineering and 
allied activities, and agriculture), which is to utilize 
all that is valuable as culminal training of those pro- 
fessional and preprofessional materials which com- 
monly find a place in the first two years above the high 
school, and to depress and abbreviate certain of the 
courses more frequently finding place in the upper 
years of four-year curricula. 
The major inferences from this study of semi- 
professions. The first large portion of the current 
section discloses outcroppings of provisions for train- 
ing on the semiprofessional level. These provisions, 
although relatively infrequent and predominantly 
afforded as supplementary and external agencies of 
education, are sufficiently extensive to assure us of a 
need not adequately met by the more formal agencies. 
It is significant that a consciousness of this need should 
be expressed by actual offerings of a semiprofessional 
sort even in these early stages of junior-college de- 
velopment while most junior colleges are directing 
efforts primarily at doing effectively the first two years 
of college and university work. The second large por- 
tion gives substantial corroboration to the major find- 
ing of the first and indicates more specifically some of 
the lines of occupational service for which training on 
the semiprofessional level should and can be given. 
[ 142 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  
  DEMOCRATIZATION 
The implications of the evidence do not seem to 
support the early and vigorous development of oppor- 
tunities for semiprofessional training in standard four- 
year colleges and universities. While institutions 
affording professional education have been in exist- 
ence for a long period, few made efforts of the sort 
here being considered. It seems to be in the nature 
of institutions with curricula four or more years in 
length to have in mind exclusively those who contem- 
plate completion of the full range of work provided. 
Moreover, even if faculties in charge of these standard 
colleges could as a whole be brought to see the desir- 
ability of offering semiprofessional curricula, it may be 
doubted whether students could be induced to enroll 
in them. To students there would always be some- 
thing in the nature of a stigma attached to aspiring to 
less than the highest available in an institution. 
The logical place for the development of semipro- 
fessional curricula seems to be the educational unit 
where the years in which the training is to be given 
are terminal years. This is the junior college. The 
authorities in charge will be more disposed to regard 
as a legitimate rdle of the new unit the provision of 
curricula concluding with the years of training for 
which they are responsible. To the student there will 
be less of what may seem a surrender of caste to enter 
upon a curriculum of an occupational sort if this 
terminates at the same point as those of other students 
[ 143 ]  
-P-A-G-E-156
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
who plan to transfer to higher institutions. Although 
something still remains to be done in high schools to 
elevate the commercial and other vocational curricula 
to the same honorific status in the mind of the student 
as that enjoyed by the college preparatory curriculum, 
there has in recent years been much improvement in 
this regard. By analogy we are justified in anticipat- 
ing a similar growth in esteem of semiprofessional 
curricula, a growth much more rapid than in the pro- 
fessional schools with curricula four or more years in 
length. 
Providing this training for semiprofessions in junior 
colleges has the support also of the most significant 
considerations drawn from the materials presented in 
the preceding section of this chapter and in its conclud- 
ing section, which deal respectively with the problems 
of mental and economic democratization through the 
establishment of this new unit. Culminal occupational 
training in these years will comport well with the 
needs of those who, because of moderate mental equip- 
ment or because of financial limitations, or for other 
reasons, should not or cannot continue their training 
on the higher level. 
There are many unsolved problems in this field of 
semiprofessional training ; for example, as to the lines 
of training which will be found feasible in junior col- 
leges generally or in particular communities, the secur- 
ing of suitable teachers, the financial responsibilities 
[ 144 ]
-P-A-G-E-157
DEMOCRATIZATION 
involved, etc. These will tend to retard development 
along right lines even in junior colleges ; but the needs 
of individuals for the training under consideration and 
of society for the types of services to be rendered by 
those receiving it may be accepted as an earnest of the 
enduring merit of the proposal, as well as of the ulti- 
mate place of the opportunities for semiprofessional 
training in the junior college. 
IV. Tue Junior CoLLecE AND Economic 
DEMOCRATIZATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION 
How the claim was scrutinized. Notwithstanding 
the strong presumption in favor of the claim that 
establishing junior colleges will, through the influence 
of lowered costs and sheer proximity of opportunities 
for the first two years of curricula of higher schools, 
popularize higher education, it is desirable to scru- 
tinize the claim in order (1) the more certainly to 
establish or to disestablish it, (2) to note the degree of 
its validity, (3) to evaluate the two most common 
types of junior colleges on this basis, and (4) to lay 
a partial basis for policies to be pursued in junior- 
college development of the future. 
The lines of inquiry upon which report is to be 
made in this concluding section of the chapter are 
(1) the parents’ justification of the movement, in or- 
der to see what consideration in support of the junior 
[145 ]  
-P-A-G-E-158
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
college looms most prominently in their minds, (2) the 
proportion to which students living at home while in 
attendance acknowledge themselves able to attend 
elsewhere, (3) the annual cost of attendance in the 
several types of higher institution both for students 
living at home and for those living away from home, 
(4) the extent of popularization through propinquity 
of opportunities for higher education, and (5) the 
occupational distribution of fathers of students in 
secondary and higher institutions, including junior 
colleges. 
Parents’ justification of the movement. One body 
of material assembled for the investigation of the 
junior-college movement which has some relevancy to 
the problem in hand came from parents of junior- 
college students in response to a question put to them. 
The question was simply why the son or daughter con- 
cerned was attending the local junior college rather 
than a college or university elsewhere. A total of 199 
blanks on which this question was printed were re- 
turned answered to the writer, coming from parents 
of students in four junior colleges in Minnesota, one 
in Michigan, one in Texas, and three in California. 
On these responses were given in all 423 reasons. 
An analysis of the reasons finds four given with 
much greater frequency than others. Two of these— 
home influences extended and more attention to the 
individual student—have no relevancy to the imme- 
[ 146 ]

diate problem and further reference to them will be 
deferred to the next chapter. 
The reason offered more frequently than any other, 
attendance at junior college less expensive, may be 
judged to have intimate meaning for the problem of

economic democratization of higher education. It was 
given in a total of 143 of the responses, which is more 
than a third of all the 423 reasons given and means 
that it appeared in almost three fourths of all the 199 
responses made. A large proportion—a fourth of all 
answering the question—whose answers were grouped

under this head state frankly that they “cannot af- 
ford” to send a son or daughter elsewhere. The pro- 
portion would doubtless have been even greater if 
all those who meant this when they reported “less 
expensive” had said so. 
In so far as parents referred to the equality of in- 
struction in junior colleges with instruction elsewhere 
—which was their almost universal practice in the 
remaining responses—some additional reason is im- 
plied. This surely must in some instances involve 
the most common reason given, attendance in junior 
college less expensive, although it must also involve 
others. 
Ability to go elsewhere of students living at home 
while in attendance. One source of the information 
assembled for this volume was a blank filled out by 
the students themselves. Many of the data supplied 
constitute the basis of subsequent portions of this sec- 
tion. A question which only students who were living 
at home were asked to answer was, Could you go to 
college if you had to live away from home while in at- 
tendance? This question was put to students in pub- 
lic junior colleges, private junior colleges, institutions 
of the separate-college type, and a state university. 
A total of 1016 students living at home answered 
the question by responses equivalent to “Yes,” “No,” 
or “Doubtful.” For practical purposes the “noes” 
and “‘doubtfuls” may be considered as a single group. 
[ 148 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
    
DEMOCRATIZATION 
These include 364, or 35.8 per cent, of all students 
responding. The percentages for all three groups— 
that is, public junior colleges, private junior colleges, 
and other higher institutions—run high, none drop- 
ping below a third of those answering the question. 
There can be no doubt that the chief deterrent fac- 
tor to attendance elsewhere for these students, if no 
collegiate opportunities were at hand, would be the 
financial outlay involved. Only occasionally could 
it be some other influence not directly traceable to 
economic considerations. 
Annual cost of attendance. Information concern- 
ing the cost of attendance was secured from the stu- 
dents themselves on the blanks referred to in the 
foregoing section. They were requested to report for 
a full school year on each item listed ; namely, board, 
room, tuition and fees, textbooks and school supplies, 
laundry, traveling expenses to and from school, and 
incidentals. An estimate of the total annual cost was 
also asked for. A first point of inquiry, the answers 
to which were used throughout the comparisons to 
follow, was, Do you live at home while attending ? 
Estimates were provided by more than 2000 stu- 
dents—g57 in sixteen public junior colleges, 729 in 
eight private junior colleges, and 348 in three Mid- 
Western colleges and a state university. Median costs 
on each item have been computed. Two sets of me- 
dian totals were also obtained, one emanating from 
[ 149 ]
-P-A-G-E-162
    THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
the estimated totals of the students themselves, the 
other from the sums of the respective medians for each 
of the items. Of the two totals the second probably 
supplied a better estimate of the cost of the bare 
essentials of a year of college work, although some 
merit must attach to the first, since the students prob- 
ably have in mind other items of cost than those listed 
to account for the differences between the two sets 
of totals. 
1. One notable tendency to difference in the meas- 
ures of totals is naturally that between the costs for 
students living at home and those living away from 
home while in attendance. For public junior colleges 
the difference between the medians of the first totals 
is that between $126 and $400; for private junior 
colleges, that between $262 and $917; and for insti- 
tutions of the conventional type, that between $286 
and $623. For the medians of the second totals the 
differences are approximately equal to those of the 
first, except for the private junior-college group, for 
which it is reduced by somewhat more than $200. 
2. Asecond notable tendency to difference in both 
totals is that between the figures for public junior 
colleges when they are contrasted with the two re- 
maining groups of institutions. For example, the 
medians in the first totals for students at home are 
less than half as large for public junior colleges as for 
the other two types of institutions, and the medians 
[ 150 ]

in the second totals show even greater proportion- 
ate differences. The costs for students not living at 
home while in attendance likewise show significant

differences in favor of public junior colleges, although 
these differences are not proportionately as large. 
3. A third tendency to difference is that between 
the totals for private junior colleges as compared with 
institutions of the third group, the colleges and the 
[1st]  
-P-A-G-E-164
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
state university. This is usually in favor of institu- 
tions of the latter group. 
The difference between the total cost of attendance 
when a student attending a public junior college lives 
at home and when he lives away from home is ac- 
counted for almost entirely by the cost of board and 
room. This does not mean that the cost of food dur- 
ing nine months for a student living at home is negli- 
gible. A careful estimate of the cost of food for young 
adults living at home (leaving out of account the item 
of labor) places it at $135 for a period of nine months. 
To make a fair comparison with costs for students 
away from home it is necessary to add this item of 
probable cost of food to the total annual expenses. 
Such addition would not be called for in the case of the 
cost of room, since provision for the member of the 
family will usually be available whether he attends 
while living at home. or elsewhere. In other words, 
there would seldom be additional outlay from the 
family income for rooming accommodations for a 
student who lives at home while attending a local 
institution. 
The items that account for the differences between 
the public junior colleges on the one hand and the two 
remaining types on the other are primarily tuition and 
incidentals; but laundry, texts, and travel are partly 
contributory. Since many public junior colleges make 
no tuition charge or make a charge only for nonresi- 
[152 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
    
DEMOCRATIZATION 
dents, the median cost on this item is very low for this 
group. It is considerably higher for private junior 
colleges than for other higher institutions, the differ- 
ence having its explanation primarily in two facts: 
(1) the lower tuition charge in the state-university 
group, which furnished almost a third of the students 
in the colleges and universities who supplied estimates 
of cost on these-items, and (2) the fact that some of 
the students in the private junior colleges were taking 
work in special departments like music and art, for 
which additional tuition charges are made. 
Since the data presented concern types of units 
rather than particular schools, they must hide differ- 
ences in yearly costs among the institutions of any 
single type. Differences in total costs among public 
junior colleges are primarily determined by differences 
in tuition, which range from no cost to the student to 
a maximum of $100 in a single school. The median of 
students’ estimates of total costs (for students away 
from home) in a low-cost private junior college was 
found to be $526, and in a high-cost institution in 
the same group, $1346. The range of medians in 
the standard higher institutions represented was 
$524 to $700. 
The outstanding findings of this study of the esti- 
'mates of expenditures by more than two thousand 
students in twenty-eight different institutions are that 
attendance while living at home is much cheaper than 
[153 ]
-P-A-G-E-166
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
attendance away from home, and that, since public 
junior colleges serve local constituencies primarily, 
the argument of popularization through lowered cost 
—and it is a powerful argument—applies more par- 
ticularly to this type of unit rather than to the other 
types. Another conclusion of some moment is that 
for students away from home the standard higher in- 
stitution tends to be somewhat less expensive than the 
private junior college, although there is sufficient va- 
riation from unit to unit to afford exceptions to the 
rule. The cost of attendance in public junior colleges 
for students away from home is lower than in either of 
the other types, but it is likely to rise somewhat as the 
numbers of such students increase to the point of re- 
ducing the proportionate frequency of living accom- 
modations for students in the communities in which 
such units are located. 
Popularization through propinquity of opportuni- 
ties for higher education. In Chapter X, where an 
effort is made to locate the size of community and of 
high-school enrollment in which the establishment of 
junior-college units of desirable minimum size would 
be feasible, certain facts are presented which have 
meaning also for the present problem. At one point 
reference is made to the proportion of the population 
(that is, the number in each 1000 of the total) repre- 
sented by those of its high-school graduates who in a 
particular school year were enrolled in either of the 
[ 154 ]
-P-A-G-E-167
  DEMOCRATIZATION 
first two years of work in higher institutions. As some 
of these communities contain local higher institutions 
—usually colleges—it has been possible to compare 
the proportions in communities with such higher 
schools and those without them. For the latter these 
proportions average 5.6 per 1000 of the population ; 
for the former, 10.9. This is the same thing as saying 
that the presence of a higher institution in the com- 
munity almost doubles the proportion of its popula- 
tion who secure the benefits of the first two years of 
college education. 
Reference is made at another point in the same 
chapter to the percentages which those graduates from 
the high schools who are in the first two years of 
higher institutions constitute of the total enrollment 
of the high schools. Here again, high schools in com- 
munities with and without local higher institutions are 
compared. The respective average percentages are 
11.8 and 17.3, showing a difference of 5.5 per cent. 
This difference represents an increase in the propor- 
tion of almost a half—a difference in favor of high 
schools in communities with local higher institutions. 
Both of these comparisons demonstrate that propin- 
quity of higher institutions affects the proportions 
favorably—tends to popularize higher education. 
The fact that there are those who take up their resi- 
dence in communities with colleges in order the more 
easily to provide the opportunities of higher education 
[155]
-P-A-G-E-168
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
for their sons and daughters adds to, rather than sub- 
tracts from, the inference drawn as to the large extent 
of popularization—or of economic democratization 
—of higher education. 
Occupational distribution of the fathers of students 
in secondary and higher institutions. Still another 
test of whether the junior college is designed to foster 
the economic democratization of higher education is 
made possible through a canvass of the occupational 
distribution of fathers as reported by the students who 
were appealed to for the information used in this sec- 
tion. The form and methods of inquiry adhered as 
closely as possible to those used by G.S. Counts’ in his 
report of a recent investigation of the social composi- 
tion of the student-body in secondary schools. The 
single exception as to the form of inquiry used is that 
for Harvard freshmen. The data used for this group 
were taken from the admission books of the institu- 
tion; these supply, among other items of information, 
the “business or profession” of the father. 
The total number of students included in this study 
is 2744. Their distribution to the several groups un- 
der which they are studied are public junior-college 
freshmen and sophomores, 1062; private junior- 
college freshmen and sophomores, 705; college and

state-university sophomores, 346; Harvard freshmen, 
631. The sophomores of the public junior-college 
group, 281 in number, are also given separate con- 
sideration at one point. Of the sixteen public junior — 
colleges represented three are located in California, 
one in IIlinois, two in Iowa, one in Kansas, one in 
Michigan, four in Minnesota, two in Missouri, one in 
Texas, and one in Wisconsin. With the exception of 
the one in Wisconsin, which is a unit in a normal 
school, all are in city or high-school districts. One of 
the seven private junior colleges is in Iowa, five are 
in Missouri, and one is in Virginia. One of each of the 
three colleges is in Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, 
and the state institution is the University of Minne- 
sota. Data borrowed from Counts’s study concern 
17,265 students in the public high schools of Bridge- 
port, Connecticut; Mount Vernon, New York; St. 
Louis, Missouri; and Seattle, Washington; and 619° 
students in Phillips-Exeter Academy and the Uni- 
versity of Chicago High School. 
The basis of classification of fathers’ occupations 
was that used by Counts. The order of grouping is 
roughly, but not accurately, that of the economic 
status of the occupational divisions represented, from 
the highest, proprietors, to the lowest, common labor. 
Counts states that the aim was ‘“‘to get classes of rea- 
sonable homogeneity from the standpoint of social 
status, position in the economic order, and intellectual

difficulties not already made clear in his report; the 
single exception was in the use of the data for Har- 
vard freshmen, especially because they did not con- 
tain responses to such questions as, Where or for 
whom does he [the father] work? or Is he owner

cerned. In order to avoid all unfairness as, regards 
the distribution for this institution, these doubtful 
cases were placed in the lower of the two or three 
levels on which they might be classified. With the 
method safeguarded in this way it may be concluded 
that the distribution to the lower levels is at least as 
large as, if not larger than, it would have been had 
answer to the questions quoted been available, as was 
the case in the remaining groups. 
A comparison of the percentage distributions for 
students in public high schools and public junior col- 
leges shows more tendencies to similarity than to 
difference. However, there is a larger percentage in 
professional service and there are smaller percentages 
in clerical service, artisan-proprietors, and manual 
labor, indicating that the public junior college is to 
some extent more economically selective than is the 
public high school. The differences are in kind (but 
not degree) somewhat like those shown by Counts* 
for points lower down in the school system. A larger 
percentage in agricultural service is explained by the 
smaller size of some of the cities in which the public 
junior colleges are located and their proximity to 
farming territory. It is hardly to be assumed that this 
particular larger percentage represents a greater ex- 
tent of economic democratization of education on this 
level, as the fathers of those whose responses fall in

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
this group are all but exclusively farm-owners. The 
same statement is applicable to the large percentages 
for this group for public junior-college sophomores, 
private junior colleges, and sophomores in colleges and 
the state university. 
The percentage distribution for sophomores in pub- 
lic junior colleges is very similar to that for all students 
in this type of unit, but it shows a slightly greater 
extent of economic democratization. This is probably 
explained by a partial tendency of the sons and daugh- 
ters of the more well-to-do to transfer to higher insti- 
tutions elsewhere at the opening of the second college 
year, whereas those on lower economic levels are un- 
der greater compulsion to continue to avail themselves 
of opportunities at lower cost nearer home. 
The distributions for private junior colleges and for 
other higher institutions are sufficiently similar to be 
considered simultaneously. The totals of the first 
two classes of occupations, proprietors and profes- 
sional service, are almost equal, being, respectively, 
44.8 and 45.9 percent. The latter exceeds the former 
in the percentages of those in managerial and clerical 
service and artisan-proprietors, but the former in turn 
exceeds the latter in the proportion in agricultural 
service. The percentages of manual laborers are 
almost equal. 
When compared with the figures for public junior 
colleges, however, the percentages for these two 
[ 160 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
  DEMOCRATIZATION 
groups show some interesting contrasts. The larger 
percentages of those who are proprietors and in pro- 
fessional service are notable, as are also the much 
smaller percentages in manual labor, and the tend- 
ency to smaller percentages in the middle groups of 
occupations. For Harvard freshmen and students in 
the two private secondary schools the differences just 
mentioned are even somewhat more accentuated, 
being especially marked for the last-named group. 
A final check on the degree of economic democra- 
tization achieved in each of the types of higher institu- 
tions represented in this section is afforded by the 
ratios between the fathers in each occupational group 
as shown and the percentages of the total male popu- 
lation forty-five years of age and over in the cor- 
responding groups. The reasons for using figures 
pertaining to men of forty-five and over are presented 
by Counts and need not be repeated here. Two dis- 
tributions have been obtained: one for Minnesota and 
Missouri combined, the other for Massachusetts. 
Data for the two Mid-Western states were used be- 
cause they represent fairly well the distribution in 
most of the states in which the junior colleges, the 
colleges, and the state university are located. For an 
analogous reason data for Massachusetts were used 
in the computation of the ratios for Harvard. 
The significance of the ratios may be the more 
readily sensed if one bears in mind that, assuming 
[ 161]
-P-A-G-E-174
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
families to be of equal size in all the occupational 
levels, equal representation of all occupational groups 
in the higher institutions would result in ratios ap- 
proximating unity. The significant fact is that the 
several groups are far from equally represented. None 
of the types of institution included in the comparison 
has achieved an extent of economic and social democ- 
ratization in which its authorities are warranted in 
taking great pride. Nevertheless the public junior 
college, as shown by the smaller percentages in the 
upper levels of occupations, is farther along the way 
than any of the remaining types. At certain points 
the private junior college compares favorably with 
other colleges in the Mid-West and with Harvard, but 
at others the comparison is not as favorable to it. The 
ratios for agricultural service are not particularly sig- 
nificant, for reasons already given. All things con- 
sidered, the upshot of the comparison on the basis of 
occupational distribution of fathers is a conclusion in 
confirmation of the public junior-college movement. 
Conclusions concerning economic democratization. 
Each of the lines of inquiry pursued for the content of 
this section lends support to the claim that the public 
junior college fosters the economic democratization 
of higher education. This is shown in the fact that 
lowered cost is the most frequently recurring reason 
given by parents for attendance of their sons and 
daughters in local junior colleges rather than in higher

institutions elsewhere, but it is shown more especially 
in the large proportions of these parents who admit 
frankly that they could not afford to send their sons 
and daughters to institutions away from home. It is 
shown in the large proportions of students in all types 
of higher institutions, junior colleges included, living 
at home while in attendance who acknowledge that 
they would be certain or likely to be deprived of the 
opportunities for higher education if they were re- 
quired to attend away from home. It is emphatically 
demonstrated in the lowered costs for students living 
at home while in attendance, the argument applying 
particularly to students in public junior colleges. It 
was shown again in the increased ratio of those en- 
rolled in higher institutions to the populations of com- 
munities, and to the high-school enrollments in these 
communities, in cases where opportunities for higher 
education are immediately accessible. The bulk of 
this increase must be attributed to the reduction in 
costs to those who can attend while living at or near 
home. Most significant of all, perhaps, is the democ- 
ratization shown in the increased proportions in pub- 
lic junior colleges of the sons and daughters of fathers 
in the lower levels of occupational groups, levels less 
frequently represented in other types of higher insti- 
tution. Without doubt we have in the public junior 
college an important influence for the economic and 
social democratization of educational opportunity. 
[ 164 ]
-P-A-G-E-177
  
DEMOCRATIZATION 
The claim is not as apposite to the private junior col- 
lege, although it should not be impossible to make it so. 
It will be essential to keep this important argument 
of economic democratization in the foreground of at- 
tention throughout the consideration of the type of 
junior-college unit to foster. At other points in this 
volume data appear which emphasize the necessity of 
encouraging the establishment of sizable units rather 
than small units. In order to have the argument of 
economic democratization apply, it will be imperative 
to establish the institution primarily in communities 
of good size; otherwise inordinately large proportions 
of students must leave home to attend, thereby remov- 
ing an important justification for the movement. 
It remains to be said that through making the first 
two years of higher education available at lower cost, 
the junior college will often operate to popularize the 
upper years of collegiate and university education by 
reducing the cost of the full course to approximately 
that of the years away from home. To many parents 
and desirable prospective students the cost of four 
full years away from home must seem prohibitive, 
whereas the cost of two years will seem a much less 
insurmountable obstruction. Add to this relief the in- 
creased maturity of the junior-college graduate, his 
advance of two years toward a status of self-help, and 
we are making more feasible for many the completion 
of a full college or professional curriculum.

THE JUNIOR COLLEGE IN ITS CONSERVING 
AND SOCIALIZING INFLUENCES 
I. Tue Junior CoLttEcE AND Home INFLUENCES 
DURING IMMATURITY 
The expectations. Reference to the list of claims 
made for the junior college by its friends, as presented 
in Chapter IT, shows three which although not identi- 
‘cal in significance have elements in common that 
warrant their scrutiny in proximity to each other. 
Two of these were mentioned with notable frequency. 
They concern continuing home influences during im- 
maturity and affording attention to the individual 
student in the junior colleges in ways not possible in 
other higher institutions. The third, proposed by a 
few only of the friends of the private junior college, 
refers to offering better opportunities for training in 
leadership than can be afforded in four-year colleges 
and universities. 
Those who put forward the first of these three 
claims have in mind primarily the conservation of the 
moral interests of the student during the earlier por- 
tions of the college period, when he is often still too- 
[ 166 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-179
CONSERVATION AND SOCIALIZATION 
young and too much in need of guidance to be thrust 
into what is sometimes regarded as the disorganizing 
social environment of the large college or university. 
They would urge that the student, although scho- 
lastically prepared for college work, still requires 
the stabilizing influence of frequent contact with the 
home. The local junior college, they contend, pro- 
vides a solution of this serious problem. 
There is no intent here to enter upon an extended 
discussion of the problem, nor upon a justification of 
the misgivings many friends and patrons of higher 
education entertain with reference to the moral dan- 
gers to the young student in his first years in college 
or university away from home. It will be assumed 
that the dangers are present to some extent, especially 
where large numbers of students attend institutions 
inadequately staffed for purposes of social and moral 
guidance. Probably very few will be inclined to scout 
the presence in such situations of at least some meas- 
ure of moral hazard. The chief item of concern here 
need not be the presentation of evidence to prove or 
to deny the hazard as much as to show whether or not 
those whose sons and daughters attend higher institu- 
tions believe it exists and what effect that belief has 
upon college attendance. 
Statements of parents with children in public junior 
colleges. A pertinent fact which does not require 
establishment is that students are entering college long 
[ 167 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
before social and moral maturity may be presumed to 
have arrived. For instance, the middle 50 per cent 
enter Minnesota above the age of seventeen years nine 
months and below that of nineteen years six months. 
A fourth of the freshmen range in age from fifteen 
years to seventeen years nine months. It would be 
surprising, indeed, if discerning parents with sons and 
daughters of these ages ready for college work should 
not hesitate to remove them from domestic influences. 
In the third and concluding section of Chapter V, 
dealing with the problem of economic democratization 
of higher education by means of the junior college, 
there was presented a digest of the responses of par- 
ents to a simple question designed to ascertain why 
their sons or daughters attended local public junior 
colleges rather than colleges or universities elsewhere. 
At that point, because of its pertinence to the problems 
under consideration, attention was directed in par- 
ticular to the reason most frequently given for such 
attendance—the financial one. It is now appropriate 
to refer to the reason furnished by the second largest 
proportion of all the parents: in actual figures by 118, 
or 27.8 per cent of all the reasons given, and by ap- 
proximately three fifths of the total of 199 parents 
making some sort of response. This reason is the 
opportunity afforded by the local public junior college 
to extend the period of home influence over the early 
years of college attendance. 
[ 168 ]  
-P-A-G-E-181
CONSERVATION AND SOCIALIZATION 
The junior college actually serves in this way. By 
means of a comparison of the ages of freshmen in 
public junior colleges with those of freshmen in the 
University of Minnesota it has been possible to ascer- 
tain whether or not the former type of unit is, after 
the manner suggested, serving to extend home influ- 
ences during attendance upon college work. The 
group of students concerned were freshmen entering 
the College of Science, Literature, and the Arts of the 
university in the fall of 1921, the first 631 in alpha- 
betical arrangement. It appeared that 388 of these 
freshmen, 212 men and 176 women, came from Min- 
neapolis, St. Paul, and suburban communities near 
enough to make possible daily trips to attend regular 
day sessions. This does not mean that they actually 
commuted, but merely that residence was near enough 
to make commutation possible. Those reporting resi- 
dence in the suburban communities constituted an in- 
consequential proportion of the 388. The remaining 
243 students, 167 men and 76 women, came from be- 
yond commutable distances; that is, they would all 
need to be away from home during attendance at the 
university. The grouping here made is intended to 
disclose the difference in ages, if any, between the 
group whom the University of Minnesota was serving 
as would a local junior college, in making possible the 
continuation of the influence of the home, and the 
group who must leave home to attend. 
[ 169 ]
-P-A-G-E-182
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
There are significant differences in ages between 
the two groups, both by sex and by totals. For ex- 
ample, the median difference between men from out- 
side the Twin Cities and those from inside is eight 
months—two thirds of a calendar year. There is 
the same difference for women, and therefore about 
the same for the sexes combined. The ranges of the 
middle 50 per cent show similar or even greater differ- 
ences. It is clear that attendance away from home is 
undertaken at a later age than attendance where fre- 
quent contact with home is possible. 
What is noteworthy in the ages of freshmen in 
sixteen public junior colleges is that they are almost 
identical with those for freshmen in the University of 
Minnesota whose residences are in the Twin Cities. 
This approach to identity takes on real significance 
for the question under consideration when it is called 
to mind that students in the public junior colleges 
come, almost exclusively, from homes in the immedi- 
ate vicinity. It leads to the conclusion that the public 
junior college tends to prevent delay in entering upon 
college work. 
The question may be raised by the inquiring reader 
as to the qualifying effect upon our conclusions of any 
difference that may exist between the ages of high- 
school students in large cities and of those in smaller 
communities which would account for the difference 
between the ages of freshmen in the University of

Minnesota from within the Twin Cities and of those 
from without. If there is a corresponding difference 
in the ages of high-school seniors, the facts presented 
would be without meaning for the present problem.

St. Paul. The respective medians for the two groups 
show a close correspondence, being seventeen years 
seven months and seventeen years six months. There 
is no difference in ages found in these data that will 
explain away the differences between freshmen inside 
the Twin Cities and those from outside. 
Conclusion. The main findings of this section are 
(1) that large proportions of freshmen are so young 
as to justify discerning parents in their feeling of in- 
security about the moral welfare of their sons and 
daughters in large colleges and universities inade- 
quately staffed for social and moral guidance, (2) that 
large proportions of parents of students in junior col- 
leges indorse the new unit because it does make pos- 
sible the continuance of home influences during the 
first years of college work, and (3) that this attitude 
is sufficiently general to influence markedly the age at 
which young people of both sexes enter college. More- 
over, (4) the presence in the local community of 
opportunities of higher education tends to lower the 
age at entrance as much as from six to nine months, 
or, conversely, the absence of such opportunities tends 
to delay it by that long. 
Not all this unfortunate loss of time is imputable to 
immaturity alone. Without question some of the de- 
lay is attributable to financial causes, as when a stu- 
dent remains out for a year to work and lay aside funds 
against the expense of subsequent attendance. There 
[172]
-P-A-G-E-185
    
CONSERVATION AND SOCIALIZATION 
must even be other occasional causes for postpone- 
ment of entrance upon college work. But there can 
be no reasonable doubt that immaturity and parents’ 
fears of its consequences are a potent factor, if not the 
predominant one. In so far as this is so, the junior 
college will operate to remove the obstruction and will 
make it possible for the home to exercise its conserving 
influences over a larger proportion of the period of 
social immaturity. 
II. THE JUNIoR COLLEGE AND THE 
InpivipuaL STUDENT 
The claim made. The second of the claims made in 
this chapter is that the junior-college unit is better 
designed to afford attention to the individual student 
than are the larger institutions. The assertion is made 
in the light of the fact that, enrollments being smaller, 
classes are not so large, and the individual student is 
therefore not so likely to be lost sight of as he is in 
educational units with larger class registrations. 
It is shown in the third section of Chapter V that 
this is one of the four reasons most frequently given 
by parents for sending their sons and daughters to 
local junior colleges rather than to higher institutions 
elsewhere. This explanation was found to include 47 
of the total of 423 reasons volunteered. As there were 
199 parents responding, this means that it was a 
[173 ]
-P-A-G-E-186
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
prominent influence in the minds of almost a fourth 
of all answering the question. 
Facts as to the size of class sections in higher institu- 
tions, including junior colleges. The method of scru- 
tiny of this claim was simply that of tabulating the 
size of classes on the junior-college level as reported 
by instructors appealed to in public and private junior 
colleges and in four-year colleges and universities. 
A total of 43 institutions are represented in the find- 
ings here reported. Of these, 27 are junior colleges 
(20 public and 7 private), 14 are standard four-year 
colleges, and 2 are universities. To save space the 
names of the junior colleges represented will not be 
given, but it may be said that the public institutions 
are located in eight different states, and the private 
institutions in three different states. The four-year 
colleges are Agnes Scott, Alma, Amherst, Bates, Cor- 
nell, DePauw, Hillsdale, Lawrence, Park, Pomona, 
Puget Sound, Wellesley, Whitman, Willamette. They 
are located in eleven different states. The two uni- 
versities are Stanford University and the University 
of Wisconsin, both of them, as are most of the colleges, 
wrestling with the problem of rapidly mounting en- 
rollments. In these universities, only the departments 
of English, mathematics, chemistry, and history were 
appealed to for information, on the assumption that 
data from these would adequately represent the situa- 
tion for the first two years of university work. A total 
[174]
-P-A-G-E-187
  
CONSERVATION AND SOCIALIZATION 
of 430 different instructors are represented in the data 
utilized —138 in public junior colleges and 60 in pri- 
vate junior colleges, 123 in four-year colleges, and 
10g in universities. This means that 198 were teachers 
in junior colleges and that 232 were teachers in col- 
leges and universities. Information was secured in 
such a way as to assure that the findings should be 
representative of all these groups. 
Percentages of large classes in junior colleges, four- 
year colleges, and universities. One mode of compar- 
ing the size of class sections in junior colleges and 
universities is by their percentages of classes in excess 
of thirty students. Of such classes the junior colleges 
have only 11.6 per cent, the remainder being classes 
of thirty students and less. In contrast it was found 
that the other types of higher institution had 32.7 per 
cent, or almost three times the proportion. 
Between public and private junior colleges there 
is little difference, the former having 10.7 per cent 
of large classes, the latter 13.5 per cent. The four- 
year colleges and the universities likewise differ only 
slightly in their percentages, which are, respectively, 
33-1 and 31.9. A closer scrutiny, however, of these 
large classes in these two older types of higher institu- 
tion shows a tendency to somewhat larger instructional 
units for the universities; for of the 126 classes in 
excess of 30 in the colleges the median is only slightly 
in excess of 40, whereas for the 69 university classes 
[175] 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
of this size the median is approximately 60, or 20 
students larger than for the colleges. 
Another comparison of the size of class sections. 
A second mode of comparing the instructional units 
is by the median size of the class and the range of 
the middle 50 per cent of the classes when they are 
arranged in the order from least to greatest. This 
method, again, shows little difference between the two 
types of junior colleges or between the two older types 
of higher institution, although it does corroborate the 
conclusion in respect to the difference found between 
junior colleges on the one hand and colleges and uni- 
versities on the other. 
Size of classes in small, medium, and large junior 
colleges. Since, as was seen in Chapter I, junior col- 
leges differ widely in total enrollments, and since the 
magnitude of these enrollments must have much in- 
fluence on the size of class in any unit, special inquiry 
has been made on this point in order to note the size 
of enrollment in junior colleges at which the argument 
of small size of class ceases to apply. For this pur- 
pose the twenty public junior colleges so far repre- 
sented in this chapter were distributed into three 
groups including eleven “small,” seven “medium,” 
and two “large” units. The small junior colleges here 
include those enrolling a total of 100 students or less; 
the medium, those enrolling from 100 to 200; the 
large, those enrolling over 200. Unfortunately the 
[ 176 ]
-P-A-G-E-189
  CONSERVATION AND SOCIALIZATION 
distribution of institutions is not even over the full 
range of size. The disability applies especially to 
the middle group, most of which enroll nearer 100 
students than 200. This makes the middle group not 
unlike the group of small units, and this similarity is

reflected in the measures of size of class presented. 
However, as will be seen, this special inquiry has much 
meaning for the validity of the claim under considera- 
tion—the larger extent of individual attention pos- 
sible in junior colleges. 
The measures of tendency show no large difference 
between the size of classes in small and medium junior

colleges. The real increase appears where large junior 
colleges are concerned. In these the classes seem to 
approximate the size of those in colleges and univer- 
sities, although there is some difference in favor of the 
junior-college units at the upper limit of the range 
of the middle 50 per cent in the total distribution.

The evidence presented at other points in this 
volume—more especially in Chapter X, but elsewhere 
also—favors the establishment of only sizable junior 
colleges rather than small junior colleges. It is there 
recommended that the type to be fostered should have 
an enrollment of 200 or more students. The meaning 
for the claim now being considered is apparent: if 
recommendations of this sort are to be put in opera- 
tion in the establishment of junior colleges, a good

CONSERVATION AND SOCIALIZATION 
portion of the argument of a larger extent of individual 
attention because of smaller classes is removed. Cer- 
tainly it cannot be accepted in the unqualified form in 
which it applies to the less desirable units enrolling 
fewer than 200 students. On the other hand, even in 
units of good size there would be some validity to the 
claim. There could, moreover, be no such large classes 
as are sometimes found in colleges and universities. 
The influence of large institutional registrations. 
The problem of attention to the individual student is 
not, however, solely a problem of the size of the classes 
to which he is assigned, however important this factor 
may be. It is in part a problem of sheer magnitude of 
the total enrollment of an institution. Even were all 
classes kept to teachable size, there must be a tend- 
ency toward loss of sight of the individual when enroll- 
ments mount as they have during the last third of a 
century. For example, in the University of Minne- 
sota the enrollment of freshmen increased from 254 in 
1889-1890 to 3053 during the autumn quarter of 
1919-1920. And for most of our higher institutions 
there have been similar, when not equivalent, incre- 
ments. Despite efforts to have these large entering 
classes distributed to units of manageable size, which 
has not always been possible, there must almost cer- 
tainly follow the process designated by McConn’ as 
1Max McConn, “ The Freshman Flood,” in Survey, Vol. XLVIII, pp. 299- 
305 (May 27, 1922).

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
the “depersonalization” of the process of higher edu- 
cation. Such a superfluity of students for facilities 
available must almost inevitably result in a temptation 
to prodigality in dealing with them, to a disparage- 
ment of the individual when the loss of a considerable 
number of students cannot affect appreciably the total 
number still remaining. Since there is no prospect of 
early abatement in the growth of registrations, the 
elevation of the individual to a place where he is likely 
to have anything like adequate consideration, espe- 
cially during the earlier years of the college course 
when this is still essential, seems to wait upon a reor- 
ganization of higher education which distributes the 
student-body to smaller groups than is now the prac- 
tice. The general establishment of junior colleges 
would make this possible. 
Epitome. The evidence presented concerning the 
size of classes in junior colleges and in four-year col- 
leges and universities is to the effect that institutions 
of the former type have at present a distinct advan- 
tage. If, however, sizable junior-college units only 
are fostered, the pertinence of the argument of more 
attention to the individual student because of smaller 
classes in junior colleges will be reduced, since we 
have found that the sizes of classes in units of good 
size approach those in higher institutions, even if they 
do not equal them. The argument, however, will 
doubtless always be in some part applicable. 
[ 180 ]

CONSERVATION AND SOCIALIZATION 
But size of class itself does not comprehend all the 
problem of attention to the individual student. The 
junior college, even if it is fostered only in sizable 
units, by merely reducing the total number of students 
in a single institution will place a check on the process 
of depersonalization in higher education,—a process 
which is encouraged by the mere fact of a large total 
registration,—and it will do so during those college 
years when attention to the individual student is most 
imperative. 
III. THe Junior CoLttece AND TRAINING IN 
LEADERSHIP 
Extra-curricular organizations in junior colleges. 
It has already been indicated that among the aspira- 
tions entertained for the junior college is the hope that 
it will afford better opportunities for experiences 
which constitute “laboratory work” in leadership 
than do larger institutions like universities. It will 
be the concern of this section to inquire into the extent 
of justification for the aspiration, first, by ascertaining 
the scope of extra-curricular activities ; second, by re- 
porting the extent of student participation in them as 
compared with that in other higher institutions; and, 
third, by comparing the frequency with which stu- 
dents in junior colleges and other higher institutions 
are officeholders in student organizations. 
[ 181 ]  
-P-A-G-E-194
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
The variety of extra-curricular organizations found 
in operation in junior colleges is wide. The large divi- 
sions under which they may be grouped are athletic, 
literary, musical, and social and religious. Under these 
have been listed the particular interests represented 
by the organizations. Under what may be designated 
as athletic activities were found basket-ball teams, 
football teams, baseball teams, track teams, swimming 
teams, etc., hiking clubs, tennis clubs, and athletic 
associations; under literary activities were literary 
societies, debate, dramatics, oratory, the school paper 
and other publications, and clubs for language, his- 
tory, science, English, reading, and the like ; the musi- 
cal organizations included choral societies, glee clubs, 
orchestras, and bands; and the social and religious 
groupings comprehended the Christian associations, 
other religious organizations, students’ councils, etc. 
While from considerations of limitations of space 
and of monotony to the reader it is deemed inadvisable 
to report the number of times each of these many 
kinds of student activities was met with, it is not out 
of place to give some notion of their average frequency 
in all the junior colleges visited by the writer. For 
twenty-six public junior colleges in which personal 
inquiry was made on this point there were an average 
of 11.2 extra-curricular organizations. For sixteen 
private junior colleges the average was slightly higher, 
being 11.9. 
[ 182 ]
-P-A-G-E-195
  CONSERVATION AND SOCIALIZATION 
The expectation that junior colleges with the larger 
enrollments will maintain larger numbers of organiza- 
tions is borne out by further examination of the data 
assembled. For the purpose here in mind the public 
junior colleges were divided into three groups: six 
junior colleges with enrollments of less than 50 stu- 
dents, eleven with enrollments of 50 to 149, and nine 
with enrollments of 150 or more. Each of the four 
divisions of activities—athletic, literary, musical, and 
social and religious—shows an increase from the 
smallest to the largest junior colleges, an increase re- 
flected in the average total numbers. These averages 
are, respectively, 8.5, 10.0, and 14.4. These figures 
show a much larger increase between the second and 
third groups than between the first and second. From 
the standpoint of those who have confidence in the 
educational efficacy of well-conducted extra-curricular 
organizations, this fact urges the establishment of 
junior colleges of good size, rather than small units 
with few such interests and with small numbers of 
students participating. 
The reader perhaps hardly needs to be admonished 
that the figures cited cover all degrees of effectiveness 
of functioning, from organizations with scarcely a 
spark of vitality to those at the other extreme, 
conducted with vigor and operating as important 
instruments of student self-education, social and 
otherwise. 
[ 183 ] 
   
-P-A-G-E-196
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
A study of the distribution of memberships held in 
extra-curricular organizations was made, involving 
four groups of students as follows: 995 in fifteen 
public junior colleges, 680 in seven private junior col- 
leges, 227 in three standard four-year colleges, and 
116 in a state university. The data for junior colleges 
concern both freshmen and sophomores, predomi- 
nantly the former; those for the remaining higher 
institutions concern sophomores exclusively. This 
difference in classification of students would be likely, 
if it influences the results at all, to be unfavorable to 
the distribution in junior-college groups. 
The largest percentage of students holding no mem- 
berships is in the university group, where it attains 
almost a third. For the public junior-college group 
the proportion is between a fifth and a fourth of all. 
It is almost equal in the two remaining groups, drop- 
ping as low as 7.9 and 7.0 per cent, respectively, for 
private junior colleges and four-year colleges, the 
similarity perhaps having its explanation in the fact 
that almost all the private junior colleges were for- 
merly institutions claiming to do full college work and 
have in consequence carried over similar tendencies 
with respect to extra-curricular activities. The aver- 
age numbers of memberships held per student were 
as follows: in public junior colleges, 2.2; in private 
junior colleges, 3.4; in four-year colleges, 3.2 ; in state 
university, 2.0. 
[ 184 ]
-P-A-G-E-197
  CONSERVATION AND SOCIALIZATION 
Comparison of officeholding by sophomores. Since 
laboratory training in leadership is afforded in direct- 
ing these student affairs more than through mere 
membership in them, a better criterion by which to 
compare the institutions in the respect concerned is the 
extent to which students on the junior-college level in 
the four groups hold office in these organizations. A 
portion of such a comparison is provided in the fol- 
lowing percentages of sophomores reporting no offices 
held: public junior colleges, 78.6; private junior col- 
leges, 58.8; four-year colleges, 85.1; state university, 
91.5. The average numbers of offices held are roughly 
in harmony with these, being, respectively, 0.3, 0.7, 
0.2, and 0.1. The contrast to be found here between 
junior colleges on the one hand and other higher - 
institutions on the other has its explanation in the 
absence in junior colleges of upper-classmen, who, in 
the other institutions, are naturally elected to the posi- 
tions of leadership, leaving few offices available for 
under-classmen. There are differences in each pair 
of types of institutions: for the junior colleges the 
differences are in favor of the private group; in the 
two remaining, in favor of the separate college. 
Conclusions. Inquiry into the extent to which extra- 
curricular organizations are in operation in junior 
colleges shows a wide range of interest already repre- 
sented, with a somewhat greater numerical frequency 
in private institutions than in public institutions. 
[ 185 ]
-P-A-G-E-198
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Larger units naturally provide greater possibilities in 
this direction than can those with small student regis- 
trations. In so far as these activities are to be re- 
garded as legitimate instruments of training, this 
constitutes an added objection to the very small 
institutions, of which a number are in existence. 
The extent of student membership in these organi- 
zations reaches its highest point in (1) private junior 
colleges, the three remaining types of institution rank- 
ing in the order of (2) separate four-year colleges, 
(3) public junior colleges, and (4) a state university. 
As this comparison did not distinguish between fresh- 
men and sophomores in the junior-college units, al- 
though only sophomores were represented in the other 
institutions, one which did so would find these units 
in even a more favorable position than has been 
shown. 
In the more critical comparison of officeholding by 
sophomores both types of junior colleges outdo the 
other types of higher institution, the contrast being 
attributable to the absence in the former of upper- 
classmen, to whom the positions of responsibility 
would otherwise go. 
There is no assumption by the writer that in their 
present state of development and supervision all types 
of extra-curricular organization are uniformly valu- 
able means of training, either in leadership or other- 
wise. Without an acquaintance with what goes 
[ 186 ]
-P-A-G-E-199
  
CONSERVATION AND SOCIALIZATION 
forward under many of the names reported, mere 
numerical frequency can easily result in an exag- 
gerated notion of their present value, both in junior 
colleges and in colleges and universities. Moreover, 
it is probable that with their longer standing and 
greater magnitude the activities in the older types of 
institution are more frequently estimable instruments 
of education in leadership than those in the smaller, 
newer units. The numerical data, nevertheless, assure 
us that as these activities come to be administered 
with a view to their educational possibilities, which 
is almost certain to happen in all types of institution, 
the junior college will not lag behind its older sisters 
in the educational family. In fact, the larger pro- 
portionate extent of officeholding in junior colleges, 
owing to the absence of upper-classmen, assures us that 
as we attain the desired level of efficiency, students 
in the junior college will have much more satisfactory 
conditions for laboratory work in leadership than will 
freshmen and sophomores in institutions in which 
upper-classmen naturally fall heir to the positions of 
responsibility in extra-curricular activities. 
Each of the three contentions of the advocates of 
the junior college which have been scrutinized in this 
chapter has been found to have the corroboration of 
the facts presented. Establishment of junior-college 
units actually operates to prevent delay in the local

-P-A-G-E-200
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
student’s entrance upon college work, giving assurance 
that parents look upon the junior college as a means 
of extending home influences during immaturity. In 
these days of large and mounting enrollments in col- 
leges and universities, with the accompanying increase 
in hazard for the socially immature in attendance, it 
is imperative that some adequate agency of conserva- 
tion be instituted. The exercise of this influence will 
be further enhanced by such enrollments in junior 
colleges as permit a larger regard for the individual 
student both in and out of the classroom, counter- 
acting the tendencies to depersonalization now too 
marked in the earlier years at least of our typical 
higher institutions. If to these forces is added the ex- 
pansion of opportunities for self-education in leader- 
ship made possible by the absence of upper-classmen 
in the junior colleges, it may be seen that this new 
institution has potentialities of conservation and 
socialization during these two school years not pos- 
sessed by present-day colleges and universities.

THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION IN 
HIGHER EDUCATION 
I. SpectaL PurRPOSES OF THE JUNIOR COLLEGE 
ON REORGANIZATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION 
In the list of current conceptions of the special pur- 
poses of the junior college as presented in Chapter IT 
are several having more or less intimate bearing on 
the organization of secondary and higher education. 
Among these, to name only a few, are placing in 
the secondary school all work appropriate to it (pur- 
pose 10), fostering the evolution of the system of 
education (11), economizing time and expense by 
avoiding duplication (13), and making possible real 
university functioning (16). The implications of such 
claims are so far-reaching that no study of the 
junior-college movement making any pretensions to 
comprehensiveness could escape criticism if it neg- 
lected to inquire into their validity. This phase of the 
junior-college problem is discussed in this chapter and 
in Chapter VIII, the latter dealing exclusively with 
the problem of overlapping in high school and college, 
the former being devoted to a discovery of the evi- 
[ 189 ]
-P-A-G-E-202
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
dences of the reorganization which is destined to as- 
sign to the junior college a logical place in the school 
system. These evidences are presented as pertaining 
to the problem of reorganization as a whole rather 
than to the validity of each particular claim as given 
in Chapter IT. 
The far-reaching reorganization disclosed in this 
chapter has come upon our secondary and higher 
schools so gradually and imperceptibly that there is 
little general consciousness of its profound character 
and extended ramifications. Indeed, some who are pre- 
sumed to be leaders in the field seem still to be totally 
unaware of it; or, if they see it, they are unappre- 
ciative of its forces, and, like King Canute, endeavor 
to command its tides to recede. They appear by 
their attitudes to assert that the American college 
is today what it has always been, and that it is fore- 
ordained to remain immutable in the future. The 
facts presented render such assumptions untenable, 
but they do much more in throwing light on the justi- 
fiability of the claims of the friends of the junior 
college as to its place in reorganized secondary and 
higher education. 
II. THe Apvancinc AGE OF THE COLLEGE ENTRANT 
Ages of freshmen a hundred years ago and today. 
An important consideration in evaluating the assump- 
tion that the American college has undergone little or 
[ 190 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
no change since its establishment in the colonial period 
and remains today essentially what it has always been, 
is the age of the student. Although it is not a matter 
of common knowledge, some information has been 
available to indicate that during the later decades of 
the nineteenth century students entered college at 
more advanced ages than during the first third of the 
century. Even as late as 1851 a writer in the North 
American Review* speaks of boys entering college at 
fifteen or sixteen and of their need of parental disci- 
pline while in attendance. The marked advance in age 
is shown in the following quotation from an earlier 
president of Harvard: 
In the four consecutive years beginning with 1762, the 
average age of the students on entering college was sixteen 
years and two months, . . . while in the four consecutive 
years beginning with 1860 it was seventeen years and eight 
months. . . . In the first of the above-mentioned groups 
of classes, nearly a third were under fifteen when they en- 
tered... . On the other hand, in the . . , last group 
. . . there was but one under fifteen and only eighteen 
under sixteen.” 
Desirous of securing a more nearly complete de- 
scription of this advance in age of college freshmen by 
a standard method of computing ages, in order that all 
results of comparisons would be valid, the writer ob-

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
tained access to the records of admission to Harvard 
College for a point near the opening of the nineteenth 
century and at points two or three decades apart up 
to 1916. In the half-century beginning about 1830 
and ending with 1880 the median age for this institu- 
tion advanced from sixteen years and three months to 
eighteen years and seven months, an increase of two 
and a third years. From 1880 until 1916 there was a 
slight decline, but not sufficient to warrant anticipa- 
tion of any significant change in this respect for some 
time to come. The typical Harvard freshman of a 
century ago was fully two years younger than the 
freshman of the more recent period. 
The conditions as to ages of freshmen at other older 
colleges in the earlier part of the nineteenth century 
have one essential element in common with that just 
described for Harvard. This is the fact that all the dis- 
tributions show large numbers of students entering at 
eleven or twelve to sixteen and a half years of age. 
Thus, almost a fifth of Amherst’s freshmen during the 
years 1827-1831 were fifteen and a half years old 
and younger, and almost a third were sixteen and a 
half and younger; almost a third of Bowdoin’s fresh- 
men during 1810-1817 were fifteen and a half and 
younger, and between two fifths and a half were six- 
teen and a half and younger; even in Dartmouth, 
where freshmen during 1800-1804 were on the aver- 
age somewhat more mature than in other colleges, a

sixth were fifteen and a half and younger, and more 
than a fourth were sixteen and a half and younger. 
The marked contrast of these ages with those of 
our modern higher institutions can be illustrated for

the Eastern private institution the percentage of those 
entering at fifteen and a half years of age and younger 
in 1916 was practically negligible, being only seven 
tenths of 1 per cent, and those sixteen and a half and 
[193 ]
-P-A-G-E-206
  
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
younger constituted only 6.8 per cent of the whole 
group. For the Mid-Western state university the cor- 
responding percentages were very similar, being, re- 
spectively, three tenths of 1 per cent and 4.4 per 
cent. Scarcely any freshmen enter college today at 
the immature ages at which they were admitted a 
century ago, 
What these facts must mean. Thus we find that 
these early distributions of ages of entering freshmen 
have at least one characteristic in common: they 
show large proportions of students beginning what 
was a hundred years ago regarded as college work at 
an age much below that of college and university fresh- 
men at the present time. At least in respect to the age 
of the student-body there is an outstanding difference 
between the college of the past and that of the present. 
It would be surprising indeed if this advancing age 
were not accompanied by far-reaching changes in the 
college along other vital lines. For example, the ma- 
terials of instruction must have been of such a nature 
that children of the tender years between eleven and 
sixteen could and did accomplish the work. 
Biographers of our earlier poets are accustomed to 
point out, sometimes as though it were an indication 
of extraordinary precocity, the youthful ages at which 
they entered college. Emerson and Lowell, it is re- 
ported, entered Harvard as freshmen when they were 
fourteen and fifteen respectively. Bryant and Long- 
[ 194 ]

fellow were admitted as sophomores when they were 
fifteen, the former at Williams, and the latter at Bow- 
doin. These ages, while not quite typical for their 
generation, have been shown to be sufficiently common 
to detract measurably from the feeling of awe which 
they inspire in the minds of those unacquainted with 
the facts. 
III. THE WIDENING Scope oF ENTRANCE REQUIRE- 
MENTS AND THE DOWNWARD SHIFT OF THE COLLEGE 
CuRRICULUM 
The widening scope of the requirements for admis- 
sion. It would be surprising indeed if the advancing 
age of the college entrant, discussed in the fore- 
going section, were not accompanied by an increasing 
amount of educational content required for admission. 
Such a tendency is just what strikes one’s attention 
with most emphasis when he attempts a summary of 
the changes which have taken place in the require- 
ments for admission to college during the last hundred 
years. The nature of the changes must, as in the case 
of the study of the ages of college entrants, be shown 
by reference to Eastern institutions which have main- 
tained continuous existence throughout at least a cen- 
tury. They will be illustrated for Amherst and Yale, 
which, on account of the great similarity of the New 
England colleges in this respect, may be looked upon 
as typical. 
[ 195 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-208
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Throughout most of the nineteenth century the re- 
quirements for admission in the classical languages, 
although experiencing some change, were character- 
ized by relative stability. Preparation in both Latin 
and Greek was prescribed in the twenties and thirties. 
In fact, the only prescriptions for entrance outside 
these fields were, as will be pointed out again, in such 
subjects as are now typically found only in the ele- 
mentary school; namely, arithmetic, English gram- 
mar, and geography. Near the end of the first third 
of the century the content in which examinations for 
entrance were set was Latin grammar, Sallust or four 
books of Czsar’s Commentaries, the orations of 
Cicero, Virgil, and Latin prosody. By the end of the 
century Sallust had given way entirely to Cesar, and 
Yale had prescribed Ovid’s Metamorphoses. During 
this period the amount of material read had dimin- 
ished to some extent; for instance, in the number of 
Cicero’s orations and the range of content selected 
from the Amneid, the Bucolics, and the Georgics, 
but there seems to have been no marked change in 
this respect. 
In Greek the prescription in grammar was, of 
course, persistent throughout the period, but the par- 
ticular content read shifted considerably from the 
religious to the secular, as is shown in the change in 
the requirements from the Greek Testament to the 
Anabasis and the Iliad.

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
A careful estimate of the prescriptions in these lan- 
guages in terms of present-day counters places their 
total at something like seven or eight units—not far 
from half of the total amount of current requirements 
of admission to college. 
The real changes in requirements for admission 
during the period considered were outside the field of 
the classics. The only subject prescribed by Yale 
in 1822, in addition to the classical materials, was 
arithmetic. By the middle of the next decade two 
more present-day elementary-school subjects, English 
grammar and geography, were added to the entrance 
examinations. These persisted as requirements until 
near the close of the century. The first subject now 
typically of high-school grade to make its appearance, 
in addition to the work in ancient languages, is what 
we now refer to as elementary algebra, and this pre- 
scription was imposed during the forties. In the pas- 
sage of three decades more the prescription in this 
subject had been extended to include essentially what 
we now designate as “higher” algebra. Before this 
extension was made, plane geometry (Euclid) had 
been prescribed, so that by the end of the nineteenth 
century the equivalent of two and a half units of supra- 
arithmetical mathematics were required where none 
had been prescribed at the opening of the period under 
consideration. Upon the heels of algebra and geom- 
etry came subject after subject, until by the end of 
[ 198 ]
-P-A-G-E-211
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
the century there were, in addition to the prescriptions 
in the classics, those in algebra through quadratics, 
plane geometry, ancient history, French or German, 
and English literature. 
These changes, put in quantitative terms and con- 
sidering only work now regarded as appropriately of 
secondary-school grade, constitute an increase from 
seven or eight units to fourteen or fifteen—now typ- 
ically fifteen or sixteen. In other words, the amount 
of work prescribed for admission to college was at 
least doubled during the period of a century: at least 
two more years of liberal education is being required 
for admission to college now than formerly. This con- 
clusion is in harmony with the advancing age of the 
college entrant already demonstrated, but does not do 
justice to the expansion of typical general education 
preliminary to college training afforded in the rapid 
expansion of the elementary school during the same 
period. | 
The downward shift of the materials of the college 
curriculum. Intimately related in turn to the widen- 
ing scope of entrance requirements is the downward 
shift of most of the subjects which have found place 
in the standard college curriculum during the last 
hundred years. This downward tendency becomes 
evident during even a cursory examination of the cur- 
riculum of any one of our older colleges as set forth 
in the catalogues issued during any considerable period 
[ 199 ]

THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
of years extending from the early decades of the 
nineteenth century as a starting-point. 
A systematic inquiry concerning this depression of 
courses from upper to lower college levels was made 
for three of our oldest and most estimable institutions, 
Amherst, Williams, and Yale, from which only illus- 
trative extractions are made for our present purpose. 
The ancient languages and literatures are the only 
fields in which there was no consistent downward shift. 
The history of the year-place of beginning courses in 
modern language presents a marked decline. Being 
usually sophomore and junior offerings in the thirties 
and forties, these dropped to typically freshman levels 
by the opening of the twentieth century. The first 
course in the history of English literature changed 
from a junior and senior offering of the sixties and 
seventies to a dominantly freshman course in recent 
years. Trigonometry, which was a standard sopho- 
more course in 1825, is now curricular material for 
first-year students, and all other courses in mathe- 
matics have shifted downward, those preceding trig- 
onometry continuing their downward course into the 
secondary school. The sciences, too, joined this down- 
ward trend, courses like physics (‘natural philoso- 
phy”) and general chemistry having been junior and 
senior work in the twenties and thirties to become 
available to freshmen in the later period. Even phi- 
losophy, ethics, logic, and economics (political econ- 
[ 200 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-213
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
omy) joined the downward movement, but did not 
drop as far typically as the sciences. Many courses 
dropped even farther in universities, especially those 
on state foundations, for the reason that they are 
needed as preprofessional work, which is a matter of 
greater concern in these than in institutions like sepa- 
rate colleges ; some of these last adhere to the hope of 
providing only liberal training throughout the four- 
year period. 
It is already obvious that the shift being described 
could not and did not stop at the freshman college 
year. The sequel, the depression of course materials 
into secondary-school offerings, has already been fore- 
shadowed in illustrating the widening scope of college- 
entrance requirements. The subjects seen to have 
been added to prescriptions for entrance—English 
grammar, geography, arithmetic, algebra through 
quadratics, plane geometry, ancient history, French 
and German, and English literature—were all in- 
heritances from college curricula. The first three con- 
tinued their downward career until they reached the 
elementary grades; most of the others have found a 
place in the first two years of our four-year high 
school. 
Nor does this complete the narrative of the down- 
ward progress of courses formerly peculiar to the col- 
lege. Many other courses, some less often honored 
by a place with those prescribed for admission, either 
[ 201 ]
-P-A-G-E-214
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
accompanied those named or followed them in due 
time, among them rhetoric and composition; such 
courses in mathematics as solid geometry, trigonome- 
try, and occasionally college algebra and analytic 
geometry; many courses in science, such as physics, 
chemistry, and those in biology ; economics, sociology 
(as “social problems”) ; and several of the courses 
in history, such as American, English, European, etc. 
What a sound basis they have who refer to the high 
school as the “‘people’s college”’! 
The textbooks of yesterday and today. In order 
the better to compare the courses in the college of a 
century or less ago with their counterparts in colleges 
and high schools of today, a careful examination was 
made of textbooks in use then and now. Some of the 
comparisons were with present-day college texts, more 
often they were with present-day high-school texts, 
and not infrequently they were with both. The com- 
parisons essayed were in the history of English lit- 
erature, rhetoric and composition, plane geometry, 
physics, chemistry, general history, American history, 
and economics, with briefer studies in a few other 
subjects. Only the general conclusion from the com- 
parison is here stated; each of the comparisons tells 
essentially the same story, that the subjects and 
courses during the process of depression. to lower years 
in the system have experienced no apparent dilution. 
On the contrary, among the group of courses consid- 
[ 202 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
ered there are some, such as plane geometry and 
American history, which have been notably extended 
as to content and even intensified as to difficulty dur- 
ing the period of downward trend. All of them, of 
course, are much enriched as to nature of content 
and improved as instruments of education; that is, 
in their pedagogical make-up. 
To those prompted to direct attention to the fact 
that textbooks do not always limit the content of 
courses and that, in consequence, valid conclusions as 
to courses cannot be drawn from a comparison of text- 
books only, it may be said that the farther back into 
the preceding century one goes the less use of supple- 
mentary volumes will one find. Even as late as the 
year 1849 the catalogue of Williams College supplied 
the following information: ‘The College Library is 
open to the Senior and Junior classes the first Friday 
of the term and every Wednesday. To the Sophomore 
and Freshman classes every Saturday.” 
Some of the extensive depression together with un- 
diminished or even increased thoroughness was in- 
evitable as a result of development within each field; 
for instance, from the findings of research in science 
or history. With the enlargement of the content by 
these investigations, advanced differentiations and 
specializations were bound to make their appearance. 
Then came the desire to secure a recognition of these 
differentiations as advanced courses in the college cur- 
[ 203 ]
-P-A-G-E-216
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
riculum; for example, qualitative, quantitative, and 
organic chemistry. Before their introduction was 
feasible it was necessary to lower the general or pre- 
liminary course far enough to make a place for the 
advanced differentiation. After making all allowances 
for this development, the fact remains that the ad- 
vancing age of the student for any given college year 
and the increasing extent of his training before arriv- 
ing at that point made the downward shift of the 
materials in undiluted and even in enhanced form 
practicable as well as desirable. 
IV. THe CHANGING ORGANIZATION OF THE COLLEGE 
CuRRICULUM AND THE FUNCTION OF THE MAJjor 
SUBJECT 
The changing organization of the college curricu- 
lum. As there seemed to be ground for the conjecture 
that there might be some relationship between the 
organization of curricula and the advancing age of 
the college student, an effort was made to note any 
changes in this respect during the last hundred years. 
A canvass of the catalogues of several New England 
colleges at year-points a decade apart through the 
period 1825-1915 disclosed far-reaching modifications 
of which the following characterizations in summary 
for Amherst and Williams are illustrative : 
[ 204 ]

Curricula for both colleges at the opening of the 
period begin as “fully prescribed,” proceed in the 
course of a decade or more to being “‘slightly optional” 
in one or more years of the full course, become increas- 
ingly elective as the decades pass, and wind up by be- 
ing “largely elective with the major system.” In 
other words, they moved step by step from the com- 
plete prescription of a restricted secondary school, 
through gradually increasing freedom comporting with 
the increasing age of the student, to an elective pro- 
[ 205 ]  
-P-A-G-E-218
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
gram which assumes sufficient maturity on the part of 
the student to assure wise selection of subjects and 
courses, and which opens up the opportunity for spe- 
cialization. Out of the curricular chaos that reigned 
during the operation of the largely elective plan 
emerged the major system, which requires the student 
to specialize. 
This major system is at the present time well-nigh 
the universal practice, as is shown by an examination 
of the catalogues issued for 1920-1921 or 1921-1922 
by one hundred and fourteen colleges ; ninety-four, or 
82.5 per cent, require the completion of a major for 
graduation. As intimated, this is the equivalent of 
saying that at least this proportion of the colleges 
require specialization of the student. 
The function of the major. Whatever may be the 
intent of the college authorities in prescribing the 
major, it is important to know its actual function in 
practice. This has been ascertained for something 
less than two hundred alumni of one estimable sepa- 
rate college in the Mid-West by (1) inquiring of them 
the basis upon which they selected their majors and 
(2) studying possible relationships between these 
majors and subsequent occupational activity. 
Three recurring influences appear in the selection 
of undergraduate majors; namely, occupational prep- 
aration, interest in the subject, and esteem for the in- 
structor. The overwhelmingly predominant motive 
[ 206 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
in selection is the first named, which is reported by 
more than four fifths of all the graduates responding ; 
interest is operative with almost two thirds; whereas 
esteem for the instructor induced only 6.6 per cent of 
the graduates to pursue the major reported. 
The proportion of men who made actual occupa- 
tional use of the major subject subsequently to gradu- 
ation was just a half of the total number, that for 
women was 71.6 per cent, and that for all persons 
responding was 61.3 per cent, or a full three fifths of 
the total. 
There is no escape from the inference that for this 
group of college graduates the occupational function 
of the major was the paramount one. This function 
appears both at the time of selecting it and in the use 
made of it subsequently to the completion of the col- 
lege course. Thus the system which emerged from the 
curricular chaos of a quarter of a century ago is not 
merely a recognition of the need for specialization: 
to the student it is preéminently an opportunity for 
occupational specialization, or at least the beginning 
of such an opportunity. This occupational function 
is also in line with the greater maturity of college 
students in these later years as compared with the 
students a century ago. 
[ 207]

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
V. THE OccupaATIONAL DESTINATION OF 
COLLEGE GRADUATES 
The nature of the inquiry. Since the data just dis- 
cussed touching the basis of selection and the function 
of the major now almost universally required indicate 
a large occupational bearing, it is pertinent next to 
present information about the occupational destina- 
tions of college graduates. As the question is particu- 
larly apposite to the graduates of separate colleges of 
liberal arts (that is, those unconnected with large uni- 
versities where opportunities for professional training 
are afforded), this section has to do with graduates of 
such schools only. The colleges represented in the 
study are nineteen in number and are to be found in 
many sections of the country. Almost a thousand 
graduates—988, to be exact—are represented in the 
occupational distribution to be presented, 438 men 
and 550 women. For reasons that will become appar- 
ent they are divided as to being ‘‘one year out” and 
“ten years out,” the numbers in these two groups 
being, respectively, 574 and 414. 
Salient facts of the occupational distributions. 
Scrutiny of the numerical and percentage distributions 
discloses the following significant facts: 
1. For those who have been out but a single year 
the predominant occupation is of an educational sort, 
and for most of these it is teaching of one kind or an- 
[ 208 ]
-P-A-G-E-221
  
THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
other. This group includes more than three fifths of 
all the graduates—almost half the men and three 
fourths of the women. In terms of these first years of 
service of their graduates these colleges must be looked 
upon primarily as teacher-training institutions. 
One Year Our Ten Years Out 
  Fic. 30. Percentages of college graduates in certain occupational 
groups one year and ten years out of college. (Black, all graduates; 
shaded, men; in outline, women) 
2. At ten years out, the proportions of those who 
are still in educational work, both of men and of 
women, have been materially reduced, but the group 
still includes approximately a fourth of all the gradu- 
[ 209 ]
-P-A-G-E-222
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
ates, the percentages of men and women being almost 
identical by this time. 
3. The percentage of women who are home-makers 
by the end of the first year out is not large, but it 
experiences huge accretions during the passage of nine 
years more. By this time those engaged in home- 
making include from one half to three fifths of the 
total number of women graduates. 
4. The “other occupations” begin with a moderate 
percentage of the total number of men and women— 
about a sixth of the whole—but increase to nearly 
half by the end of the first decade. 
5. Advanced study—graduate or professional—in 
the first years after graduation engages the interests 
of about a fifth of the whole, but disappears as an 
interest during the passage of ten years. 
6. The shifts during the intervening period seem to 
be (1), for men, from education and advanced study 
into other occupations ; (2) for women, from teaching 
into home-making. Graduates of both sexes appear 
to some extent to use educational work as a stepping- 
stone. 
7. Many men entering upon educational work shift 
from teaching to administrative positions such as 
superintendencies and principalships. 
8. In the “other occupations” group, among the 
men one year out, the largest single number are in 
“business.” If to these are added those in banks, 
[210]
-P-A-G-E-223
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
there are a total of 13.9 per cent in the business group 
broadly defined. The next largest group are in the 
ministry. Each of these groups is considerably aug- 
mented by the end of a decade, business (with bank- 
ing) including 22.4 per cent. The ministry by this 
time gives occupation to a full fifth. 
g. The only appreciable proportion in “other occu- 
pations” of women graduates who have been out one 
year is to be found in clerical and secretarial employ- 
ments, this classification holding its own after the 
passage of nine more years; a few other occupations 
come into partial prominence as appropriate for col- 
lege women, namely, library work, medicine, and 
social service. 
These facts, joined with those bearing on the ad- 
vancing age of the college student and the adjustment 
in the direction of specialization growing out of this 
and the downward shift of the materials of general 
education, seem to urge that the college give serious 
consideration to a larger extent of occupationalization 
in its upper years than has been characteristic of it to 
date. Data of the sort presented here are testimony 
that the pace toward professionalization demands 
quickening. Touching educational work, which is an 
occupation common to both sexes and the predomi- 
nant one into which these graduates go, colleges should 
either face their obligation squarely or retire from the 
field. Their present attitude is now too much one of 
[err]  
-P-A-G-E-224
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
assuming teacher-training as a by-product, a function 
incidental to the process of liberal education. With 
the rapidly accumulating developments in the techni- 
cal aspects of education it becomes increasingly im- 
perative to make them a part of the professional 
equipment of the teacher previously to his entrance 
upon the work. To do this with the usual staff and 
facilities to be found in many of these colleges is 
quite impossible. The field of education with which 
high-school teachers in training must be brought in 
contact is too wide for one man or a part of one man, 
himself often untrained in the field, to be able to pre- 
‘sent effectively. Moreover, these institutions are fre- 
quently without facilities for practice-teaching, the 
recent demise of their preparatory schools leaving 
* them to the mercy of a critical public in the communi- 
ties where they are located. In these obstructions of 
attitude and inadequacy of facilities there are grounds 
for scouting the expectation that many of them will 
ever be able to assume the obligation we have seen to 
rest upon them. While some colleges are doubtless 
making rapid strides in the right direction, for most 
of them reforms will be required that to the usual 
faculty group in control will seem too revolutionary 
to be permissible. 
If obstructing attitudes of college authorities can 
be overcome, professional training in other predomi- 
nant lines seems more nearly feasible. This would be 
[212 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-225
    
THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
true of the business field and of home-making, and 
also of the preprofessional portions of training for 
those occupations which are to be entered only 
after more protracted periods in higher institutions ; 
namely, law, medicine, and the ministry. It should 
not be impossible, furthermore, for colleges to develop 
professional specialties along some of the lines less 
frequently found in the distributions, such as library 
training, social service, journalism, etc. 
The shift of women from teaching to home-making 
must receive serious consideration in planning train- 
ing for them. Here we are face to face with the 
problem perennially recurring in discussing education 
for women: their preparation for two lines of profes- 
sional service, one likely to be temporary, the other 
permanent. In the face of this double responsibility 
the typical postponement of all professional work for 
women during the full period of collegiate education 
seems decidedly out of place. The facts cited indicate 
that the college could not go far wrong in giving the 
majority of young women occupational training both 
for home-making and for teaching. It would be more 
reasonable, however, to open up opportunities for pro- 
fessional training in wider variety for the field which is 
to be the temporary one. And this double responsi- 
bility urges that the beginning of professionalization 
of women’s training be not postponed long after the 
opening of the senior-college period. In fact, there is 
[ 213 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
little or nothing in the materials just presented, nor in 
any of the other portions of the chapter, to warrant 
us in delaying occupationalization of training more 
than is now characteristic of the senior-college period. 
VI. READJUSTMENTS WITHIN PRESENT-Day 
HicHER INSTITUTIONS 
Accommodations within the separate college. The 
major system is not the only evidence we have of in- 
roads upon our former four-year period of liberal edu- 
cation. One who examines any considerable number 
of recent catalogues of separate four-year colleges and 
compares them with those issued during an earlier 
period will find another frequent difference in the 
accommodations by which they provide a compromise 
on the length of the liberal curriculum, the word 
“liberal” here being used in the sense of intentionally 
nonoccupational. The character and frequency of 
these accommodations will be shown by summarizing 
the results of an examination of the recent catalogues 
of two hundred and twenty-seven randomly selected 
institutions of the “‘small college” type. 
The accommodations are classified under six main 
heads, with a seventh group having something in com- 
mon with the movement, but sufficiently distinct and 
conservative to raise the question of the appropriate- 
ness of including it. These classes are as follows: 
[214]
-P-A-G-E-227
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
1. Affiliation with universities to give combination 
arts-professional curricula, with the first three years in 
attendance at the college. Announcements of this 
sort are found in thirty-one different catalogues, a 
total of 66 curricula appearing, of which the most 
frequently recurring are arts-agriculture, 11; arts- 
engineering, 16; arts-law, 12; and arts-medicine, 20. 
Here are almost 14 per cent of the colleges prepared 
to concede a full year on the four-year liberal-arts 
period, not to mention the proportion of the three pre- 
ceding years assigned to courses of occupational bent. 
2. Arrangements to give bachelors’ degrees when 
later portions of the four-year period are spent in pro- 
fessional or technical schools elsewhere. Closely allied 
with the first type are the arrangements for giving a 
degree for two or three years of residence in a college 
under consideration and (1) the fourth year taken in 
a professional or technical school or (2) the comple- 
tion of a professional or technical curriculum else- 
where. Forty-eight different institutions, or 21 per 
cent, follow practices classed under this head. 
3. Preprofessional curricula two or three years in 
length, without announced affiliation. The 123 pre- 
professional curricula offered in seventy-four of the 
colleges, or almost a third of the whole number, are 
distributed as follows: agriculture, 8; business, 5; 
dentistry, 3; engineering, 24; law, 13 ; medicine, 63; 
nursing, 2; miscellaneous (journalism, forestry, the- 
[215] 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
    THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
ology, etc.), 5. Almost three fourths of these cur- 
ricula are two years in length. 
4. Four-year professional curricula. Some of these, 
such as business administration, aim to give complete 
professional training; others, such as medicine and 
law, give only partial professional preparation. Sixty- 
one colleges, or 27 per cent of the total number, of- 
fered 79 such curricula, with 20, the largest number, 
in business administration, 14 in engineering, 33 in 
home economics, and a scattering distribution to agri- 
culture, forestry, the applied arts, secretarial training, 
journalism, industrial mechanics, law, medicine, and 
public health. 
5. Professional names in titles of departments. A 
total of 190 departments bearing professional names 
were found in one hundred and thirty-one catalogues, 
or almost three fifths of the whole number, the fol- 
lowing being among the most frequent: agriculture, 
business administration or commerce, secretarial train- 
ing, journalism, engineering, home economics, and 
law. Departments of education were omitted from 
consideration, although there are valid grounds for 
including them. The amount of actual occupational 
content offered in the departments listed varies widely, 
some containing only a few courses of an applied 
sort, others including extended offerings. However, 
all instances warrant the conclusion that here are 
accommodations to the desire and need of students 
[ 216 ]
-P-A-G-E-229
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
for a period of nonoccupational collegiate education 
less than four years in length. 
6. Professional courses in departments bearing 
liberal-arts titles. Thirty such courses were found in 
twenty-five different catalogues. 
7. Recognition without substantial accommoda- 
tion. Under this head were tallied all outlines or sug- 
gestions of four-year preprofessional curricula having 
in them practically no genuinely professional material. 
While this type of evidence constitutes no concession 
on the part of the college, and is therefore not included 
in the total of accommodations, the reason most com- 
monly expressed for placing this guidance in the 
thirty-nine catalogues represented was that proper 
election of fundamental studies would shorten the 
time required to complete the curriculum of the pro- 
fessional school. 
The first six of the seven types of modification were 
made by a total of 163, or almost three fourths of the 
227 colleges. The total frequency of the accommoda- 
tions was 539, which is an average of almost two and 
a half per institution when all the colleges are included 
in the computation, and approximately three and a 
third when the 163 making them are included. 
While these accommodations to the pressure for 
abbreviated periods of unspecialized training have 
been distributed to six types, they may be roughly 
divided into two major groups: first, the tendency to 
[217]
-P-A-G-E-230
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
show the student how he may complete his liberal 
training in two or three years and then transfer to a 
professional school, and second, the introduction of 
professional studies into the upper end of the four- 
year period of college training. 
Moreover, the movement to make concessions is 
not a scattered one, but is so general as to’ be almost 
typical. There are, of course, colleges that still main- 
tain a stubborn resistance to what they look upon as 
the illegitimate encroachments of utilitarian motives, 
but they have been seen to be even now a dwindling 
minority. This is in striking contrast with the college 
curriculum of two or three generations ago, which was 
liberal in intent throughout, being fully or almost 
fully prescribed and being without the slightest oppor- 
tunity for specialization by the student. The changes 
here described, as in the case of the change in the type 
of curriculum offered, are in harmony with what has 
been shown to be the greater maturity of the college 
student and the increased extent of his training by the 
time he has arrived at any point in the present college 
curriculum. 
It is desirable to suggest that there is no intent here 
to characterize the materials of professional or other 
occupational training as not possessing liberalizing 
qualities. The aim has been merely to make clear the 
shift from the former unapplied curricula to the partly 
occupationalized curricula of the present day. 
[ 218 ]
-P-A-G-E-231
  
THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
The junior-college line of cleavage in universities. 
It is appropriate at this point to summarize briefly the 
chief characteristics of the movement to introduce a 
line of cleavage between the two lowest years of our 
universities and the remaining years. This does not 
refer to the presence in these institutions of an increas- 
ing number of two-year preprofessional curricula, nor 
to the group requirements for under-classmen and the 
major system prescribed for upper-classmen in the 
liberal-arts units connected with universities, although 
there is something in common between these and the 
division being effected. Attention is directed only to 
the instances of the junior-college-line of cleavage. 
At the present time there are six large universities 
of the West and Middle West operating under the 
plan: the universities of California, Chicago, Washing- 
ton, Minnesota, Leland Stanford Junior University, 
and the University of Nebraska, the reorganizations 
having been effected in the order given. The first 
two were introduced near the end of the last century, 
the others much more recently. Responses to special 
inquiries of other universities show that the step is 
being seriously considered and may soon be taken in 
at least a few more institutions. 
The name given the lower unit has so far taken 
three forms. It is called the “lower division” in three 
universities, the “junior college” in two, and the 
“junior division” in one. 
[219 ]
-P-A-G-E-232
  
  * 
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
In only two of these six universities does the lower 
unit comprehend all lines of work offered to students 
in these two years. In one of these, The University 
of Chicago, the problem of such inclusion is simplified 
by the absence of engineering schools. In Stanford 
University, however, the engineering departments 
have been incorporated in the plan, but not without 
making “‘certain exceptions to the general rules of the 
lower division.”* In the four remaining institutions 
it is either solely or mainly the liberal-arts group to 
which the line of cleavage is applied, except that the 
junior division serves in a preprofessional way all 
schools beginning with the third college year. 
Three of the official bulletins in which descriptions 
of the lower unit are provided seem to have aimed at 
stating its purpose in some way other than merely to 
say that it includes the first two years of the college. 
Each of these three stresses at least one function in 
common, although this is differently expressed in each 
instance. In Stanford University, it is “to introduce 
the student to fundamental fields of human interest” ; 
in the University of California, “it is expected that the 
student. . . will make an effort to establish a basis for 
that breadth of culture which will give him a realiza- 
tion of the methods and results of some of the more

perspective that will aid him in reaching sound judg- 
ment”; and in the University of Washington, ‘‘to con- 
tribute to a broad general training in preparation for 
the advanced work of the upper division.” The only 
important additional purpose posted in these bulletins 
is given for the lower division in the institution last 
named, ‘“‘to supplement the work of the high school.” 
“The object” [of the requirements in the lower unit], 
says the catalogue, “is to secure for the student a 
knowledge of a wide range of subjects, to distribute his 
knowledge over the fundamental fields. To this end 
the high school and college are viewed as essentially 
a unit.” 
Other evidences that a distinction of function be- 
tween the lower and upper divisions is seen are to be 
found in the provisions for advice, the recognition by 
certificate of the termination of the lower division, the 
administrative separation of courses for the two units, 
and the point set for the beginning of specialization. 
A final function of the lower division in three institu- 
tions is that of selection of students for work on the 
higher levels. In the University of Chicago the stu- 
dent is advanced to the senior college when he has 
met, among others, a requirement of the completion 
of “18 majors of work with at least 32 grade points.” 
Similar to this quali-quantitative requirement is the 
one in the University of Minnesota which insists upon 
the completion for promotion of ‘go credits and 90 
[ 221 ] 
   
-P-A-G-E-234
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
honor points.” Somewhat different, but of the same 
general import, is the requirement in the University 
of Nebraska which says, ‘If the sixty hours of work 
required for completion of the lower division is not 
’ completed in the first five semesters of attendance, the 
student is automatically dropped from the university 
unless extension of time be granted by the Senate 
Scholarship Committee.” All these regulations seem 
to be intended to operate as scholastic hurdles which 
must be taken for advancement to the upper unit. 
The major impression resulting from this examina- 
tion of the junior-college movement within the uni- 
versity is that where it appears, it seems founded upon 
a conviction that the functions of the lower years of 
the university—more especially of the college of 
liberal arts—are to be distinguished in considerable 
part from those of the upper years. The upper years 
are assumed to be the proper place for specialization, 
whereas the lower years are still years of general edu- 
cation. This characteristic of the lower division, 
coupled with the emphasis upon the desirability of 
having the work in this division continuous with that 
of the high school, not to mention other administra- 
tive provisions, such as that pertaining to guidance, 
argues that the higher institutions are proceeding as 
if the first two years were really a part of the full 
period of general or secondary education, and that 
higher education proper begins in the upper unit.

VII. THE TREND oF ENROLLMENT IN 
HicHER INSTITUTIONS 
The questions raised. Probably few readers have 
followed the presentation of the materials of the fore- 
going sections without wondering whether the tend- 
encies shown have been reflected to any extent within 
the fact of growth of higher education. Of the recent 
rapid growth of higher institutions as a whole all are 
aware, but curiosity in this instance attaches to more 
detailed aspects of the general situation. Some will 
be disposed to ask, What is the trend of growth of the 
several types of higher institutions represented—uni- 
versities, separate colleges, and professional schools? 
Are they developing at the same rate, or has there 
been a tendency from the standpoint of numbers for 
one or another to dominate the field? Is there any 
difference among the several types as to the trend of 
enrollment in the lower and upper years? Is profes- 
sionalization of curricula in universities increasing or 
decreasing, and how does this affect the proportionate 
distribution of students in liberal-arts and professional 
curricula? Is the proportionate enrollment of lower- 
classmen and of upper-classmen in the liberal-arts unit 
of these institutions gaining or losing, and are there 
differences between the sexes in this respect ? The ma- 
terials of this section are devoted to answering these 
and related questions.

  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
in 1888-1889. Private universities and other public 
institutions (state colleges of agriculture and me- 
chanic arts, other separate publicly supported techni- 
cal schools, and municipal universities) follow rather 
closely with increases of 621.3 and 747.1 per cent 
respectively. The remaining types are ranked in the 
following order, but at some distance from the first 
three groups named: women’s colleges (Class A‘), 
404.7 per cent; men’s colleges and coeducational col- 
leges, 216.9 per cent; schools of medicine, law, dentis- 
try, pharmacy, and veterinary medicine, 112.0 per 
cent. The rates of growth in the professional schools 
(the majority of which are now associated with uni- 
versities) as a whole have been considerably reduced 
by the fluctuations in medicine, one of the predomi- 
nant groups. The actual decline in the rate of growth 
in this group, as is well known, is explained by the 
standardization in the field, a movement which has 
resulted in closing the doors of many of the weaker 
schools. The most marked gains are seen to be in the 
universities and other institutions of polytechnic type, 
rather than in the college groups.

fering rates of growth during the period of three dec-

cause of the relative uncertainty of the requirements for admission to

in a shift in the proportional predominance of the 
types of institution considered. From something more 
than a fourth of the total enrollment in the groups of 
institutions considered, the proportion in state and 
private universities and other institutions of poly- 
technic type mounted to well over a half; whereas the 
proportions for women’s colleges of Class A and men’s 
colleges and coeducational colleges combined dropped 
sharply during the first decade from more than two 
fifths of the whole to less than a third. When the 
percentages for the schools of medicine, law, dentistry, 
pharmacy, and veterinary medicine are added to the 
former group, its position of dominance during the 
last twenty or more years becomes even more appar- 
ent. This fact of numerical dominance may have had 
something to do with the degree to which separate 
colleges have in recent years introduced the curricular 
modifications described in a preceding section. 
The proportions of students in lower and upper 
college years. A study of the proportions of students 
enrolled in the under-classman (first and second) and 
upper-classman (third and fourth) years in large rep- 
resentative samples of the several types of higher 
institutions concerned in this part of the chapter dis- 
closes certain significant related tendencies to change.

tween 1915-1916 and 1919-1920, whereas other 
types showed a marked increase owing to the large 
influx of deferred registrations for 1919-1920. This 
“backwash” for 1919-1920 makes it inadvisable to 
give serious consideration to conclusions from a com- 
parison of percentages for the remaining groups for 
the period from 1915-1916 to 1919-1920, although 
no serious question can be raised against the predic- 
tive value of the percentages during the preceding 
periods. The group made up of state universities, 
other public institutions of polytechnic type, and pri- 
vate universities show no conspicuous change: they 
seem to have been holding their own. However, when 
they are combined with schools of medicine, law, den- 
tistry, pharmacy, and veterinary medicine, they show 
marked progress toward smaller proportions in the 
lower years. On the other hand, the men’s colleges 
and coeducational colleges lost ground almost consist- 
ently. This trend is not striking, but it is unmistak- 
able and, in contrast with the situation in institutions 
with acknowledged opportunities for occupational 
training, should give pause to the friends of the sepa- 
rate liberal-arts college. 
Elimination and transfer from separate colleges. A 
study of retention and elimination in separate colleges 
and of the destination of transfers from these colleges 
affords findings of significance in this connection. The 
first of these is that for thirteen estimable Mid- 
[229]
-P-A-G-E-242
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Western colleges the percentage of students who re- 
main for their third year is 49.0. This is another way 
of saying that for a majority of the entering students, 
the separate college serves as a junior college. The 
facts just presented lead to the expectation that this 
will be increasingly true. The second finding concerns 
that special group of those eliminated who transfer 
to other institutions before completing the four-year 
curriculum. It was possible to ascertain the institu- 
tion of destination of 219 such transferees, 86 from 
eight Eastern colleges and 132 from thirteen Mid- 
Western colleges, of whom a total of 182, or 83.1 per 
cent, shifted to universities or other institutions where 
professional training is available. 
The increase of opportunities for professional edu- 
cation in universities. A count was taken of all pro- 
fessional schools in eighteen large universities of the 
country for each half-decade for the twenty-five years 
beginning with 1894-1895 and ending with 1919— 
1920. The average numbers of professional schools 
per university (not including colleges of liberal arts 
and graduate schools) were respectively 4.2, 4.9, 5.2, 
5.9, 6.5, and 7.3. These figures indicate a steady 
growth. There is little need of mentioning the particu- 
lar schools that were added, except to state that the 
earlier additions were in the older professions, such 
as medicine and law, whereas in later years the more 
frequent additions were in commerce and education. 
[ 230 ]
-P-A-G-E-243
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
The shift of enrollment within the university. The 
same group of universities—six Eastern and twelve 
Mid-Western, Western, and Southern—were studied 
as to proportionate enrollments as follows: (1) the 
percentages of the total enrollment in colleges of liberal 
arts, in junior-college years, and in senior-college years 
of colleges of liberal arts; (2) the percentages of the 
total liberal-arts enrollment in junior-college years 
and in senior-college years ; (3) the division of junior- 
college and senior-college liberal-arts enrollments as 
to men and women; etc. From these computations 
may be drawn several conclusions highly pertinent to 
the problem of organization in higher education. For 
the Eastern universities the most notable change 
shown is the steady decline of the numbers enrolled 
in the last two years of the liberal-arts unit, compared 
with the total liberal-arts enrollment. The downward 
trend is not rapid, but is so consistent as to be un- 
mistakable, dropping by small steps from 45.9 to 40.6 
per cent. Correspondingly, the percentage of junior- 
college liberal-arts students to the entire student-body 
shows a tendency to increase. The decline of the 
senior-college group for the Mid-Western, Western, 
and Southern universities is not so consistent, but is 
nevertheless apparent. Other tendencies in harmony 
with these are to be noted, but the most important is 
the shrinkage in the proportion of men in the senior- 
college years of the liberal-arts unit from 60.1 in 
[231 ]
-P-A-G-E-244
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
1894-1895 to approximately two thirds of this pro- 
portion in the later periods of the quarter-century, at 
the same time that men were much more nearly hold- 
ing their own in junior-college years. 
The decline of students, especially of men, in the 
senior-college years of nonoccupational curricula 
would without doubt appear to be even greater if 
account could have been taken of those registered in 
special occupational programs announced in the cata- 
logues but administered by the liberal-arts unit. Such 
curricula are not offered in all colleges of liberal arts 
in universities, but they are sufficiently numerous to 
warrant the statement made. In the arts college of 
one state university whose catalogue was examined 
reference was made to ten such curricula, for example 
journalism, business administration (five differentia- 
tions), chemistry, etc.; in another there were five, 
such as home economics, economic entomology, and 
chemistry. It may be seen from these illustrations 
that some of the lines represented, as commerce and 
journalism, have in other institutions been erected into 
professional schools. 
Professionalization of training for women is lagging 
behind that for men, as may be judged from the in- 
creasing proportion of women in senior-college years 
of the liberal-arts unit. If recent movements affecting 
the social status and occupational life of women may 
be taken as an earnest of developments of tomorrow,

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
the shift that has taken place for men will also soon 
follow for women. The erection of departments of 
education into schools, which has been taking place of 
late, is one step in this direction. 
Significance for the problem of reorganization. The 
trend of enrollment in higher institutions is in accord 
with other evidences of the forces of reorganization so 
far presented in this chapter. This is true of the rapid 
growth which has resulted in the numerical dominance 
of institutions of the university and polytechnic type, 
in the slow but unmistakable decline of the proportion 
of students in the upper years of separate colleges, 
and in the declining proportion of men in senior- 
college years of the liberal-arts unit of universities, a 
decline unaccompanied by an equivalent reduction in 
the proportion of men in the junior-college years of 
the same unit. It harmonizes with the advancing age 
of the college entrant in that it shows an increasing 
tendency to terminate the period of general educa- 
tion somewhere near the middle of the college course. 
It comports with the changing organization of cur- 
ricula of liberal colleges, which now almost universally 
require specialization in senior-college years. This 
specialization, whatever may be the intent of the col- 
lege authorities in prescribing the major system, is 
entered upon by students with confidence in its occu- 
pational significance. It is in line with the modifica- 
[ 234 ]
-P-A-G-E-247
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
tions within separate colleges, which are in the nature 
of accommodations to the desire of students for an 
abbreviated period of nonoccupational training, as 
well as with the appearance of the junior college as an 
administrative unit in some of our larger universities. 
VIII. THe EvropEan ANALOGY 
The junior college prefigured. The conception of 
the junior college as the culmination of the American 
secondary school and as the feature of reorganization 
of our school system which would usher in the real 
university is not one of recent origin. It has its be- 
ginnings at least as far back as the middle of the 
nineteenth century. Distinctions between the concep- 
tion in its earliest form and that which now charac- 
terizes it are that it was not then designated by the 
name it has come to carry in our own time, and that 
it was not as often thought of as a separate two-year 
unit superimposed upon the unit below or connected 
in some way with other schools in the system. In its 
first stages it seems to have been conceived of more 
nearly as an upward extension of the secondary school 
without a line of demarcation between the two levels 
of training. 
The idea of upward extension took its root in a 
comparison of European (more especially the German 
and the French) school systems with the American 
[ 235 ]
-P-A-G-E-248
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
system, a comparison which seemed to some of the 
educational leaders of the period to put the latter 
in an unfavorable light. Among the defects of our 
system most frequently mentioned were the shorter 
period of secondary education here and the con- 
sequent responsibilities of the higher schools for 
much of general education left uncompleted by the 
lower units. 
One of the first, if not the first, of the American 
leaders in higher education to call attention to the dif- 
ferences referred to and to urge reorganization some- 
what along the lines of the European plans was Henry 
Phillips Tappan. Even as early as 1851, the year be- 
fore he assumed the responsibilities of the presidency 
of the University of Michigan, he wrote a volume 
dealing with university education." He made recom- 
mendations looking to the establishment of real uni- 
versities at the point where preliminary education 
should leave off. To him education had two states— 
the preparatory and the executive. 
After a right worthy discipline of the man, by this pre- 
paratory course, we next proceed to the executive part of 
. education. Under this denomination we embrace 
professional studies, as Law, Medicine, Theology, or the 
studies relating to any course of life for which the individ- 
ual may design himself.’

York, 1851. 2Tbid. p. 12. 
[ 236]
-P-A-G-E-249
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
His convictions as to the nature and organization of 
universities he found embodied in those of Germany, 
for he said: 
We have spoken of the German Universities as model 
institutions. Their excellence consists of two things: first, 
they are purely Universities, without any admixture of col- 
legial tuition. Secondly, they are complete as Universities, 
providing libraries and all other materials of learning, and 
have professors of eminence to lecture on theology, law, 
and medicine, . . . in fine, upon every branch of human 
knowledge.* 
Another educational leader who early sensed the 
desirability of development along somewhat similar 
lines was William Watts Folwell, now president emeri- 
tus of the University of Minnesota. In his inaugural 
address, delivered in 1869, he urged relegating to the 
secondary schools 
those studies which now form the body of work for the 
first two years in our ordinary American Colleges. It is a 
clear case that such a transposition must by and by be 
made. . . . How immense the gain . . . if a youth could 
remain at the high school or academy, residing'in his home, 
until he had reached a point, say somewhere near the end of 
the sophomore year, there to go over all those studies which 
as a boy he ought to study, under tutors and governors! 
Then let the boy, grown up to be a man, emigrate to the 
university, there to enter upon the work of a man... 2

[ 237]  
-P-A-G-E-250
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
In a note accompanying the address as published, 
Dr. Folwell suggests the origin of his idea: 
Away back in the 50’s when the speaker was a schoolboy 
he enjoyed the friendship of Professor Charles A. Joy of 
Columbia College, who had taken up his life work after a 
long period of study in German Universities. From him 
came the knowledge of the Gymnasium, the splendid sec- 
ondary school, fitting German boys for the work of men in 
the university. 
Insistence upon the relevancy of the European or- 
ganization to the American system continued with in- 
creasing frequency toward the end of the century and 
later. It will probably be conceded without argument 
that of the more recent advocates of the type of reor- 
ganization referred to, the most persistent and influ- 
ential was President William Rainey Harper. Among 
others in university circles who have done much to pop- 
ularize the junior-college idea are Edmund J. James, 
Alexis Lange, and David Starr Jordan. Harper seems 
to have inspired the establishment of the first junior 
colleges. It is not to be assumed, of course, that either 
he or any other leader of the period relied solely or even 
primarily on the argument of European analogy: it is 
indicated merely that, as is implicit in the quotations 
from President Folwell, European analogy entered as 
an important element into the thinking which urged 
reorganization. On account of its frequency of recur- 
rence it seems desirable to scrutinize with some care 
[ 238 ]  
-P-A-G-E-251
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
the pertinence of the analogy by attempting a compar- 
ison of French and German secondary schools on the 
one hand with those of the United States on the other. 
Ages of students compared. Assuming that the Ger- 
man boy begins the work of the Vorschule when he is 
six years of age, and is promoted regularly, he would 
be nine when he entered the Sexéa, the first year of 
the Gymnasium, the predominant type of German sec- 
ondary school. Assuming a continuance of regular 
promotion during his progress through the institution, 
he would be seventeen when he entered the Oberprima, 
its ninth and highest class, and nearly eighteen on 
completing its work and equipped for admission to the 
university. If these assumptions were borne out by 
the facts, the German student in the last year of his 
secondary school would be at approximately the same 
age as the American student in the senior year in high 
school, which is typically seventeen and a half years. 
Certain students of the German secondary school, 
however, have made clear that the rate of promotion 
is such as to delay the student’s arrival in the Ober- 
prima and, consequently, in the university. Bolton 
says that during his visits he “‘was surprised to find in 
the upper classes pupils who were no longer boys in 
appearance, but full-grown men, many of them with 
mustaches. They appeared to be fully as old as fresh- 
men and sophomores in American colleges.” He cites 
figures supplied by Dr. Juling, reporting on Prussian 
[ 239 ]
-P-A-G-E-252
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Gymnasia, showing that for the year 1890 only 19 per 
_cent of the graduates were under nineteen years, the 
percentages for the years nineteen, twenty, twenty-one 
and over being, respectively, 26, 26, and 28 per cent.* 
Referring to the ages of students in the Royal Gym- 
nasium in Leipzig, Bolton says that the average age of 
pupils who had just entered the lowest class (Sexta) 
was ten years ten months and sixteen days, which, 
from what has already been said, indicates an average 
retardation at this point of somewhat less than two 
years. ‘The average of the class just finishing was 
nineteen years ten months.” This seems to mean that 
owing to delayed progress, although there are twelve 
years in each of the two systems compared, students 
in the German school were approximately a year and 
a half older on the completion of their secondary edu- 
cation than are American high-school seniors when 
they receive their diplomas. On account of possible 
differences in definition of age it is safer to say that 
they were from one to two years older. At another 
point Bolton shows the average ages of students in the 
last three classes of several German secondary schools, 
mostly Gymnasia, to have been 17.6, 18.7, and 20.1 
years respectively.” The first of these figures is not far 
from that for the ages of seniors in American high 
schools, and this fact, with the ages for the last two

THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
years of the Gymnasium, leads us to conclude that 
there is an even greater difference in ages on the com- 
pletion of the respective secondary schools than that 
drawn from the situation in the Royal Gymnasium in 
Leipzig. Russell, citing data of Thomas Alexander, 
shows that in 1913 the average age of students in the 
Oberprima in the Friedrich-Wilhelm Real-Gymnasium 
at Stettin was 19.0 years,’ which is again approxi- 
mately a year and a half in advance of the age of 
seniors in American high schools. 
The upshot of all this, as well as can be judged from 
the data referred to, is that the student of the Gymna- 
sium at the time of graduation is about as old as is the 
student in American colleges when he is near the end of 
his freshman year or well started on his sophomore year. 
It is relevant to point out that the retardation noted 
obtains despite the long school year, which extends 
over two hundred and forty days. Schools are in ses- 
sion from forty to forty-two weeks of six days each. 
This is approximately a third in excess of the typical 
length of the school year in the United States. 
The French lycée for boys extends over what is 
assumed to be seven years of work, divided into two 
cycles—one of four years, the other of three years. 
The work of its first year is entered upon after the boy 
has completed a primary-school curriculum covering

    THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
four years, this in turn being preceded by a year in the 
infant class, which he normally begins at the age of 
six years. The full curriculum being twelve years in 
length, the French boy presumably arrives in the last 
form of the lycée when he is sixteen years of age and 
completes it when he is about seventeen, or a few 
months before the American highs student en- 
ters upon his last year of work in the secondary school. 
Although no data on age distributions for the French 
schools were available to the writer, there is little occa- 
sion to believe that there is not some extent of re- 
tardation in the lycée as there is in the Gymnasium. 
Promotions are by form and not by subject, as is the 
practice in American high schools, and a failure in two 
major subjects is very likely to result in the student’s 
repeating the work of a form. It is seldom indeed 
that a boy spends less than a full year ina form. It is 
not unlikely that there is as much retardation rela- 
tively as there is in the Gymnasium, although it may 
be that completion of the work of the lycée finds the 
student somewhat younger than the German youth at 
the end of the gymnasial curriculum. 
Curricula compared. A number of obstructions 
present themselves as soon as an attempt is made to 
compare curricula of American schools with those of 
German and French secondary schools. The difficulty 
in comparison is contributed to in no small part by 
distinct differences in the subjects emphasized. In 
[ 242 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
the Gymnasium the emphasis is largely on traditional 
materials, such as ancient languages and mathematics, 
but in the first years of the American college it is on 
work in the mother tongue, modern foreign languages, 
science, and social subjects. Differences so marked as 
these thwart effective comparison in particular sub- 
jects. Another obstructing difference is in the main- 
tenance in Germany of different schools for students 
with different intentions toward higher education, and 
of segregated education for boys and girls in both 
Germany and France. Couple with this the contrast 
of the European secondary school as a distinctly selec- 
tive institution and the American aspiration toward 
universal education on this level, and there results a 
situation which demands, with us, much more in the 
way of elective programs. Another complicating cir- 
cumstance is the differing lengths of secondary-school 
periods. As our organization cuts across the European 
periods of secondary education, this interferes with 
satisfactory comparison, since with their longer periods 
both French and German schools can introduce the 
more characteristically secondary-school subjects ear- 
lier than our schools and can extend their study over 
longer periods. 
A single subject, Latin, will be used in the curricular 
comparison, which must be all too brief. The study of 
Latin is begun in the lowest gymnasial class, the Sexta, 
and is continued throughout the nine-year period. In 
[243 ]

    | 
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
the Prussian Gymnasium of the nineties a total of 
sixty-two hours, or a shade less than an average of 
seven hours per week for each year, were devoted to it. 
Ignoring the differences in the length of the school 
year, if the student in the typical American high school 
carries the full course of study in Latin, he will have 
a total of only fifteen hours, or less than a fourth of 
the work in this subject prescribed in the German sec- 
ondary school. Manifestly the German student should 
be able to cover vastly more ground during his prog- 
ress through his institution, and he should also be 
much farther advanced at any age-point in the course. 
We ought not to be surprised therefore that the lad in 
Untertertia (the fourth class in order from the begin- 
ning) who, according to Bolton’s figures, averages 
14.5 years of age is reading Cesar’s “Gallic War,” 
whereas the American boy does not undertake it until 
the year following. Nor is there cause for wonder if 
more than a single author is read during any one 
year. Among the materials read in this subject in 
Obersecunda, when the boy averages 17.6 years of 
age—practically the average age of the American 
high-school senior—is Livy, Book XXI. American 
college catalogues picked up at random show that this 
is standard content for freshman courses. Again, the 
student in Oberprima (the last year) reads Tacitus, 
which is typically material for our sophomore college 
courses. Once again, there should be no cause for sur- 
[244]
-P-A-G-E-257
  
THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
prise in these last contrasts in view of the longer period 
of Latin study in the Gymnasium and the fact that 
the average Oberprimaner is not much younger than 
the American college sophomore.’ 
The study of Latin is likewise begun in the first year 
of the lycée, the total number of class hours through- 
out the seven years being much more than twice the 
amount that would be devoted to the subject by an 
American high-school student during four full years. 
The ‘Gallic War” is also undertaken earlier. Men- 
tion of other classics read would indicate that students 
in the last year are reading materials to be found in 
the freshman and sophomore courses in the American 
college.” 
Further curricular comparison of European and 
American systems seems to warrant another inference, 
one which touches the total amount of ground covered 
in the subjects represented as affected by the type of 
organization of education in use. Our typical organi- 
zation of an eight-year elementary school, a four-year 
high school, and a four-year college appears to cut 
across the German secondary-school period, if not also 
the French, at two points. We thereby distribute to

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
three different agencies the responsibility for training 
during the period of years concerned. Each of these 
agencies acts in ways to some extent independent of 
the others and without full knowledge of what they 
are attempting. There must in such a situation be 
some overlapping in the work covered—an overlap- 
ping that wastes time and prevents covering as much 
total ground as would otherwise be possible. It is 
therefore to be anticipated that bringing more of these 
school years into a single institution will operate to 
bring our students farther on in the same period of 
years. 
The point of termination of general education. One 
characteristic common to the Gymnasium and lycée 
is not a feature of the traditional American four-year 
high school, and this is the fact that they terminate the 
general education of the student who is going on. The 
university to which the German and the French stu- 
dent are advanced on the completion of the work in 
the lower school is for them a place of specialization. 
On the other hand, in the majority of instances the 
American student who continues his education after 
his high-school course, moves on to an extension of 
his period of general education, an extension which, 
in terms of the organization of college curricula, is two 
years in length. Partial exceptions are students who 
pursue curricula in engineering, agriculture, etc. For 
most students the work of these two years is made 
[ 246 ]
-P-A-G-E-259
THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
general by prescriptions that assure contact with each 
of the main fields of learning. At the close of the two- 
year period the student is required to select a major 
subject, which, as we have seen, he looks upon as occu- 
pational specialization and which, in a majority of 
cases, subsequently serves him occupationally. This 
interpretation of the end of the first two college years 
as the typical American termination of general educa- 
tion for those intent on specialized training has the 
support also of the foregoing sections showing the ex- 
tent to which colleges have made provision for meeting 
the desire of students for a shortened period of unap- 
plied education, the appearance of the junior-college 
division in universities, and the trend of enrollment in 
higher institutions which shows diminishing propor- 
tions of students in the last two years of colleges of 
liberal arts, whether these are separate institutions or 
parts of universities. 
The congruity of the analogy. The major conclu- 
sion from these comparisons is that while the analogy 
of French and German organization of secondary and 
higher education with that proposed by those who urge 
the upward extension of our own high school by the 
addition of junior-college years is far from complete, 
there are significant points of similarity. 
On account of the retardation in the German sec- 
ondary school seen to obtain at the time that the 
analogous relationship was frequently emphasized, the 
[ 247 ]
-P-A-G-E-260
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
average age of the graduate did-not fall far below that 
of our present college sophomores. There is no reason 
to believe that this situation for the lycée is essentially 
different. Although the comparison of respective cur- 
ricula is beset with difficulties, there is sufficient evi- 
dence to indicate that the analogy does not entirely 
break down here, despite the obviously more demo- 
cratic function of the American high school and col- 
lege. In Latin both the lycée and the Gymnasium 
carry the student through the materials covered by 
such of our college sophomores as continue this sub- 
ject; and the like, although not demonstrated here, is 
approximately true for mathematics. These facts are 
especially significant in view of the approach to equiv- 
alence of the ages of students in the last two years of 
the Gymnasium and of the first two years of the Amer- 
ican college. Perhaps the most relevant element of 
the analogy is to be found in the fact that the first two 
years of American collegiate education as now ad- 
ministered are distinctly a part of general education 
and that the years beyond this are now and are in- 
creasingly becoming the period of specialization. ‘The 
college and university with us seem to be standing 
astride the line of division between general and spe- 
cial education. The appropriateness of this element of 
the analogy impresses one especially when he recalls 
the approach to equality of the ages of gymnasial 
graduates and college sophomores. 
[ 248 ]
-P-A-G-E-261
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
It is not unreasonable to suppose that the somewhat 
shorter period of general education in these European 
systems, even after allowances are made, as has been 
done for retardation, is in part attributable to econo- 
mies resulting from their longer periods of secondary 
education. As has been stated, our organization cuts 
across the period of German and French secondary 
education at two points. To distribute the work of 
this period to three distinct units, as we do, is to invite 
wasteful duplication, and this must result in a longer 
period of years to cover the same ground or the cover- 
ing of less ground in a given period. It seems prob- 
able, therefore, that should we effect reorganization 
by introducing the junior-college years as an upward 
extension of our secondary school, we should be taking 
steps simultaneously toward shortening the typical 
period of general education and toward making room 
for an enlarged and enriched content during the same 
period, or in both these directions at once. 
IX. Arms or THE SECONDARY SCHOOL, THE COLLEGE, 
AND THE UNIVERSITY 
Reason for and nature of the canvass of aims and 
functions. It is not impossible that the reader, as he 
has surveyed the results of the forces of reorgani- 
zation in higher education presented in all but the last 
of the foregoing sections of the chapter, has from time 
[ 249 ] 
   
-P-A-G-E-262
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
to time wondered to what extent these momentous 
changes are paralleled in the best thought of the day. 
It was speculation such as this that prompted the mak- 
ing of the canvass and comparison of the aims and 
functions of the secondary school, the college, and the 
university. 
The materials used were, with few exceptions, ad- 
dresses, articles, or parts of volumes dealing to a 
greater or less extent with the purposes of the educa- 
tional units under consideration. With few exceptions, 
again, these writings are from the pens of leaders in 
their respective fields and made their appearance in 
recent years (that is, since 1910). Since the method of 
analysis and tabulation was very similar to that given 
in Chapter II, which deals with the current concep- 
tions of special purposes of the junior college, its de- 
scription will not be detailed again here. 
General impressions from the comparison. The first 
brief glance at Fig. 35, which shows the compari- 
son of the results, yields the general impression that 
there is a much greater approach to unanimity in the 
conceptions of purposes for high schools than for either 
of the other two units concerned. ‘This impression is 
given by the more frequent appearance of the heavier 
shadings in the secondary-school column. The sec- 
ond general impression is that secondary-school and 
college aims have much more in common than do col- 
lege and university aims. This impression is given by 
[250]
-P-A-G-E-263
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
shading for the same purposes in the secondary-school 
and college columns. Thus, for only two purposes 
recognized in the former column is there no recogni- 
tion in the latter, and, vice versa, for only two pur- 
poses in the latter is there no recognition in the former. 
Otherwise there is common recognition of aims in both 
columns, although, of course, not often to the same 
extent. 
On the other hand, there are ten purposes recog- 
nized in the college column which are unrecognized 
among university purposes. So striking is this differ- 
ence that one gains a rather distinct impression of dis- 
continuity between the college and university columns. 
This impression is emphasized by the recognition 
on behalf of the university (in the lowest portions of 
the figure) of four purposes unmentioned by those 
positing the aims of secondary schools and colleges. 
The similarity of secondary-school and college aims 
and the dissimilarity of these and university aims may 
be shown in another way; namely, by saying that 
of the sixteen purposes at all frequently recognized 
(that is, by more than 20 per cent of the authors) in 
the secondary-school column, fifteen are found to be 
recognized in the college column and only five in 
the university column. Conversely, of the seven aims 
receiving frequent recognition in the university col- 
umn, only three are recognized in the secondary-school 
and college columns. 
[251]
-P-A-G-E-264
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Specific similarities and differences. With certain 
exceptions these general impressions are further sup- 
ported by a comparison of recognition of each purpose 
listed. While the authors of the statements concern- 
ing secondary schools and colleges rather commonly 
contend that a chief aim of these schools is general or 
liberal training (aim 1), those proposing the purposes 
of the university posit it with only half the collegiate 
frequency. The author of no university statement 
proposes training for the general needs of life (2). 
The purposes touching civic-social responsibility (3), 
morality and character (4), religion (5), and domestic 
responsibility (6) either do not appear or scarcely 
appear in the statements of purposes of the university, 
although they are all proposed to a greater or less 
extent for the two lower schools. In the university 
statements the differences seem to reflect an assump- 
tion of previous performance of the purposes proposed 
for the college: they are prior aims and functions, not 
often to be regarded as concomitant. The same may 
be said of training for the proper use of leisure (8) ; 
physical efficiency (10) ; the achievement of a demo- 
cratic school system (13); the recognition of indi- 
vidual differences (14); preliminary training (17), 
which comprehends college preparation in the high 
school and preprofessional training in the college ; and 
training in the fundamental processes (19); except 
that for a larger proportion of these than of the fore-

going group the recognition for colleges of liberal 
arts is slighter than for secondary schools. 
Exceptions to this general tendency are to be found 
in purposes 7, 9, 11,12, 15, 16, and 21. Of these the 
last two are infrequently proposed for any of the three 
institutions. Despite the apparent equality of recog- 
nition of training for leadership (7) for the college 
and for the university, the kind of recognition differs 
widely for the two units. For the college the leader- 
ship contemplated is of a general civic or social type ; 
for the university it is always the leadership of the 
specialist, a fact apparent in the original statements 
only. Purpose 9 presents a somewhat anomalous sit- 
uation. It appears that recognition of occupational 
interests is very commonly proposed for both the sec- 
ondary school and the university, but not nearly as 
frequently for the college. The high school is urged 
to give training for vocations; the university, for pro- 
fessions; but only about a fourth of those proposing 
the college aims insist that this unit be concerned 
with either. Exploration and guidance (15) persists 
throughout, but is appropriately more characteristic 
of the secondary school than of the collegiate and 
university concepts of purpose. There is a growing 
conviction that guidance is primarily the function of 
the secondary-school period when this is understood 
to cover the full period of secondary education from 
the seventh grade through the fourteenth. 
[254]
-P-A-G-E-267
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
Research, instruction (as handmaiden to research 
and professional training), extension, and publica- 
tion (24, 25, 26, 27) are proposed for the university 
only. 
Summary. The findings of the comparison may be 
epitomized as follows: If the statements of the aims 
of the three units are to be accepted, those of the sec- 
ondary school and of the college have much more in 
common than have those of the college and the uni- 
versity. In fact, if a clear line of demarcation in 
function among the institutions were to be made on 
the basis of these statements of leaders in their respec- 
tive fields, it would fall much more naturally at the 
close of the college period than at its beginning. If 
the training appropriate for the two lower units fol- 
lowed the lines recommended in the present analysis, 
it would be general or liberal and would for the most 
part be constituted of those elements necessary for all 
irrespective of the line of specialization. Training for 
the professions and other advanced specializations 
would be delayed to the university period, although 
elementary specializations such as the “vocations” 
would be provided in the lowest of the three units. In 
addition to providing opportunities for professional 
training, the university would foster research, would 
offer advanced instruction as handmaiden to research 
and professional training, would carry on extension 
activities, and would be an agency of publication. 
[255] 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Beyond these findings it appears that the friends of 
the college whose statements have been used in this 
study are generally far from agreement on what should 
be the purposes of that institution—much less so than 
the secondary-school group and somewhat less so than 
those speaking for the university. The approximation 
to unanimity of the secondary-school group has been 
noted. If the statements of leaders in this field are at 
all prophetic, the high schools of the country will soon 
have common aims. The larger number of blank spaces 
in the university column indicates a somewhat nearer 
approach to unanimity for this institution than for 
the college. The extent of agreement would have been 
even greater if some of those proposing aims for the 
university unit were not thinking primarily in terms 
of the college of liberal arts in aspiring but unde- 
veloped universities. The college has much farther to 
go than its sister institutions before it finds its real and 
generally accepted functions. In this respect it is the 
most nondescript unit in our system of education, 
which should be a matter of grave concern to its 
friends, especially as it is the oldest of the units in the 
American system. 
Role of the junior college in clarifying college aims. 
In this situation, as may be judged not only from what 
has been reported in this section but also in all the 
preceding sections of this chapter, the more general 
acceptance of the junior college and the adaptation of 
[ 256] 
 
-P-A-G-E-269
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
the older units to it would make for a pronounced 
elimination of the nondescript character of college 
purposes and an allocation of purpose that would be 
certain to bring order out of the current chaos and 
interference of function in higher education. 
With the acknowledged period of secondary educa- 
tion extended to include two more years and our line 
of demarcation placed neither at the beginning nor at 
the termination of our present period of collegiate 
education but at its mid-point instead, allocation of 
purpose to each unit and differentiation among them 
should take care of themselves with something of 
automaticity. Most of the aims and functions found 
to be largely recognized in the secondary-school group 
would at once rise to the new level and give to the first 
two years of what is now college work a new and real 
significance. If these two years were made terminal 
grades in an extended period of secondary education, 
thought with reference to them would move toward 
clarification, and practice would become functional. 
With this elevation of secondary-school aims would 
come the partial recognition in junior-college years of 
the occupational aim now almost denied entrance in 
corresponding years of the four-year college, a recog- 
nition that would foster the location of the semiprofes- 
sions referred to in Chapter V. At the same time the 
purposes held to be appropriate for the period of uni- 
versity education would naturally apply to the last 
[257]
-P-A-G-E-270
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
two years of college—the proper point for the begin- 
ning of specialization for one’s professional destina- 
tion and for the type of training appropriate to that 
period of life at which the student has ordinarily 
arrived by the time he is a college junior. 
This readjustment has the advantage of being in 
full agreement with the results of the irresistible forces 
of reorganization which have been uncovered in the 
preceding parts of the chapter ; namely, the advancing 
age of the college entrant, the increasing extent of 
preparation required, the downward shift of the mate- 
rials of instruction, the changing organization of the 
college curriculum, the vocational bearing of the 
major, the occupational destination of college gradu- 
ates, and the accommodations which are in the nature 
of concessions to the demand for earlier professional- 
ization, not to mention others fully as significant. 
Abatement of the college-entrance controversy. 
Finally, the two-year upward extension of the period 
of secondary education which the acceptance of the 
junior-college plan implies, bringing with it the com- 
pletion of the student’s general education before his 
advance to the higher institution, should go far toward 
removing from the region of controversy the problem 
of college preparation. Probably nothing can ever put 
an end fully to the disagreement on this question be- 
tween the representatives of the lower and of the 
[258 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
higher schools, but some abatement is much to be de- 
sired. It will hardly come while the two institutions 
concerned overlap on each other’s functions as much 
as do the high schools on the one hand and the colleges 
and universities on the other. As long as both bear 
the responsibilities of general education the authori- 
ties representing each will feel that they are in a 
position to know and to determine wisely what shall 
constitute that general training, and herein lies peren- 
nial conflict. 
Given an organization of education which acknowl- 
edges that professional or academic specialization is 
to begin at the opening of the junior year, and we 
change the question of college preparation from what 
is necessary for a continuation of general education 
to what is an essential foundation for a course of 
training in a specialty. The requirements in the way 
of preliminary training for professional or other special 
curricula are much more unequivocally definable than 
those for a mere extension of general training to higher 
levels. The same may be said of mental capacities 
and other personal equipment desirable. Although 
putting an end to controversy is not the highest form 
of function to be performed by an educational insti- 
tution, such an achievement is doubly welcome when 
it is an accompaniment of a differentiation of purpose 
of institutions that is itself logical and commendable.

X. CONCURRENCE OF THE TENDENCIES TOWARD RE- 
ORGANIZATION AND THEIR MEANING FOR HIGHER 
SCHOOLS OF THE FUTURE 
Concurrence of tendencies. Among the most out- 
standing characteristics of the tendencies toward 
reorganization which have been disclosed in this chap- 
ter is their large degree of concurrence. Practically 
without exception they show the same general trend, 
indicating that, whatever the forces, these tendencies 
are all of a piece. The facts presented are to be re- 
garded as links in essentially a single chain of evidence 
foreshadowing inevitable and ultimate reorganization 
which involves the acknowledgment of (1) the first 
two collegiate years as the typical termination of the 
period of general and secondary education for those 
who contemplate going on to higher levels and (2) 
the beginning of higher education proper somewhere 
in the vicinity of the present junior collegiate year. 
Future organization of higher education. Some of 
our higher institutions (among them both colleges 
and universities), on account of the grip of tradition 
and a selected, persisting clientele, will doubtless be 
able to withstand for a long period the forces of 
reorganization to which attention has been directed. 
It is not unlikely, moreover, that there may be a place 
in the American system for a small proportion of in- 
stitutions of the type that assumes the longer period 
[ 260 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  
THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
of nonoccupational training before entering upon the 
work of the professional school. But in the face of the 
apparently inevitable tendencies of reorganization as 
disclosed, the consummation of the new type, bring- 
ing with it the upward extension of the secondary 
school by the inclusion of the junior-college years, 
will go far toward justifying those claims of the friends 
of the new unit who insist that it will place in the 
secondary school all work appropriate to it, foster 
the evolution of the public-school system, relieve the 
university, and make possible real university func- 
tioning. As pointed out in the concluding paragraphs 
of the preceding section, it will at the same time abate 
in considerable measure the present-day college- 
entrance controversy, which is the more acute because 
at present both secondary and higher institutions 
presume to give general training. For the current 
confusion will be substituted the clarifying influence 
of more unequivocally definable preparatory require- 
ments of professional and other specializations. 
The future of the university and other higher in- 
stitutions of polytechnic type in this impending re- 
organization is much more clearly discernible than 
is that of its sister institutions—the separate four- 
year college and the normal school or teachers’ col- 
lege. Concerning these it is doubtless too early to 
essay prophecy that will approach realization in any 
significant degree, but at least some conjecture can 
[ 261 ]  
-P-A-G-E-274
  
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
be ventured. It is admitted that a small propor- 
tion of the separate colleges, especially those with a 
ballast of endowment and a host of well-to-do and 
tradition-loving alumni, may be able to withstand 
the inevitable trend and remain institutions which 
afford unspecialized training throughout a four-year 
period. Most of them, however, must make further 
accommodations to the trend, serving their genera- 
tion in the way in which it insists upon being served. 
For the weaker units this will be as junior colleges 
that will draw their students from secondary schools 
in communities too small to warrant offering work 
on the junior-college level. In time, however, these 
junior colleges must go the way of the private acad- 
emy in territory where the public high schools have 
seen a vigorous development. The remainder, in a bet- 
ter state of development than those just referred to, 
can for the most part serve in the dual capacity of 
(1) junior colleges and (2) senior colleges in which 
certain types of liberalized occupationalization and 
specialization are featured. Few such institutions will 
be able to compete with universities in the variety of 
opportunities for specialization, but they can devote 
their energies and resources to one or a few subjects 
—teaching, commerce, home economics, and the like. 
In the remoter future the junior-college division will 
atrophy, and these colleges will then devote them- 
selves exclusively to the senior-college task.

THE TREND OF REORGANIZATION 
If the future form and function of the separate 
college is problematic, that of the normal school or 
teachers’ college is even more so. Perhaps, until stand- 
ards of teacher preparation rise to appropriate heights, 
the normal school will recruit most of its students 
from communities too small to warrant offering junior- 
college work, as has just been predicted for the private 
junior college, and from among those who desire this 
type of semiprofessional training. As these standards 
are raised it is conceivable that the teachers’ college 
with a four-year or five-year curriculum will come to 
articulate with the public junior college so as to en- 
courage the prospective student to attend the latter 
for two years beyond the present high-school level and 
to transfer to the teacher-training institution at the 
opening of his third college year. It seems reasonable 
to expect that the general establishment of junior col- 
leges will hasten the elevation of standards of teacher 
preparation to the strictly professional level. 
Although we may question the validity of this 
prophecy of the future of the two types of institution 
last considered, one thing is certain, that the advent 
of reorganization of the secondary school and the 
university along lines involving the incorporation of 
the junior-college plan will be reflected in them, for 
the reason that they must adapt themselves to what 
is to become the dominant contemporaneous organ- 
ization of the educational system.

OVERLAPPING IN HIGH SCHOOL AND 
COLLEGE 
I. THE PropLeM IN GENERAL AND THE 
APPROACH IN CANVASSING IT 
The problem. As may be inferred from the intro- 
ductory paragraphs of Chapter VII, at least two 
conceptions of the special purposes of the junior 
college frequently proposed imply a large extent of 
overlapping of work in high school and college. These 
are the claims which anticipate that the general es- 
tablishment of the junior college will place in the 
secondary school all work appropriate to it and will 
assist in economizing time and expense by avoiding 
duplication (Chapter II, purposes 10 and 13). These 
beliefs are entertained by no inconsiderable propor- 
tion of those whose statements were included. 
Something of the better type of thinking which 
characterizes the belief that the college is doing much 
work of secondary-school grade is illustrated in the 
following quotation,’ although the excerpt is drawn 
1J. R. Angell, “The Duplication of School Work by the College,” in 
School Review, Vol. XXI, pp. 1-10 (January, 1913).

OVERLAPPING 
from a paper that was not used in the analysis of 
claims presented in Chapter IT and is one without 
expressed intent of presenting any part of a case for 
the junior-college movement : 
The wealth of subject matter offered in a high-school 
curriculum today often hopelessly outruns any possibility 
of mastery by a given pupil within a four-year period, and 
much therefore remains untouched which the student may 
possibly wish to attack at a later point in his career. The 
college has been willing in increasing degree to satisfy this 
demand, and as a result we find a wide range of identical 
subjects taught in school and college. The mere fact that 
the two varieties of institution offer the same work is not 
itself conclusive evidence of waste, but a careful study of 
the situation leads one to question whether the present 
practice is really defensible in all its aspects. . . . 
. . we may well remember that our colleges pursue 
two lines in their practice with regard to the school work 
which they duplicate. In the one case they do the seem- 
ingly obvious thing, and after a student has covered cer- 
tain ground in school he is permitted to proceed in college 
to the next more advanced stage of the same subject. 
Work in the modern languages may illustrate this case. 
But in the second instance, where the colleges offer work 
which is nominally identical with that done in the schools 
and entrance credit is given for the same, the student, 
when once he is safely inside the college walls, finds himself 
set to doing right over again much which he has already 
done in school. This procedure is frequently justified on 
the ground that the work is carried on in college from a 
[265 ]

THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
more mature and advanced point of view. Certain courses 
in science both physical and biological may illustrate this 
case. ... 
The only emendation one is moved to make in this 
description of duplication is that in many instances 
also secondary-school subjects are begun in the col- 
lege. Cases in point are beginning courses in modern 
foreign language. 
The plan of this chapter. The issues here con- 
cerned are of such a magnitude as to prompt the in- 
clusion in this volume of some of the findings of an 
extended inquiry into the degree of overlapping in 
high-school and college work from the two stand- 
points of duplication of identical or similar curricular 
materials irrespective of repetition by an individual 
student and of duplication which is in the nature of 
such repetition. More specifically, this chapter will 
concern itself with (1) illustration of the extent and 
character of overlapping in the two fields of English 
literature and chemistry, (2) conclusions drawn from 
studies made of overlapping in other typical subjects, 
(3) a brief summary of such efforts as are made by 
colleges to obviate repetition, and (4) consideration 
of the extent of overlapping of high-school work in 
the first two years of college work as a whole. The 
chapter will close with a consideration of the signifi- 
cance of the extent of overlapping disclosed.

  OVERLAPPING 
II. OvERLAPPING IN ENGLISH LITERATURE 
The courses compared. The first of the comparisons 
the findings of which are here illustrated concerns 
those portions of the high-school offering in English 
devoted to the history of English literature and the 
course bearing that name (or names closely allied 
to it; for example, “survey course in English litera- 
ture”) as administered in colleges. The high-school 
material is not always presented as a separate course, 
but it is nevertheless a standard constituent of work 
in English in the lower unit. The historical portions 
of the high-school work in English literature most 
frequently come in the senior year, but are also to 
be found in the junior year in some of the institutions 
represented. In colleges the course is usually an offer- 
ing to under-classmen. It is therefore almost always 
taken late in high school and early in college; that is 
to say, by students not often more than a year apart in 
classification. 
The work here described is going forward in ran- 
domly selected institutions located for the most part 
in states of the Mid-West. The high schools repre- 
sented are all in cities with populations in excess 
of seventy-five hundred, and the colleges are all on 
standard lists. 
Textbooks. The two chief aspects of the content 
of the courses concerned are reading about English 
[ 267 ]  
-P-A-G-E-280
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
literature, usually in textbooks, and the reading of 
the literature itself. As all but a few of the high 
schools and almost three fifths of the colleges repre- 
sented prescribe the study of a textbook in connection 
with the first aspect, a text from which only occa- 
sional omissions are made, it is pertinent to compare 
the courses by comparing the results of an analysis 
of the texts most frequently used. In the high 
school these were Halleck and Long; in the college, 
Moody-Lovett and Crawshaw. The medians of the 
amounts of textual content reported for both groups 
of courses are almost equal, being 549.4 pages for the 
high school and 535.3 for the college. These textual 
materials represent the following percentages of the 
courses: 29.3 for the high schools and 17.2 for the col- 
leges. The high schools show some tendency to make 
more of this aspect than do the colleges, although the 
difference is not remarkable. 
Division of the texts as to portions assigned to 
major and to minor writers shows in the college 
manuals a somewhat larger average percentage deal- 
ing with minor writers. The actual average difference 
between the two pairs of texts is that between a 
fourth and a third of the whole. The difference in 
this respect is really less notable than is the degree 
of similarity. Special inquiry was made on another 
point on which it was suspected that there might be 
a qualitative difference—the distribution of textual 
[ 268 ]
-P-A-G-E-281
  
  OVERLAPPING 
content between more strictly personal biography on 
the one hand and on the other the treatment of lit- 
erary biography and works. Here again there is a 
tendency to larger proportions of the latter in the col- 
lege texts, but the difference is at the same time not 
marked enough to disturb the conclusion of much 
more of identity than of distinctiveness in textual 
content. 
A more nearly adequate comparison of the nature 
of the textual content is provided in a distribution to 
six major divisions—environmental influences, writ- 
ings, biography, extracts, general considerations 
(usually introductory), and mechanical details (bib- 
liographies, illustrations, etc.). The high-school texts 
devote proportions noticeably larger to biography, 
extracts, general considerations, and mechanical de- 
tails, the college texts to the first two topics named. 
Once more, however, the distributions are not suffi- 
ciently different to warrant a conclusion of marked 
distinctiveness of textual content in the courses on 
the two levels. 
Overlapping in the literature. The analysis of the 
other chief constituent of these courses in English 
literature in high school. and college concerns the 
selections read. For the lower unit this includes all 
the classics (exclusive of those in the American field) 
read during the entire high-school course in English, 
extending through three or four years, and this com-

One of the measures of overlapping was drawn

OVERLAPPING 
with which each selection listed by all the institu- 
tions was read in each of the two groups, twenty- 
four high schools and twenty-four colleges. A total 
of 1792 different selections were reported by the forty- 
eight heads of departments. Of these, 546 only were 
not read in one or more of the high schools repre- 
sented. Of the total of 1246 which were read in one 
or more high schools 118 were read in a half or more. 
Of the 118 selections 72 were read also in a half or 
more of the colleges, 35 with less frequency. Eleven 
only of this list of 118 were to be found in no college 
list. Another way of directing attention to the large 
extent of overlapping and apparent lack of distinctive- 
ness of content for the courses on the two levels is to 
say that 575 selections, or 46.2 per cent, of all found in 
the high-school lists were also found in the college 
lists and that 575, or 51.3 per cent, of all the selec- 
tions found in the college lists were also in the high- 
school lists. 
The following is the list of seventy-two selections 
common to a half or more of both high-school and 
college lists. All seem to be gems held in such high 
esteem that few instructors on either level appear 
willing to leave them out of account.

OVERLAPPING 
Other measures of the extent of overlapping of 
literary content of the courses on the two levels were 
essayed, but probably as significant as any other is 
one which takes into account both the length of the 
selections and their frequency of appearance in the 
lists; that is, that weights the overlapping in terms 
of length and frequency. Computed in this way, the 
total number of equated pages read in twenty-four 
high schools was 119,848.4, of which the twenty-four 
colleges duplicated 42,344.9, or 35.3 percent. This is 
an actual duplication in these college courses of well 
over a third of everything read in the high school. 
Significance of the extent of overlapping found. 
A few additional aspects of the comparison of the two 
groups of offerings showed both differences and sim- 
ilarities. Examples of the differences are larger total 
reading requirements and larger numbers of pages of 
reading per clock-hour of class instruction in the col- 
lege. These quantitative differences are not, however, 
far enough apart to make it impossible to achieve 
essentially the same ends on both levels on which 
they are given, especially as requirements in some 
high schools exceed those in some colleges. No evi- 
dence appeared to shake the conclusion of an unde- 
sirably large proportion of actual repetition for any 
group of students. 
The findings of the study constitute a compelling 
argument for modifying the college courses and the 
[273 ]
-P-A-G-E-286
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
high-school offerings in this field so that greater total 
progress can be achieved in the time spent by the 
student. They demonstrate unmistakably our error 
in distributing the task of giving this elementary in- 
struction in English literature to two institutions, the 
authorities and instructors in the upper of which do 
not seem to be aware of what is going forward in 
the lower. Even if it is admitted that it is desirable 
for students to make more than a single contact with 
many of these selections during their school careers, 
there can be no point in having this accomplished un- 
der conditions which do not assure a different type of 
approach on each occasion. It may well be doubted 
whether this regrettable waste can ever be eliminated 
in the present organization of secondary and higher 
education, although steps should be taken in this direc- 
tion without delay no matter what the arrangement of 
the system of schools. The logical step seems to be to 
bring the work together in the same institution where 
the duplication and repetition will more readily be- 
come apparent and be more promptly obviated. This 
means the establishment of junior-college work in 
connection with the high-school unit. This step is the 
more to be recommended by the outstanding fact of 
the similarity of the curricular materials concerned— 
a fact which marks those found in the upper unit as 
essentially secondary in character.

III. OvERLAPPING IN CHEMISTRY 
The courses compared. The high-school courses 
in the field here reported upon bear such names as 
“chemistry,” “elementary chemistry,” “general chem- 
istry,” and “beginning chemistry,” with a scattering 
of other titles. The college courses bear the names 
“general inorganic chemistry,” “general chemistry,” 
“Chemistry I and II,” and “elementary chemistry,” 
the last two titles appearing much less frequently than 
the first two. 
Almost all the courses represented in both the high 
school and the college extend over a full school year. 
The numbers of recitation and laboratory periods per 
week tend to be identical in the two institutions, the 
difference in the total amount of time given to the 
courses arising from the longer periods in college. 
The data on the classification of students who take 
the high-school course corroborate those of other in- 
vestigations, showing that it is predominantly pursued 
by seniors, although it is also often taken by juniors. 
Students in these first college courses are mainly fresh- 
men, although they are to some extent sophomores. 
We have here an instance of a subject taken predom- 
inantly by those in the last year of the lower unit 
and in the first year of the upper unit. This situa- 
tion, combined with the approach to identity in the 
[275]
-P-A-G-E-288
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
titles and duration of the courses, presages a large 
measure of identity of content. 
The high schools represented are twenty-six in 
number and are distributed to cities of ten thousand 
and over in six north-central states. The forty-one 
higher institutions, of which all but four are of the 
separate college type, are located in the same general 
region as the high schools, but are scattered over 
eleven different states. 
Content of high-school and college texts. The chief 
feature of the method of comparing the content of 
high-school and college courses in this subject is that 
of comparing the textbooks and laboratory manuals 
the use of which was reported by the heads of depart- 
ments. This procedure has its justification in the fact 
that deviations from such materials are not at all 
commonly made; that is to say, the textbook and 
the laboratory manual usually constitute the course. 
That the analysis of the textbooks almost adequately 
represents the classroom content of the courses may 
be judged from what was ascertained touching the 
extent of omissions from them and from the infre- 
quent recourse to collateral readings. Special inquiry 
on the former point brought the conclusion that nine- 
teen of the twenty-six high-school courses made no 
omissions from the textbooks used, or practically none, 
the remainder excluding only a part or all of the 
organic chemistry. The situation, in so far as it con- 
[ 276 ]
-P-A-G-E-289
  OVERLAPPING 
cerns college courses, is even more than in the high 
school one of textbook domination. 
The two larger headings under which the content 
has been divided are (1) the common elements and 
(2) subdivisions other than common elements. The 
former content is again distributed to occurrence, 
preparation, physical properties, chemical properties, 
history, uses, and the preparation, description, and 
uses of compounds; the latter content to the rarer 
elements, organic compounds, processes, principles, 
chemical laws, definitions, questions, problems, and 
summaries and restatements. 
From what is generally known about the total 
amount of content in the two groups of textbooks it 
would not have been difficult to predict that the col- 
lege texts would have more material in many of the 
subdivisions which high-school and college courses 
have incommon. This prediction is borne out by the 
facts as to the averages in the two college and three 
high-school texts in most common use, since in all but 
four out of the eighteen subdivisions the average col- 
lege amounts exceed the high-school amounts. The 
exceptions are the uses of the common elements, or- 
ganic compounds, questions, and summaries and re- 
statements. The second of the exceptions is to be 
explained by the fact that the college courses are more 
often designated as general inorganic chemistry than 
are the high-school courses, which aim to be even more 
[277]

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
general in character. The third and fourth exceptions 
are explicable through the greater emphasis upon 
pedagogical devices in the texts used in the lower unit.

The percentage distributions tend to emphasize 
the similarity more than do the data setting forth the 
actual space assignments in numbers of equated lines. 
The notable differences in favor of the college are 
reduced to four: preparation of compounds, proper- 
ties of compounds, the rarer elements, and principles. 
On the other hand, one subdivision, the uses of com- 
pounds, is added to those in which high-school texts 
have an excess; for others the excess appearing in the 
first pair of figures is accentuated. 
As far as can be concluded from the analysis of 
texts, it may be said that although college texts are 
more extended than high-school texts, the relative 
recognition of the several subdivisions does not differ 
widely, except that college texts stress compounds 
(especially their preparation and properties), the rarer 
elements, and principles more than do high-school 
texts, whereas the latter make more of uses (both of 
elements and compounds), organic materials, and ped- 
agogical features such as questions and summaries. 
Furthermore, the similarities far exceed the differences. 
It will be pertinent here to illustrate the nature of 
some of the differences found. The chief difference 
in favor of the college texts under the main head of 
common elements appears in the subdivisions dealing 
with compounds. For instance, the mean number of 
compounds of sulphur mentioned in college texts is 21 ; 
in high-school texts, 9.6. For nitrogen the means

If processes, principles, laws, and definitions are 
assumed to comprehend the more theoretical portions 
of the course in chemistry and are therefore consid- 
ered for the time being as a whole, and if the average 
percentages of total content in these four groups are 
computed for college and high-school texts respec- 
tively, the percentages are found to be 41.33 and 
37-34. The theoretical portions of the college texts 
can thus be said to exceed those of high-school texts 
by 4 per cent—an appreciable but hardly extraordi- 
nary difference. 
A comparison of illustrations. Corroboratory tes- 
timony of some value on the extent of the similarity 
and difference of high-school and college texts is 
yielded by a comparative study of the illustrations 
to be found in them. The average number in the two 
groups of texts is almost identical, being 159 for the 
college and 164 for the high school. If the extent of 
the overlapping of the illustrations in the two groups 
of texts is computed, the procedure in computation 
assuming identity if the illustrations portray similar 
apparatus and are used to convey the same principle 
or idea, it is found to include roughly three fifths and 
two thirds of those appearing, respectively, in the 
college and high-school texts. 
Overlapping in laboratory manuals. A count of the

alyzed results in a total of 99. Of these the two 
college manuals have 79 and 85, or a mean of 82. 
The mean for the three high-school manuals is 752, 
or only 64 less than the college average. This count 
of the large’ experiment heads does not, however, do 
full justice to the difference in extent of laboratory 
activity provided for, a difference which is somewhat 
accentuated when the comparison includes a consider- 
ation of sub-experiments (or parts of experiments). 
Data on this point, space for the presentation of which 
cannot be spared, give ground for the belief that 
although there is much overlapping in the larger fea- 
tures and content of the experiments introduced, the 
more extended detail in the college manuals means a 
more thoroughgoing experimental exploration of the 
fields represented. 
Reverting to the overlapping computed in terms of 
space assigned to the large experiment heads, let it be 
said that the average percentages of overlapping turn 
out to be 72.59 for college experiments and 67.69 for 
high-school experiments. If to these amounts and 
percentages are added those of experiments found in 
both groups but not in each text of both groups, the 
totals mount to almost all the exercises, roughly 99 
and 95 per cent, respectively, for the two groups of 
manuals. This leaves only about 1 per cent and 5 per 
cent, respectively, peculiar to college and high-school 
manuals. The larger per cent of materials distinctive 
[ 284 ]
-P-A-G-E-297
OVERLAPPING 
of the high-school manuals arises out of the desire to 
emphasize the “practical” in the experiments, as well 
as to make the course more general by introducing 
simple experiments in the organic field. Even when 
any conclusion drawn is qualified by the fact of the 
larger number of sub-experiments introduced into the 
college manuals, it must be admitted that the labora- 
tory portions of college and high-school courses in 
chemistry resemble each other vastly more than they 
differ. 
Quantitative differences between high-school and 
college requirements. Some of the facts in the de- 
scription of high-school and college courses in chemis- 
try already cited point to appreciable and, in some 
instances, even notable quantitative distinctions. The 
average numbers of equated lines in the textbooks are 
respectively 15,875 and 27,343. The average number 
of topics per high-school text (the term “topic” re- 
ferring to each common element, each rarer element, 
each “process,” and so on) is 261.3 and per college 
text, 306.5; the average numbers of lines per topic 
are respectively 60.7 and 90.0. The median numbers 
of pages of text assigned per clock-hour of recitation 
or lecture are 7.9 and 9.2, showing a difference less 
marked than may be anticipated from the measures 
of gross content just presented. The reduction is 
accounted for by the considerably larger number of 
clock-hours of instruction in the college courses.

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Conclusion. It is clear from the comparisons made 
that although there are some differences between high- 
school and first college courses in chemistry, they are 
much alike. Consequently, if the materials presented 
in high-school courses may be presumed to be sec- 
ondary in character, there is relatively little in these 
first college courses which is not purely secondary. 
Moreover, if a student takes the course in general in- 
organic chemistry in college after having had the high- 
school course (which is often done), he is repeating 
almost all of it. Even in that relatively small propor- 
tion of higher institutions where such a student enters 
upon a course in general inorganic chemistry presumed 
to be administered for those who offered the high- 
school unit for admission, there must be a large 
amount of repetition. 
The conclusions with reference to the proper means 
of effecting a reorganization of courses that will guar- 
antee proper progress and obviate wasteful repetition 
must be identical with that presented in the section 
immediately preceding, which deals with overlapping 
in English literature: it must be through a regrouping 
of the years of school work that shall bring the present 
later high-school and earlier college years into inti- 
mate association. This is accomplished through the 
establishment of junior colleges.

IV. OvERLAPPING IN OTHER SUBJECTS AND CouRSES 
Quantitative differences. The findings of extended 
investigations in five other fields—English composi- 
tion, elementary French, algebra, American history, 
and economics—will be much more briefly epitomized 
than were those for English literature and chemistry. 
While the materials are no less pregnant with signifi- 
cance and hardly less striking as concerns the extent 
of overlapping, the trend of conclusions is very much 
in the same general direction, and this fact makes it 
possible to resort to an even briefer summary of 
tendencies. 
In quantitative ways the high-school and college 
offerings in the five fields named differ, for the most 
part, in the same degree as do those in the two already 
dealt with. The total textual content for the median 
case in courses in “freshman rhetoric” exceeds by 
approximately a third that in all the composition por- 
tion of the full high-school course in English extending 
through three or four years, although the median num- 
ber of clock-hours of instruction is almost twice as 
large in the latter. This means that the textual con- 
tent in pages per clock-hour is considerably larger for 
the course on the upper level. The theme require- 
ments of the college courses, when measured by the 
number of words per clock-hour of class time, are also 
about twice as large if the median here is compared 
[ 287 ]  
-P-A-G-E-300
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
with that for all four years of high school. There is 
not as great a difference when the college median is 
compared with that for the fourth high-school year, 
since, as is to be expected, requirements per clock- 
hour increase rather consistently as the student pro- 
gresses from his freshman year to his senior year in 
the lower unit. The total textual and reading content 
and the number of pages per clock-hour of instruction 
in elementary French covered in college courses ex- 
ceed those in high-school courses, although the differ- 
ence is not so large as is assumed in admitting students 
to intermediate and advanced college courses. Com- 
parison in quantitative ways is more difficult for alge- 
bra; but it may be said that in amount of theory the 
courses in college algebra exceed those in “higher” 
or “advanced” algebra as given in the high school, 
whereas in the gross number of exercises and verbal 
problems the high-school courses lead. Similarly, in 
both textual and collateral-reading content college 
courses in American history and economics far outstrip 
the high-school courses, some of which, however, ex- 
ceed in these respects some college courses. What is 
referred to here is the trend of difference, which is 
clearly in favor of the courses in the upper unit. 
Comparisons as to the nature of the content. An- 
alysis of textual content of work in English composi- 
tion in the high school and freshman rhetoric in the 
college discovers both similarities and differences. 
[ 288 ]
-P-A-G-E-301
  
OVERLAPPING 
Distributed to large groups, such as mechanics (gram- 
mar, punctuation, spelling, and pronunciation), dic- 
tion, structure, forms of discourse, models, literary 
forms, and miscellaneous, the high-school courses 
show tendencies to large excesses over the college 
courses in the first, third, and fourth, whereas the col- 
lege courses show a tendency to excesses only in the 
proportion devoted to models. If the constituent last 
named is omitted and recomputations of percentages 
for the remaining groups are made, the differences are 
less marked, but the portions devoted to diction and 
miscellaneous in the college courses notably exceed 
those in the high-school courses. The general conclu- 
sion is one of something of distinctiveness, but with 
much of similarity and even of identity. 
This conclusion is much more nearly unequivocal 
for courses in elementary French, where the first two 
years of work in the high school were compared with 
the first year of work in the college. The chief differ- 
ence is in the larger proportion of grammatical content 
in the college courses and the larger proportions of 
reading in the high-school courses. In other respects 
the content is more nearly alike than different, a find- 
ing corroborated by the common use in many instances 
of the same texts and readings. 
Courses in higher algebra and college algebra are 
also both alike and different. Differentiation is shown, 
on the one hand, in the larger proportions of higher 
[ 289 ]
-P-A-G-E-302
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
algebra devoted to more elementary topics, such as 
factoring, linear equations, radicals, etc., and, on the 
other, in. the larger proportions of college algebra 
devoted to more advanced topics, such as permuta- 
tions, combinations, probability, and determinants. 
The large extent of overlapping is shown both in the 
generous list of topics, such as quadratic equations, 
irrational equations, progressions, and the binomial 
theorem, in which the courses on the two levels have 
proportions of the total content approximately equal, 
and in the overlapping in the distributions of percen- 
tages when all higher and college algebra courses are 
compared. 
In the majority of first college courses in American 
history, as in practically all high-school courses in the 
same field, the total period covered begins with dis- 
covery and ends with the present day. Moreover, if 
the textual content is distributed to nine periods, such 
as discovery and exploration, colonial development, 
colonial wars, pre-Revolutionary times, the Revolu- 
tion, etc., the average percentages of the total course 
assigned to each in high-school and college courses 
are almost equal. When again, after a careful topical 
analysis, this textual content is classified as political, 
economic, social, or military, the proportions are found 
to be almost equal, the only exception being a some- 
what larger percentage of the division last named in 
the average college course. 
[ 290 ]
-P-A-G-E-303
  OVERLAPPING 
The high-school courses in economics are likewise, 
more often than not, reduced replicas of the college 
courses. When the textual content of representative 
groups of courses is distributed to the seven divisions 
of production, value and exchange, money and the 
medium of exchange, international trade, distribution, 
labor problems, and taxation, the percentages found 
to be devoted to each in the high-school and college 
courses are nearly equal, the only exceptions being a 
larger percentage in production in the high-school 
courses and compensating differences in favor of 
distribution and labor problems in college courses. 
Undiscovered qualitative differences. It is to be 
conceded that although the methods of inquiry used 
are designed to discover some of the qualitative differ- 
ences between the courses on the two levels repre- 
sented, they have not found all. Nothing short of a 
comprehensive plan of measuring the results of the 
instruction given can meet the requirements of the 
situation. Among the factors certain to make for 
qualitative distinctions (at least as concerns results) 
are the larger extent of selection in the student-body 
of even the first years ef the college as compared with 
the last years of the present high-school period and 
the more extended training in subject matter of col- 
lege teachers. There are also other qualitative differ- 
ences in detail of content which are not discoverable 
by the methods used. 
[ 291 ]
-P-A-G-E-304
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Factors making for identity. But after all admis- 
sions of undiscovered distinctions have been made, the 
large extent of community of content remains as the 
salient feature of the curricular situation investigated. 
This conclusion of the large extent of identity is en- 
couraged, moreover, by other facts summarized in 
this and the preceding chapter. In the last chapter 
we learned that much, if not most, of what is now’ 
offered in the high school is a heritage from collegi- 
ate curricula; that subject after subject has been de- 
pressed, usually without dilution, from college years 
to high-school years. Since this depression was ac- 
complished by teachers trained in the colleges, it 
would have been surprising indeed if they did not 
transfer to the lower school, as nearly complete as 
possible, what had been in the work taken by them in 
their college careers. The same conclusion is antici- 
pated also by facts concerning the proximity of classi- 
fication of students taking the high-school courses 
examined, and the degree of similarity in the methods 
used, the latter being in turn anticipated by the negli- 
gible differences in the typical size of the class sections. 
For example, that part of the high-school course in 
English which is devoted to the survey of English 
literature is taken typically by seniors, whereas the 
college course is usually taken by freshmen and sopho- 
mores. The tendency to nearness of classification is 
characteristic of most of the courses scrutinized in this 
[ 292 ]
-P-A-G-E-305
OVERLAPPING 
chapter. The subjects which in part form exceptions 
to this generalization are English composition (cer- 
tain portions of which come in for emphasis during the 
lower high-school years only ), and first courses in high- 
school French, which are in some high schools more 
frequently taken by students in the ninth or tenth 
grade than by those in the eleventh grade. The first 
college courses in most of the subjects investigated are 
thus typically pursued either in the year immediately 
following that in which the corresponding course is pur- 
sued in the high school, or with but a single school year 
intervening. Much less frequently is there a wider gap 
of time between them. Under such circumstances it is 
not to be expected that the courses would differ widely. 
Another type of fact that points to similarity is the 
degree of similarity of methods. The chief difference 
here seems to be the more frequent use of the lecture 
method in the college courses, more especially in the 
survey course in English literature, in chemistry, and 
in American history. Even in these there is not as 
large a difference as traditional beliefs lead us to 
expect, the recitation mode being the typically pre- 
dominant one in the college courses as well as in the 
high-school courses. This similarity of procedure is 
made possible by a relatively small average excess in 
the size of class sections in college. 
The situation in courses and subjects not investi- 
gated in detail. Some comment will now be ventured 
[ 293]  
-P-A-G-E-306
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
on the degree of overlapping in fields and courses not 
subjected to such detailed analysis as was attempted 
for the materials on the subjects just summarized. On 
the basis of the earlier place of Greek and Latin in 
secondary-school programs there was relatively little 
overlapping of college upon high-school offerings in 
these languages. Beginning Greek has, however, be- 
come a course given almost exclusively in the college, 
and therefore we may say that although there is little 
in the way of repetition by the individual student, 
those who begin Greek are doing work of secondary- 
school character. Latin seems to be following its elder 
sister in this process of being relegated to the early 
college years, if we may judge by the appearance of 
elementary offerings in the college catalogues in the 
West and Middle West; and, to the extent that this is 
true, the same thing may be said of it as was just said 
of Greek. The situation as to Spanish is essentially 
the same as that for French; for German it differs only 
in the fact that instruction in this language is now 
practically nonexistent in high schools, elementary 
courses, like those in other modern foreign languages, 
being pursued in junior-college years. 
In so far as students pursue courses in solid geome- 
try and trigonometry in college they are doing work of 
secondary-school character, since solid geometry is 
typically given in the high school and trigonometry is 
often given. The courses in analytic geometry over- 
[294]
-P-A-G-E-307
OVERLAPPING 
lap to some extent upon high-school courses, but less 
than do the two thus far named, and courses in the 
calculus are even more markedly differentiated. Col- 
lege courses in science other than chemistry overlap 
less than do those in this subject upon corresponding 
high-school courses, sometimes because they are far- 
ther apart in the matter of typical student classifica- 
tion. There is, notwithstanding, a large amount of 
community of content in high-school courses and first 
college courses in biology, physics, physiography, etc. 
There is no occasion to believe that the situation 
touching courses in history other than American his- 
tory is essentially different from that shown for it, 
except where the student classifications for the corre- 
sponding courses are farther apart. The gap in this 
respect would usually be widest for courses dealing 
with the ancient world. Similarities and differences 
for political science and sociology and corresponding 
courses in the high school are probably somewhat an- 
alogous to those shown in economics. Certain fields, 
such as philosophy and psychology, are so infrequently 
represented in the lower unit that the content may be 
regarded as fully distinctive of the college. 
This brief survey of the unanalyzed subjects and 
courses leads to conclusions not differing widely from 
those already drawn, but at the same time to such as 
acknowledge a somewhat greater extent of difference 
and less of repetition in some subjects and courses.

THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
V. CurrENT EFFORTS TO OBVIATE REPETITION 
In the face of all the overlapping and repetition 
which appears to be the rule in the subjects and 
courses represented in both high school and college, 
little is done to obviate it, as may be judged from the 
following summary of practices in a large number of 
colleges and universities. 
1. Only a single catalogue among eighty-six selected 
at random gave evidence of attempting to avoid repe- 
tition in English: one college announces that it is pos- 
sible for the student to be excused from freshman 
rhetoric by passing an examination at the opening of 
the school year. 
2. The standardization of course sequences in older 
subjects, such as the ancient languages and mathe- 
matics, seems to satisfy the colleges on the score of 
overlapping, as no special adjustments appear in these 
fields despite what is almost a certainty of overlapping 
somewhat similar to that reported for higher algebra 
and college algebra. 
3. In approximately go per cent of the colleges two 
units of high-school modern language are counted the 
equivalent of a year of college work, the student with 
the former amount to his credit being admitted to 
second-year college courses in the same language. 
4. Chemistry is the only one of the college sciences 
in which there is any extent of effort to recognize the 
[ 296 ]  
-P-A-G-E-309
  OVERLAPPING 
fact of overlapping. In all others there is seldom, if 
ever, administrative acknowledgment, other than giv- 
ing entrance credit, that the student has had a high- 
school course in an identical line. Even in chemistry 
only twenty-four, or less than 30 per cent, of a total 
of eighty-six colleges make such acknowledgment. Of 
these, thirteen reduce the number of semester-hours 
(by an average of 4.4) required for the completion 
of the college course in general inorganic chemistry. 
Among these are five colleges which save the student 
as much as one year in entering advanced courses, and 
three which save him a half-year. The principal re- 
maining form of recognition is simply listing a sepa- 
rate course in general inorganic chemistry for students 
offering a high-school unit in this subject (the total 
number of credits for the course being the same as that 
for the regular beginning course) and concluding by 
putting those students no farther up in the depart- 
ment than others who have taken the course for stu- 
dents entering without high-school chemistry. There 
were nine such institutions represented in the group 
of catalogues examined. 
In all the social subjects those students who have 
had no high-school course in a particular field enter 
the same courses as those who present half or whole 
units of admission in the same field. 
There is thus an all too common disregard in the 
college of what the student has compassed in his period 
[297 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-310
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
of high-school training and, moreover, no notable 
tendency in the direction of proper recognition. The 
situation is not likely to experience early improvement 
for the reason already mentioned in this chapter, that 
the work repeated is given in two separate institutions 
the upper of which is unaware, and making no effort 
to become aware, of what is going forward in the 
lower. 
VI. THE OVERLAPPING SITUATION AS A WHOLE 
Overlapping in the offerings. Except for its intro- 
ductory portions all sections of this chapter have been 
concerned with overlapping in specific courses and sub- 
jects. In the studies summarized the foundation was 
laid for an estimate of the extent of overlapping in all 
subjects combined. Such an estimate is here essayed, 
and follows three main lines: (1) a study of college 
offerings classified as secondary, partly secondary, and 
collegiate; (2) a study on the same basis of work 
actually taken by students in the first two college 
years; and (3) an estimate of the proportion of the 
work taken during the first two college years which 
constitutes repetition of that taken in high school by 
the same students. 
The colleges whose offerings were examined for the 
first part of this study, which is in effect a comparison 
of college with high-school offerings, were eighty-six 
of those one hundred and fourteen whose catalogues 
[ 298 ]
-P-A-G-E-311
  OVERLAPPING 
were utilized in the study of college offerings reported 
in Chapter III, presenting the total offering to under- 
classmen. The shrinkage in number in the present 
instance was for the sake of economy in tabulation, 
omissions being made through a method of random 
selection. 
Classification of a course as secondary for present 
purposes does not assume that the course is identical 
in level with a high-school course, but it does assume 
that there is a large measure of identity in the content 
of courses frequently listed in high-school offerings. 
In order to decide with something like assurance that 
such courses are or are not often found in high schools 
the investigator had before him a table of frequencies 
of appearance of subjects of study and courses in 
approximately two hundred and fifty high schools 
randomly selected and distributed over the entire 
country. A complete exposition of the bases of classi- 
fying courses as partly secondary cannot be presented 
on account of limitations of space, but these bases are 
illustrated: (1) courses which are sometimes but not 
frequently offered in high schools, for example the 
short story, intermediate course in the modern lan- 
guages (that is, those beyond the second-year course 
in the high school) ; (2) courses in which there are 
many materials common to high-school courses but 
presumably fewer than for those classed as secondary, 
such as English poetry, inorganic chemistry for those 
[299 ]  
-P-A-G-E-312
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
entering with a high-school unit, and elementary ac- 
counting; (3) introductory courses given in high 
school more commonly as semester courses but more 
often in college as full-year courses, such as principles 
of economics; (4) courses in which the difference in 
level between high school and college is rather wide, 
owing to the fact that the high-school course is usually 
taken in the earlier years, for example physiography 
and botany; (5) introductory college courses having 
their analogues in the high-school offering but adminis- 
tered with prerequisites which put them on a higher 
level, like general physics. All other courses found 
available for under-classmen were classified as strictly 
collegiate. 
The departments in which the college offers con- 
siderable work classed as secondary are English, most 
of the foreign languages, chemistry and physics, his- 
tory, art, music, and the engineering and industrial 
group. Those in which it offers little or nothing on 
this level are public speaking (grouped with English) , 
Greek, Italian, biology, geology, astronomy, the social 
sciences, philosophy, psychology, Bible and religion, 
education, and home economics. Several subjects fall- 
ing within the groups just named—public speaking, 
biology, geology, political science, economics, and 
home economics—make their chief additions to the 
total of the offerings classified as secondary and partly 
secondary through the amounts and percentages of 
[ 300 ]
-P-A-G-E-313
  OVERLAPPING 
courses placed under the latter category. Of a total 
of twenty-nine departments of any considerable mag- 
nitude when measured by the total number of hours of 
work offered, only sixteen contain no work on the sec- 
ondary level, ten contain no work on the partly sec- 
ondary level, and eight contain none on either the 
secondary or the partly secondary level. The salient 
facts are that a generous fifth of all work offered to 
freshmen and sophomores in these eighty-six colleges 
is secondary and another generous fifth is partly sec- 
ondary, as defined ; in other words, between two fifths 
and a half is secondary and partly secondary, the 
remainder being more strictly collegiate. While the 
proportions in the several subject-groups differ, except 
for psychology, philosophy, etc., which include no 
secondary work, all contain large proportions of work 
below the distinctively collegiate classification. 
Overlapping in work taken by two hundred college 
students. Merely tabulating the courses offered to 
under-classmen, as was done in the study just re- 
ported, although it brings significant results, cannot 
be regarded as furnishing a full description of the ex- 
tent to which the work of junior-college years is of 
secondary or partly secondary grade. A more com- 
plete account is provided by a study the results of 
which are now to be summarized, which concerns the 
work actually taken by a group of students during 
their first two years in college. The students in this

instance were two hundred men and women who en- 
tered the College of Science, Literature, and the Arts 
in the University of Minnesota in the fall of 1920 and 
continued their residence during the two succeeding 
academic years ending in June, 1922. These students 
constitute an unselected group, being the first two 
hundred in alphabetical arrangement. 
Here again large proportions of the work are seen to 
be of the secondary and partly secondary classifica- 
tions. In fact, the percentages of the lower classes of 
work actually taken are far in excess of those offered. 
In five of the nine groups of subjects (that is, all ex- 
cepting science, social subjects, and the philosophical, 
esthetic, and occupational groups) there are larger 
proportions of secondary materials, in five groups 
there are larger proportions of partly secondary mate- 
rials, and in all but three groups there are larger pro- 
portions of secondary and partly secondary materials 
combined. In most instances the differences are 
marked. In harmony with this are the percentages 
for all subjects represented, which are 29.8 secondary, 
40.4 partly secondary, and 70.2 secondary and partly 
secondary combined, leaving in the distinctively col- 
legiate classification only 29.8 per cent of the courses 
taken. 
Overlapping in the nature of repetition. Up to this 
point in this section attention has been centered on 
the first type of duplication referred to in the quota-

THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
tion from President Angell’s paper near the opening 
of the chapter; namely, the appearance in collegiate 
offerings of materials identical or partly identical with 
those available in the high school below. One aspect 
of the general situation still requires examination— 
that to which President Angell refers as ‘‘the second 
instance,” where the student is required, after having 
been granted entrance credit for certain subjects, to 
repeat the materials represented in those subjects. 
Interest here focuses on the work taken in both high 
school and college by the same student or group of 
students. To ascertain the extent of overlapping that 
is in the nature of actual repetition, a careful study 
was made of the work taken in high school and in col- 
lege (first two years) by the two hundred students, 
the content of whose collegiate curricula was can- 
vassed for the paragraphs immediately preceding. 
Very few of this group of students entered college 
with less than four units of English. Freshman Eng- 
lish as administered in the College of Science, Litera- 
ture, and the Arts in the University of Minnesota is 
composed of both rhetoric and literature, the latter 
not adhering closely to the content of a typical first 
course in this field in colleges. Such a course is usually 
designated as the “history of English literature” or 
the “survey course” in English literature. Since we 
are here concerned with the typical or general situa- 
tion rather than with that in the University of Minne- 
[ 304 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  OVERLAPPING 
sota, overlapping will be estimated on the basis of 
what is typical, although the extent of repetition thus 
indicated is probably considerably in excess of the 
actual amount for the institution concerned. The 
writer feels that on the basis of the extent of over- 
lapping found in freshman composition and the history 
of English literature as summarized in foregoing sec- 
tions of this chapter, he is safely within the truth when 
he assumes that these typical two first college courses 
repeat for students who have had four units of high- 
school English at least one and a half units per student, 
and three fourths of this amount for those offering 
three units for admission. This turns out to be an 
estimated repetition of 36.4 per cent. 
On account of the standardization of courses in 
Latin—the predominant ancient language studied — 
there is little repetition in this field, although there is 
doubtless more than the fractional percentage (0.6) 
computed. On the assumption that two years of a 
modern language in the high school are the equivalent 
of as many quarters in the college, and that subsequent 
college work is a continuation,—not always a tenable 
assumption,—there is also little repetition in this 
field. Such as has been computed has its origin in 
demotion of the student to more elementary work 
where an instructor decides that preliminary work in 
the high school has not been well done, and this may 
at least in part not mean real repetition. The facts of

the study of overlapping in French referred to in an 
earlier section do not lead to a conclusion of a large 
extent of repetition for the individual student, except 
where he has taken his elementary French in some 
high school that exceeds the typical amount of ground 
covered in course. There are such high schools.

The amounts and percentages of repetition found 
for mathematics are likewise based on the assumption 
that the courses taken in college are distinctly con- 
tinuous with those pursued in the high school by the 
same students; for instance, that college algebra be- 
gins where higher algebra leaves off. This assumption 
[ 306 ]
-P-A-G-E-319
OVERLAPPING 
may be true for some institutions, but it is rendered 
untenable for any large group of colleges by the study 
in this field summarized in an earlier section. This 
study justifies an estimate of larger proportionate 
repetition. 
The estimate made indicates for those two hundred 
students a total extent of repetition of slightly less 
than a tenth of all science accepted for entrance. The 
three sciences most influential in this result are botany, 
zoology (animal biology), and physics, which were 
pursued both in high school and college by thirteen, 
eleven, and fifteen students respectively. As the Uni- 
versity of Minnesota administers separate courses in 
general inorganic chemistry for those who have had 
high-school chemistry and for those who have not, 
reducing by one third the credit carried by the course 
taken by the former group, repetition was assumed in 
the case of one student only, who, having had chemis- 
try in high school, took the longer college course. The 
assumption here is doubtless far short of the actual 
extent of repetition, as may be deduced from the sec- 
tion on overlapping in chemistry. Owing to the rela- 
tively small percentage of colleges making similar 
recognition of high-school chemistry, the extent of 
repetition in science for colleges generally must be 
much in excess of the 9.3 per cent computed. 
The large extent of duplication estimated for the 
social subjects (20.1 per cent) arises in the repetition 
[ 307 ]
-P-A-G-E-320
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
primarily of materials in modern and American his- 
tory, civics, and economics, although there is an 
occasional repetition in English history. An earlier 
section on overlapping in American history and eco- 
nomics, although it does not cover all courses here 
concerned, lends full support to the extent of repeti- 
tion assumed. 
The estimated proportion of repetition in all sub- 
jects, on the basis of the assumptions described, turns 
out to be 14.9 per cent. However, owing to the con- 
servative character of most of the assumptions, the 
actual repetition of materials can hardly be less than 
a full sixth to a fifth of all the work taken in the high 
school by such a group of students. This is equivalent 
to from two thirds to four fifths of a high-school year. 
Even after allowance is made for some measure of 
review to add to such fixation of fundamental skills as 
can be accomplished only by means of extended drill, 
what remains is a big price to pay for our attempts 
to divide secondary education between two separate 
institutions. 
VII. ImpricaTIoNs OF THE EXTENT OF 
OVERLAPPING FouND 
In brief the significance of the facts summarized in 
this chapter is that curricular offerings in the high 
school and in the college during freshman and sopho- 
more years have much in common and, as adminis- 
[ 308 ]
-P-A-G-E-321
  OVERLAPPING 
tered, involve a large amount of repetition by the 
individual student. The community of content argues 
that if the work in the lower unit is to be characterized 
as secondary, the bulk of that taken by the student 
during his first tw& years in the upper unit is likewise 
secondary. There is much of artificiality and little 
of logic in our present line of demarcation between 
secondary and higher schools. 
There are those who are disposed to contend that 
the individual student should repeat some of the work 
he has done in the high school. For grounds for this 
necessity they would resort to the traditional charges 
that high-school work of the present day is “‘ineffi- 
cient,” that its typical inadequacy obliges college 
teachers to cover the ground once more. It is conceded 
that some measure of renewed contact with materials 
already covered in the high school is desirable when a 
college student takes up again a subject to which he 
has given no thought for some months or a few years. 
It may even be that there are instances of some slight 
slump in efficiency of instruction in recent years be- 
cause teachers in high schools are confused and baffled 
by a mental democratization which has brought into 
the high school a wider range of native ability than 
was formerly represented there, a democratization 
which has confused college authorities even more than 
those in high schools. As a whole, however, efficiency 
of instruction may safely be assumed to have held its 
[ 309 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
own or even to have made substantial gains. The 
writer feels confident that the extent of repetition 
found is much in excess’of.the genuine necessities of 
the situation, and that a better organization of sec- 
ondary and higher education would have obviated 
most of it. This confidence is increased when it is 
recalled that the high-school courses represented in 
the preceding chapters were those going forward in 
cities most of which had populations of ten thousand 
and over. Most of the large amount of repetition 
would not be found if contracts were at all frequent 
between instructors in courses on the two levels 
represented. 
As it is, the repetition, going on unchallenged or 
with an inadequacy of adjustment to what the student 
has had in high school, must involve a staggering 
waste of time and demoralization of study habits. The 
types of adjustment now practiced have been seen to 
be at best only partial, the conclusion being that there 
is in the college an all too common disregard of what 
the student has compassed in his period of high-school 
training and no notable tendency in the direction of 
proper recognition. 
The facts presented and the conclusions drawn all 
point in a single direction, and that is toward the in- 
clusion of the junior-college years in a coherent plan 
of secondary schools. While some improvement can 
be effected through introducing junior-senior lines of 
[ 310 ]
-P-A-G-E-323
  OVERLAPPING 
cleavage in present-day higher institutions and through 
vigorous efforts at codperation between those responsi- 
ble for education on the high-school and junior-college 
levels concerned, these means will be inadequate to 
the needs of the situation. What is required is an 
organization of education that will bring into intimate 
and frequent contact the courses on the two levels and 
those presenting them. Only in this way can we have 
assurance of achieving in each field a realignment of 
courses that will promise the maximum of progress 
and training to students pursuing the sequences repre- 
sented. For instance, it is unlikely that after junior- 
college reorganization brings these years of work into 
close association with the work in the unit below we 
shall go on having (as is now a too frequent practice) 
two courses in American history—one taken typically 
in the twelfth grade, the other in the fourteenth or 
fifteenth grade, both of them attempting to exhaust 
the possibilities of the outstanding movements from 
the period of discovery to the present day. The same 
may be said of high-school and first college courses in 
other fields, such as chemistry, economics, and so on. 
The realignment should and will bring profound modi- 
fications of content and character of courses and a 
standardization in these respects not now possible. 
Only through junior-college reorganization of the type 
indicated shall we eliminate in the college superfluous 
repetition of ground already covered in the high school. 
[311 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
    THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Furthermore, only in this way shall we soon arrive at 
a place where educational advice to the student will 
assist in securing an approach to the proper distribu- 
tion of work to the several fields during his full period 
of secondary education. With the present tendency 
to think of these two levels as distinct periods of 
education, there is too little likelihood of achieving 
anything like a satisfactory distribution. 
Lest some may conclude that by introducing the 
junior college as proposed we shall merely be advanc- 
ing by two years the point at which ill-considered 
repetition begins, let it be observed that there can be 
relatively little of this repetition if the junior year is 
made the place of first emphasizing one’s specialty, 
as is now the predominant practice. With the period 
of general education concluded, most of the danger of 
superfluous repetition is removed.

EVALUATING THE TYPES OF JUNIOR 
COLLEGES 
I. Tat Movement SusTAINED 
Summary of the advantages of the movement. The 
materials presented in the foregoing chapters of this 
volume afford ample justification of the junior-college 
movement. Only an occasional aspect of the many- 
sided study of the new unit has turned out unfa- 
vorable to it, and in most of these exceptions the 
inadequacy can be ascribed to the sheer immaturity of 
the movement. As it is believed that this conclusion 
of justification has been given adequate support at 
appropriate points in the preceding pages, there is 
no intention to do more at the opening of this chapter 
than to direct the attention of the reader again in the 
briefest manner to some of the more prominent of 
the findings sustaining the right of the junior college 
to a place in our school system. 
1. It has been shown that in the extent of its offer- 
ing the average junior college does not fall far short 
of the work actually taken by most students during 
their first two years in the colleges of liberal arts. 
[ 313 ]
-P-A-G-E-326
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Although the new unit does not qualify so well on the 
requirements of the first two years of work in pre- 
professional curricula and in professional curricula 
opening with the freshman college year, it does not 
appear that sizable units cannot give all the general 
and special work needed by any considerable pro- 
portion of the total number of students in higher 
institutions. 
2. In certain aspects of the instructional situation 
the junior college does not yet measure up to other 
higher institutions. This statement applies to the ex- 
tent of graduate training that the instructors have had 
and to the proportions of instructors adequately 
trained for the subjects they are teaching. In other 
respects the comparison is more favorable, as in expe- 
rience, in remuneration, and in the extent of training 
in education. Observation of the actual work of teach- 
ing corroborates the conclusion drawn from a study of 
training and experience: that, although instructors in 
junior colleges seem on the average less well equipped 
from the standpoint of subject matter, at the same 
time they tend to be superior in instructional proce- 
dure. The same observation indicated an approxi- 
mation to equality in the average level of student 
performance in accredited junior colleges and in other 
higher institutions, this judgment being supported by 
the results of a comparison of average marks earned 
in their third year of work in standard higher institu- 
[ 314 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-327
  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
tions by junior-college graduates and by those who 
had earned the right to senior-college standing in an 
estimable state university. The progress of the junior 
college in these instructional matters during its brief 
history is an earnest of even more progress and of the 
ultimate attainment of satisfactory standards in all 
respects. There is no occasion to doubt that the junior 
college will achieve a type of instruction that is much 
more suited to students on this level than is much of 
the classroom procedure in present-day colleges and 
universities, in which there is too much effort to avoid 
lower-class teaching responsibilities to get wholesome 
and constructive results. 
3. The junior college will not only be well suited to 
serve the needs of those who should or can aspire to 
higher levels of training, but it is clearly better de- 
signed than are our typical higher institutions to pro- 
vide for those who should not or cannot go on. Its 
superiority in the solution of this problem rests in the 
fact that with the first two college years as terminal 
years in the school containing the junior college, there 
will be a marked tendency to look out for the interests 
of this group of students. 
This interest in these years as culminal years will 
result in the development of general curricula as 
well as special occupational (semiprofessional) cur- 
ricula ending with the close of the junior-college 
period. It is not to be expected that present-day 
[315]
-P-A-G-E-328
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
higher institutions will manifest a constructive interest 
in curricula of less than four years’ duration, because 
of their logically primary concern with students in 
curricula four or more years in length. Nor could stu- 
dents be induced to enroll in large numbers for such 
curricula, because of the loss of caste in aspiring to 
anything less than the completion of the typical length 
of curriculum in a given institution. 
4. Through proximity and lowered costs the junior 
college is in a position to make more nearly universal 
the opportunities of education on this level. This in 
turn, by removing a large part of the cost in these 
years, will make it more nearly feasible for many to 
secure training beyond the junior-college level. 
5. Judging from parents’ opinions and from the 
more youthful age of freshmen in junior colleges and 
in other higher institutions when they reside in the 
community of location than when they come from out- 
side, the new unit is looked upon by patrons as af- 
fording a continuation of home influences during the 
critical years of social immaturity. No matter what 
one’s opinion may be touching the reality of the moral 
hazard to students away from home during these first 
college years, the attitude of parents is a social force 
to be reckoned with, since it postpones continuance of 
education and entails a deplorable loss of time. More- 
over, few will doubt that there is an actual hazard, 
especially in institutions with large registrations and 
[ 316 ]
-P-A-G-E-329
  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
staffs inadequate to the purposes of social and moral 
guidance important for young persons. 
6. Not unrelated to this advantage is the greater 
attention affordable to the individual student in 
junior-college units. The marked difference as to 
size of class sections now obtaining between the new 
institution and the larger colleges and universities is 
likely in considerable part to disappear as we come to 
foster and maintain only sizable junior-college units. 
With a number of junior colleges in each state, how- 
ever, there will be few so large as to parallel the situa- 
tion that develops the attitude of unconcern toward 
the individual students and brings on the “‘depersonal- 
ization” which long since began to characterize the 
institutions affected by the ‘freshman flood.” 
7. Another element of superiority of the junior col- 
lege is (and will be more and more) that it gives to 
students on this level better opportunities for labo- 
ratory practice in leadership, for there are no upper- 
classmen, who in other higher institutions are usually 
elected to most positions of student responsibility. 
8. The junior-college movement has the support 
also of apparently inevitable forces of reorganization 
in higher education. Originating impulses here were 
the advancing age of the college entrant, the down- 
ward shift of materials of collegiate instruction, and 
the accompanying increase of entrance requirements, 
all of which provided the student with approximately 
[317]
-P-A-G-E-330
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
two more years of general training than he formerly 
received by the time he had reached any given year- 
point in his ccllege career. Upon the heels of these 
changes have come others in harmony with them. One 
was the changing organization of college curricula, 
which moved from complete prescription to almost 
complete election and then to the prescription of a 
major subject which the student almost always looks 
upon as occupational specialization and in the major- 
ity of instances makes use of occupationally subse- 
quently to graduation. Others are the accommodations 
that most colleges make to the desires of students for 
shortened periods of nonoccupational training; the 
trend of enrollment in higher institutions, which is 
reducing the proportions of students in the last two 
years of colleges of liberal arts whether these are in 
separate institutions or parts of universities, the line 
of cleavage appearing in universities between the 
sophomore and junior years; etc. Junior-college re- 
organization is also sustained by the argument of 
analogy with French and German school systems, since 
the latter include within the secondary school and the 
unit underlying it the whole of the period of general 
education, the university giving itself over entirely to 
specialization. 
g. Finally, the materials presented in Chapter VIII 
constitute a cogent argument for the junior-college 
movement, since they show not only a large extent of 
[ 318 ]
-P-A-G-E-331
  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
similarity and identity of work in the high school and 
on the junior-college level in colleges and universities 
but also a large amount of actual repetition for the 
individual student. To achieve such an organization 
and coérdination of courses on these two levels as to 
economize time and assure proper sequence it is im- 
perative that junior colleges be developed in intimate 
association with the high-school work below them. 
Special purposes of the junior college. The rather 
extended list of advantages of the junior college as 
just epitomized are readily transmutable into its 
special or distinctive purposes, and will hereafter be 
so designated. As justified up to this point, these 
purposes may be restated as follows: 
1. To give the first two years of curricula (1) in liberal 
arts and (2) in preprofessional and professional work 
(where these professional curricula begin with the first 
college year). 
2. To assure instruction as good as or better than that 
on the same level in other higher institutions. 
3. To provide terminal general education for those who 
cannot or should not go on to higher levels of training. 
4. To develop lines of semiprofessional training. 
5. To popularize higher education. 
6. To make possible the extension of home influences 
during immaturity. 
7. To afford more attention to the individual student. 
8. To improve the opportunities for laboratory prac- 
tice in leadership. 
[319] 
   
-P-A-G-E-332
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
9. To foster the inevitable reorganization of secondary 
and higher education. 
10. To bring together into a single institution all work 
essentially similar in order to effect a better organization 
of courses and obviate wasteful duplication. 
It is desirable to point out that one of these purposes 
is not distinctive in the same degree as are the . 
mainder. Reference is made in particular here to 
purpose 1. What subtracts from its distinctiveness is 
the fact that it is now being performed in our tradi- 
tional types of higher institutions. There are grounds, 
however, for retaining it as part of the complete list, 
since, if it cannot be accomplished, there would be no 
point in the acceptance of attempts at the performance 
of most of the others. 
II. Evatuatinc THE Matin Types oF 
JUNIoR COLLEGES 
Plan of evaluation. As the type or types of junior 
colleges to be encouraged should be those which will 
most effectively perform the special purposes of the 
institution, the logical procedure in evaluation must 
be the examination of each type as to the likelihood 
of such performance. This procedure will here be fol- 
lowed. The measure of likelihood is afforded for the 
most part in the materials already used in this volume, 
but additional data will be introduced at several points 
at which pertinent materials are available. The first 
[ 320 ]
-P-A-G-E-333
EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
step will be a concurrent scrutiny of three main types 
of junior colleges: (1) junior colleges in city or high- 
school districts, referred to here as public junior 
colleges, (2) private junior colleges, and (3) those 
maintained in connection with normal schools and 
teachers’ colleges, referred to as normal-school junior 
colleges. Certain considerations bearing on the desir- 
ability or undesirability of the second and third types 
will, however, be presented subsequently to the con- 
current canvass. Evaluation of occasional additional 
types will also be separately accomplished. 
Performing the special purposes in public, private, 
and normal-school junior colleges. 1. The stronger 
junior colleges in all three types may be judged from 
data presented in Chapter III to qualify on the former 
of the two aspects of the first special purpose, giving 
the first two years of curricula (1) in liberal arts and 
(2) in preprofessional and professional work. On the 
basis of average offerings public junior colleges lead 
the private junior colleges to some extent, the latter 
dropping somewhat more below the point of feasibility 
than the former. Special figures are not presented for 
normal-school junior colleges, but the writer’s visits to 
institutions of this type assure him that they will tend 
to qualify as readily on this score as the better junior 
colleges in city and high-school districts. But to 
justify the tentative minimum liberal-arts offering of 
two hundred and twenty-five to two hundred and fifty 
[321] 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
semester-hours on economic and other grounds, Chap- 
ter X makes apparent the desirability of a minimum 
of approximately one hundred and fifty liberal-arts 
students, which is not attained by a large proportion 
of any type of junior college. 
Strong junior colleges of all three types should also 
be able, if we may judge from other materials in 
Chapter III, to rise to the needs of the performance of 
the second aspect of this purpose. Public junior col- 
leges are seen to have made more progress in this 
direction than private junior colleges. One reason for 
this is that the former are universally coeducational, 
whereas the latter are in a large proportion of in- 
stances segregated and, more especially, women’s 
institutions. Since professionalization of women’s 
training is lagging behind men’s, private junior col- 
leges have less of a problem in measuring up to require- 
ments in this regard. At the same time the fact that 
private junior colleges are in such large proportions 
institutions for women only does not lead to an ex- 
pectation of early and general performance of this 
purpose for men. The private coeducational junior 
colleges are less well equipped at the present than are 
the public to care for the preprofessional requirements 
of both sexes. The normal-school junior colleges, on 
whose course offerings no data have been presented, 
are fully as certain as the public group to be able to 
qualify on these requirements. Numbers again being 
[ 322 ]
-P-A-G-E-335
  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
necessary to justify such offerings, a sizable student- 
body is essential. On this score, as has already been 
indicated, the public and normal-school units are 
somewhat in advance of the private units, although 
there should be a marked increase in average enroll- 
ments in all units to bring the fifty to one hundred 
additional students to warrant the provision of the 
additional courses pointed out in Chapter III as 
needed for the special groups concerned. 
2. The trend of the evidence in Chapter IV is that 
the public and normal-school junior colleges are in a 
somewhat better position than are the private units 
to assure instruction as good as or better than that on 
the same level in higher institutions. The advantage 
is in matters such as length of graduate training, ex- 
perience, salary, and observed teaching. Some private 
junior colleges would make a better showing in certain 
of these respects than some public and normal- 
school units, but as a group they lag somewhat. This 
means, of course, that if the private junior college 
aspires to achieve the purpose, it has farther to go 
than the other types, but it does not mean that the 
latter have no further progress to make. 
To provide teachers with even tolerably adequate 
preparation in all desirable fields of training, espe- 
cially those like the social subjects, in which the total 
offering is now not as large as in English, French, etc., 
junior colleges will need either to have very large 
[ 323 ]
-P-A-G-E-336
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
enrollments or to arrange for having teachers give in- 
struction in their own or related fields in some other 
associated educational unit. This is practicable in 
public junior colleges because of their association with 
secondary schools below them. It is practicable also 
in normal-school units because of the need of work in 
some of these lines in teacher-training curricula. It is 
less so in many private junior colleges because, as will 
be shown later in evaluating types by means of the last 
purpose (purpose 10), there has been a marked tend- 
ency toward atrophy of the academies or high schools 
associated with them. In striving to achieve this pur- 
pose the private junior college will have this additional 
obstacle to overcome. 
3. All institutions whose curricula end with the 
sophomore college year will be more disposed than are 
our colleges and universities to provide appropriate 
terminal general education for those who cannot or 
should not go on to higher levels of training. There- 
fore all types of junior colleges unassociated with in- 
stitutions where work on higher levels is available can 
qualify on this requirement. This statement, however, 
implies only qualified approval of junior-college units 
with plans or aspirations for upward extension to in- 
clude senior-college years. Responses on this point 
from heads of public and private junior colleges show 
that 16 and 42 per cent, respectively, entertain such 
aspirations. The proportion for the former group is 
[ 324 ]
-P-A-G-E-337
       EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
  negligible and concerns only junior colleges in large 
cities, but for the latter it concerns a proportion suffi- 
ciently large to be discouraging. It is evidence that 
a large proportion of the heads of private units still 
look longingly at the four-year college status./! To the 
extent that this is true it will tend to disqualify this 
type of unit for the performance of the special purpose 
under consideration, and this for somewhat the same 
reason that four-year colleges and universities are dis- 
qualified: their focus of attention is upon the longer 
curriculum and not upon the needs of students who 
are not going beyond the junior-college level. This 
same disqualification applies to normal schools with 
teachers’-college aspirations. In such of these normal 
schools as become teachers’ colleges, however, until 
their students come to be enrolled predominantly in 
the four-year curricula—which will not occur for 
many years or even decades—the well-established 
habit of looking upon the first two years beyond the 
high school as culminal years will to some extent foster 
the performance of this purpose. Nevertheless the 
presence of the longer curricula must gradually lessen 
the realizability of this important special function. 
4. The junior colleges unattached to four-year col- 
leges and universities will also, and for the same reason 
(that they will hasten the provision of terminal gen- 
eral education for those who cannot or should not go 
on), be first in developing semiprofessional lines of 
[ 325 ]
-P-A-G-E-338
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
training. As between public and private units, the 
advantage in this respect will come to rest with public 
institutions, just as the development of vocational 
training has been more vigorous in public than in pri- 
vate secondary schools. Occasional public junior col- 
leges have already made a beginning. Private junior 
colleges have, however, shown a larger development 
in home economics and teacher preparation. The 
growth in the former field is explained by the propor- 
tion of women’s institutions represented. 
The teacher-training function of junior colleges de- 
serves special consideration. A study of the distribu- 
tion of recent graduates of six public, seven Northern 
private (mostly in Missouri), eight Southern private, 
and two normal-school junior colleges shows the fol- 
lowing percentages, irrespective of sex, engaged in 
teaching: 1.3, 43.3, 41.8, and 13.7 respectively. Cor- 
responding percentages for women only are 2.0, 45.4, 
55.1, and 16.7. Some private institutions send negli- 
gible proportions of their graduates into teaching im- 
mediately upon completion of the junior-college work, 
but these institutions can be matched by others almost 
all of whose graduates enter this work. More com- 
monly it is elementary-school teaching into which 
these graduates go, but sometimes it is high-school 
teaching. For instance, two thirds of the graduates 
of one junior college entered teaching, and of this pro- 
portion fully two thirds went into high-school work.

  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
Little can be said in favor of this semiprofessional- 
training function characteristic of private junior col- 
leges, except that in the states represented it may be 
justified as a temporary expedient in view of a dearth 
of teachers properly prepared for the work upon which 
these junior-college graduates enter. As nothing short 
of four-year college graduation should be counte- 
nanced for high-school teaching, junior-college gradu- 
ates should not be permitted to qualify for it without 
further training. For elementary-school teaching the 
training received in junior colleges is not suitable, and 
the two-year course in the normal school is much to be 
preferred. It is obvious that the semiprofessional 
teacher-training function of the private junior college, 
although at present its predominant one, is hardly 
legitimate and affords no satisfactory permanent field 
of service for that unit. As standards of teacher prep- 
aration become more discriminating, the best we may 
look for is that this function will become preprofes- 
sional in character. 
5. The lower cost of education in the public junior 
college, as shown in Chapter V, puts that type of 
unit in a better position than the private institution 
to popularize higher education. Whatever is said for 
the public junior college in this connection appears 
to be just as applicable to the normal-school type. 
The extent of popularization in the two main types 
was tested by essaying a comparison between the num-

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
bers in each thousand of the population represented 
by those from the local community enrolled in public 
junior colleges and by those enrolled in the first two 
years of standard four-year colleges in the Middle 
West. For this purpose, only institutions in cities of 
ten thousand to seventy thousand population were con- 
sidered. The average of these measures for nine pub- 
lic junior colleges was 3.8, whereas the range was from 
0.76 to 8.9. The corresponding measures for fourteen 
standard colleges, freshman and sophomore years 
only, were 3.1 and 0.4 to 5.8. This shows some tend- 
ency to larger proportions for the public institutions. 
At one point in Chapter X it is shown that in the pres- 
ent state of development of public junior colleges they 
hold into the sophomore college year smaller percen- 
tages than do four-year institutions. If it is assumed 
that the new unit will in time come to hold into this 
year as large a percentage as does the standard college, 
—a reasonable assumption for the time when junior 
colleges are more firmly established,—the typical dif- 
ference between public and private junior colleges in 
the proportions of the population attending will be 
almost certain to be greater than the difference shown 
above, especially in view of the fact that there is 
typically no tuition charge for attendance upon the 
public junior college.

  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
junior colleges is their denominationalism. This is re- 
flected in a comparison of the denominational distribu- 
tions of the mothers of students in public and private 
junior colleges. Data of this sort were available for 
fifteen public and seven private institutions. In the 
public junior college with the smallest proportion the 
most common church membership or preference repre- 
sented (Methodist) was reported by fifty-seven, or 
20.4 per cent of the students responding. More than 
two thirds of the students reporting from this institu- 
tion— 68.2 per cent, to be exact—reported seventeen 
other denominations. The largest percentage among 
the public junior colleges in the most frequently rep- 
resented denomination was 36.1, or well over a third. 
The percentage for all public units was 27.9, somewhat 
in excess of a fourth of all mothers represented. Com- 
putations for the seven private units disclose a range 
of 27.3 to 93.9 per cent, with an average percentage 
of 51.1—slightly more than a half—for all students 
represented. The average proportion in a single de- 
nomination is almost twice as large as that for public 
junior colleges. In the private junior colleges the pre- 
dominant denomination is in every instance the one 
under whose auspices the institution is operating. 
The complete array of percentages for the predomi- 
nant denomination in private junior colleges shows 
that in occasional instances they drop to something 
like those for public units. With the continued break- 
[ 329 ]
-P-A-G-E-342
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
down of denominationalism these lower percentages 
should become more characteristic, thus providing 
some assurance that the private institutions will in 
time be able to draw something like equivalent propor- 
tions of the local populations. At the same time it 
should be borne in mind that this breakdown itself will 
remove one of the most influential of the arguments 
for education under private control. 
Before leaving the consideration of the three main 
types of junior colleges from the standpoint of the 
likelihood that they will perform the function of popu- 
larizing higher education, it is desirable to point out 
that if an institution is public it is almost certain that 
an increasing proportion of the population will avail 
themselves of its opportunities. This has been found 
true for other public educational institutions, such as 
the high school and the state university ; and the force 
should be no less operative for the upward extension 
of public secondary education, especially, let it be 
repeated, since education in these public units is typi- 
cally being provided free of cost or nearly so. 
6. All types of junior colleges will make possible 
the extension of home influences during immaturity 
to the extent that they serve local constituencies. In 
this respect the public junior college, because it is at 
present almost exclusively locally patronized, is easily 
the leader. Judging from what was shown in evaluat- 
ing the three types in terms of purpose 5, we may ex- 
[ 330 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-343
  
  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
pect the public and normal-school types to continue 
to lead the private institutions in this respect. On the 
other hand, as is made clear in the following chapter, 
committal to a proper system of public junior colleges 
will call for units of such size as to take in from with- 
out the community of location larger proportions of the 
total student-body than they do at present, and to 
that extent will make it impossible for the junior col- 
leges to preserve home influences for all students. 
This fact suggests the advisability of caution in the 
selection of cities in which such colleges shall be estab- 
lished, so that at least the majority of the student- 
body may be recruited from the immediate vicinity. 
7. In terms of the enrollments of junior colleges as 
shown in Chapter I the possibility of affording more 
attention to the individual student than can be given 
in the larger colleges and universities places the three 
main types in the following order: private junior col- 
leges, public junior colleges, and normal-school junior 
colleges. At the same time it is apparent that few if 
any units of any type are so large as to put adequate 
individual attention out of consideration. Further- 
more, since the desirable minimum enrollment sup- 
ported by the findings of this report—something like 
two hundred students—must apply to such institu- 
tions irrespective of type, the reduction in opportun- 
ities for this kind of attention to the student must 
come to all alike. To argue for a minimum student- 
[331 ]

THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
body much smaller than that named is to argue for a 
relatively prohibitive cost level or the reduction of 
desirable course offerings. 
8. All three types of junior colleges here considered 
should be able to qualify on the requirement for 
improving the opportunities for laboratory practice 
in leadership, with the exception of those teachers’- 
college units in which the number of third-year and 
fourth-year students is large enough to prevent those 
in the first and second years from winning opportuni- 
ties for leadership in student activities, or in normal 
schools in which the teacher-training enrollment is 
relatively so large as to overwhelm the junior-college 
group. Data have been presented to indicate that the 
development of these activities has gone somewhat 
farther in private units than in public units. 
9. The three types of junior colleges are very un- 
equally matched in their capacity to foster the reor- 
ganization of secondary and higher education toward 
which it has been seen that we are moving. The types 
unassociated with high schools below them will make 
some slight contribution in this direction, but much 
more is to be expected from those maintained in con- 
nection with strong secondary schools. The logic of 
reorganization is to administer these junior-college 
years as an upward extension of the units of our sys- 
tem now devoted primarily to general education and 
to avoid a multiplication of units in the system, rather 
[ 332 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
  
  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
than to make it even more unwieldy than it is at the 
present time. Complexity would be added by increas- 
ing the problems of articulation. That type of junior 
college is to be preferred which encourages the de- 
velopment of closely articulating units in a coherent 
system of general education, and this is the public 
junior college developed in association with our public 
high schools. 
Tested by this purpose the normal-school junior 
colleges do not qualify because the tendency to elevate 
normal-school standards has resulted in removing from 
most of them the high-school work they once had. 
Only recently have those which are developing into 
teachers’ colleges taken steps to introduce high-school 
work, and in these instances the aim is to provide 
practice facilities for students training to be high- 
school teachers and not to reéstablish high-school 
courses in terms of their former function of providing 
the foundation of general training for prospective 
elementary-school teachers. 
The private junior college also is handicapped in 
this respect, in that, as was foreshadowed in discussing 
purpose 2 and as will be made clear in dealing with 
the next and last purpose, the academy or high school 
associated with it has in most cases become of rela- 
tively inconsequential concern.

better organization of courses and obviate wasteful 
duplication, it is just as necessary as in achieving the 
foregoing purpose (if not more necessary) to avail 
ourselves predominantly of a type of junior college 
that permits close association with the work of the 
high-school years immediately below the junior col- 
lege. As already stated, this is the public junior 
college in city and high-school districts. The normal- 
school and private types cannot serve as well in this 
important respect. The reason for this inaptitude is, 
in the case of the normal school, that its high-school 
work is in most instances gone; in the private junior 
colleges if the high-school work has not gone it is 
going. 
The fact that it is disappearing in the normal school 
is so well known as not to require mention. Some 
notion of what is happening in private secondary edu- 
cation may be had from the facts presented by Bon- 
ner,’ who showed that the public secondary school has 
been gaining steadily on the private school since 1890. 
From that date until 1918, public high schools mounted 
from 60.8 to 87.2 per cent of all institutions of this 
grade, while the percentage of students enrolled in 
these public institutions increased from 68.1 to 91.2. 
With the trend so markedly in this direction it is 
hardly to be anticipated that the tide could be set

    EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
sufficiently in the opposite direction to assure the large 
secondary-school enrollments that are desirable for 
the performance of the function in question. 
A more direct measure of present possibilities in 
private institutions compared with public institutions 
is afforded by a computation that takes into account 
the number of students enrolled in senior high-school 
and freshman. college classes. The data utilized were 
collected at the time of visiting the schools represented 
and pertain to the school year 1921-1922. Enroll- 
ments in the last high-school year in public units range 
from 87.8 to 841.5 per cent of those in the first junior- 
college year, with an average of 232.1 per cent for 
all represented. For private junior colleges the range 
is 7.4 to 300.0, with an average of 46.8. The average 
for all private units is not far from a fifth of that for 
public units. With the high-school enrollment rela- 
tively so inconsequential in private institutions and 
with the tendency of the public secondary school to 
gain consistently on the private secondary school, the 
chances are not strong that the private unit will be in 
a position to qualify on purpose 10. Some, however, 
are in a position to meet this requirement at the 
present time, although they will need a change of 
policy in the direction of encouraging rather than dis- 
couraging the development, enrollment, and work on 
the high-school level.

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
III. Tut Normat-ScHoot TyPE As A 
SPECIAL PROBLEM 
The problem. There has been such a battle of 
words over the junior college in the normal schools 
that no evaluation of types would be regarded as com- 
plete without giving this question some special con- 
sideration. The argument has not centered so much 
around the question of the feasibility of giving the 
junior-college work in normal schools as of the desir- 
ability of doing so, in view of an assumed violation of 
the teacher-training functions of institutions with 
which the junior-college units are associated. As this 
possible infringement on original functions has been 
said to express itself in several ways, it will be con- 
sidered under two heads: the possible inroads of the 
junior college upon (1) the available source of a 
teacher-training student-body numerically and in men- 
tality and (2) the dominance of the professional atti- 
tudes in teacher-training institutions. 
Does provision of junior-college work cut in on the 
available supply of candidates for teacher-training ? 
It is a matter of common knowledge that for a con- 
siderable proportion of their student-bodies higher 
institutions depend upon the youth of the community 
of location, and this dependence must characterize 
normal schools and teachers’ colleges at least as much 
as other types. In an important sense the community 
[ 336]
-P-A-G-E-349
  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
of location of a normal school has an obligation to the 
state to provide a large proportion of the total number 
of candidates for teachers’ certificates who should be 
trained in that particular normal school. This obliga- 
tion must apply peculiarly at a time when there is a 
dearth of adequately trained teachers for elementary- 
school work, preparation for which is the primary 
concern of the normal school. There is some justifica- 
tion for the statement that, to the extent that the of- 
fering of junior-college courses attracts students away 
from the teacher-training curricula, the normal schools 
are not keeping faith with the purpose which brought 
them into existence, which is teacher-training.

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
distribution of freshmen in two normal schools with 
junior colleges supply an illuminating indirect answer. 
The two significant facts in the distribution are the 
predominance of men in the junior-college group and 
the very small, almost negligible, proportion of this sex 
in the “regular” normal groups. The proportionate 
distribution of students from the local community is 
very similar. For example, of seventy-five students 
from the community of location in one of these institu- 
tions twenty-two are enrolled in the regular normal 
curriculum and twenty-eight in the junior-college 
curriculum. One only of the twenty-two is a man; 
only six of the twenty-eight are women. It is known 
to all those who are in touch with normal-school regis- 
tration that the negligible proportion of men in the 
regular curricula is characteristic irrespective of the 
presence of a junior-college offering. This fact, joined 
with the relatively small proportion of women in 
junior-college curricula, leads to the conclusion that 
in these institutions the junior-college curricula can 
make at most only moderate inroads on a potentially 
available teacher-training student-body. Some in- 
roads, however, they do make. | 
Does provision of junior-college work reduce the 
quality of candidates for teacher-training ? This ques- 
tion has been answered in large part by inference from 
the foregoing discussion. If the junior-college enroll- 
ment is made up largely of men who but infrequently 
[338]

-P-A-G-E-351
  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
register for regular normal curricula, there can be 
nothing like a general tendency for the junior college 
to drain off the superior students, leaving the less 
capable for the regular normal course. Nevertheless, 
since the question is an important one, conclusions 
drawn from a study of test scores of students so far 
represented and of one other group will be set forth 
for as much of an answer as can be essayed here. 
The distribution and the medians of test scores for 
men in the junior-college group are notably higher 
than those for women in the regular normal group, the 
difference being too large to be accounted for by the 
usual sex differences between men and women as 
shown by the army test. The difference between these 
two groups, moreover, is without doubt the chief fac- 
tor of the difference in median scores for regular nor- 
mal and junior-college groups, which vary from 120.4 
for the former to 135.4 for the latter. While this is 
being admitted we should not lose sight of the high 
range of scores for women in the junior-college group. 
Of the twenty-one women represented not a single 
score drops below 120, which is almost identical with 
the median score for women in the regular normal 
group (120.3). At the same time the upper limits of 
the range are practically the same for the two groups 
of women. Certainly, although there are not many of 
them, women enrolling in the junior-college curricu- 
lum are a selected group. It would not be at all sur-

EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
training functions in normal schools could claim, the 
new median would be only 122.9—not three points 
above that for women in regular normal work. 
To find out whether the draining off of superior 
minds from regular normal curricula, which is assumed 
to follow the introduction of junior-college work, 
applies particularly to students from the community 
where they are located, students in regular normal 
curricula in one of the two normal schools so far repre- 
sented in this section have been classified as coming 
from within and without the city of location, and the 
distributions and medians of their mental-test scores 
have been compared. Before passing judgment the 
reader should bear in mind that there is at least 
one other line of work besides the junior-college offer- 
ing—the high-school teacher-training curriculum— 
which in these normal schools is also likely to make 
inroads on the quality of the regular normal group. 
The validity of the findings of the comparison is some- 
what affected by the small number of students from 
the city where they are located, but there appears to 
be no such reduction in quality as suggested. 
Comparison on the basis of mental-test scores of 
students in teacher-training and junior-college cur- 
ricula in another institution similar in type to those of 
Wisconsin has also been made. The institution con- 
cerned is the State Teachers College in San Diego,

seems, thus, to be a larger proportion of women in the 
junior-college group than in Wisconsin, which sug- 
gests larger inroads on the available teacher-training 
student-body, on the assumption that teacher-training 
curricula would attract most of the women registering 
in a given institution. The distributions and medians 
show a marked superiority of junior-college men over 
women in both junior college and teachers’ college. 
These measures for the two groups of women are no- 
tably similar, indicating that even if the provision of 
junior-college curricula cuts in numerically on the 
available supply of candidates for teacher-training, it 
does not affect the quality as indicated by the mental- 
test scores. 
From the materials presented touching the two in- 
stitutions in Wisconsin and the one in California the 
following conclusion is drawn: although there is some 
likelihood that the establishment of junior-college cur- 
ricula in normal schools and teachers’ colleges tends to 
affect somewhat unfavorably the number or the qual- 
ity of candidates for teacher-training curricula, the 
testimony seems not to be particularly damaging to 
junior-college units of this type. This degree of detri- 
ment alone seems not to be sufficiently large to dis- 
credit the normal-school junior college. 
Other considerations pro and con. Various objec- 
tions other than those so far treated have been raised 
against the establishment of junior-college work in

monly recurring. The complaints of those who oppose 
the movement as it affects normal schools center about 
[ 344]
-P-A-G-E-357
  
EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
the desirability of conserving the primary function of 
a teacher-training institution. Says one writer :* 
The normal school was created for a special purpose. 
Its existence is justified on the grounds of peculiar adapta- 
tion to the ends it serves, the preparation of teachers. . . . 
The normal-school activities should be a sort of specialized 
industry, not an educational department store. 
All this writer’s subsequent arguments are to the effect 
that introducing junior-college curricula impairs the 
performance of this primary function. 
The normal school should be an institution of character- 
istic professional atmosphere. . . . The junior college, as 
an adjunct, has nothing in common with the professional 
school for teachers. The student in the junior college 
probably has no well-defined, specific end in view; or, if 
he has, that end is far removed. ... He is a bird of 
passage, a preparatory student for the university or senior 
college. . . . The normal school will lose prestige when 
it assumes to prepare for these. 
Perhaps the most complete attempt to answer such 
objections which has so far made its appearance, and 
at the same time the briefest, is that by President 
Maxwell, from whose defense of the junior college in 
the normal school we quote on page 346:?

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Our junior-college work supplements and aids the pro- 
fessional training of teachers in the following ways: 
1. It provides a broader scholastic foundation for pros- 
pective teachers who plan to do departmental or higher 
grade work, or to teach in the junior high school. . . . 
2. The prospective teacher with ambition to pursue spe- 
cial fields in later university study, seeks the privilege of 
beginning his studies in the normal school. . . . 
3. Our junior-college work provides the opportunity 
and emphasizes the necessity for higher scholarship for 
teachers. ... 
4. The junior-college work leads naturally and effec- 
tively into the four-year professional curriculum for teach- 
ers and supervisors in elementary education. . . . The 
four-year teacher-training curriculum of the near future 
will therefore rest upon the two basic years of general cul- 
ture which now form the junior college. When the four- 
year teacher-training curriculum comes, the junior college 
will be superseded though not abandoned. During the 
transition period the junior college is a desirable means of 
making the curriculum or content subjects “pay for them- 
selves.? When normal schools become four-year colleges 
with power to grant degrees, their junior colleges, as such, 
will be absorbed.* 
5. Our junior-college work has brought three and four 
times as many young men into elementary education as 
were previously preparing for this form of service. . . . 
6. The presence of young men in the normal school 
(brought about by the junior-college work) tends to

  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
promote a saner atmosphere [along social lines] among 
the young-women students. . . . 
7. The junior-college group foster athletics and other 
school enterprises and develop and justify a school enthu- 
siasm and esprit de corps that are a boon to every prospec- 
tive teacher. 
8. The junior-college work has a definitely stimulating 
effect upon the faculty of the institution. It enables the 
school to secure more scholarly men and women and to 
hold them longer against the competition of larger and 
stronger institutions. . . . 
Before passing on to a critique of these arguments it 
is apposite to cite certain factual materials which have 
come to the attention of the writer. These materials, 
which relate to the fifth claim put forward by President 
Maxwell—the increase in the number of men entering 
educational work—and are in harmony with evidence 
that may be secured in all normal schools and teachers’ 
colleges having some curricula more than two years in 
length, are as follows: of the fifty-one junior-college 
graduates of 1921 in the two Wisconsin normal schools 
represented elsewhere in this chapter, eighteen trans- 
ferred at the opening of the next year to the third year 
of the high-school teacher-training curricula. All but 
two of these transfers were men. Other students, most 
of them men, transfer to these curricula before com- 
pleting the two years of junior-college work. 
[ 347]  
-P-A-G-E-360
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
Although the writer spent a number of days in visit- 
ing several normal schools and teachers’ colleges in 
which junior-college units are maintained, endeavor- 
ing to discover, both in class and out, evidences of un- 
toward influences on the teacher-training function, he 
became aware of fewif any. Perhaps these detrimen- 
tal effects are of a sort to elude observation during the 
brief stay of a day or two in each of five institutions, 
but nothing was seen over which to become exercised. 
Perhaps also the position of dominance in numbers 
and tradition which teacher-training groups still hold 
in these particular institutions is instrumental in 
checking any hurtful influences, and these may not 
manifest themselves until such time as the junior- 
college enrollment exceeds the teacher-training enroll- 
ment. Instead of detrimental influences the visitor 
felt that the junior college was, as a whole, beneficial 
in its effect upon the primary function of the institu- 
tions visited. 
But even should all these arguments favorable to 
the establishment of junior-college units in normal 
schools be accepted at par, they do not make a strong 
case for this type when compared with others from 
the viewpoint of junior-college functioning. These 
arguments have one characteristic in common: they 
would convince us that the junior college will make for 
an improved teacher-training institution. While a 
teacher-training situation superior to our present one 
[ 348 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-361
  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
is to be desired, the primary purpose of the new unit 
is certainly not that which the champions of its estab- 
lishment in normal schools (if we may judge by their 
emphasis) would make it. The junior college has 
fundamental purposes that far transcend this one, 
however important it may be regarded. 
This tendency on the part of normal-school authori- 
ties to lose sight of the real functions of the junior col- 
lege is strikingly illustrated in the italicized portions 
of the fourth point made in the quotation from Presi- 
dent Maxwell’s article. The junior college is there 
seen as a stepping-stone for the normal school on its 
way to the status of teachers’ college. After the lat- 
ter consummation the junior college is “absorbed.” 
And after this absorption has taken place, where is 
this new unit which we have seen to possess qualities 
that warrant assigning it a permanent place in the 
school system? 
That the opinion of President Maxwell works out 
as a tendency is shown in what is taking place in 
Wisconsin normal schools. Given authority in 1911 
to establish junior-college curricula, they have relin- 
quished their claims to being junior colleges and are 
asking to be made four-year teachers’ colleges with 
power to grant degrees. 
There is here no desire to deny the right to some 
stronger normal schools, as the need arises, to be raised 
to the rank of teachers’ colleges. This development 
[ 349 ]
-P-A-G-E-362
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
for many is doubtless inevitable in the evolution of the 
American school system and in the elevation of stand- 
ards in the teaching profession. The objection raised 
is solely to the abuse of an institution which deserves 
to be established under auspices that will assure it a 
longer life. This ambition to extend curricula beyond 
the second-year collegiate level is common to the nor- 
mal schools and to two fifths of the private junior 
colleges, as reported earlier in the chapter. To the 
extent that the ambition is entertained and realizable 
it disqualifies both types in the achievement of the 
special purposes of the junior college, since it encour- 
ages a focus of attention upon the longer curricula 
in much the same sense as is now the case in colleges 
and universities. 
Concluding comment. Special examination of the 
junior-college situation (both present and prospec- 
tive) in normal schools indicates that although some 
small inroads upon the teacher-training function are 
likely to be made by reducing the numbers and quality 
of those entering the teacher-training curricula, this 
disadvantage is almost certain to be offset by improve- 
ment in performing the function for which these 
normal schools were established. Simultaneously, how- 
ever, because these institutions have their eyes on the 
four-year teachers’ college as a goal, there must be 
a dwindling hope that they will look out for the 
continued performance of those special purposes of a 
[350]

EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
junior college which depend upon regarding the first 
two college years as terminal years for an increasing 
proportion of students. The fact should not be over- 
looked, moreover, that this type of unit is disqualified 
because it cannot also perform the ninth and tenth 
purposes listed above, the achievement of which de- 
pends upon the close association of junior-college years 
with those immediately below. To carry out these 
purposes it would be necessary for these institutions to 
revert to the status from which they have for so long 
endeavored to be emancipated—the status of the 
secondary school. 
IV. FurTHER CONSIDERATION OF THE PRIVATE 
JuNtior COLLEGE 
In the comparison involved in the evaluation of the 
three main types of junior colleges at a previous point 
in this chapter the private junior college did not fare 
very well, in terms of either its present state or its 
prospective development. Because of its relative 
character this degree of disparagement is likely to 
underrate the opportunities for service that this unit 
has in the current educational situation. In all fair- 
ness it should be admitted that many private junior 
colleges are in a position to render a really estimable 
service for decades to come. They will do this not 
only in the educational opportunities afforded but also 
[351]
-P-A-G-E-364
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
in their contribution to the popularization of the 
junior-college idea or plan of organization. 
Our gratitude for these benefits should not, how- 
ever, blind us to the limitations indicated nor to the 
need of rectifying certain current untoward conditions. 
One of the chief hindrances to wider service of private 
junior colleges is the present cost to the student, par- 
ticularly to the student who leaves home to attend. 
This cost is actually rather low in some private junior 
colleges, but we have seen that the trend is for attend- 
ance in these units to be more expensive than in stand- 
ard higher institutions. The means of reduction must 
be through having sources of income other than stu- 
dent fees, such as endowments, with which private 
junior colleges are too meagerly supplied, or more 
generous church support, or both. And as endowments 
come, it is essential that the authorities in charge re- 
main loyal to the junior-college idea and not yield to 
the temptation that we know exists to betray it by 
adding senior-college years just as soon as the financial 
conditions can be stretched to the point of warranting 
the move. 
One element of cost in maintaining private junior 
colleges deserves special emphasis here, as under pres- 
ent financial conditions in these schools it is bound to 
be carried ultimately by the student in attendance or 
by some other person bearing the burden of such at- 
tendance. This is the cost of publicity. A large pro- 
[352] 
 
-P-A-G-E-365
    
EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
portion of private junior colleges have extraordinarily 
heavy budget items to cover this charge. Expendi- 
tures along these lines as ascertained by personal 
inquiry in nine private institutions were found to total 
between $35,000 and $36,000, not including steno- 
graphic assistance. The items included are the cost of 
catalogues and view-books, advertising in church and 
secular periodicals, salaries and expenses of personal 
solicitors, and the like. As the total enrollment in 
high-school and junior-college departments in these 
nine institutions was 1434, there was an average ex- 
penditure for these items of between $24 and $25 per 
student. To include students who enroll for special 
work only would bring a somewhat lower average cost. 
For a few private units visited the cost for publicity 
was almost negligible; for others in this group it 
mounted to an average of more than $40 per student. 
Some idea of the significance of such expenditures 
may be gained from comparing them with the cost 
of publicity in public junior colleges. For eight public 
junior colleges visited the total outlay for publicity 
items—almost exclusively for modest bulletins or cat- 
alogues—was $463. Since in these units this expendi- 
ture is made for junior-college students only, who 
numbered 666, the average cost is hardly 70 cents per 
student. This comparison suggests the need for efforts 
in private junior colleges to reduce expenditures along 
these lines, thereby making possible a reduction in 
[353]
-P-A-G-E-366
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE. MOVEMENT 
costs to the student or a diversion to the educational 
functions of the school of a larger proportion of all the 
funds available. 
Two occasional additional hindrances to performing 
in private institutions in any genuine way the special 
purposes of the junior college are to be found in the 
fact that (as mentioned in Chapter I) some of these 
are strictly private-venture schools, and the further 
fact that some still retain undesirable characteristics 
of the obsolescent “finishing school.” Private owner- 
ship turns out to be an obstruction because of the 
obvious ineptitude to the performance of several sig- 
nificant junior-college purposes in schools which are 
looked upon as commercial enterprises by those who 
direct them. The second fact is a hindrance for rea- 
sons somewhat similar and because the finishing school 
never has been disposed to adjust itself to the perform- 
ance of legitimate educational functions. The private 
junior-college movement will do well to avoid these 
two influences incompatible to its best development. 
V. OTHER TyPEs oF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
The remaining types. Up to this point only the 
three predominant forms of the junior college have 
been evaluated: the public type (in city and high- 
school districts), the normal-school type, and the pri- 
vate type. Occasional variations of form taken by the 
[354]
-P-A-G-E-367
  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
movement or proposed for it, however, demand con- 
sideration. Some have been listed as junior colleges 
on state foundations, and they were therefore grouped 
with the normal-school type in Chapter I. Most of 
these schools are either avowedly or essentially 
branches of other state higher institutions, either of 
universities or of colleges of agriculture and mechanic 
arts. Other types are those maintained as lower divi- 
sions of universities, state and private, as described in 
Chapter VII. In addition to these, one occasionally 
hears a proposal to provide a state system of well- 
distributed two-year junior-college units unassociated 
with other schools, either lower or higher, now in 
existence. 
Their evaluation. Since the criteria have already 
been presented and applied to related types, evaluation 
of these additional forms taken by the junior college 
or proposed for it can be accomplished in brief space. 
The “branch” unit is not to be commended as an 
appropriately typical junior college. It should be un- 
dertaken only where the ultimate goal of the branch 
is admittedly the paralleling of certain lines at least of 
the upper levels of work in the parent institution or 
where the distribution of population is such as to urge 
it in preference to the type that is a part of the public 
secondary school. Sooner or later local ambitions and 
political pressure may bring a demand for upward 
extension, and the state embarking on such a program 
[355] 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
will then face the necessity of supporting several co- 
ordinate higher institutions. Since the public type is 
almost universally closely associated with the high 
school, it is much more certain to be conceived of as a 
part of the lower school system and therefore cannot 
in most instances logically aspire to senior-college 
levels of training. 
The branch type is especially to be deplored if it 
brings with it, as has been true in some instances, pro- 
visions for the high-school work below. The function 
of our higher institutions is certainly not to set up a 
system of secondary schools competing with and dupli- 
cating the work of the state’s system of high schools 
already in operation. 
On the other hand, if on this account the high-school 
work below should not be and is not maintained in 
connection with these branch junior-college units, we 
thwart the chances of reorganization and economy 
urged in purposes 9 and to (p. 320). This type of 
junior college would increase rather than diminish the 
problems of articulation of the several units of our 
school system. This last reason should just as em- 
phatically preclude serious consideration of the sepa- 
rate type of junior-college unit sometimes proposed ; 
namely, the type unassociated with other schools in 
the system. 
Concerning the type of junior college that is a 
lower division of present-day colleges and universities 
[ 356 ]
-P-A-G-E-369
  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
it is scarcely necessary to say more than has been said 
in Chapter VII or is implicit in the need for perform- 
ance of most of the distinctive purposes of the junior 
college. Even if this line of cleavage in higher institu- 
tions becomes more prevalent than at present, as 
seems certain, most of the functions peculiar to the 
junior college must remain unachieved unless other 
types maintained in connection with institutions ter- 
minating with the second college year are established 
and come in time to displace these years in our colleges 
and universities. This must apply especially to pro- 
viding satisfactory terminal general education for 
those who cannot or should not go on, to popularizing 
higher education, to making possible the extension of 
home influences during immaturity, to affording more 
attention to the individual student, to improving the 
opportunities for laboratory practice in leadership, to 
fostering the inevitable reorganization of secondary 
and higher education, and to bringing together into a 
single institution all work essentially similar, in order 
to effect a better organization of courses and obviate 
wasteful duplication. Although there are several rea- 
sons for advocating the line of cleavage to which refer- 
ence is made, the highest commendation for it is that 
it is a natural first step toward a surrender of work on 
this level to the enlarging secondary school below. 
Many of the same considerations that urge the ulti- 
mate discontinuance of the first two years of work in

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
the university and its provision in connection with 
strong secondary schools oppose maintaining one of a 
system of junior colleges in a state as a part of its 
existing universities or other higher institutions. If it 
is provided in the community where such institutions 
are located, it should be as a part of the community’s 
lower school system, just as now the high-school work 
is not administered by the university but by the local 
community. 
VI. Tue Loctcat ORGANIZATION OF 
SECONDARY EDUCATION 
The problem of appropriate organization of the 
future secondary school. The foregoing evaluation 
having shown that the junior college maintained in 
connection with city and high-school districts is the 
one best designed to achieve the purposes of the insti- 
tution, the problem next centers about the appropriate 
means of incorporating it in our secondary-school 
organization. It is obvious that this question cannot 
be settled without reference to other important tend- 
encies toward reorganization of our systems of lower 
and secondary schools. Evidence shows that the older 
eight-four organization is rapidly passing, and that in 
its place is coming a regrouping which provides for 
beginning the period of secondary education two years 
earlier than formerly ; that is, with the seventh grade. 
For instance, Superintendent Pratt of Spokane in a 
[358 ]
-P-A-G-E-371
EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
recent article’ gives reports from sixty cities in the 
United States with populations of 100,000 and over. 
Twenty-six have junior high schools in operation, and 
twenty more have them in various stages of prepara- 
tion. As these sixty replies were received from a total 
of sixty-eight cities to which the blanks of inquiry were 
sent, there can be little doubt that, as Superintendent 
Pratt putsit, the “junior highschoolis . . .‘thecom- 
ing plan of organization.’” His data indicate also that 
the almost universal grouping of the six high-school 
years is three in the junior unit and three in the senior 
unit. This movement is making rapid gains also in 
cities of smaller size. 
The six-four-four organization. This marked tend- 
ency to extend the period of secondary education 
downward and to divide it into units raises the ques- 
tion of the practicability of adding still another unit of 
two years at the top, thereby making for a three-unit 
secondary school with three years in each of the two 
lowest units and two years in the last of the units. A 
much more sensible procedure seems to be the division 
of the full eight-year secondary-school period into two 
units of four years each and their administration after 
a manner similar to that being followed with respect 
to our present-day junior and senior high schools. 
This concept of a six-four-four organization of edu-

cation is not without precedent in thought and prac- 
tice. It was proposed in 1915 by a committee of the 
North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary 
Schools, a part of whose report is quoted :* 
The main subdivisions of elementary and secondary 
education should therefore be as follows: 
First—The Elementary School, six grades. 
Second— The Lower Secondary, to include the Seventh, 
Eighth, Ninth, and Tenth years of the usual school course. 
Third—The Upper Secondary, to include the present 
Eleventh and Twelfth Grades of the usual High Schools 
and the Freshman and Sophomore years of the usual 
American Colleges. 
Whether it will take a student four or three years to 
complete the curriculum of either of these stages of Sec- 
ondary Education will depend upon whether he is able to 
carry at one time three or four studies and whether the 
school year consists of thirty-six or forty-eight weeks. 
The Lower Secondary should be so organized and ad- 
ministered as to make it possible for one who is preparing 
to enter the upper secondary to complete the curriculum in 
three years—whether others should take three or four or 
five years should depend on their individual needs and 
attainments. 
This report was adopted by the association. 
Professor Miller of the University of Wisconsin, 
principal of the Wisconsin High School, and Professor 
Proctor of Leland Stanford Junior University have

Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools, pp. 77-78.

more recently advocated an identical organization of 
these eight secondary-school years," the former pro- 
posing that the two resulting units bear the names now 
carried by the three-year units in the junior-senior 
organization. 
The first public secondary schools to be organized 
in accordance with this plan were those of Hibbing, 
Minnesota. The school system in that city had since 
the opening of the school-year in 1916 offered junior- 
college work. Junior high-school reorganization had 
also been effected. The coincidence of two influential 
facts precipitated the change resulting in the redistri- 
bution of grades referred to: the resignation of the 
high-school principal and the removal from the old 
building into a new plant designed to accommodate all 
students from the seventh through the fourteenth 
grade. A junior high-school principal was appointed 
from the staff and placed in charge of the first four of 
these eight grades. The dean of the junior college 
was made head of the upper unit of four years. In 
this way the complexity of a situation involving three 
distinct educational units under three codrdinate heads 
within the same secondary school was avoided. 
Other approaches to precedents in practice of which 
the writer is cognizant are the length and arrangement

of curricula in certain Southern junior colleges and the 
two-cycle arrangement in the French lycée. Some of 
these Southern private schools, in shifting from their 
previous organizations, retained the name “senior” 
for the last class (which is now on a par with the 
sophomores of ordinary colleges) and the three names 
“junior,” “sophomore,” and “freshman” for the three 
classes next below. The Grubbs Vocational College* 
and the John Tarleton Agricultural College, which are 
maintained as branches of the Agricultural and Me- 
chanical College of Texas, also have curricula of simi- 
lar length, students bearing the same classifications as 
those in the private institutions referred to. These 
four-year units correspond in length with the proposed 
senior high school. The French ’ cée is to some extent 
similar in that it is constituted of two cycles: the first, 
of four years ; the second, of three years. 
Some advantages of the organization proposed. A 
glance at the accepted special purposes of the junior 
college will show that this method of incorporating the 
junior-college years in the new secondary school is 
better designed to achieve some of the aims than is a 
three-three-two organization. This superiority would 
apply particularly to purposes 3, 4, 5,9, and 10. Cer- 
tain other benefits would accrue, some of which should 
at least be mentioned. Related to purposes 9 and 10 
would be the extent to which the plan will help to

  EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
solve the problems of articulating the several units of 
the system, and related in turn to this advantage is 
the opportunity for economy of time in the longer 
units in which this grouping results. This opportunity 
is anticipated in the quotation given above from the 
report of the committee of the North Central Associa- 
tion as well as in the proposals of Professors Miller 
and Proctor to which reference has been made. The 
economy suggested in both instances is the more rapid 
advancement of the more capable students. Such a 
consummation affords broad grounds for accepting 
as valid the claims classified in Chapter IT, as ‘‘caring 
better for brighter high-school students.” In view of 
the large extent of repetition shown in Chapter VIII 
and of an overlapping which must also obtain at other 
points in the full secondary-school period included, 
there is reason to believe that the typical length of 
stay can in time be shortened by a full year or even 
more, and that ultimately a seven-year or even a six- 
year secondary-school period will result. If this is not 
accomplished we shall cover more ground in the same 
time, enriching the extended secondary-school course, 
which is likewise a method of economizing time. 
Both these types of economy are being achieved 
simultaneously at the present time in the laboratory 
schools of the School of Education of the University 
of Chicago, which have been taking over some of the 
work of the junior-college years. The interested reader 
[ 363 ]

will find these economies described in brief as one of 
the major lines of experimentation of these schools 
on pages 17—19 in a recent publication of the Depart- 
ment of Education of the University entitled ‘Studies 
in Secondary Education—I.”* 
This plan, providing as it does a terminal four-year 
unit, would compensate for the tendency of the junior- 
college movement to break across the student’s four- 
year college course, a disruption deplored by those 
in charge of separate colleges. The four-year senior 
secondary-school unit will in time assure the desired 
continuity that will offset this loss—in fact, will more 
than offset it, since larger numbers will come to com- 
plete the full four-year curriculum than now remain 
throughout the college course. Although these values 
cannot be achieved at once, there is no occasion to 
fear that they are not ultimately attainable. 
The last of the special values inherent in the four- 
year organization to which attention is directed is that 
looked for by those whose statements were classified 
under special purpose 18 in Chapter II, “improving 
high-school instruction.” Some of the grounds for 
assurance on this score are the better teacher prepara- 
tion in subject matter that must follow in the wake of 
close association of the work in junior-college years

and the better laboratory, library, and other facilities 
that will be at hand for use in connection with these 
upper years of high-school work. At the same time 
the division into units at the point indicated, between 
the tenth and eleventh grades, will prevent that con- 
fusion of standards of work that sometimes now mani- 
fests itself because students in lower high-school and 
in junior-college years are too closely associated in the 
same educational unit. 
Four-year unit not necessarily an immediate step. 
Although the four-four organization recommended by 
this scrutiny as the more desirable one is to be kept in 
mind as the final goal of a reorganized secondary- 
school period, it need not be the next step in com- 
munities which have not yet had experience with 
junior-college work ; in fact, valid reasons can be given 
for first proceeding to establish units of the type now 
current, which provide at least a partial separation of 
the high school and the junior college. Among these 
reasons are the need of winning acceptance of the local 
constituency for the junior-college work provided. 
With our college-going traditions it is difficult at first 
to induce certain members of a community to believe 
that what they look upon as college work can really be 
given in a secondary school; and the maintenance for 
a time (at least until a new tradition of attendance at 
home has been established) of some lines of demarca- 
tion will assist in “selling” the work both to parents 
[ 365 ]

THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
and to students. The traditional separation is like- 
wise temporarily desirable in some high-school situa- 
tions in order to establish a satisfactory pace of 
scholarship on the part of the student. The trend 
must inevitably be, nevertheless, toward welding the 
junior-college years solidly and intimately to those 
immediately below, the point of juncture becoming 
indistinguishable. 
VII. THE Junior CoLLECE AND THE REMAINING 
CLAIMS MADE FOR IT 
Claims remaining undiscussed. Up to this point, 
directly or indirectly, all but a small number of the 
claims made on behalf of the junior college as reported 
in Chapter II have been subjected to examination in 
the light of such data as were obtainable for the pur- 
pose. Those still remaining undiscussed are claims 9, 
I1,20,and 21. These are, respectively, that it allows 
for exploration, that it makes the secondary-school 
period coincide with adolescence, that it offers work 
meeting local needs, and that it affects the cultural 
level of the local community. Brief comment will now 
be made on the acceptability of these as special pur- 
poses and on the relation between their achievement 
and the types of junior colleges. 
The exploratory function of junior-college years is 
probably to be accepted without debate. This is still 
a period during which students will make earlier con- 
[ 366 ]
-P-A-G-E-379
EVALUATING TYPES OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
tacts with materials of instruction that they have thus 
far in their school careers left untouched or have so 
inadequately explored as not to afford a sufficient basis 
of guidance as to future education and occupational 
destination. The admitted fact that these years of 
work are for most students enrolled in them a part of 
their general education implies that they are at the 
same time a part of the period in which educational and 
vocational guidance of this and other sorts is essential. 
In a significant sense the period of guidance is the 
period of secondary education, and, unfortunately, our 
present typical organization of education breaks across 
this period at two points, distributing the function to 
three distinct types of units. Our hope for adequate 
performance of the function must rest in bringing the 
responsibilities largely into a single period of the 
school system—the secondary. This will be possible 
with downward and upward extension of secondary 
education as here proposed. 
Evaluation of the claim that the junior college aids 
in making the secondary-school period coincide with 
adolescence is not so easily accomplished. The reason 
is that we know so little about the characteristics of 
this period of life. What we do know is more pertinent 
to its point of onset than to its point of termination, 
with which a discussion of the junior college would be 
concerned. Therefore we have a better factual basis 
for deciding when secondary education should begin 
[ 367 ]
-P-A-G-E-380
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
than when it should end, as far as it is to be determined 
by the period of adolescence. If the problem of the 
appropriate point for upper termination is broken up 
into the questions of when complete physical, mental, 
and social maturity arrives, and each of these is con- 
sidered separately, we are only a little better off. On 
the first question we have evidence that growth in 
height, weight, girth of chest, strength of forearms, 
etc. in girls slackens notably from the fourteenth to 
the sixteenth year. For boys the rapid increments 
extend beyond the typical ages of notable cessation 
for girls. 
This difference in the typical ages for the arrival 
of physical maturity in the two sexes tends to discredit 
the claim under consideration, since boys and girls 
arrive at particular grades in the secondary and higher 
schools at ages which, if not accurately equivalent, are 
at least approximately equivalent. The determination 
of the ages of arrival at mental and social maturity is 
so hedged about by difficulties that no statement can 
be ventured which is dependable and which will throw 
light on the problem of the proper point of termination 
for the secondary-school period. The best that can be 
done is to make a loose general statement that only a 
small proportion of students seem to be socially ma-

ture by the time of their graduation from high school, 
and that if higher education began with the third col- 
lege year instead of the first we should be dealing in 
universities with men and women rather than with 
boys and girls. 
Claim 20—offering work adapted to local needs— 
has some justification of acceptance in view of current 
junior-college offerings. In this respect the public 
junior college shows greater responsiveness than does 
the private institution. The last claim—influencing 
the cultural level of the local community—is admis- 
sible without extended argument, since the per- 
formance of this function is inherent in all worthy 
educational institutions. 
Although most of these additional claims have some 
validity, for the sake of keeping our problem as simple 
as possible they will not be placed in what has here 
been used as a working list of special purposes of the 
junior college. 
VIII. SuMMaRIZING THE EVALUATION OF THE TYPES 
OF JUNIOR COLLEGES 
The method of summary. A means of summariz- 
ing the foregoing evaluation of the several types of 
junior colleges is afforded in Fig. 45, which presents 
at the left, in somewhat abbreviated form, the special 
purposes accepted earlier in the chapter and at the 
head the types of institutions offering junior-college 
[ 369 ]

work. It will be noted that the latter includes the 
“large college or university.” The significant feature 
of the figure is that it shows the relationship of each 
type of institution to the achievement of each of the 
special purposes. The degrees of relationship are in- 
dicated by cross-hatching, by single-hatching, and by 
leaving in outline the intersections of the special pur- 
poses with the columns under the types of institutions. 
Cross-hatching signifies a high degree of assurance of 
achieving a special purpose; single-hatching, a mod- 
erate but not high degree of assurance ; space in out- 
line, relatively little or no assurance. For example, we 
have a high degree of assurance that the first part of 
purpose 1—giving the first two years of liberal-arts 
curricula—can be performed in all the types of insti- 
tutions represented. The degree indicated has been 
determined by the facts given in this report and by the 
evaluation attempted in this chapter. The writer feels 
that only occasionally if at all can exception be taken 
to the degrees of relationship shown. Disagreement 
’ could at most be on a few purposes only and for but a 
single step in the gradation of relationships. 
A few comments of a miscellaneous character will 
be made before summarizing the results of the com- 
parison afforded. It should be noted that for Fig. 45 
the two aspects of purpose 1 are separately considered. 
Reference has already been made to the fact that pur- 
poses 1 and 2 are not to be looked upon as essentially

“special” or distinctive of the junior college, but that 
the likelihood of their effective performance is so vital 
to the pertinence of the remaining functions that it is 
desirable to retain them in the list. Although junior- 
college units on state foundations other than those 
maintained in connection with normal schools and 
teachers’ colleges are not given separate consideration 
in the figure, the judgments rendered on the normal- 
school type are almost as applicable. The exceptions 
would tend to be for purposes 3, 4, and 5, for which 
the degree of relationship might justifiably be raised 
to the next higher step. 
Results of the comparison. The continuity of cross- 
hatching in the columns of spaces for the public junior 
college in Fig. 45 indicates a high degree of assurance 
of its achievement of all the special purposes in the 
accepted list. The possibility of achieving all these 
purposes is not so complete for the private and the 
normal-school types, although one or the other of the 
two highest degrees of relationship is judged to apply 
in all but the last two special purposes. Emphasis has 
already been laid upon the desirability of assuring the 
achievement of these two purposes because of their 
profoundly significant bearing on the full meaning of 
the junior-college movement; reorganization would 
be inadequate indeed if it did not provide for their 
complete performance. The large proportion of un- 
shaded spaces in the column headed ‘Large college or

university” calls attention again to the ineptitude of 
the typical present-day organization to the require- 
ments of the situation. Only with reference to pur- 
poses x and 2, which have already been indicated as 
less distinctive of the junior college, do we find a high 
degree of assurance of achievement. It may be worth 
mentioning that if the type of unit here considered 
were the “small college” and not the large college or 
university the only additional purpose that would 
come in for recognition would be purpose 7—afford- 
ing more attention to the individual student.

THE PROBLEMS OF LOCATION AND 
MAINTENANCE 
I. THE Source oF THE STUDENT-Bopy 
The problems. A conclusion with reference to the 
type of junior college to be fostered having been 
reached, the problem settles down to a question of 
where such units should be established. This in turn 
resolves itself into subproblems, two of which are of 
major concern: (1) the source of the student-body ; 
(2) adequately financing the work. The second will 
be attacked in section II of this chapter ; the first will 
be given consideration in this section. The particular 
question to be answered may be put as follows: How 
large must be the enrollment of a high school and the 
population of the community which it serves, in order 
that junior-college work may be established with 
assurance that the requisite student-body will be at 
hand to avail themselves of its opportunities ? 
The data utilized concern the numbers of graduates 
of high schools located for the most part in the north- 
central states who have enrolled in the first two years 
of higher institutions. It was believed best to secure 
[374]

LOCATION AND MAINTENANCE 
the bulk of the data from a single section of the coun- 
try, in order to make certain, as nearly as possible, 
that the conclusions should be adequate for the pur- 
poses to which they are put. The facts used were 
ascertained by means of an inquiry blank directed to 
the principals of high schools in communities repre- 
senting a wide range of population—from small vil- 
lages to cities in which there are no colleges and to 
those in which there are a small number of such 
higher institutions. The latter were included in order 
to determine the influence of the presence of higher 
institutions on the proportions of high-school gradu- 
ates likely to attend them. The items of information 
asked for were the figures on enrollment during the 
academic years 1920-1921 or 1921-1922* by years 
(first or second years of higher institutions only), by 
sex, and by lines of work (“regular college work,” 
pre-medical, pre-legal, the several engineering groups, 
architecture, dentistry, pharmacy, business, normal, 
education, agriculture, home economics, music, and 
other arts; blank spaces were provided for reporting 
the enrollment in other lines). Among other data 
requested was the enrollment of the high schools

title “ Where to Establish Junior Colleges” in the School Review, Vol.XXIX, 
PP. 414-433 (June, 1921). This study concerned enrollments for the school 
year 1920-1921 and pertained to high schools in the north-central states. 
For the purposes of this chapter the study was extended to include addi- 
tional schools in this section as well as in other parts of the United States. 
All additional data are for the school year 1921-1922.

(Grades 9 to 12) for the year in which the report was 
made. Principals were asked to include in their report 
all their graduates “‘who are this year enrolled . . . 
irrespective of the year of graduation from the high 
school.” For the purposes of the study a higher in- 
stitution was defined as “‘one which requires for admis- 
sion high-school graduation or its essential equivalent 
in earned units of credit.” Approximately 250 of the 
blanks of inquiry were returned with data of some 
sort; 194 proved usable. Conclusions will be drawn 
almost exclusively from the 111 of these from high 
schools in the north-central states. 
The distribution by lines of work. A total of 8885 
graduates of all the 194 high schools represented in 
the study are enrolled in the first two years of work in 
higher institutions—an average of about 46 per high 
school. This large number is widely distributed as to 
the lines of work being followed. “Liberal arts” as 
here tabulated includes those in regular college work 
as well as pre-medical, pre-legal, and education (not 
normal-school) students. It is by far the largest 
group, including 5114, or almost three fifths of the 
total. For the problem in hand the significance of this 
predominance of students in liberal arts is in the direc- 
tion of simplifying the task of providing in the junior 
college the work suited to the needs of those who are 
going on. The five other lines enrolling notably large 
numbers of students are, in order of predominance, 
[376]

LOCATION AND MAINTENANCE 
normal, engineering, business or pre-business, agricul- 
ture, and home economics. The percentages of the 
totals in these lines are, respectively, 14.6, 9.5, 5.8, 2.8, 
and 2.4. 
Enrollment in higher institutions asrelated to the 
size of high schools. The relationship between the 
numbers of graduates enrolled in the first two years of 
higher institutions and the high-school enrollment has 
been studied by computing the percentages of the 
former to the latter and then computing the average 
percentages after the high schools havé been grouped 
by size. For this purpose high schools in communities 
in which there are no colleges or universities have been 
separated from those in which there are such institu- 
tions, to make possible a comparison of the percent- 
ages for these two groups. The percentages found 
demonstrate an interesting similarity for high schools 
of widely different enrollments, since they do not 
range beyond limits set by 10.6 and 12.8 per cent. 
For the twenty high schools in communities with 
local higher institutions the average is 17.3, whereas 
the average for the group without a local higher insti- 
tution is 11.8. This means that on the average the 
presence of a local higher institution adds more than 
two fifths and well up toward a half to the proportion 
of the high-school enrollment represented by gradu- 
ates who attend a higher institution—a fact of large 
significance in establishing junior-college work.

Some corroboration of the validity of this finding is 
supplied by another approach to the estimate of the 
proportion of the high-school enrollment to be found 
in the first two years of higher institutions if junior- 
college work is established in connection with a high 
school. This is made possible by utilizing the per- 
centages of students enrolled in each of the four years 
of large high schools on the accredited lists of the 
North Central Association as ascertained by Davis.* 
These percentages for the years from the first through

the fourth are, respectively, 39.98, 27.69, 18.64, and 
13.67. This means that at the time of making the 
study 67.7 per cent were enrolled in the first two years 
and the remainder, 32.3 per cent, in the last two years. 
Assuming that the enrollment in an upward extension 
of two years in these high schools would bear the same 
relationship to the enrollment in the last two years as 
the latter does to the enrollment of the first two years, 
then from the proportionate relationship 67.7 :32.3:: 
32.3:% we obtain x =15.4 per cent. This is seen to 
approximate the percentage found for high schools in 
communities with local higher institutions. There are 
grounds for assurance, therefore, that after the junior- 
college idea is fully accepted the proportion of the 
high-school enrollment represented by graduates en- 
rolled in the local junior-college unit would not often 
be less than a sixth. 
Enrollment in higher institutions as related to local 
population. A second relationship of significance is 
that of the numbers and proportions of the total popu- 
lations of the cities represented by those of the high- 
school graduates who are enrolled in the work of the 
first two years in higher institutions. The figures are 
taken from the 1920 census. The average numbers in 
each thousand of the population thus enrolled show a 
marked tendency to equivalence, except for the groups 
of smallest and largest communities represented ; that 
is, those with less than two thousand and those with 
[379 ]
-P-A-G-E-392
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
more than fifteen thousand. For the four groups with 
population lying between these figures the averages 
range only from 4.6 to 6.3 per thousand of the popula- 
tion. Forthe smaller communities the average is some- 
what higher. On the other hand there is a somewhat 
smaller average proportion in communities of fifteen 
thousand and over. This situation is in harmony with 
that found when proportions of the population en- 
rolled in high schools have been computed, and there- 
fore seems attributable to the same causes. One of 
these is the fact that nonresident enrollment in small 
high schools is larger proportionately than in large 
urban high schools. 
Again, the distribution of the figures for communi- 
ties in which there are higher institutions is toward the 
larger proportions; the average of the proportions is 
10.9 in each thousand of the population. This is a 
difference of 5.3 per thousand, or an increase of about 
95 per cent, owing to the presence of the local higher 
institutions. 
The minimum junior-college unit. At other places 
in this volume data are presented which provide a 
basis for arriving at a minimum approvable junior- 
college student-body. One determinative relationship 
is that of cost per student as canvassed in subsequent 
sections of this chapter. Data there presented indi- 
cate that this cost is likely to run unreasonably high 
for units which do not enroll as many as from one 
[ 380 ]
-P-A-G-E-393
  LOCATION AND MAINTENANCE 
hundred and fifty to two hundred students. Another 
important consideration is the restrictions that must 
be placed upon the curricular offering in units enroll- 
ing less than this number of students. The desirable 
minimal offerings have been given attention in Chap- 
ter III and are so extended as to discourage the es- 
tablishment of units enrolling less than the larger 
number of students referred to. The discourage- 
ment is in part that of high costs and in part that of 
classes too small to provide the emulation necessary 
to effective scholarship. Again, it was shown in 
Chapter IV that without enrollments of good size 
it will be out of the question to provide in the junior 
colleges instructors with adequate specialization in 
certain essential fields. Another consideration in sup- 
port of sizable units is the restrictions upon the 
socializing value of attendance if total enrollments 
are too small to provide a wide variety of student 
contacts. The tentative minimum accepted for con- 
sideration here is two hundred students. It is not 
assumed that experience may not in time lead to 
the approval of a smaller number, nor that inaccessi- 
bility of opportunities for higher education may not 
recommend occasional units that are marked excep- 
tions, just as it sometimes justifies the establishment 
of very small high-school units. Present indications 
are, however, that enrollments should extend from 
two hundred students upward. 
[ 381 ]
-P-A-G-E-394
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
The size of high-school enrollment and of popula- 
tion assuring feasibility. Assuming a minimum unit 
of two hundred students and a proportion enrolling in 
any local junior college equal to a sixth of the high- 
school registration, it becomes apparent that if all 
students were drawn from the graduates of any local 
high school the enrollment in the latter would need to 
be in the neighborhood of 1200students. Bonnershows 
that in 1917—1918, of almost 14,000 high schools in 
the United States reporting, only 278 enrolled more 
than 1000 students.* Since we are, for the sake of illus- 
tration, giving particular attention to the north-central 
states, it should be stated that of this number slightly 
less than 100 (98, to be exact) were in this region— 
less than 100 in a total of 6618 reporting. Recent ten- 
dencies toward an increase in high-school attendance 
have without doubt brought this number well up above 
the century mark, but their relative infrequency in a 
territory as large as that represented, extending from 
Ohio to Nebraska and from Minnesota and North 
Dakota to Missouri and Oklahoma, makes it clear that 
if junior colleges were established only in connection 
with high schools having enrollments of 1000 or more 
this region would not be well served by them. 
The proportion of the population enrolled in the 
first two college years is not as constant as is the ratio 
of those so enrolled to the high-school enrollment.

  LOCATION AND MAINTENANCE 
Whatever may be the causes, there is an observable 
decline in the proportions by size of cities in proceed- 
ing from those of smaller population to those of larger 
population. On this account and because the study 
does not include data touching very large populations, 
it is impossible on the basis of populations to predict 
with as much certainty as in the foregoing instance 
whether a minimum student-body of two hundred will 
be at hand. There is, however, a sufficient basis of 
assurance in the materials to warrant the attempt. It 
has already been indicated that the proportion of 
the population attending is practically doubled by the 
presence of a local higher institution. Accepting the 
proportion in cities of 15,000 and over which are with- 
out higher institutions as 2.7 per 1000, this means that 
the proportion would rise to something like 5 or 6 per 
1000 in cities of this size with local colleges. A popu- 
lation of 35,000 to 40,000 would therefore be required 
if the total enrollment of two hundred junior-college 
students were to be drawn from within the city of 
location only. Because of the inconstancy of the pro- 
portion as shown, the feasible minimum population 
might in some instances drop to 25,000 or 30,000, 
whereas in others it would rise above 40,000. 
The census figures for 1920 show for the north- 
central states a total of ninety-eight cities with popula- 
tions of twenty-five thousand and over. By checking 
over the list of cities it is found that approximately 
[ 383 ]
-P-A-G-E-396
THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
half of them are already provided with one or more 
higher institutions of one sort or another. Although 
this fact would not always remove the desirability 
of establishing junior-college work in such cities, it 
would, owing to the draft of the institution already in 
existence upon the potential junior-college student- 
body, tend to discount the feasibility of the junior- 
college work. 
A study, not to be reported here in detail, designed 
to ascertain the average percentages of the populations 
of cities represented by those enrolled in high schools, 
affords support for the conclusion that cities with a 
population of 35,000 to 40,000 are likely to have high- 
school enrollments approximating 1100 or 1200. This 
indicates a likelihood that communities meeting the 
requirements of population as just set will be identical 
with those having high schools with the requisite 
enrollments, and vice versa. 
It may be gratuitous to emphasize the fact that the 
rough prediction here made is based for the most part 
on central tendencies and that in many particular 
situations deviation from it is to be anticipated. The 
variation leads to the admission, for instance, that 
there will be some high schools with enrollments of 
II0O or 1200 or communities with populations of 
35,000 to 40,000 from which it will not be possible to 
recruit the desirable minimum of two hundred stu- 
dents for junior-college work. On the other hand, the 
[ 384 ]
-P-A-G-E-397
  LOCATION AND MAINTENANCE 
same variation makes clear that there will be high 
schools with smaller enrollments and communities of 
smaller populations where this minimum may be 
secured. 
Junior colleges in smaller high schools and commu- 
nities. It is clear that insistence that the junior college 
of practicable size must draw its students exclusively 
or almost exclusively from the city where it is located 
would be certain, to a large extent, to place the move- 
ment beyond the pale of serious consideration. How- 
ever, since most colleges and universities, whether on 
public or private foundations, draw large proportions 
of their students from without their communities of 
location, we have a precedent of long standing to 
justify us in planning a system of public junior colleges 
that will make up their minimum student-body of two 
hundred in considerable part from beyond the imme- 
diate environs. The writer has elsewhere* presented 
data showing the percentages of students who had 
enrolled in the first two years of certain Mid-Western 
colleges and who reported as their residences the com- 
munities in which the institutions are located. An 
examination of these percentages for the fourteen col- 
leges located in cities with populations ranging from 
10,139 to 71,227 shows them to lie between the limits

of 5.1 and 57.7. The median percentage for this group 
is 37.7. This means that the median percentage of 
students from outside the city of location is 62.3, some- 
what short of two thirds. There is no reason to believe 
that an efficient state system of junior colleges prop- 
erly located would be unable to draw an equally large 
proportion from outside. But there are vital reasons 
why such a state system should aim at so placing these 
units that a majority at least of the students can live 
at home while they are in attendance. Among these 
reasons are the advantages of lowered cost, which has 
been shown to be a powerful factor in democratizing 
higher education (see Chapter V) and which should 
be kept in mind in planning a system of junior colleges. 
Another is the more youthful age at which students 
under such circumstances will enter upon the work of 
these school years (see Chapter VI). 
If as large a proportion as an approximate half (or 
a bare majority) of the minimum desirable junior- 
college student-body could be drawn from other high 
schools and from beyond the limits of the local com- 
munity, it would markedly lower the point of feasi- 
bility of establishing junior colleges. It would cut in 
half the necessary high-school enrollment of 1200, re- 
ducing it to something like 600. Average proportions 
lead us to expect that in cities with populations of 
10,000 to 15,000 the number enrolled in junior-college 
years in each 1000 of the population would be approxi-

mately 9. This in turn means that a majority of the 
minimum desirable student-body would be likely to 
be at hand in cities of 12,000 population or there- 
abouts, although on account of the larger variation 
from community to community this measure has less 
of predictive value than the proportion of the high- 
school enrollment that will go on. 
Lowering the point of feasibility by assuming only 
a majority of students from the local high school and 
the local community increases, of course, the numbers 
of communities in which introduction of junior-college 
work could be justified. Referring again to Bonner,” 
we find that if we include with the 98 high schools in 
the north-central states which have enrollments of 
more than 1000 those with enrollments ranging from 
551 to 1000, this increases the total number to 214, 
more than double. Similarly, adding to the number of 
cities with populations of 25,000 and over in the same 
states those with populations between 10,000 and 
25,000 brings the total up to 256, whereas the group 
of larger cities included only 98. Although only a 
careful study of the distribution of the high schools 
and cities represented could indicate how well the 
region would be served by junior colleges established 
in them, the total numbers are sufficiently large to 
warrant the belief that enough of such high schools

and cities are available to assure adequate systems of 
junior-college units in most states. 
It should be of interest to note in passing that two 
states— Michigan and California—have passed laws 
attempting to regulate the location of junior colleges 
in such a way as to have some bearing on the problem 
of the source of the student-body. In Michigan any 
school district having a population of more than thirty 
thousand may provide two years of collegiate work. 
The California statute insists that high-school enroll- 
ments in districts maintaining junior colleges be not 
less than four hundred.* Whether the former restric- 
tion was placed with the intent to assure an ade- 
quate student-body or adequate support, or both, is 
not clear. 
Junior colleges not now attracting and holding all 
local high-school graduates who go on. An assumption 
underlying the foregoing predictions is that all gradu- 
ates of high schools who go on to higher levels of train- 
ing would attend a local junior college during the first 
two years. It should be frankly admitted that such an 
assumption does not accord with the facts in the pres- 
ent state of development of junior colleges. The situa- 
tion in this regard may be illustrated by stating that

for thirteen public junior colleges for which data were 
available the percentages of the high-school graduates 
going on who attend the local junior college ranged 
from 37.8 to 95.8—from three eighths to almost all. 
The lower percentages indicate that in some junior 
colleges the proportion falls far below the assumption 
referred to. At the other extreme, however, there are 
junior colleges which attract almost all who continue 
their education. The average percentage for all thir- 
teen units was 70.6. It is manifest that if the predic- 
tion as made is to be realized, junior colleges must all 
come to hold at least as large a proportion as the 
highest reported. 
The public junior colleges at the present time fall 
short of the assumption in one additional respect— 
the proportion of first-year students held into the sec- 
ond year. This fact became apparent in a comparison 
of the percentages of retention into the second year in 
public junior colleges and four-year colleges of the 
Middle West. The average proportions in junior col- 
leges was as low as a half of the total or slightly less, 
women being retained somewhat better than men. In 
the four-year colleges the percentage of retention was 
nearer two thirds. 
Both types of facts just presented—those showing 
that the new unit draws less than the total number of 
those who go on to higher levels of training and those 
indicating the relatively small proportion of students

remaining for the second junior-college year—are evi- 
dence that the movement is not yet thoroughly estab- 
lished. It takes time and effort to win acceptance of 
a new institution or to place it on a foundation that 
will justify its holding all students who go on through 
two years of residence. Even if we set aside for the 
moment the question whether all necessary work is 
now going forward in these new units, it must be ad- 
mitted that only after some years can the new unit 
become a part of the educational tradition of all the 
possible constituency. This is the experience, of 
course, of every novelty and must be especially charac- 
teristic where the older traditions of “college life” are 
prevalent inacommunity. It will be difficult for some 
people to associate even a part of what they regard as 
the period of collegiate training with the secondary 
unit below. These persons will be prone to look upon 
the movement disparagingly because it is an upward 
extension of the high school. In such a situation there 
will be among both parents and potential junior- 
college students those who either will not look with 
favor upon attendance to any extent or will counte- 
nance at most a single further year in such an institu- 
tion. A second factor must be the meager curricular 
offerings in some of the junior-college units. With 
little in the way of option and a much more restricted 
range of courses available in the second year than in 
the first, the former factor of a lack of understanding

or appreciation of the junior-college movement has 
something at least in its support. 
These factors are, however, not permanently in- 
herent in the situation. It has previously been indi- 
cated that some junior colleges have already been 
able to remove these obstacles almost entirely. There 
is no occasion to fear that, given sizable junior-college 
units on state foundations and with generous curricu- 
lar offerings meeting the requirements of a wide va- 
riation in the student-body, these obstacles should 
not be entirely removed and predictions of the sort 
made at an earlier point in the chapter become 
completely realizable. To attract such numbers and 
proportions as have been predicted it will not be 
necessary to provide in the junior college all the lines 
of specialization previously mentioned, for students 
will gravitate toward the curricular materials avail- 
able. At the same time such an offering could not 
be restricted to the first two years of work in colleges 
of liberal arts. Some opportunities of differentiation 
must be provided, such as engineering, business, home 
economics, etc. There is, again, no occasion to doubt 
that under such circumstances these junior-college 
units would attract practically all students ready for 
work on this level, just as the public high school in 
most of our communities has come to draw to it all or 
almost all students who enroll in work on the tradi- 
tional secondary-school level.

The point of feasibility likely to lower. It is much 
more likely that a lowering of the point of feasibility 
as measured by the size of the high-school enrollment 
and of the population will take place than that any- 
_ thing more than temporary obstacles to the realization 
of the predictions will arise. As all those conversant 
with the situation in secondary and higher education 
are aware, high-school and college attendance has 
been gaining rapidly on the population during several 
decades. If junior colleges become at all common in 
our school system, even more rapidly increasing num- 
bers and proportions will avail themselves of the 
opportunities afforded. This will be due to the rising 
tide of popular education itself, to sheer availability, 
as already indicated, to the public character of the 
institution, and to the tendency that must come to 
merge the high school and the junior college. The in- 
crease in attendance will be accompanied by an en- 
richment of curricula in these years, and this in turn 
will accelerate the increase.

Why and how studied. As admitted at the opening 
of the chapter, the establishment of a system of junior 
colleges is not merely a problem of securing a sizable 
student-body but is also one of adequately financing 
the work. To some this requirement may seem the

more important of the two, and there are excellent 
grounds for such a conviction. 
Although there can be no endeavor here to make a 
complete canvass of all financial aspects of junior- 
college establishment and maintenance, the volume 
could not be regarded as complete without giving some 
attention to the fiscal aspects of providing the work. 
This section will therefore present materials bearing 
on the teaching-cost in junior colleges, the total cost 
per student, the burden that would need to be carried 
by a local community providing the work if the cost is 
borne entirely by such community, the relationship 
of this burden to that already being carried by commu- 
nities of different populations to support education on 
lower levels, and inferences from these financial data 
toward an appropriate procedure in fostering the 
movement. 
The problem of cost to the student or the person 
bearing the burden of expense for his attendance will 
not be considered here, as it has been scrutinized in 
Chapter V. 
Teaching-cost. It was possible to secure from as 
many as fifteen public junior colleges visited enough 
data to compute the annual cost of teaching per stu- 
dent enrolled. Although the figures on average cost 
are not to be regarded as fully accurate, they are suf- 
ficiently so to warrant the confidence that they are at 
least approximate. The method of computing aver-

age cost was simple. It consisted merely in obtaining 
the total cost of junior-college teaching and dividing 
it by the number of students enrolled.* 
The average cost of instruction ranges as widely as 
from $83.26 to $223.54, the highest being almost 2.7 
times as great as the lowest. A tendency for lowered 
costs with increased enrollments is shown in the fol- 
lowing arrangement of average costs:

1The standard practice in such computations is to divide by the num- 
ber of students in average daily attendance. If this method had been fol- 
lowed here, the number of junior colleges represented would have been 
reduced because of the difficulty in securing data on average daily attend- 
ance in some units. 
[ 394]

In this arrangement the numbers in each of the three 
groups are seen to be one, five, and nine respectively. 
In the groups of medium and small junior colleges the 
arrangement is again from least to greatest average 
cost, the middle case being indicated in italics. The 
median cost in the group of smallest units is more than 
1.5 times the median cost in the group of units of 
medium size. 
The wide variations within each group may be 
ascribed primarily to the influence of the salary paid 
to junior-college teachers. This may be illustrated 
for junior colleges A and N, which had enrollments 
respectively of ninety and one hundred and twelve; 
that is, approximately equal. The difference in aver- 
age teaching-costs in these two units is that between 
$83.26 and $216.89; and it is a difference determined 
for the most part by a large difference in salaries paid, 
although it is also to some extent attributable to the 
more extended offering and consequently smaller 
classes in junior college N. The same factors account 
for the difference between average teaching-costs in 
junior colleges E and M, which have almost equivalent 
enrollments. 
After making a number of experimental computa- 
tions of average annual costs and of average costs per 
student-hour, assuming enrollments of varying sizes 
and salary schedules just as high as, or somewhat 
higher than, those paid for the same work in four-year

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
colleges, to make it possible to compete for teachers 
with such institutions, the writer has concluded that 
satisfactory instruction can be provided at from $115 
to $135 per student enrolled per year and that a tenta- 
tive middle figure, variable to a considerable extent 
above and below, is $125. To make such a figure pos- 
sible, however, it is necessary to keep the minimum 
enrollment at something like one hundred and fifty to 
two hundred students. As the enrollment drops below 
this minimum the average annual cost of teaching 
must rise, so that a comparison of costs with those for 
the same work in other standard higher institutions 
is less favorable to the new unit. By keeping the offer- 
ing meager, large classes would be encouraged and the 
average cost be kept low, but such a practice would 
itself militate against the maximum enrollment. The 
assumption in the matter of breadth of work offered 
is a practice no less generous than that suggested in 
Chapter ITI. 
The writer admitted in the first section of this chap- 
ter that certain special considerations, such as the 
relative inaccessibility of opportunities for education 
on this level, will sometimes justify providing junior- 
college work to smaller numbers than the typical 
minimum suggested, much as we sometimes defend a 
similar provision of opportunities of education on the 
high-school level for smaller numbers in remote terri- 
tory. Such provisions should be made, however, with 
[ 396 ]
-P-A-G-E-409
LOCATION AND MAINTENANCE 
a full understanding of what they mean in additional 
cost per student. In the long run we cannot defend 
an average annual teaching-cost very much greater 
than that for which the same education can be given 
in the larger educational units now in existence, al- 
though in view of the lowered cost to the student who 
can attend near home some increase in annual cost will 
at times be defensible. 
To ascertain teaching-costs is a simple matter when 
compared with obtaining other costs of providing 
education on the junior-college level. In few if any 
systems in which junior-college work is maintained 
are there anything like satisfactory methods of school 
accounting which attempt to separate the junior- 
college costs along nonteaching lines from those for 
other parts of the system. Even where this separation 
is attempted the practices vary enough to prevent 
comparison from unit to unit. 
Although this situation is discouraging as concerns 
the complete analysis of the financial problems of 
instituting and maintaining the work, access was had 
to sufficient pertinent data to justify a fairly depend- 
able estimate of nonteaching costs per student in units 
of the size approved in the foregoing section as a de- 
sirable minimum. The method of presentation to be 
used will be that of illustrating the computation for a 
single junior college (F), one of the units in southern 
California with an enrollment approximately a fourth 
[397]  
-P-A-G-E-410

smaller than that approved as a desirable minimum. 
It is a part of the school system in a city with a popula- 
tion and high-school enrollment not far from adequate 
when measured by standards applied in foregoing por- 
tions of the chapter. Although the results of the com- 
putations are not to be regarded as accurate, they are 
sufficiently so to warrant their use in connection with 
the problem here under consideration. 
All items of cost are as follows:

The estimate for teaching-cost, it will be noted, is not 
that for junior college F as reported but that tenta- 
tively arrived at as necessary in public junior colleges. 
The items other than teaching will require some 
explanation. Other instructional covers expenditures 
for special salary additions for the services of the dean, 
apportionment of the salary of a registrar serving both 
high school and junior college, printing, apportion- 
ment of expenditures for the library used in common 
by high-school and junior-college students, and similar 
apportionment of general and consumable instruc-

tional supplies. General control is synonymous with 
overhead expenses—the superintendent’s salary and 
the expenses of his office, maintenance of offices of the 
Board of Education, etc. The amount charged to the 
junior college was determined by the proportion of 
its enrollment to the total in all public schools of 
the district. Operation of plant covers fuel, light and 
power, water, janitors, janitors’ supplies, and tele- 
phones; maintenance, the repairs on buildings and 
grounds ; fixed charges, insurance ; auxiliary agencies, 
medical inspection etc. 
One of the most important costs, and at the same 
time one of the most perplexing items to compute, is 
that for the provision of the plant in which the junior- 
college work is to be carried on, especially when it is 
required to put this expense in terms of the cost per 
year. The steps in the present attempt to arrive at 
an approximate figure are as follows: (1) ascertaining 
the total value of the housing and equipment in com- 
mon use by the high school and junior college, (2) 
computing the portion of this capital outlay which 
may properly be assumed to be assigned to the use of 
the junior college, and (3) computing the annual cost 
per student per year to cover this portion of the capital 
outlay and the quota of the interest charge during the 
period over which the payments on capital extend. 
From figures concerning the amount and the propor- 
tion of insurance protection and supplementary esti- 
[ 399 ]
-P-A-G-E-412
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
mates of value it is safe to put the value of the housing 
and equipment under consideration at $450,000. This 
is exclusive of the value of the site, which would hardly 
differ in size if no junior college were being main- 
tained. On the basis of the proportion of space used, 
as followed in the instances of certain other items of 
cost, 13.97 per cent, or $62,865, of this outlay is for 
the junior college. A prevalent practice in payment 
will be assumed ; that is, that bonds are issued for this 
sum and that equal parts of the indebtedness will be 
discharged each year for thirty years—the probable 
period of usefulness of the building. Since the rate of 
interest on most bonds issued by this district is 5 per 
cent, the interest at this rate on all unpaid balances 
must be included as a part of the total outlay for the 
plant for the junior-college unit. This interest is the 
equivalent of 5 per cent per year for fifteen years, or 
75 per cent of $62,865, so that a total interest charge 
of $47,148.75 must be paid by the district. This in 
turn will require during the thirty-year period a total 
expenditure of $110,013.75 for the plant, which is 
equivalent to $3667.12 per year, or $24.61 per stu- 
dent per year. Should such a community see fit to 
pay the full cost of such a building by one large tax 
levy at the time of construction, the virtual cost of 
housing and equipping the junior college would be as 
just computed, because, although not actually paying 
an interest charge, the taxpayers are deprived of the 
[ 400 ]
-P-A-G-E-413
  
  LOCATION AND MAINTENANCE 
use of the amount they have invested, this amount de- 
creasing of course as the plant depreciates. Although 
it may be argued that the estimated cost per student 
per year is probably high because the life of well- 
constructed buildings is likely to run beyond the limit 
of thirty years, it is easily conceivable that costs of 
construction in certain sections of the country where 
heavier walls must be built will tend to keep the aver- 
age somewhere in the vicinity of this figure. 
It is to be noted that the total for all items is 
$187.65. From what has been said of the conserva- 
tive character of the estimates on certain items it does 
not appear to be especially hazardous to assume that 
in cities of the size represented a reasonable approxi- 
mate average cost over all per student is $185, with a 
division of something like $125 for teaching-items and 
the remaining $60 for nonteaching-items. It is easy 
to conceive of situations in which this average cost 
will and should rise to $200 or beyond, with $135 for 
teaching-items and $65 for nonteaching-items. A safe 
range of cost where conditions are satisfactory is 
probably somewhere between $175 and a little more 
than $200. 
To those who have been in actual contact with the 
movement to establish junior colleges in particular 
communities it will long before this have occurred that 
most persons who have urged this expansion have not 
referred to the items of cost other than 1 and 2 in 
[ 401 ]
-P-A-G-E-414
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
the foregoing list, except perhaps to point out that 
in the initial stages the district would by such estab- 
lishment be put to no additional outlay for items 
like 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. And, let it be said on be- 
half of these advocates of the junior college, there 
is seldom if ever real misrepresentation of the situa- 
tion at the time financial feasibility is discussed in this 
way. Usually a small unit only is contemplated at 
first, one which can be accommodated with small addi- 
tions to the teaching staff, with only minor increases 
in instructional facilities, and without significant addi- 
tions to overhead costs or an enlargement of space 
provisions that would involve further cost in opera- 
tion, maintenance, etc. It has been fortunate during 
earlier experimental stages of the movement that be- 
ginnings under these relatively inexpensive conditions 
have been possible. 
But this facility of initiating the movement should 
not prevent our being alert to all the aspects of finan- 
cial responsibility involved when a unit is well estab- 
lished and of a size not far from that proposed as a 
desirable minimum. In most situations, long before’ 
a junior-college student-body of this size can be as- 
sembled the high-school student-body with which it is 
associated will have outgrown all the space used by 
the junior college. The provision of additional space 
will therefore be necessary, and this in turn is certain 
to increase the cost of operation, maintenance, fixed

-P-A-G-E-415

charges, auxiliary agencies, and plant replacement. 
Such increases must in time affect also the cost of 
general control. Certainly if a state system of junior 
colleges is contemplated, the neglect of noninstruc- 
tional factors of cost will eventually militate against 
the efficiency of the plan or, at least, against the will- 
ingness of communities to bear the junior-college 
burden. 
Curricular distribution of students. The estimate 
of junior-college costs per student was worked out 
without special reference to students pursuing or 
intending to pursue professional or preprofessional 
curricula during these two collegiate years. A con- 
siderable number of students in several of the junior 
colleges represented were registered for work pertain- 
ing to such curricula, but it was not possible to con- 
sider specifically the extent to which providing the 
courses they need affects the average cost per student. 
It is correct to assume, however, that the proportion 
is smaller than that which would be found in any ran- 
dom sampling of students enrolled in the first two 
years of work in all types of higher institutions. 
A study of the proportionate distribution to the 
several lines of work of 63,724 students enrolled dur- 
ing 1919—1920 in a dozen Western and Mid-Western 
universities warrants the expectation that from two 
thirds to seven tenths must during their first two years 
pursue curricula falling within the liberal-arts field. 
[ 403 ]
-P-A-G-E-416
  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
To arrive at this proportion, there have been added to 
the percentage in liberal arts proper those in graduate 
departments and schools of law, medicine, dentistry, 
education, divinity, journalism, and library training, 
all of which will soon, if in essence they do not already, 
prescribe work in liberal-arts lines during at least the 
first two years in college. This proportion is almost 
identical with that found for the liberal-arts group in 
the distribution of students referred to earlier in this 
chapter. A total of 8885 graduates of one hundred 
and ninety-four high schools who were going on to 
higher institutions were there concerned, of whom 
1297 were enrolled in normal schools. Of the 7588 re- 
maining, slightly more than two thirds were enrolled in 
liberal-arts groups, including pre-medical, pre-legal, 
and education. The findings seem to warrant the be- 
lief that under normal conditions, and with a satis- 
factory offering available, not far from two thirds to 
seven tenths of a junior-college student-body can be 
expected to enroll in liberal-arts courses or lines closely 
related ; the remainder—a third or less—will register 
in other special curricula provided. This means that 
for the desirable minimum of two hundred students 
proposed, somewhat less than one hundred and fifty 
will be enrolled in liberal-arts or general curricula, the 
remainder in specialized curricula. 
Guidance in the precedence to be given in providing 
these specialized curricula is afforded to some extent 
[ 404 ]
-P-A-G-E-417

by the proportionate registration in such curricula. 
First would come the engineering group, enrolling 
approximately a seventh of the total of 63,724 stu- 
dents ; next in order would come (to mention only the 
courses more frequently elected) commerce, with a 
tenth of the student-body, agriculture with a six- 
teenth, and home economics. 
The most important conclusion from these distri- 
butions is that since the estimated cost per student is 
based on a student-body rather largely in the liberal- 
arts group as here classified, it is to be regarded as 
pertinent for the overwhelming majority of the prob- 
able junior-college enrollment. A second conclusion, 
in the nature of a corollary, is that the proportion of 
other than liberal-arts students is relatively small and 
cannot therefore bring the average cost far above the 
estimate ventured. This group will rise to larger pro- 
portions as the junior college comes to provide training 
in the semiprofessions. Additional mitigating circum- 
stances are (1) that expenditures for some of this 
work have entered into the estimate made, (2) that in 
such lines as commerce and home economics, if classes 
are kept at good size, the average costs are not likely 
to be much higher if higher at all, (3) that a great deal 
of the work taken by students in some of the special 
curricula represented is of the liberal-arts (or non- 
special) type, and (4) that the lower or junior-college 
levels of work in most of these specialized curricula 
[ 405 ]

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
(engineering for example) are less expensive than are 
the upper or senior-college levels. 
It must be apparent that in order to keep the cost 
per student near a reasonable figure it will not be 
practicable to attempt to provide in all junior-college 
units the first two years of all preprofessional and 
professional curricula beginning with the first college 
year. As with the high schools, it will be found neces- 
sary to restrict the smaller junior colleges to fewer of 
these specialized curricula than can be economically 
maintained in the larger junior colleges. It will be 
possible to defend the introduction into a single larger 
unit of all or nearly all types of curricula to be found 
in the first two years of our present university organi- 
zation. Certainly the introduction of all necessary 
types will be feasible and also essential in any com- 
plete state system of junior colleges. 
The discussion of this subject should not be dropped 
without reference again to the simplification of cur- 
ricular problems that is almost certain to follow the 
general adoption of the junior-college plan which in- 
volves the upward extension of the secondary school. 
The popularization of these school years that will in 
this way be achieved will encourage the setting up of 
preprofessional curricula ending with the sophomore 
college year in some professional lines: such an inno- 
vation has sometimes been desired (for example, in 
engineering), but has not seemed practicable.

The financial problem of establishing junior colleges 
in two states. Having procured an estimated annual 
cost per student enrolled, the logical next steps are 
in the direction of considering the financial respon- 
sibilities involved in establishing junior colleges in 
communities of different sizes in two Mid-Western 
states which have already made notable beginnings 
in the movement; namely, Michigan and Minnesota. 
Throughout this aspect of the study the desirable 
minimum of two hundred students has been assumed. 
The study included cities of a wide range of size, the 
aim being to scrutinize this aspect of the financial prob- 
lem as fully as necessary so that some indication of the 
most suitable size of city might have the opportunity 
to emerge in the process of inquiry. Some cities al- 
ready provided with higher institutions were included, 
although the problem of junior-college establishment 
is not likely soon to arise in them. In Michigan all 
cities with populations of seven thousand and over 
have been included; in Minnesota, because of its 
lesser number of municipalities of good size, those 
included reach down to five thousand. The numbers 
of cities represented were thirty-seven and twenty-six 
respectively. All predictions of numbers of junior- 
college students in the local population likely to 
avail themselves of the opportunities were computed 
from high-school enrollments in these cities, since this 
method of estimate has been found more dependable 
[ 407 ]

than is the proportion of the total populations likely 
to go on to this level of training. 
The types of estimate made of the cost burden of 
maintaining junior colleges in these cities will be illus- 
trated for city A, which is credited by the Census of 
1920 with a population of 7419 and which has the 
lowest local school-tax levy in a group of twelve Michi- 
gan cities with populations ranging between 7000 and 
10,000. This local school-tax rate for 1920 has been 
computed at 4.22 mills. To ask this district to foot 
the entire bill for maintaining a junior college with the 
minimum desirable student-body of two hundred 
would entail an increase of this local rate to 6.17 mills, 
a percentage increase for junior-college purposes of 
46.2, or almost half. If it is assumed that the district 
would pay the full cost for students from the local 
community only and that reimbursement for nonresi- 
dent students would come from other sources such as 
state aid, the levy would be increased to 4.69 mills 
only, or by 11.1 per cent. If in addition to assuming 
the burden for all nonresident students the state would 
distribute aid for local students in the same proportion 
as districts are now being aided in maintaining the 
lower schools, the rate would need to be raised to 4.59 
mills, or by 8.8 per cent. : 
Tendencies are best represented not by this indi- 
vidual case but by the medians for cities of different 
size in the two states. Examination and comparison

of these measures divulge several important findings, 
among them the following: (1) the smaller the city 
the larger the local tax rate for the maintenance of 
lower schools; (2) the smaller the city the larger 
the total and proportional increment for maintaining 
junior-college units with the minimum desirable 
student-body. The median increment in the smaller 
cities of Michigan is almost exactly a half, and for 
those in Minnesota it is well over a fourth. Although 
no absolute criterion of what is practicable in this con- 
nection is at hand, it is too obvious for argument that 
increments of such magnitudes are not to be thought 
of. (3) When it is assumed that the local district will 
bear the cost for resident students only, being fully 
reimbursed for the nonresidents necessary to make up 
the total of two hundred students, the median in- 
crement is much more for the smaller than for the 
larger cities, this larger subtraction being directly 
attributable to the small total number and the rela- 
tively small proportion of junior-college students for 
which the local district would be assuming financial 
responsibility. (4) The chief conclusion to be drawn 
from the data showing the effect of having the state 
bear the same proportion of the burden for local stu- 
dents that it now bears of the cost of maintaining the 
lower schools in the same districts is that only a small 
proportion of the additional burden will be lifted from 
the local community, a proportion so small as to be

relatively inconsiderable. In the three groups into

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
The argument for a more generous policy. Perhaps 
the most telling consideration in support of a much 
more generous policy toward junior colleges than 
seems to be the present policy toward the lower schools 
in these two states arises from a comparison of these 
proportions and amounts with what the state contrib- 
utes to the education of a student taking work on the 
junior-college level in a state university. The latter 
amount would not have been obtainable directly for 
the two states represented without including in the 
investigation a special study of costs on this level in 
the universities of Michigan and Minnesota, and this 
was not practicable. It is possible, however, on the 
basis of certain figures available for the University of 
Minnesota, to make an estimate that may be accepted 
as at least an approximation. The average cost over 
all per student per year in the College of Science, Lit- 
erature, and the Arts has been computed for 1920— 
1921 at $219.15.’ This figure was obtained, of course, 
by including the registration of all students, both in 
the junior college and in the senior college. It must 
therefore be somewhat higher than that for junior- 
college students only. The cost per junior-college 
student could hardly be more than $200 and is prob- 
ably somewhat less. From this should be subtracted

versity of Minnesota, Vol. XXV, No. 7 (April 20, 1922), p. 57. The ma-

the tuition fee of students who are residents of the 
state, amounting in this college to $60 for the three 
quarters of a school year. This leaves an amount not 
far from $130 to $140 per year that is being contrib- 
uted directly or indirectly by the state to the education 
of each student in the first two years of this college. 
As the cost in the freshman and sophomore years in 
other colleges of the university is in all probability 
somewhat higher, the difference not being offset by an 
equivalently higher tuition charge, it is almost certain 
that this estimate of the average contribution of the 
state to the education of the individual student in at- 
tendance upon work in the first two college years at 
the university is a conservative one. In such a situa- 
tion it can hardly be regarded as logical for the state 
to undertake to subsidize any less generously those 
communities which provide junior-college education, 
as it would do if such aid were to be in the same pro- 
portion as for the lower schools that are now subsi- 
dized. It is worth noting that education on higher 
than junior-college levels in state universities, on ac- 
count of its higher cost per student, is being subsidized 
in even larger proportions. Again, it may be judged 
from the conclusions in the treatment of economic 
democratization (see Chapter V) that the subsidy is 
being distributed to those who are on the average 
somewhat better prepared to carry a larger proportion 
of the full burden of cost than students who would 
[ 413 ] 
 
-P-A-G-E-426
    THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
avail themselves of the education if it were brought 
nearer their places of residence through the establish- 
ment of junior colleges. 
A second consideration arises out of the certainty 
that in many of the cities where the provision of 
junior-college work can be justified as far as the num- 
ber of students from local sources is concerned, any 
attempt to foot all or most of the junior-college bill 
locally will endanger the interests of education on the 
lower levels. No plan of establishing junior colleges 
can be defended if it involves a large element of hazard 
to efficiency of levels of school work which may be 
regarded as having prior claims to adequate support. 
A state policy of generous subsidies for junior 
colleges is supported, moreover, by any admission 
that the movement is in accord with the inevitable 
forces of reorganization in secondary and higher edu- 
cation. Chapters VII and VIII have presented some 
of the results of the operation of these forces, and, 
among other things, have disclosed the important 
fact that for most students enrolled the two junior- 
college years may be rightly looked upon as the con- 
cluding years of the period of general or of secondary 
education. Universal practice in this country indi- 
cates that we have committed ourselves to a policy of 
providing the school patron with secondary education 
free of cost. It would therefore be difficult to show 
why, anticipating the evolution of the secondary 
[ 414 ]
-P-A-G-E-427
    LOCATION AND MAINTENANCE 
school to include the junior-college years, any policy 
should be followed which is likely to oblige the com- 
munities maintaining the work to levy a tuition charge 
against those in attendance. Without generous sub- 
vention by the state, it would be difficult to avoid this 
charge, as is evident from any facts that illustrate the 
widely differing resources where junior colleges are 
otherwise feasible and from the imperativeness of 
safeguarding the interests of education on lower levels. 
What one state is doing. In California (a state in 
which the public junior college has made more prog- 
ress than in any other) state support has within the 
last few years arrived at a much more desirable stage 
than that which would characterize a policy of assist- 
ance in proportion to current conditions of state aid 
for lower schools in Michigan or Minnesota. To each 
junior college maintained in districts organized in 
accordance with a law passed in 1921 there is paid an 
allotment of $2000 per annum and an attendance 
grant of $100 per student in average daily attendance, 
one condition being that “no junior-college district 
shall receive any state allotment unless it has provided 
during the preceding school year an amount for main- 
tenance at least equal to the amount apportioned by 
the state.”* Assuming a student-body of one hundred

  THE JUNIOR-COLLEGE MOVEMENT 
from local sources, the allotment is equal to $20 per 
student per year. This, together with the attendance 
grant of $100 per student, is not far from the esti- 
mated amount the state of Minnesota is, without reim- 
bursement, paying for the education of the average 
student in junior-college years of the College of 
Science, Literature, and the Arts at its state university. 
It is, however, in excess of the amount of aid being 
paid to those districts of California which still main- 
tain junior colleges under the law that authorized their 
establishment prior to 1921, and there are several of 
these districts. 
Differentiating aid for residents and for nonresi- 
dents. The data of the first main division of this 
chapter make it evident that in order to recruit the 
minimum desirable unit many communities will need 
to draw considerable proportions of their junior-college 
student-bodies from beyond the borders of the district. 
Materials in the financial portions emphasize the often 
impossible increase in the local tax rate that must be 
imposed for schools if these communities endeavor to 
carry the burden of providing education on this level 
for both resident students and a large number and 
proportion of nonresident students. If we grant the 
desirability of having a state policy of junior-college 
encouragement that opens up opportunities of educa- 
tion on this level in much the same manner in which 
it has been achieved in many states on the conven-

LOCATION AND MAINTENANCE 
tional high-school level, we have the need of taking 
away from the community in which the junior-college 
is maintained all or nearly all the burden of cost for 
nonresidents. The fact that a junior-college estab- 
lishment, on account of its demands in the way of 
population and high-school enrollment, can properly 
be accomplished in a relatively smaller number of com- 
munities than those in which high-school work can and 
should be given, makes the need more imperative. 
The district in which the junior college is main- 
tained must be fully willing to accept all nonresident 
students. 
California has taken steps in this direction, as 
may be seen in the following digest of the statutory 
provision :* 
The act providing for the organization of junior-college 
districts and for the maintenance of junior colleges therein, 
approved May 27, 1921, endeavors to make junior colleges 
accessible to students residing in counties wherein no such 
college is located. The provisions in the present case are 
similar to those relating to high schools. In each county 
wherein there is not a junior college, the county superin- 
tendent is required to certify annually to the Board of 
County Supervisors and to the county auditor the total net 
cost, less state aid, for educating, during the next preced- 
ing year, all junior-college pupils residing in such county

but not in any junior-college district, and the estimated 
amount needed for that purpose for the current year. 
A special tax upon all taxable property within the 
~ county not situated in any junior-college district must be 
levied by the County Board of Supervisors. This tax must 
be sufficient to defray the net cost of educating [less state 
aid], for the current year, students attending a junior col- 
lege in an adjoining county. 
If the Board of Supervisors fails to make a levy, the 
county auditor must make the same. 
What makes these provisions fall short of the full 
needs of the situation is that they do not apply to all 
types of junior-college districts and that they apply 
only to students in counties outside the one in which 
the junior college is maintained. Some may object 
that this net cost is borne by a local political unit— 
the county—rather than by the state; but it must be 
remembered that the state is already contributing 
$100 per student plus the annual allotment of $2000, 
and that it is only the net cost less state aid that is 
being paid by the county. Nevertheless, there will be 
those who would be disposed to prefer state subven- 
tion up to the full amount or almost the full amount 
of the cost for nonresidents. 
Final comments on where to establish junior col- 
leges. Before a state system of junior colleges is in- 
stituted it will be essential to keep constantly in mind, 
besides the factors so far recognized, the important 
[418 ]
-P-A-G-E-431

question of such a geographical distribution of the 
units as will serve best the whole state. They should 
not be placed so near together as to tend to reduce too 
far below the desirable minimum the number of stu- 
dents in any unit. On the other hand, to serve the 
entire state it might be found necessary to encourage 
the introduction of the work in a small proportion of 
districts where the cost per student to the state might 
turn out relatively high because of the small number 
enrolled. The work of establishing them should be 
done very guardedly so as to serve the youth of the 
state as economically as possible. A condition compli- 
cating an adequate solution is to be found in those 
communities in which higher institutions, some public 
and others private, are already in existence. Their 
presence cannot be ignored. In several states this fact 
will remove from the feasible list a number of com- 
munities that would otherwise be desirable localities 
for establishing junior colleges. | 
Doubtless the most significant admonition to be 
made where state encouragement or establishment is 
contemplated is to urge scientific rather than “‘politi- 
cal” location. Experience has often shown that loca- 
tion by log-rolling results too much in mislocation, 
as is demonstrable in certain instances where normal 
schools or other higher institutions have been estab- 
lished without regard to sources of student-body etc. 
Scientific location of junior-college units requires that

among the facts to be assembled and used are the 
numbers of students who shall be served, their distri- 
bution as residents or nonresidents of the locality, 
transportation facilities, the financial situation in each 
district under consideration, the degree of efficiency 
of the lower schools, and the support of the lower 
schools. Unless there is a thoroughgoing study of 
the state in these and allied respects before. a pro- 
gram of junior-college establishment is ventured 
upon, a few years of experience might result in more 
to regret than to commend.

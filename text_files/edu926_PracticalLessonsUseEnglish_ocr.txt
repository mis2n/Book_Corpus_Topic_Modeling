aguage have been planned with reference to the 
of both classes. . 
ention should be given to the language used by 
ll recitations — every lesson, in fact, should be a 
on. But special training must also be given upon 
t this work the aim is to lead the pupil to see 
-to cultivate his powers of observation at every 
irst, the learner’s attention is directed to the use 
f language as the expression of thought. His study is not 
onfined to detached sentences. Selections from some of the

iv PREFACE. 
Each new topic is brought out by means of ora 
This is followed by a written exercise, aiding 1: 
remember the facts learned, and also training th 
of independent work. 
In every lesson, a definite task is laid out for tk 
the child remembers best that which interests him most, car 
_has been taken to bring each exercise as near as possible to th 
child’s own experience, 
The reasons why certain forms are right and others wron 
are, for the most part, omitted. The aim is to lead the pup 
to use habitually the right expression. 
Incorrect forms for correction are not given. It is 
that incorrect forms should not be placed before child: 
child is led to avoid common errors by being trained rom tn 
first to use the correct forms. 
: While nearly every lesson is a lesson in oral or «. 
composition, or in both, special lessons in compositior 
given. In these lessons, the pupil is led to see clea: 
he is required to express his thoughts in writing. 
Special attention is given to letter-writing and to | 
forms. Care has been taken to make this part of tne wor! 
practical. 
_ Thanks are returned to all who have aided, by 
in the preparation of this work, and to the sever: 
-who have kindly permitted selections from their pul 
be used. Particular acknowledgments are offered 
Houghton, Mifflin, & Co. for permission, by spe: 
ment, to use selections from the works of Longfello 
and Lucy Larcom.

SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS. 
Oe 
T is not expected that the exact amount of work laid out 
IL in each lesson will be all that is required for every class. 
Such additional exercises should be given as the needs of the 
class may demand. Much of the work, partjeularly in composi- 
tion, is meant to be suggestive merely. “All school studies 
afford material for good work in composition. Whatever the 
' pupil is interested in, whether it be a topic connected with his 
reading, geography, history, or some other lesson, will afford 
him a good subject for composition. Topics of local or of 
general interest will have a new meaning to the pupil if he 
writes about them. 
Never ask a pupil to express a thought in writing until he 
sees clearly what he is trying to express. If one is trained 
from the first to express only those thoughts which are clearly 
seen, he will acquire greater accuracy of expression. 
In dictation exercises, read each -sentence slowly once, then 
require the class to write. Pupils must be trained not only to 
write correctly, but also to ear correctly. 
Require all written work to be carefully done. Accept 
nothing but the pupil’s best work. 
The sentences in large type are to be used in developing the 
various subjects. The pupil should read these sentences from
-P-A-G-E-7
vi SUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS. 
  
the book, and should answer orally such questions on them 
may be asked. The questions in smaller type are for ~ 
of the teacher, but they should not be followed too 
The teacher should add such questions of her own as 
needed to make the subject clear. After the pupil }: 
led, by means of questions, to see the truth presentea, ni 
should, without assistance, write the exercise which follows. 
The two books of this series are intended to cover the wor 
from the third year of school to the High School:

Little Bell,” said he.

And the Blackbird piped — you never heard 
Half so gay a song from any bird;

All for love of that sweet face below, 
Dimpled o’er with smiles,

And shine forth in happy overflow 
From the brown, bright eyes.

THE BUSY BEE. 
Let us watch the bees as they pass to and fro from their hive. 
First of all we see-some half-dozen around the door. They 
re there to warn off intruders. If we approach too near the 
vont of the hive, one of these sentries will dash forward with 
n angry buzz; and, if we do not wisely take the hint, the brave 
uttle soldier will soon return with help from the guard-room to 
enforce the command. 
There are three substances required in the hive,— pollen, or 
bee-bread, the food of the young bees; wax to make the combs ; 
and honey for the support of the community. The bees that 
‘are passing and repassing the sentries are not all laden alike. 
Some of them have little yellow or red tufts on their legs, others 
have none. But all that return are laden. Those with tufts on
-P-A-G-E-43

their legs have been collecting pollen from flowers. T] 
gatherers and the wax-gatherers carry their stores 
throats. . 
To understand how the pollen is carried, we should 
a bee’s hind leg with a microscope. The upper joit 
tened, and its edges are surrounded with stiff hairs, wi 
a sort of basket. .When the bee enters a flower, i, tuaco 
plunge into the pollen. The pollen is brushed down into th 
little basket, till a good-sized ball is formed. If the bee cannes 
complete its load in one flower, it will always seek ou | 
of the same kind. It will not mix the pollen of twe 
kinds of flowers. 
The honey-gatherers and the wax-gatherers draw in the swey 
juices from flowers by their trunks. The trunk serves 7= 
mouth and a pump. The liquid passes through this into 
throat, and is thus carried to the hive. .

COPERNICUS AND WHAT HE THOUGHT. 
About 400 years ago there was a man named Copernicus. 
He lived in the city of Rome and taught mathematics in one of 
the great universities. 
He watched the motions of the sun and stars, and studied 
them carefully. He could not believe that the sun and moon 
and stars were fastened in a crystal arch that whirled around 
the earth once a day. This was what other people thought, but 
he believed that such beauty as he saw in the skies must~be 
due to some simpler and more beautiful arrangement. 
You remember the little rhyme, 
“Twinkle, twinkle, little star, 
How I wonder what you are,” 
but I must tell you that @// stars do not twinkle. If you look 
at them at night when the sky is clearest, you will see how

  lively the light of most of them sparkles and flashes, as if 
were laughing at you, but if you look carefully, you may fi 
few that do not twinkle at all; they shine with a clear a: 
steady light. These are called planets. The earth is on 
these planets, and if you could get far enough away from it 
would see it shine as brightly as any of them. 
Now Copernicus saw that the sun and all these planets 
in a system by themselves; the twinkling stars are far a 
beyond them all. He believed the earth to be a globe, tur 
around upon its axis once a day. He believed the sun and 
the other planets to be globes too, and that they were whir 
on their own axes also, He watched their motions through 
heavens and found that each one has its own path in whic 
travels around the sun. They leave no track behind them, < 
yet their way is never lost. Time after time has each one t1 
elled over and over again its noiseless journey in its smooth ; 
unmarked pathway around the sun. 
Copernicus hardly dared to tell the world his new ideas ab 
the heavens, for it was then a dangerous thing to believe a 
thing different from what others thought to be true. Hy- - 
did, would sometimes be driven from his home, shut 
prison, or punished with painful torture. So Copernicu: 
his thoughts to himself, but he wrote them out in a little 
and not until the very day on which he died was th. 
printed copy of it received. What he did not dare to

THE SPACIOUS FIRMAMENT ON HIGH. 
L 
The spacious firmament on high, 
With all the blue ethereal sky, 
And spangled heavens, a shining frame, 
Their great Original proclaim. 
The unwearied sun, from day to day 
Does his Creator’s power display ; 
And publishes, to every land, 
The work of an Almighty hand.

Soon as the evening shades prevail, 
The moon takes up the wondrous tale; 
And nightly, to the listening earth, 
Repeats the story of her birth: 
Whilst all the stars that round her burn, 
And all the planets, in their turn, 
Confirm the tidings as they roll, 
And spread the truth from pole to pole.

Rose cheerless over hills of gray,

Of life-blood in the sharpened face,

Beat with low rhythm our inland air.

Unwarmed by any sunset light 
The gray day darkened into night, 
A night made hoary with the swarm

As zigzag wavering to and fro 
Crossed and recrossed the wingéd snow: 
And ere the early bedtime came 
The white drift piled the window-frame, 
And through the glass the clothes-line posts 
Looked in like tall and sheeted ghosts. 
So all night long the storm roared on: 
The morning broke without a sun ; 
In tiny spherule traced with lines 
Of Nature’s geometric signs, 
In starry flake, and pellicle, 
All day the hoary meteor fell ;

When a phrase or a clause is placed out of its natural position, it is 
said to be transposed. 
A transposed phrase or clause should generally be sepa-

When one person repeats the exact words of another, the quotatior 
is called a direct quotation. 
When one person tells what another has said, but does not use the 
speaker’s exact words, the quotation is called an indirect quotation. 
What kind of quotation do you see in the third example? What 
kind in the fourth example? 
By what are the direct quotations enclosed? With what kind of 
letter does each begin? What mark is placed before each direct quo- 
tation? 
The first word of a direct quotation should begin with a 
capital letter. If the quotation is short, it should be sep- 
arated from the preceding part of the sentence by a comma; 
as, The man said, “ I have finished the work.” 
An indirect quotation should not be enclosed by quotation 
marks, should not begin with a capital letter, and generally 
should not be separated from the preceding words by a 
comma ; as, The man said that he had finished the work.

Hamelin Town’s in Brunswick, 
By famous Hanover city ; 
The river Weser, deep and wide, 
Washes its wall on the southern side ; : 
A pleasanter spot you never spied ; 
But, when begins my ditty, 
Almost five hundred years ago, 
To see the townsfolk suffer so 
From vermin, was a pity. 
IL 
Rats ! 
They fought the dogs, and killed the cats, 
And bit the babies in the cradles, 
And ate the cheeses out of the vats, 
And licked the soup from the cooks’ own ladles,

Split open the kegs of salted sprats, 
Made nests inside men’s Sunday hats, 
And even spoiled the women’s chats, 
By drowning their speaking, 
With shrieking and squeaking 
In fifty different sharps and flats. _ 
um. 
At last the people in a body 
To the Town Hall came flocking: 
“Tis clear,” cried they, “ our Mayor’s a noddy ; 
And as for our Corporation, — shocking 
To think we buy gowns lined with ermine 
For dolts that can’t or won’t determine 
What’s best to rid us of our vermin!” 
At this the Mayor and Corporation 
Quaked with a mighty consternation. 
Iv. 
An hour they sat in council ; 
At length the Mayor broke silence: 
“T wish I were a mile hence! 
Oh for a trap, a trap, a trap!” 
Just as he said this, what should hap 
At the chamber door but a gentle tap? 
* Bless us,” cried the Mayor, “ what’s that ? 
Anything like the sound of a rat 
Makes my heart go pit-a-pat !” 
“Come in!” —the Mayor cried, looking bigger ; 
And in did come the strangest figure !

His queer long coat from heel to head _ 
Was half of yellow and half of red; 
’ And he himself was tall and thin, 
With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin, 
And light loose hair, yet swarthy skin, 
No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin, 
But lips where smiles went out and in. 
v. 
He advanced to the council-table: 
And, “ Please your honors,” said he, “I’m able, 
By means of a secret charm, to draw 
All creatures living beneath the sun, 
That creep, or swim, or fly, or run, 
After me so as you never saw! 
And I chiefly use my charm 
On creatures that do people harm, — 
The mole, and toad, and newt, and viper; 
And people call me the Pied Piper. 
Tf I can rid your town of rats 
Will you give me a thousand guilders?” 
“One? fifty thousand !’” — was the exclamation 
Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation. 
VI. 
Into the street the Piper stept, 
And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered, 
You heard as if an army muttered ; 
And the muttering grew to a grumbling ; 
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling ; 
And out of the houses the rats came tumbling.

You should have heard the Hamelin people 
Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple. 
“Go,” cried the Mayor, “and get long poles, 
Poke out the nests and block up the holes! 
‘Consult with carpenters and builders, 
And leave in our town not even a trace 
Of the rats!” when suddenly, up the face 
Of the Piper perked in the market-place, 
With a, “ First, if you please, my thousand guilders!”   
vo. 
A thousand guilders! The Mayor looked blue; 
So did the Corporation too. 
To pay this sum to a wandering fellow 
With a gypsy coat of-red and yellow!

~ “Beside,” quoth the Mayor, with a knowing wink, 
“Our business was done at the river’s brink; 
But as for the guilders, what we spoke 
Of them, as you very well know, was in joke. 
Besides, our losses have made us thrifty. 
A thousand guilders! Come, take fifty!” 
The Piper’s face fell, and he cried, 
“No trifling! I can’t wait, beside! 
And folks who put me in a passion 
May find me pipe to another fashion.” 
“How?” cried the Mayor, “d’ye think I'll brook 
Being worse treated than a cook? 
You threaten us, fellow? Do your worst, 
Blow your pipe there till you burst!” 
Ix. 
Once more he stept into the street ; 
And to his lips again 
Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane ; 
And ere he blew three notes 
Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering, 
Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering, 
And, like fowls in a farmyard when barley is scattering, 
Out came the children running. 
All the little boys and girls, 
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls, . 
And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls, 
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after 
The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.

The Mayor was dumb, and the Council stood 
As if they were changed into blocks of wood, 
Unable to move a step, or cry 
To the children merrily skipping by, — 
And could only follow with the eye 
That joyous crowd at the Piper’s back. 
But how the Mayor was on the rack, 
And the wretched Council’s bosoms beat, 
As the Piper turned from the High Street 
To where the Weser rolled its waters 
Right in the way of their sons and daughters? 
However, he turned from south to west, 
And to Koppelberg Hill his steps addressed, 
And after him the children pressed ; 
Great was the joy in every breast. 
“He never can cross that mighty top! 
He’s forced to let the piping drop, 
And we shall see our children stop!” 
When lo! as they reached the mountain-side, - 
A wondrous portal opened wide, 
As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed ; 
And the Piper advanced and the children followed, 
And when all were in to the very last, 
The door in the mountain-side shut fast.

Somewhat back from the village street 
Stands the old-fashioned country-seat. 
Across its antique portico 
Tail poplar-trees their shadows throw ; 
And from its station in the hall 
An ancient timepiece says to all, --- 
“ Forever — never { 
Never — forever !””

IL 
Half-way up the stairs it stands, 
And points and beckons with its hands 
From its case of massive oak, 
Like a monk, who, under his cloak, 
Crosses himself, and sighs, alas! 
With sorrowful voice to all who pass, — 
“ Forever — never! 
Never — forever !” 
IIL 
By day its voice is low and light; 
But in the silent dead of night, 
Distinct as a passing footstep’s fall, 
It echoes along the vacant hall, 
Along the ceiling, along the floor, 
And seems to say, at each chamber-door, — 
« Forever —never! 
Never — forever!” 
Iv. 
Through days of sorrow and of mirth, 
Through days of death and days of birth, 
Through every swift vicissitude 
Of changeful time, unchanged it has stood, 
And as if, like God, it all things saw, 
It calmly repeats those words of awe, — 
“ Forever — never! 
Never ~~ forever !”

“ Forever — never!

There groups of merry children played, 
There youths and maidens dreaming strayed ; 
O precious hours! O golden prime, 
And affluence of love and time! 
Even as a miser counts his gold,

“Forever — never ! 
Never — forever!”

From that chamber, clothed in white, 
The bride came forth on her wedding night ; 
There, in that silent room below,

LESSON 1 
THE PARTS OF A LETTER. 
A Letter is made up of five parts. (See Form on next page.} 
If a letter fills a page or more, it should begin about an inch 
and a half from the top of the page. But if it occupies only a 
few lines, it should begin lower down, so that the margins above 
and below the letter may be about equal. The first line of ‘the 
heading should begin a little to the left of the middle of the page. 
A margin should be left on the left-hand side of each page. 
The width of this margin should be about one-quarter of an 
inch on note-paper, and about half an inch on large letter-paper. 
_ The address is usually placed at the beginning of a business 
‘letter and at the close of a familiar letter. 
| When the address is placed at the close of a letter, the saluta- 
tion should begin at the marginal line, on the first line below 
the heading, and the body of the letter should begin at the end 
of the salutation, on the first line below.

  LESSON IL 
| / THE HEADING, 
The Heading of a letter shows where the letter was written 
and when it was written. , 
If the letter is written from a city, the heading shouid contain 
the number of the house, the name of the street, the name of 
the city, and the name of the state. 
Nore.— Sometimes the number of the post-office box is used instead of the 
tmmber of the house and the name of the street. 
If the letter is written from a small town, the heading should 
‘ontain not only the name of the town and the name of the 
state, but the name of the county also. 
If the letter is written from a large school, from a hotel, or 
from any well-known institution, the name of the institution 
hay take the place. of the street and number. : 
The heading should begin about an inch and a half from the 
lop of the page, and a little to the left of the middle. If the 
heading is short, it may be written on one line. If it occupies 
two or three lines, the second line should begin a little farther
-P-A-G-E-203

‘dence or place of business of the person written to. 
Note.— If the letter is an important one, the address should contain nm 
the name of the place where the letter is to be sent, but the street and numb | 
county, or such other items as make up the full address, But in ordinary letters the

THE NATURAL SYSTEM OF 
Vertical Writing 
By A. F, HEWLANDS and R. K. ROW. Six Books, Per doz., 75 etm 
Some of the special merits of our system are : — 
Practicability.. It is the outgrowth of nearly five years’ experi- 
ence in vertical writing with thousands of pupils of all school ages. 
The authors of other series have not had this experience. 
Strength. The books are in marked contrast to most of the 
systems recently published, which are efforts to adapt the sloping 
hand to the upright position. 
Harmony. This system has been carefully worked out with a 
central idea as to form and movement. 
Ease. Our round vertical script can be easily written, En- 
gravers often produce graceful forms and combinations, but such as 
‘one cannot reproduce easily with the pen. Every form and combina- 
tion in our system has been thoroughly tested to avoid such difficulties. 
Rapidity. any of the letter-forms at first considered because _ 
they were artistic and graceful, after having been put to the test were 
discarded because they did not permit rapid execution. 
Educative. The copies in the primary numbers are large and 
are illustrated with tasty outline drawings, stimulating interest in the 
writing and correlating reading, number, nature study, and spelling 
with. the special writing lesson. So far as practicable the correlation 
of studies has been carried throughout the series. The size of the 
letter forms is gradually reduced in the first four numbers.’ 
Economy. Such facilities have been secured for their manufac- 
ture, that books of the very best quality will be furnished at the very 
lowest prices. 
Descriptive circular and semple copies sent on request.

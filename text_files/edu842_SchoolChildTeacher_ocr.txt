PREFACE 
In publishing these Suggestions for the use of South African 
student teachers I make grateful acknowledgment of much kind- 
ness and help received from a number of friends and especially 
from some of the officials of the Cape Education Department. 
The publishing of a book of this kind, the purpose of which is to 
offer to young teachers the knowledge gained from study no less 
’ than the experience resulting from classroom practice, inevitably 
places the writer under a debt to earlier publications. Of this 
debt, it is impossible in many instances to make other than general 
acknowledgment. Where this is the case the textbooks and other 
educational publications which I have used in study and teaching 
are named among the books marked with an asterisk in the lists 
recommended for further study and reading. In all cases of 
| direct borrowing footnotes are made in acknowledgment ; and, 
_where the nature of the debt seemed to demand it, permission 
} toincur the debt has been asked and granted. Special thanks are 
| due on this account to the authors and publishers of The School 
: (Home University Library), Professor Findlay’s account of the 
stages of growth in childhood having been somewhat closely 
followed in Chapter i.; of How to Study which helped me greatly 
in formulating my ideas for Chapter ii; of The Dawn of 
Character from which matter has been drawn for Chapter iti.; of 
| Circular 13 (on English Pronunciation) of the Transvaal Education 
Department, and of Clear Speaking and Good Reading from 
| which some of the vocal exercises in Chapter iv. have been taken ; 
: of The School Music Teacher’s Guide for the scheme of breathing 
| exercises used ; of Studies in Teaching of History, of Let Youth 
but Know and certain articles in The State magazine from which 
  quotations have been made in Chapter ix.; of Underwoods for 
permission to quote The House Beautiful; of Longmans’ Prac-

Department (both the Gazette and certain pamphlets) and the 
Transvaal Education Department’s Regulations for Primary Schools 
have been consulted throughout. Where wording or idea has 
been taken from any of these permission has been obtained—in 
the case of the first two from the Controller of His Majesty’s 
Stationery Office; and in the case-general of the last named, 
from the Superintendent General and the Director of Education, 
Responsibility for the selection of extracts, and the manner in 
which they are made use of, rests, of course, with me. 
My suggestions are made to junior student-teachers themselves. 
It is hoped that the provision for their private study of a book 
which endeavours to put before them in broad outline and in 
simple language the ideas and ideals which should govern education 
in public elementary schools, will set their method ins 
to deal with their subject in detail according to thei 
convictions of what is best in school practice. 
The chapters or sections on such “ special ” subject 
drawing, woodwork and needlework are, it will be n 
brief. The manuals in use give detailed instructions regarding 
methods of teaching these subjects ; all that has been attempted , 
therefore, in the following pages, is to give such knowledge of 
principles as should be acquired by students during training.

CHAPTER I 
THE SCHOOL AND ITS WORK 
“ And these I see—these sparkling eyes,, : 
These stores of mystic meaning, these young lives 
Building, equipping like a fleet of ships, itnmortal ships, 
Soon to sail out over the measureless seas 
On the soul’s voyage.” —WaLT WHITMAN, 
Tue word school at the present day has many shades of meaning. 
Of two of them we make use frequently, as in the sentences: “T 
left my books in school,” and ‘‘ School begins to-morrow.” In the 
first of these the word means a building, in which pupils are gathered 
together that they may be taught ; but it is not a building that is 
meant by it in the second. There it stands not for a concrete object, 
but for an abstract idea—that of an institution organised for the 
purpose of education. It is to the school as an institution that I 
wish to call attention just now. What is the aim of the education 
~ that such institutions are meant to furnish ? 
In every form of education two things must be kept i in view— 
the preparation of the child to take his place in the society to which 
he belongs, to “ earn his living” as we say, and the development 
of his intellectual and spiritual being. In both cases a growth of 
natural powers is involved, and it may be said that the aim of 
education is to provide epportunity for physical, mental, and spirit 
tual growth, while taking account of the claims of material: life— 
the need to earn a living. If, as teachers, we are to help this growth, 
we must, it is clear, know something of its conditions in 4 normal 
A 
   
-P-A-G-E-15
2 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
child. Tn our study of these conditions we must try to sce how we 
can suit our teaching to the facts and needs of child-life, and of the 
child-nature in accordance with which it must be lived. 
The life of human beings passes through several stages before 
it comes to full growth or maturity. School life embraces only 
half of them, but it-will not be enough for us to consider these alone. 
We must know both from what we are rising and to what we are 
reaching, and at each stage we must try to discover what business 
Nature has in hand, and strive to second it. Beginning, then, our 
study of childhood in the first stage of life, we find that it opens with 
the period known as infancy. The derivation of this word shows 
that it means, literally, the period before children are able to talk ; 
but in general use we apply it to the time of their greatest depen- 
dence on their parents,1 even though they have mastered speech 
sufficient for their needs. The period ends in the sixth or seventh 
ear? 
» During infancy children grow faster, proportionately, both in 
height and weight, than at any other time of life. Nature, then, 
intends this period to be given to the business of physical growth. 
Growth in size is most rapid during the first twelve months, In 
this year, we may say, a baby does little but feed and grow. He 
cries, laughs, crows, and makes sounds which resemble the sounds 
of speech ; he stretches, kicks, creeps, and perhaps makes efforts 
to walk; but the remarkable thing about him is the rate of his 
growth. This rapid growth continues to. attract notice till the 
third year of life, when it slackens, and restless movement begins 
to appear as the characteristic feature of later infancy. But 
this is also a form of growth. By its means Nature is striving in 
him for a growth in the control of the muscles of the body. This 
control, as our own observations may show us, has a fixed order of 
development. The earliest movements of a child are such as 
require the control of the large muscles only. He moves his head, 
arms, and legs before he attempts to move his fingers or toes. This 
has its lesson for us as teachers. We learn from it that occupations

for them in law. 
2 Earlier in tropical and sub-tropical countries than in tetipcrac vues y 
earlier, therefore, in South Africa than in Europe. Compared with the 
“infancy ” of the lower animals, this is a long period affording time for layin, 
the foundation necessary for the higher level of mental development reache: 
by mankind.
-P-A-G-E-16

demanding the exercise of small muscles are unsuited to the infant 
room. | 
During this later period of infancy growth in size is still rapid, 
though it has been slackening since the first year. Now in all 
periods of rapid growth nourishment—not food alone, but the other 
essentials of physical life: fresh air, cleanliness, warmth, exercise, 
and rest—is the first necessity of being. Without proper nourish- 
ment, the growth both of the body and of the mind which is depen- 
dent on it, will be stunted. While it is not the business of teachers 
to see to the feeding of their pupils, they should know whether the 
conditions of nourishment are in all cases such as make healthy 
physical development possible. Should the appearance of any 
child suggest that something is wrong, tactful inquiry will often 
reveal the cause, and may lead to its removal. The other essentials 
of physical life are more under the teacher’s control, and she + must, 
of course, do all that she can to render them satisfactory. 
One physical peculiarity very noticeable in the years of infancy 
is the proportionately large size of the head. The brain reaches 
its full weight at the age of eight, a fact which shows that its growth 
must be very rapid up to that time. Such rapid growth warns the 
teacher against undue brain work at this period. The food taken 
into the body is needed to build up its increasing weight, and cannot 
at the same time make good the waste caused by heavy exercise. 
Particularly is this so in the case of the brain. Lessons which 
demand severe mental effort are actually harmful at this stage 
of life. 
Nature herself points out what form brain action should take 
in the infant room. The restless activity which is (except when 
children are asleep or under restraint) the marked feature of later 
infancy, is not merely physical. All movement is governed by the 
brain acting through the nerves and muscles. Muscular action, 
therefore, is brain action, and is the right form of it for infants. 
Formal reading, writing, and reckoning must be left till later. The 
making of letter forms, however (by fair-sized sand- or chalk- 
drawings), and the giving of names to them, and the counting of 
concrete objects as they are touched and moved, are suitable forms . 
of exercise, because the main effort of the children is given to 
making the required movements. Other forms of exercise such

Elsewhere, the masculine pronoun follows it, and is of common gender.
-P-A-G-E-17
4 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
as those required in dressing and undressing, and in | 
and passing things (as, for instance, at table) will help ' 
muscular control and apply it to the child’s home duties.. Fo 
cises in form and colour will give familiarity with these and la, 
foundations of good taste in combining them. The additic | 
stories, poems, action-songs, marching and musical drill shoul: _| 
up the programme for infant classes. 
Care must be exercised in the choice of occupations. While th 
brain reaches its full size early in life, it does not come to full de 
velopment till very much later—not till middle age, in fact; anc 
in infancy, as has been said, it is incapable of making the exac 
adjustment of muscles required for fine work and for accuracy ig 
coarser work, All occupations needing close sight and fine toucl 
are therefore unsuitable for infants. Moreover, we should b 
very careful not to make wounding and discouraging accusation: 
of carelessness and clumsiness. Results which may seem to be du 
to these faults are more likely to be due to natural incapacities o 
infancy which must be left to be remedied by time. The fault may 
be in the nature of the work set or in what we expect in th 
way of results. The laying of fine sticks, the threadin; 
beads, the pricking of fine embroidery patterns, th: 
of small letters, besides requiring the action of mt 
under the child’s complete control in the first years of s: 
put a strain on the eyes which they are unable to bear withc 
Building with blocks, drawing with chalk or in sand an: 
sand or moulding clay into large simple forms will, with | 
ments, give all the muscular training necessary. It must be 
remembered, also, that in these early years it is the n 
themselves that matter, not the results. Perseveranc: 
provement, as we understand them, are virtues for a late: 
is useless at this stage to expect children to repeat the s 
again and again and show improvement each time. Aft 
‘wearisome repetitions, for instance, of the effort to draw ii 
a child’s last attempt may quite possibly be less like t 
than his first. Little children improve in a different wii 
one delighted effort, under the spell of interest, to draw 
to-day and an apple to-morrow will have its result in tt | 
of a peach next week. If the exercises are suitable, any | 
sympathetic teacher will succeed in getting her pupils ta 
efforts that in course of time will yield success. " But tim
-P-A-G-E-18
  The School and its Work 5 
effort will be the chief factors in. improvement ; and, until the 
last year of infant school life, movement for the sake of develop~ 
ment should be the teacher’s aim, not occupation for the sake of 
result, 
It must be remembered, also, that not even the most suitable 
occupations and games chosen by teachers can take the place of 
play in which the children indulge of their own free will and on the 
impulse of the moment. Of course some opportunity for this 
occurs out of schoo] ; but there are many children who have no ~ 
companions of their own age at home, and who, therefore, cannot 
play the games most likely to do them good. Others again, though 
this is not common among healthy, well-nourished children, are, 
if left to themselves, too listless to play actively as much as they 
should. No school session, therefore, should pass without intervals 
for free play in the presence of the teacher. The games may be 
sometimes suggested by her, but should only occasionally be inter- 
fered with. She should be there to come to the rescue in case of 
any accident, to check injustice or rough play, to see that the chil- 
dren who most need it are not left out through their own timidity 
or listlessness, or through the small unkindnesses of which children 
are sometimes guilty. Now and then she may take part as a 
welcome playtellow, but her presence should not be too much felt. 
Play is Nature’s way of educating children between the years of 
three and six ; and groups of children of the same age, left to them- 
selves, instinctively choose the form of play best suited to their 
needs at the moment, and go on till they tire—which, again, is 
Nature’s way of telling them that it is time to stop. 
_ It is interesting to note here that the occupations suited to 
infancy are such as would engage the imitative powers of children 
were there no school course to direct them. Some form would 
strike their fancy, and they would try to copy it with such material 
as they could find; they would notice men laying brick on brick 
in building, and would imitate the action with such smaller objects 
as they could lay hands, on; they would watch their mothers 
kneading bread and making puddings and cakes, and would try. 
themselves to make loaves of sand and mud pies. Education in 
these years is not a matter of verbal instruction, but of practice— 
with the one exception of mother-tongue instruction, in which the 
speaking of words is the practice demanded. “See” is the 
word that should be most often on the lips of the infants’
-P-A-G-E-19
6 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
teacher, for it is by imitating her example that her pupils will 
best learn. 
About their seventh or eighth year children are seen to be chang- 
ing in their habits, interests, and desires. They are leaving in- 
fancy behind them ; but, as Nature’s processes of growth and change 
are gradual, not abrupt, they have not yet fully entered on the 
second well-marked stage of life. All times of change create a 
feeling of uneasiness and dissatisfaction in those passing through 
them ; and, between their sixth and eighth years, our little people 
stand more in need of our understanding sympathy than at any 
earlier time. The joys of infancy are ceasing to satisfy them, while 
the pleasures and interests of the following period are not yet 
within their reach. Hitherto action and fancy have filled their 
lives, leaving nothing to be desired. They have passed from activity 
to activity, from fairy story to fairy story, from play to play, en- 
tirely happy if they have had something to do, something to 
imagine, something to be. Now, this is no longer enough. The 
world of work is beginning to press upon their consciousness. They 
are beginning to desire other results than the mere satisfaction of 
an impulse to do or be this or that. And, as the connection be- 
tween action and some practical result becomes clearer in their 
minds, they turn wistfully to the occupations of their elders with 
a further idea than that of simply imitating their action. They 
want also to realise the same results. Instead of making mud pies, 
they want to make cakes that can be eaten. In school we shall 
find them fingering books, pencils, and pens. Their teacher some- 
times—purposely—reads those wonderful stories out of books, and 
father and mother write letters. Older children can read and write, 
They want to do the same. 
Here, if we have been submitting to her guidance so far, Nature 
is before us still, pointing the way. Formal reading and writing 
and practical arithmetic should now begin, and the occupations 
should change their character. Mat-weaving, straw-plaiting, paper- 
folding, cutting, and placing, all having for their object the making 
of small articles useful in the home or the schoolroom, should engage 
the children’s energies. On these they will work most happily and 
with the best results. For results have now to be taken into 
account, and the encouragement of perseverance and improve~ 
ment becomes part of our duty. We should not forget, how- 
ever, that the children’s newly-awakened desire for results is

already urging them, and that it may be more necessary in some 
cases to guard against strain. Stories and poems should also 
change in character, to meet the coming change in the children

higher order, and fairy stories yielding to such as may help to

myths and stories are best suited to this transition period, for what 
is marvellous in them mingles with what is true in a way that fits 
them perfectly to the needs of little folk emerging

The second well-marked stage in growth is childhood, which, in 
this country, may be considered to begin about the age of seven or 
eight—the time at which the brain comes to its full size and weight— 
and to last about four years. In these years physical growth is 
much less rapid than during infancy. It seems, indeed, almost to 
stop for a time—and children of this age, therefore, are able to 
endure more prolonged and harder exercise of both body and

hay loses its restlessness and gains in power. The desire 
for results, which awoke in the period of transition from infancy, 
induces the perseverance which is necessary for successful accom- 
plishment, whether of work or play, The power of endurance, 
resulting from the decreased rate of growth, renders this persever- 
ance possible without undue fatigue ; and children get through a 
surprising amount of vigorous physical or hard mental exertion 
before they show signs of tiring. Compared with either the earlier 
or following stages of life, childhood is a time of stability and power 
within its limits. Infants are exploring, as it were, both themselves 
and the world into which they have been born. Older boys and 
girls, again, feeling themselves on the brink of a new self and a new 
world—the adult world—return to their earlier method of restless 
experiment in seeking knowledge of them. But children between 
these stages seem to be satisfied for a time with the footing they 
have gained over the threshold of life, and to pause there, engrossed 
in the many activities thrown open to them, before pushing on into 
a wider room,

8 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
In school the desire—first seen at the close of infancy—to read 
and write and share in the other lessons of older scholars urges them 
on. They are willing, indeed eager, to work hard at any task, if 
its purpose is clear to them and its result seems worth while. More 
than this, they delight in striving and conquering for the mere sale 
of the effort and the satisfaction, as must be apparent tc

of action... The world of things must not be allowed to eclipse the 
world of ideas ; and just at this stage there is a danger of its doing 
so. The years of childhood are to some extent a rest period men- 
tally ; and if this rest is not to become permanent inaction, the 
stimulus of thought must be brought gently into play. Again, the 
desire for personal accomplishment tends to make the eager strivers 
somewhat self-centred, if not actually selfish ; and to correct what 
might become a serious fault, sympathy’ must be cultivated through 
an. outlook on other lives than their own, We must not take the 
children. outside the realm of their interests, or expect of them 
virtues which do not belong to their age ; but we may, and should, 
widen those interests by opening up new studies that will lead them 
away from a too close concentration on their own doings. Geo- 
graphy. and history, with the nature study, literature, and music 
begun in the infant room, offer us the very means we need for our 
purpose. Tales of little folk in other lands, life stories of some of 
the world’s: great men and women, some knowledge of the best 
literature suited to their age, together with the influence of good 
music, will have the desired effect of stirring imagination and 
awakening sympathy, and so of helping towards a full development 
of childhood. . 
So much for the school subjects. But, when all is said, these 
do not, at this age, have their full effect unless brought into relation 
with home activities and necds. The division between home inter- 
ests and school interests, always to be deplored, is most harmful at 
this period when the nature of children is turned full-face towards 
useful activity. Their keenness for games is no greater than their 
eagerness to be helpful at home and in school, and we should be poor 
educators if we failed to make use of so. marked a trait. It is not 
necessary to remove the school desk—as some reformers would have 
-us do—in favour of the carpenter’s bench. Reading and writing 
and the power of working out a certain amount of “ paper” arith- 
metic, even when not preparatory for adult occupations, are in- 
creasingly necessary accomplishments, for the mastering of which 
no other time of life is so suitable ; and the part to be played by 
geography, history, literature, nature study, and music lessons is 
important: in the-development of well-balanced interests. It is, 
moreover, possible to make all these subjects serve as links between 
school and home, and in this way to give them a new value. There 
can be no doubt, however, that the time-tables of junior classes
-P-A-G-E-23
10 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
should give a larger proportion of half-hours to manual occupations 
—cardboard-modelling and light woodwork for boys, needlework, 
simple cookery, and laundry-work for girls, and gardening for both: 
The present-day desire to have workshop and housewifery depart- 
ments attached to our schools is quite in accordance with the 
revelations of child study. It is not, however, in carrying out 
ambitious syllabuses that these have their greatest value, but in 
closely relating such school-work to home occupations and to the 
supplying of home needs, 
Again, in gardening—one of the best forms of practical nature 
study—school and home life should be brought into close connec- 
tion. Not only should the children grow in their school plots 
vegetables and flowers for home use, but they should be helped to 
master the principles underlying the preparation and working of 
gardens in order that they may know how to make productive any 
pieces of land attached to their homes. 
As at the close of infancy, so at the close of childhood—which, 
as a rule, occurs a year later in boys than in girls—we encounter an 
unsettled period which marks the onset of a new stage of life. In 
this transition period, as in the earlier one, there is a dissatisfaction 
with pursuits and methods hitherto found satisfying. As far as 
school work is concerned this shows itself in distaste for the drill 
mode of mastering subjects. Repeated mechanical effort becomes 
wearisome. Our pupils wish to apply their minds to their work in 
anew way. They are beginning to be capable of discerning the 
meaning and value of the subjects which have been occupying their 
time. The effect of mere memory work, as they pass beyond child- 
hood, is to deaden interest and degrade knowledge, that should be 
pursued gladly for its own sake, to the level of mere examination 
subjects studied only for the sake of passing some test. In their 
play at this time children begin to care less for personal achieve- 
ment, and to choose games which require them to.combine for the 
success of the “ side ” to which they belong. In this change we see 
the awakening of the social instincts which, rightly cult” = ~~~

The widening of this difference in outlook marks their entry. 
upon the third decisive stage of growth—girlhood or boyhood, In 
more ways than one the stage shows resemblances to that of infancy, 
It is, for instance, a period of rapid growth both in height and 
weight, and, like the earlier period of rapid-growth, is a time of 
susceptibility to sickness—a fact which should be taken into account 
by us, and made to act as a check on our demands if these en- 
croach on the amount of rest and recreation necessary for healthy 
youth. It is also a time of experiment, though this is concerned 
with different powers. In the years of infancy our pupils were 
interested chiefly in their muscular powers. They were fond of 
watching the actions of their elders and of trying to copy them. 
They were interested in the world of things and in exploring it— 
primarily by means of their senses of sight and touch, and, ina 
lesser degree, by means of their hearing, taste, and smell. In early 
youth these characteristics repeat themselves, but with a difference: 
Mere muscular movement has ceased to interest ;, and mind move- 
ment, with its result in conduct or behaviour, becomes the subject 
of their new experiments.’ ‘Their interest in adults makes them 
desire to be treated as their elders are treated, and leads to the 
practising of grown-up ways. The sense of change within them 
calls for a new method of discipline. The direct commands 
suitable in the case of children should be given up as far as 
possible for the method of suggestion, our government at this 
period yielding gradually to self-discipline. At the same time, sub- 
mission to customary rules of good behaviour should be enforced. 
This is important, for at this time the individuality of our pupils 
begins to urge them towards opinions and actions which in the 
absence of wise and firm guidance may lead them astray. It is 
impossible to lay down hard-and-fast rules for the government of 
girls and boys, for the fact that in this stage of their growth they 
begin to differ widely both in character and in capability makes 
individual treatment necessary. What is needed in our attitude 
of the teacher is a quiet insistence on ordifiary good conduct and 
manners, together with a generous forbearance in matters not 
likely to bring evil consequences either on the pupils themselves 
or on others. We must, moreover, be prepared for some vari- 
ableness and inconsistency in the opinions, feelings, and actions 
of our pupils. In healthy, wisely-guided youth these are only as 
the oscillations of a compass-needle before it sets true to its pole.
-P-A-G-E-25
12 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
The matter of government and discipline is made easier by the fact 
that there is at this time a marked development of the feelings 
and emotions which influence conduct. “Fear, anger, love, pity, 
jealousy, emulation, ambition, and sympathy,” we are told,’ “ are 
now born or are springing into most intense life.” With these aids 
at call, we should not find our task of direction—difficult and deli- 
cate as it admittedly is—in any sense hopeless. 
As far as the actual work of the school syllabus is concerned, we 
need have no fear of any lack. of interest at this period if our teach- 
ing deals suitably with suitable matter. As has been said, a restless 
and inquiring interest in conduct marks this stage of growth, while 
the meaning and value of studies to which hitherto they have per- 
haps applied themselves mechanically now begin to grow clear to 
our pupils. As, at an éarlier stage, the nature of children is inclined 
towards useful activity, so the mind of youth is turned towards all 
that concerns adult behaviour—the thought, endeavour, achieve- 
ment, and aspiration of grown men and women. As “all that men 
have devised, discovered, done, felt, or imagined lies recorded in 
books,” an introduction to some of the best of these should enter 
largely into the education of pupils in this stage of growth. Books 
of travel and biography, historical novels and records of history 
from original sources, works dealing with the wonders of science and 
art, the finest prose and poetical literature of their own and—by 
translations when otherwise impossible—of other nations, will 
admit them to an adult world, a knowledge of which will do much to 
stimulate in a healthy way their developing intellect and emotions. 
But, just as in childhood there is a danger that the world of 
material things may eclipse the world of thought and ideas, so, in 
this later period, the opposite tendency is to be feared ; and it will 
be part of our task to see that our pupils do not lose themselves in | 
bookland. The duty of living their lives in deeds as well as in 
dreams must be impressed upon them by suitable activities in 
school and at home, and by the provision as far as is possible of | 
| 
  such social intercourse as a variety of school societies may be made 
to afford. Above all, they must feel the personal interest and 
affection of warm-hearted and broad-minded teachers whose 
earnest desire it is to help them to realise the ideals of life and con- 
duct which they form in these opening years. Once again, they are

passing through: the discomfort of a transition ‘period.. Behind 
them lie the pleasures of childhood ; before them, ‘the fuller and 
deeper joys of adult life not yet attained ; again, as in their first 
period of change, they have need of all the help which an under- 
standing sympathy can give. No period of their growth is mote 
critical than this ; and if their elders fail them in it by not recog- 
nising its infinite possibilities, or by not yielding them opportunity 
for the healthy exercise of their awakening emotions, their whole 
future life will be stunted by their being unable to grow to the 
stature of the full manhood or womanhood Nature meant them to 
reach. It is of equal importance that certain of these emotions 
shall not be stimulated and prematurely experienced, for too early 
development of them will in the long run be found more stunting 
even than the suppression against which warning has been uttered. 
Prevention lies largely in the hands of parents and teachers, who, 
by a wise supervision , and the provision of interests and pleasures 
suited to this time, may keep their young charges from reaching 
forward to those of a later age. 
With the latest stage of growth—adolescence—which begins 
(allowing for variation in the case of individuals) about the fifteenth 
or sixteenth year, and with maturity, which marks the end of growth, 
young teachers are not directly concerned, as their pupils pass out 
of their hands ‘before these stages are reached, We may now, 
therefore, proceed to apply to the subjects of instruction, and to 
the teacher who uses them to promote the education of his pupils, 
what has been said of the school and the child, endeavouring to see 
how he may best. use the one for the good of the other. 
The desire to impress one all-important idea animates these 
pages—that schools are institutions in which lives, and not lessons 
merely, aré to be dealt with. Hence the subjects of school ’instruc- 
tion are chiefly important in proportion as: they affect, through 
mind ‘and character, the lives of the pupils. In choosing them, 
therefore, and deciding the amount of time to be given to each, 
we have to ask what Education is meant to do for the child. To 
this question Froebel answers in The Education of Man, that. it 
“should lead and guide man to clearness concerning himself, to 
peace with Nature and to unity with God ; hence it should lift him 
to a. knowledge of himself and of mankind, to a knowledge of God 
and of Nature, and to the pure and holy life to which such know- 
ledge leads ” ; that is, “it must train him to-understand the world
-P-A-G-E-27
14 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
he lives in, and to act rightly in it with regard to his Creator, his 
neighbour and himself.” 
The answer suggests a consideration of knowledge under three 
cheads—spiritual, natural, and humanistic. With the spiritual side 
the Church has a special concern. If we leave that aside for the 
moment, we see that all other subjects fall under the head of either 
Nature Study or Human Study. Under the former, we should group 
not only what goes by that name in schools, but also geography and 
the various sciences ; all, in fact, in which any aspect of the universe 
forms the subject-matter. Under the latter would come all which 
are concerned with the story of man’s life, activities, and aspirations. 
As, however, it is largely in their relation to man that nature studies 
have value for us, and as man’s life and activities have been always 
and everywhere controlled by Nature’s laws, we shall not expect to 
find the two groups rigidly separated from each other. There will 
naturally be numerous inter-relations. Thus, although we put arith- 
metic, geography, and the natural sciences in the “nature” group, 
it is clear that arithmetic deals with man’s mode of reckoning and 
counting, that geography treats of the earth as the home of man, 
while scientific research is carried on by men and primarily for the 
‘benefit of mankind. In the “ human” group we find that history 
gives the story of mankind as lived on the earth, his home, of which 
geography treats ; that literature is closely linked with nature studies 
through the writings of naturalists and explorers, and that language 
itself is the means by which the discoveries of natural. science have 
been made known. In teaching we need to make use of all these 
threads of association as well as of those connecting the separate 
subjects within the two main study groups, 
We must now endeavour, from this new point of view, to relate 
the various branches of knowledge more systematically to what we 
know of child nature ; for only as they are seen to influence the life 
of thechild beneficially—through his interests, activities,andneeds— 
can they claim a place in the school curriculum. When we have 
made our inquiry it will be necessary “to balance the curriculum 
so nicely that no ordinary aspect of the world is wholly omitted and 
no ordinary human activity entirely starved,” + for, though “ the 
school cannot set before itself as the aim of its instruction an attempt 
to cover all departments of human activity,” “ it must consider the 
1 Dodd, The Child and the Curriculum, p. 46.
-P-A-G-E-28
ae The School and its Work 15 
broad nature of them all in order that no typical aspect of human 
experience or form of human activity may be omitted.” 1 
The claim of language to be included in the school course will be 
readily acknowledged. As a social being the child feels a need for 
language in his earliest years. As he gets to know more people, to 
gain new experiences and to feel new interests in passing from the 
home to the school, his need to understand and speak his mother- 
tongue increases. Language, therefore, as the expression of desire 
and determination and thought takes the first place among the sub- 
jects of instruction. 
While, however, the child’s social life begins in the home and 
develops in the school, it does not end in either. His life will be 
lived in a world of men whose traditions of government and con- 
duct are rooted in a distant past, whose inventions, discoveries, 
actions, feelings, and thoughts “ lie recorded in books.” It is neces- 
sary, therefore, that he should be prepared for his wider interests 
and activities by extending inquiry, thought, and feeling to matters 
outside the range of his own personal observations and experiences. 
Literature and history—Bible literature and history where religious 
thought and feeling are concerned—are the subjects best fitted for 
this purpose, and are consequently included in the humanistic group 
of studies. 
Along with this increase of interest in words, and in the world 
of thought, feeling, and action of which they tell, the child develops 
an interest in the world of concrete objects which surround him 
on every side—the furnishings of home and farm, of school and 
street, the features of the country-side and the phenomena of nature. 
In direct relation to this interest are nature study, the observa-~ 
tional side of geography and lessons on familiar things, the aim of 
which will be to make him at home in the world of nature, as the 
earlier-named subjects should do in the world of men. These, 
therefore, must also be given a place. Number, in its relation to 
things, demands consideration ; and arithmetic, beginning with 
concrete counting and leading up to abstract calculation, must be 
admitted as a necessary member of the same group. 
The interest in making and doing things, so noticeable in chil- 
dren, together with the need for training hand and eye, claims room 
for modelling and weaving, cardboard-, wood- and metal-work,

his own people ; arithmetic, when he has need to number,’ 
or to-measure. The object is always to present ideas ani 
activities at the moment when the pupil’s mind and ser. 
are ready for them. This moment will occur when some 
1 Professor Dewey, quoted in Zhe Child and the Curriculum; Dodd, p. 5
-P-A-G-E-30
  The School and its Work 17 
experience—something in his school or home life—has set him 
thinking about or trying them, for “ the life from which all fruitful 
school instruction must start is always the actual life of the pupil.” ? 
Thus the relating of sign, sound, and idea in reading will provide 
exercise for the vocal organs and the senses of sight and hearing a8 
soon as the earlier speech work has served its purpose in the infant 
room ; and the exercise will be most fruitful when the underlying 
ideas are such as the children can understand and feel interest in ; 
the making and combining of letter forms in writing will at the same 
time provide a new means of expression and a new occupation. In 
arithmetic, rational methods will teach the truths.of number through 
concrete objects provided by nature studies and familiar experience. 
Nature study itself must in the early stages have to do with the 
outdoor things the child sees and likes and wants to know about, 
and with the things he does ; with his love of plants and animals, 
his fondness for keeping pets and tending a garden. Observational 
geography begins to make him mentally at home in the place he 
lives in ; and the descriptive side of the same subject, through his 
imagination, enables him to picture the surroundings and the lives 
of the children of other countries. Through such activities as 
modelling, brushwork, and drawing, simple handicrafts, singing 
and the rhythmical movements of musical drill, he is trained in new 
ways of showing his own thoughts and feelings. Accompanying 
this practical and expressive work are the beginnings of literature 
and history—in folklore and fairy tales and “ fireside stories of 
battles and brave deeds ”—developing him further on the side of 
his imagination and emotions. 
‘These subjects in this form—constantly concrete and practical— 
should fill the school programme of the two lower standards. In 
Standard II the work of arranging and classifying knowledge 
‘should begin—in language, by a study of the work of words ex- 
amined in the actual speech of the children themselves ; in writ- 
ing, by the putting together of sentences in brief continuous 
narrative ; in arithmetic, by more general introduction of abstract 
number; in geography, by. the mapping of large areas not pre- 
viously seen or measured ; in history, by the cultivation of a time 
sense through the making of simple time-lines. The movement 
towards more abstract work in all subjects is continued from this 
point on until, in the highest class, studies which in each case began 
2 Welton, Principles and Practice of Teaching, p. 34- 
B

18 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
with what the children themselves had discovered or experienced 
or otherwise become aware of, can, because of this early treatment, 
be. understood in their wider and more general form. 
The late position of abstract studies is absolutely necessary 
because of the way in which the mind develops. In the early 
stages of growth “ the child has not yet acquired much knowledge 
of human nature or of the world of things and forces around him.” 
“ He has a tolerably quick grasp of isolated things and events, 
but has small power of synthesis. He cannot combine in his little 
mind things and events so as to perceive the principles and laws 
underlying the things and events which are brought under his 
notice. He consequently is not able to get much insight into the 
trend of human affairs, or to draw logical conclusions from convic- 
tions or ideas. It is a necessary characteristic of primary instruc- 
tion that it must take the world of human learning in fragments ; 
but it is the constant effort of good teaching to correct this defect, 
for there is a great difference between the teacher who requires only 
isolated details of his pupils and the one who directs their atten- 
tion to their relations and interdependences from the beginning.”? 1 
We must begin then “at the child’s end” in all subjects of 
school instruction and fit our steps to his in every stage of growth, 
waiting for him to live out each in turn—physically, mentally, and 
morally—before we try to lead him forward into ways of acting, 
thinking, and feeling that belong to a later stage. In all our be- 
-ginnings we must take full advantage of his personal knowledge, 
gained at home, or in school, of the matter of instruction, discarding 
gradually its illustrative aid as we find him able to disp'--—“** * 
Only so shall we be able to develop in him adult powers « 
and to bring him to an understanding of those wide

conditions are satisfactory, this will be accomplished to‘some extent 
before school years begin. The child will have made, as we say, 
a good start, and our work as teachers will be so much the easier. 
Tt will only be necessary for us, then, to see that, in training his 
mind and character, we do not check the growth of his body by 
interfering with the conditions of health and vigour! Unhappily; 
however, in many cases the homes of children attending public 
elementary schools are very far from providing the conditions 
necessary for bodily well-being ; and there are children who come 
to school heavily handicapped in the race of life. They are pale 
and languid and grimy from overcrowding and underfeeding—or 
wrong feeding—in unclean, ill-ventilated rooms ;, from dirt and 
all the discomfort it brings in its train; from being too hot in 
summer and too cold in winter; from want of rest and from the 
want of exercise to which the other harmful conditions of their 
lives incline them. Children in this state cannot learn. The mind 
cannot be reached by, much less concentrated on, lessons when the 
body is tortured by such disease. Whoever or whatever is to 
blame, such conditions must be altered before school work can hope 
to be-successful ; and how much and how quickly they will be 
altered will depend toa very large extent on our own interest 
goodwill, tact, and determination. 
The task, perhaps, seems hopeless ; but a beginning can be 
made in the school, which is our own domain. The first step in 
the removal of such conditions is to create a discontent with them ; 
and the best way of doing this is ta bring them into sharp contrast 
with others more comfortable and attractive. The school, then, 
should, to begin with, be made to offer those conditions of health 
and comfort.in which the homes are lacking. Of course, responsi- 
bility for the building itself rests with the school committee ; but 
if it is utterly unsuited to its purpose—if it is impossible to keep it 
cool enough in summer, or to make it warm enough in winter, or 
so to arrange it that the children can work in a good light—repre- 
sentations made in the proper quarter will result in its being altered 
sooner or later, and, if we really care, very much sooner. 
_ Apart from all considerations of the suitability of the building 
1 How these are best maintained among school children will be discussed 
later: Here it must suffice to enumerate them—fresh air, sufficient and 
proper food, cleanliness, a right degree of warmth, exercise, rest and re- 
creation.
-P-A-G-E-33
20 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
is the question of its cleanliness. We must insist that the rooms 
in which we and our pupils work are made and kept clean. 
They must be swept every afternoon ; and later, when the dust 
has had time to settle, must be well dusted with a slightly damp 
cloth. Once a week at least the floor, if flagged or boarded, must 
be scrubbed, some disinfectant powder or fluid being added to the 
water, Mud floors, where these exist, must be thoroughly sprinkled 
with water similarly treated. If the school cleaners or caretakers 
are responsible persons, nothing more will be required on the part 
of the head teacher than to explain their duties on engaging 
them ; but where the cleaning is in the hands of a raw native girl 
or boy there must be supervision or the standard of cleanliness 
will be likely to fall. When the school building has been made 
clean, we must see that it is kept clean ; and our supervision must 
extend to the yard and all the premises. Nothing, perhaps, gives 
a worse impression than a school approached through a litter of 
torn papers, wrappings, and scraps of lunch. A covered receptacle 
—the cover being a very necessary attachment in a country where 
high winds are common—should be provided in some convenient 
corner; and the children be made individually responsible for 
seeing that all refuse is placed carefully in this, and not dropped 
about the playground. Equal care should be given to seeing that 
walls, fences, and posts are not disfigured by any kind of drawing 
or scribbling. 
When the cleanliness of the building and grounds has been 
arranged for, the lighting and airing of the rooms should be con- 
sidered. In this country the north light is very strong, and the 
windows should if possible be in other walls, some form of screen 
or shade (such as a verandah roof) being provided for any north 
windows that exist. Blinds are a very necessary part of school 
furnishing in South Africa, and their importance makes them well 
worth the care needed to keep them in good order. Tattered and 
flapping blinds, which admit strong shafts of sunligh’ 7 
desks of teachers or pupils, are a source of discomfort ar 
which, being remediable, should not be endured. By ¢ 
tion to the opening and closing of doors and windo 
lowering and raising of blinds, a good deal can be d 
sub-tropical countries towards securing the best air a

-P-A-G-E-34
’ The School and its Work a ai 
The appointment of a monitor to regulate air and light throughout 
the school sessions, as common sense dictates, will add very materi- 
ally to the comfort of teacher and class. In hot weather the 
temperature can be lowered by sprinkling the floor with water from 
time to time; and if a disinfectant fluid is added to it a double 
purpose is served. 
A schoolroom which receives proper care in these matters, 
which is brightened by good pictures, and in which flowers are 
tastefully arranged day by day and—for faded flowers are worse 
than none—removed when they begin to wither, will soon impress 
itself on the minds of children as a much more attractive place 
than a home in which the laws of health and comfort are neglected. 
Something is gained when the children have made this comparison 
—however unconsciously—for themselves. Their: standard of 
cleanliness and comfort is raised by the mere realising of the differ- 
ence; and if the teacher wisely draws them into her scheme of 
cleanliness and order by giving to each child an individual share 
in maintaining it, they will hold the faster to the higher standard 
and be the more successful in their efforts to extend it from school 
to home. 
But while trying to raise the children’s standard of physical 
comfort, it is necessary to be on guard against creating any feeling 
of rivalry between school and home in their minds, or encouraging 
any criticism of their parents. All that is done for children in 
school must be done not in condemnation of, but, as far as possible, 
in friendly co-operation with their natural guardians. The children, 
moreover, should be led to feel that on certain specified afternoons 
their mothers will be made welcome visitors at the school, to listen 
to their stories, poems, and songs, and to look at their week’s written 
work; By all means in our power we should, as teachers, seek to 
bridge the gulf that at present unhappily exists between school 
and home}; for only when this is done can school work have its 
best and most practical effect on the lives of the children. 
But cleanliness of surroundings and external comfort are: not 
the only conditions necessary for physical well-being. Until State 
maintenance and control of schools, and societies for the protec- 
tion of child-life, have gone further than they have at the present 
day, there will, it is to be feared, be many children who come 
hungry to school, or so unclean in person and clothes that there is 
little chance of reaching their minds through their misused bodies.
-P-A-G-E-35

In such cases it is well to remember that if we cannot do what we 
would, we must do what we can; and it is sometimes possible, as 
has been suggested before, to improve home conditions by tactful 
inquiry about them. Where no improvement follows upon repre- 
sentations courteously and kindly made, it must be from one of 
two reasons : either the parents or guardians through indifference 
and slothfulness will not make the needful changes, or, through 
poverty, ignorance, or illness, they cannot. In such cases we 
shall feel the need of advice. The best quarters in which to seek it 
will be the church to which the parents belong, some charitable 
organisation, or some private person charitably disposed. For 
the school’s sake, almost as much as for the child’s, the efforts must 
continue till some change for the better results. 
It should hardly be necessary to say, that all that is done in 
such cases should be done in the quietest manner, without any 
unnecessary talking about it, and with every possible endeavour to 
avoid burting the feelings of those concerned. Unless parents 
are quite lost to a sense of their responsibilities, there is always a 
certain amount of shame felt by them in accepting help of that 
sort, and matters should be conducted with all tactful consideration 
for this feeling. 
If a child is habitually hungry or dirty, any ordinarily observant 
eye will notice the fact ; but there are other physical ills, from which 
school children sometimes suffer, which can only be discovered 
by a certain amount of special knowledge. It is necessary that 
we should have at least as much knowledge of physiology as will 
enable us to know when a child is suffering from any common 
physical ailment—as, for instance, eye-strain, deafness, obstructed 
nasal passages or any nervous complaint—which is warring against 
his bodily health and mental progress ; and, further, to know what 
measures must be taken to cure the complaint or lessen the suffering. 
All that young teachers in training need to know can be easily 
learnt. There are many books published on the subject. A 
good one is Drs. Shelley and Shenstone’s Health Reader, in three 
parts. Book I gives the most important facts in language suit- 
able for children from eight to ten years old; Book II adds de-~ 
tails to make the course suitable for older children; and Book IIT 
is more advanced still. If all student teachers were to master 
the facts contained in these three little books during their years of 
training—one book in each year—it would mean a very considerable

benefit to the children who are subsequently taught by them. The 
books are cheap, and, from the importance of their bearing on the 
work of teachers, they are specially fitted to be the first volumes 
in that professional library which it should be the ambition of all 
teachers to collect. 
Our consideration of what is required of teachers, in schools 
that are to have the right influence on the lives of children, has taken 
us beyond the years of training, but it is necessary that these 
considerations should be before us: from the very outset of our 
career. The time of training must not be looked upon as mainly 
a matter of class subjects and notes of lessons, but as a preparation 
for influencing the lives and training the characters of young chil- 
dren, As, however, general culture and skill in teaching are the 
chief means of wielding this influence and effecting this training, 
there follow some suggestions to help the student in his twofold 
capacity as learner and teacher.

CHAPTER IT 
THE STUDENT AS LEARNER 
“In whatsoever it is our duty to act, those matters also it is our duty to 
study.” —ARNOLD OF RUGBY. 
ae problem of how best to study is one to which all young teachers 
address them: y need to kriow is 
meant by the word study, what forms of mind-exercise, that is to 
say, are involved in the act, and how full benefit may be derived 
from it, 
. This chapter will treat mainly of book-study ; but it must not 
be thought tat a teacher needs to learn only trom books. Book- 
and a very important part ; but he will be a poor teacher who does 
not add to it the more direct study of language, of school-room 
practice, of nature and of human nature, particularly that of 
children. 
_ General experience goes to prove that, to average students, 
studying is a process of learnin; in which n mechanical rm     
  tried their best to learn by heart the matter set for study, most 
students close their books with a relieved sense of duty done, 
There must be.a reason why one factor of study is allowed to usurp 
the place and parts of all the others. 
The reason, one feels, is not so much that the mechanical 
memorising of words is easier than the other forms of study which 
should, to a large extent, take its place ; for there are many student- 
teachers who do not want merely to get through their work as easily 
as possible ; or that it has been found, in the past, to suffice for 
the passing of examinations ; for there are many, again, who look 
beyond the examination room to the real work awaiting them, and 
25
-P-A-G-E-39
  26 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
are eager to prepare for it. It is, rather; that no other way of 
studying has been insisted on, and, therefore, no other way has 
been tried. The great majority of young students qualifying as 
teachers simply do not know any better way to-study. They 
have _had_given for study books written in language 
So different, in many instances, from their_ordinary speech 
as to be almost_a foreign language to them, They have not 
been able to understand these books easily, and ha¥e_ therefore 
t upon the plan of memorising 1) indi at it 
has enabled them to “pass their examinations ”’—which, too 
often, is all that_has been demanded of them-—they have be- 
__come confirmed in_the method_and have remained ignorant of 
Two grave errors are here seen—the first, that the passing of 
their examinations has been allowed to assume more-importanice 
in the eyes ofstudent-teachers than the preparation for their calling 3 ~flie Second, that passing. has-been possible by mease-of ansivers in 
words mec memorised.and quoted, as is only too apparent, 
without a ir meaning.—The fact, however, that thost 
concerned are alive to these errors, gives hope for the future. It 
is definitely stated in a recent syllabus of the work of student- 
teachers that “ questions set in the examination at the end of the year 
will not be of such a nature that they can be answered as a result of 
mere memorising.” 
Since it is clear that the excess of mere mechanical memorising 
in the work of students is having an injurious effect on their in- 
telligence, it is urgently necessary that the amount of it be reduced. 
It has no power to educate, for it is practised without reference 
to any underlying ideas; it is a mere impressing of words on the 
memory by repeated impact ; it starves the mind and nauseates 
the student, thereby defeating two chief ends of study, which should 
nourish the mind with ideas and stimulate the student’s appetite 
for them. Even from the examination point of view, as shown 
above, it will not serve any longer. What is needed now, therefore, 
is that some more intelligent form of study be made known to 
young students. 
‘The first step towards more intelligent work is made by putting 
before us the proper motives for-study._ For-alt teachers @ great 
animating purpose is pointed out by the words of the famous 
Rugby schoolmaster which stand at the head of this chapter: ‘* Ive

whatsoever it is our duty to act, those matters also it is our duty ta 
study.” We have chosen to be teachers; we have assumed a 
grave responsibility with regard to the lives of children. For us, 
hen, every subje ‘rin which it is 
uty to act. .But in teaching, as another great schoolmaster— 
Thring of Uppingham—constantly impressed by his work and 
writings, “‘ Lives, not lessons” are to be dealt with. Lives first, 
that is, and lessons only as they may be made of service to our 
pupils in helping them to live. have, therefore, an enduring 
motive for the study of each : subject 6, in our 
a to — how to make it of material use or | use or spiritual benefit to 
th the ie second place, the amount of verbal memorising during 
study must be, as emphasized ‘above, considerably lessened. This 
will happen when students make an effort to understand and enjoy 
their study before they set to work to memorise the words of it. 
The change will necessitate a wider and more exact knowledge of 
the meaning of such words as are of common use in students’ text- 
books than is a general possession of their readers. Before anything 
else, therefore, it is necessary that, as students, we learn to make 
companions of our. dictionaries. it must be.a habit with us to 
look up the meaning of every unfamiliar word in each sentence 
that we read. Moreover, we must not be content simply to find 
another word or phrase to substitute for the one in the fext. We 
must see the meaning clear before we are content to pass on ; pur- 
suing it, if necessary, from page to page of the dictionary until it 
yields us words the sense of which is as unmistakeable as that of 
the everyday talk in which we take part. We must be prepared, too, 
to do more than merely run our eye down the dictionary’ 's columns 
of words and meanings. Ruskin tells us that in studying books we 
tmaust regard ourselves as on a quest for gold, the metal we are in 
search of being the author’s mind or meaning, and his words the rock 
which we have to crush and smelt in order to get at it. Our pick- 
axes are our own care, wit, and learning ; our smelting furnace is 
our own thoughtful soul. ‘“ Do not hope,” he says, “ to get at any 
good author’s meaning without those tools and that fire; often 
you will need sharpest, finest chiselling and patientest fusing, before 
you can gather one grain of the metal.” Therefore, first of all, he 
says further, we must get into the habit of looking intensely at 
words and assuring ourselves of their meaning, syllable by syllable—
-P-A-G-E-41
28 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
that is to say, we must not be content with finding meanings, we 
must look for derivations: We may say, as a general rule, that we 
know a word fairly well, when we can see for ourselves how some 
root meaning, at first sight remote, has entered into it. We should 
not, in study, be content with any knowledge less than that. To 
quote Ruskin again : 
“Nearly every word in your language [he was writing of English} 
has been first a word of some other language—of Latin or Greek— 
not to speak of Eastern and primitive dialects. And many words 
have been all these—that is to say, have been Greek first, Latin 
next, French or German next, and English last: undergoing a 
certain change of sense and use on the lips of each nation; but 
retaining a deep, vital meaning which all good scholars feel in em- 
ploying them, even at this day.” 
When meaning has been “ chiselled” and “fused” from the 
containing mass of words in this way, verbal memorising becomes 
unnecessary. The matter is understood so well that we can give 
it again in our own words, 
But, we may be inclined to think, this way of studying will take 
so much time. We shall get through our study more quickly by 
the old way of—cramming. Yes, but with what results? With 
no results whatever, except harmful ones; not even, nowadays, 
examination results. Lessons which are crammed are only remem- 
bered for a time ; they are forgotten as soon as tested, if not before. 
Such learning is of no use to student-teachers, whose knowledge is 
needed years after it has been acquired. If understanding is sacri- 
ficed, the mind is totally unaffected for good ; its ability to under- 
stand anything is lessened daily; and students w

    / The Student as Learner 29 
Intelligent study is concerned with ideas. The third factor of 
it, therefore, is the organising of ideas met with in the matter of 
study. Young students are apt to treat these ideas as if they were 
al of equal value. This points to a narrow examination view of 
their work. They say in effect: “I may be asked about any ‘of 
this, so T must know it all equally well.” Older students learn that 
parts of their textbooks may be safely neglected, so far as the 
examination is concerned. Questions on them are never asked. 
But this is because their examiners have realised what they have 
not—that the ideas contained in any book differ in value; and, 
as examiners, they naturally put more emphasis on the more in- 
portant. Now while examiners may be regarded as safe guides to 
what is important in the matter of a textbook set for study,:the 
students who feverishly look up old examination questions and order 
their study by them, are putting their minds in shackles. They 
do not study this or that carefully because their judgment tells 
them it hag an important bearing on their chosen work; but 
simply because they may be asked about it, Their judgment, 
therefore, remains untrained in this particular, and this is a very 
serious thing in the present press of subjects and subject-matter.

~ organising ideas Thring’s warning—“ Lives, not lessons ”"— 
should be the touchstone for their value. When put to this test 
the worth of ideas will be found to vary. greatly. Moreover, they - 
will be dependent for much of their value on other ideas connected 
with them. From this it is clear that they must be studied not in 
isolation but in associated groups. Common experience shows the 
importance of this. Let us take one instance of association to 
make the matter clear. You may enter your classroom one morn- 
ing and find there a fellow-student at work upon a piece of prepara- 
tion which you yourself have forgotten. Taking paper and pen 
to write, in arder to repair your omission, you remember that you 
are without‘a necessary book. This reminds you, in turn, that you 
lent it to another student ; and the thought of him calls. up a further 
thought of his illness which has prevented him from returning it. 
You pass then from the thought of his illness. to the thought of its 
nature,. This bringsalonganotherassociated thought, the prevalence
-P-A-G-E-43
30 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
of that particular form of illness, and it, again, connects itself with 
a thought of the weather, the apparent cause of it. As the weather 
may be threatening to interfere with your favourite sport or a 
prospective picnic, your thoughts may here take another turn. 
Thus, you have been led on from one to another—from that of an 
omitted task to that of a book—a friend—his illness—its preval- 
ence—its cause—other effects of the same cause ; and you may be 
led further and further till the entry of your taskmaster or task- 
mistress, with a, brisk request for test books, snaps the connecting 
thread of thought with an unpleasant jar. But examine that 
connecting thread: what is it? The “association of ideas.” And 
how easily it drew you! Quite involuntarily you followed it— 
indeed, not only without but against your will, or at least away 
from your intention, which was to do your forgotten exercise. 
Well, it is in this way that the ideas gained in study act, and you 
may tell whether you gathered ideas, or words merely during a 
study by their doing or failing to do so when you try to recall it. 
But how easily, then, thoughts may wander in study—wander 
from it! Yes, and how easily they do, and how often, unless 
there is a will strengthened by exercise to insist on their centring, 
for the time being, in the matter of study—to insist on concen- 
tration. : 
Of course the path had been prepared, by connections previously 
made, for the little mind-journey traced in the foregoing paragraph. 
Now, it is part of the work of study to prepare similar paths for 
newly-presented ideas, arranging them in such connected order on 
their entry into the mind that when an effort is made to recall them 
they follow as readily the one upon another as your thoughts slipped 
along the thread of associated ideas from a borrowed book to a 
prospective picnic in danger of being spoilt by the weather. Ideas 
stored away together in the mind are recalled together. It was 
because, on hearing of the illness of your fellow-student, you in- 
quired as to its nature and received the answer with some such 
exclamations as “ That’s the fifth student down with influenza— 
small wonder, this weather!” and “ Bother! he has my Julius 
Cesar,” that your thoughts of these things followed so pat on 
one another.

page, is the next necessary factor of study. The proces: OQ

_inust_he to-determine-their val value, “As depends on their relation 
to other ideas, we cannot judge of it until we know what other 
ideas are contained in the matter to be studied. At this point we 
will cease to think of the whole subject of study, or even of the 
book used for it, as these present too many ideas to be taken in at 
one sitting, and consider only the chapter, pages or passage set-— 
by the student himself or his teacher—to occupy one study-period. 
At the same time it should be remembered that, in all good writing, 
the subject-matter is related from beginning to end, and that the 
best way of attacking literature set for study is to read the story, 
essay, play or poem straight through first, for the purpose of 
gathering the leading ideas. The same plan must be followed, 
whatever the subject, in dealing with the matter of any single 
study. Here it may be well to emphasize that as study is meant 
to be a gathering of related ideas it should be set by topics, not by 
amount, the student being required to learn certain things, not so 
much. 
When the leading ideas have been grasped-by.azeading.through _ 
of the subject-matter, the. first step in organising them hasbeen 
taken, The second is to examine them wi 
Blasizing those “of most importance, ‘and gi attenti 
others im lessening degree as their va We” és; for, having — 
“atktiowledged that ideas differ in’ value, we “oil be foolish to 
distribute our time and attention equally among them. “ All 
statement of thought gathers negligible words as wheat produces 
straw and chaff” (Professor McMurry in How to Study). Such 
words are used in opening remarks, in changes of subject and in 
attempts to keep the interest of the reader; and the organising 
of ideas demands the relative neglect of them, for it is only by this 
means that the mind can retain those of greater moment. Ruskin 
had this in mind when in his lecture “ Of Kings’ Treasuries,” 
he said that a man’s best work was “ mixed always with evil frag- 
ments—ill-done, redundant, affected work.” Books, of course, 
differ considerably—according to their purpose—in the amount of 
their negligible matter. Bacon drew attention to the fact when 
he wrote : “‘ Some books are to -be tasted, others to be swallowed,    
   
-P-A-G-E-45
32 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
and some few to be chewed and digested ; that is, some books are 
to be read only in parts, others to be read but not curiously, and 
some few to bé read wholly and with diligence and attention ” (Of 
Studies: Everyman’s edition, p. 150). Two trustworthy guides, 
therefore—themselves earnest students and great writers—advise 
you in reading and studying to advance rapidly in some places by 
skipping, as well as-to go slowly—marking, learning, and digesting as 
you read—in others. A modern writer emphasizes the same neces- 
sity: “There is a notion of thoroughness,” he remarks, “ which 
insists on attention to details, and tends to obscure the relative 
values of things. True thoroughness is a matter of quality, not 
of quantity. Real thoroughness requires a constant, exéftise~gf 
judgment, anda. high degree of good sense.” oe 
The verdict passed on the value of ideas gathered from any 
passage should be shown in a written abstract made in a notebook 
for the sake of saving time in revision for examination purposes. 
This abstract should give the chief ideas met with, each con- 
nected with as many minor related ones as it seems advisable to 
remember. 
Only good students get even so far in the organisation of ideas, 
and it is necessary to go farther. A vigorous self-questioning 
should next be instituted : What are the main ideas in the passage ? 
Do I understand them? Can I express them clearly? Can I 
illustrate them by examples? Such questioning is of more value 
than memorising at this point. Only when all the answers are 
satisfactory should this second step in study be regarded as com- 
pleted. 
As we read thoughtfully in any book of sufficient merit thé ideas 
in it stir kindred ideas in our own minds, giving rise to a train of 
thought suggested by the author’s words, though not actually 
expressed by them. This supplementing of the author’s thought 
by our own is a fourth necessary factor of s ~

must come to them with : 
“,..a true desire to be taught by them and enter into their 
thoughts. To enter into them, observe ;—not to find your own ex- 
pressed by them. If the person who wrote the book is not wiser 
than you, you need not read it. If he be, he will think differently 
from you in many respects.” 
But, though we should read and study books-in order to enter 
into their authors’ thoughts and not to find our own, we must read 
with the intention of stirring the latter into activity ; for it is only 
by so doing that we can take in the new ones which are put before 
us. By supplementing an author’s ideas with our own awe. are find:

learn from us much in the same way as we—and they upon occasion 
—learn from books.

is clearly of the greatest importance in the matter of remembering 
them. Our concern just, therefore, be to strengthen their-chances 
of recall by increasing the number of their associated ideas, and we 
may do so by both mechanical and intelligent means. 
Mechanical devices for aiding memory are more in place in 
subjects which require a good deal of mechanical effort ; and one 
or two examples connected with elementary subjects may be help- 
ful in suggesting others. The sounding of words in the English 
language is very irregular ; and the mechanical side of reading gives, 
on this account, considerably more trouble than in the case of 
Dutch, in which a closer relation exists between sign and sound. 
The lists of words enclosed below represent two black-board 
schemes, the one made without any regard for mechanical associa- 
tion, and the other with the intention of getting all possible help 
from it.

be considered hard for the class (Standard IT) are omitted because 
of the impossibility of teaching them all in one lesson. In those 
taken, special attention is drawn to the particular difficulty they 
present. ‘There is the same number of words on each board ; but 
there can be no doubt that more words will be learnt from the 
second, because the impression made by the arrangement is so much 
clearer. It may be noticed that if we were attempting to associate 
ideas the former blackboard scheme would be the more useful, but 
such a method of association would be of no use in teaching the 
sounds of words. In teaching and studying we need to have de- 
finite notions both of what, we want to do and what we do not want 
to do, and to prepare our work accordingly. 
As another example of the aid of mechanical association in 
teaching, a helpful treatment of the nine times multiplication table 
may be instanced. Examining the various products 0, 9, 18, 27, 
36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81, 90, 99, and 108, we find the units figures after 
the first cypher diminishing by one to the next cypher from which 
the process repeats, and the tens figures increasing similarly from 
the 1 of 18 to the 10 of 108. Moreover, the sum of the digits in the 
case of all but 99 (in which it is 18 or twice 9) is 9. When these 
facts have been pointed out to children they have no need to spend 
time in laboriously committing the table to memory. 
elqeiency mm life and action—-and we must follow the subject farther 
to see how that end is to be achieved. 
Ideas when acquired must be put into use, With this end in 
view TREY HRS be examined from one standpoint and from another, 
and students must question themselves on them and exercise them- 
selves in using them both actually and in imagination. The ideas 
gathered from this book, for example, should be considered in 
relation to imaginary classes during study, and tested by actual 
practice during teaching. 
Studies vary ;_ and the ways 0 of of using | ideas gained vary with the 
study. We should not narrow our aetion OF at is meant by 
usmig ideas till it excludes everything but a few school activities, or 
these will limit our aim. Ideas are used when any increase in 
efficiency or any enrichment of life results from them. The purpose 
of studying singing, for example, is as truly fulfilled when a good 
song well sung gives pleasure to parents, friends, or fellow-students lemorising is the last of the processes of study which, wi

as when a certificate is won ; of studying handicrafts, when some 
simple want of the home is supplied as when a set of school exercises 
is completed ; of studying literature, when the emotions raised find 
expression in an act of kindness, courage or self-sacrifice, as much 
as when a prize essay is written. 
But studies vary in other respects also. Some are accomplished 
when by conscious effort we can translate our knowledge into power, 
as when, having learnt to read, we can get an author’s thoughts 
from his writings ; or when, having learnt to carve in wood, we 
can make, within the limits of our tools and materials, such things 
as we desire ; or when, having studied in history the relations be- 
tween England and France in the eighteenth century, we can give 
to a class nourishing and quickening ideas of that great rivairy. In 
other subjects of study, knowledge must become so much more 
closely a part of us that it can be used unconsciously. Not hard 
work only, but time ; not time alone, but unceasing effort must go 
to the gaining of this unconscious control. Understanding comes 
first, then power to use with effort, and at last, after hard, unremit- 
ting labour, the unconscious habit. 
Though we may consider the objects of our study attained when 
it is possible for us to use with ease and freedom—and, if necessary, 
unconsciously—the ideas gained from it, there is another matter of 
importance to be considered-—namely, our attitude towards what 
we have learnt. We have only to think of old theories, old doctrines 
and old beliefs now discarded, to realise that the worth of gathered 
ideas changes from time to time with the discovery of new truth. 
As their value should be one of the deciding factors in our storing 
of ideas, it should influence also our retaining of them. We should 
not cling to ideas simply because we once thought them valuable, 
without examining the evidence in favour of new thought. To do 
so is to resist all advance, and often to be guilty of folly, injustice 
and cruelty. History has countless examples to show of persecu- 
tions arising out of this tendency of human nature. We need not 
go far back in order to recall instances of the opposition roused in a| 
passing generation by the ideas and inventions of a younger one, as, 
for example, the objection of the grandfathers of the present genera- 
tion to railway trains and to the newer methods of farming, or, 
more lately still, the replacing of horses by motor traction,

In no branch of knowledge is this more necessary than in that which 
is concerned with education ; and’at no time has the necessity of 
keeping our study of educational theory and practice up-to-date 
been more urgent than now. - 
Another question remains to be considered—that of developing 
our-own itherecit ch study... Ea ap 
whi ecum oF all our talents and aptitudes, our inclinations 
and possibilities, our likes and dislikes, our thoughts and actions, 
our ways of looking at things and our ways of doing things; and 
it is our duty to develop and perfect it. It is one of the purposes 
of our education through study to find our niche and to fit ourselves 
into it. Pope tells us that the proper study of mankind is man ; 
and there can be no more proper branch of it for each one of us 
than that which discovers to us ourselves, which enables us to 
judge our possibilities and sets us to the work of fulfilling them. 
It i as beer Sald-that an. educated person_is one who knows 
“something about everything and everything about something.” 
Taree howere, was frst given before the twentieth cen 
tury had revealed such a multiplicity of things to know something 
about, and so much to know about every one of them. However 
that may be, it makes a good working guide to those of us who are 
interested, as all teachers must be, in the matter of self-culture. 
It suggests that there is a large body of knowledge about which we 
must of necessity know as much as our profession demands in order 
that we may teach it. This it is which is outlined by our examina- 
tion syllabuses. Over and above this, there is for each one of us 
some branch of knowledge or skill in which, by reason of special 
aptitude or inclination, it is possible for us to make ourselves to 
some extent experts and specialists. In this way we may add to 
the “ all round” education essential for teachers some outstanding 
power that will give us distinction in our profession, to our own 
pleasure and the profit of our pupils. Having examined our in- 
clinations and aptitudes with a view to discovering the subjects 
in which we may wisely specialise, we should give as much time as 
we can spare from class studies to developing our power with regard

to them. We may be of those who, through interest in facts and 
objects and natural phenomena, are drawn towards science ; we 
may be idea-lovers, with a bent towards literature, history and 
music ; or we may find our greatest pleasure in studying to obtain 
skill in some manual art. We should specialise in the field of 
greatest promise for our individual tastes and talents, and in all 
cases remember to specialise not merely as students of the subjects 
but also as teachers of them. 
‘The_members_of a class—whether of students or children—

istic ways, the first would wish to have it in an open book before

the third would wish to write it out or declaim it with action. Some 
students again are stimulated to greater activity of mind by dis- 
cussion—or even opposition—and the competitive effort of class- 
mates ; others, when they have to master new knowledge like to get 
away by themselves to solve their problems. All these considera- 
tions should be taken into account in studying and teaching. Our 
inclinations in studying, and our pupils’ in learning, should not be 
over-indulged, nor should our chief mode of mind-activity be exer- 
cised to the exclusion of others from the neglect of which we should 
suffer, At the same time common-sense demands that, if one 
manner of learning is easier to us than others, we should chiefly 
use that and so ensure the best results with the least expenditure 
of time and effort.

very foundation of all our work. Whether we think of ourselves 
primarily as students or as teachers, it is impossible to overrate our 
need to be skilful in fitting on the one hand ideas to language, and 
on the other language to ideas. In a country where the languages 
of two different nations and of two different races are heard side by 
side, the difficulty of mastering the medium of instruction, great

enough in ordinary circumstances, is more than doubled. We have 
only to listen to the language of classroom and playground to 
realise how much effort is needed to make educated speech a com- 
mon possession—as it should be—of the students and teachers of 
South Africa. If the effort is not made, education itself must 
suffer; for “ want of language, want of words filled with clear 
definite meaning, is the greatest hindrance to culture.” Here is a 
cause worthy of the devotion of every teacher and of every student 
in the country—to discourage by all possible means, both in class 
. and out of it, the use of slovenly speech resulting from a laziness of 
mind that accepts the first word that presents itself, whether it is 
from the language in which the sentence was begun or from another 
partially known, and carries over from one to the other the idioms 
and grammatical constructions peculiar to either; to cultivate a 
feeling for the dignity, beauty and worth of words that have gathered 
their meaning and chosen their ways through centuries of history ; 
) and to urge upon pupils and fellow-students by precept and example 
' the righteousness of rendering them their due in careful speech. 
As language is_the fundamental instrument of education, so 
child Sudy_ is its fun ental matter. In this study “the text: 
book is the child living out his life before us. The legend which 
, — invites us to it is written in the poetry of free and natural child 
| life.” 
It is not given to all of us to keep the key of the garden of child- 
_ hood in our possession when we pass beyond its bounds. Yet we 
¢ must by some means re-enter it when we are preparing to become 
teachers of children ; for how shall we help them to become what 
' they may be, if we have no knowledge of What they are?” "OU Best 
' guides in this matter will be those few fortunate members of the 
grown-up world who have never lost their power to get back into 
the garden—Charles Lamb, whose “ Dream Children” have all the 
} pretty looks and words and ways of real ones ; Charles Kingsley, 
whose Water Babies” havesuffered no more thana sea-changesince 
they were land ones; Lewis Carroll, who showedus “ Alicein Wonder- 
land ” and “Through the Looking Glass ” ; Robert Louis Stevenson, 
whose “Child’s Garden of Verses” sings for us the very songs of 
happy childhood; Rudyard Kipling, who has given us their “ Jungle 
Books” and “ Just So Stories” and Dan and Una learning history 
, from that best of history teachers “ Puck of Pook’s Hill” ; lastly,

grow up with the other boys and Wendy—to the children who teach 
us to know the real world children we have to deal with. Perhaps 
some of you will be inclined to exclaim that real children are not 
like these-—are less delightful and not so good—but until we can see 
the reality of childhood through the eyes of these child-lovers, we 
are no fit teachers for any children. 
We should make ourselves familiar, too, with the best pictures 
of children which reveal so much childlikeness to eyes that need 
the painter’s brush to show it. 
But portraiture, whether by word or line, should be regarded as 
only a preliminary to real child study, which should concern itself 
with the living children who are to be found at home and at school, 
in classroom and playground, in street and park and in the real 
country. To this study the children themselves invite us. Every 
shy confidence opens a little wider for us, as we turn back to it, the 
gate of the garden of childhood, from within which we may hear 
mingling with the children’s voices the voice of a forgotten self 
calling 
“Come in awhile, and play with me— 
I am the little child you used to be.”
-P-A-G-E-54
- CHAPTER III 
THE STUDENT AS TEACHER 
“O’er wayward childhood wouldst thou hold firm rule, 
And sun thee in the light of happy faces, 
Love, Hope and Patience, these must be thy graces, 
And in thine own heart let them first keep school.”—COoLERIDGE. 
“In striving to influence the growing child for good, we must ever beware 
of exerting an wdue influence. The child’s point of view shduld be his own. 
Even though some restraint is necessary, freedom to develop is even more 
necessary. .. He. should preserve his own individuality.”—E. READ MUMFoRD. 
‘©No machine-made system of teaching can ever be right. ‘he best of 
methods must be modulated by human insight, sympathy and tact.”—K appa. 
“Thosé only wield the full power of education who know how to cultivate 
in the youthful soul a large circle of thought closely connected in all its parts, 
possessing the power of overcoming what is unfavourable in the environment, 
and of dissolving and absorbing into itself what is favourable.’—HRBarT. 
WHILE one or two “born teachers” are to be found in almost 
every class of students, the majority, there can be no doubt, have 
taken up the work of teaching without any compelling conviction 
of an inborn capacity for it. They need not, however, be downcast 
or discouraged on this account. The born teacher will be happier 
with his class and more at home in teaching at first ; but, given one 
condition, any student can make of himself as time goes on a teacher 
who is both happy and successful in his work. The one essential 
condition is the determination—whether from simple honesty or 
a sense of “the high utility” of the calling—to become a good 
teacher. 
Most people when asked what should be the first qualification 
of a teacher reply: “A love of children.” Now, while a love of children is not felt naturally by everyone, it can be cultivated by 42 
¢ 
.
-P-A-G-E-55
42 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
every teacher—not, best, by saying, “‘ 1 must love these children,” 
but by acting in a way to bring the feeling to birth. All who have 
chosen to be teachers must be ready to admit that they have duties 
towards the pupils placed in their charge. These duties can only 
be properly performed when the teachers feel an interest in their 
pupils. This interest may at first be non-existent, and it cannot be 
forced into being. It springs naturally, however, out of an attitude 
of mind—attention—which is under the control of the will. Teachers 
who make themselves aiiend to their pupils—to their looks and 
feelings, their words and ways—will gain a knowledge of them that 
awakens interest. Interest and knowledge will react on each other 
and understanding grow from them. With understanding comes 
sympathy, and out of sympathy, love. Once the beginning is 
made, all follows as naturally as growth in a flower. But attention, 
the frame of mind in which the others are rooted, if not involuntarily 
yielded, must be given by an effort of will. We must sow our seed 
if we would reap our harvest. 
There is a facile love of children which spends itself in “ gush- 
ing ” or indulges itself in indulging them. The teacher’s love 
must be different from this—must be strong, patient, disciplined, 
broad in its foundations, “impossible to be overturned” ; 
deep-seated, yet with the play of light upon it ; shown not only 
in sacrifice but also in smiles. If it is of the right kind it will make 
heavy demands upon ourselves in all that concerns our work. 
It will insist upon self-management as a preliminary to class or 
school management, and will be content with nothing less than 
our mastery of the art of teaching. Let us take these require- 
ments one by one. 
Our “ self,” as it affects our pupils, has several aspects—person, 
voice, speech and manner, mind, character. All must be discip- 
lined. That we must conform to the standard of cleanliness, neat- 
ness and good taste in dress, expected of all educated people, goes 
without saying. We should, moreover, remember the pleasure of 
children, especially little children and girls, in bright colours and 
pretty things, and, keeping within the limits of what is suitable 
and serviceable, should try to indulge it. By such care we shall not 
only please the eye of our pupils, but also influence their conduct, 
They find it easier to fall in with the wishes of teachers who, as they 
would express it, “look nice.” This “ looking nice” is very little 
a matter of natural endowment and very much a matter of what  
-P-A-G-E-56
a aes 
The Student as Teacher 43 
we make of ourselves. It is concerned with dress, carriage, 
movement and expression, and is within the power of all who 
give time and thought to making the best of themselves in these , 
particulars. , 
We should subject our speaking voice and our teaching voice - 
to constant criticism. Both in ordinary conversation with our 
pupils and during lessons we should cultivate pleasantness of tone 
and check any tendency to loudness and harshness. It is a good 
plan to try to recall, between one session and another, the sound of 
, our voice and pass judgment on it, making recommendations for 
future improvement. We shall find it worth while, for there is a 
very close connection between discipline and the teacher’s‘voice. 
The importance of clear, correct and pleasant speech has been 
pointed out. Effort should be ceaseless until this is attained. A 
, good manner is equally important—a manner that seems naturally 
firm and cheerful without that too determined brightness under 
| which many children turn restive. An easy manner is wanted, for 
the school day is long for little folk, and there is a good deal of nerve 
strain attendant on the work. “As teachers of young children we 
must, in the words of one pre-eminent lover of them, “ perform our 
duties with laughter and kind faces ; with courage, gaiety and the 
quiet mind, letting cheerfulness abound with our industry, going 
blithely on our business all the day.” This is, indeed, the first of 
our duties—to meet the gladness of their morning faces when they 
| are glad with responsive smiles; when they look doubtfully on 
{ the day, to reassure them ; when they are clouded with childish 
| grief or pain, to console and cheer them. 
( Our discipline of mind must be a steady cultivation and train- 
ing of it for the sake of our pupils and our work. No narrow 
examination end should be our goal; but the mastering of each 
subject set for study in order that we ourselves may come to feel 
that “ many-sided interest ” which we must awaken in the children 
} we teach. In some subjects, no doubt, we feel little’or no interest. 
To these we must, to begin with, attend the more determinedly. 
. Knowledge and interest will reward us—a little knowledge at first 
+ and some interest ; then more knowledge and more interest, and 
more and more and more. It is in the beginning only that subjects 
are dull, and we must have passed this first stage before we can 
hope to teach with any success. Our task is nothing less than to 
bring our pupils to a realisation of the beauty and wonder of the
-P-A-G-E-57
44 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
universe ; to teach them that in spite of sorrow, pain and evil, Life 
is good. In their own childish language 
“ The world is so full of a number of things, 
I’m sure we should all be as happy.as kings.” 
Here speaks the natural child, the child “‘ under school age.” Does 
he seem as sure of it as he sits in the class to which our modern edu- 
cational system has brought him ? Too frequently “a number of 
things » that hitherto have made him glad have disappeared in a 
mist of unfamiliar words which he learns to call lessons. To keep 
alive in the heart of little children the gladness of living, to bring 
to rebirth in older ones in whom it has not survived early childhood, 
their sense of the wonder of the world, these are the tasks for which 
the discipline and training of our mind must fit us. 
-- The aim of education is character-forming. It is only character 
that forms character, and it forms it after its own kind. Whatever 
faults we would have our pupils guiltless of —cruelty, injustice, dis- 
honesty, lying—we must hate in all our being. Whatever virtue 
we wish them to practise or possess—kindness, honesty, truth- 
fulness, industry ; a sense of duty, of justice, of honour—we must 
show in all our dealing. In constant training of our own personal 
character lies our only hope of influencing our pupils for good. 
Class, management must each day begin before class assembles. 
Much of the success of the day’s teaching and discipline depends * 
on the preparation made. for it in the ten minutes which every 
teacher should try to secure in his classroom before school work 
begins. The glance round the room to see that it has been properly 
cleaned since the last session; the glance at the windows to see 
that they are opened or closed as the state of the weather demands, ; 
at the blinds to see that they are in good working order and raised 
or lowered as the light requires ; the getting out of all books and 
apparatus needed not for the first lesson only, but for all that come 4 
before recess—all these make for order and good work. 
In these few minutes the class monitors should be busy in the 
room seeing that everything of which they have the supervision is | 
in order, and as the time offers a good opportunity for a little | 
informal intercourse between teacher and children, not monitors ; 
only, but all who come early to school should be admitted. 
The class monitorship should not be left to choice, but given 
to each pupil in turn, because all children have to be trained 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
The Student as Teacher - 45 
to responsibility ; and, if any are ignorant of the pleasures of 
usefulness, they stand in greater need of being taught to enjoy 
them. As a general rule children take great pride in their monitor- 
ship, and there is seldom need to call their attention to neglect ; but 
we should always be aware of the manner in which they are 
carried out and give to special care a word of commendation. Where 
carelessness is apparent, a little good-humoured raillery is usually 
effective in banishing it ; but, of course, there are children who have 
not learnt to find pleasure in helping others, and we must be pre- 
pared to deal with them. It is better to-take away a monitorship 
in such cases, by way of reproof, than to insist’ on its being held 
for a longer period. Of course we must manage to make the 
deprivation felt, and it should be only temporary. Children are 
not hardened criminals ; and there should be no life sentences in 
dealing with them. When their turn comes round again, the 
delinquents should not be passed over, but be given another chance. 
The few minutes spent in the classroom before school may be 
made a time of very real help to the children, not only by estab- 
lishing less formal relations with the teacher than lesson-time 
permits, but by offering opportunity for such self-chosen work as 
provides far more enjoyment than does aimless idling about the 
school premises. A class is in a good way when the members of it 
like to come early to school, and, on getting there, set cheerfully 
about whatever they may wish to do—one renewing the flowers, 
one copying some verse of a poem felt to be too good to be for- 
gotten, one reading a book or a magazine from the classroom 
shelves, one, it may be, studying a picture with a future compesi- 
tion in view. In these minutes talking should be unrestricted, as 
long as it is low-toned ; and the children should feel that they may 
use them to get-needed help from the teacher or from each other. 
Occasionally the teacher may be glad to use the time in reading 
some poem or some passage of a book to which reference has been 
made in a previous lesson, or in showing pictures or an experiment 
for which the thirty minutes allotted by the time-table gave no 
opportunity. : 
A classroom which is to prove attractive to the children must 
have, of course, a certain amount of care expended’ on it. The 
notice board—to begin with a very important item of classroom 
furniture—should either be big enough to leave space to spare 
after all necessary time-tables, syllabuses and class lists have been
-P-A-G-E-59
46 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
affixed, or be supplemented by a second one. The spare space on 
the board should be used for bringing to the notice of the children 
any pictures, printed matter or written notices which may serve 
to widen and increase their interests. 
The method of fixing is important. “Notices” which, pre- 
cariously attached by a bent pin, flap in every breeze, or, becoming 
detached, flutter from point to point on the floor, add nothing to 
the appearance or interest and much to the distractions of a class- 
room. All papers should be firmly secured by their four corners ; 
and for further safety the board should be placed out of the way of 
draughts. ‘ 
Rightly used, a notice board may be made a means of making the 
children keener about their work, and of extending their interests 
indefinitely, The better magazines and illustrated weeklies, copies 
of which can be frequently, even if not regularly borrowed, are 
filled with portraits of famous men and women, and pictures 
beautiful in themselves or interesting for their bearing on history, 
nature-study or geography. Newspapers, again, will furnish para- 
graphs and occasional columns that refer to something that has 
come up for discussion in the classroom. In fact, so much of educa- 
tional interest is published nowadays, that our chief difficulty 
will be one of selection. This is a matter requiring some thought 
and system. As a general rule no portrait, picture or paragraph 
should be put on the board unless we have reason to believe that 
the subject of it has already found an entry into the children’s 
minds. Each one, that is, should have been previously intro- 
duced, unless we feel it to be of sufficient importance to spend 
some minutes in bringing it to our pupils’ notice before making 
a place for it on the board. The children themselves should 
be encouraged to contribute ; and, while. it is possible that at 
first picture post-cards will prove to be the bulk of their con- 
tributions, it is surprising how great a variety of “notices”? will 
be furnished by them when once they have begun to ketp their eyes 
open. We shall find, too, that the habit of gleaning in likely 
and unlikely places results in a very considerable harvest, and 
we shall come to see more and more how much may be brought from 
outside the classroom to broaden the minds and widen the interests 
of our pupils. : 
But a word of warning is needed. The contributions of the 
children must be censored, for their taste and judgment are still

ae The Student as Teacher 47 
undergoing training. The fixtures, too, if they are to keep’ their 
value must be frequently changed, for out-of-date notices are as 
stimulating tothe intelligence as is a jar of withered flowers to the 
sense of beauty. Pictures and portraits which have more than a 
temporary interest should not be kept long on the board, but should 
be removed to a cupboard or drawer and there kept carefully for 
future use. If the children feel sure of finding something inter- 
esting and up to date on the notice board, they will get into the 
habit of examining it daily. From-time to time we should call 
attention to the more important fixtures, and endeavour by a little, 
informal questioning to discover how far they have served their 
purpose. 
Frequently we firid that the only relief to the eye on classroom 
walls is afforded by maps and object-lesson sheets. However 
useful these may be, they cannot claim to be ornamental enough to 
take the place of pictures ; and when, as is often the case, they 
become torn from their rollers, and, in that condition, are allowed to 
hang askew, they are positive eyesores, and silent forces, moreover, 
of disorder and harmful influence. 
It is a question whether the number of wall map and lesson- 
sheets in many schools is not in excess of the children’s needs. In 
lower classes, plans and maps have much more educational value 
when they are drawn in the presence of the children during the 
course of their lessons. In the upper standards a good atlas in 
the hands of each child offers greater freedom for consultation, 
and, supplemented by the teacher’s sketch maps, does away to a 
large extent with the necessity for the ordinary physical and poli- 
tical wall maps, which are awkward to place and a burden to remove. 
The right method of nature study, again, is almost independent of 
lesson charts. If, however, it is felt that they cannot be done 
without, they might be stored, neatly rolled and tied, in some 
convenient place, as, for example, on the bottom shelf of the class 
cupboard, space being thus made for good pictures. 
Much has been done of late years to bring more books and better 
books within reach of our public elementary schools, and some- 
thing is being done to make it possible for reproductions of some 
of the best pictures to find their way to our classroom walls. In 
choosing pictures for a classroom it has to be remembered that it is 
not enough that they should be good pictures ; they must also be 
suited to the children occupying the room. Those which are suit-

pictures. In such cases, it should not be difficult to find means c

classrooms the advice “ Neither a borrower nor a lender be” may b

who are so fond of books that they wish to spend sc

Home Reading Magazine, The Nature Study Monthly, and one good 
illustrated weekly suggest themselves as suitable. 
The matter of class control must now be considered. We may 
distinguish between two forms of control—‘ government” and 
“ discipline ”--giving the former name to the teacher’s manage- 
ment of the class, and reserving the latter for self-control exercised 
by the pupils. Government is proper in the case of junior pupils, 
but from the outset it must have for its aim the substituting of 
discipline as soon as pupils are of an age to exercise it. - 
Our constant endeavour in controlling a class must be to 
prevent breaches of order, not only because of their bad effect on 
the work of the school, but also because of the harm they do to the 
children who are guilty of them. The child who has once heen 
naughty finds it harder to be good after his fault than before it. 
Repeated faults and naughty acts make, as it were, a pathway for 
themselves through the field of the child’s consciousness, and 
pathways are easier to follow than untrodden ground. It becomes 
a duty, then, of us who have charge of children to try to find out 
why they are naughty that we may, when it is possible to do so, 
remove the cause and so prevent the fault, prevention being, for 
the reasons given above, very much better than punishment. 
The matter of behaviour is closely: bound up with the matters of 
‘interest and attention. Most breaches of discipline in class begin 
in the inattention which results from want of interest in the work 
being done. It will be helpful here, therefore, to state the chief 
laws governing interest and attention, illustrating them by examples 
such as any teacher’s experience will furnish. 
We may begin with the theory of. interest put forward by a 
German educationalist, Herbart, whose teachings have of late years 
greatly influenced school practice. He points out that any attempt 
to interest children artificially during lessons is due to a misunder- 
standing of the relation between interest and knowledge. He tells 
us that we must not think of interest as something outside of know- 
ledge that must be added to it, as jam is added to a powder in 
order that it may be more readily taken in, but as something that 
grows out of knowledge itself. He says, in effect: “‘ Make a thing 
known to children and you will make it interesting—or rather it 
will make itself interesting.” 
In this connection, however, we must remember that we can 
only make a thing known to children by teaching in accordance 
D

with the laws which govern their minds’ growth and actior 
children, as we have seen, have little power of graspin 
tions. It will be of no use then to try to make arithn 
interesting to them by giving more examples and teaching

let us say, the story of a shipwrecked crew of so mar. 
away on an island with provision for so many days only, and 
asking how much sooner they will need to be rescued if their number 
is increased by so many more, we shall find that the boys work 
with greater zest, and so more correctly. 
As soon as our pupils begin to feel ir 
attend without any effort of will, though 
have had to make themselves attend in orc! 
lesson creditably. This brings us to a dis 
two kinds of attention—voluntary, as, for 
our pupils to their arithmetic before the s!: 
brought into it ; and znvoluntary, that which they gave when their 
minds were set on finding out how soon the crew must be :: 
We all know perfectly well what is meant by “ payiny 
tion,” yet, perhaps, have never considered the exact a 
operations performed in doing so. Let us use one of the class of 
boys intent on their problem for the purpose. His mind the 
moment before we roused him to interest in the shipwrecked crew 
was not empty. Minds never are empty during waking hours : ~ 
“Some kind of consciousness is always going on. This con- 
sciousness is not simple but complex; not a mere trickle of 
thoughts entering our minds one after the other, . . . but-a full 
stream... . At any one moment the contents of our minds, our 
‘field of consciousness ’ at that moment, contain impressio: 
ceived through the senses, memories of things which have 
pened in the past, recollections of objects which are not besi

or something quite outside ourselves, impressions of bodily move-

ment or inactivity, of comfort or the reverse, these together forming 
a whole which is our “‘ field or state of consciousness,” the contents 
of our minds at that particular moment.” (E. Read Mumford in 
The Dawn of Character.) 
The boy we have chosen for purposes of illustration is at the 
moment, let us say, drumming his fingers soundlessly on his desk ; 
but this bodily movement is not engaging his attention ; he is 
almost unconscious of it. Many things at the same moment are 
making impressions on his consciousness just as faintly—the 
ticking of the clock, the hum of work from a neighbouring class, 
the warmth of the room, a shaft of sunlight striking across his 
desk. A cut finger is giving him a feeling of discomfort ; a pro- 
mised treat is. enticing his thoughts from his lesson. It is depen- 
dent on the weather, and involuntarily he turns his eyes to the 
patch of sky visible through the window. The action brings 
into view the antics of a mischievous child in the next class, and 
he feels inclined to laugh. He hears his teacher give the order to 
open books. Half-mechanically he performs the act of finding 
the place. Then the door opens and the head master enters. With 
the rest of the class our boy rises and says “ Good-morning, Sir” ; 
but still his mind is thronged by many sensations, recollections, 
thoughts, and not given wholly to any one thing. It chances, 
however, that he is called out by the head master ; and, instantly, 
everything hitherto occupying his mind gives place to the uneasy 
inquiry “What have I been doing?” This calls up in review 
all his late acts and omissions, among which he expects to find one 
to which the: head of the school may have taken exception. But 
Nemesis passes him by. He is wanted only to give some par- 
ticulars for an examination schedule. “He returns to his place, 
and in the relief of the moment determines to attend. The 
“Method of Unity,” however, fails when treated in the abstract 
to maintain a place in his mind, and this is fast becoming a field 
of such consciousness as existed before the head master came in, 
when the concrete statement of an example lends new interest to 
it. Setting to work on the problem, he finds that it begins to 
occupy his mind to the exclusion of all else. 
Our boy has passed through four changes of mind as regards 
attention—namely : (1) Inattention to his lesson with some in- 
voluntary attention to what is going on around him; (2) Con-
-P-A-G-E-65
52 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
centration of Attention on his late misdemeanours ; (3) Voluntary 
Alitention, during his spasm of relief, to the lesson he had been 
neglecting ; (4) Involuntary Attention to the concrete problem and 
the working involved. 
We may now gather up the main psychological facts illus- 
trated in this sketch of the contents, during some minutes, of a 
boy’s mind. 
“ The proportion of the different elements in our mind—sensations 
of touch or sight or hearing—of memories, of emotions, etc., varies 
from time to time according to circumstances.” (E. Read Mumford 
in The Dawn of Character.) 
At any one moment, however, there is generally something in 
our minds of which we are more conscious than of the rest of the 
impressions being made upon it. In the same way when looking 
at some particular object in a room or scene we see it most clearly, 
but are aware of other furnishings or features. The object on which 
our eyes are fixed is said to be the “ focus” of our vision. Simi- 
larly, the sensation, emotion, or thought which fixes our attention 
is said to be the focus of our consciousness ; all the rest, away from 
this centre, constitutes the “ margin.” Of what is in the nearer 
margin of our minds we are, at least, dimly aware ; but of by far 
the greater part of the expériences and impressions that have gone 
to the making of our minds we are, at any given moment, uncon- 
scious. All this is said to exist “ below the threshold of conscious- 
ness.’ Jt is “ out of our minds” for the time being, and must be 
“called to mind ” in some way if we desire to make use of it ; and 
if we, or circumstances, fail to recall it, it will remain “ below the 
threshold,” for all practical purposes non-existent. 
“Whatever occupies the focus one second may not occupy it the 
next. Consciousness changes from moment to moment.” (E. Read 
Mumford in The Dawn of Character.) 
So, in our boy’s mind, the remembrance of certain things he had 
done or left undone, in the farthest margin before his name was 
called, sprang to the focus when he realised that the master wanted 
him. As he returned to his desk it passed into the margin again, 
his lesson, by an effort of will, being brought to the focus. 
“ Voluntary attention is deliberate, and we are conscious of strain
-P-A-G-E-66
The Student as Teacher . 53 
and effort. We are forced to attend voluntarily to objects which are 
less interesting, for the sake of something else. Involuntary atten- 
tion is spontaneous, and we are conscious of no such effort of will. 
Involuntary attention is the basis of the voluntary. Sustained and 
continuous attention is difficult.” (E. Read Mumford in The Dawn 
of Character.) . 
Thus our boy deliberately forcing himself to attend to his 
lesson gave voluntary attention to it. He was not, however, 
equal to the effort required for sustained and contiriuous attention 
and, therefore, was soon inattentive again. This was probably 
because his power of attention had never been trained. 
“ Concentration is an effort, and the habit of concentration is only 
slowly formed.” (E. Read Mumford in The Dawn of Character.) 
Qur illustration has shown us something of the behaviour of 
the mind in regard to interest and attention. Let us take another 
example. 
"We may, on some occasion, have rewarded our class for good 
work in the morning by reading to them for half-an-hour in the 
afternoon ; or, perhaps, may have taken them to a museum or 
picture palace. In such circumstances we are likely to feel that 
we may expect them to behave unusually well for the remainder 
of the school session. They have listened to the reading, we may 
suppose, in an interested silence in which the proverbial pin might 
have been heard to drop; or, at the museum or picture palace 
they have shown the most intense enjoyment, But alas for our 
expectations! For the rest of the afternoon the children are 
naughtier, we think, than we have ever known them, and so dis- 
orderly over school closing that many of them have to be kept in. 
We leave school feeling that it will be a long time before we give our 
pupils another treat, as they have shown themselves so ungrateful 
over this one. 
But the children are not altogether responsible for their be- 
haviour in such a case. Both interest and concentration of attention 
cause strain ; and after strain reaction follows. It is Nature’s way 
of restoring the balance. The very intensity of the children’s 
interest and enjoyment had exhausted interest and attention for 
the time being, and the strain undergone had lessened, temporarily, 
their will power.
-P-A-G-E-67
54 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
How then should we act in such circumstances to avoid a 
painful end to the afternoon’s pleasure—to prevent breaches of 
order which we feel must be punished when they occur? In the 
first :place, if we could choose the time for it, we should put the 
- little treat as late as possible in the day—the last hour or half-hour 
would be best. If, however, as often in the case of visits to museums 
and galleries, the time is fixed for us, we should see on our return 
to school that the lesson following is changed, if necessary, to one 
that does not make anew a heavy demand on the children’s atten- 
tion—writing, preferably from dictation, or singing would serve 
the purpose very well. In either case we should make short work 
of closing school—not keeping our pupils standing and waiting 
while we attend to something that can just as easily be attended 
to after they are gone ; not choosing this time to give long notices 
or a lecture, and not picking the longest hymn and prayer in our 
school-service book. We should also be especially forbearing, 
not visiting offences with severity to show our lively sense of the 
ingratitude of the offenders. If we act thus, we shall probably 
prevent disorder. 
Close attention, if voluntary, is difficult. We should therefore 
give our pupils all the help we can when we require it of them. 
Lessons demanding it—arithmetic, for example—should be given 
as early as possible in the day, and we must not exact it for long 
periods at a time. Silence should be enforced while exercises 
are worked, for distractions must be removed. Individuals may 
need special help in this direction. Harry, say, for instance, is 
a boy who lets his attention be caught away from the work in 
hand by any sound or movement. It will be advisable to send 
him to work in a corner of the room where he will be screened 
from the sight of his classmates and from what is going on 
around him. 
“ The greater the capacity of the child to observe and to be in- 
terested in all that goes on around, the greater the difficulty in learning 
to attend to any one thing in particular ; and therefore the greater the 
necessity of deliberately training the power of concentration,” (E. 
Read Mumford in The Dawn of Character.) 
It is only when we have made attention possible for individual 
children that we shall be justified in blaming them for inattention 
We must remember, too, that atlention in one direction cause
-P-A-G-E-68
The Student as Teacher : 55 
inattention in other directions. If we give the order for books to be 
closed to a class of children at work on a study or exercise, it is 
likely that some of the most industrious will not hear us. Their 
work is in the focus of their minds, and if our order penetrates 
them at all, it remains in the farthest margin, and only impresses 
itself faintly on their consciousness. If in such a case we were 
to punish or reprove the children who went on with their work, 
they might reasonably think us unjust. We must make sure 
before giving the order that the children’s attention is withdrawn 
from their work. This can be done by saying the name of the 
class and giving a preliminary warning in some such words as : 
“ Listen, all of you,” “ Stop work,” or, simply, “ Altention.” We 
should speak, not loudly, but in a voice that carries weight, and 
is not easy to disregard ; and we should see that all are attending 
before we go on to our order. . 
Observance on our part of the laws governing attention and 
interest will do much to prevent neglect of work and the disorder 
arising out of it; but other conditions enter into the question of 
good class management, and a strong leaven of commonsense must 
go to the securing of them. There are some breaches of order 
that result so surely from the absence of certain necessary con- ” 
ditions, or the existence of other undesirable ones, that we have 
only ourselves to blame when they occur. However interesting a 
lesson may be, it will not be likely to keep the attention of a child 
who is placed so that he can only see the teacher with difficulty. 
He probably has something in his pocket or desk that is even more 
interesting to him, and he will turn his attention to it very philo-” 
sophically. 
Commonsense tells us to place all our pupils where they can 
both see and hear us easily ; and, having done so, to give at least 
an occasional glance to see that they are taking full advantage of 
their position. This brings us to an important part of class 
management,. the arrangement of the class for various kinds of 
lessons. The main points to be remembered in making such ar- 
rangements are that both we and our pupils must be able to see 
and hear all that it is necessary for us to see and hear, and that our 
pupils ‘must besides have space for the position and movements 
and materials required by their work. 
For reading classes many teachers prefer their pupils to stand 
in a circular or three-sided formation, the open side being for the
-P-A-G-E-69
56 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
blackboard. If we adopt this arrangement we must be careful to 
see that at such times as we stand—or sit—still, none of the chil- 
dren at the ends of the two side wings are behind us, for “ out of 
sight ” in class is frequently “into mischief.’ ” Standing, however, 
is rather a trying position for upper standard children, and perhaps 
even for younger ones in this country, though it offers the advan- 
tage of providing a change from, the position necessary for most 
lessons. There should be no difficulty in securing good voice pro- 
duction from a class of children seated, for the body from the waist 
upwards can as easily be held erect when sitting as when standing. 
Little children, however, are probably helped both to keep their 
place and to read better when they are in a position which enables 
their teacher to pass behind them round the class as she reads 
with them. 
In writing lessons the chief necéssity is that the children shall 
have room to sit in correct position, and be able to see easily any- 
thing that they may have to transcribe. During dictation they 
‘should be able both to hear and to see the teacher, and should be 
so far from each other that they are not tempted ta '--* -* * 
neighbour’s work, for we should always try to mak: 
hard. 
For oral lessons children should be grouped in a compact class, 
-but not too closely, for hygienic reasons. Such movement as may 
be necessary on their part. during a lesson should be possible with- 
-out disturbing the whole class. Specimens and other illustrations 
should be well within view, or some suitable arrangement should 
be made for passing them. The teacher should be easily seen and 
heard by every member of the class. Arithmetic lessons belong to 
one or other of the foregoing groups. 
The arrangement of a singing class will generally 
during the progress of a lesson. Part of the tim: 
may need to be grouped for oral instruction, and p: 
to stand for breathing exercises and actual singing. 
may necessitate a further re-arrangement. Positio: 
vary with the nature of the exercises. It must b

Serious breaches of discipline may be brought about by very 
trivial causes. A class may be moving from floor to desk position, 
and a-child who is not looking where he is going may walk into 
something that is out of place—a chair, for instance, or an easel 
and blackboard—in such a way as to stumble or to knock it over. 
Just what happens next it will be hard for anyone to say. Pos- 
sibly a second boy may stumble over the first, hurting himself 
slightly, and vent his annoyance by striking out at somebody else. 
A scene of disorder may result, and we may treat those concerned 
with something less than justice. We may reprove the first boy 
for not attending to what he was doing, and the others for want 
of self-control. Probably there was some impishness in it that we 
shall have to ignore; but the fact remains that if the way had 
been clear, as commonsense tells us it should have been, for the class 
to pass, there would have been no disorder. This is only one 
instance of the need there is for untiring attention to details in our 
class management. The preparation and putting away of materials 
and apparatus, the keeping of things in their places, the regulation 
of light and heat, the seeing to this little thing or that little thing 
that may cause disorder or waste of time if unattended to, these 
are cogs in our wheel of work, and must be kept well oiled if that 
is to run smoothly. 
In the classes of young teachers, increasing disorder frequently 
results from a failure to make the first command sufficiently im- 
pressive, and a consequent failure to secure obedience. It is a 
good plan to give some thought to this matter of the first command 
before encountering a new class. It should be given in a clear, 
firm, deliberate voice, and its treatment by the various members 
of the class must be noted. When they realise that the new 
teacher can see and discriminate they will be more ready to submit 
to him. There is, for children, little satisfaction in behaving well 
in the class of an undiscriminating teacher. 
The secret of stopping disorder is to check it at the outset 
by discovering its cause and removing it. We should insist 
quietly on orderly ways of work and conduct, refraining from com- 
plaint and threat—holding punishment in reserve, unhinted at. 
It is not difficult to create in this way a feeling on the part of the 
class that nothing will be passed over until it is properly done, and, 
where this exists, children quickly yield to authority. 
To turn away from the class without seeing whether obedience

58 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
promptly follows an order is fatal. Yet the mistake is very often 
made by young teachers. They say, “ Pass pens and books,” and 
immediately turn to the cleaning of the blackboard or some 
other such operation. The intention apparently is to save time ; 
but the practice defeats its own aim. When a teacher has trained 
his class in habits of prompt obedience, it is right for him to cease 
from strict surveillance and to go about his business while the 
children go about theirs, as this is a first step between “ govern- 
ment ” and “ discipline.” To begin the practice at the outset, how- 
ever, is to count upon more obedience than most young teachers 
can be sure of. 
Another thing affecting obedience is the nature of the com- 
mand. Commands should be firm and unmistakable, not a 
blending of order, plea and warning which can only make a blurred 
impression on the -children. Decision of mind, of course, is a 
matter of personality ; but it is a characteristic that can be culti- 
vated, and during cultivation the outward signs of it—the fi 
brisk tone and the brief words of command—may be made tc 
duty in its place. To assume a necessary virtue is the best « 
of making it ours. By degrees the lack of decision that causes 
hesitating orders and changes of front will yield to resoluteness of 
mind and will. 
The problem of the management of “ single teacher schools ** 
not remote from that of class management, and should perhap, 
touched upon before we turn to another topic. To teachers in 
charge of a school the school is the class—a class which presents al 
number of problems to be solved by management. Such teachers 
frequently make the mistake of attempting too much in the way o 
standardising, the usual practice being to keep to th 
standards in a fully staffed school—or at least as 1 
seven, with sub-standards besides, as pupils presen 
for. This is not good either for teachers or for pupils 
to teach seven, or even five, divisions puts undue : 
teacher’s powers, and is responsible, moreover, for a 
waste. The energy given to planning how to fit in o1 
another will be more profitably given to the prepara 
teaching. 
The solution of the problem will be found in grouping. It jj 
to be doubted whether any teacher can do justice to a number 
children if the attempt is made to teach them in more than thre|

divisions. A sense of hurry and worry will almost certainly in- 
vade the work, and this will be bad for all concerned. On the 
other hand, if the children are grouped as Infants, Juniors and 
Seniors, those in each division may receive the kind of teaching 
suited to their stage of development, and the covering of set syl- 
labuses of work is a matter of much less importance. Moreover, 
there is no reason why the actual progress of individual children 
in the “standard” requirements should be less, and there is a 
very great likelihood that it will be more by reason of the time 
saved. . . 
So far the suggestions made refer generally to class manage- 
ment of either younger or older children. It remains to suggest 
how “government”? may yield gradually to “ discipline” ; the 
teacher’s control to the self-control of the pupils. 
Young children are, by reason of their undeveloped natures, 
unfitted to govern themselves. The will is weak, and while 
momentary desires are specially keen, the capacity for foresight 
and forethought hardly exists, so that children are apt to act upon 
impulse, regardless of consequences. Their moral natures, like 
their minds and bodies, are undeveloped. It would, therefore, be 
both unwise and unfair to expect them to assume responsibility 
for their own behaviour. Government and supervision are neces- 
sary throughout the lower standards, where definite orders must be 
given and the carrying out of them seen to. A Standard I or II 
class, again, should not be left in a classroom for more than a 
minute or two without a teacher. Yet, as the only way to acquire 
a virtue is to practise it, even young children must be given oppor- 
tunity for self-control. The amount bf the exercise must be 
suited to the weakness of their moral nature ; and that expected 
of young children should be easy and of short duration. 
Jn Standard IIT the periods of self-government may be leng- 
thened ; but inquiry should be made at the end of each, All 
children should be expected to confess their own misdemeanours, 
and tale-bearing should be discouraged. In Standard IV inquiry 
should not be so much a matter of course, but should be made from 
time to time when circumstances seem to demand it. The class is 
as it were a bridge between the lower and higher standards ; and 
in it government should yield to a larger extent to self-control, 
In the upper standards opportunity should be further increased, 
until in Standard VII conduct should be governed less by class
-P-A-G-E-73

rules than by individual respect for the wish of the school autho- 
rities, consideration for the work of the class, regard for the rights 
and privileges of schoolfellows, and personal sense of right and 
wrong. At this stage all that the teacher possesses of tact and 
discernment will be needed to show trust and at the same time 
prevent abuses of it ; for while children become trustworthy by 
being trusted, it is too much to expect that no breaches of trust 
will occur, and much evil may result from these if they go undis- 
covered. 
What can we do to assist the growth of the higher moral quali- 
ties? To begin with, they must have the right atmosphere for 
growth ; for the fruits of the spirit are as dependent on “ climate ” 
as are the fruits of the soil. They then must be nourished; and 
character, like mind, is nourished by ideas. We may supply these 
directly by presenting in fable, story and poem examples of the 
virtues and qualities we wish to see in them. We may also supply 
them indirectly through the subjects of the curriculum, every 
lesson that we give from first to last tending in some measure to 
realise this aim of education. Thirdly, we must provide oppor- 
tunity for the exercise of desired virtues that they may be streng- 
thened in action. But one thing is certain. If we have not our- 
selves the feeling that it is lovely and to be desired, if we have not 
striven with some measure of success to make it our own, we 
cannot make any virtue theirs. Herein we differ from the gardener, 
to whose work our own is often likened : we must have in ourselves 
the qualities we try to cultivate. : 
Child-study has made the question of means of punishment in 
schools much less acute, for it has shown that children * 
greater interest than in learning if they are taught suitabl 
in the right way. It has been proved beyond all doubt thi 
this condition exists, there is no need to “ drive ” children ' 
or to. hold punishments over their heads in order to get th. 
work out of them. Happy at their school tasks, they — 
always on the look-out for mischief, or very frequently guilty of 
acts of insubordination. Yet, because teachers are at times con. 
fronted with the necessity for punishing, the inexperienced - 
some guidance in a matter which presents serious problems 
solution. . 
In considering the treatment called for by wrong-doing or 
part of our pupils, it is necessary for us to try to look on the
-P-A-G-E-74

ge 
NE 
OT 
ET 
SI The Student as Teacher 61 
of children from their standpoint, to try to see each act as it 
appeared to the child at or before the moment of committal. Having 
little experience, children do not always foresee the evil conse- 
quences of an action, and we must not judge their misdemeanours 
as if they did. It is possible, however, that some dangerous prac- 
tice indulged in has been forbidden. Here, then, is a fault of 
disobedience ; and as obedience may be expected of children even 
before school age, a suitable punishment has no element of injustice 
in it. Incidentally, it may be said here that, as a rule, a practice 
should not be forbidden until an inclination towards it has been 
shown. We should not “ suggest ” wrong-doing. 
A word or two is necessary as to the form punishments should 
take. The use of one form of it—corporal punishment—is wisely 
forbidden to young teachers, as much in their own interests as in 
the children’s. There are better ways of governing children than 
by caning ; but caning is apt to present itself as easier, and if it 
were allowed to young teachers, it is possible that they would 
never discover the better ways. Their powers of management 
would remain undeveloped, their characters would suffer, and the 
happiest relations between themselves and their pupils would not 
be likely to be attained. The case is different when, after having 
proved themselves efficient in control without it, they decide in the 
case of some individual child that corporal punishment is the most 
appropriate form. For the children’s sake, also, the prohibiting 
of corporal punishment is advisable. Young teachers are without 
experience in fitting the punishment either to the fault or to what 
the offender is able to bear without injury ; for corporal punish- 
ment should be infrequent and severe—severe, in order that it 
may be infrequent. If it is too severe or too light, serious harm 
is done. 
Other usual forms of punishment are detentions, impositions, 
and the withdrawal of privileges. The first must be governed to 
a large extent by the hours of the school sessions. If children, as 
is sometimes-the case in South Africa, have been at lessons from 
half-past eight to half-past one, with only a short interval, it is 
obviously not right to detain them for punishment except in the 
most extreme cases of insubordination. Very frequently, too, the 
long distances between school and home, or weather conditions, 
make it almost impossible to bring them back to do neglected 
work later in the afternoon, though this suggests itself as the best
-P-A-G-E-75
62 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
time. Home impositions are another unsatisfactory form . of 
punishment, as children frequently succeed in evading them. 
Further, when pages of geography, history or verses of poetry are 
set to be learnt as impositions, a dislike of the subject, which it 
was no part of our intention to cause, is the main effect of 
such punishment. The withdrawal of privileges is probably the 
most satisfactory form of punishment devisable, and it is import- 
ant that school work should be regarded as the chief of these privi- 
leges. If a child causes disorder and disturbance in class, it is 
more fitting to dismiss him from the lesson than to give him a task 
in connection with it ; but, of course, a teacher who dismisses a 
child from class must make the dismissal felt so much that it acts 
as a deterrent both on the offender and on the other children. 
In the case of self-governed children the deprivation of their 
privilege of special exemption from rules is generally felt so much 
that they rarely repeat an offence. Where a fault is repeated, the 
offender should be. brought back—publicly or not, as the circum- 
stances demand—into the ranks of those to whom the privilege of 
self-government has not been accorded, and should be regarded as 
one of them till such time as he has won it back again. As a rule 
this punishment is enough for an older pupil. 
The inquiry into a misdemeanour must be pursued without 
vindictiveness—good-humouredly, indeed—and will then in no 
wise injure the relations between teacher and pupils, the latter 
being quite ready to allow the teacher’s rights in the matter. 
The question of rewards also calls for consideration, Where 
school-work is regarded as a privilege and pleasure in itself, the 
need for rewards as an encouragement of application to that work 
seems to disappear with the need for punishment. Consequently, 
teachers’ ideas of prizes are undergoing revision. It is realised 
that they tend to create ill-will in some natures, and heartsoreness 
in others, and to weaken the feeling that the work and successful 
attainment are rewards in themselves. Moreover, injustice is often 
done, the prizes going not to the children who have been most con- 
scientious and done the best with reference to their powers, but to 
* those who, through favouring circumstances for which they de- 
serve no credit, have taken higher places. It is doubtful, too, 
whether the parade connected with public prize-giving has an 
altogether desirable effect on the natures of the prize-winners. 
There is one reward, however, which one would like to see
-P-A-G-E-76

am The Student as Teacher 63 
given to every child who by diligence and effort in class work 
has won a place and power that seemed out of reach, or by interest 
in or natural aptitude for some subject has reached a point at which 
it seems to open before him with new meaning—the reward of 
being able to go on. It may be given in the form of some equip- 
ment, book, or bursary which makes going on possible ; but it is 
not necessary that it should take a material form at all, It might 
be the reward of further instruction which the teacher has found 
means of giving—not perhaps personally—and there need be no 
public ceremony of award. Another good form of reward is that 
given to a whole class in the form, say, of a picture, of reference 
books, or of some equipment necessary for the continued study of 
a subject in which the class has shown special interest. Such 
rewards engender no bitterness of heart in individuals, and tend 
to foster that esprit de corps, the exercise of which is the child’s 
first training in considering other interests than his own. 
There is a duty of teachers closely concerned with this matter 
of rewards and punishments—the duty of seeking in their work 
the co-operation of parents. ‘The interests of parents and teachers 
are so much the same in all that affects the children, that results 
desired by both are more likely to be attained when they work 
together. In the past, it is true, the feeling that school lessons 
and home life were in some measure antagonistic has been not un- 
reasonably held on both sides ; but present-day efforts to bridge 
the gulf between the two should soon succeed in establishing 
happier relations. The school has everything to gain and nothing 
to lose from an increased interest in its work on the part of parents. 
Often a need for punishment can be avoided by a visit to a child’s 
home, which reveals causes that when known are seen to be re- 
movable, or to form, perhaps, an argument in favour of patience. 
Often, again, if the interest of parents in better circumstances is 
gained, it may lead to the relief of suffering among poorer children. 
Nor should the visiting be all on one side. Parents should feel 
that they will be welcome at the school, though in the interests 
of the children’s work it may be necessary to ask that their visits 
be made at set times. On these occasions some informal singing 
and reciting, and the exhibition of some of the children’s work, 
will have the effect of increasing home interest in school tasks, 
and so bringing the two sides of the children’s lives into closer 
relation,

‘We come now to the matter of teaching. How are we to learn 
to master the art which we have chosen as our lifework? To begin 
with, we must get away from the notion that teaching is concerned 
with the giving of lessons only and try to make our work what it 
should be—the daily development of the life and nature of children. 
What needs to be emphasized is the connection that must exist 
between one lesson and another, the continuity that there must be 
in all teaching. School time-tables, it is true, are marked for half- 
hour periods, the time of a single lesson ; but this is for reasons 
which we can all appreciate. The subject-matter of teaching has 
to be divided in such a way that neither the bodies or the minds 
of children grow tired for want of change—~of position or of occupa- 
tion—and to allow opportunity for food, exercise and rest. Study 
of the mind has shown that its power of attending without a break 
to one kind of work is strictly limited. In the case of infants it 
lasts only a quarter of an hour, increasing gradually until in the 
upper standards thirty-five to forty-five minutes is found not to 
cause undue strain. A fair average time for middle standards is 
the thirty minutes familiar as the length of a lesson. But though 
this division of our work is absolutely essential, it should be regarded 
as what it is—simply a convenient way of meeting the needs of 
mind and body, and not as forming a barrier between one piece of 
teaching and the next. ° 
The necessity of preparing notes of lessons for inspection has, 
perhaps, done more than anything else to place undue emphasis 
on single, separate lessons. Vet the writing of notes of lessons by 
teachers in training is essential. Written preparation of lessons 
before they are given may or may not be advisable in ordinary school 
practice. When there are eight or ten lessons to be given in the 
course of a day, the writing of even short notes of them takes more 
time than a teacher may be able to give. If he can satisfy himself 
that he has the matter for any of them clearly arranged in his mind, 
he will be well advised to save the time he would need to give to 
writing notes for these in order that he may concentrate attention 
on other lessons about which he feels less sure. But student- 
teachers are in a different case. For one thing, however well they 
may know the subject-matter of a lesson as students, they are 
unlikely, until they have had a good deal of practice, to be ** 
make the best of it as teachers. The early lessons of eve 
students suffer very generally from want of form, and writir

.out beforehand helps to bring their ideas, and therefore the presenta- 
tion of them, into shape. Another reason why notes of lessons are 
required of teachers in training is that they have to satisfy not 
themselves but their instructors and examiners of their ability to 
teach any lesson they may be called upon to give. It is impossible 
-to judge of this in the absence of written notes unless a complete 
lesson is heard, and this cannot be done over the whole range of 
subjects professed. Full notes have therefore, necessarily, to be 
submitted ; but these of late years have come to take too large a 
space in our thoughts. It seems sometimes as if we felt the “ Notes ” 
to be more important than the lesson ; and we are apt, as has been 
said, to look on teaching as the giving of a succession of single 
lessons, losing thereby the sense of that continuity of purpose and 
training through which alone natures are developed and lives in- 
fluenced. We have passed, in fact—or are in danger of passing— 
from formlessness to formalism, and we need now to find the happy 
mean between these two extremes. 
One reason why notes of lessons and the lessons themselves tend 
to be formal is that the question of form is too much in the minds 
of student-teachers at the time of writing them. . This should not 
be the case. Form should be studied during composition lessons, 
and practised every time a written abstract is made of any matter 
set for study. A good clear style of statement would then be 
habitual ; and this would allow the mind during the writing of 
“Notes” to be given almost wholly to what is more important 
than the form of them—their purpose and the best means of attain- 
ing it. : 
Apart from examination purposes, which should never be the 
first consideration in our minds, the writing of notes of lessons is 
meant to give an opportunity for selection and arrangement of 
matter enabling us to choose from our whole knowledge of the sub- 
ject just what will make the most effective lesson for the particular 
class of children to be taught, and to decide upon the best form of 
presentation and illustration. . 
This brings us to the lesson itself. How are we to teach it ? 
The answer, whatever the subject to be taught, is the same: “ As 
the children can learn it.” We need, then, to discover how children 
learn, | 5 - 
In the éffort.to do so we may turn back to what was said of the 
stages of growth in Chapter I. The most obvious physical change in 
E
-P-A-G-E-79
66 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
children from infancy to boyhood or girlhood is their increase in size. 
Less physiological knowledge than is necessary for young teachers 
willexplainthisincrease. Duringlife there are going on continuously 
in the body two opposite processes—a wearing down and a building 
up. The wearing down begins with the first breath drawn. It is 
the waste of bodily substance due to the using of physical energy. 
The building up is brought about by eating and digesting food. 
If these two processes balanced each other there could be no change 
of size in the human body ; but this, we know, is not the case except 
during a few years in middle life. In youth the building up of the 
body is in excess of the waste going on, and young people conse- 
quently grow, as we say. With the approach of old age the amount 
of waste exceeds what it is within the failing powers of the body to 
repair, and it therefore, as a rule, lessens appreciably in size and 
weight. 
While we must not push the comparison too far, for oneis matter 
and the other is not, there is a similarity between the growth of the 
body and the growth of the mind. The mind, like the body, is de- 
pendent for its health and growth on food and exercise taken under 
right conditions. Ideas form the food and the means of exercise 
of the mind. Among the right conditions we may mention suita- 
bility of food and the alternation of exercise and rest. As in the 
case of the body, food suitable at one age is unsuitable at another. 
A wise mother will give her children much milk and little meat— 
will allow them sweets, but will keep pickles from them; and a 
wise teacher will not furnish abstract ideas as mind-food for young 
pupils. Our glance at the changing interests of children and at 
the things they are most easily able to do as they pass from age to 
age has given us some notion of what forms suitable mind-food for 
them in the various stages of growth. 
The question now arises : “ By what means and in what manner 
does the mind take in and absorb its food?” In the case of the 
body the natural stimulus of the building-up process is hunger. Tha 
the mind feels a like stimulus we cannot doubt, and more particu. 
larly in youth, its period of greatest growth. It has been well sai 
that the attitude of the child-mind towards life can be expressed b: 
the one word Hunger. It is hungry to be, hungry to do, hungry t¢ 
find out and to know. The:mind then, stimulated by one or othe 
of these hungers, stretches out towards action and knowledge 
and from these it builds up its substance and strength from day t

day. Civilised man, however, has learned to anticipate his hunger 
both of body and mind—in the one case by regular meals, in the 
other by regular lessons. Regarded in this light, our work of teach- 
ing reveals itself as being the preparation and serving of food for 
the child mind—food which must be, to continue our physical 
comparison, at the same time palatable (appealing to taste) and 
digestible (resulting in nourishment). 
Now, just as the only food which can become part of our bodily 
substance is that which contains some of the elements which com- 
pose the body, so the ideas which form mental food can only be 
taken in by the mind if they are of the same sort as, or have some- 
thing to do with, ideas which—previously taken in—have built up 
that mind. 
Our minds begin to gather ideas as soon as we begin to feel 
and see and smell—in other words, as soon as we begin to use 
our senses. Each new idea has to gain its entrance through 
the influence of some previously admitted idea, being, as Professor 
Adams puts it, in the same position as a person who seeks entrance 
to some club or society through the good offices of a friend 
already a member of it. If we pursue for a moment this figure 
of a club member, we can see what his course of action will 
be on gaining entry to the club: he will “associate” at first 
chiefly with his friend ; but as time goes on will form connections 
with other members of tastes similar to his own, whether these 
entered the club before or after him. In the same way an idea gain- 
ing entry to the circle of ideas forming a mind makes associations 
first with the introducing idea or ideas, and then with other ideas 
of a like nature. This way in which new ideas find lodgment in 
minds through similar ideas already present is known as Appercep- 
tion, and a group of associated ideas as an Apperception Mass ; but 
the remembering of the names is very much less important than 
the accepting of the theory as a guide in teaching. We owe the 
theory to a German mind-student and educationist named Herbart, 
and the word Herbartianism, with which we frequently meet in 
educational writings, is used to express the sum of his teaching. 
Although the mind is unable to take in any totally foreign or 
unrelated idea, there is a constant effort on its part—at least where 
interest is aroused—to form an association between newly presented 
ideas and those stored within it. This fact is made clear by the 
habit little children have of naming some new object from its re-
-P-A-G-E-81

semblance to some other that is familiar. “Thus an orange, seen 
for the first time, is called a ball, and a child who has a pet cat 
will fondle a fur muff and call it “kitty.” A little book written 
on the subject of “ Apperception ” gives a further illustration in 
its title: A Pot of Green Feathers—a child’s exclamation on first 
seeing afern, © 
Since the ideas we present in teaching can only enter our pupils’ 
minds through association with some one or more of the ideas 
which have entered previously, we must always ask ourselves, when 
thinking out a lesson to be given, what the children are likely to 
know about the subject of it before we begin to teach. If we can 
answer the question we know our starting-point ; if we can not, we 
must give the first minute or two of our teaching to firiding out, 
Let us take a few examples. : . 
Under ordinary class-teaching conditions most of our lessons 
follow some other on the same subject. In these circumstances 
our best opening is by brief questioning on that part of a previous 
lesson which will bring into- activity the ideas associated with the 
subject-matter of the new one, Let us suppose that the lesson is 
on addition of money, and that the class is Standard INI. Their 
having passéd out of Standard II is a guarantee that the pupils 
know the simple rules, Probably division was the last of these 
taught to them ; but we should not, of course, try to connect com- 
pound addition with that, but with simple addition that was taught 
earlier ; and, when the necessity comes for turning pence into 
shillings, we shall associate the operation with that of turning units 
into tens. The fact that in the one case it takes ten of the smaller 
to make one of the larger,and in the other twelve, will give no trouble 
if the children are reminded of it in the first few exercises. This 
example has. been taken as showing that, in class teaching, it is 
sometimes necessary to go back to a much earlier lesson in order 
to find the true connection with the new one to be taught. What 
is necessary in such cases is to summon in review previous lessons 
in the same subject and to see what old knowledge can be made 
most serviceable in forming associations with the new. 
Sometimes, however, we have to introduce our class to a new 
subject. On first thoughts it might seem that children who have 
never had a history lesson cannot have any ideas on the subject: 
But almost all children have heard stories from history and have 
gathered ideas from these ; better still, their own experience has

furnished them. History is at their doors ; within them, indeed. 
The white faces, the black and the brown—how is the presence of 
different races in the country to be accounted for ? Are any native ? 
When and how and why did the others come to it ? South African 
history from a European standpoint begins with these last ques- 
tions, and the children are ready for their first lesson on it: “ How 
the White Man came.” New subjects, indeed, are never wholly 
new. 
The new class is a greater difficulty—a difficulty that is met with 
at the beginning of the school-year and upon change of schools. 
But even with a new class we have, to help us, our knowledge of the 
facts that are broadly true of all children at the same stage of 
growth. Until childhood is over, the differences are not so great as 
the resemblances. As regards their school work it is necessary to 
consult, if possible, the previous teacher of the class ; failing that, 
to study the class syllabus and record. . It is advisable also to allow 
some time—say, a week—for learning something about the children 
before beginning the formal programme of work. After this, we 
should be able to find the right opening for any lesson that has to 
be given. 
Where the children are strange to the teacher, and the subject 
is unfamiliar to’ the class, the first thing to be done is to recall the 
broad facts true of children of the age of those to be taught, and to 
be guided by these in the search for their interests which, in turn, 
will show where preparatory ideas are to be found. 
Let us suppose, for example, that we are required to give, on 
examination day or in the practising school, a first grammar lesson 
to a Standard III class that we have not taught before. It has 
already been pointed out that grammar lessons for young chil- 
dren should concern themselves with actual speech. But where 
are we to begin ? Surely, in the case of a new subject, at the 
beginning. And where must we go for the beginnings of speech ? 
To babyland, of course. Are the children in the class likely to have 
had any chance of hearing a baby trying to talk? Without doubt 
most of them will have had this chance. They have, then, suffi- 
cient knowledge for our purpose ; there are, that is to say, in their 
minds ideas related to those we wish to present. They have 
heard some baby learning to speak, and can tell us in answer to 
our questions that he begins by making unintelligible sounds which 
gradually increase in number and variety. and at last form recog-.
-P-A-G-E-83
70 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
nisable words. Further, some of them can tell us the first word 
that the baby in their house was heard to say. If we write these 
words—“ dadda,” “mamma,” “babba,” etc—on the board as 
they are given, the children may be led to see that the first words of 
a baby’s speech are names, But soon, they will tell us, the baby 
learns to use others—“ give,” “‘ kiss,” “want,” etc. These are not 
name-words, as the children will readily see on examining them. By 
means of these the baby tells those around him what he wishes them 
to do. Later, he advances from saying single words to putting 
a whole thought into speech, as, for-example, “ Baby wants dolly.” 
During such preparatory questioning our pupils will have been 
led to bring into the focus of their minds from below the threshold 
of consciousness old knowledge which will “open” them, we may 
say, to the new ideas we wish to present: the grammatical truths 
that there are different kinds of words which have different work to 
do in speech; that the two chief kinds, their importance being 
proved by the fact that they are learnt first, are distinguished as 
name-words (nouns) and action-words (verbs); that name-words 
and action-words are put together in speech in a way that expresses 
a whole thought ; that such an arrangement of words is called a 
sentence ; that every sentence has two parts ; and that these may 
be called, after the chief words in them, the name-part and the 
action-part. . 
Ideas of this introductory type,which’will prepare the’minds of 
the pupils for the new ideas to be presented are always to be found 
if we know where to look for them : 
“No part of human knowledge or experience is™without rela- 
tions to every other part. One mark of a well-trained mind is just 
this, that the proper connections have been formed between the 
various classes of ideas which make up its furnishing. .. . The 
uneducated man may have two ideas which are really closely re- 
lated to each other, but he may fail entirely to see their connection. 
The skilful teacher is always able to introduce the unknown by 
means of something partly known, even with her youngest pupils, 
and it is with the youngest that the difficulty of doing so is greatest. 
As the circle of the pupils’ ideas enlarges, the available points of 
relation increase with great rapidity, and the difficulty of knowing 
where to begin becomes less and less. Hence one reason why the 
youngest pupils should always be under the most skilled teacher.
-P-A-G-E-84
The Student as Teacher - 71 
The fewer ideas the mind contains, the fewer will it receive by its 
own unaided action from among the indefinite number which are 
offered by the subject of study. The fuller the mind is of ideas, 
the richer in new ideas does it find the world of things and of men, 
and the less need it has of the teacher’s guidance” (J. Gunn, The 
Infant School, p. 83). 
When once the necessary association of ideas has been made, 
the giving of the lesson is no longer affected to the same extent by 
varying conditions with regard to the subject and the class, 
Having brought the mind into a state favourable to the accept- 
ance of the new ideas we desire to present, we must next proceed to 
present them with all the skill we can. During this presentation 
of ideas we must beware of introducing such as are alien to the pur- 
pose of the lesson. In preparing pupils for their first grammar 
lesson, for instance, as suggested above, we must not allow ourselves 
or the children to be drawn by the fascinations of the babies, whose 
aid we have invoked, away from the subject of grammar, and begin 
to talk of other things they do. “ Wandering by the way ” is one 
of the chief causes of unfinished lessons and of their failure to 
fulfil their aim. Such distracting ideas must be rigidly withstood, 
only such new ones being presented or encouraged as further the 
teaching in progress or pave the way for the next lesson of our 
prepared scheme. 
In presenting ideas to a class it is necessary to be very clear. 
Clearness is a result, in part, of a wise selection of ideas ; but it is 
also partly due to the order of their presentation. Want of arrange- 
ment is very common in the lessons of unskilful teachers, but-may 
be made to disappear under training—a self-training that consists 
in the careful preparation of all subject-matter to be taught. Thus, 
in choosing his ideas for a lesson, the teacher must ask himself 
“ Which is it necessary to present first ? Which are the conclud- 
ing ideas? How can I arrange the intervening part so that the 
thread of my teaching passes straight from point to point and is 
not lost in a maze of words and ideas ?” 
To this second division of the lesson belongs whatever illustra- 
tion we deem necessary. The purpose of illustration in teaching, as 
the derivation of the word (from Latin illustrare, to light up) may 
help to remind us, is to make clear our meaning to the minds of our 
pupils. Although objects, specimens or other apparatus, and draw-
-P-A-G-E-85
72 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
ings—pictures, sketches or diagrams—are very valuable means of 
illustration, it is not to be thought that they form the only possible 
ones. Illustration is possible by word as well as by substance and 
line. A homely simile, a reference to some familiar experience, the 
recall of some piece of previous knowledge, may all be made to 
serve as useful illustration ; and we should be ready with these no 
less than with those mentioned above. We must provide objects 
and specimens when these are the best means of illustration, and 
when they are available without creating more disturbance and 
discomfort than is justified by their value. But we should remem- 
ber that apparatus, except in the case of advanced experiments 
not common in the elementary school, is no more effective for being 
elaborate and expensive. We must learn to use for purposes of 
illustration the material which is to be found at hand in common 
things and familiar doings in nature, and in the school and home. 
In drawing for illustration we must beware of unnecessary detail 
and elaboration. Any drawing which takes more than a minute or 
two to put on the board is out of place in a half-hour lesson. Nor 
is any useful purpose served by sketching what is so familiar that a 
few words would serve to call up an image of it. Illustrative draw- 
ing in teaching should have the one aim of shedding light on what 
is dark in the teacher’s meaning. Rightly used, there is no better 
means, for by it meaning can be made quite unmistakable ; and 
the more readily a teacher is able to draw, the more successful his 
teaching is likely to be. 
In the two preceding divisions of lessons the work is done mainly 
though it should not be done entirely—by the teacher. In the 
first place he makes it possible for the children to receive the new 
ideas to be presented ; and in the second he presents the ideas in 
the manner and order necessary for clear understanding, 
this easier by the use of suitable illustration. In these parts of the 
lesson, ideas are used mainly as food for the mind ; in the following 
ones, they serve chiefly their other use as its means of exercise. To 
go back to our physical comparison, we know quite well what would 
be the effect of serving a second meal before an earlier one had been 
assimilated. It is quite certain that mental indigestion exists to an 
alarming extent among school children, and forms one of the main 
reasons why their minds benefit so much less than they should do 
from the class-teaching they receive. They are given one lesson 
after another in which, while ideas are furnished by the teacher,
-P-A-G-E-86
The Student as Teacher 73 
there is no provision for the assimilation of them by the children. 
We are familiar enough with the necessity for exercise to aid diges- 
tion—or assimilation—in the case of the body, but are apt to 
overlook it in the case of the mind. Of course, this is not true to 
the same extent in all subjects. In reading, writing and arith- 
metic the tendency is the other way. In these subjects the pupils 
are frequently required to exercise overmuch on very few ideas— 
the result being to render their work mechanical—but in the higher 
subjects the exercise provided is very frequently insufficient. 
The first way in which the mind exercises itself upon the newly 
presented ideas is by finding a place for them among the ideas with 
which earlier knowledge and experience have furnished it. Con- 
versation between us and our pupils is what is needed at this point ; 
and we should stimulate this by such questions as will set them 
comparing and contrasting their newly-gained ideas with their 
earlier ones, for it is on resemblances and differences that associa- 
tions are based. If we give the children time to think, and help them 
with an occasional hint, they will find for themselves companion 
ideas and helpful illustrations in a way that will surprise us. 
When all the ideas that bear on the subject have been associated 
(compared, contrasted and arranged), another step must be taken—- 
that of stating the discoveries made or the conclusions come to, 
in a way that gathers up the new knowledge gained and expresses 
it in a form easy to remember. With a little help and encourage- 
ment, again, the children will be able to make some statement 
of the main teaching they have received. At any rate, it will be 
good for them to try. Their minds will be more active than if 
they were only required to read or repeat a statement written or 
spoken by the teacher. Such statements should always be very 
simple ; for the stilted language of formal rules and definitions has 
little meaning for children, and the best they can do with it is to 
memorise it mechanically. Their own language is far more likely 
to convey ideas to them, and, with such corrections as may be 
necessary, should be accepted. This systematised statement of 
knowledge gained completes the fourth division of lessons. As it 
forms a summary of the lesson, it may be used for the purpose of 
recapitulation, the teacher briefly running through it and so re- 
calling the chief heads of the lesson before examining. It is 
important that ‘no new ideas be introduced at this stage. 
We come now to the final division of our teaching. This is the
-P-A-G-E-87
74 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
stage at which exercises should be set to prove whether it has been 
effective. It corresponds to the using of ideas gained in study. If 
the exercises are suitable and the pupils are able to respond to the 
demands made by them, the ideas—previously conveyed, connected 
and systematised—may be regarded as assimilated. They have 
become part of the mind, as material food, when digestion is com- 
pleted, becomes part of the body, and so may be used in future 
work. 
While this application of ideas is just as true a part of any 
lesson given as the other divisions of it, it is possible—though not 
advisable, except in cases of necessity—to reserve it for a subse- 
quent one. It may, for instance, take us the whole of thirty 
minutes to explain the piinciple of subtraction to a dull class. 
We should then, naturally—after, perhaps, a brief revision— 
devote our next lesson in arithmetic to exercises on the rule ; and 
these exercises would be the application of our previous lesson. 
The nature of the exercises given to test knowledge will, of 
But the meaning of the word do in this application must not be 
narrowed. We may often be content if we succeed in making our 
pupils think for themselves about what they have been learning, 
and see how and where they may apply it to their work and conduct. 
The subject of class teaching cannot be left without reference 
to the matter of questioning, which enters so largely into it. In 
the first place it is necessary to distinguish between the two pur- 
poses of questioning—teaching and testing. Questions which are 
used for the former purpose must be something more than a mere 
interrogation. Regarding the lesson as a line of thought to be 
followed out to some desired conclusion, we may say that each 
teaching question must carry the reasoning a step forward. The 
final shaping of such questions, though they must necessarily be 
considered in preparation, should be determined during the course 
of the lesson ; for they must grow out of the pupils’ answers. Test- 
ing questions may be put to several uses—to testing knowledge at 
the beginning of a lesson in order to discover the starting-point 
or, during the lesson, to see whether the pupils have grasped th 
presented ideas ; or, at the close, to show whether the teaching ha. 
been effective. They are useful also in checking inattention. course, differ with that of the lesson. Their purpose is to get pupils 
to prove that they know by showing that they are able to do such 
tasks as the lesson, rightly learned, should have fitted them for.

TA OI, The Student as Teacher 75 
In order that their meaning may be understood, questions must. 
be clearly worded, and, for the same reason, should not contain 
words unfamiliar to the children, whose vocabularies, it must be 
remembered, are extremely limited. The questioner must have a 
definite idea of what he wishes to ask, and of his purpose in asking ; 
and the words which he uses must have an equally definite meaning 
—and the same meaning—for his class. Questions should also be 
as concise as possible, so that the pupils may be in no doubt as to 
what is wanted of them. Furthermore, they should be reasonable, 
not assuming on the part of the children knowledge and powers, 
they cannot be expected to possess. The form of questions should 
be decided upon before the first word of them is spoken. Only con- 
fusion can result in children’s minds from a. question which is begun 
in one form, is felt to be unsatisfactory, and after a break and some 
stammering, takes on another form in the middle, resolving itself 
into quite a different question before the end. When this sort of 
questioning is not due to nervousness, it is due to insufficient pre- 
paration, or to slovenly habits of thought and speech. In any case 
the cure is in the teacher’s own hands, for it lies in self-training. 
Questions should be in the interrogative form throughout—not 
beginning in the affirmative, as, for example, “ Johannesburg is 
noted for what ? ’—a clumsy construction that should be avoided. 
Lastly—a necessary injunctior in a bilingual country—they should. 
be expressed in correct idiom of the language used. “This is a 
bean—not so ? ” is not English, and should not, therefore, be heard 
in a lesson given in that language. Finally, questions should not 
be repeated ; and, as a rule, neither should answers. 
The skilled questioner is shown also in his treatment of answers. 
The requiring of complete sentences in answer to all questions has 
been overdone of late years. To expect a child to say in answer 
to the question: “ At what time did the sun set yesterday ?” “ The 
sun set at six o’clock yesterday ” is to encourage waste of time and 
stilted speech, In questioning it is not complete sentences, but 
complete answers that are wanted. At the same time, children 
are, unless constant care is taken, very apt to answer in mono- 
syllables. They jerk out a single word, and seem to expect theteacher 
to be satisfied, though it but vaguely suggests the required answer. 
No such incomplete answers should be accepted. They are offences 
not only against good language, but also against good manners. 
Other answers which must be rejected are those which show culp-
-P-A-G-E-89
76 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
able carelessness or mere guesswork. A restatement of | 
matical answers must always be required ; but very tactfully, and { 
in such a way that the train of thought is not broken. Answers 
wrong in substance also need correction—by the child himself if 
possible ; failing that, by.other members of the class ; in the end, 
ifnecessary, by the teacher. The cause of the error must, if possible, 
be shown. It is, however, in the use of answers that are partly 
wrong and partly right that the good teacher is shown. To lead 
a child to truth through his own error is the feat of a skilled ques- { 
tioner. : : 
Those of us who find it hard to question well should revise the 
rules during preparation of lessons, and it will be helpful to draw 
up a number of questions in order, though we must not expect to be 
able always to ask them, since the exact course of the lesson will not, 
or should not, be decided by ourselves alone but, in part, by the 
children’s share in it. At the end of a lesson, too, we shall find it 
helpful to recall our questions as well as we can for the purpose of 
criticism, We should not be occupied with the matter while we 
are giving a lesson, for then our thoughts should be fixed on the 
lesson and its effect on the minds of our pupils, and our question- 
ing left to take care of itself. It-will be our general habit of speech, 
therefore, that will decide matters for us ; for, “ one questions as 
one talks. {Good questioning like good exposition is the outcome 
of habits of clear thought and precise expression.: And precise ex- 
pression can only be successfully attained if it is cultivated in speech 
generally, and not merely in interrogation in school” (Welton, 
Principles and Methods of Teaching, p. 92). Once more, we find 
that the cultivation of the power of speech is intimately bound up 
with our success as teachers. 
The principles and methods of class teaching and management 
are here put forward broadly rather than in detail, for it is felt that 
the real strength of teachers comes of their working out their own 
problems once they have mastered the broad principles involved. 
It only remains to emphasize the truth that far beyond the power 
of the best rules ever framed is that of the spirit in which we take 
up the work, the purpose which animates us.. The desire for their] 
good and happiness should be inseparable from our thoughts o 
children. Happiness is their birthright, and it should be our aim t 
restore it to them where they have been robbed of it, and elsewher: 
“to make the happy happier by adding sunshine to daylight.”

whole world as it emerges from the nursery has already gained without con- 
scious labour the best material. . . . No nation can be considered, therefore, 
to have made a beginning of true educational system which does not use the

—Sara C. BRYANT. 
Wuew little children first come to school they show, as a rule, 
extreme poverty both of language and of ideas, and our first efforts | 
must be-directed to supplying their wants in these two particulars. 
The first subject of school instruction, then, is speech—the language 
spoken in the home-~and early lessons should result in our pupils’ 
gaining new ideas and new words for their expression. Informal 
talks will be the best means of furnishing both, though ordinary | 
school intercourse must be made to help. Our aim sho.”” ” 
get the children to talk freely, putting their childish thor 
childlike speech, whilst day by day we try to give them 
grasp of ideas and to get from them a more exact use | 
The work is of first importance. It affects not only the 
the children’s later schoo!-work, but also their success a1: 
ness in after-school years. Without ideas and the words { 
them they would find it hard to advance in learning, in b 
in friendship. , 
In the early stage of language work, it will be valuable to co: 
sider how children below school age gain the power of speech ; £ 
at home they learn naturally. Their first efforts, as we have see 
are in the direction of naming things. Professor Sully in an int 
esting chapter of his book, Children’s Ways, gives some particul, 
7
-P-A-G-E-92
The Cultivation of Speech 19 
of the development of speech. He shows how, having but few 
names at first, ‘‘ the little experimenters make the most of these by 
extending them in new and surprising directions.” Thus “ when 
one child first saw a star andwanted toname it he called it an ‘eye.’” 
For a time their name-words do double duty, mamma and baby 
being used, for example, to cover contrasts of size, as in “ a mother 
shell ” and “a baby shell.” But not only do they stretch the mean- 
ing of words, they also make new and ingenious compounds, One 
child knowing the word “ steam-ship ” and wanting the name sail- 
ing-ship, cleverly hit upon “wind-ship.” From naming things - 
they pass to naming actions. Amusing examples of their word- 
building powers at this stage are seen in “ unhotted” and “‘ un- 
parcelled.” At last they begin to put words together in sentences, 
a great advance on their earlier habit of making known their 
thoughts and wishes by single words. 
The cultivation of speech in the classroom, then, should follow 
the manner of its development in the home. The fact that children 
learn naming-words first, then doing-words, and finally learn .to 
combine the two in sentences, will teach us to take various common 
things as subjects in our earliest language lessons, and the reflec- 
tion that children learn to speak first and most readily about the 
things that they see, will determine that each object—or a repre- 
sentation—shall be actually before them during the talk about it. 
The talk will then pass from what it, or any part of it, is, to what it 
does—or what is done to it~and oral sentence-building will take 
place on natural lines. . 
In South Africa, as in other bilingual countries, a special diffi- 
culty is encountered in language-teaching. In addition to the home 
language the child has to learn, or finds it desirable to learn, a second 
language. When he goes to school, his knowledge of this second 
language is slight ; he may even not know a single word of it, and 
has to begin learning it as a foreign language. The procedure to 
be followed in this case is clear enough. We must take the 
child through those stages in the use of the second language which 
in the case of his mother-tongue have already been passed through 
in the home. As instruction in the second language has thus to 
begin a stage farther back than that in the mother-tongue, it may 
be as well to deal first with the method to be followed in this pre- 
liminary stage of teaching the second language. The wisest plan 
will be to use the “ direct” method of language teaching, which
-P-A-G-E-93
80 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
has of late years proved so successful in the teaching o! | 
languages both to children and to adults.

instruction ; and when, after naming the figure, we tell the cla 
to “Say man,” the example of those who understand will secure t1 
compliance of those who do not. _ Should it happen that no child : 
the class understood, we should need to give the word of commar

which a great deal can be accomplished. Then, pointing to the par

pointed to for “ their.” Objects may be shown for teaching the 
use of “its.” A second five minutes should suffice for this pro- 
noun work. In the third stage short sentences, their meaning 
shown by look and gestures, should be used. Again, if needful, 
the example of children with some knowledge of the language should 
be brought to aid those who have none. As knowledge of the 
meaning of “ one” and “two” will be useful in this stage; these 
numerals should be taught by showing and saying at the same time: 
“ One arm—two arms” ; “ one hand—two hands ” ; “ one finger— 
two fingers” ; “ one foot—-two feet.” After this, we may say with 
appropriate action: “ This is my head. I nod my head—I shake 
my head.” “This is my face. . I hide my face—I show my face.” 
“ These are my eyes. I close my eyes—I open my eyes.” “These 
are my arms. I lift my arms—I drop my arms.” “These are my 
hands. Iraise one hand—I raise two hands.” “ These are my legs. 
I touch my leg—I touch my legs.” ‘These are my feet. I stamp 
one foot—I stamp both feet.” This should complete the first 
lesson. Exercise on the pronouns of the second and third persons 
should be left for a later one. 
A second lesson might teach the names of the school furnishings 
and the children’s school property, pronoun and sentence work 
following, as in the first, the simple naming. 
A third might teach through a toy tea- ‘or dinner-service—the 
property of the Kindergarten, or lent by one of the children for the 
occasion—the names of the furnishings of the table for meals and 
the actions of eating. 
Articles of clothing might provide the name-words in a fourth 
lesson. 
A fifth lesson, taken in the playground, might familiarise the 
children with names of things visible from this point of view, and 
put them into suitable sentences—short and simple. The lesson 
will also offer opportunity for teaching in sentences verbs which 
express the children’s outdoor actions. 
As the children’s knowledge of words and their use increases— 
and they will be learning all the time from their classmates as well 
as from their class lessons—it will be possible to extend the teaching 
to include the names of things not present before the children’s 
eyes during the lesson, and to actions which cannot be actually 
performed at the moment. Thus one lesson may deal with the 
business of undressing at night or dressing in the morning, another 
F

with that of getting ready for school, a third with the walk to school. 
The greetings between and ordinary school commands from 
teacher to children may be made a further valuable aid in language 
work, With a little skill the sentences in these cases may be made 
to form short and easy dramas which the children will thoroughly 
enjoy. It will be necessary throughout to see that the children 
have sufficient knowledge of the words dealt with to visualise the 
objects for which the name-words stand and to associate each verb 
with its appropriate action. 
When the children have a fair, working knowledge of the nouns, 
pronouns and verbs which enter most largely into their own and 
their teacher’s speech in school, adjectives and adverbs should be 
introduced into the sentence-work. The distinction between thds 
and that, each and every, etc., will have been taught ; and the num- 
eral adjectives will be familiar through the counting lessons pre- 
liminary to arithmetic. New work in the use of the adjective will 
teach the children to use it in describing objects, etc., the name- 
words for which are known—“ a clean frock,” “his dirty hands,” 
“your red chalk.” Adverbs will be brought in to modify state- 
ments of action or being with regard to time, place and manner : 
“T come to school early,” “T put it there,” “I will walk slowly,” 
The parts of the verb will need very careful teaching—of course 
always by use. Future tense might be learnt, for example, by talk- 
ing about what we are going to do to-morrow or in the holidays, 
and past tense through the telling of stories or narrating of some- 
thing which happened a while ago. Other parts of speech will be 
learnt incidentally through the sentence-work. Prepositions will 
need more systematic treatment. Owing to difference of idiom 
in English and Dutch they give much trouble. Teaching should 
also be brought to bear on the use of common conversational 
phrases and idioms. “ Did you see the book?” “ Ves, I did,” 
or “ Yes, I saw it” [to correct vulgarism “I ‘seen’ it”’]. “ This is 
your slate, is it not ?” [to replace Dutch idiom “ Not so ”’}. 
From this point the method to be followed in the two languages 
will be essentially the same. 
The best means of cultivating speech in early years has been 
pointed out. The proper subjects for these talks must now be 
considered. Conversation is easy only when interest is aroused ; 
and interest, as we have learnt, is closely associated with knowledge. 
We are interested in those things of which we know something.
-P-A-G-E-96
  The Cultivation of Speech 83 
Now, while individual children have special interests connected 
with some particular knowledge that they possess, there is much 
in their experience, especially if they are about the same age, that 
has awakened a common interest. This common interest rises 
out of their contact with things and their contact with people. The 
whole, then,of the children’s experiences—indoors and out of doors, 
at home and at school—and their relations with people are at our 
disposal for the purpose of these first talks. We can get them to tell 
us about the plants they have grown ; about the animals they keep 
as pets in the home, and those kept for use on the farm; about the 
sun and the rain and the wind ; about summer and winter ; about 
their walks to and from school and their holiday experiences ; about 
their father and mother and other people they know ; about farmer 
and fisherman, blacksmith, postboy and policeman ; about things 
that happen in their holidays and about the games they play. Bible 
lessons, nature studies, fairy tales, stories about animals, nursery 
rhymes, poems and songs will furnish further matter. 
It is important that we should know what part we ourselves are 
to play in order that the talks may have the fullest possible effect 
in improving and developing speech. Generally we must choose 
the subjects for them, although, occasionally, we may let the chil- 
dren do so. In carrying them on, we must remember that it is the 
nature of little children to tire soon of both objects and subjects 
unless there is some one at hand to help them from time to time to 
look at them in a new light. This, then, must be our work so far 
as the matter of the talks is concerned. We shall find that a sug- 
gestive question asked when knowledge seems exhausted and 
interest begins to flag will give their thoughts a new turn and make 
them eager to go on talking again. But we have to do more than 
keep the ball of conversation rolling. Part of our purpose is to 
make new words known to the children, and throughout the talks 
we must be on the look-out for places into which we can fit the 
words we wish them to know and use. In doing this we must be 
careful to see that we have introduced them in such a way that they 
carry their meaning with them and cannot possibly be misunder- 
stood. This is the way in which new words must always be brought 
to the notice of little children, for whom definitions are quite out 
of place. They will make their own definitions when they know them 
well enough, anid such an exercise should not be required of them 
before that time, :

It is also important, since speech is learnt by imiti ” 
talking with our pupils we tune our voices to a pleasan 
from tone to tone in speaking, give every consonant | 
for the sake of clearness, and every vowel its own sou! 
terests of purity of pronunciation ; that we do not hr 
but use pause and emphasis in a way that makes it 
children both to hear and understand what we say. We must 
speak, that is, “ purely, clearly, pleasantly and with force.” This 
we shall only do if we take the trouble to amend our own speech in 
any particular in which it is faulty—grammar, pronunciation, t 
modulation or accent—listening carefully to the speech of all 
cultured people we meet, and trying our best to speak like the: 
But while we never cease trying to make our own speech more 
exact and more fluent, we must remember that we must. not be too 
exacting with our pupils in Sub-Standard classes, or expect too 
much of them. If we make this mistake discouragement and 
shyness will result. We must be prepared to find that in spite of 
all our efforts they do not think very connectedly or speak with 
any close approach to exactness. Connected thought and exact 
speech are things of slow growth, and we must be cc © . 
for them till the children are considerably older ; but 
able to prune away their worst faults and, by alway, 
orderly ways of looking at things and speaking of

Suggestions for an early talk are given below to show how new 
words may be introduced, and how the children’s mistakes in pro- 
nunciation and in grammar may be dealt with in} * 
We will suppose that you have learnt that Chris

with his young master. Before the talk begins you"

beside him. You will then ask him to tell the clas

question: Why is he called Frisk? Somebody su 
he is fond of fun ; but says fon-da-fun. [Stop the tal.

sentence repeated by one or two children individually, and finally 
by the one who made the mistake. Be careful to see that the / of 
of is voiced ; that in fun, voiceless.] Christie having been asked 
whether it is safe, Molly is told to come out and feel Frisk’s coat. 
If Frisk is an Irish terrier she will say that it is rough. The new 
word “ shaggy ” may be taught, and one or two children be asked 
to run out in turn to say that Frisk has a shaggy coat. [See that 
the s sounds get their proper value. The first hisses, the second 
buzzes, the third says H’sh.] As Molly pats him he wags his tail. 
[Two more buzzing s’s.] Why is this? He likes being patted, 
and shows it in this way. [During a later talk on the cat it will be 
noticed that Kitty is not pleased when she waves her tail. Ina 
third talk, in which the dog and cat are compared, this will be 
one of the remembered points of difference.] Jim notices that 
he keeps turning his head to look into Christie’s face, and Mary, 
coming close to look, says that his eyes are brown. [But she uses 
the singular verb. The mistake must be corrected, Not explained. 
“ His eyes are brown.” Have the sentence repeated by the class, 
then by individuals, then by Mary herself. Afterwards vary it 
with “One eye is brown ”—‘ Both eyes are brown.” From the 
time that you first hear it be on the alert for this mistake, and the 
contrary, but less common, one of using a plural verb with a 
singular subject. Never let them pass uncorrected ; but make no 
reference to rules of grammar.] Susie points out that when 
Frisk hears a noise he moves his ears, and, on being asked, is 
bold enough to come up and feel them, They are very soft 
inside. [Singular verb again, perhaps, and the é of soft run on 
to the following vowel—sof’ tinside.] Yes, as soft as silk, you 
agree, and, the sentence affording good practice in s sounds, 
you have it said by the class and then by individuals: “ His 
ears are as soft as silk,” changing this to “ His ears are silky.” [All 
the final s’s in the sentence—in italics—are voiced, the initial 
ones, voiceless. In time we shall see that initial s is always voice- 
less ; but rules can be left for the standards.] Then Edward feels 
the nose and finds it cold. Frisk licks his hand, and he tells that his 
tongue—contrasted in a later talk with the cat’s—is soft. Christie 
is asked now if he can make Frisk show his teeth and, with the pride 
of ownership, he does so. Several little hands will be eager after- 
wards at your suggestion to hold the paws. The pads and the hard 
sharp claws are noted. Can the latter be drawn back into the pads ?
-P-A-G-E-99
86 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
Jim tries to push them. Frisk doesn’t like this and pulls : 
away. You tell that a dog’s claws cannot be “ sheath-ec

are able to hear him run. His claws tap on the ground v 
puts his feet down. 
The subject having now yielded all that is possible to th: 
vation of such little folk, Christie is invited to tell what 
noticed about his dog at home. This gives an opportunity for the 
beginning of continuous narrative, and has besidesthe effe — ~ 
ing Frisk as an animal friend, and thus of cultivating : 
kindness to animals. A little tactful suggestion will he 
to keep the thread of his narrative, and he will tell how he 
how big he was then, how he used to feed at first, what 
eat now, what he does during the night, what he does dr~in~ +h 
day, and what always makes him angry. A final questic: 
directed to finding out why Christie is fond of Frisk, ar

nature be made to give rise to a feeling of what we owe i: 
If time allows, close the lesson by asking round the class the various 
things already told. During this last exercise guide the order of 
the replies as well as possible, and try to get the children to use the 
new words taught, e.g. shaggy, silky, sheathed. 
By means of such class talks and of individu ~

through practice and the adding of new words to those the children 
are in the habit of using. New ideas will be more plentifully pro- 
vided through stories and poems, and to the use of these in speech 
cultivation we must now turn. 
Stories by the teacher must at first be short and very simple. 
They can.be taken from a variety of sources—the Bible, Greek 
and Roman mythology, collections of fables, legends, folk-tales, 
fairy tales and nature stories. An example follows to illustrate 
the quality of brevity necessary in the early stages. 
Demeter had a well-loved daughter Persephone. When Per- 
sephone was a little maiden she was one day wandering about the 
meadows of Enna in Sicily gathering white daffodils to wreathe 
in her long hair. Being tired she fell asleep, and the dark king of 
the underworld came in his golden chariot and carried her off to 
be his wife. At his touch the white daffodils turned yellow, and 
some of them, falling from Persephone’s hair as he bore her away, 
grew up in spring as yellow as we see them now. 
Demeter was very, very sad at the loss of her daughter. She 
roamed all over the earth seeking news of her ; and, learning after 
a long time who had borne her away, she begged him to give her 
daughter back to her. At last Pluto, the dark king, moved by her 
tears, agreed that Persephone should return to her mother for a part 
of every year. So each year she comes back to earth from theunder- 
world, and flowers starting up in her footsteps make the Spring. 
This story will take only a minute or two to tell. Frequently 
stories told to children in infant classes are too long. They take 
nearly the whole twenty minutes allowed for them by the time-table 
merely to tell once; and, when the children are called upon to 
retell them, they have only a vague memory of the beginning. 
A story half-hour once in the week might be kept for these longer 
stories by the teacher; but shorter ones which can be finished, 
and then re-told by several children, will give more practice and 
should be more frequently chosen. ‘The re-telling of the stories 
should be looked upon not as a task but as a treat. 
Tf the children seem unable to reproduce a story, a few sug- 
gestive questions should be asked ; as, for instance, “ What is the 
story about?” “ What was the little girl’sname?” “ What was 
her mother’s name?” “‘ What was Persephone doing?” “‘ Who
-P-A-G-E-101
88 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
bore her away?” andso forth. The answers to these questions 
should be gradually combined to form the continuous narrative 
required. Here, as elsewhere, the rule that answers should be in 
complete sentences must be applied with discretion ; but, as one 
important aim of story-telling is to train the children i in the power 
of connected expression, they must be encouraged to give such 
answers when the question allows of them. 
When a few questions have been answered, we may ask which 
of the children can tell as much of the story as they cover, and from 
among the volunteers may choose one to come out in front of the 
class and do so. We shall most likely find, at first, that the same 
half-dozen children volunteer every time. We must not be content 
to have these for our only story-tellers ; but must encourage the 
backward ones, helping them out when shyness overwhelms or 
memory fails them. 
During reproduction we should encourage the children to give 
the exact words of the story where desirable—of speeches, for in- 
stance, and of any striking phrase—not by stopping and correcting 
them, but by always repeating them exactly ourselves. We should 
not interrupt the children to correct, as in the talks, mistakes in 
grammar and pronunciation. Story-telling should be pure pleasure, 
and the children’s minds must be free to enjoy it. We must rely 
on our own model for correction to a large extent; but should 
make mental note of all mistakes and deal with them when we have 
a chance of doing so—during a subsequent talk, for example, or 
among the sound exercises preliminary to reading lessons. Except 
in the instances given, we should encourage the children to use their 
own words in place of those in the story ; but should note ugly and 
awkward turns of speech for correction at another time. We 
should not feel it necessary to point a moral when we tell a tale. 
If there is one we may leave the children to find it. They are very 
quick to do this, and also to apply it when found. 
After the telling and re-telling of a story the children should 
sometimes be asked to show by means of chalk drawings what 
ideas they have gained from it. Sometimes, too, the story should 
be turned into a play, and different parts be given to different 
children to act. They are born actors as they are born imitators, 
and we should give them opportunity to express themselves in all 
natural ways, for one form of expression helps another. There 
will be no need to make a stage and furnish it with scenery,
-P-A-G-E-102
ae 
ee The Cultivation of Speech 89 
for to the kindled imagination of the little actors rows of class 
desks will become cither the aisles of a forest or the waves of 
the sea as the drama, requires. 
A word should be’ added on the value of pictures as illus- 
trations. The illustrations of fairy tales that hang on infant school 
walls and delight the children by their rainbow colours, by the 
simplicity and directness of their representation, and by their 
crude humour suited to that of the children themselves, are com- 
monly taken down and hung in front of the class before the teacher 
begins to tell a story the scenes of which they depict. Pictures 
illustrating a story should not be before the children during the 
telling of it ; for one purpose of story-telling is to enable the chil- 
dren to form mind pictures of scenes and events by means of the 
words used, and the supplying of ready-made pictures beforehand 
keeps them from doing so. If it is felt that picture illustrations 
are necessary they should, as a general rule, be shown after, not 
before or during the telling of the story. Even this is not alto- 
gether advisable, for there are then two separate and contradictory 
impressions made on the children’s minds, with an effect similar to 
that of two photographs taken on one film. On the whole, it seems 
better to reserve pictures for brightening and making beautiful 
the walls of the schoolroom and for use in conversational lessons, 
and to trust for story illustrations to the children’s imagination 
sketches and our own sketches. 
At first all pictures or models used should be of very familiar 
creatures or things, and about these we must encourage the chil- 
dren to say allthat they can. We should invite questions, too, and 
try to answer them in such a way that the questioner tries harder 
than before, both to see and to say. We must not regard any- 
thing as trifling which is the result of effort or cause of inquiry 
on the part of our pupils, and so discourage them; but must do all 
that we can to give confidence to the children. Only by doing so 
can we get them to express themselves readily, and without ready 
expression there is not much hope of progress. A want of sym- 
pathy with their difficulties or an inability to appreciate their 
efforts will end in failure. On the other hand, sympathy is not to 
show itself in a readiness to accept anything but their best, and 
appreciation must not degenerate into weak praise of anything 
they may say. 
As the lessons progress novelty may be introduced by providing
-P-A-G-E-103
go The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
pictures and models of objects which are not familiar. The chil- 
dren’s past experience in observational work will enable them to 
find similarities and connections enough to make conversation 
possible. Objects in common use in other lands, scenes and 
people—particularly childrea—and products of far-away countries 
will rouse the children’s interest and make them try harder. 
In the youngest class the best verses to teach are nursery 
rhymes. They have delighted many generations of children, and 
will delight many more. Apart from any meaning the words may 
have, they sound a merry, jingling music that catches and charms 
the children’s ear. The ideas are simple, the words easy, and they 
are in every way just the thing to give children their first intro- 
duction to rhymed words. Some of the many charming nature 
poems published nowadays. might be chosen to supplement the 
nursery rhymes, while in Robert Louis Stevenson’s A Child’s 
Garden of Verses there is a store of child poems written by a poet 
who never lost the memory of his childhood, and wrote of and for 
children with a delicately sure touch. Other poems will suggest 
themselves, notably Blake’s Songs of Innocence,and those of William 
Allingham. 
The teaching must, of course, be oral throughout Sub-Standard 
classes. 
With a class of-very young children no wearisome effort should 
be made to get them to learn by heart. Slight repetition will 
suffice on the part of the children, but we ¢  * 
must quote the exact words of the recitatio: 
time to time the children should be taken bz 
to repeat the whole as far as learnt. This is i 
sisted in, it will prevent breaking down at the usual “ stop ~ 
Expression will come with understanding. If we list 
inflection of young children’s voices and the emphasis 
speech in the playground, at home, in the street, and 
parks and gardens—wherever they speak naturally of th 
interest them—we shall be convinced that there is no nee 
them expression. If we help them to see, to understan 
feel, they will show us how to express. Action should b 
in poems demanding it, but always under great restrai ae 
ture which is either mechanical or exaggerated is an annoyance tol 
the listeners and an injury to the child. We must alway

lated properly, much has been done. We must not expect young 
children to grasp fine shades of meaning—their thought is limited 
by their experience ; but each new. poem taught will-make them 
quicker in seizing the poet’s idea. 
We should make little change in our methods of speech culti- 
vation in the lower standards. The talks, stories and recitations 
should be continued, although less time can be given to them. 
The correction of errors should begin to be more systematic, and, 
when Standard III is reached, reference may be made to rules of 
grammar. Subjects of conversation should show a little advance, 
and more continuous and connected narrative should be expected. 
To supply new ideas, fairy tales, fables and legends should still be 
told and—to give practice in speech—re-told ; but gradually stories 
from history and others in which the scene is laid in unknown 
countries should be introduced. To secure continuous narrative 
at this stage, it will be well to require a brief summary of the last 
story or a piece of description from it before a new one is told, 
while the children will be delighted if they are allowed sometimes 
to exercise their own inventiveness by completing a story that 
we have told “so far.” Learning by heart must show develop- 
ment in the choice of poems and prose passages for memorising, 
for though the choice must still be governed by the children’s 
interests, these have widened considerably. : 
The oral work of the upper standards will differ from that of 
the lower in requiring more effort of memory, more continuity in 
narration, and consequently more knowledge of sentence-building 
and joining. Various subjects of instruction—reading, history, 
geography and natural science—will provide opportunity for 
exercises. Instead of the questioning suitable in lower standards 
we should at this stage require oral summaries of lessons and studies, 
From time to time a girl or boy should be called upon to stand 
before the class and describe a walk or holiday journey, or give 
an account of some book. 
When studying language and literature in these years the 
pupils must be trained to use their critical powers, which, from 
twelve to sixteen, develop rapidly. The result of this study 
should be to give them a finer feeling for beauty of words, of 
thythm, of fancy, and of its expression by means of figures of 
speech ; and the feeling should show itself in their own speech 
and writing. When this: point is reached, the school study of
-P-A-G-E-105
92 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
language and literature which began in the simplest speech prac- 
tice, may be regarded as finished. As the approach to it is made 
through exercises in composition we may leave details of method 
to be considered in the chapter on that subject. 
While mistakes in pronunciation should be dealt with inci- 
dentally at first, our own knowledge of these mistakes, of their 
causes, and of the best means of correcting them must from the 
beginning be full and systematised. This is not the place to teach 
the science of speech. The necessary knowledge must be gained 
from study of the subject in a manual which gives it full treatment 
(The Science of Speech, Dumville; Voice Training, Hulbert ; The 
Sounds of Spoken English, Rippmann ; and Dr. Robert Bridges’ 
recent book on English pronunciation are recommended); but, 
for the purpose of reference, the mistakes most commonly made 
are noted below, and an effort is made to point out the causes of 
them and to suggest the best means for their removal. It cannot 
be too strongly emphasized, however, that teachers who wish to 
make a success of this very important part of their work must 
discover for themselves the mistakes which their own pupils are 
in the habit of making and then, in the light of knowledge gained 
from a textbook dealing with speech sounds, take measures to 
remove them. As it will be necessary to refer to them, the symbols 
for English speech sounds are given in tables below.

When any of the vowels are sounded the vocal cords are brought 
into such a position that the breath in passing sets them vibrating. 
This vibration, communicated to the air passing out through the 
mouth, produces the musical sound called voice. All the vowels 
then, we say, are voiced. Consonants are either voiced or breathed 
(voiceless). Those which are voiced are formed partly in the throat 
(as the vowels are) by the vibration of the vocal cords, and partly by 
the closure or narrowing of the mouth ; those which are breathed 
are formed entirely by the closure or narrowing of the mouth. 
Several of the consonants differ from one another as to formation 
in this one particular only, being, as it were, two forms of the same 
sound : 
Breathed Form. Voiced Form.

keeping the hands pressed firmly over the ears: f,v; k, g, etc.

Note.—Besides making these additions to English consonant symbols the 
Phonetic Alphabet dispenses with certain symbols found in’ the ordinary 
alphabet ; namely, c (because its two sounds are represented by 4 and s respec- 
tively) ; 7 (except for consonantal y), which-is represented by dz; g (because 
its work can be done by 4w); and x (because it is represented by 4s or gs). 
The convenience of. adopting a scheme of phonetic symbols 
will be seen. The, letters of the ordinary alphabet. do little to
-P-A-G-E-108

eg The Cultivation of Speech 95 
show their sound values. Many of them (note @ particularly) 
are used for more than one sound; many sounds again are 
represented by a variety of symbols @ as in baby, for example, 
which is variously written as a-e (slate), ai (fail), ao (gaol, etc. etc.). 
Writing on speech sounds gains much in conciseness and clearness 
from the use of the phonetic alphabet, without which roundabout 
forms of expression must be used. In these notes sounds will be 
indicated both by their phonetic symbols and by means of type 
words, since the former are as yet unfamiliar. Words, for the same 
reason, will not be printed in phonetic characters. 
With regard to common forms of error Circular 11, 1913, of the 
Transvaal Education Department may be quoted : 
“ Examination and analysis of departures from standard pro- 
nunciation show that the great majority of errors in vowels as in 
consonant sounds are traceable to a general tendency to secure 
greater ease in production, and it will be found that slovenliness of 
utterance exists to an extraordinary degree in South Africa. It is 
no exaggeration to say that speech and reading are sometimes 
largely unintelligible to the unaccustomed ear.” 
The common forms of error are mainly due to three causes: the 
dropping of sounds hard to say in combination with others ; the 
inserting of sounds in order to make easier the change from one 
position of the speech organs to another ; the substituting of sounds 
easier to say than the correct one. There are also individual errors 
not due to any of these causes. 
Common Errors in Vowel and Diphthong Sounds : 
z (aas in at) is often given as € (e as in egg), a sound produced 
with less effort. The lower jaw is not dropped sufficiently, and 
the lips in consequence are not far enough apart. Among Dutch 
pupils it may be due to making too much effort to distinguish 
between Dutch and English pronunciation of the vowel sound in 
such words as “man.” But it is almost if not quite as common 
among English pupils, in the case of whom it is probably due to 
laziness.and a bad example. 
a (a as in father) is often given as 9} (a as in all). The fault is 
to some extent an affectation. It is brought about by rounding and 
closing the lips, raising at the same time the lower jaw. This
-P-A-G-E-109
96 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
trick of narrowing the mouth is a common one, and as an effort is 
required to prevent this narrowing, the error may be regarded. as 
due to laziness also. To correct it lips and teeth must be opened 
widely and the tongue must lie low and flat. 
e (a as in baby). Two mispronunciations of this sound are 
common. One, the tendency to make it into the diphthong ei: that 
is, ay (as in say) +}-ee (as in see),has been referred to as being generally 
heard. It also becomes ai; that is, ak-tee (as in see) being thus 
turned into a diphthong in two separate ways. To say it correctly 
the jaw must be raised and the front of the tongue kept fairly high. 
It must then be held steady in this position, as any change from it 
will convert the single vowel sound into a diphthong. 
ot (aasinall). In Native schools this vowel is frequently short- 
ened into 9 (0 as in not). It must be dwelt upon, In European 
schools it becomes 0 (0 as in go), the mouth being closed to the oh 
position and the lips too much protruded. The causes are the 
same as given in the case of a (a as in father) changed to 91 (@ as in 
all)—an affectation of refinement on the one hand, and the ease of 
common usage on the other. . 
& (e as in egg). Two errors, again, are common in the case of 
this sound. The neutral vowel murmur 9 (¢ as in learner) is often 
given for it. The cause is the lazy habit of speech which is so 
common, trouble not being taken to give the definite sound required, 
crisply. The opposite fault of over-pronouncing it—trailing it 
into e (a as in baby) is also heard frequently, fed becoming fade. 
It is one of the commonest and one of the ugliest mispronuncia- 
tions. It is also very hard to remove, as it is only distressing to a 
sensitive ear. Pupils should be made to place their vocal organs 
in the positions first for ¢ (e as in egg) and then for e (a as in baby). 
Practice of pairs of words pronounced similarly but for this one 
sound (fed . . . fade, etc.) will also be useful. A third mispro- 
nunciation of ¢ (e as in egg) changes it into i @ as in zt). Careless- 
ness and the force of a bad example are the probable causes. 
e: (long e before “r” asin there). Another ugly and common 
form of mispronunciation is heard in words containing this sound, 
81 (e as in there) being separated from the following “‘r”’ with which| 
it should be combined, and given the sound of e (aasin say). Thu 
there becomes thay-re ; Mary, May-ry, etc. etc. Again what i 
needed is crisp, clear utterance that prevents slovenly drawling, 
Where the vowel murmur takes the place of final “r” it is droppe:     
       
         
   
     
   
-P-A-G-E-110
The Cultivation of Speech 97 
with very irritating effect, as in “ fay hay ” for “ fair hair.” There 
is a possibility of affectation in the making of this fault also. 
i (and yas in pity). As for € (¢ as in egg) the neutral vowel 
murmur 0 (¢ as in learner) or even A (w as in wp), is substituted and 
from the same cause. The fault is most common in words of more 
than one syllable which have 7 in the last—eval, timid, civility, etc. 
Another substitution is that of i: (e as in he), his and him becoming 
“ hees” and“ heem.” Constant practice in changing from i (das in 
pity) toi: (eas in he) and vice versa is needed : 
it eat 
bit beat 
fit feat 
and 
heat hit 
meat mit 
peat pit. 
y (as in pity). When a vowel at the end of a word, this is very 
often given wrongly as i: (¢ as in he) both by Dutch- and English- 
speaking South Africans. A common example is reelee (for really) 
where, also, the two separate vowels preceding are lazily given as 
one. The i (short z as in it) sound should be exaggerated till the 
fault is corrected. 
2 (9 as in not). In native schools there are two common mis- 
pronunciations by which not becomes naught and note respectively. 
The pupil turns not into naught by dwelling on the vowel sound, 
and then having lengthened the vowel alters it again by bringing 
his lips into the oh position. ‘To correct the second fault the lips 
must be kept broadly open ; to correct the first the vowel must be 
sounded crisply and clearly. In European schools the former 
fault is fairly common, and an “‘r” is sometimes inserted, as in 
* orff ” for “ off.” 
«and v (w as in up and pull). Mispronunciations are not so 
frequent in the case of these vowels. One example, however, may 
be given: “ just ” which becomes “ jest ” or “jist.” An opposite 
tendency is heard in “ thutty ” for “ thirty.” 
ait (a as in father -e as in he=7 as in kind). When a (aas in 
father) becomes 9 (0 as in not) the diphthong is also mispronounced 
and “ tdle,” for example, becomes “ toil.” The fault results from 
rounding the lips in saying the broad a (as in father) and dwelling 
G
-P-A-G-E-111
98 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
on the second sound of the diphthong it (e as in he). Like so many 
other mispronunciations it arises from the tendency to speak with 
as little trouble as possible, 9 being easier to say than a. The 
open position of the mouth must be maintained while a is said. 
The a and it should then be practised separately at first and 
then rapidly run together. Pairs of words such as tile, toil, 
should then be sounded in order that the difference. may be 
brought out. : 
au (ow as in now), There is a tendency to give the two sounds 
of the diphthong (a as in father+00 as in too) separately instead of 
in combination. Frequently, too, it is sounded as though the short 
vowel ¢ (¢ as in egg) preceded the diphthong. This is slipped in 
during the change of position necessary for saying the vowel sound 
after the initial consonant. It isa very unpleasant sound, and effort 
should be made to correct it. The two sounds of the diphthong a 
(as in father) and 00 (as in too) should be practised, separately 
at first and then by rapid conjunction. The initial consonant 
should then be prefixed while the mouth is broadly open for the 
following a. 
oi: (a as in all+e as in he). The two elements are given 
separately instead of in conjunction. Occasionally also 9: (a as in 
all) is given the closed sound of o (as in go). The two sounds 
must be practised, the conjunction being made more and more 
rapidly, and the mouth must be kept more broadly open on the 
former. 
u (00 as in too). As in the case of au a vowel resembling e (as 
in egg or et (as in he) is sometimes slipped in before the true vowel 
sound with very unpleasant effect. The cause and remedy have 
been suggested. 
Common Errors in Consonant Sounds 
As these lend themselves to classification in the four groups of 
errors distinguished on a previous page they will be dealt with 
according to that grouping. 
_ () Errors due to the dropping of sounds difficult in conjunction. 
Dropping of “7.” The fault common when this is represented 
by the vowel murmur a (e as in learner) has been remarked on 
among vowel ‘mispronunciations. The dropping of the first “r” 
from “secretary” and “February” (leaving “sek’etary” and
-P-A-G-E-112
The Cultivation of Speech 99 
“ Feb’uary ”)is very common. The sound is sometimes left out 
between two vowels, “ moreover ” becoming, for example, “ mo’e- 
over.” 
Dropping of “g.” “Strength” becomes stren’th. From “ Eng- 
land” the unrepresented (hard) g-sound which should follow the 
pronunciation of the xg is omitted. To correct the fault such words 
should first be sounded as far as the point of difficulty, a new effort 
being made, after a pause, to finish : ¢.g., strength, Eng-+-(g)land. 
The presence (in sounding) of the unrepresented g, must be em- 
phasized in the case of the latter word. 
Note : -—The dropping of ¢ in such combinations as ats (eg. insects) is 
also common, the cause and remedy being the same.- 
Dropping of “h.” A very common fault heard in the case of 
both initial and medial “h,” as for example, ’istory and in’abit. 
The practice in the case of “have” has regulted in “would of 
been,” Pupils who find it hard to attach this initial breathing 
sound may be told during some recess to run up and down the play- 
ground for two or three minutes ; then, returning breathless to the 
teacher, to say: “ He did it, he didit, he/” (Suggested in Clear 
Speaking and Good Reading—Burrell.) But the fault is due 
less to. inability to produce it than to bad habit and the force of 
example. 
Dropping of “d” (and 1). This is common when another 
consonant follows, especially from the end of and—e.g., “ boys an’ 
girls.” When a vowel follows, the d (or t) is transferred to it, as in 
“ ever an’ d’ever,” “ aun’ ’tan’ d’uncle.” 
(2) Errors due to insertion of sounds to make transition easier. 
Insertion. of “7.” This is often made between two vowel 
sounds (cf. dropping of this letter, above) as, for example, in “ the 
law-r of the Lord.” It is due to the ease with which this “ r ” runs 
into a following vowel. An effort is necessary to say two separate 
consecutive vowels (as in “ law of”), and this effort is not generally 
made. The. effort must be insisted on, a pause between the vowels 
being required ‘at first. 
Insertion of indefinite vowel murmur. This occurs, between an 
initial consonant and r following : t(e)rain, g(e)reat. It is probably 
due to the difficulty experienced in passing from the initial con- 
sonant to ther... Practise in sounding such combinations as br, cr, 
dr, fr, gr, etc,

100 = The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
(3) Errors due to substitution of easier sounds for harder ones. 
The substitution of breathed for voiced consonants is one of the 
commonest mistakes in the pronunciation of South Africans. 
While probably caused in the first instance by difference of usage 
in Dutch and English the fault has spread so by infection that it is 
now made equally by English-speaking pupils who have not the 
same excuse for it. 
d becomes t at the end of words; the substitution of i ¢ as in it)for 
& (¢ as in egg) accompanying, and making “ expected ” “ expectit ’ 
and “wicked” “ wicket.” “And” becomes “ent.” Voiced s 
becomes breathed 6 as,in “ hiss” (or “heess”) for “his.” To correct 
the fault classified ists of words similar except in this one parti- 
cular (¢.g., bat-| -bad) should be made, and the words practised until 
the different sounds are impressed on the mind in association 
-with their proper symbols. : 
It is \ diffieul t'to see why j (sound of y in you) should 
become’ ei { Hequently does, dz (sound of 7 in jump) in the case of 
“yes,” which is said like Jess,” as in this case a harder sound is 
‘substituted for an easiet x ‘ane.. Perhaps speakers aware of a general 
‘tendency misapply. thexemedy. 
j (sound of y, in jou) i is substituted for “h,” “Come here ” 
being sounded as “Come yere.” The cause is the greater ease with 
which the latter can be said. _ 
(4) Errors less easy to classify. 
With regard to these the Transvaal Circular may again be 
quoted: “There are many forms of error that cannot be easily 
classified : they arise usually from misplacement of accent, from 
-jerkiness of utterance, from lack of light and shade in expression, 
and from an inability to articulate sounds clearly: the general 
effect of these .. . is to make the reading or speech blurred and 
indistinct.” 
The special treatment necessary in the case of certain specified 
errors has been pointed out, but general systematic treatment is 
‘necessary during the cultivation of speech and the teaching of 
reading from the earliest to the latest stages. This general treat- 
ment will consist of breathing exercises, mouth exercises and 
practice of lists of sounds arid words. 
‘An excellent and simple scheme of breathing exercises suitable 
‘for use before speech, reading, and singing lessons is given in 
The School Teacher’s Music Guide (Venables: Curwen ‘& Sons).

A fuller set of exercises, giving in addition to those for breathing, 
others for strengthening the muscles of “the chest, lungs, throat, 
neck, and jaws will be found in Clear Speaking and Good. Reading 
(Arthur Burrell : Longmans), a book of great value to teachers 
because of its practical suggestions with regard to the teaching of 
speech, reading, and recitation. The exercises for the mouth, 
as specially necessary for the correction of some of the faults of 
speech common in our schools, are, by permission, quoted below : 
x. Open the mouth wide. 
2. Open and close the mouth rapidly. 
3. Twist lower jaw to left and right: 
4: Bring upper teeth over lower. 
5. Bring lower teeth over upper. 
6. Purse the lips for whistling ; shape 
them for 00; for ok, for aw, for ah ; but 
emit no sound. (Maximum to times.)

These mouth exercises—with the exception of the last—are 
more suitable for home than for class practice, once the proper:
-P-A-G-E-115
102 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
positions and movements have been taught and mastered. The 
pupils should be urged to practise them before a glass, and, from 
time to time, individuals, whose speech shows the greatest need 
for them, should be privately examined on them. 
For the practice of clear utterance of difficult sounds several 
lists should be prepared. In the earliest the vowel and consonant 
sounds should be given in groups. Later, lists of words containing 
difficult combinations, as, for instance, breadths, sects, strength, 
tsetse. Later still, sentences presenting doubled consonants will 
be useful for overcoming the laziness or carelessness in speaking 
which results in one sound being made to do duty for two, “ Sleep 
peacefully,” “Bob bothers so,” “He made David go,” are ex- 
amples of this. type of sentence. It will be found that the ten- 
dency to run final and initial into one sound is greatest-when the 
same vowel sound precedes and follows, as in the examples above. 
Another useful exercise is the practising of pairs of sentences 
which emphasize the need for giving each consonant its full value 
and for separating words properly : 
“T had a nice, cold drink,” “I had an ice-cold drink.” 
Individual sounds that are found difficult should be repeated 
in conjunction with slightly different sounds. The following sen- 
tence (from Hulbert’s Voice Training) has been made with a view 
to providing this practice : 
“The Duke paid the money due to the Jew before the dew 
was off the ground on Tuesday, and the Jew having duly acknow- 
ledged it said adieu to the Duke for ever.” 
A variety of exercises of the kind will be found in Salmon’s 
Art of Teaching, and in Hulbert’s Voice Training. 
In addition to faults of speech arising from bad example, bad 
teaching, and slovenly habits of speaking, there are others trace- 
able to some physical defect or mental weakness. Some of these 
will be beyond our power to remove, requiring the services of 
doctor or dentist. In such cases we should try to. discover the 
nature of the trouble, and urge upon the parents the necessity of 
having the matter attended to. Bad cases of stammering and 
lisping may also refuse to yield to our efforts; but, as a general 
tule, in ordinary cases improvement follows upon suitable treat- 
ment if it is persisted in. 
Stammering, in the majority of cases, is largely a nervous com- 
plaint. The first thing to be done, therefore, is to tone up. the
-P-A-G-E-116
The Cultivation of Speech 103 
physical health so that the system may have a better chance of 
throwing off the tyranny of the nerves. It is of the first impor- 
tance, of course, that all conditions likely to cause or increase 
nervousness be removed. Stammerers should never be hustled 
and hurried into speech, should never be spoken to impatiently 
or have their nerves jarred in any avoidable way. When the 
right conditions prevail the following exercises should be en- 
joined : - : 
1, Speaking slowly in front of a mirror set words and phrases. 
2. Practising set chest and lung exercises. 
3. Practising breathing out exercises, especially blow-pipe 
breathing.! 
. 4. Blowing pith or celluloid balls about a large polished table 
—t hr. at a time. 
5. Beating time with the finger when speaking. 
6. Singing, Singing on monotone, dropping into speaking, 
practising whispering. 
7. Reading and reciting aloud and singing with a non- 
stammerer. 
Lisping is due to a want of adjustment between the teeth and 
tongue, or sometimes to a defective state of the teeth. It is heard 
on all s sounds, and on r, ch, and 7. 
For the necessary exercises given below lispers must be made 
to join the teeth carefully at the most natural position of the bite, 
using the fingers, if necessary, to adjust them, and making the 
adjustment in front of a mirror. They must then keep the sides 
of the tongue from pressing outwards and : 
1. Whistle softly ten times in succession, accenting well the first 
of each series of three. 
2. Repeat the following sounds in the same manner: s, ; 
sh, sh; ch, 4. 
3. Repeat the same sounds, prefixing to each in turn the vowels 
00, oh, aw, ah, ur, air, ay, ee. The teeth will need carefully ad- 
justing after each vowel sound. 
1 Blowpipe breathing may be done with the stem of a long pipe and a 
glass of water. The bubbles should go on rising without any cessation for 
five minutes at a time, the necessary air for this being held in the cheeks 
and natural breathing going on regularly through the nose meanwhile.

THE TEACHING OF READING 
* Books, we know, 
Are a substantial world both pure and good. 
Round these, with tendrils strong as flesh and blood, 
Our pastime and our happiness will grow.” —WorDSWORTH. 
«©All that men have devised, discovered, done, felt or imagined lies 
recorded in books.” ——CARLYLE. 
“‘The reading which we should try to cultivate is intelligent reading, 
that is, it should express the meaning of each passage clearly ; sympathetic 
reading, that is, it should convey the feeling delicately; musical reading, 
that is, it should move in accord with the melody and harmony of what is 
read, be it prose or verse.” —DoWDEN. 
WE have seen that when any new subject is taken up, motives 
for effort are needed at the outset. When little children, during 
their earliest schooldays, are learning to talk more freely, more 
clearly and more accurately, they are urged forward by their need. 
to understand and their desire to be understood by their teacher 
and class fellows. Motives for learning to read are to be found in 
its value to the reader himself, for “all that men have devised, 
discovered, done, felt or imagined lies recorded in books ”—and in 
the delight the power to read aloud—rendering “‘ the charmed sound 
of noble utterance with thrilling melody ”—may be made to yield 
to others. 
Very little children, of course, cannot appreciate these motives, 
and when they first come to school have not, in most cases, any 
desire to learn to read. It-is one of the first duties of the school to 
awaken this desire, for close intercourse with good books will 
furnish two things its pupils lack to the great impoverishing of their 
lives—ideas, and a sufficiency of words for the expression of ideas. 
It is the want of these, far more than the want of money, that makes 
their real poverty in after life, and it is in the power of the school to 
105
-P-A-G-E-119
106 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
remove it. If it is to do so, however, the teaching of reading ir 
schools must have certain definite results. Children w! 
learnt during school years to read with ease and to look 
as a means of enjoyment, will not, we may be sure, w : 
much to do with books when school years are over. 
therefore, are of great importance—the choice of a goo | 
teaching, and the provision of enjoyable matter for rez, 
In choosing our method for teaching we must be guided by a 
consideration of what reading is. It is, in its earliest: : 
association of printed symbols with familiar sounds for '

to this definition ; but that is what reading is in th:

many associations have been made). when he sees any a

But this is not where reading ends. It is only whe 
What we desire to give our pupils is the power, na

—between sign and idea—because the children haw

the children’s minds. We tell them to say a certain sou 
look at a certain sign, knowing that as they do so the

our symbol) well, spring to their minds. Later they v 
to associate symbol with idea without the help of sound. They 
will then be able to read silently, gathering ideas for themselves 
from the printed page. 
This brings us to a question for decision. What must be the 
marks, or signs or symbols, which we present to our pupils in 
their first reading lessons? They must be whole words, because for 
little children it is with whole words that ideas are associated, not 
with their separate parts or letters. They did not learn to say their 
first words—“ dadda,” “ mamma,” “babba,” “milk”’—letter by 
letter or even sound by sound. They learnt to say them.as wholes,
-P-A-G-E-120
  EE 
  The Teaching of Reading 107 
and it is with the whole word that their idea of their father or their 
mother, of their own personality or of their food, is associated: 
How did they learn the words at all? They heard them ; they 
heard them over and over again, and at last they said them. So 
they learnt to speak, and when they are learning to read they must 
follow the same process. Only, as the later accomplishment is 
dependent on sign instead of on sound (which is needed merely as 
a link in the early stages and for other purposes later) they must 
see instead of hearing—see, and see, and see, and in order to see, 
look. They must look and say. 
What we havetorememberis that each wordintheirreading books 
is to all intents and purposes a small object at which the children 
must look, as they will look if they are not taught to do otherwise, 
exactly as they look at any other small object, gaining a general 
idea of its whole appearance—not noting its parts successively and 
then combining them to form the whole. Consider for a moment 
what plan we adopt when we wish to draw the attention of any 
small child to the domestic cat. We do not say: “‘ Here isa head, 
here is a long body, here is a waving tail and here are four legs ”’ 
(most certainly we do not first isolate these. parts and present 
them separately), “all these together make the cat,” but simply : 
“Look at Kitty!” and the child looks and gets a general im- 
pression of Kitty to which fresh detail is added each time he looks 
at it, until he knows the parts of the household pet as well as we do. 
So with the words in his reader. He gets a general impression of 
them the first time he meets with them, and this impression is 
made clearer.and gains in detail each time they recur in the course 
of his reading. Of course, the words are much smaller than the 
cat and the differences between them mote minute than those 
between the cat and other objects to which his attention is 
drawn. Consequently he needs to look at them more often in 
order to distinguish between them. And how much more often 
he does do so! The words the and them, for instance, may occur 
dozens of times in a single lesson. 
This ‘‘ Look-and-Say ” method is the only method -by which 
children learn to read ; just as the ‘‘ Hear-and-Say ”’ method is the 
only one by which they learn to speak. There has been much dis- 
cussion of methods. It is all beside the mark. Several objections 
have been urged against the “ Look-and-Say” method. They 
are all removable or negligible.
-P-A-G-E-121
108 ‘The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
It has been urged, for example, that as the children’s attention 
is fixed on whole words when learning to read by this method, they 
confuse words of similar form as, for instance, though, thought, 
through and thorough. This is true of their early reading ; but the 
confusion disappears later. In the same way little children confuse 
one fur-covered animal with another, or even a muff with the cat ; 
but we do not distress ourselves or them about the mistake. We 
point it out, perhaps, (as teachers, we must point out the confusions 
in reading), adding a word or two to aid distinction ; but we know 
that repeated seeings will set the matter right. 
Another objection urged against the method is that the chil- 
dren are not helped to spell by it. This is not true. They are 
helped to spell, because every time they look at a word as a whole, 
its form tends to.impress itself on the eye with more clearness 
until at last the eye readily detects the mis-spelling of any familiar 
word, We may admit that the method does not teach spelling 
quickly ; but that is not what we are trying to do by means of it. 
We use, or should use, it for the purpose of teaching reading 
quickly. Spelling is more concerned with writing than with 
reading, although reading is a valuable incidental aid. Conse- 
quently, throughout the school course, and particularly in the 
early stages, reading and writing should be closely associated. 
After every reading lesson certain words—those particularly which, 
because of their similarity to other words, or through some irre- 
gularity of form, may cause mistakes~should be set as a writing 
exercise. In the same way if we desired to impress the details of 
the cat’s form on a child’s mind, our best plan would be to set him 
to draw it. Writing is the drawing of those smaller “ objects ?’— 
words. tis during writing lessons, and not before reading lessons, 
that the alphabet—the letters by their forms and names—should 
be taught, and even in writing lessons the letters should not be 
taught in alphabetic order, as will be seen later. 
A third objection raised against the ‘“ Look-and-Say.” method 
is that the use of it leads to indistinct utterance. But slovenly 
enunciation is a matter of habit arising out of constant uncon- 
scious imitation of slovenly speech. If a child hears language 
spoken clearly and purely at home, and then learns to read by the 
* Look-and-Say ” method in the class of a teacher who speaks. dis- 
tinctly and with purity of vowel sound, his utterance will compare 
favourably with that of a child who has learnt of a bad speaker
-P-A-G-E-122
The Teaching of Reading 109 
by any other method. It is not, therefore, the method which is 
at fault. 
Lastly, it is urged that however quickly children may learn by 
the “ Look-and-Say ” method to read words that have first been 
pronounced for them by a teacher, it gives them no help at all in 
mastering new words when they are reading by themselves. . But 
as all words are combinations of certain of the same twenty-six 
letters, the children are helped in this particular. Unconsciously 
as they read, day after day, they are gaining knowledge of the 
powers—the usual sounds—of the various letters, and they apply 
this knowledge to:any new words they meet with: Because of the 
irregularity of the English language they will make mistakes. 
Having learnt the sound of 7 in “in,” they may give it the same 
sound in “mind,” but such mistakes can be corrected as they 
occur, and the number of them will lessen as the children’s fami- 
liarity with words and their ways increases. 1 
But while none of these objections is a sufficiently weighty 
argument against the use of a method which is the only one by 
which children learn to read, the last two point to the advisability 
of supplementing it by one which places more emphasis on individual 
sounds. 
Such a method is the “ phonic ” (Gk. phoné,a sound), Accord- 
ing to this method words are pronounced by saying in succession 
the powers, values, or sounds of the separate letters forming them. 
The method demands a perfect alphabet, and the English alphabet, 
as we know, is very imperfect. Consequently, to. get the full 
benefit of it for the teaching of English reading, certain devices 
in printing—either variations in the form of, or the addition of 
marks to, the usual printed characters—must be adopted in order 
that each separate sound may be represented by a single symbol. 
In using it merely as a supplementary method, however, we may 
dispense with these devices, simply making a list of all the sounds 
in the language and teaching them in connection with a type word. 
When this has been done all faults of enunciation or pronunciation 
may be corrected by means of drill exercises in pronouncing, sound 
by sound, such words as demand the treatment. These exercises 
may be given either before or after the lesson. When all the sounds 
of the language have been taught systematically, the drill should 
be confined to words in which mispronunciations have been de- 
tected. While great improvement in utterance will result from
-P-A-G-E-123
110 ~— The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
using the method in this way, there should be no attempt to teach 
reading by means of it. For that purpose it is quite unsuited, 
because as has been said, children in learning to read must—and 
do-—recognise words as wholes. The knowledge of the powers or 
sounds of letters which the method gives will enable the children to 
make out occasional new words, but that is the most that can be 
expected of it in that direction. 
In brief, then, children must be taught to read by the “ Look-and- 
Say ” method ; from the very beginning writing must be connected 
with reading in order that they may gain that more exact know- 
ledge-of the form of words needed for spelling ; and exercises in 
the sounding of familiar words according to the “ phonic ” method 
must be introduced to correct faults of utterance and give closer 
acquaintance with the sound values of the alphabetic signs. 
We have, in South Africa, a special need for this use of the 
“ phonic ” method:in the errors and confusions of pronunciation 
resulting from our admixture of languages. These errors and con- 
fusions are so deep-rooted now that they can only be removed 
from the speech. and reading of our pupils by their obtaining this 
more exact knowledge of the separate sounds which together make 
up any given word. Whatever the language in which reading is 
being taught, drill exercises in sounding will improve pronuncia- 
tion ; and Dutch, being more phonetic than English, lends itself 
.to the method more readily. 
The teaching of reading is very often begun too early in schools. 
Little children frequently have books given to them for a reading 
lesson, or are asked to attend to a reading sheet, on their first day at 
school. This is quite wrong. There should be no formal attempt 
‘to teach children to read until they can speak with some ease. 
Reading lesson time for the first few days should be given to 
finding out whether the children have gained this power of speech. 
If, as is very probable, they have not, reading lessons must be 
put off until they acquire it by the means suggested in the last 
chapter, : 
Even when, having gained ease in speech, they are ready to 
‘learn ‘to read, books or reading sheets should not be too abruptly 
‘introduced. « Little children need to be prepared for their reading 
‘lessons in two ways. We have seen that at first reading is the 
association of signs with sounds, This work, which they will have
-P-A-G-E-124
The Teaching of Reading Il 
to do in reading, should be linked on to something similar to it in 
their past experience. No difficulty attaches to this necessary pre- 
liminary, for little children are accustomed to use signs for sounds 
in the expression of ideas. They nod their heads for “‘ Yes” and 
shake them for “No”; they put a finger on their lips for “ Be 
quiet ” and wave their hands for “ Good-bye.” In all these cases 
they are using a sign for a sound. It is easy for us, therefore, to get 
them to understand the use of printed speech signs, After gaining 
from them some such examples of muscular signs as are given above, 
and accustoming them to the meaning of the word sign, we can tell 
them that we are going to make some new signs on the board, and 
that the signs we make will, like those they have been talking about, 
“speak” to them Without sound. We should tell them further 
that their part in the game will be to learn and tell what the 
new printed signs say. We should then print on the board a 
number of words which they are in the habit of using and 
teach the children what to say when they see them. This work 
connects symbol with sound, the only necessary exercise at this 
stage, because all the words supplied by the teacher will be familiar 
ones and the connection of sound and idea will have been made 
previously in learning to talk, Speech is idea plus sound ; writing 
is idea plus sign ; reading, in its earliest stage, is sign plus sound plus 
idea ; later, it is sign plus idea plus (in the case of reading aloud 
only) sound. When single words are printed on the board they 
should be notional ones, each one, that is, capable by itself of giving 
rise to a notion or idea. Relational words, which have not this 
power, should be introduced in sentences where they will be recog- 
nised more easily. 
This work should be continued until the children have learnt a 
fair number of familiar words, and are able to read them when they 
are printed together on the board to form greetings and commands 
and such little speeches as the children themselves make at home 
and in school. They may then be led to tell that spoken words are 
not only used in ordinary talking, but for the purpose of telling 
stories ; and they should be told that printed words are also used 
for telling stories. Short ones may be printed on the board but 
for longer ones they must turn to books. 
At this point we might promise to read our next story instead of 
telling it, and afterwards might continue to do this from time to 
time until their desire to read for themselves is kindled. In this

way we shall have made the second preparation necessary | 
ing them what they will find in books and what pleasur: 
can give. They will then be more ready for formal readin; 
It will be seen that the plan suggested above for the vi 
liminary to formal reading lessons, ignores altogether the letters a 
the alphabet as single separate symbols, and makes no attempt t 
teach their names. Such ‘instruction has nothing whatever to d 
with the teaching of reading. The children will need to kr | 
names, but the time to teach them is during early writin 
for in writing our pupils must perforce form one single le 
another, and it will be an advantage to them then to } 
letter names. While a knowledge of these was necessa

in the real sense, was concerned. Even when taught

The Teaching of Reading "113 
such repetitions, and as the subject-matter of them is very inferior’ 
to that of a good fairy-tale they should be dropped out of early 
reading practice. 
During this earliest reading lessons we should use our pupils’ 
knowledge of the power of printed words to call up ideas just as 
spoken words do, and should tell them that the time has come for 
them to learn to read stories for themselves. We must then see 
that we take our reading lessons in such a way that our pupils’ 
eagerness is not checked by our methods. There should be -no 
wearisome repetitions, no tiresome interruptions to ask what 
this word means or that, no crossness and scolding that cause 
the children to think of their reading lessons as something un- 
pleasant. Repetitions will occur naturally in the text. Questions 
on meaning may be deferred ; if we have chosen our reading 
matter well there will be little danger of its not being understood. 
Crossness and scolding will be unnecessary if we know how to 
manage our class. The books of tales should be given out and one 
story chosen for the day’s reading. When the books are all opened 
we should point out to the children that among the words on the page 
are many familiar ones, and, after having had a few of them picked 
out and read, should warn the children to be on the look-out for, 
and to read with us, all that they recognise. We should then begin 
to read the story straight through, slowly enough for them to 
recognise and read familiar words ; but quickly enough to enable 
them to realise that they are reading a story and not simply saying 
words, for the sense of what they are reading should help them to 
recognise the words as they come. The expressiveness of our own 
reading will, of course, be of great assistance in this. 
When the story has been read there will be many words in it 
which the children will not recognise on next meeting with them ; 
but they will occur over and over again in other stories and so, by 
degrees, will become familiar. This makes it unnecessary for our 
pupils to read and re-read the same story or, worse, the same two 
or three paragraphs, after their interest in it is exhausted. They 
should read in this way one story after another till the book is 
finished. When all the stories have been read once we may allow 
them to choose from among them favourites to be read again, or we 
may put the book aside and begin a new collection. Such a plan 
will be found to have much better results, even on examination days, 
than the one frequently followed of having a single book read 
H
-P-A-G-E-127
114 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
through and through from cover to cover, unmindful of the chil- 
dren’s interest, in the hope that they will be able to read and spell 
all the words which occur in it. Two or three collections of stories 
—even half a dozen—should not be unobtainable, for most educa- 
tional firms publish suitable ones at twopence or threepence 
‘each. 
Reading lessons for children in the standards may be conveni- 
ently considered in two divisions—those for younger and those 
for older pupils. Those of the lower division differ in nature and 
method from those of the higher, because younger children have 
to battle with difficulties of one kind, and older children with diffi- 
culties of another kind. 
In the lower standards the overcoming of mechanical difficulties 
takes up’ a larger proportion of time. The forms of many words 
are still unfamiliar to our pupils and the sounding of them is still a 
cause of stumbling. 
Familiarity with the forms of words results from meeting with 
them frequently in reading and writing. During reading lessons, 
then, we must see that our pupils get as much practice as we can 
give them. This must not only be practice in reading aloud ; it 
must also be practice in reading alone. During simultaneous 
reading there is little real progress made in the recognition of words 
by individuals. The pace of the class reading sweeps them past the 
words they do not know without giving them time to look before 
saying them. Consequently they do not feel any more sure of 
them next time they meet with them. They do not even say 
them with any degree of correctness at the time, merely echoing 
what they think they have heard as they follow in the wake of the 
main body of the readers. Two separate faults which are enemies 
‘of good reading are therefore encouraged by simultaneous reading— 
the fault of not looking carefully and that of not saying correctly. 
A better way of increasing the admittedly short time for reading 
practice is to form the class into small groups for the purpose 
and to take each group in turn, setting the rest of the class to read 
silently. While this does not increase the amount in fact, it does 
in. effect ; for each of the children in any of the small groups will

of wlesson, and to read a long paragraph once a week helpsa child 
more-with his reading, than to read a line or two every day. 
While the sounding of words is not an essential part.of reading,
-P-A-G-E-128
The Teaching of Reading .. 115 
it is a necessary accompaniment of school reading which has to be 
tested. Children, of course, could léarn to read without ever read- 
ing aloud ; but normal children are never likely to do so in schools, 
We can only judge of our pupils’ progress in the art of reading when 
we hear them read aloud. Almost/all their reading in the early 
stages, therefore, must be reading aloud, since we must see that they 
are improving from day to day. . Nor is it only the need of testing, 
and aiding progress during learning that makes it desirable that 
they should learn to read aloud. Nearly everyone is called upon 
to read aloud at some time or other; and while, perhaps, not a 
large proportion of the children in any class will ever care to read 
aloud for their own pleasure, or need to do so for that of others, they 
should have opportunity of mastering an art which is capable of 
yielding so much. 
As, then, reading aloud will always be required of school chil- 
dren, if only because it is the readiest means of proving that they 
are making progress, it follows that it. should be as perfect as pos- 
sible, neither sound nor sense being mutilated. We have now to 
consider how it is to be taught. 
Good reading—like pleasant, forceful speech—demands the 
exercise of all the vocal organs: of the lungs no less than of the 
tongue, teeth, and lips. Such breathing and mouth exercises as 
have been suggested for use during the cultivation of speéch must 
be continued throughout the teaching of reading. Breathing exer- 
cises should be practised regularly for two or three minutes before 
every lesson, and such mouth exercises as are seen to be necessary 
should ‘be suggested for private practice by individual children. 
After the breathing exercises we should give two or three minutes’ 
drill on sounds commonly mispronounced by our pupils. From 
among all which we have—or should have—noted in a list we should 
pick’ out two or three which recur in the lesson for the day. This 
drill may just as suitably follow the reading practice, being directed 
then to correcting faults which have been made. 
When the vocal exercises for the day are over there should be 
some form of.introduction to the chosen reading matter. In Sub- 
Standard classes no formal introduction to the lesson is necessary or 
advisable. The little books of fairy-tales having been passed to 
the children, it will be enough for us to say: “‘This morning we shall 
read the story of Cinderella,” if that be the tale chosen ; or, when 
the childen are familiar with the tales in the book, to ask : ‘‘ What
-P-A-G-E-129
116 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
story shall we read this morning?” Continuing: “Have you 
read—or heard—this story before ? What is it about?” Then, 
having obtained a very broad outline of it, we may say: “Yes. 
Now find the page, and begin.” 
But something more than this is necessary for standard children 
——even for those of the lowest standard. Their first introduction 
to reading is over, and they should now be able to gain more of its 
benefits and be able to carry away from each lesson a distinct im- 
pression and understanding of the matter read. This should further 
enable them to give the gist of it in their own words, as well as to 
paraphrase intelligently chosen phrases. ‘The substituting of one 
word for another is a much less valuable, as it is a much more 
difficult, exercise. There are few exact synonyms in English, and 
to ask for substitutes for single words is, frequently, to task the 
pupils too heavily. The exercise, indeed, is either too easy to be 
of value or too hard to be fair. On the other hand, the children, 
even at this early age, ought to be able to give a short phrase from 
the book in their own words without doing violence to the meaning. 
Now, it will be much easier for the children to understand the 
various parts of the story—or other matter—read, if they have a 
general idea of the whole before they begin to read it. For this 
reason their minds should be prepared for the reading by some brief 
form of intelligent introduction. ‘The nature of this will vary with 
the conditions under which the story is read, If it is a new story 
the title, or a picture in the book illustrating it, forms a natural and 
satisfactory method of approach. In using either we must, of 
course, refer it to something within the children’s knowledge or 
experience. Let us suppose the story to be Jack the Giant Killer— 
not illustrated. It is generally better to let standard children dis- 
cover the subject-matter of their lessons themselves by reading the 
title, than to tell it them. When they have read it, in this instance, 
we might ask : 
“Have you ever heard of giants before? Were they plea- 
sant people to meet ? Would you care to meet one’? What were 
they like? Tell me some of the cruel things they used to do. 
Then people would not care to have giants living near them, would 
they? If one did, they would be quite glad to hear that he was 
killed, and be very thankful to the person who killed him. But 
would it be an easy matter to kill a giant—to be a giant-killer—if he
-P-A-G-E-130
The Teaching of Reading 117 
was so big and fierce and carried such heavy weapons? Then the 
Jack who killed the giant must have been somebody very big and 
brave? Let us read and find out.” 
[Before the end of the lesson it will be discovered that Jack was 
not big at all: but only cunning and brave and very determined to 
get rid of the giant because he was such a nuisance to everybody. 
Perhaps the notion of hero might be suggested and the word 
given.] 
Or let us suppose that we prefer to make our introduction through 
a picture illustrating the story to be read : 
We may first tell the children to look at the picture silently 
for two or three minutes and at the end of that time ask them to 
tell us what they have found in the picture. If it is a good one, 
and a good illustration, most of them will have discovered those 
parts of it which bear directly on the story, and will come pretty 
near the truth in their answers if we ask them what they suppose 
the story is about. If they have missed the point of the picture 
we should try to direct them to it. If, for instance, the picture is of 
Cinderella before her godmother’s visit and they describe her as a 
girl with a brush, we may ask where she is sitting. What are 
found in fireplaces? We may, then, tell them that this poor 
girl—“ Look at her ragged clothes and her sad face ”’—having 
always to sit by herself in the kitchen, used to draw up her stool 
to the fireplace and sit with her fect among the cinders. For this 
she was called—‘ We will find out by whom as we read ”—-Cinder- 
ella. ‘ We will find out, too, why she had to sit in the kitchen.” 
There must always be, in our picture introductions, this drawing 
away of the mind from the picture to the story which is to satisfy 
it still further. The picture, indeed, is in itself an intelligent 
introduction to the story—arousing interest, as ours must do, 
without satisfying it. That is the work of the story itself. 
On the other hand, if the reading matter is a chapter of a con- 
tinued story—and continued stories that carry the interest forward 
from day to day are growing in favour—the best introduction is a. 
revision of the story as far as it has beenread. It should, however, 
go a little farther and prepare the children for the happenings in 
the chapter for the day, showing how what has gone before neces- 
sarily leads up to what is coming—this again, of course, without
-P-A-G-E-131
118 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
exhausting the interest that is to hold the children’s attention as 
they read. 
We shall need to remember always that introductions must be 
brief. Five minutes is the very most that we can afford to give to 
them. 
The actual reading should follow, We should set the children 
to read silently a part—not usually less than a fair-sized paragraph 
—of the lesson. This is necessary in order that they may master 
both the words and the meaning of the passage before being called 
upon to read it aloud. It is better to prevent a bad habit than to 
cure it,and many children get into the habit of stumbling over words 
and reading inexpressively, because in their earliest reading lessons 
they have been required to read aloud passages which they have 
not had a chance of looking through | beforehand. We cannot expect 
lower standard children to read a piece well at sight. Many of the 
words met with in their standard readers even, are still too un- 
familiar for them to be able to gather their meaning quickly enough 
to render it justly, Unseen reading is a useful test to give to upper 
standard children occasionally, but even they should, as a rule, 
read aloud only after a preliminary study of the matter. 
At the end of their silent reading of a passage our pupils should 
be able to give the substance of it at first in answer to questions 
but, later, continuously. While this task of gathering ideas from 
the printed page is new to them, we may help them by telling them 
beforehand what we wish them to find out or by asking one or two 
questions to be answered when they have read through the piece 
set. During or at the end of their silent reading, we should 
allow the children to ask the pronunciation of any words they 
do not know or the meaning of any phrase they cannot under- 
stand. This will remove difficulties before the reading aloud 
begins. : 
The reading aloud, as has been said, should almost invariably 
be by individuals and not by the class—or group—as a whole. We 
should not interrupt any child to make corrections, for the main 
effect of doing so will be to take his thoughts off the reading and so 
to lessen his chance of dealing justly with either the sound or the 
sense. Interrupted reading, very generally speaking, grows worse 
and worse as the reader proceeds. Errors should be noted a8 they 
occur and dealt with when the end of the passage is reached. .An- 
other reason for adopting this plan lies in the greater likelihood of
-P-A-G-E-132
The Teaching of Reading 119 
our gaining the attention of the whole of the class to the corrections 
made. : 
The mistakes made will fall into two groups—mistakes in saying 
the words and mistakes in giving the meaning. It is better to deal 
with the latter first ; for when the meaning’ is grasped other mis- 
takes tend to disappear. It is the mental act of reading—the 
gathering of ideas from the printed page, that should be brought 
into the foreground of our pupils’ thoughts, for it is the power of 
doing this that we wish above all to cultivate. When we realise 
from a child’s reading that he has mistaken the meaning of the 
passage, our first care must be to set him right. We may be able 
to do so by means of a question or two ; we may need to appeal to 
the class for help, as, for instance, through another rendering ; we 
may be reduced to telling the meaning, but this we should not do 
till other means have failed. When the reader sees the meaning 
clearly in the new light furnished, he should be told to read the 
passage again. 
We may correct mistakes in pronunciation ourselves or may ask 
other pupils to do so. While the reading is in progress it will be 
enough for the child who has mispronounced a word to say it again 
correctly and then to read it in the phrase in whichit occurs. But 
we should note the frequency with which any one error occurs, and at 
the end of the lesson or at the beginning of a subsequent one, should 
base a pronunciation drill upon those which are found to be common. 
It is the practice in some schools to urge the pupils to be on the 
watch for mistakes in the reading of their class-fellows. It is 
doubtful whether this is likely to have a good effect on the natures 
of the children, and it is certain that it has a bad one on their read- 
ing. Being constantly on the look-out for faults in their neighbours’ 
reading, they lose sight of what is of more importance—-the mean- 
ing of the piece read, more especially since the faults they find are 
almost always slips or mispronunciations. Errors of expression 
usually pass unnoticed. 
In dealing with slips we must discriminate between those which 
are made by even good readers from time to time, those which are 
due tonervousness, and those which areunmistakeably careless. The 
first may be disregarded. To correct the second we must try to 
put the reader at his ease. In the case of the third we shall be justi- 
fied in requiring the offender to read again after the class has been. 
dismissed.
-P-A-G-E-133
120 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
From the very beginning expressiveness in reading must be 
cultivated. “Expression” is not a thing to be postponed until 
our pupils have reached a certain point in the mastering of mechani- 
cal difficulties. The very first sentence they read must be uttered 
expressively ; and it will be if they understand and have some 
interest in expressing it. The word-by-word sounding which is so 
often heard in Sub-Standard classes is not reading and should not 
be allowed from reading books, Whatever is necessary in the way 
of preliminary work to enable our pupils to grasp and render the 
meaning of a whole phrase at a time, should be done in the form of 
blackboard exercises before reading books are given tothem. There 
is no need that the phrases should he long ones. Many single 
words form, the subject being understood, a sentence by themselves, 
and the children can learn to read them—not simply to sound them, 
that is, but to give them expression as they look at their printed 
forms. Thus the word “Sit”? may be read, and later other words 
may be added and expression change with each addition: ‘ Sit 
down,” “TY will sit down.” What we must jead the childrén to see 
is that in reading it is not the word but the thought that is the unit 
of expression. 
When we all discover—as we may do by listening to the speech 
of children whenever they are giving unstudied expression to their 
feelings—how little need they have to be taught to render expres- 
sively any sentiment they understand and feel, the method of trying 
to secure just expression in class reading will be altered. Rules 
and the patterning of short phrases will be given up and the fur- 
nishing of reading matter that they can understand and enjoy will 
take their place. This done, the problem of how to secure expres- 
sive reading is almost solved ; for there is no need “to set about 
teaching a child how to inflect his voice when he pities a dead robin, 
or when he exclaims at a flash of lightning, or shudders or claps his 
hands over the thunder.” He knows how quite as well as we do ; 
and he is able, through the intensity of his young feelings and the 
flexibility of his young voice, to do it much better. 
What will still be necessary, however, is to create, or to keep 
alive, when, more happily, it exists, a keen feeling of the pleasure 
that is to be gained from the reading of books. The tales told to 
Sub-Standard classes were told with this as one of the ends in view ; 
and children who, as infants, have felt the spell of the story-weaver 
will generally turn gladly to books. Even in these cases, however,
-P-A-G-E-134

EE The Teaching of Reading 121 
there is much, where a number of children are gathered together, 
to tempt their eyes and their thoughts from the printed page ; 
and without attention there cannot be understanding or, without 
understanding, enjoyment. We shall need the power to keep the 
attention of our pupils on what they read until they reach the point 
at which the reading itself enchains it. This will be much sooner 
in the case of books—and there are many of them published now- 
adays--which make a real appeal to the known interests of chil- 
dren. The old infant primer failed through its attempt to employ 
short regular words ; the old standard reader failed through being 
too informative. What is wanted in school books is matter that 
the children will really enjoy ; and this must be borne in mind in 
choosing them. During their reading they must be able to escape 
on the wings of words with their underlying meanings from the dry 
matter-of-fact world of dull “lessons ” into the realm of fancy and 
feeling. 
This points to the place for pattern reading. It has been sug- 
gested that the patterning of each short phrase of the lesson for the 
unthinking mimicry of the class, must be given up in the interests 
of real expressiveness. Our model, however, may and should be 
one of the surest aids of our pupils in their efforts to render sound 
and sense perfectly, It will never be more fittingly employed than 
in reading with.smoothness and ease, pleasant intonation and due 
emphasis, one of the tales of old delight that set fancy free ; or in 
giving fervent expression to some poem that wakes a sleeping emo- 
tion. It is for such uses as these that it must be reserved. 
We come now to the last stage of the lesson—the questioning 
which closes it. The purpose of this questioning is not primarily 
to discover whether the children have been attending. It has a 
more important aim—the quickening of their intelligent apprecia- 
tion of what has been read. Throughout the lesson they should 
have been permitted—more than that, encouraged—to ask what 
questions they would. At the close of the lesson comes our turn 
to question. It would be strange, indeed, if we saw in the matter 
read no more than the children are able to see ; and the aim of our 
questioning should be to suggest new ideas and new reasons for 
enjoyment. There should be also, even at this early stage, an 
attempt to induce a critical tendency in the children, although 
at first it will not go much further than deciding which parts of the 
story they like best and whether they have enjoyed it as much as
-P-A-G-E-135
122 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
others read previously. The supporting of their choice by reasons 
is an exercise for older children, but it is one to which all early 
lessons should lead up. 
Lessons to upper standard children must undergo some modi- 
fication in view of the fact that these pupils have made consider- 
able headway against the mechanical difficulties of learning to 
read. Reading aloud should give place more and more to silent 
reading ; and additional practice in what will be their usual form of 
reading and their chief means of education on leaving school be 
given in connection with other subjects of the school curriculum. 
In history, in nature study and in geography there should be 
fewer oral lessons and more private reading. 
Less time should be spent over pronunciation drills, though these 
should not be give up entirely. Distinctness and purity of utter- 
ance are every whit as essential ; no amount of light and shade in 
expression can be made to do duty for them. Clearness is the very 
foundation of all good reading and all higher qualities must be built 
on it. But the four years in which reading aloud has been a daily 
exercise should have gone a long way towards mastering faults 
of articulation, and the intellectual side of reading should begin to 
engage attention to a greater and greater extent. Our pupils’ intel- 
lectual grasp of any matter read must find expression throughcertain 
devices for conveying meaning and emotion—modulation, emphasis, 
pace, pause, and gesture—and it is the right use of these that must 
chiefly engage attention during upper standard reading lessons. 
Gesture need not detain us; in reading it is almost negligible, 
though sometimes we may see a child’s dramatic sense express 
itself by this means—in a movement of the hand or head or some 
feature of the face—as he gathers and translates thought from the 
printed page. 
In the matter of modulation—the rising and falling of the voice 
in pitch—children, as has been said, through the greater flexibility 
of their voices, have very much the advantage of us. Theirs is 
the time of life when the voice “is particularly sweet, pathetic, 
and convincing”-—the natural voice, that is. Unhappily, a 
variety of causes—nervousness, shyness, sullenness, passion, 
boredom—frequently combine, even during infancy, to muffle 
the naturally beautiful child tones. If, however, our’ pupils come 
to us-young, we may do much to recover for them the tones and: 
inflections they have lost. 
But this is all we must attempt—to help them to recover the
-P-A-G-E-136
The Teaching of Reading 123 
natural flexibility of their voices and their responsiveness to 
feeling. Any hint of artificiality resulting from attention to rules 
is worse than the monotony we wish to vary. What we attempt, 
therefore, must not be done so much directly in connection with 
any particular passage to be read, as indirectly through vocal 
drill on the one side and, on the other, the cultivation of sympa- 
thetic understanding and emotion, 
The flexibility which is necessary for easy modulation should 
have been under cultivation from the time that systematic speech 
practice began in the lowest class. Changes of pitch in the speaking 
voice—a spoken modulator practice—should be required in the 
saying of chosen sentences, The younger the children, the less 
will be the difficulty, as a rule, in securing these; but in Sub- 
Standard classes we should put fun into the practice. This will be 
very easy, for example, in connection with the story of “ Golden 
Hair and the Three Bears.” ‘The children will be delighted to 
imitate the deep growl of the Big Bear and the high squeak of 
the Little Bear, but will return with relief to the natural pitch of 
the Middle Bear’s voice, which level their own voices should keep 
during the greater part of their speech and reading, For the lower 
standards we might choose some one particular sentence for this 
modulator practice, taking for example the line: “ Roll on, thou 
deep and dark blue ocean, roll,” and requiring the children, as 
one exercise, to begin on a very low note and rise tone by tone 
to a fairly high one on the last word. As another exercise, we 
might tell them to begin on a high note and drop tone by tone to 
alow one. At first the exercises should be taken slowly, but speed 
should be increased later, and the exercises varied in the attempt 
to get the children’s voices to move easily and rapidly from tone 
to tone. We might get our Pupils , too, to see the use of a change 
of pitch in expressing meaning from examples such as “You were 
there” and “ You were there ? ?” in which the question is indi- 
cated simply by the rising inflection at the end. It is in this way 
that we shall make the best preparation for the modulation which 
should be looked for in the reading of upper standard children. 
We should never give our pupils instructions beforehand to 
“ change their voices nicely”’ in reading. When they have read 
we may, if necessary, tell them that they don’t “seem to mean” 
what they have been reading, and by questioning help them to see 
why their rendering was faulty. But lower standard children are 
not capable of entering very far into the feelings of other people,
-P-A-G-E-137
124 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
and our best work will be done by cultivating their own feelings— 
using, for the purpose, not their stories and verses only, but also 
daily happenings which come within their own experience or which 
we may think it advisable to bring to their notice. All generous 
and compassionate feelings which are within the range of their 
emotions should be cultivated. Modulation will follow, but for 
the time being it will be modulation of the speaking voice, and 
for the time being we must be content with that. 
Upper standard children are very much better able to enter 
into the feelings of other people and very much more interested 
in doing so. From the age of thirteen or so they will have little 
difficulty in appreciating such emotions as they are called upon 
to express. They must be helped, however, to realise the cir- 
cumstances that gave rise to such emotions. The means that 
offers is conversation. By talking over before the reading begins 
any situation which it depicts, we can help them to see and feel, 
and so enable them to express an emotion as if it were their own. 
Reading under these conditions is not likely, where vocal drill has 
made modulation easy, to lack this form of expression. 
Children use. emphasis so freely in their own speech, and hear 
it so frequently in that of others, that we shall have little need to 
point out to them its importance as a means of expression. At 
the same time, faults in emphasis will be common in their reading, 
and we shall need to deal with them. We shall be wise, however, 
to wait for the occurrence of faults and then to show in what respect 
the emphasis is faulty, rather than to attempt to give rules be- 
forehand. As in the case of modulation, what is wanted is that 
our pupils gain a real insight into the passage they are trying to 
express ; and, seeing or feeling with the author, give the emphasis 
required to bring out his meaning. Again, therefore, conversation 
about the piece to be read and a discussion of the rendering given, 
will be our best means of helping them to give due emphasis in 
reading. 
The form of emphasis most commonly used is that of putting 
a greater degree of force on the words it is desired to emphasize. 
The fact that emphasis may be given by reading certain phrases 
more slowly and placing a slight emphasis on each word may 
need pointing out to our pupils. Another way of emphasizing 
that they are probably even less familiar with, is that of saying more 
softly the words to be emphasized.
-P-A-G-E-138

| The Teaching of Reading 125 
The difference between accent and emphasis should be shown. 
Accent is a fixed, mechanical stress given to syllables and placed 
always on the same syllable in any given word. Emphasis, on the 
other hand, is given to words, and as the placing of it is ruled entirely 
by the meaning the sentence is meant to convey, intelligence must 
be brought to bear on the act. The placing of accent has to do with 
pronunciation ; the placing of emphasis, with expression. 
Pace, or rate of speed, must geherally be slow in reading in 
order that utterance may be distinct. It has a value also as a 
form of emphasis and, therefore, as a part of expression. But, 
whatever the necessity for emphasis, the rate of speed in reading 
must never be increased beyond the point at which it is possible to 
sound every syllable distinctly. A sufficiently slow rate of speed 
is one of the essential qualities of good reading difficult to obtain 
from school children. Some of them gabble through sheer nervous- 
ness, some from slovenliness of utterance, and some again because 
they make the mistake of confusing quick reading with fluent 
reading and fancy that, by racing ahead, they are proving what good 
readers they are. Whatever the cause of their hurrying we must 
check it until every word that they utter is distinct. 
More important than any other device to make reading intellig- 
ible is phrasing. In recognition of this, pauses for punctuation are, 
as a rule, so carefully indicated by writers that their observance by 
readers tends to become mechanical. While for ordinary reading 
practice the writer’s punctuation may usefully serve as a guide, 
we should guard our pupils from the absurdity of “ stopping at a 
comma and saying One,” with no thought at all for the reason. 
This we may do by writing on the blackboard from time to time a 
fairly long paragraph, or the verse of a poem, without entering any 
punctuation marks, and inviting the children to decide for them- 
selves where the pauses should come. To help them we may, con- 
trary to our usual practice, give them a rule beforehand: Stop 
when you see a picture. They will have little difficulty, then, in 
deciding where to pause in such a passage as, for example, the first 
verse of Longfellow’s poem, The Slave’s Dream : 
“ Beside the ungathered rice | he lay | 
His sickle in his hand || 
His breast was bare | his matted hair | 
Was buried in the sand |ll 
Again | in the mist and shadow of sleep.| 
He saw I his native land.”
-P-A-G-E-139
126 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
If, as our pupils’ give us the successive phrases, we mark them 
off by vertical lines we shall be able afterwards to discuss the length 
of the pauses, and being told that it should vary, indicate this by 
doubling, or even trebling, certain of the division lines. Further 
discussion should make clear that the reason for the variation lies 
in the fact that the different pictures are not linked together with 
equal closeness. The first two lines draw pictures in bold outline ; 
the next two add detail. A pause is natural before we turn from 
the prone figure of the reaper sickle in hand, to note the more de- 
tailed drawing of the succeeding pictures. The change from what 
we see to what the slave sees occasions another pause, the longest, 
at sand.” The foregoing pictures are very loosely connected with the 
following ones. : 
Some special points should be noticed. Difference of opinion 
may be felt by.the children as to the number and length of the 
pauses. Some children may feel that the first picture is not com- 
pleted until the figure of the reaper is seen on the ground ; others 
may think that the plantation of ungathered rice constitutes a 
picture in itself. Again, to some it will seem that where the sub- 
ject of the fourth sentence ends the third line the voice should be 
hurried forward without pause, while others hold that the end of 
every line in poetry should be marked by a pause, though it will be 
barely perceptible where the meaning reaches forward. These 
various opinions should be discussed ; not with the idea of ‘‘ quash- 
ing ” any ; but for the interest of the discussion and in the interests 
of expression. Different renderings of poems read or learnt in 
class are to be encouraged, for hard and fast rules make for mechani- 
cal practice. While almost all the children will feel the neces- 
sity for a pause after Again, they may not see the reason in the 
light of the rule given, for the word raises no picture before 
the mind’s eye. It must be pointed out that it creates a separate 
mental impression, and must therefore be marked off. The fact 
that the pause after saw is a pause for the sake of emphasis 
should be noted. 
Occasional class practice of this sort will lead to intelligent 
phrasing which shows clear understanding of the construction of 
any piece read. 
Upper standard reading lessons should not invariably close 
with questioning, and even when they do, care should be taken to 
keep the questions free from any tendency to degenerate into mere
-P-A-G-E-140
The Teaching of Reading 127 
examining. Throughout the reading our aim should have been to 
wake a sense of companionship in a pleasurable exercise ; and this 
effect should not be spoiled at the end. A discussion of the piece 
read, an inviting of free expressions of opinion on it, the connecting 
of it with some other with which it has points of similarity or con- 
trast, the reading of another piece which it recalls, an attempt to 
arouse interest in its author—any one of these may be made to 
close the lesson in a way that makes the children look forward with 
eager pleasure to the time of the next lesson. In any discussion of 
a passage following on the reading of it, the need to develop, and 
at the same time direct, our pupils’ critical powers should be borne 
in mind. The ability to discriminate between what is good, what 
is mediocre, and what is bad, and the wisdom to choose the good 
in literature depend on critical power, and the main purpose of 
our reading lessons is unfulfilled if our pupils have it not before they 
leave school for good. 
There is one branch of reading which should be practised in 
‘schools, and especially in upper standard classes, much more than 
it is—the reading of poetry. Most standard readers contain pieces 
of poetry, and of late years these have improved in quality so that 
they will generally be found to repay a close study and a careful 
rendering. Yet they are generally treated unjustly in one of two 
ways. Either they are neglected or they are read without any 
more preparation being given to them than is given to a prose pas- 
sage. The reading of poetry should not be neglected, because poetry 
is the highest form of the writer’s art, and itis our business to acquaint 
our pupils with “the best ” that is attainable in every branch of 
their work. It should not be attempted without the most careful 
preparation, because in the absence of such preparation the poem 
is not read ; it is murdered. 
It has been very well said that “the business of appreciating 
the inmost spirit of the greatest verse is tremendous and lifelong.” 
So much the more reason for beginning it early. While, therefore, 
verse-reading is an exercise specially suited to upper standard 
classes, Standard II is not too early to make a start. There is 
another reason for beginning early. We teach—or should teach— 
reading as “a pastime and a happiness”; and once a reader 
has accustomed himself to verse, it will make a more pleasurable 
pastime and give a keener happiness than the reading of the finest 
prose.
-P-A-G-E-141
128 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
If “the business of appreciating the inmost spirit of the 
greatest verse is tremendous and lifelong,” we shall find our 
powers sufficiently tasked in learning to render and teaching our 
pupils to render any poem of merit. Very sound and practical 
suggestions that may help us in the necessary preliminary of 
learning to like poetry are made in the chapter on Verse in 
Arnold Bennett’s Literary Taste—and how to form it. They should 
be studied. 
Then, when we turn to the task of teaching, we should remember 
that it is more important that our pupils should love and be moved 
by poetry, than that they should be very learned concerning it, for : 
“God sent His Singers upon earth 
With songs of sadness and of mirth, 
That they might fouch the hearts of men.” 
The poems we should choose for reading, then, are those which 
make their appeal through a sense of rhythm, harmony, and 
beauty, to the emotions rather than to the intelligence. 
The steps in a recitation lesson are the same as those in a read- 
ing lesson. A passage for recitation demands fuller treatment ; 
but it is treatment on similar lines. There is, of course, one new 
difficulty—the learning of the words “by heart.” Let us now 
consider the steps in the lesson in turn. 
Preparation for the lesson should generally take the form of a 
short discussion on the title. During this, knowing the nature— 
merry or tender or stirring or sad—of the poem or passage to be| 
learnt, we should try to bring our pupils into sympathy with it, 
striking, as it were, the keynote with which they must be in tune 
before they can render the sentiment properly. We should then 
read—or, better, say—the whole recitation as clearly and ex- 
pressively as we can. At the close of this reading we should sec 
that our listeners have grasped the meaning of the whole passage 
and of particular phrases. After this, a blackboard on which th 
portion of the recitation for the day’s lesson has been writt 
without punctuation marks, should be turned towards the children. 
Books containing the recitation are desirable, but the use of the: 
should be postponed until punctuation marks, decided upon by 
teacher and class together, have been entered. 
The children should next be told to read through the vers: 
               
     
   
   
-P-A-G-E-142
Ne The Teaching of Reading 129 
or other portion—on the blackboard, slowly. During this first 
reading, attention should be given mainly to securing accuracy 
of pronunciation, that is, to hearing that the consonants are distinct 
and the vowels pure. 
When pronunciation is satisfactory we should go through the 
passage with the children for the purpose of discovering where 
pauses should be made and emphasis placed. Further oppor- 
tunity of rendering the meaning clear will occur while this is being 
done. 
The children should have had practice during reading lessons 
in phrasing according to the mind pictures raised by printed words, 
Vertical lines may be used to separate these, and they should at 
this point, be entered in the passage on the board. 
When phrasing or emphasis is wrong, the children should not 
merely be told so, but should be shown why. 
Various devices may be used for indicating emphasis. Accent 
marks form a simple and satisfactory one. Being small they 
do not interfere with the look of the passage; and they can 
easily be increased to show that a greater degree of emphasis is 
required. 
The securing of suitable modulation must be our next concern. 
As has been said earlier, conversation which brings out meaning 
and stirs feeling will be most effective in this. 
The rise and fall of the voice, which is one means of expression, 
may be graphically represented for the children by re-writing the 
words of the passage higher and lower like sol-fa syllables on a 
modulator. 
In older classes the metre should receive considerable attention, 
but little should be attempted in this matter in the lower standards. 
Still, even young children can realise that the stress falls regularly 
in poetry. While short and long vowel sounds may represent 
graphically the weak and strong accents, the use of them should 
be postponed till the higher standards are reached. It will be 
quite enough for the children in the lower standards to tap strongly 
and weakly for the accents with two fingers. Accent and emphasis 
are often opposed to each other in poetry. Neither must be allowed 
to destroy the other. Any tendency to sing-song intonation— 
up and down, up and down—must be checked. 
After this, it will be time to get the children (individually, nor 
simultaneously) to combine all their foregoing efforts in an attempt 
I
-P-A-G-E-143
130 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
to render the passage justly. Jerkiness of utterance must be stopped 
and a smooth flow of the words obtained. Full musical tone is 
secured by opening and rounding the mouth, and dwelling on the 
vowel sounds. At each step opportunities for making the meaning 
clearer will have occurred, and sound and sense should now be 
linked up in a way that brings home to the children the full 
meaning of the passage, and enables them to convey it to their 
hearers, 
There remains still the memorising of the words. As will be 
seen, however, the passage has been read through six or seven 
times in the course of the suggested treatment. Moreover the words 
of good poetry require little memorising—“ almost singing them- 
selves they run ”—and there will only be one or two children who 
have not got them “ by heart” without any effort of mechanical 
memorising. At this point the relational words in the passage 
should be erased, the notional ones being left a little longer to 
suggest the full text. After two or three more—individual— 
repetitions some of the notional words should be erased, leaving only 
the chief or “key” words. Finally these, too, should be erased 
and volunteers should be asked to come out and recite the whole 
passage to the class. 
The same steps may be taken with advantage during the 
reading of poetry, though the last one of course is unneces- 
sary. 
Tt will not be possible to treat more than four or eight lines of 
poetry so fully as is suggested above in the course of a half-hour’s 
lesson. Still at this rate a poem of from twelve to twenty-four 
lines could be mastered in less than a month, so that twelve such 
poems could be learnt in a year. We should not be satisfied if 
much less than that is accomplished. Syllabus requirements 
demand a minimum, and children are certainly capable of learning 
much more than the amount set, which is insufficient to create a 
taste for learning by heart good poetry or prose. . 
The value of such a systematic treatment of a passage for 
recitation goes beyond the actual improvement in delivery. Half 
unconsciously our pupils will begin to realise during their progress 
through the standards that in voice and language they possess an 
instrument of rare beauty and power. They will then think it 
worth while to take trouble over a piece of reading or recitation, 
and thus find in it more than they had suspected. With the
-P-A-G-E-144
The Teaching of Reading 131 
gaining of the ability to appreciate beautiful poetry and fine prose, 
they make a real advance in education. 
The almost invariable choice of poetry for recitation, to’ the 
exclusion of prose, is to be regretted. There are many prose 
selections suitable for the purpose, and we should use them to make 
our pupils acquainted with the qualities of good prose. For the 
lower standards many of the well-known fables, dealing as they 
so often do with animal nature which is always interesting to 
children, will be found suitable. 
It may be well to say a word or two about the kinds of reading 
book most suitable for the different standards. The reader for 
Standard I should contain a good proportion of fairy-tales, to- 
gether with some of the legends of Greece, Rome, and the Norse- 
land, and descriptions of things in nature. Supplementary readers 
may be chosen from among the many excellent series published 
of late years. As most of them are quite cheap, it should not be® 
impossible to obtain class copies of two or three of them for use 
during the year. 
Fairy-tales, legends, and nature stories are suitable for Standard 
II also ; but to these should be added a collection of stories from 
history and another of descriptions of far-off lands and their people. 
Supplementary readers should be provided as for Standard I, and 
a poetry reader should be introduced. 
In Standard III one of the readers should be a continuous story. 
A school edition of Alice in Wonderland or The Water Babies would 
be very suitable. A more advanced book of history stories or one 
of the new geographical readers—both, if possible—should be pro- 
vided. The use of the poetry reader begun in Standard JI should 
be continued. 
For Standards IV and V the literary reader might be a school 
edition of some classic in which there are child characters. There 
should be in use also a historical and a geographical reader. 
Care should be given at the time of choosing to seeing that they 
are well written. A poetry reader will also be needed. 
As in Standards VI and VII reading and recitation merge 
into the study of literature several readers are necessary. A. 
collection of short biographies will be useful for reading about 
the lives of the writers of the prose or poetical pieces chosen for 
study. 
In selecting poetry for these standards, the choice should fall
-P-A-G-E-145
132 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
upon such as require a special exposition of the main idea. In 
the earlier standards it will have sufficed if the poems chosen for 
reading and recitation have given the pupils some appreciation of 
the beauties of language and of the uses to which it can be‘put in 
awakening emotion. But when the years of childhood are past, 
the mind needs other training. It is essential that critical power 
shall be exercised, and wisely exercised, to prevent its becoming 
a merely destructive faculty that finds its pleasure in deriding 
and decrying all that it finds itself unable to appreciate. 
’ In providing this training an effort should be made so to grade 
the literature course that our pupils make a gradual ascent of the 
hill of difficulty, being provided in successive lessons with successive 
definite points of literary style and device for criticism and apprecia- 
tion. Thus, for example, pieces of narrative prose or poetry 
might be followed by others of descriptive matter and later by some 
“which are reflective in character. 
Another leading feature of the more systematic work of thesé 
standards should be the attempt to make the course representative 
of as many forms of literature as possible—thus the selections of 
poetry should number among them examples of epic, lyric and 
dramatic work, while in prose reading the pupils should be made 
acquainted not only with the novel and the essay but also with 
biography and history. 
‘With regard to the various forms of prose literature, the readers 
for the two years might be chosen with a view to familiarising the 
pupils with them. Thus in Standard VI a school edition of one of 
Dickens’ novels might be read, with a biography of some favourite 
author or historical character, while on the poetical side descrip- 
tive and lyrical poetry might be dealt with. The following yeara 
collection of essays, and selections from some standard historian— 
Gibbon, Hume, Macaulay, Motley—might succeed them, epic and 
dramatic poetry being taken on the poetical side. 
In both standards the use of illustrative material should be 
increased, and we should set ourselves to fill portfolios with such 
pictures, portraits, literary facsimiles and documents as we can 
secure, The value of contemporary documents—-letters, diaries, 
&c.—for purposes of illustrating should not be overlooked. - 
Some suggestions as to suitable readers for the upper standards 
may be gathered from the foregoing pages. For supplementary, 
readers the later books of the series recommended for the lower
-P-A-G-E-146
rr 
EE The Teaching of Reading 133 
standards should be obtained. These contain extracts from or 
abridgments of the novels of standard authors. Prose versions 
of some of Shakespeare’s plays should also be read, and in Standard 
VII, at least, one of the plays in its dramatic form. 
It is not essential that there should be a copy of all these books 
for each child. A single library copy will be sufficient ; for, when 
children can read with fair ease, fluency and expression, and with- 
out stumbling—-as they should certainly be able to do in Standard 
Vi—it is not only unnecessary that the members of the class 
should each hold a copy of the reading-book in front of them during 
lessons, but a positive advantage when they do not do so. The 
reader then feels the need of making himself heard, as he does not 
do when he knows that his listeners have a copy of the book in 
their hands ; and the listeners are better able to fix their thoughts 
on what is being read than when they are following the words. 
All schools should have a good library for the use of their pupils ; 
and this should not be a lending library merely, from which the 
children may take, or forget to take, a book home on Friday after- 
noons, It should be open every day for purposes of reference 
and for private reading in school. Where the size of the school 
admits of it, it is well to have a certain number of the library books 
apportioned as class libraries to which the members of the different 
classes have easier access. It is important, too, that the librarian 
should be an enthusiast, as this increases the number not only of 
books lent but also of books read and enjoyed. In larger schools 
a member of the staff should be made librarian or, perhaps, librarian- 
in-chief with an assistant chosen from among the scholars ; but in 
single-teacher schools the busy “‘ Head ” may well be glad to entrust 
to two of the pupils the work of lending books and recording loans. 
It is only from familiarity with books that love of them springs, and 
to teach our pupils to love good books is one of the first duties we 
owe them. “A little library growing larger every year is an 
honourable part of [a school’s] history. It is [its] duty to have 
books. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessaries 
of [school] life.”

CHAPTER VI 
A. THE TEACHING OF WRITING 
**°T say, Daddy, it’s an awful nuisance that you and I don’t know how 
to write, isn’t it? If we did we could send a message for the new spear.’ 
“«* Taffy,’ said Tegumai, ‘how often have I told you not to use slang? 
“ Awful” isn’t a pretty word,—but it would be a convenience, now you 
mention it, if we could write home.’” 
—The First Letter: “ Just So Stories,” RuDYARD KIPLING, 
«Writing should be to the child what it is in ordinary life to the adult, 
one of the ways of expressing thought and not a merely formal copy-book 
exercise.’’—H. THISELTON MARK. 
Very early in life children become familiarised with writing as a 
means of expressing and communicating thought. Letters come 
to the house from distant friends and are written to members of 
the household absent on a visit. This stirs the imitative instinct 
to exercise itself in a new direction, and a child of four or five 
will beg paper and pencil that he may write a letter. A little 
later he goes to school, where he is taught, among other things, 
to write. 
The foregoing suggests the purpose for which we teach writing. 
It is as a means of communicating thought in special circumstances 
that the subject must be regarded. The mechanical act of forming 
and combining symbols must never be looked upon as an end in 
itself. 
Yet that the early mechanical stage of instruction in writing is 
important, is made clear by a glance at the “ letter ” of an untaught 
child. The maze of scribbles covering the page is unintelligible. 
As writing fails of its purpose if what is written cannot be read, a 
preliminary stage of instruction and mechanical effort is necessary 
that the symbols used in writing may be taught and learnt. If, 
535 :
-P-A-G-E-149
136 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
however, we keep in our minds the memory of the eager little 
“letter-writer”? who, possessing his thought or feeling, fancies 
that he needs only paper and pencil for the expressing of it, we shall 
not keep him longer than needful forming elements, letters, or 
even words and sentences that have nothing to do with self-expres- 
sion. There is no reason why he should be kept from enjoying the 
fruits of his endeavours until he reaches the standard in which 
written composition is first demanded by the elementary school 
course. Yet that is commonly done. The mechanical stage of 
writing is regarded as a separate subject and far too much import- 
ance is attached to mechanical perfection—during the half-hours 
given to copy-writing, that is. On the other hand, when it is being 
used instrumentally—during dictation and other test-writing— 
neatness and legibility tend to disappear ; not so much sacrificed 
to speed, as felt by the writer not to be demanded by the exercise. 
Yet the whole purpose of his practice in the mechanical art of writ- 
ing is to secure these two qualities in conjunction with speed, so 
that, when he wishes to use writing as a means of expression, he 
may be able to produce quickly a “ hand ” that is easy to read and 
does not distract and annoy the reader by its blemishes and blunders. 
It cannot be too strongly emphasized that the production of perfect 
handwriting is not an end in itself. We do not want to paper walls 
with our specimens, nor to have them framed to take the place of 
pictures. We wish to give our pupils a new means of thought 
expression. Regarding writing, thus, as an instrumental art, we 
must at all times keep in view the forming of the children’s ordinary 
running hand and endeavour to combine in it the three necessary 
qualities of legibility, neatness, and speed. In endeavouring to do 
this, we must bear in mind that there are, in learning to write, two 
distinct processes—the muscular act of learning to hold and con- 
trol whatever instruments are used, and the mental effort of learning 
to recognise, form, and remember the symbols, As in all else, 
following nature’s way, we must see that the muscle work precedes 
the mind work. 
Formal lessons in writing should come fairly late in the infant 
school, but easy printed letter forms—in sand and with chalk or 
crayon—may be attempted among other forms by the youngest 
children during drawing practice. With the printed forms, which 
are written singly, there will be no need to insist on the letters 
being begun at any particular point, as is necessary later for the
-P-A-G-E-150
The Teaching of Writing 137 
formation of a running script; and the children gain a useful 
familiarity with the forms without undue strain. At this stage the 
use of materials will be helpful in training muscular skill. Suitable 
materials at first are either the solid or outline forms of triangles, 
squares and other geometrical figures, to be followed later by letter 
forms made in cardboard, wood, or metal. The following account 
is one written of a school (Dr. Maria Montessori’s “ Casa dei Bam- 
bini” in Rome) in which children use such materials with results 
that prove their usefulness : 
“The child traces the outline of these and is then given a 
coloured pencil of large size to fill them in. No directions as to 
manner of holding the pencil or of making the marks are given to 
the child. His movements are left free and unconstrained. At 
first, naturally, the filling is irregular, often exceeding the outline 
or failing to touch it at every point, but the children enjoy playing 
with these coloured forms and gradually the strokes become even 
and the space is accurately filled in, When this happens the child 
is ready for the next step, but a week is usually allowed to elapse 
before it is taken. Script letters of large size cut from fine emery 
paper are pasted upon squares of cardboard, the vowels being 
light-coloured on a dark background and the consonants dark on 
a light background. . . . The child is given a letter, a vowel first, 
and told to touch it. Being already expert in this sort of exercise 
he usually does it-correctly ; but if need be the teacher takes his 
hand and directs the first and the middle fingers properly about the 
form of the letter and at the same time says, ‘ This isa.’ . . . The 
child is usually interested in this and repeats it by himself, in some 
cases many times. The next step is to teach him to recognise the 
letter when he hears the sound corresponding to it, so the teacher 
says to him, ‘Give me a’ or whatever the letter is. And the 
third step, after the letter has been lying on the table for some 
minutes, is to test the memory and recognition, and the teacher 
asks the child, ‘What is this?’ . . . The vowels are usually 
taught first and the consonants next; but there is no established 
order, as often the interest of the child in certain words or letters 
will determine the progress. . . . Besides the individual letters, 
words are given in the same way. For instance, the word mano. 
The teacher says to the child, ‘Give me m,’ and so on with the 
other letters . . . finally pronouncing the word, the child tracing it
-P-A-G-E-151
138 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
with the fingers. . . . Some day, when the child has become familiar 
with the vowels and a part of the consonants, for it is not con- 
sidered always necessary that the entire alphabet should be learnt 
before he begins to write, he is given a piece of chalk and . . . sud- 
denly finds himself in possession of a new power... . For a 
few days this acquisition becomes an absorbing occupation. . . . 
No child is ever told that a letter is faulty ; but the practice in 
tracing the sandpaper letters with the fingers is kept up long after 
the children are able to write, and in fact they write more by 
muscular sense than by sight, and if a child is in doubt as to the 
next letter that he wants to write, instead of looking at the letter 
he runs his fingers over the cardboard model, so that tiuscular 
training is continued.” (The Montessori System, by Theodate 
L. Smith. Harper.) 
As soon, however, as children are introduced to speech symbols 
for reading, formal writing lessons should begin. At first these 
should be confined to the printed characters, the children being 
shown how to copy, in a subsequent writing lesson, some letter or 
letters which they have mastered as speech symbols in an earlier 
reading lesson. We must, however, remember in transcribing 
these from book to blackboard for the children to copy, that the 
printed characters will only be used by our pupils during the short 
time that they are learning to associate them with the script forms, 
and from the beginning we should modify them slightly to em- 
phasize the resemblance between the printed and written char- 
acters. 
Letter groups for writing are, of course, not the same as letter 
groups for reading—reading groups being classified on sound and 
writing groups on form. Consultation of different handbooks on 
the teaching of writing will show that difference of opinion exists, 
among teachers of the subject, as to the best classification of letter 
forms and, of course, the alphabet having been formed without 
any thought of the difficulty of teaching infants to write, we may 
expect to encounter irregularities which make a perfect classifica- 
tion impossible. Moreover the slight difference of form which 
letters take in different styles of writing as, for instance, the ‘‘ Vere 
Foster,” Longmans’ Copy Books for South Africa and “‘ Ramage’s 
Systematic,” affect this grouping. It is, therefore, better for us 
to make our own groups in accordance with the style of writing
-P-A-G-E-152
The Teaching of Writing 139 
we teach, or to take them from a special handbook advocating ‘it ; 
and it will be sufficient to indicate here the principles which 
should govern such grouping: . 
Every group of letters should have a common base-form, and 
there should be in one group as little variation from the base-form 
as is possible without unduly multiplying the number of groups. 
The base-forms should be taught in order of simplicity. We may 
now see how these two principles may be made to apply in the 
first letter-group. The simplest letter of the alphabet in form is the 
small letter A . It consists, as will be seen, of an initial 
straight link, a short downstroke, a bottom curve, and a final 
straight link, and is furnished with a dot above. These four 
elements, then, together make the base-form of the i-group of 
letters. Of them, small Lv consists of the same 
elements, but owing to its Jonger downstroke requires the initial 
straight link to be taken higher. A short cross stroke takes the 
place of the dot of the 7. Small UY has, after the 
downstroke of the 7, a bottom curve running into an upstroke 
followed by a second short downstroke and terminating like the z 
with a bottom curve and straight link. Small 4p and 
A capital NL and W are in- 
cluded in this group. The first introduces, in addition to the 
elements mentioned, a top curve; while the second finishes with 
a crotchet. The capital letters have these additional clements as 
well as their greater height to increase their difficulty. We should 
not, however, think it necessary to teach them all in a single lesson,
-P-A-G-E-153
140 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
but only to-teach them, with perhaps the exception of the capitals, 
before passing to other letters with a new base-form. 
Two other distinctive base-forms are the loop SJ under 
and upper, the latter being simply an inversion of the former and 
M0 In the loop-group may be included e (short) andlbhkjfyz YZ; 
in the o-group, oa dgq¢AC. It will now be seen how ill-advised 
it would be to attempt to teach the letters of a reading group in 
a single writing lesson. Let us take, for example, Group 1, includ- 
ing short vowel a with the consonants pb;id;ckqandg. There 
are in this reading group,,letters from no less than three writing 
groups: p and ¢ from the t-group, b and k from the loop-group, and 
adcqand g from the o-group. To set the children to copy so many 
different base-forms in one lesson would be to invite the result of 
having no one of them mastered. 
In deciding—if the decision is not made for us by some higher 
authority—what style of writing we will teach to our pupils, we 
should bear certain guiding principlesin mind. The most important 
are: (1) That each letter is made according to a fixed design 
which need only in exceptional cases be modified in order to form 
a junction with any other letter. (2) That this design be as simple 
as possible in order that children may not be discouraged in learn- 
ing the forms. (3) That needless multiplicity of design be avoided, 
that is to say, that when a good capital form may be made 
as in the case of a, c,% and w simply by enlarging the small 
forms, this should be done in preference to selecting an entirely 
new one. 
A favourite style of writing is that known as the Semi-Upright. 
In it, it is possible to combine easily legibility and speed. We can 
write more quickly when the letters slope forward a little (the 
correct slope is about 18° or 20°) than when they are quite upright. 
There is, moreover, less likelihood of the loops of one line entang- 
ling with the tails of the line above. Against these advantages it 
is urged that all writing that is not upright tends to induce a strain 
on the eyes ; as, in order to see that the slope is parallel, the head
-P-A-G-E-154
i 
ae The Teaching of Writing 141 
must be tilted into a position that exercises them unequally. It is, 
however, possible to keep a parallel slope when sitting square to 
the desk with the head bent slightly forward and downward— 
a position which is not injurious to eyesight. 
The system to be adopted having been chosen, it must be de- 
cided whether slates or paper, pencils or pens are to be used. Slates 
are still in use to a large extent in this country ; but it is to be hoped 
that before long paper will everywhere be substituted for them. 
To begin with, slates do a good deal to increase the noise and 
disorder of a class. Another objection to them is, that unless 
supervision is of the strictest, they are a positive encouragement 
to an uncleanly and unhealthy habit. From the point of view of 
work, the objections to them are as great. They lend themselves 
to easy erasing, thus encouraging carelessness; and they are seldom 
ruled well enough to permit of. really satisfactory work. Even 
where the lines are well ruled at first they often become invisible in 
a few weeks’ time, giving the owner an excuse for not guiding his 
writing by them ; while it is rarely that children’s pencils are suffi- 
ciently long and pointed for their purpose. Even when they are, 
the use of them is not a good preparation for holding a pen. 
It cannot be reasonably urged that slates are much cheaper than 
paper is. The initial cost of them is more than that of a good 
substantial exercise-book—which would last a considerable part of 
a year—and they are always liable to be broken by a fall. 
Throughout the Sub-Standards and Standard I lead pencils and 
not pens should be used. There is, however, a tendency to ex- 
aggerate the difficulty of writing with pens and keeping the paper 
free from smudges and blots. Quite young children can be taught 
to do both, and once all the letters and combinations of letters 
are mastered, the sooner theyjibegin to practise using the com- 
monest instrument for written communications in practical life, 
~ the better. 
We now approach the subject of actual teaching. The first 
thing to be emphasized is the need for us to be able to use the 
blackboard. The days are gone in which it was thought sufficient 
to put a perfect copy in front of the children and expect them to 
reproduce it. It is now recognised that children must be taught 
writing; and that the best results are obtained when the copy is 
written in front of the class. All manner of faults may be expected 
where this is not done ; for a copy previously engraved or written
-P-A-G-E-155
142. The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
gives the children no help in the matter of beginning, forming and 
joining lettets—or, at least, though it can be made to do so by 
tracing over, it does not do so in such a living way as the copy 
written before the children’s eyes. The writing of a good black- 
board copy in the course of a lesson demands some skill ; but such 
skill as is needed may be acquired by all who make steady and per- 
severing effort, and present-day training puts it within the reach 
of all. Work among student-teachers shows that the number of 
them who cannot acquire in a year a sufficiently good blackboard 
“ hand ” for the purpose of teaching writing is small, and nothing 
but perseverance is required to make it still better. : 
In addition to preventing errors in the way of beginning, form- 
ing and joining letters, the writing of blackboard copies in front of 
the class has other advantages. It allows of collective teaching 
and collective correction. When children are set to write from 
copy-books with headlines it is a difficult matter to keep them all 
writing the same word at the same time, and, when they do not 
do so, they make individual faults which, requiring individual 
correction, cause waste of time. The use of blackboard copies, 
again, enables us to grade difficulties according to the needs of our 
own pupils in a way which is impossible in the case of copy-books 
with headlines. : 
In writing as in reading words may be taught as wholes, or 
built up by putting together their elements which have been taught 
separately. Thus, for example, in reading we may teach our 
pupils to look at the word cat and to say it by one effort of seeing 
and sounding, or may teach them its parts c-a-t, successively, and 
afterwards require them to put these together to form the whole 
word. Similarly in teaching writing, we may put the whole word 
at before the class as a copy, or we may teach the letters—or even 
the elements composing the letters—successively, and later combine 
them to form the word. 
There are certain advantages claimed for each of these methods 
respectively, by those who advocate the use of them, and they are 
advantages which must be admitted by impartial critics, On be- 
half of the method of teaching whole words it is urged justly that it 
is both more natural (that is to say, it follows more closely the way 
of learning to speak) and more interesting—words having more 
interest, because more meaning, for the children than letters, and 
letters than elements. But while it is necessary that our methods
-P-A-G-E-156
The Teaching of Writing 143 
shall be as natural and as interesting as possible, it is also necessary 
for us to bear in mind that little fingers must have simple tasks. 
The children’s eyes, too, at this early age are unable to see a number 
of parts in their relation to each other. 
This advantage of a simplicity suited to the children’s age, is 
rightly claimed for the method which builds up words letter by 
letter ; but its opponents argue, with some show of reason, that 
the elements of words can have no possible interest for children, 
as they can have no possible meaning. Well, if little children 
were always interested in meanings alone, we should have to admit 
the contention ; but we know, from our own experience of them, 
that they are often very little interested in meanings. We 
frequently hear them shout some jingle of meaningless sounds for 
half an hour together, with every appearance of absorbing enjoy- 
ment. At such times they are interested, not in meaning but in 
action ; and so, when they are being taught the elements of letters 
in order that they may concentrate muscle and mind on single, 
simple forms, they are interested—not certainly in the meaning, 
but in the making of them. 
In the case of writing as in the case of reading, we may admit 
the natural method to be the better under ideal conditions ; but 
where the conditions are not ideal—where the teacher fails in 
skill or power of discipline, or the children have been badly taught 
in infant classes and first standard—writing, like reading, may 
suffer, if the method adopted for teaching does not lay sufficient 
emphasis on the elements of which letters and words are 
composed. 
A good plan for a Sub-Standard or Standard I class is. to 
begin by setting for copy, if not whole words, at any rate whole 
letters. Then, if there are found in the class children who are 
unable to reproduce well as much as was set at first, to separate 
them from the rest and give them systematic practice in elements, 
combining these by degrees until the children have passed the 
point of difficulty and are able to rejoin the class. If the class to 
be taught is higher than Standard I or II and is found to be a 
class of bad writers, it will be better to put them back, with perhaps 
a few exceptions, to drill on the elements as the quickest and 
surest way of correcting faults of construction. With an average 
class, of whatever standard, it should be possible to set copies of 
whole letters, words, or sentences as a general rule, reverting to
-P-A-G-E-157
144 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
the elements of them whenever some particular form proves a 
stumbling-block. In ‘short, a judicious combination of the two 
methods, as conditions dictate, is likely to have better results than 
the use of either exclusively. 
There is, perhaps, no other school subject for the teaching and 
practice of which right physical conditions are of such vital im- 
portance. If the conditions of lighting and position are wrong, 
eyesight, spine, and lungs may all be permanently injured during 
school years. This will be easily understood when it is considered 
how much time school children spend, particularly i in the higher 
standards, in the act of writing—not that given to copy writing 
alone ; but to the writing of compositions, of much of their arith- 
metic, and to test writing in all subjects. In all this writing our 
pupils will tend to take and keep the position which became 
habitual in their first writing lessons. Again, if the light is in- 
sufficient, or the children are badly placed with regard to it, there 
may be constant eye: strain. We thus see how very important it 
is that attention be given to these two matters of lighting and 
position. 
While the amount of light in a school or classroom is largely 
a matter of architecture for which the builders are responsible, 
we can ourselves regulate its direction with regard to the children 
when writing. It should come from the left rear of the children— 
over their left shoulder—and the desks should, therefore, be placed 
to the right of the main windows, each row a little in advance of 
that through which the chief light comes to it. There should then 
be a gangway on the left in order that the end children on that 
side do not sit in the shadow of the wall. A supplementary window 
higher in the wall at the back of the class would increase the light 
without any danger of causing a marked shadow and so injuring 
the children’s eyesight. 
While absolute uniformity of position should not be insisted 
on in a class, as the children will differ considerably in size and 
build, we must see that no child assumes a position which is slovenly 
or awkward or likely to prove, if persisted in, injurious to health 
and growth, - 
To protect the chest and spine it will be necessary first to see 
that the desks are suited to the size of the children using them. 
They must not be too high, or the children will be strained in 
reaching them. They must not be too low, or they will sit in a
-P-A-G-E-158
Re 
EE The Teaching of Writing 145 
hunched position with cramped chest. They must not all be of 
the same height, as the children in a class vary much in size. 
They should slope at an angle of fifteen degrees. These conditions 
being fulfilled, we must then, to guard against a twisted position 
which may induce curvature of the spine, see that the children sit 
square to the desks. Their feet must be placed firmly on the floor 
or foot-rest, while their left forearms lie horizontally along the 
bottom edge of the desk. We shall need to check the strong ten- 
dency the children show to move the elbow upwards till it points 
at last to the top of the desk, the forearm then lying obliquely 
instead of horizontally—a position which strains the back and 
side. 
To protect the eyesight we must see that the pupils’ heads 
are not inclined sideways to the desk, but bent slightly forward 
and downward. The best corrective for the wrong position is to 
insist on their papers being straight in front of them, Their feyes 
should not approach within twelve inches of papers or books,” 
The matter of pen-holding is also important. In the very early 
stages nothing need be said to the children about the way they hold 
their “instruments.” These will at ‘first be chalks, crayons or 
pencils, which children do not as a rule hold awkwardly. Even 
in the beginning, however, they may learn that for writing, in which 
the strokes of the pencil must be firmer and steadier, the hand needs 
more support than in drawing, and that to give this in the best way 
they must rest the point of the little finger and the part of the hand 
near the wrist on the table or desk. A step towards later correct 
pen-holding has been made when this position of the hand becomes 
habitual in writing. 
In Standard I—or at least Standard II—when the pen super- 
sedes the pencil,more strict injunctions will be necessary to teach the 
correct manipulation of the two-pronged nib, as the need for equal 
pressure on both prongs demands a careful holding of the pen. This 
is secured by placing it between the stretched thumb and fore- 
finger of the right hand, and then, bending the thumb, curving 
slightly the forefinger and bringing up the second finger to support 
it on the side opposite the thumb. The proper way of supporting 
the hand having been learnt, the children will not find much diffi- 
culty in maintaining this position of the fingers, as they seem to 
close naturally round the pen, giving it the firmness of a triangular 
support,

Il children should. have practice in this method of pen-holding by 
means of some form, of drill, not merely for the sake of saving time 
and securing uniformity of action, but because they are entering 
upon the stage of growth in which drill methods play a necessary 
part in their development. 
The pen on being passed should be placed in the groove of the 
desk, with its handle towards the left. Some such drill as the 
following should then, after being carefully taught, be given 
without variation at each lesson : 
' Command. Meaning. 
Lift pen between left thumb and forefinger, 
holding it near the top of the handle. 
Transfer pen to position between right thumb 
_and forefinger—the thumb pressing the left, side, 
One the forefinger resting on top. 
Get pen and fingers into right position for writing. 
Place the second finger beside the forefinger, 
pressing the right side of the pen about an inch from 
the end. 
Two Place yourselves in position—feet on floor, chest 
square to the desk, left forearm lying horizontally 
along the bottom edge—and look at the blackboard. 
Three Dip pens in ink and—bending head slightly for- 
ward and downward—begin to write. 
One more point remains to be dealt with before returning to 
the matter of the development of formal writing lessons—the 
question of size of writing. For young children “large hand ” is 
easier than “ small,” and they will get their best practice through 
a script a little larger than text-hand, written between clearly 
marked lines, This size should be the one required of them through 
the Sub-Standard and Standard I years. In Standard IH the 
size may diminish to be written between half-text—} inch—ruling. 
In Standard III the ruling should be narrower again, small hand— 
} of text==4 inch—being suitable, and from time to time the. chil- 
dren should be practised writing this size on single lines, while 
text-hand copies should be given occasionally, but not more than
-P-A-G-E-160
The Teaching of Writing 147 
occasionally. In Standard IV and above the writing should never 
—except during the still more occasional practice of text-hand— 
be between double lines, and the pupils should write frequently on 
unlined paper. 
We may now return to the development throughout the stan- 
dards of the formal lessons in writing. They begin, as has been 
said, with lists of single words copied in printed characters from 
blackboard or reading sheet, and a little later from reading books. 
The use of coloured crayons will, at this time, increase the children’s 
pleasure in the task of transcribing, and may be continued so long 
as the printed characters are copied. When, however, the chil- 
dren pass on to combining script letters into words it would spoil 
their joinings and retard speed to keep to it longer. 
Following the lists of words in printed characters comes, as 
soon as a sufficient number of letter groups has been mastered, 
the making of parallel columns of words, in which the script form 
is written to the right of the printed one, thus : 
p it pat prt 
bell bett Lett 
dog dog doy 
A little later the printed characters should be dropped altogether, 
and then, as soon as possible, the children should be advanced to 
the writing of sentences—not sentences from their reader or from 
our blackboard model, but sentences of their own composing. 
For instance, we might ask: “‘ Which children would like to tell 
mother in a little letter what they have done at school to-day ? ” 
The response would be very general, so we might continue: “ Very 
well; but we have done many things. Which of them shall we tell? 
What do you say, Susie p—Willie >—Fanny ?” continuing until 
we have got a decisive vote for one activity, as, for example, for at 
school to-day. we read about three bears. Though this sentence 
draws its letters from five writing groups, we shall be surprised to
-P-A-G-E-161
148 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
find how soon and with what ease the children will’ transcribe 
it and other similar sentences with the interest of“ writing to 
mother” td help them, So, ina few weeks at most, they find 
themselves able to write a letter—though a very short one. * When 
a letter has been written the children who tried very hard should 
be allowed to “post” their exercise book in their school !bag 
and “ deliver” it to mother, who will, of course, return itf next 
day. ‘ The figures to ro should be taught in the writing—not arith~ 
metic—lessons of the Sub-Standard years. 
Capitals are not required of infant class children, and without 
them a letter cannot assume its proper form. My own experience, 
however, is that children in their last infant year master capital 
forms very readily, especially when these are only the small forms 
enlarged to double size. As it is by going on that children are 
helped to go further, there seems no reason why the delight of 
writing “a real letter” should be deferred until the standards. 
When one or two capitals have been mastered there is no great 
difficulty attending the writing of such a letter as follows : 
At School, 
Monday. 
Dear M. other, —This morning we began a new song about a lamb. 
When we have learnt it all, I will sing it to you. 
Your loving 
Jack. 
No instructions, of course, as to the form of letters would be 
given. The children would simply be told when to begin a new 
line and when to use capitals. They would then, through practising 
the right form, learn at an early age to avoid mistakes which, at 
present, are sometimes found in the letters of upper standard 
children. 
Another reason for teaching capitals as soon as a class—irre- 
spective of standard—has mastered the small forms, is that children 
are always eager to write their own names, and these, of course, 
require capitals, 
Still this may rightly be regarded as Standard work, and we 
must always be guided by circumstances. If the children seem 
unable to keep this pace we must slacken it. The making and
-P-A-G-E-162
The Teaching of Writing 149 
use, in sentences and letter, of capital forms might then be the 
distinctive work of Standard I. 
Whether capitals are taught in the Sub-Standards or in Stan- 
dard I, such lessons in which wholé sentences are written in “ real 
letters ” must alternate with others in which the children go at 
a much slower pace. One lesson should be given—except in the 
case of a few really excellent writers—to the practice of elements 
or letters, another to the combining of letters into words, and only 
every third lesson at this stage to the application of the practical 
skill thus acquired, to what is its true purpose—self-expression. In 
all early lessons we must have two aims—the one to increase 
mechanical skill in writing, the other to sustain and sharpen i interest 
in its instrumental use. 
While, till the end of the Standard I year, self-expression should 
only be expected on matters of general interest to the children, 
their parents, friends and teacher, in Standard II there should be 
a little development in the direction of concentrating thought on 
some particular subject—as, for example, nature studies or lessons 
in geography. 
Here again the mechanical and expressive sides of writing 
should share between them the time given to the subject at this 
stage, dividing it equally. In mechanical writing greater perfec- 
tion of form should be looked for; in expressive writing greater 
speed without deterioration of form. Standard II children should 
be able to fill a page of their exercise books with their own 
thoughts in half an hour without any carelessness as to shape of 
letters becoming apparent. 
The main development expected in Standard III should be 
greater speed—and therefore quantity—in expressive writing, 
occasional practice in text-hand, and some practice in writing on 
single lines. The value of text-hand practice at this stage is, that 
it revises and impresses, by its greater size, the form and pro- 
portions of elements and letters at a time when children are giving 
up frequent mechanical practice for a further use of expressive 
writing which may lead them to disregard these features. It also 
checks the tendency to write a small, cramped hand, which is 
often seen when children are no longer required to write between 
lines. 
In writing text-hand children often fail to space the lines 
properly, so spoiling the look of their pages. A very simple in-
-P-A-G-E-163
150 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
junction will overcome this spacing difficulty: “ Write on every 
third line.” All children will understand this to mean that the 
short letters must rest on every third line, loops and tails reaching 
above and below it ; and, if in their early lessons they are reminded 
of the rule every time they begin a new line, and are made to 
count down to each successive third, unequal spacing will soon 
disappear. 
With expressive writing the children should still be able to fill 
a page of their exercise books in a half hour, though this, owing to 
the smaller lines and spaces of Standard IIT books, demands a fair 
rate of speed. 
By the end of the Standard III year writing as a mechanical 
art should be mastered, its further use, except for very occasional 
revisionary lessons in text and “ cursive,” that is “ running,” or or- 
dinary speed writing, being entirely expressive. From this point 
exercise books should be single lined, and frequent practice in 
writing on unlined papérs should make the children independent 
of any guide lines. From one to two pages—according to standard 
—of expressive writing may reasonably be required of them at this 
stage, for children should be able easily to fill a page with writing 
matter which they have no need to think out, in a quarter of an 
hour. : 
While lessons to increase mechanical skill aré being almost 
given up, the children must not simply be left to fill so many pages 
im so many minutes. There is still work for us to do. This lies 
in the direction of improving their current or running hand. As 
the training of good curséve writing has been much neglected in our 
schools, suggestions for treating a writing lesson with this aim, at 
this stage, are given below. 
Supject.—Cursive Writing. 
Ciass.—Any Standard from IV upwards. 
When materials have been distributed and passed turn towards 
the class a blackboard on which is written a passage of from twelve 
‘to twenty lines—or as a variation choose a paragraph of this length 
from one of their readers—and allow the children seven or eight 
minutes in which to copy it at ordinary writing speed. While this 
is being done, pass round the class, making mental notes of the 
general faults observed.
-P-A-G-E-164
The Teaching of Writing 151 
Return to the front of the class, and, calling for attention, 
begin to criticise the writing done under the following heads : 
(t) Speed. Children who have written too quickly—as shown 
by careless formations—must be reproved. 
Note.—No speed is too great unless it results in this carelessness 
of form. The quicker the better from every other point of view ; 
but very quick writers must always be kept occupied by some 
means till the rest are finished. 
Those children who have been too slow must be reminded that 
speed is necessary as well as legibility and neatnegs. 
(2) Position and Pen-holding. Any wide departure from rule 
must be commented on. 
(3) Legibility. Remind the children whose writing cannot be 
read at a glance that legibility is the first quality of all good writing, 
and that it is a quality which all children may acquire. Point out 
the chief causes of the illegibility. 
(4) Slope. The worst fault in this particular is the habit of 
backward sloping. It is ugly, and tends to make writing illegible. 
Irregular slope also makes the reading of script difficult, and spoils 
the look of it. Upright writing retards speed and causes entang- 
ling of loops and tails. Remind offenders in any of these directions 
of the correct slope, and illustrate it on the blackboard (a) in prox- 
imity to a vertical line and (6) in a word. 
(5) Roundness. Express the opinion that angular writing is 
less pleasing to the eye than a rounded hand, while it also retards 
speed. 
(6) Proportion. The marked tendency to equalise the heights 
of all letters must be reproved. Some children when writing 
quickly are apt to shorten the long letters till they hardly reach 
above the short ones and render the writing illegible. The opposite 
fault of over-long loops and tails must also be corrected, and the fact 
that maintaining the right proportion of the letters improves both 
the clearness and appearance of the writing must be emphasized. 
(7) Joinings. Any faults in the junction of letters must be 
pointed out and corrected. The chief are the want of any, i.e. 
discontinuity, or too long or too sharp joinings. Irregular turnings, 
now long and now short, spoil the appearance of writing. 
(8) Spacing. This must be corrected where irregular or other- 
wise faulty. The general rule that word-spacing must be twice 
letter-spacing should be emphasized.

152 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
_ Note that no reference has been made to fineness or thickness 
of upstrokes and downstrokes. This is immaterial in a running 
hand. 
Have the paragraph, or & portion of it, rewritten. Choose the 
papers of individual pupils whose faults were most noticeable the 
first time, and note whether improvement has been made. If not, 
have the writing re-copied in their leisure time. 
The treatment of writing in this chapter differs in some respects 
from the method of teaching and practice advocated in special 
manuals on the Subject. This is because the specialist in writing 
is apt to look at his subject as isolated from all others, and to em- 
phasize particularly the need for mechanical perfection. We, as 
class teachers, cannot afford to do this, but must regard writing 
first and foremost as an expressive subject which, by reason of its 
use in testing, is closely interwoven with all others. Having as 
class teachers the responsibility for all class subjects we must, 
though striving for the highest possible degree of mechanical skill, 
give our main efforts to cultivating it as an instrumental and ex- 
pressive art, 
B..THE TEACHING OF SPELLING 
It is customary to treat spelling as though it were a separate 
subject by itself ; but a little reflection will show that it is a neces- 
sary accompaniment of all the branches of intelligent writing (as 
opposed to penmanship) namely, transcription, dictation and com- 
position, and that it has no use apart from these. 
For what is spelling? Think for a moment of a language which 
has never been written down; as, for example, the Bushman speech. 
There is no need of spelling so far as that language is concerned. 
It is only when a language passes into the written stage that the 
need arises. With the representation of sounds by forms, rules 
come into being. A code of signs -must be agreed upon and kept 
to by all writers of the language, or readers will have difficulty in 
understanding. Anyone who wishes to write the language must 
know all the forms or signs which represent spoken sounds, and be 
able.to combine them in correct order. He must, in short, be able 
to spell. Real spelling consists in writing the words down. In 
real spelling we deal with sounds and forms only. The names of
-P-A-G-E-166
The Teaching of Spelling 153 
letters have nothing to do with it. How is it, then, that these are 
so much used in the usual spelling lessons in schools ? Because of 
the wish to save time. Real spelling—the writing down of letters 
in correct order to form words—takes a considerable time ; the 
naming of the letters merely, takes much less. In order, therefore, 
to find out speedily whether pupils can spell the words of a test, the 
quicker naming of the letters is commonly resorted to. From this 
practice has arisen the use of the term spelling for the process of 
saying the names of the letters in order, but it must be remembered 
that this is simply a quick way of testing the power to spell. 
Perhaps you feel that there is no difference. It is, however, 
of great importance that we should distinguish between the two 
processes, because errors of method in teaching and learning will 
arise from our not doing so. If we see no distinction between naming 
letters and real spelling we shall get the idea that the former is a 
quicker way of learning to spell, just as it is a quicker way of testing 
the power to do it. As a matter of fact, it is a very slow and 
laborious way, and should be given up to a great extent. This 
will be done as soon as it is realised that spelling is concerned with 
the form of words, and must, therefore, be mastered chiefly through 
the eye—not mainly by the ear through the mechanical repetition 
of sounds. 
Let us go back again. After a language had passed into the 
written stage, would most people learn to read or to spell first ? 
To read, of course. This should be our guide in teaching in the 
early stages of our language work. At first it will be well in passing 
from speech to confine attention to reading—to giving sound to 
form. The reverse process of giving form to sound should not be 
begun till later. As a general rule it is not wise to begin it as a 
memory test until the second Sub-Standard year, any writing (or 
printing) of forms before that timebeing from copy. The strengthen- 
ing of association between sound and form gained in this way is of 
more value than the satisfaction of seeing what the children can do. 
When once the mechanical art of writing has been mastered, 
the power to read any word should be a guarantee of the power to 
spell it, If, however, children during their reading lessons look 
about and, instead of reading the words with their eyes and their 
thoughts fixed upon them as they say them, merely catch up the 
sounds of them from their teacher or from other children, they 
‘will not learn either to read or to spell. The practice of keep-
-P-A-G-E-167
154 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
ing a class of children reading all the year round from a 
single standard reader tends, by familiarising them with the order 
of words in the different lessons, to make such a mechanical repeti- 
tion of them possible. The speed with which young children, 
particularly, learn by heart the words of their readers, is a fact 
which has not been brought home to many a young teacher who 
listens with pride to their fluent “reading.” But if we watch any 
class up to say Standard ITI, we shall find that there are a number 
of children who can read (?) quite as fluently with their eyes wander- 
ing about the room. Such children, we must remember, make ab- 
solutel'y no progress in either reading or spelling while reading any 
lesson the words of which they have learnt by heart. 
The words which a child should learn to spell first are those 
which he uses in ordinary speech, in order that later he may be 
able to write them correctly when he passes from oral to written 
composition. The reports of inspectors show that the day is not 
far distant when the spelling test will be taken not from the reading 
book, but from the child’s ordinary speech. In the lower standards, 
where oral composition is required, the natural test will be the 
writing down at dictation of a number of sentences previously 
given to the inspector by the children, or a number of words 
chosen from them. So far as it is necessary to test the spelling of 
upper standards pupils, beyond the limits of their composition 
exercises, the test will be an unseen one comprising words which in 
the examiner’s opinion should form part of their vocabulary. 
Spelling should be taught incidentally, of course, during every 
reading lesson, for the words in a suitable reader will not differ 
widely from those which are, or ought to be, in use among children 
who have been taught to speak on the lines laid down in an earlier 
chapter. But this training in the habit of examining and noting 
the forms of words should be a very different thing from the 
drudgery of learning them by mechanical repetition. Let us see 
how we may set about it. 
Words which are “ regular” may be left, when sound drills are 
given in connection with reading, to take care of themselves. 
‘Through constant attention to sounds and the symbols repre- 
sénting them, the children will soon acquire the power of building 
any such words. “Irregular” words, on the other hand, will 
need special attention. In preparing any reading lesson we should 
bear spelling in mind. By the time we have read through the
-P-A-G-E-168
The Teaching of Spelling 155 
lesson we should know what spelling difficulties recur most fre- 
quently in it, and these should form part of the spelling ‘exercise 
for the day. It should occupy a full twenty minutes, ten minutes 
or even five being sufficient for a test on what has been taught. 
It should be taken before the reading lesson, as then the greater 
number of the mechanical difficulties of reading will be disposed 
of before that lesson begins, and teacher and children will be able 
to give more attention to meaning and expression. 
In addition to such treatment of words occurring in readers, 
we should make use in formal spelling exercises of a variety of 
methods,.so as to ensure every child’s finding one which is to him, 
personally, the easiest. While spelling should be much more a 
matter of learning through the eye than it is, there are children 
who are more ear-minded than eye-minded, and others who are 
muscle-minded—that is to say, we shall find in every class some 
who learn to spell more readily by sounding than by seeing, and 
some who learn more readily by writing down the words than by 
any other method. To give equal opportunity to all these types 
of chiidren it will be necessary, while remembering that the eye 
should play the chief part in learning to spell, to make use of other 
methods, including learning by heart, transcribing, word-building 
and word-grouping. 
As it is necessary to give some definite idea of what should -be 
attempted in each standard, suitable exercises are suggested 
below. In the second Sub-Standard year, as has been said, 
the great necessity is to impress the right forms of such words as 
the children are in the habit of using. The best and most suitable 
way of doing this will be by means of transcription exercises. 
These should be given frequently—no day passing without one— 
while dictation exercises, for testing the power gained, should te 
correspondingly infrequent, one each week being all that is ‘neces- 
sary. 
It might seem, on first thoughts, that a transcription exercise 
would yield an opportunity of attending to some necessary pre- 
paration or correction; but in reality such lessons require 
just as careful and constant supervision as any. This, of course, 
is more particularly true when young children are transcribing. 
Every error made will be likely to yield a plentiful crop of future 
mistakes, so that the greatest care must be exercised to prevent 
them.
-P-A-G-E-169
156 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
The meaning of the sentence given for transcription should either 
be self-evident or the exercise should follow a reading lesson in 
which it has been explained, for to set children to write what they 
do not understand is to encourage unintelligent habits of work. 
The sentence should also have some point or meaning in itself. 
A line of verse is suitable for Sub-Standard or Standard I children ; 
as, for instance, “ He who lies late will never be wise.’ 
A short sentence is the best exercise in lower standards, and it 
should be one which will help to carry out both the main and the 
minor purposes of transcription, namely, to improve spelling and 
writing, to convey information, and to cultivate style. The 
sentence. given above fulfils all these conditions. As a spelling 
exercise it teaches—through lies and wise—two ways of repre- 
senting 7+s (voiced), and i impresses the form of the irregular word 
who; asa writing exercise it gives practice in forming looped 
letters ; the matter is valuable as a proverb, and the form is pleasing 
through alliteration. 
In Standard I the transcription exercises should be supple- 
mented by word-building exercises and lessons dealing with 
peculiarities in the spelling of common words, Lessons should 
not be longer than fifteen or twenty minutes, the remaining ten or 
five being used for the purpose of testing by a short dictation 
exercise what has been taught. A short test following a lesson 
will be more valuable than a long one—say on a page learnt as 
homework—in which dictation and correction take up the whole 
half-hour. The aim of a dictation test is to find what words have 
not been mastered ; but it has to be remembered that every time 
a wrong form is written, it tends to impress itself on the mind and 
to increase the likelihood of the mistake being repeated. For this 
reason it is bad policy to let the children see their mistakes, 
and there is much to be said for the practice of having dictation 
- tests written on loose papers which are passed in and ot returned 
after marking, the children being told what words require correc- 
tion. If it is preferred to have the tests in an exercise book kept 
by the children, words wrongly spelt should not be underlined when 
marked, but left with nothing to draw attention to them, the 
correct form being written above the incorrect, or in the margin, 
in letters of such size or colour that the eye is immediately caught 
by them. It is for the same reason that most dictation tests should 
follow preparation.
-P-A-G-E-170
The Teaching of Spelling 157 
In Standard II sufficient progress will be made if the tran- 
scription, word-building, word-grouping and dictation exercises 
are continued and developed. Longer dictation tests—occupying 
15 or 20 minutes—may now be given, say every other day or twice 
a week. They must, however, almost always follow preparation, 
The manner of preparation should vary from time to time, being 
made in any one of the following ways—during a reading lesson, 
by transcription, in a spelling lesson, as homework or immediately 
before the test. 
In addition to transcription and word-building exercises and 
dictation tests attention should be given in Standard III to common 
irregularities, as, for example, in the use of g and A, so frequently 
silent at the beginning and in the middle of words. 
Tn all these lower standards the children should be gaining 
familiarity with the use of common words which may be con- 
fused: those which are spelt differently but pronounced alike, 
e.g. blue, blew ; those spelt alike but pronounced differently, e.g. 
tear (= water drop from eye), tear (rend); and those distinguished 
in pronunciation though the difference is slight, e.g. where, wear, 
were. ‘They should be taught intelligently in sentences given for 
the purpose, and as they are met with in speech and reading. 
The attempt to teach them mechanically in a long list will only 
end in failure. 
A suitable development in Standard IV, combining as it does 
spelling and grammar, is word-building by the adiditon of gram- 
matical suffixes, e.g. 
tap _tap’p’ed tap’p'ing rob rob’b’ed _ rob’b’ing 
net _—nett/ed net't/ing sun sun’n’ed —_sun’n’ing 
whip whip’p’ed  whip’p‘ing run = ran run‘n’ing 
Rule (obtained—at any rate in crude form--from children). 
When we add “ed” or “ing” to words of one syllable ending in 
a single consonant with a single short vowel in front of it, we must 
double the consonant at the end of the word. 
Note.—A sufficient number of examples—never less than three, 
and more if time permits—must be supplied before any attempt is 
made to obtain the rule. When this is being formed we may 
help by pointing out in order the facts that influence it—in 
the case above that the original words are one-syllabled, have
-P-A-G-E-171
158 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
a single consonant at the end, and a single short vowel in 
front. 
Words with more than one syllable with various endings should 
be treated similarly. Any good spelling book will give the rules, 
but these should always be discovered by our pupils from examples 
supplied. 
From Standard V upwards our pupils should be making ac- 
quaintance with common roots of Saxon, Latin and Greek origin, 
and some of the spelling exercises should be based on this work. 
A number of words may be transcribed in a column, and then 
divided into their parts—prefix, roots and suffix—the language 
to which each belongs being written above. 
Our knowledge of child nature tells us that mechanical and 
drill methods of learning are naturally distasteful to pupils of upper 
standard years, and we must therefore be careful at this stage to 
present all matter in a manner that appeals to their interest and 
intelligence. One of the best ways of making senior spelling 
lessons interesting is to combine them with history. 
In Standard V, where the Norman Conquest forms part of the 
syllabus, a spelling lesson contrasting Norman with Saxon words 
will help to show how language was affected. The following 
passage, taken from Chapter I of Sir Walter Scott’s Ivanhoe, 
provides a very suitable exercise. All the words in italics are of 
Anglo-Saxon origin, and it should be pointed out that they aremainly 
little words. denoting common objects and actions—‘ homely ” 
words, as wesay. The Norman words, on the other hand, suggest 
the experience of a people of higher culture and civilisation : 
“<«Why, how call you those grunting brutes running about on 
their four legs ?’ demanded Wamba. 
“© Swine, fool, swine, said the herd, ‘ every fool knows that.’ 
“* And swine is good Saxon, said the Jester ; ‘ but how call you 
the sow when she is flayed and drawn and quartered, and swung up 
by the heels, like a traitor ?” 
“¢ Pork,’ answered the swineherd. 
“« Tamvery glad every fool knows that too, said Wamba, ‘ and 
- pork J think is good Norman-French ; and so when the brute lives, 
and is in the charge of a Saxon slave, she goes by her Saxon name ; 
but becomes a Norman, and is called pork, when she is carried to the 
Castle-hall io feast among the nobles ; what dost thou think of this, 
friend Gurth, ha?’ ”
-P-A-G-E-172
The Teaching of Spelling 159 
Further lessons should show how other elements entered the 
language—the adoption of Latin words, for instance, through 
Roman occupation and tHe introduction of Christianity ; of later 
French, through the long intercourse between the two nations 
through landownership and consequent quarrels and warfare from 
Norman to Napoleonic times, and since, through travel and culture ; 
of Greek—frequently in a Latinised form because of the earlier use 
of that language—through the spread of Greek literature and 
learning after 1453. 
The history of the higher standards will likewise yield openings 
for other spelling lessons with an historical interest, as, for example, 
one to show how the development of science caused further additions 
from Latin and Greek—the learned languages ; and another to show 
how Italian words are mostly connected with music and painting, in 
which arts the Italian masters were our teachers from the fifteenth 
century. South African children should have a special interest in 
being taught the words of Dutch origin—connected with land- 
scape and portrait-painting and seamanship—which point to a 
time when England learnt these arts from the Low Countries. A 
lesson on Spanish words will go fitly with the history of Elizabethan 
times, when England met her great enemy on the Spanish Main. 
Portuguese, Russian and Turkish words have been gathered 
through commerce and colonisation in the East. Those of 
Malayan origin have a special interest in this country. Another 
lesson might be given on words gained through colonisation and 
commerce in the West. 
Of course such spelling lessons would fail altogether to inspire 
interest if all that was done was to provide lists of words and to 
tell their origin and the date at which they were borrowed. There 
must always be a connection, existing or made before the lesson is 
given, between the matter of it and some previous knowledge or 
experience possessed by the children, and the new matter must 
be presented in such a way that it vivifies history while introducing 
words in connection with facts that lend them interest. 
More advanced lessons in word-building or word-formation 
should be given with the aim of improving not spelling alone, | 
but grammarfand composition. It will therefore be possible 
to take them alternately in the time allotted to any one of 
these. 
The following suggestive exercises are taken from Exercises

in English Word-Formation and Derivation (Frank Ritchie. Swan

(x) Give adjectives derived from the following nouns. 
Example; valour—-valorous. 
(2) Form verbs from the following nouns. Example: light— 
lighten. . 
(3) Form diminutives from the following. Example: river— 
rivulet. . 
(4) From what words are the following frequentatives formed ? 
Example : straddle—stride. 
(5) Form by adding or changing prefixes words having con-

agreeable. 
(6) Add from among these suffixes—ar, er, or, re—the proper 
terminations to the following. Example: doct+or. 
In these upper standards silent dictation should occasionally 
be substituted for the more ordinary test. For this we should 
place a blackboard before the class, and calling attention to it write 
on. it a word, phrase or sentence. After allowing a minute or two 
for silent study of the words written, we should cover the writ- 
ing, or turn the board, and tell our pupils to write them from 
memory. .

CHAPTER VII . 
THE TEACHING OF GRAMMAR 
“All language, both learned and mother tongues, be gotten only by 
imitation. For as ye use to hear, so ye learn to speak: if ye hear no other, 
ye speak not yourself: and whom ye only hear, of them ye only learn. And, 
therefore, if ye would speak as the best and wisest do, ye must be conversant 
where the best and wisest are; but if ye be born and brought up in a rude 
country, ye shall not choose but speak rudely: the rudest man of all knoweth 
this to be true.” —RoGER ASCHAM (1570). - 
(Spelling modernised.] © 
Grammar has not in the past been a very popular subject 
either with téachers or with children. Many causes have contri- 
buted to the dislike of it. Its purposes as a subject of school 
instruction have been to some extent misunderstood ; and, where 
rightly understood, have not always been achieved. The teaching 
of it has been of too formal a nature, and the reasoning demanded 
by it too abstract. The difficulty of getting children to grasp its 
principles, rules; and definitions has led to their being set to be mem- 
orised from blackboard or text-book, and the fear of the examination 
has confirmed teachers in this mistaken method of treating the 
subject. 
Teachers who have expected their pupils to learn to speak and 
write correctly as a result of their grammar lessons, may well regard 
them with all the dislike born of disappointment. Grammar léssons 
do not help them much in this particular. Speaking and writing 
are not learnt by rule; but by imitation and practice. “All 
languages, both learned and mother tongue, be gotten only by 
imitation. For as ye use to hear, so ye learn to speak.” If any 
proof of this is wanted it is to be found in the differences in the 
speech of individual children in a class which has had the same 
grammar lessons from Standard III upwards. The home influence 
generally outweighs that of any instruction given. Of course, there 
is, too, a heavy time handicap to be taken into account. Even if 
161 L
-P-A-G-E-175
162 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
rules played a much larger part in learning to speak than they do, 
the two half-hour grammar lessons a week could not be expected 
to keep pace with the twelve-hours’ pattern and ‘practice daily, 
which the children’s out-of-school life affords them. 
Nor is it a chief function of grammar to add to the number of 
words which the pupils can use in speech and writing. Their 
ordinary vocabulary will not be much enriched by the study of it. 
New words are adopted when they are heard or seen or practised 
frequently. It is from conversational, reading and composition 
lessons in school, and from reading, friendships and business rela- 
tions out of it, that additions to the vocabulary will come. In 
grammar lessons the pupils’ thoughts should not be directed chiefly 
to the new words occurring. in the given exercises; but to the 
relations existing between words, and the changes that they 
undergo. Of course, a little can be done incidentally with this 
aim in view, and we may from time to time introduce into our 
chosen sentences (in such connections that they cannot fail to be 
understood) new words which we desire our pupils to use. We 
must not expect, however, to accomplish much in this direction. 
But even where the purpose of grammar teaching has been 
understood the results have still been disappointing. This is be- 
cause the conditions under which children can be led to think have 
not been supplied by the teacher. Possibly they have not been 
understood. The first indispensable condition is interest. This 
has to be cultivated. Children’s interest in words grows with their 
power to use them in speech and written composition, and at first 
will not be found apart from this power. Early grammar lessons, 
then, must keep close to the work in composition. Just so far as 
they fail to do this, and concern themselves instead with mechanical 
memorising of rules and definitions, they will fail to inspire interest 
and so be barren of result. The formal, scientific study of gram- 
mar, while it can be made to yield interest and stimulating exercise 
to older pupils, is too much a matter of abstract reasoning to be 
successful in the case of young children. What they need is to have 
the knowledge of words which they have already gained, extended 
by exercises and tests. Grammar in the lower standards should 
be an examination of the words the children themselves use, of the 
work these words do and of the changes they undergo. When 
we recognise this and give our pupils the kind of lessons they 
need, the subject speedily becomes a favourite one: “ It becomes
-P-A-G-E-176
Tg, een dente nn le The Teaching of Grammar 163 
for them a living subject, so soon as they begin to realise how much 
the loss of any one of the chief parts of speech would affect their 
power of expressing their thoughts.” From this point rules and 
definitions are no longer memorised without being understood ; 
but are readily formed, learned and remembered because under- 
stood, Elementary school courses make it easily possible for 
grammar to be taught on these lines ; for nothing in the nature 
of formal parsing or analysis is required of junior pupils. In the 
upper standards temptation to save time by having rules, definitions 
and lists unintelligently memorised, may be greater. But here, 
as elsewhere, two considerations must be borne in mind—one, that 
the children’s needs go beyond the examination room, and the 
other, that even this narrow examination end is best served in- 
directly—not by giving to be mechanically worked innumerable 
exercises which imitate as closely as possible likely examination 
ones, but by developing power to deal with any exercise. 
Having taken this glance at the mistakes and misunderstand- 
ings connected with grammar teaching in the past, we must con- 
sider in more detail the method to be adopted in future. 
Grammar teaching in the lower standards should be simply an 
examination of the sentences made in oral composition. It is, 
indeed, a part of the intelligent teaching of that subject and it 
should be quite informal. “ Until a child has learnt to think 
consecutively, and to express his thoughts clearly, he has no basis 
for that more formal study of language which is called Grammar.” 
The teaching of grammatical terms takes the attention of both 
teacher and pupils from what is much more important at this stage 
—-practice in the use of good English or Dutch. At the same time 
the beginnings of grammar teaching may be made here—the re- 
cognising of various kinds of words by the work which they do and 
the learning of simple names by which they may be distinguished ; 
the division of sentences ; the gaining of such practical knowledge 
of concord, comparison, &c., as may reveal the conditions of clear 
and correct speech, 
The inductive method must from the outset be used in teaching. 
Examples of the kind of word under examination must be supplied 
in sentences, the children discovering from these the truth it is 
desired to teach. Afterwards they should state, as well as they are 
able, the discovered truth. It is only at a later stage, when they 
are left to work an exercise or answer a test question, that the de-
-P-A-G-E-177
164 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
ductive method, which argues from the general rule to the particular 
example, should be used. 
Even in Standard I children are quite able to recognise that the 
words in sentences given during oral composition or met with in 
reading have different work to do. It will be sufficient if here they 
learn to pick out in any reading lesson or oral sentence the nouns, 
and verbs. These should be spoken of for some time as naming- 
words and saying-words. The grammatical terms should not be 
introduced till later. 
Proper names will be the most easily recognised as names by 
children. The word “ proper ” need not be used till a considerably 
later stage, but, if-we bear in mind the fact that it is derived 
from the L. proprius=one’s own, and distinguish between a 
person’s, place’s or thing’s own name and that which belongs to 
a whole class, we shall be preparing the way for its intelligent 
introduction when the time for it comes. 
No set grammar “lessons ” should be given at this early stage. 
A few minutes taken at the end of the reading or oral composition 
‘lesson—sentences from the book or biackboard being used as the 
starting point—will be all that is necessary: The first talk may 
suitably follow a lesson in which a number of children’s names have 
occurred. Having drawn attention to these words and been told 
by the children what they are we might proceed as follows : 
(1) Questioning to obtain a number of Proper Names : 
What is your name? Your sister’s name? Your brother’s 
name? ‘The name of the girl next you? Of the boy at 
the top of the class? At the bottom of it? Of the girl 
nearest to me ? 
The names, as given, should be written one under the other, 
on the blackboard. 
(2) Requiring of a given number of such names : 
Give me the names of three boys in the class. Of three girls. 
Of three children you have heard or read about in a story 
(Cinderella, Jack Horner, Tom Thumb). 
These also should be written on the blackboard.
-P-A-G-E-178
+ 
  The Teaching of Grammar 165 
(3) Furnishing of sentences containing such names : 
Writing on the blackboard such sentences as : 
Milly stands next to me, and Janie next to her. 
Jack, Tom, Edward, and Willie sit together. 
Mary and Fanny are talking to each other. 
We may ask the children to pick out the names in these 
sentences. They should be written under the others. 
(4) Giving of Test from Readers : 
Asking individual children round the class to pick out from a 
chosen page in their readers such names as occur, we 
should add these also to the blackboard list. We should 
not, in an endeavour to help them, suggest that they look 
for words beginning with a capital letter. The capital 
initials will be noted later in a proper time and way. 
(5) Systematising : 
Calling for attention, we may point to the column of names on the 
blackboard, and tell the children that all the words written 
on it are names and are therefore called name- (or naming) 
words. We should then have them read through ; should 
bid the children look at the first letter of each ; ask what 
kind of letter it is, and tell that a girl’s or boy’s own name 
is always written with a capital letter. Finally, we should 
bid the class repeat : 
Many words are name-words. 
A boy’s or girl's own name is written with a capital. 
Later, common nouns must be dealt with. It must be shown 
that there are names which do not belong only to one person, place 
or thing. The transition may be made very easily from the names 
of individuals to the common names boy, girl, teacher, father, 
mother. Abstract nouns, which would give more difficulty to 
young children, need not be introduced at this stage, for no one will 
expect such young children to be able to classify all nouns. It will 
be enough if they realise that among the many words used in speech 
some are name-words. If, however, it is thought advisable to deal 
with them the use of the word quality, which can have no meaning 
for the children, must be avoided, e.g. in “‘ He was tempted by the
-P-A-G-E-179
166 The School, the Child and the Teacher 
sweetness of the fruit” we should rather say that sweetness is the 
name of that which makes the fruit pleasant to taste. 
The verb, as the saying-word, should be taught in a similar 
inductive manner, the children being led to discover—through a 
sufficiency of examples—that in every completely expressed thought 
they speak or read, there is one word at least which says what some 
person or thing does or is, Distinctions need not be pursued further 
at this point, except to show reason for changes of form actually 
occurring in examples. Such concord as exists between verbs and 
their subjects must be taught at this stage through use without 
attempt at explanation. Vulgarisms as, for example, “‘ He done 
it,” “ She come with me,” must simply be corrected: every time they 
occur, 
Accompanying these talks on the work of words should be others 
on the parts of the sentence. The children should learn to distin- 
guish the naming part and the saying part, and in the latter to 
separate the verb from the words completing its meaning. They 
might then have exercises in picking out subject-nouns and object- 
nouns, though these terms should not be used. “The noun in the 
naming part ” and “ the noun in the saying part ” will serve instead. 
If by the end of the second standard year the children havelearnt 
to recognise nouns and verbs in a sentence and become familiar 
with the practical use of these two parts of speech we may be well 
satisfied. 
Pronouns (personal), as words used to avoid the repeating of 
nouns; adjectives; in conjunction with nouns, and adverbs, in 
conjunction with verbs, should be the new parts of speech dealt 
with in Standard III. While the learning of the table of personal 
pronouns is too often an exercise without interest or value, this 
part of speech yields opportunity for enjoyable lessons, by the 
inductive method, after which the children will be able to write 
out the pronouns in tabular form for themselves and find pleasure 
in doing so. 
A first lesson should be given to show the reason for the name 
pronoun. Suggestions follow : 
I. Examples : 
Write on the blackboard a paragraph of six or eight lines in| 
which—-no pronouns being used—the same nouns recw 
with irritating frequency. Bid the class read it. Ask i
-P-A-G-E-180
The Teaching of Grammar 167 
the paragraph sounds well. What is wrong with-it ? 
How may it be put right ? 
In response to the children’s suggestions draw a chalk line 
through the too frequently repeated nouns, writing the 
correct pronouns above. Bid the children re-read the 
sentence. 
Il. Examination : 
Lead the children to see that in each case another—generally 
speaking, a smaller—word has been used fora name. We 
might call these words for-names. We don’t do that, but 
we call them pro-nouns, which means exactly the same 
thing. Tell that the word pronoun is taken from the 
Latin language, which was at one time very largely used 
by English people. 
WI. Exercises : 
Give exercises such as the following: 
(x) To find and write down the pronouns in a number of sen- 
tences written on the blackboard. 
(2) To tell the pronouns in a number of prose and verse passages 
and to name the nouns for which they stand. 
(3) To write down the pronouns from a given passage in the 
standard reader, writing after each the noun for which it. 
stands. 
In a second lesson the children should be led to notice the 
varying forms of pronouns and discover what governs the change of 
form. The lesson may be taken somewhat as follows : 
Write on the blackboard some such incomplete sentence as : 
——— came to school yesterday and sister came with ——. 
Ask Tom (or some other boy) to read the sentence, putting in 
the pronouns that stand for his own name (when he is speak- 
ing) before came and sister and after with. Ask Mary to do the 
same. 
(x) Tom \" came to school yesterday and my sister came 
Mary with me. 
Then bid one child tell Tom what he and his sister did yesterday 
and another tell Mary.  
-P-A-G-E-181
168 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
(2) Fanny to haan | You came to school yesterday and your 
Jack to Mary sister came with you. 
Bid one child tell the class what Tom and his sister and a 
second what Mary and her sister did yesterday, while a third tells 
the same thing of Tom’s dog, using master for sister. . 
(3) Susie of Tom He came to school yesterday and his 
sister came with him. 
Willie of Mary | She came to school yesterday and her 
sister came with her. 
Jim of Tom’s dog} It came to school yesterday and its 
master came with it. 
Write the sentences on the blackboard, as given, underlining 
the pronouns. 
Point out that in (x) the pronouns were used for the names of 
Tom and Mary, who were the persons speaking. Tell that the 
person speaking is called the First Person, and write the pronouns 
as below. Similarly, point out that the pronouns in (2) were used 
for the names of Tom and Mary when they were spoken to by Jack 
and Fanny. Tell that the person spoken to is called the Second 
Person, and copy the three forms into the table under those of the 
ist person. 
Point out further that the pronouns in (3) were used of Tom 
and Mary and of Tom’s dog when they were the persons and 
animal spoken about. Tell that the persons (animals or things) 
spoken about are said to be the Third Person. Bid the children 
notice that in the 3rd person the pronoun takes different forms 
when used for Tom’s, Mary’s, and the dog’s names respectively. 
Tell that this is because Tom is a boy, Mary a girl, and the dog not 
a person at all, but an animal. Bid them notice that it is only 
in the grd person that any change is made. 
In the Before In the Naming Part.  aNound Saying Part. 
First (or ist) Person— I my me 
Second (or 2nd) Person— you your you 
(a he his him 
Third (or 3rd) Person— (b) {or her her 
(6) it its it 
1 For the sake of brevity. In the lesson itself we should explain that this 
noun is the name of some thing belonging to the person (animal or thing) for 
whom (or which) the pronoun in the naming part stands.
-P-A-G-E-182
_ The Teaching of Grammar 169 
Call the attention of the children to the table written during 
the lesson. Bid them notice the changes of form. 
Close the lesson with a few oral exercises in telling—or supplying 
—pronouns in the 1st, znd, and 3rd person, in the naming part, 
before a noun, and in the saying part. 
A third lesson should deal with the plural forms similarly. 
Numerous exercises on both singular and plural forms should then 
be given both orally and in written form. 
The adjective should next be taught, always in close connection 
with the noun, its function, not its form, being especially insisted 
on. When numerous sentences have been dealt with orally and 
on the blackboard, the children should be set to pick out adjectives 
from their readers, telling in the case of each what work they do. 
A lesson should be given to distinguishing predicative and epithetical 
adjectives.1 
Teaching on the adverb, (in conjunction, of course, with the 
verb) should follow, function again being emphasized. The adver- 
bial phrase developed from the adverb—e.g. immediately, at once, 
at that very moment—should receive preliminary oral treatment. 
Previous teaching on the noun should be extended ; the kinds 
of nouns, just touched upon in the earlier standards, being fully 
treated. Later they should be picked out of actual sentences made 
in oral composition lessons or met with in reading. 
In sentence work the relations between the parts—the naming 
part, the saying part, and the completion and extension of the 
saying part—should be brought out more clearly. For convenience’ 
sake the terms subject, predicate, object, and extension should now 
be introduced, the children by this time being old enough to dis- 
card the easier but more roundabout expressions. Different forms 
taken by the subject and object should also now be studied, the 
chief word in each, round which the other words group themselves, 
being always discovered and distinguished as the subject word and 
object word respectively. 
1 The new terminology—from the Report of the Joint Committee on 
Grammatical Terminology—~is used throughout this chapter because, how- 
ever great the trouble of making the change, the necessity for uniformity 
demands that it shall be made. The pamphlet (price 9a.) on the subject 
should be bought and studied and the suggested terms brought into use as 
quickly as possible, Grammar books which use it exclusively are now obtain- 
able. Among these may be mentioned Zhe Beginner's English Grammar, 
F. W. and E, Harrison (15. 6¢. Longmans).
-P-A-G-E-183
170 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
In Standard IV the more formal] study of grammar should begin 
and the syllabus of work be considerably extended. Of this class 
the full analysis and parsing of simple sentences should be required. 
This will necessitate the recognition of adverb phrases which extend 
the predicate. The preliminary oral work in adverb phrases in 
Standard III will have prepared the children for this advance, 
In all teaching and testing of analysis it will be necessary for us 
to bear in mind, that it is not as a formal exercise valuable in itself, 
that it finds a place in the elementary school course. Its value lies 
in. its enabling the children to gain such insight into the construc- 
tion of sentences as will help them to see the meaning of passages 
where it has become obscured through a departure from the usual 
order of sentence parts. Such passages will be fairly common in 
the more advanced prose and poetry which, as upper standard 
children, they will be expected to read with the expression which 
shows understanding. We shall be well advised, therefore, if, 
instead of making up sentences for analysis or taking isolated 
passages from grammar books for the purpose, we look through the 
literary readers of the class, and choose from them such.sentences 
as will be made clearer by analysis. 
The remaining parts of speech to be dealt with are the preposi- 
tion, conjunction, and interjection. The last, of course, as its name 
. implies, is not a part of speech in the same sense as the others are. 
Its use in expressing emotion must be pointed out and the fact that 
this is its only function be emphasized, by showing that it may 
be taken from the sentence without interfering in any degree with 
the sense. The fact that some interjections (eg. Alas !=How 
sorry I am !) compress a whole sentence into one word should be 
pointed out. 
_ The work of conjunctions will be readily understood, though the 
tendency to confuse them with adverbs must be guarded against. 
The use in the new terminology of the term connective or link for 
all words—whether pronouns, adjectives, adverbs or conjunctions— 
used to connect clauses or sentences should be noted. | 
Most of what our pupils need to know about prepositions, they 
will have learnt from their use of them in speech and writing. The 
function of this part of speech is not easy to explain to children, 
yet some attempt to explain it must be made to avoid the alter- 
native of giving them lists of prepositions to learn, in order that 
they may be able subsequently to recognise them in parsing. The
-P-A-G-E-184
The Teaching of Grammar” ~ 171 
objections to the latter plan are that it makes form the ground of 
distinction between one part of speech and another instead of 
function, and that it tends to substitute mechanical methods for 
intelligent ones. The difficulty of the former is that it necessitates 
the use of the phrase “express the relation between,” which will 
not have much meaning for the pupils. However, Standard IV 
children should be able partly to understand abstract expression. 
If they are puzzled we must help them by reference to some better 
known example of “ relationship,” 
Further knowledge of the grammar of noun (and pronoun), 
verb, adjective and adverb will be required now, and lessons on the 
following should be given : 
Noun and Pronoun.—Inflexion—number and case; relative 
pronouns ; common mistakes in the use of pronouns. 
Verb.—Used transitively and intransitively ; infinitive mood ; 
passive voice (preliminary treatment) ; tense—present and past ; 
different forms of the predicate, e.g. 
(x) Part of the verb to be + noun or adjective. 
The stranger was a young girl. 
The river is muddy. 
(2) Verb used intransitively. 
The man in the doorway rose, 
(3) Verb used transitively + objects. 
I have finished my course. 
He gave me the apple. 
(4) Verb in passive voice + adverb equivalent. 
Correct use of shall and will, should and would ; common mis- 
takes in sequence. 
Adjective —Comparison ; adjectival clause. 
Adverb.—Adverbial phrase and clause, the types of clause being 
classified according to the new terminology. 
While full parsing of all parts of speech may be required of 
Standard IV children, it should be borne in mind that it is not in 
the making or remembering of minute classifications that the exer- 
cise has its value. Written parsing of words, when the details of 
their classification are so well known as to be set down mechanically, 
is sheer waste of time that should be given to other work. Only 
consider how much time is spent, for example, by a class of children
-P-A-G-E-185
172 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
parsing the word the which occurs in almost every sentence. Once 
children can parse the various parts of speech, the parsing of whole 
sentences should be stopped, and the only words given to be parsed 
should be those which have something unusual in their structure or 
function, Other useful exercises are such as direct attention to 
some particular point—requiring the pupils, for example, to pick 
out from a given page, and parse, some one part of speech alone. 
This will prevent merely mechanical work, 
The parts of speech and parts of the sentence having all been 
dealt with before the end of the Standard IV year, the work of the 
upper standards will be to go more fully into what has been pre- 
viously taught—to study the more difficult uses of some special 
forms of speech ; to complete the study of clauses begun in Standard 
IV; to learn to distinguish between complex and double and mul- 
tiple sentences ; to distinguish also co-ordinating and subordinating 
conjunctions, and to take up and pursue that interesting branch of 
grammatical study which is concerned with word derivation. 
For instance, the inflexions of the noun have been taught in 
Standards III and IV. In Standard V a lesson on the disappear- 
ance of case-endings in English and Dutch will be a suitable de- 
velopment. 
Formal lessons on the adjective and adverb phrase and clause 
should have been given in Standard IV. In Standard V lessons on 
the noun phrase and clause should follow. In preparation for these 
lessons we shall naturally refer back to our earlier ones on the en- 
largement of the subject and object, and in the course of them will 
need to deal with and distinguish between the verb infinite and the 
infinitive mood, the gerund (verb-noun) and participle (verb- 
adjective). 
. A lesson on subordinate clauses in general, considered func- 
tionally, should follow. 
A lesson on the uses of that will serve to bring together and 
systematise all that the pupils have learnt of these uses from time 
to time, as the different parts of speech have been dealt with. 
The further work on verbs will demand lessons on tense, especi- 
ally as tenses are used differently in Dutch and English. The 
tenses of the indicative (as given on p. 28 of the pamphlet on the 
new terminology) should be taught. ‘‘ Voice ” should now receive 
fuller and more formal treatment than in Standard IV. 
Word derivation is as much a subject for the upper standard

spelling lessons as for the grammar lessons, and suggestions have 
been made—in Chapter VI—as to the nature of the lessons required 
and the time at which they should be given. 
Tt may be said here that the small word-work handbooks which 
many educational firms publish will be found extremely useful in 
the teaching of prefixes, roots, and word-derivation generally, if 
thay are well-chosen and properly used. With regard to their choice, 
those which furnish lists of words merely, should be rejected in 
favour of such as treat them intelligently. With regard to their 
use, it must be borne in mind that the memorising of lists should 
always follow—never precede—the teaching which makes them 
intelligible. 
Standards VI and VII may be considered one class for this as 
for most other subjects. In analysis the pupils have studied the 
different parts of a sentence and the different kinds of phrases and 
clauses which go to make up sentences. They have still to learn to 
distinguish the different kinds of sentence which result from the 
combining of phrases and clauses. 
Under the new terminology previously referred to, these are 
classified as follows : 
(x) Simple Sentences—those containing only one predication. 
(2) Complex Sentences—those containing one main predication 
and one or more subordinate predications. (Note: These, in 
teaching, may be likened to a single tree with its branches, of a 
river with its tributaries—a whole with parts of relative import- 
ance interdependent upon each other.) 
(3) Double Sentences—those which consist of two co-ordinate 
parts. 
Multiple Sentences—those which consist of more than two 
co-ordinate parts. (Note: These again, hitherto called 
“ compound” sentences, may be likened to an avenue of trees— 
a whole composed of independent parts.) 
In connection with this classification of sentences lessons 
will be needed on the subordinating and co-ordinating conjunc- 
tions. 
At this stage the analysis of a fairly difficult passage, e.g. 
Milton’s Sonnet on His Blindness, should not be beyond our pupils. 
We should work out a number of such passages with them, that they
-P-A-G-E-187
174 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
may learn how to examine them with a view to discovering the 
relation of the various clauses in each sentence, before they are left 
to work such exercises by themselves. 
Types of sentences classified in accordance with the new ter- 
minology—viz.: (a) Statements. (4) Questions. (¢) Desires, in- 
cluding Commands, Requests, Entreaties, Wishes—should be dealt 
with in these last years, and noun clauses classified on the same 
principle. : : 
A lesson on noun, adjective and adverb clauses should bring 
into relation at this point former separate lessons on the three. 
Work on the parts of speech should be developed on similar 
‘lines. Lessons should be given on the 
Noun—Cases in English and Dutch—Nom., Voc., Acc., Dat., 
and Gen. 
Order of words as distinguishing case. 
The retained accusative. 
The noun absolute. 
Verb—Ordinary and continuous forms in English and Dutch. 
Sequence of. tenses. 
Subjunctive equivalents. 
In grammar, as’ in other language subjects, South African 
teachers meet with special difficulties owing to the fact that both 
English and Dutch are spoken in the country. For this reason, 
the grammatical analysis of speech is of special importance, since 
there is a strong tendency on the part of the pupils, as 
has been said in an earlier chapter, to misapply the usages of one 
language to the other. In this there lies a serious danger for both— 
a danger that neither may be accurately spoken. The danger 
exists in all bilingual countries. To. guard against it constant 
attention must be given to seeing that idiom is kept pure in each 
language, and teachers in South Africa need, therefore, a thorough 
knowledge of the idioms of English and Dutch. We must know 
precisely where the idioms and constructions of the two languages 
differ, and so be able to give our pupils the necessary warnings 
and guidance at these points. But itis not enough that we should 
be aware of incorrect uses. As teachers we must try to systema- 
tize our knowledge in order that we may know the best way 
to combat such uses in the speech and writing of our pupils.
-P-A-G-E-188
  I f 
The Teaching of Grammar 175 
The matter should receive the special attention necessary, both 
in grammar and composition lessons. The mistakes made will 
naturally be discovered in the pupils’ composition both oral and 
written, and for this reason should be systematically treated during 
correction of this. That part of the work, therefore, may be left 
for discussion in the following chapter. But grammar and com~- 
position are closely connected ; for, as has been suggested earlier in 
this chapter, grammar lessons should be chiefly given (especially in 
the case of the lower standards) to examining the children’s ordinary 
speech, and the sentences they make in oral and written composi- 
tions. During this examination 4 sharp look-out must be kept for 
errors resulting from the influence of the one language on the other— 
as, for example, the use of “is” with both singular and plural 
nouns owing to the fact that in Afrikaans there is only one form (is) 
for the two—and for misuse of auxiliaries (as in “ He can be killed ” 
when may or might should be used) and prepositions (as in “I am 
going home. Will you come with ?” where in English the pronoun 
“me” must follow the preposition. While, in class, correction of 
common errors in composition is directed to showing how they are 
wrong and how they may be put right, in grammar lessons the aim 
should be more especially to show why they are wrong, the reason 
being made apparent by reference to rules previously discovered 
by the pupils themselves. 
Thus the teaching both of grammar and composition will fulfil 
the purpose for which the subjects find a place in the curriculum— 
the former giving, through actual example, knowledge of the con- 
ditions of clear and correct speech, and the latter affording practice 
in the use of language orally and in writing.

CHAPTER VIII 
THE TEACHING OF COMPOSITION 
“Reading maketh a full man ; conference a ready man ; and writing an 
exact man. And therefore if a man write little, he had need have a great 
memory.”—BACON. 
“Children should be made often to tell a story of anything they know, 
and when they can tell stories pretty well, write them.”—Locke. 
“J urge, then, as the most pressing need of our schools in this matter, 
that a fairly good and appropriate style of composition be insisted upon in 
connection with all subjects, arithmetic, science, history, geography and the 
rest. Styles may differ; condensation and precision may be cultivated in 
arithmetic and science; copiousness and vividness in history and geography ; 
but we have no right whatever to accept really bad composition in any single 
subject... . 
“No number of specific lessons are sufficient to make children compose 
well, There must be a wealth of ideas linked to wealth of words, and this 
is scarcely possible except through copious reading. Once again, impression 
must precede expression. It is one thing ‘to have to say something’ and 
another ‘to have something to say.’”—F. H. Haywarp. 
In school usage the word composition has a narrowed meaning 
which is explained by its history as a school subject. For many 
years composition was not taught in public elementary schools till 
Standard V, in which class it began with the written reproduction 
by the pupils of a story read to them, and led up to essay and letter- 
writing in the higher standards. Thus, for some years, all school 
composition was written, and so the application of the word came 
to be restricted to the written reproduction of a story and to essay 
writing. 
When the subject was begun so late, little headway could be 
made in the remaining years of school life, and when the necessity 
of training children in the power of self-expression began to be more 
generally recognised, sentence building in the lower standards was 
177 - M
-P-A-G-E-191
178 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
introduced as a preparatory exercise. As young children write 
very laboriously, it was felt that more good would be done by their 
acquiring ease in speaking through much practice than by requiring 
them to write down the sentences built. 
Oral composition, so far as it means the early training of 
the power of speech, which must at first precede and afterwards 
keep pace with the teaching of reading, has been dealt with in 
Chapter IV. Here, it will be regarded more particularly as an 
exercise preparatory to the written composition of the later stan- 
dards, though even in the highest standard it should not be entirely 
given up. Its aim is to secure correct writing by first securing 
correct speaking—to secure grammatical and fluent composition 
through correct and easy speech. 
In order to do this we must continue the all-important work of 
relating observation and expression—seeing and saying—getting 
children to look carefully at objects and pictures both in and out 
of school, and to talk about them informally whenever opportunity 
occurs or can be made. From this it will appear that the teaching 
of composition must not be rigidly kept to cetain fixed half-hours 
marked on a time-table. There is, indeed, no subject of the school 
course which suffers more from such treatment. The reason is 
not far to seek. In language subjects generally, and in this ex- 
pressional one in particular, school and home influences are often 
at variance. The school work of one day is undone out of school 
before the next. Slipshod pronunciation, slovenly habits of speech, 
ugly and ungrammatical forms of expression are heard and copied 
at home and in the street, much more quickly than they can be 
corrected in class during the short half-hour or two in the week 
which the time-table allots to composition. In order to counteract 
the out-of-school tendency to faulty speech, where it exists, every 
lesson must be to some extent a composition lesson, and all possible 
aid must be got from such closely allied subjects as speech, reading, 
writing and grammar. 
But while it is customary now to take oral composition in 
the lower standards and written in the upper, we must be on our 
guard against thinking of them as two separate subjects. They 
are not two subjects, but one, and the only reason for making such 
a division between them lies in the fact that, while the exercise must 
begin with the beginning of school life, if any ease in speech and 
writing is to be gained before school life is over, writing, as has been
-P-A-G-E-192
The Teaching of Composition 179 
said, is a very laborious matter for young children, who would make 
little progress if they had to write down all the sentences they 
composed. 
. How much the later written work is dependent on the earlier 
oral exercises for its success, finds very remarkable proof in the 
recent reports of inspectors. One after another bears testimony to 
the great improvement in upper standard composition since the in- 
troduction of oral sentence-building into the syllabus of the lower 
standards. 
But in one particular it is recognised that there is a danger of 
the oral exercises failing to prepare the children for their later task 
of writing compositions, Unless the sentence-forming of the chil- 
dren is supplemented by blackboard work on the part of the teacher, 
the sentences will tend to be very disconnected, while in the upper 
standards continuous composition is required. The scheme of oral 
composition adopted in the lower standards must make provision 
for the bridging of this gulf, or its full value will not be felt. In 
Germany, France and America it is a common practice to call upon 
some pupil to come out at the beginning of a lesson and give a 
continuous account of the last lesson in the same subject. In these 
countries, we are told, children are taught to “ think and speak on 
their feet without losing their heads’? ; and, consequently, they 
speak with a freedom and correctness which the children in our 
schools often lack. Another exercise directed to the same purpose 
is to give the children a story to read by themselves and next day 
to ask one of them to tell it in his own words, and by the help of 
others in the class to get the whole story told in continuous narrative. 
Yet another plan is to make subjects taken from home and school 
life furnish material for oral and written composition. Thus in 
one school a boy described the woodwork and other exercises of 
the manual department, and at the close of the term gave a sum- 
mary of the whole, illustrated by drawings. Nature-study and 
history may be largely drawn upon for subjects for oral composition, 
the themes being discussed in class with the aim of obtaining 
oral fluency in simple narrative and description. Where history 
is taken for the material, a topic rather than a page or a chapter 
should be set for preparation—the object being “not information 
but training in self-instruction,” which may have its effect in 
improved self-expression. 
Oral composition, thus used, forms a link between private study
-P-A-G-E-193
180 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
and the written exercise which follows it as a test. In study the 
mind of the child is employed in trying to make things clear to him- 
self, while in written reproduction he must address himself to the 
task of making his thoughts clear to someone else. In oral com- 
position the child may be helped to convey his ideas more clearly 
by having them made clearer to himself. By making him follow a 
line of thought which we have previously laid down, we may keep 
him from wandering from the point and get him to fix his mind on 
what is essential to the subject. 
We must never forget that in composition, which is the con- 
tinuous expression of thought in words, the thought expressed is 
to be the child’s own—not ours, and not that of some model child 
existing in our own mind. Subjects must be sought, then, in the 
realm of his interests. We have already found that these are so 
wide that no lack of topics need be feared. In the Sub-Standards, 
as has been said, the subjects of conversation should be present 
before the class in the form of animals, objects or pictures, and this 
stimulation of thought by sight should be continued from time to 
time, as opportunity can be made, in the lower standards. 
The work is of two kinds—informal and formal. That which 
is informal is connected with the greetings between us and our 
pupils ; with our orders, which should always be carefully and cor- 
rectly worded ; with answers to questions, which must always 
be complete ; and with the ordinary courtesies of school life. In 
particular it bears upon reading and recitation lessons, the children 
being required to talk about stories and poems they have read, to 
answer questions on meanings, and to give, at the end of it, in con- 
tinuous narrative, an account of a lesson read. Such informal 
work should be continued throughout the school course, from the 
Sub-Standards to the highest class. Of senior pupils a para- 
phrase of matter read should occasionally be required. 
The formal work should deal with both oral and written com- 
position even in the lower standards. In junior classes the oral 
work should include talks about familiar things, about the objects 
used in observation lessons and others in the classroom or seen 
from it, and about the children’s homes and doings. It should 
include, also, talks about unfamiliar things, pictures being used in 
this branch of the work as an aid to conversation. Use should be 
made of stories in two ways, They should be told by the teacher 
and retold by the children, and they should also be read by the
-P-A-G-E-194
The Teaching of Composition 181 
children and then told in their own words. Nursery tales will be 
most suitable for this purpose in the Sub-Standards and Standard I. 
In Standards II and III stories which bring in descriptions of dis- 
tant lands and their inhabitants, and others about famous men and 
women in history should take their place. In choosing the latter, 
care must be exercised and the children’s interests studied. Such 
characters as Richard the Lion-Heart, Joan of Arc, and Piet Uys 
are suitable at this stage. Such as Henry II and Becket, Wolsey, 
William of Orange and Sir George Grey should be left till later years. 
Occasionally the fishing of an incomplete story should be 
asked of the children, as the cultivation of originality is one of 
our aims. 
Written work in these classes should reproduce the sentences 
formed orally. In connection with this, lessons on punctuation 
will be necessary. The use of capitals, full stop, comma, quotation 
and question marks should be mastered by the children before the 
end of Standard III. 
In senior classes the talks on familiar and unfamiliar things 
should be given up in favour of others about the pupils’ experiences 
—as, for instance, an excursion, a holiday journey or visit, life on 
a farm and in a town. Continuous narrative, giving an account of 
something read in literary or historical readers, or learnt in geo- 
graphy or nature lessons ; or of something studied, as, for example, 
a picture, should be required. Private reading and current events 
should also be made to afford material for continuous oral narra- 
tive, and later, written compositions. Lessons on the choice of the 
right word, and on the use of simile and metaphor, should be given. 
Written work should include letter-writing, which will neces- 
sitate lessons on arrangement ; narrative, story or description, 
demanding teaching on paragraphs and on direct and indirect 
forms, and essay-writing requiring the study of structure. Two 
valuable forms of exercise at this period are the summarising of . 
passages, chapters or narratives, and the expansion of brief accounts. 
Further lessons will be required—on the remaining punctuation 
marks, on connections and relatives, and on spelling. 
The preceding paragraphs briefly outline a course of composi- 
tion for junior and senior scholars respectively. It will be advis- 
able now, to see how this scheme may be fitted to the requirements 
for the various standards, and to give such suggestions for the carry- 
ing out of it as may seem necessary.

182. The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
Sub-Standards : The repetition of suitable nursery rhymes and 
recitation of children’s poems; easy oral exercises; talks about 
familiar things (including natural objects); children’s stories from 
Grimm and Hans Andersen. . 
All this work has been. dealt with in sufficient detail in the 
chapter on the cultivation of speech. 
Standard I: Easy oral exercises as in the Sub-Standards, with 
the addition of talks about unfamiliar things : 
Writing of short sentences made in oral work. 
Teaching on the use of capitals and the full stop. 
The following are suitable exercises : 
A. The forming of short sentences each expressing one single idea : 
() On familiar things : The children’s books, slates and pencils, 
things used at table, and the toys they play with, are suitable 
subjects. 
(2) On unfamiliar things: Occasionally it may be found neces- 
sary to prompt the children’s thoughts by means of questions, 
This should not, however, always be done, and not, as a rule, till 
the children’s thoughts seem exhausted. A customary stimulation 
soon fails to have any result. Questioning is sometimes useful 
as a guide to the order of the spoken thoughts. As the children 
are learning to see and say, some training in seeing and saying in 
order is needed. 
In the same way lessons should be taken, with occasional writing 
of sentences, on nature subjects, pictures, playthings and games. 
The method has been sufficiently indicated in Chapter IV. .Some 
development in the direction of formalising the children’s sentences 
should here be seen, the lesson being not so much in the nature of 
an informal unbroken talk. The sentences, at this stage, should 
receive separate consideration and be “ arranged”’—the arrange- 
ment, as has been said, being given form on the blackboard. The 
sentences written should be occasionally copied by the children. 
B. The telling of a story in continuous oral narrative : 
Note: Occasionally, again, parts of the story should be written, 
for the necessary merging of oral into written composition at a 
later stage, must be constantly kept in view. In this written work 
some knowledge of punctuation will be needed.
-P-A-G-E-196
  The Teaching of Composition 183 
Earlier writing lessons will have familiarised the children with 
the use of full stops and capital letters ; but there will have been 
no attempt, hitherto, to teach the rules governing their use. This 
teaching should now be given with regard to (x) the formation of a 
sentence ; (2) the use of the full stop, and of a capital letter after it. 
Use of the full stop : 
An oral lesson on this sign might open with an informal talk 
on use, rule, custom, for punctuation marks are the customary signs 
used in writing to make it easy to read what has been written. 
When a few common customs have been cited, reference should be 
made to the customs observed in writing, the word rule being 
brought in at this point. The rules, or customs, of good writing are 
not easy to remember, so that it is necessary to pay great atten- 
tion to what is said about them, and to be very careful to practise 
them in every written exercise. 
Enumerate some of the customs of writing. The use, for ex- 
ample, of capital I and the beginning of the names of the days of 
the week with a capital letter. Ask the children to mention others, 
Earlier lessons should have familiarised them with the use of 
capitals for the initial letters of personal and place names, etc. 
Turn towards the children the side of a blackboard on which 
you have previously copied clearly a passage from a book without 
putting in any stops. Bid the children read the passage. They 
will no doubt only succeed in stumbling through it. Ask them 
why they find it harder to read than a piece from their books. 
You will probably be told: “Because there are no stops,” for the 
children, at this age, will know the name given to the little marks 
which divide up reading matter. Show how the absence of these 
stops makes it difficult to see the meaning of what was written. 
Next bid the children find out where stops are most badly needed, 
and mark the divisions by vertical lines, Bid them examine the 
passage again, and notice where these occur—at the end of each com- 
plete sentence. Point out that the vertical lines took some time tio 
draw and, where not carefully made, spoilt the look of the writing, 
For this reason sentences are not separated by vertical lines in 
writing and printing, but by a mark that can be made more quickly 
and perfectly. Ask a child to come and make the customary 
mark on the blackboard. Ask what it is called—for the children, 
of course, know. Help them to see why it is called a full stop.
-P-A-G-E-197
184 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
Direct attention again to the passage on the blackboard where, 
although the full stops have been entered, the initial letters of the 
words following them are “small” and not “ capital.” ' Ask the 
children—again their experience of reading books will enable them 
to answer—if the passage looks right. Why not? ‘Then, having 
received the correct answer, state that it is customary, or a rule, in 
writing to begin every word that follows a full stop with a capital 
letter. In other words: Every sentence should begin with a capital 
letter. 
Other uses of capitals should be discovered by the children 
through the examination of sentences which contain examples 
of such uses; as, for instance, for the first word of every line 
of poetry (which may be pointed out during the reading or 
saying of poetry); for the first letter of titles; for the first 
word of every direct quotation—taught in connection with quota- 
tion marks; for the word “O” standing alone, and for proper 
nouns. 
It is assumed that the need for capitals in the case of personal 
and family names, of the days of the week and the months of 
the year, and of place names, will have been discovered incident- 
ally in the course of reading and writing lessons. The frequency 
of their recurrence in these cases should impress them on the 
mind. 
The need for capitals in all these cases will require emphasizing 
again and again. It is one thing to know the rules sufficiently to. be 
able to answer correctly about them, as many children can and do, 
and quite another for the knowledge to have merged into a habit 
of writing them, where required, without any need for stopping to 
think. The omission or misuse of capitals is a marked feature of 
the writing of South African pupils and students, and it is time 
that the reproach was rolled away. Both faults, of course, are 
owing in part to a difference of usage in English and Dutch (for 
example, the “ proper ” adjective is written with a capital in English, 
but not in Dutch (cp. “English language ” with “ engelse taal”), 
but it is owing also in part to the fact that correct usage has not 
been systematically taught in either language. 
Standard II.—Oral exercises as in Standard I, but using stories 
read in class or by the children privately ; short descriptions in 
connection with geography lessons and nature work.
-P-A-G-E-198
ih, See 
  Net The Teaching of Composition 185 
Written work as in Standard I. 
Teaching on the use of the comma and quotation marks. 
Use of quotation marks.—The fact that quotation marks are 
used to enclose every unbroken “ direct” quotation and every 
part of a broken one, may be taught through some poem or prose 
passages containing many. The children should be asked such 
questions as “Who is speaking?” “What does he say?” 
“ What is the first word he says?” “ Which is the last?” They 
might ‘then be told to copy the speech, from book or board, carefully 
entering all marks or signs made near the words, and so on through- 
out the poem. At the end the rule should be discovered, namely, 
that when the exact words of any one speaking are told, the words 
are enclosed in commas—two before the first one, and two after 
the last one. (The use of single inverted commas, -to mark a 
quotation within a quotation, will not be taught till met with in 
the children’s reading, nor will the use of quotation marks where 
the quotation runs through several paragraphs.) The children will 
be interested in discovering that the first two are turned upside 
down, but the name of inverted commas should not be given till 
much later—say Standard 1V. An exercise might then be given, in 
another poem or prose passage, the children being set first to study 
the quotation marks (though this name-for them need not be used), 
then to copy the passage without them, and finally to enter them 
from memory. 
Broken quotations might be treated separately, a conversational 
prose passage from one of the Just So Stories, Water Babies, or 
Alice in Wonderland being used to exemplify them. 
Note: Excellent illustrative examples of all this work are given 
in The Mother Tongue, Book I—American authors, Arnold and 
Kittredge—adapted for use in English schools, by J. W. Adamson. 
Publishers: Ginn & Company. An appendix gives in brief form 
rules for the use of punctuation marks and capital letters. 
These will be found very useful for reference, but for the chil- 
dren’s study and practice, the method indicated should be followed. 
They should not be required to memorise the summary. 
Standard III.—Oral exercises as in Standard IJ, with reproduc- 
tions also, of a story read by the teacher, and of short descriptions 
of things seen or observed,

Writing of sentences made orally, and of simple letters. . 
Teaching on the use of question marks and notes of exclamation. 
Suitable exercises for this division are— 
A. The continuous, oral narrating of a story told or read ; the 
recapitulating of a lesson previously given ; the describing of an ex- 
periment performed or a scene witnessed. 
B. The writing of (1) short, simple, one-paragraph stories (told 
by the teacher), including stories of great men. (Historical pictures to 
be used occasionally.) (2) Short, original, one-paragraph stories. 
Narrative is the easiest form of continuous composition and, 
therefore, the one with which that exercise should begin. We shall 
find the average Standard III child quite capable of reproducing 
short, one-paragraph stories that have been read or told him. This 
is partly because there is in most anecdotes a picture element which 
is an aid to memory, but chiefly because the incident unfolds itself 
in a way that arranges for the writer the order of its reproduction. 
Children have great difficulty in giving a well-ordered account of 
anything. Their thoughts are fragmentary and confused, and their 
speech and writing, therefore, cannot be connected and clear. 
Thus the short story which carries its own order with it solves for 
young people the problem of what to tell next, 
There is an objection to the reading of stories for reproduction. 
Children are apt to pay too much attention to the words of the 
book ; and, in the effort to remember these for reproduction, forget 
to follow the story itself. The objection tends to disappear when 
the story is ‘old, for the words are usually altered in the second 
telling. It is advisable, therefore, to give up reading in favour 
of telling stories for reproduction as soon as we have trained our- 
selves to tell them clearly. Meanwhile it will be better to let the 
children hear a story some little time before they have to reproduce 
it; and always at the time of reading it to warn them to listen 
to the story and not to the words. 
While invention demands more than narrative, the writer 
having to supply both matter and words, this is not an extra diffi- 
culty to children of inventive mind, Some children are naturally 
inventive, and these generally show the power of story-weaving, 
when opportunity is given them, at a very early age, for imagina-
-P-A-G-E-200

tion is then very vivid. Mrs. Bryant, in her book of Stortes to Tell 
to Children, quotes one made up by a “ very little boy ” : 
“Once upon a time there was a little boy, and he wanted to bea 
cock-a-doo-dle-doo. So he was a cock-a-doo-dle-doo. And he 
wanted to fly up into the sky. So he did fly up into the sky. And 
he wanted to get wings and a tail. So he did get some wings and 
a tail,” 
Invention, then, is quite a suitable exercise for young children, 
and the writing of short original stories may be asked of Standard 
III. The response will be best when the children have read 
and heard and told many stories, and have had good training in 
oral composition in Standards I and II. Where these conditions 
do not exist we shall have to be prepared to give help at first. We 
might do so by telling the children stories which we ourselves have 
made up; and encouraging them to make an attempt themselves 
after hearing these. We might also let them have suggestive 
picture cards in front of them while thinking out a.story. 
C. The writing of a short, simple letter 
Letter-writing, at this stage, will differ somewhat from that 
suggested in the chapter on writing. There the purpose of the 
exercise was simply to emphasize the fact that writing is a means 
of communicating thought. . Here, it is to improve the matter and 
style of communication. As a writing exercise, therefore, the letter 
might be copied or written without such particular attention to 
idea and form of expressions as must be given to these when it is 
dealt with as a composition exercise. 
Suggestions for treatment follow : 
The lesson proper may be led up to by conversations—in which 
the children’s own knowledge is utilised—on the post office and the 
postal service—mail trains, post carts, postmen and postage stamps. 
One of the children, for example, may be asked to describe orally 
the post office in his own town or village—its situation and the 
building itself. Others in turn may be asked whether they have 
ever posted a letter? How they did it? Whether they ever 
received a letter? How it came to them? Whether the sender 
pays anything and how? How much must be paid for sending a 
letter from Capetown to Pretoria ? How the letter goes ?
-P-A-G-E-201
188 The School, -the Child, and the Teacher 
Before the next lesson an imagined, model letter from one child 
to another should be written on the blackboard, and at the begin- 
ning of the lesson put before the class, the children being told to 
copy it carefully into their composition books. As soon as the 
letter is copied the children should be told to read it through, and 
then be asked to tell what news it carries from the sender to the 
receiver. 
A third lesson should give the formal teaching necessary at 
this stage. The children should have their books open at the page 
oa which they copied the letter and the blackboard copy should 
be before them again for reference. It might be taken as follows : 
Ask the children the purpose of a letter—-To carry news or mes- 
sages fromthe writer to someone else. Tell them that every letter 
should show: (1) Where it was written, (2) when it was written, 
(3) to whom it was written, and (4) by whom it was written. Direct 
them to study the letter in front of them, and find out these par- 
ticulars from it. 
Then tell that letters are generally written in the same form, 
their parts being arranged according to rule ; and direct them once 
more to study this form and these parts in the letter before them. 
Tell that the first part of the letter, which tells where and when 
it was written, is known as the Heading. Draw attention to the 
position of the heading in their model letter and to the insetting to 
the right of each successive line of it. Having noted the way in 
which the date is expressed, point out the advantage of 8th 
March 1913 over March 8th, 1913, where the figures marking the 
day and those marking the year come together and are consequently 
less easy to read. 
Tell that the second part of the letter, which tells to whom 
it was written, is called the Greeting. Tell also that it changes 
with the nature of the letter and with the relation existing between 
sender and receiver. While in business letters or letters to strangers 
it is formal and dignified, in social letters, like the one before 
them, it is friendly and informal. 
Tell that the main part of the letter, which conveys the news 
or message, is called the Body of the Letter,and that the rules for 
writing this must be learnt gradually from the study and. writing 
of many letters. 
Tell that the last parts of a letter are the Ending and the 
Signature, which show the relation between the writer and the
-P-A-G-E-202
|   The Teaching of Composition 189 
person written to, and give the name of the former. Bid the chil- 
dren note the form of the Ending and Signature in their model 
letter, and how, as in the Heading, the successive lines are inset 
to the right. Tell that it is customary in business and other im- 
portant communications to write the name and address of the 
person to whom the letter is written. 
Ask what must be done with a letter before it is posted. It 
must be folded and put in an envelope, which must be addressed 
in a clear handwriting. Draw the shape of an envelope on the 
blackboard, and write a name and address within it, pomting out 
that, again, as in the Heading and the Ending, and Signature, each 
successive line is inset a little to the right. Tell that the address 
should neither be written right up in the left top corner, nor right 
down in the right bottom corner, nor spread all over the envelope. 
Show that none of these errors of style are seen in the model enve~ 
lope you have addressed for them. 
Note: In a subsequent lesson distribute letter-paper and 
envelopes, and give the children practice in folding the one to a 
convenient size and addressing the other. Later, children should 
be allowed to write “‘ real ” letters in school, and, after addressing 
the envelope, to seal, stamp and post them. 
BLACKBOARD SCHEME 
Letter-writing 
A letter has several parts : 
1. The Heading—showing where and when it was written, 
2. The Greeting—showing to whom it was written. 
3. The Body of the Letier—conveying news or messages. 
4. The Ending and Signature—showing the name of the writer 
and his relation to the person written to. 
Use of question marks.—The substitution of the question mark 
for a full stop at the end of a sentence which, instead of making a 
statement, asks a question, should be taught through a number of 
examples found in the class readers. Attention should be drawn 
to the ear-like shape of this mark, and several children be brought 
out to make it on the blackboard. The children should then be 
told to ask questions and afterwards to write them. Later a 
“question game” might be devised. For example, a child might
-P-A-G-E-203
190 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
be brought out and told to think of some object in the room. 
He should tell the children that he has done so, and bid them 
write on their slates a question asking what he has thought of— 
e.g. Is it the door? Is it the floor? Is it the table? In every 
case the note of interrogation must close the question. When the 
“thinker ” goes round the class to read the questions, he should 
give.no mark to those who have forgotten it. 
Use of the exclamation mark.—From a number of examples, 
again, it should be found that this is used after words, phrases or 
sentences which express some sudden feeling, such as pleasure, 
anger, sorrow, fear, surprise, &c. Further examples should be 
given for study, and-—after practice in making the mark—others, 
again, be required of the children. It should be pointed out, too, 
that where the exclamation is a word or phrase, the sentence in 
which it occurs ends with a full stop or question mark, as required, 
the exclamation mark being put where the exclamation ends. 
This must, not, however, be told, but shown in a sufficient number 
of examples. 
Standard 1V.—Oral exercises as in Standard III, but more stories 
of great men (using historical pictures occasionally); and more 
use of stories and other narratives read by the children themselves ; 
the expansion or completion of an outline story. 
Written reproduction of a short story, or description read by 
the teacher ; simple letter-writing. 
Teaching on “ direct”? and “indirect ” narrative and simple 
paragraph. 
Some of the stories chosen for reproduction by this class may 
very suitably be taken from classical fiction in which incidents in 
childhood occur—stories of Tom and little Ellie, for instance, from 
Water Babies, of Alice in Wonderland, of Tom and Maggie Tulliver 
from The Mill on the Floss, of Little Nell from The Old Curiosity 
Shop, of David Copperfield and of Oliver Twist. In addition, 
many fables may be used for the purpose, while a prose version of a 
poem such as The Loss of the Royal George or The Inchcape Rock may 
be asked for. 
Suggestions for the treatment of such stories are given below. 
Tell the story after having prepared it carefully with regard 
to choice of words and arrangement of sentences. Make your
-P-A-G-E-204
  eel 8 mr The Teaching of Composition 191 
narrative as vivid as possible in the effort to call up in the chil- 
dren’s minds pictures of the various scenes and events of the 
story. 
Discuss the story with the class, giving the children an oppor- 
tunity both to ask questions about and to express their opinion 
on it. 
Ask one of the children to tell the story in his own words. 
Interrupt him as little as possible, as he may lose the thread of 
his story. An easy flow of language in narration is required at 
this point.. If you feel that it will be an advantage, ask another 
child to tell the story over again. 
Require the story sentence by sentence of the members of the 
class. Subject such sentences as require it to discussion, then 
write on the blackboard the final form agreed upon as best. Rules 
of sentence-building and joining should be introduced incidentally 
at this point, if the sentences given exemplify or violate them. 
Give particular attention in this stage of the lesson to the com- 
bining of simple sentences into double and multiple or complex 
ones, pointing out where they may be used with advantage, and 
where, on the other hand—as, for instance, to give emphasis or 
express haste—a succession of short simple sentences is demanded. ' 
Bid the children read through the completed story from the 
blackboard. Being the reproduction of many minds, it will pro- 
bably not read very smoothly. Get the children to compare it 
with their remembrance of the story as told, and to try to express 
the difference between the two versions. Take their suggestions 
for removing any jerkiness of style that exists. Avoid formal 
grammatical expressions in this work, trusting to example rather 
than rule, 
When several stories have been treated in this way help should 
be gradually withdrawn. The detailed blackboard treatment of 
sentences and subsequent re-reading and re-writing should be 
omitted first ; then the oral reproduction by individuals and the 
general class discussion. Finally, the written reproduction by the 
children should follow straight upon the telling of the story. 
Standard V.—Oral exercises on what the pupils have read, 
have heard read, or have experienced. Completion and expansion 
of story outlines. 
Note,—Suitable material from historical, geographical and
-P-A-G-E-205
192 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
nature-study readers, and from the pupils’ private reading should 
be used for the purpose of these exercises. 
Short written descriptions or letters based on the oral work ; 
business letters. — 
Teaching on arrangement and paragraphing. 
In this standard development will be expected both in form and 
matter—greater ease and refinement of style being required, and a 
wider range of subjects and exercises. The exercises suggested for 
Standards ITI and IV should be continued and developed as follows : 
A. In oral narrative, greater fluency and nicety of expression 
applied to the description of a scene, picture or incident. 
B. In story-telling, the reproduction of full narratives requiring 
more than one paragraph—that is, introducing and developing more 
than one idea; the expanding of a given outline of a story ; the 
writing of an original ending to a story told “so far” ; the writing 
of a story suggested by another, e.g., What would have happened 
if Tom in Water Babies had been caught in Ellie’s room; the 
development of a proverb into a story ; the writing of an original 
story of greater length. 
C. In letter-writing, greater length, advance in subject matter 
in keeping with the children’s mental development ; more graces 
of style. Call should now be made on the imagination in this 
exercise, and such letters as the following be asked for—a letter of 
complaint from a doll to her owner, from a pet to his master, from 
an animal in captivity to his keeper. 
Description is less easy than narration because the order or 
arrangement of what is told is not decided for the writer as in story 
read or told, but has to be determined by himself. For this reason, 
and because it demands critical power in choosing and rejecting 
detail, descriptive writing of anything but the simplest “things 
seen” is a more suitable exercise for upper than for lower standard 
children. Preparatory exercises in description should, however, 
be given from Standard IL upwards, beginning with short oral 
descriptions in connection with geography and nature study 
(Standard II) and passing, through short oral descriptions of things 
seen (Standard III), to written reproduction of descriptions read 
(Standard IV). In this last form of exercise the children are helped 
to overcome one of the chief difficulties by remembering the order 
of reading. It, therefore, keeps near narration although the
-P-A-G-E-206
tal 
  The Teaching of Composition 193 
memory will be less vivid than in the case of a story. The first 
exercises in unaided descriptive writing should be given in 
Standard V, and even there we shall often find that our pupils do 
not know what to write “ first ” and “next.” If the description is of 
a holiday or visit, there is the order of time to help them. If it is 
of a scene, the matter is more difficult. They may be helped by 
a suggestion that they try to remember what first caught their eye 
in looking at the scene, and then to recall the details of the scene in 
the order in which they noticed them. When they look at a scene 
or an object, they see the most striking features first and then the 
less striking, and they will give the best description when they keep 
to the order of seeing. When they are describing things experi- 
enced instead of things seen, they should, unless they give their 
description in order of time, write first of those things which made 
the deepest impression on them. 
We should give one caution to our pupils when they are about to 
attempt description—the caution to avoid using what we may call 
“ adjectives of opinion,” such as “ beautiful,” “ pretty,” “ nice,” 
“horrible.” Description should call up a clearly defined vision of 
the thing described, and these cannot do it, for they have no exact 
meaning. In description, “adjectives of fact” are wanted ; as, 
for example, “black,” “ “undulating,” “feathery.” Each of these 
raises an image which i is the same for each person who reads. 
When writing descriptions, we should tell the children, they should 
aim at enabling their readers to see, and not try to tell them what 
they must feel. 
Standard VI.—Oral exercises as in Standard V, more and more 
stress being laid on continuous oral expression ; the summarising 
of a passage read by the children in class. 
Written exercises (in the form of Jetters or otherwise) on the 
oral work, imaginative efforts being encouraged ; summaries, with 
headings, of what has been read or studied. 
Teaching on the colon and semi-colon. 
When it is considered of what value, both from a business and 
social point of view, the power to write a good letter may prove, it 
will be readily allowed that a large part of the composition time 
of this senior standard should be given to cultivating it. The letters 
given to be written, as the form has been mastered earlier, should 
cover a wide range of subjects. 
N
-P-A-G-E-207
194 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
Occasional revisionary lessons on form should be given, how- 
ever, with the object of Securing good arrangement of the matter 
contained in letters. 
The pupils, for instance, should be advised to jot down first, 
when practising letter-writing, the things that they wish to say ; 
then, looking through these notes to decide on the order of topics, 
finding the best for opening and numbering it one, and putting the 
successive numbers against the rest in the order in which they will 
most naturally follow. When finished, this plan should be criti- 
cised—Is it the clearest possible from the standpoint of a person 
who does not know beforehand what the writer wishes to say P— 
for a letter should give the reader a clear idea of what the writer 
- desires to convey and not be a mere jumble of statements without 
sequence or arrangement. If the plan, upon being subjected to 
criticism, does not give satisfaction, it should be altered before the 
letter itself is begun. 
To emphasize this need for arrangement a letter written without 
any thought being given to it should be put before the pupils, who 
should be told to arrange the matter and rewrite the letter. 
Standard VII.—-Oral exercises as in Standard VI ; discussions 
on matters of current interest ; expansion of a brief outline—as, 
for example, of a proverb or short poem, to show the full meaning. 
Written work as in Standard VI ; with, also, occasional essays 
in subjects within the pupils’ capacity ; précis of given matter 
with suitable headings and arrangement. 
Teaching on the remaining punctuation marks, and on the 
choice of words, including a lesson on simile and metaphor. 
Paraphrasing as an exercise in composition has; not without 
reason, fallen into disfavour of late years. When school children 
were set to put into their own words one of the finest passages of 
the great masters, the exercise naturally resulted in what had been 
expressed beautifully being expressed badly, or at least baldly ; 
and it was felt that better means might be devised for seeing that 
they had grasped the meaning of such passages. 
There is, however, a variation of the exercise which may be 
made extremely useful. A piece of good prose may be put in front 
of the children; blanks being left in the place of some of the most 
telling Swords and phrases. The children may then be told to fill 
1 From Fr. précis, L. precisus (pra=before ; cedere=to cut)—a precise 
or abridged statement ; an abstract or summary,
-P-A-G-E-208
- The Teaching of Composition 195 
in these blanks with words of their own. The chief value of the 
exercise lies in the subsequent comparison of the substitutions with 
the original and the discussion that should follew it. 
The exercise may also be used as a means of making our pupils 
familiar with the use of figures of speech, a very necessary form of 
instruction for upper classes. The reading of an average set of 
Seventh Standard essays often fails to reveal a single example of 
figurative expression. As a great “ enlivening ” of their composi- 
tion would result from a use of simile and metaphor, something 
should certainly be done to get our pupils to introduce these 
figures. The writings of Rudyard Kipling are especially rich in 
both simile and metaphor, and if a dozen or more sentences from 
one of his children’s books (say, Puck of Pook’s Hill) were used as 
suggested above, we should be almost sure to find the result in the 
next set of compositions. . 
Essay writing is the last and most difficult form of composition, 
and is rightly left for the Seventh Standard ; but the word “ essay ” 
is so loosely used in connection with school composition, being 
applied to any form of it that is not a story or a letter, that the 
children gain no insight into its special characteristics, and feel no 
humility about attempting this highest form of prose writing. 
This is not to be wondered at when they are told to “ write essays ” 
on subjects to which they are not}likely to have given any 
thought. 
Before our pupils are set to write essays they should be given a 
clear notion of the distinguishing features of this form of composi- 
tion, and be taught in what respects it differs from other forms 
which they have previously attempted. There is no better way of 
gaining the necessary knowledge than by the study of suitable 
essays of good writers, and, as has been suggested, a collection of 
these should be among the reading books of Standards VI and VII. 
From the literary study of Dream Children the pupils may dis- 
cover that an essay seeks to convey an impression of the writer’s 
thoughts on some subject suggested, if not actually expressed, by 
the title ; that it is not simple narrative, though it may introduce 
narrative ; nor simple description, though that may be brought in 
to give beauty and richness to the treatment of the theme. Its 
distinctive feature is reflection. It may seem to deal with more 
than one topic ; but examination shows thatithey are so closely: 
related as merely to expand the main theme and never--in a, well
-P-A-G-E-209
196 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
constructed essay—to open up entirely new avenues of thought. 
In Dream Children the pupils have an example of the skill with 
which thought may be made to flow from one connected side- 
stream into another, yet return always to the main channel through 
which it reaches at last its predetermined end. If they are 
inspired to try to gain something of this skill, the study will be 
fulfilling its purpose. 
But practice is needed as well as study. This should take the 
form of weaving double and multiple sentences into others which 
are. complex, and noting how the change of construction gives a 
stronger impression of ‘“ unity” ; Grammar lessons on the “ con- 
nection” or “link” will have practical application in this work. 
By means of this part of speech sentence must be interwoven with 
sentence and paragraph with paragraph as the shuttle of thought 
passes back and forward, to and fro. Not all essays, however, 
need paragraph division. The essay of “ Elia” on Dream Children, 
mentioned above, is written in one long paragraph of several pages, 
and the writer, with wonderful skill, makes the two words “ here ” 
and “then” serve for the dividing and uniting of his reverie. 
Study of this one essay alone will do much to quicken our pupils’ 
appreciation of the originality of thought and the graces of style 
that must go to the writing of essays. 
In letter-writing and essay-writing—the culmination of all the 
work in composition—the pupils will need to put into practice all 
that they have learnt of sentence-building and paragraph-forma- 
tion, Concurrently with the further,definite lessons on punctua- 
tion, on figures of speech and on more advanced grammatical rules, 
criticism of sentences taken from letters and essays written in class 
must go on with the aim of correcting faults of expression. 
Punctuation (VI and VII): Use of semi-colon—to separate less 
entirely than the full stop a number of complete sentences of 
which the subjects are closely related, as, for example, successive 
parts of a description. 
- Use of colon—to prepare for a list or enumeration, and after 
such expressions as “namely,” “the following.” It is frequently 
followed by a dash. : 
Use of brackets or dashes—to separate certain words in a 
sentence from the rest, especially when a complete sentence has to 
be interrupted by way of explanation and modification. Such 
an interjected part is called a parenthesis,
-P-A-G-E-210
The Teaching of Composition 197 
Note: A warning against too frequent use of dashes, when 
comma or semi-colon might do the work, should be given. 
For the majority of teachers the correction of exercises in com- 
position is a matter of such difficulty that some advice on the 
subject is necessary. The correction of compositions, it is to be 
feared, runs away with much of the time which should be given to 
preparation. The whole subject is beset with difficulties. In no 
other school subject is the task of correcting so laborious, for in the 
case of dictation, arithmetic and grammar exercises, a part at least 
-can be done by the pupils themselves, and tests in geography and 
history frequently admit of collective class corrections. In no 
other subject, either, is it so important, for if it is not thoroughly 
done, much of the value of the exercise is lost. The best method, 
undoubtedly, is for the teacher to go through each exercise with 
the writer of it, getting him to amend his faults orally ; but time 
will not allow of this, many teachers being unable to find a free 
moment in school to give to this important side of the work. 
Where a teacher out of school hours goes through each exercise, 
writing in corrections and suggestions, a whole night may slip 
away before even a third of the set has been corrected, and he has, 
all the time, the depressing consciousness that much of his labour 
is wasted. 
In these circumstances it is very necessary for us to form or 
learn some practical rules by which our marking of exercises may 
be at once less time-devouring and more profitable. The following 
are suggested : 
(1) Adopt a code of signs \—not too full, or it will defeat its 
purpose—for use in marking. For instance : 
C.= Capital letter needed. S.P.= Spelling wrong. 
P.= Punctuation wrong. ? Ex. = Questionable expression, 
mit. ? St. = Questionable statement. 
fot clear. A =An omission.     
    
   
    Py aragraph construction wrong. i =New paragraph needed. 
Ss. entence construction wrong. ue juotation marks needed. 
R.W. = Re-write. I, 2, 3= Order suggested, 
This code must be copied by the children on to the front page of 
their exercise books—or on the inside of the cover—and referred to 
until known by heart. 
1 That given is a modification, made during the teaching of composition, of 
one in The Teaching of English—Roberts and Barter (Blackie).
-P-A-G-E-211
198 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
“r:, (2) Choose™out two or three exercises for detailed criticism in 
class from .each set, and have these very carefully corrected by 
their writers—even entirely rewritten if necessary. Do not follow 
any regular order in selecting these, but keep a record to ensure 
each pupil’s composition getting full criticism in turn. 
(3) Try to go through one exercise with each pupil every term. 
" (4) Keep a notebook for jotting down the general errors in each 
get of exercises. This practice will result in the revealing of 
common weaknesses, and serve to direct the course of future 
lessons. ~

In the chapter on Grammar, reference was made to the necessity 
of dealing systematically with the errors of expression due to mis- 
application of idioms and constructions peculiar to one of the two 
languages spoken in the country. Suggestions will now be made 
with regard to the form such treatment should take, and examples 
will be given of some of the commonest errors. 
‘In the systematic treatment of common errors in composition 
the preparation of wall charts will be found valuable. These 
composition charts should show not only the chief errors met with, 
but the correct constructions for which they are substituted. Then 
when pupils make any of the mistakes shown on the chart, they 
may at once be referred to the correct forms, and shown wherein 
those used are wrong. Although not strictly in place in a book 
on school method, a systematic analysis of the incorrect forms 
most commonly met with is given below, with the object of saving 
the time of students and teachers :

Of ‘not so?” ‘' This is a flower—‘notso’?” (Cf. English idiom 
“Ts it not ?”’) 
VII. Slang and Vulgarisms : Slang exists in every language; but 
specially common in South Africa is the excessive use of ‘‘ absolutely,” 
“lovely,” ‘‘ heaps,” and ‘‘ crowds” (instead of ‘‘a great deal”’) 
also such expressions as: He thinks ‘‘a mighty lot” of himself, he 
is ‘* on his own ” now ; he tried ‘‘ to do me down”’ ; there is “‘ precious 
little’? water here. A tendency to exaggerated intonation is also 
common—eg. “‘ absolately,”’ ‘‘ far far away.” 
Among vulgarisms is the use of ‘‘man,” eg. ‘“‘I say man! 
Come and see this”; of ‘‘ch?” eg. ‘‘ Bring me the plate, ‘ eh ?’”” 
and the expression ‘‘ Excuse ‘ me’ (‘ my’) saying so.”” 
The tendency to use colloquial forms in serious writing should be 
striven against, ¢.g. ‘‘shan’t,’” “‘ haven’t,” ‘‘ photo,” &c. The appto- 
priate language to.use in different forms of letter-writing requires 
careful study. 
VIII. Incorrect Spelling and Punctuation :—A specially common 
mistake in South Africa is the combination into one word of two that 
should remain separate—e .g.“alright,” of which ‘‘ allright” is the correct 
form, “afteral”” (‘after all”), ‘ atonce” (‘‘at once”’), ‘‘ anymore” 
(“any more.”’). The opposite mistake is seen in‘‘ some body” (“‘some- 
body”) and “all together” (‘‘altogether.”) Pairs of words of like sound 
are often confused—e.g. ‘‘ there’ (adverb) and ‘‘ their” (pronoun) ; 
“were” (verb) and “ where ” (adverb) ; ‘‘ practice ’’ (noun) and “‘ prac- 
tise”’ (verb); “principal” (chief) and “ principle” (rule of conduct). Small 
words which seem to give trouble are “‘ too” (It is to (‘‘ too’) hot to 
work), ‘‘ weird” (very often written wievd), ‘‘ they’’ (appearing as 
“ the a reflection of the way in which it is pronounced). Note also 
the following: bycicle (for ‘‘ bicycle”), donkies and vallies (for ‘‘ donkeys”
-P-A-G-E-217
204 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
and “‘ valleys”), beautifull (for ‘* beautiful "), He was lead (“led”) 
away; fourty (‘‘ forty”). That much misspelling is due to faulty 
pronunciation is beyond doubt, e.g. moto-cay (due to slurring of the r 
of motor), docter (for ‘‘doctor’’), accommidated (for ‘‘accommodated ”’). 
The misspelling of place names and the omission of capitals with 
proper nouns are other common errors. . 
e neglect of punctuation is very marked at the present time ; 
the subject should be taught much more systematically. Very often 
a sentence has no ‘‘ full stop’’ at the end, or a ‘‘ comma” is made to 
separate the subject from the predicate in quite a short sentence. 
The misuse of the apostrophe also calls for attention—e.g. tts your's 
(for ‘‘ it’s yours’) and your's (for “‘ yours”) affectionately. 
Systematic use of charts showing such characteristic errors and 
the correct forms which should be substituted for them will do much 
to lessen the number of mistakes with which compositions and 
examination papers are crowded. But such methods will only be 
applied throughout the country when student-teachers become 
used to them in training colleges and centres, learning to draw up 
and use the necessary charts during their school practice, and, 
after their training is over, making regular use of them in the 
schools to which they are appointed. 
Such charts should, therefore, be made by all student-teachers 
during training. They should show errors (and the correct forms 
to be substituted) met with during school practice. The analysis 
of errors given in the foregoing pages will serve as a guide ; but 
it is not meant to be slavishly copied without regard to the mistakes 
actually made by pupils. *

CHAPTER IX 
THE TEACHING OF HISTORY 
“«What you have with you, and before you, daily, dearest to your sight 
and heart, ¢hat, by the magic . . . of your lips, you can gloriously express 
to others; and what you ought to have in your sight and heart,—what, if 
you have it not, nothing else can be truly seen or loved,—is the human 
life of your own. people, understood in its history, and admired in its 
presence.” —RUSKIN, 
“Without history, citizenship has no root; without citizenship, history 
has no fruit.”—J. R. SEELEY (paraphrased). 
* Land of our birth, our faith, our pride, 
¥or whose dear sake our fathers died ; 
O Motherland, we pledge to thee, 
Head, heart, and hand through the years to be.” 
The Children’s Song, RODVARD KIPLING. 
Tare is no school subject that should benefit more than history 
by the new movement and the new methods in education. The 
more clearly it is recognised by examiners and teachers that the 
storing of unrelated and undigested historical facts by the children, 
is of small value, while the effect of history teaching on their 
minds and on their life as members of a society or state, is of the 
greatest importance, the more will the way be cleared for history 
teaching of the right kind. 
To point out the value of history teaching should be un- 
necessary. The children of to-day are the men and the women of 
to-morrow ; and, when to-morrow comes, the government of the 
State to which they belong will be influenced—even controlled— 
by their judgments and their desires. Some knowledge of the 
story of the human race, and particularly of their own nation, 
with its warnings and its examples, will be needed to guide those 
judgments and govern those desires. Without much detailed know- 
ledge of their own country—its laws, its institutions, its fame—

inspiration to enlightened citizenship and patriotism: will: be 
lacking. , 
This inspiration to enlightened citizenship and patriotism is of 
supreme importance in a state in which the power to vote is as 
widely extended as in the Union of South Africa, where-it is con- 
ferred on all adult white males who have been resident in the 
country six months. Entrusting voting power to electors who are 
ignorant of the lessons of history, is like making engine-drivers of 
blind men. 
“The right understanding of the history of the past is indis- 
pensable to the rational moulding of the history of the future. 
Political action unenlightened by history is either fumbling em- 
piricism or the reckless enforcement of prejudice and self-interest. 
Patriotism unchastened by history is ignorant tribal arrogance,” 
( Kappa,” in Let Youth but Know). 
Very little, of course, towards the political education of future 
‘citizens can be accomplished in the short time at disposat-for history 
teaching in elementary schools, and no instruction that is open to 
the slightest suspicion of party bias should ever be given in them. 
Tf there were no other reason to urge against such a course, there 
would be the fact that we cannot foresee the political questions 
that will exercise the citizenship of our pupils in ten years’ time ; 
for the political situation is constantly changing. What we owe 
them in this matter is a mind and character training, through the 
facts of history, that will enable them to approach whatever prob- 
lem the politics of their own day may put before them, not only 
with honesty and intelligence, but also with a knowledge of the 
errors and the wisdom of centuries of politics and statesmanship. 
But enlightened citizenship is the latest fruit of history teaching. 
In the schoolroom we must work for the fulfilment of this distant 
aim of all our teaching, through a nearer one that may be fulfilled 
in each lesson—the aim to interest our pupils. 
There is something amazing in the fact that the subject is not 
found more generally interesting in schools, Ai? children like 
stories, and like them none the less when they are true, and history: 
is filled with true stories. As one of “the Little People ” for whom 
Jock of the Bushveld was written, said of that book: “TI love it 
because it’s full of the things we know, and because it’s a true 
story about our own country ;” so for the same reasons all children
-P-A-G-E-221
208 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
should love history, which, properly taught, will be seen to-be “ full 
of the things [they] know.” In older pupils who have begun to be 
interested in personality history records the feelings, sayings, and 
doings of a great company of personages, gossip of a grand order— 
and quite harmless. It opens the fascinating pages of biography, 
inviting their attention at a time when their interest in conduct and 
motive and character is especially keen. Moreover, history, rightly 
taught, explains the causes and shows the beginnings of much that 
is matter of their everyday experience. From it we learn, too, 
how nations came to their present homes—what remote causes 
brought them by Jand and sea from far distant countries. To take 
only one example, it shows how, for the causes of European occupa- 
tion of South Africa to-day, we must look back to the fifteenth 
century and the wars between the Crescent and the Cross. Finally 
—tor history lessons should not deal only with national events and 
characters—it is the story of the human race, a more enthralling 
romance than has ever been imagined. 
In spite of all this, comparatively few school children “ like 
history” and, perhaps, comparatively few students. Several 
reasons can be found for this. The teaching of history in our 
schools is bégun too late, and errors of teaching have grown out of 
a mistaken notion of what the syllabus requires, this leading in 
turn’to an attempt to cover too much in a short space of time. As 
history is only beguiv in Standard V there is no possibility of teach- 
ing in any detail the whole of South African history, and, in 
English history, the period from the Norman Conquest to the 
Napoleonic Wars—a period crowded with figures and events—in 
the three years remaining before the school course ends. More 
especially is this so, now that it is recognised that this syllabus is 
absurdly inadequate in scope. Children must not be left in ignor- 
ance of all that happened in England before 1066, and they should 
know in addition to what they are at present taught something of 
Empire and of World History. It is quite obvious then that the 
necessary teaching can only be given in the broadest outline. 
But the time at which history is introduced into our schools 
and the attempt to teach it in too much detail, are not the only 
Teasons of its failure to interest. It has to be admitted that teachers, 
in many cases, have neither had sufficient knowledge of the subject 
nor known how to teach the little they knew. They have therefore 
been bound by the textbook in use in their class as regards both
-P-A-G-E-222
- lo A NE The Teaching of History 209 
matter and method; and very frequently their textbooks have 
consisted of scrappy uninviting paragraphs and long lists of dates 
and events, which they have set to be memorised without shedding 
a single ray of light upon their meaning, or vivifying them by a 
single human detail. They have looked upon history as something 
to be found in books and have not realised that traces of it may be 
seen in all our common ways. They have begun by talking about 
* Systems of Defence ” and not about the soldier in garrison, the 
magistrate in the court-house, and the policeman on his beat ; 
about. ‘“ Systems of Communication” not about the arrival or 
departure of some big liner or the bustle that announces the coming 
of a mail train into some great railway terminus, or the postcart 
that journeys by lonely roads to far-scattered and thinly-peopled 
places; about the “System of Parliamentary Government” and 
not about the excitement of an election day and the battle of the 
posters. Can we wonder that school children, wandering in worlds 
not realised, have failed to find interest in history ? 
It is now generally recognised that while young children are 
unable to appreciate history in its formal aspect as a study of the 
sequence of lives and events that make up the national or world 
story, they will be found to listen eagerly to the true stories of long 
long ago. 
As early as Standard I we may begin to lay a foundation on 
which to build in upper standard years a superstructure of that 
formal history which is closely linked together both in time and 
through cause and effect. The development through the lower 
standards of this early teaching by stories, which are not history but 
which lead up to history, will do something to make time for a better 
- form of learning than the fevered memorising of bare facts and dates 
which has been too common in the upper standards. The congestion 
must then be further relieved by our giving up the attempt to teach 
the whole of the lives and events that fall within the periods set for 
formal study, choosing those only which have educative value for 
our pupils and rejecting much that is merely informative. Vivid 
presentment of the great events and movements that have influenced, 
materially or spiritually, our present-day life is much more im- 
portant than a cursory treatment of many which have no other 
claim than that they are included in the text-book in use. History 
teaching in the past has been too much a matter of the lives of 
kings and. of their ambitions and quarrels resulting in wars and 
°
-P-A-G-E-223

battles which have been memorised as mere names and dates. . It 
must keep closer to the life of the people as a whole and :to each 
vital aspect of that life. Their customs and their-struggles’ for 
freedom and for better conditions of living, are now recognised to 
be true stuff of history. fons 
Until recently, again, the learning of dates by méchanical re- 
petition took up too much of the time given to the subject of history 
in schools. At present the tendency is just the other way, and 
dates are banished from many schemes of history téaching ‘with 
almost worse effect. If, in the past, history to the school child 
méant little more than glibly giving a date to an event or putting 
an event to a date, at present it is often no. more than a jumble 
of events to which they can assign no place in time at all.. The 
earlier practice was wrong in two particulars—it taught too many 
dates and it taught them in too abstract a fashion. The mere 
memorising of them made far too great inroads on the time at 
disposal for this wide subject, while it furnished very little in the 
way of ideas. Present practice, though it endeavours to supply 
more ideas, leaves them vague in many cases, because it does 
almost nothing to fit the events of which it treats into their place 
in histéry. A middle way must be followed. Dates must be 
given a place because without them history has no perspective ; 
things are not seen in their true relation to one another; background 
and foreground are indistinguishable. At the same time they must 
be kept within bounds and we must make all possible efforts to 
give graphic and concrete illustration of the flight of time. ‘‘ Time- 
lines ”—the use of which will be explained later—will. show the 
lapse ‘of time to the eye, while emphasis on the changes that have 
taken place—in dwellings, in dress, in weapons and warfare and in 
ways of living—will make it actual to the mind. 
It is further recognised now, that while we must omit from our 
history lessons much uninteresting and unimportant. detail we 
‘must furnish them with detail of another kind, going to original 
sources for those minute particulars of lives and events which 
make for vivid presentment. Until late years this has been 
almost impossible. “‘ Source” books were voluminous and costly. 
The busy class-teacher had neither time nor money for them. 
But things are very different now. There are many books of 
extracts from historical sources—original documents, letters, and 
narratives. written at the time of the events they describe,

himself with hearing and explaining a chapter set for home study, 
is not worthy of his calling. He will never succeed in bringing the

his pupils’ own lives and presenting it to them as a drama in

weak animal among monsters such as now people our nightmares ; 
but in his brain there lurks a cunning and in his hands a dexterity 
that are better than strength. His babblings, at first mere emo- 
tional and imitative noises, become gradually symbolic, and shape 
themselves into speech. He distinguishes between himself and 
the inexpressive animals around him, and calls himself Man, He 
covers himself with skins and seeks shelter in caves. Then he 
stumbles upon the secret of fire-making, fashions himself weapons 
and tools of wood and stone, and begins to subdue other animals 
to his uses. After a few ages he learns to wattle a hut on a defen- 
sible mound or to drive piles into shallow water and build his 
cabin upon them. The baking of clay and the smelting of metals 
are gradually mastered and art begins in the rude patterns which 
he ‘scratchés on his pots and weapons. Meanwhile the forces of 
Nature and the mysteries of life and death have been inspiring him 
with crude fancies, which, handed on with infinite variations from 
father to son, have grown into a body of grotesque myths clustering 
round a system of witchcraft and anti-witchcraft in which lies the 
germ of religion . . . Then in the teeming valleys of the great 
rivers of the East, enormous empires loom upon our view, in which 
myriads of men are held in servitude by a kingly or priestly caste.

They pile and hew great monuments, they invent hieroglyphs and 
letters, they war upon and devour each other from dynasty to 
dynasty. But meantime, ina little corner of mountainouscountry,1 
with a deeply indented coast line, an immigrant tribe has suddenly 
—in the course of a few centuries, that is to say——rushed through 
all the stages of barbarism, and stands, in some respects, on the 
very summit of civilisation. In sculpture and in one type of 
architecture it has reached the limit of conceivable perfection. It 
has laid the corner stones of the world’s poetry and philosophy. 
It has gained signal victories against overwhelming odds in a life 
and death struggle with one of the giant empires of Asia ; and 
it has sent forth a young warrior,? who has marched conquering 
from the Strymon to the Indus and has built a new empire out of 
the fragments of those he has shattered.” (‘Kappa,” in Let Youth 
but Know.) 
That is what history reveals of the beginnings of human story. 
Now let us read from its later records of South Africa. 
“ Away up on the shoulder of the Devil’s Peak the old Block 
House stares into the face of the rising sun . . . It was at the Block 
House they kept watch for the raiding Hottentots ; it was against 
that little breakwater that the waves from the ocean of barbarism 
used to thunder and break ; it was from there that they sallied out 
on great hunting expeditions among the elephants and lions, 
giraffe and eland in the far hinterland of the Cape Flats (where the 
suburban trains take you now in fifteen minutes). In those days 
hippos were plentiful in Princess Vlei near the Wynberg Golf 
Links . . . Who will tell the story of the pioneers? Not one 
man or one woman, however willing ; but many will be needed for 
the task—each to contribute his or her share, small or great, to 
preserving a record of which any country might be proud. No one 
person can do it or attempt it, for who are the pioneers ? Look up 
again at the old Block House on the shoulder of Devil’s Peak! They 
began there. Straight below it stands the monument to Rhodes, 
and two thousand miles north his body lies within a hundred 
yards of Alan Wilson’s, A thousand miles still further north the 
pioneers are pressing in to-day ; and west and east every mile has 
had its pioneer—men and women, Dutch and English—Our People

who made Our Country . . . Is it not one country! And ours?” 
(Sir Percy Fitzpatrick, in The State.) 
One more passage and I must stop quoting, though the temp- 
tation to continue is almost irresistible. 
“¢ Blood River feeds the Buffalo, and the Buffalo the Tugela ; 
and the marks of history lie thick hereabouts. Forty years after the 
Boers crushed Dingaan, the British crushed Ketshwayo and finally 
broke the Zulu power, and all within a radius of a few miles. 
Isandhiwana, where the 24th Regiment was annihilated, lies only 
a little way to the left as we look from Verkykers Kop. Rorke’s 
Drift, where Chard and Bromhead with some seventy men in a 
laager of biscuit tins and flour bags, beat off five thousand of 
Ketshwayo’s best men fresh from the Isandhlwana victory, is no 
more than five miles from the spot where the Boer laager stood on 
Dingaan’s Day. Kambula and Hlobane Mountain—so nearly 
another disaster—are close by: and further back to the left is 
Ulundi, where Ketshwayo learned from the British what Dingaan 
had learned from the Boers. It was at Hlobane that the second of 
the Piet Uys tragedies occurred. He with his five sons joined 
Sir Evelyn Wood, as is recorded, ‘ to take vengeance on the Zulus 
for the death of my father and brother.’ Once more it was an 
ambush and a retreat, and once more it was a Piet Uys doing all 
that bravery could do to avert disaster ; but this time it was the 
father who went back hearing of his son’s danger—and:gave his life 
for his son. It was that same day that Colonel Weatherly, fighting 
off the foremost Zulus to give his thirteen-year-old boy a chance to 
escape, fell wounded, and as in the case of the first Piet Uys the 
gallant youngster went back and stood over his father until he too 
fell They found the boy’s body lying across his father’s.” 
It is history of this kind, the human life of our own people, 
“ not the cold hard thing of facts and dates, of ink and parchment, 
but the life as it was lived with its joys and sorrows, its trials, 
triumphs and tragedies ; warm with the life-blood of those who 
lived and died for us to make Our Country and (though they 
knew it not) to make it one ”—it is such history we must teach our 
pupils if we would have them love it and be eager to pursue the 
study of it.
-P-A-G-E-227
214 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
Having noted some of the errors in teaching which have come 
between the pupils and their enjoyment of history, we must 
now decide what are the aims which should govern our teaching. 
All South African boys and girls have, by virtue of their nation- 
ality, certain privileges and duties ; and history, which shows the 
origin of these, can be made to inspire them with the desire to 
perform their duties in honourable payment for their privileges, 
Such matters cannot be treated in any fullness of detail in elemen- 
tary schools, but even there children can be brought to see what a 
debt of practical gratitude they owe to the pioneers of the nation 
who have turned the country from what it was to what it is, and 
can be led to feel that true patriotism demands of them that they 
preserve and extend, for those that come after them, the benefits 
won by so much sacrifice on the part of their forefathers. 
Their history lessons should also be the means. of implanting in 
them a just pride in their South African nationality, and this should 
not interfere with, but rather encourage, the growth of a, generous 
appreciation of the good qualities of other nations with whom they 
may come in contact or of whom they may read. They should be 
made aware of the characteristics which distinguish peoples from 
each other and must be saved from the mistake of believing that 
their own nation is, in all respects, better than any other. 
We have now to consider both the matter and method of teach- 
ing in relation to the work of the standards. In doing so we must 
bear certain general principles in mind. These are : first, that in 
all stages of teaching both matter and method must be suited to 
the age of the children. being taught ; second, that they must be 
accompanied by as much concrete illustration—in the form of 
relics and records, prints and pictures and portraits—as can be 
provided, and third, that prose and poetry bearing on the subject 
of the lessons should be read or quoted by the teacher, and in some 
cases learnt by the children, whenever such extracts can be made 
to render the teaching more vivid. 
. History, as a formal subject, we have seen, should not begin 
until the fifth standard. In the lower standards, however, lessons 
leading up to history proper should prepare the way for it. Stan- 
dard IV should be regarded as a transition year in which the nature 
of the lessons begins gradually to change, inclining more and more 
to the formal character demanded by senior standard work. 
In the Sub-Standards stories should be drawn from various

sources and should include examples of the heroic literature of as 
many people as possible—“ real” stories, for the greater part, as 
opposed to the fairy tales with which the teaching of literature 
begins. . Those in the Bible deal with the life of the Hebrews. 
Kingsley’s Heroes and Hawthorne’s Tanglewood Tales furnish the 
legends of the Greeks in a form that needs little alteration to 
adapt them to the youngest classes. The Norse legends occur in 
the Heroes of Asgard and in Alice Zimmern’s Gods and Heroes of the 
North, while Malory’s Morte D’Arthur supplies Celtic examples. 
The South African Fairy Tales of Mrs. Bourbill and Mrs. Drake 
contain some native folk-lore tales, and in Outa Karel’s Stories 
(contributed to various numbers of The State magazine), some 
Bushman and. Hottentot folk-lore stories are charmingly told by 
S. Metelerkamp.. Some of Rudyard Kipling’s Just So Stories, 
which tell of “the beginnings of things in the high and 
far-off times,” may also be made to help in the laying of historical 
foundations. 
When the Sub-Standard years are over, more direct, though 
still informal, history-teaching should begin. In the standards 
the history-teaching has two main divisions, each with character- 
istic features of. its own—the teaching for younger and for older 
scholars. Connecting these, as has been said, will be the tran- 
sition teaching of the Standard IV year, which has something of 
the nature of both methods. 
The history.of the home country and people should be an in- 
heritance.of childhood, but, as in the lowest standard the method 
must still be:that of illustrated story-telling, other lives and events 
than national ones should be drawn upon. Tales of the far-off 
days told in simple, vivid language and illustrated by pictures—- 
brightly-coloured and not over-crowded with detail—and by black- 
board sketches, are suitable for junior pupils. Pictures and 
sketehes should Jay stress on the look of people, houses, ships, 
weapons and tools, for at this stage the teaching must be as con- 
crete as possible.. No book need be used in the first two standards, 
but after these two years of story-telling a good historical-reader 
with simple, vivid narrative and copious, full-page and coloured 
illustrations (such as, for example, the Highroads of History, 
Nelson) should be brought into use in Standard IIT. 
We may now consider the work of the three junior standards in 
greater detail.
-P-A-G-E-229
216 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
In the first and second years the lives of famous men and 
women in general history should be told as vividly and pic- 
turesquely as possible, and an effort made to link their names to 
some heroic deed or impressive story. Such personal qualities of 
these heroes and heroines as the children can appreciate—courage, 
kindness, ‘unselfishness, love of home and country—should be 
brought out, and the influence of their lives made clear. Pictorial 
illustrations, which should be freely used, should be bold in line 
and colouring, and the word-painting should have the same quality. 
The result of teaching at this stage depends on all impressions 
being made as vivid as possible, and it is better to tell a few stories 
in full detail than to deal cursorily with many. Occasionally, 
in place of the usual biographical story, some topic which connects 
history with geography might be chosen—as, for example, “ Early 
Ways of Life ”—-hunting, pastoral, agricultural, 
InStandard III the teaching of the lives of great men and women 
of South African, Empire and General History should be con- 
tinued. In this standard there should be an attempt to make the 
children realise the passage of time between the life of one famous 
personage and another, or between two events. The use of lines 
of time which represent such intervals graphically, will be found 
helpful here. When the first story is told a vertical line to re- 
present the period to be covered by the year’s teaching should 
be drawn on the blackboard and divided into lengths represent- 
ing ten, a hundred, or a thousand years, according to the length 
of the period. The dates of the “life” or event should then 
be entered as the lesson proceeds. The drawing of this line 
should be repeated every lesson, and dates entered for each person 
or topic treated. Gradually the children will come to realise the 
time-relation existing between one and another through the whole 
period. An example may be useful. Let us suppose that our 
Standard III class is learning the important “lives ” in the period 
from the coming of the Romans to the coming of the Normans. 
The time-line for the period would be something as follows :

If some such line of time is drawn repeatedly and filled in as 
the year’s work proceeds the children will get from it a fuller sense 
of proportion and of relative duration than dates alone can give. 
This can be further strengthened by occasional questioning on the 
lapse of time between one “ life” or event and another, and on 
the general changes that had taken place in the country during it. 
After a little practice the drawing of these lines of time during 
teaching comes quite naturally. When any one of them is com- 
pleted it should be copied by the children into their note-books. 
Each division of history taught—national, imperial, general—calls 
for a separate one. In the higher standards the most important 
events in each of these should be entered on a longer line made for 
the purpose of giving a connected idea of world history.
-P-A-G-E-231
218 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
Topical lessons in this year might depict the way of life of the 
people of Asia and Egypt, tracing their pastoral occupations to 
the semi-desert climate and the number of large mammals they 
were able to subdue to their service. 
The stories taken with Standard III should in the first instance 
be told, and the telling should be made as vivid, picturesque and 
dramatic as possible. The same lessons should then be read by 
the children. The map of the country which was the scene of the 
life or event, should always be in front of the children at the time 
of their lesson, and pictorial illustrations, other than those-in the 
reader, should be used to increase interest and aid understanding. 
These, however, will frequently need supplementing by blackboard 
plans, diagrams, and sketches, which may be made to bring out 
and emphasize certain points in the lesson. From time to time 
scholars should be asked to give in their own words the substance 
of the story told and read. 
We have now in our consideration of a scheme for history teach- 
ing reached the fourth standard year which, as has been said, should 
be regarded and treated as a transition period between junior and 
senior work. Biographical and topical lessons should still be given 
as in the earlier standards, the formal study of events in their 
sequence being left till the following year ; but the method should 
gradually change, less emphasis being now laid on picturesque 
detail and descriptions of concrete things. These remain important 
for the purpose of making the instruction vivid, but the lasting 
results of the character and actions of the famous men and women 
whose lives are dealt with must now be brought out. The lives 
of Diaz, Columbus and da Gama, for instance, should be associated 
with the decline of the power of the Turk, the extending of trade, 
increase of commodities and enrichment of nations, which resulted 
from the voyages of those mariners. Luther’s life and teaching 
should be connected with the religious changes they caused. 
The adventurous courage and hardihood of Drake, Raleigh and 
Grenville should be shown to have led to the defeat of Spain and 
the decline of the Roman Catholic power, and Pym and Hampden’s 
sturdy independence of character to have brought. about the 
downfall of Charles I and the gain of political freedom. The aim of 
the lessons, which has hitherto been to train the imagination—to 
enable the children to see—should now be to cultivate the intelli-. 
gence—to help them to understand.
-P-A-G-E-232
I The Teaching of History 219 
A more strictly chronological order should be followed in the 
choice of lessons, As European history in South Africa extends 
over a period of less than three hundred years—in. contrast with 
the many centuries through which it can be traced in Europe—it. 
should be possible in this year to go through the whole, in outline, 
from the first extension of the Cape Settlement soon after Van 
Riebeck’s arrival as commander in 1652, to the Union of the four: 
Provinces in 1910. 
Hitherto, formal history has been taken up in Standard V 
without any preliminary leading up to it, and pupils have begun 
English History at the Norman Conquest without knowing anything 
about the earlier period or about the various peoples on the European 
mainland from which the Normans came. The fourth standard 
year is a good one for supplying this knowledge. In Standard. ITI, 
as has been said, the children should have been interested in the 
ancient civilisations of Asia and Egypt, in their semi-desert climates 
and the number of their large mammals suited for domestication ; 
in the resulting pastoral occupations and the beginnings of culti- 
vation. From this point General History should be pursued in 
the story of the Pheenicians, Greeks, Carthaginians and Romans— 
nations which, owing to the beginnings of sea-faring on the 
Mediterranean, to the better waterways and larger amount of culti- 
vable land, supplanted the older civilisations. From the govern- 
ment and later fall of the Roman Empire they should pass to 
the withdrawal of the Celt before the invading Teuton and on- 
ward again to the rise of modern nations. If such teaching, 
followed up to the time of the Norman Conquest, were given 
during the fourth standard year, Standard V would begin its 
formal study of history with the interest which comes of previous 
knowledge. The Roman occupation of Britain and the subse- 
quent invasions by Angles, Saxons and Danes should precede the 
history of the Norman Conquest, and the first should receive 
special attention. Lessons on the great personalities during this 
period of English history—Cesar, Agricola, Boadicea—should be 
adapted to the present age of the pupils and revised. Further 
lessons on the Saxon and Anglian invasions should show how 
Teutonic government began in England. Others should. be given 
on Aidan and .Bede and Cedmon in the Christianising period ; 
and, later;-on Alfred the Great and Ethelred Redeless, showing 
the effects of the policy they respectively adopted towards the
-P-A-G-E-233

Danes in England. The lives of Godwin and Harold should also 
be revised to show the English in conflict with the Norman friends 
and relations of Edward the Confessor at the time of their first 
entry into England during the reign of that un-English king. 
With the more formal and continuous teaching that must begin 
in the fifth standard the choice of a text-book different in char- 
acter from the readers of the junior standards becomes necessary. 
On the choice and use of this book the “‘ Suggestions” of the English 
Board of Education may be quoted as emphasizing what is needed : 
“ Oral teaching is still indispensable and should be regarded as 
of the first importance ; but as the children grow older and become 
more capable of serious effort the oral lessons should be supple- 
mented by the study of a continuous history book. As the subject 
of history offers exceptional opportunites for the training of. chil- 
dren in the power of silent reading with intelligence and concentra- 
tion, the selection of a good book is of great importance. The best 
students’ text-books are too difficult for children at this stage, yet 
the books chosen for the higher classes should possess many of the 
good qualities of such text-books. Technical phraseology on the 
one hand and childish simplicity on the other must be avoided ; 
the book should contain abundant sound historical matter and be 
free from padding, vagueness, or mere allusiveness ; and while the 
more important personages and events are treated with greater 
fullness, the narrative should not be so fragmentary as to destroy 
the sense of continuity. Nor should the value of good illustrations 
be overlooked when the choice is made.” 
But, however excellent the text-book, it cannot take the place 
of oral lessons, and we must not delude ourselves by thinking that 
we are teaching history if we only set chapters—or, which is better, 
topics—to be studied at home, and spend subsequent lessons in 
questioning our pupils on their knowledge of them. Reading 
through the lessons with them in school, and explaining what seems 
necessary, comes little nearer to what is required. Well-planned, 
carefully prepared, vivid and vigorous oral teaching is absolutely 
necessary if our pupils are to gain full benefit from the subject. 
Reading with the class, with incidental questioning and exposition, 
if it is not allowed to usurp the place of oral teaching, is a very useful 
practice; properly done, it will show the children how to read 
privately. Oral questioning should follow the private study: of 
any topic, but continuous oral narrative and written reproduction
-P-A-G-E-234
ee 
et ad 
he 
-e The Teaching of History 221 
should also be required as a test of knowledge and intelligent 
appreciation with the power of expression. The children’s ten- 
dency to memorise the words of the text mechanically must be 
checked. Questions and tests which do not permit of answers in 
the words of the book, but demand an intelligent rearrangement 
of the matter, will be the best means of effecting this. 
The question of finding time for preparing carefully a large 
number of oral lessons needs some consideration, since history is not 
the only subject which makes the demand. The busy class teacher 
who is responsible for all the subjects of school instruction, and 
perhaps for more than one class, may well wonder how he can do jus- 
tice to his pupils without doing injustice to his own body and mind. 
In all subjects the ideal to be aimed at is one good oral lesson, at 
least, each week; but it may not be possible to accomplish so much 
at first. Most of us, however, teach for several years if not “ for 
life,’ and school authorities will be satisfied and the pupils’ interests 
well served if during the first year or two this ideal is only being 
approached. If all notes made are carefully kept (though they 
shouldnot be used a second timewithout revision, since some virtue, 
which must be renewed, goes out of lesson notes at each using) it 
will in time be found possible to give the ideal number of prepared 
oral lessons, In the course of years the material for a full scheme 
will bein hand. Interest in the matter and power over the method 
of them will increase with the time spent on them ; and they will 
be easily worked up, by additions, omissions and rearrangement, 
into better and better lessons as time goes on. 
Tt is now generally agreed that pupils should receive their first 
knowledge of history through the story of their own people as they 
receive their first knowledge of geography through the place they 
live in, and their first knowledge of language through their mother 
tongue. It is not for patriotic reasons alone, or even chiefly, that 
this is urged. The aim of the teaching demands it, for it is only 
when history begins at home that we can make full use of con- 
crete illustrations through which young children can be helped 
to understand it and so be interested. The teaching of world 
history, side by side with the story of their own nation, is coming 
to be recognised, more and more, as necessary to the intelligent 
understanding of the latter. For reasons similar to those which 
place national history first there should, in European schools, be 
more emphasis laid on General European history than on that of 
the world at large. In addition, some knowledge of the building

up of that great Empire, the rights, privileges and duties of which 
they inherit, and of the men and women whose lives and deeds are 
its lasting glory is, for South African children, a birthright of which 
they should not be deprived. fo. 
Some suggestions as to the treatment of the subject-matter 
falling within. the various periods may be useful here. 
The Norman period opens with the introduction into England 
from the Continent ‘of the Feudal System of land letting and hold- 
ing, and closes with' the breakdown of this system through the 
slaying, in the Wars of the Roses, of almost all the great nobles. 
Clearly then the tracing of its rise, growth and fall must be made 
one of the main lines of treatment, and all that affected the system 
must be brought out in the course of the lessons. 
Another feature of the period was the Crusades,in which we have 
the first and direct phase of the struggle for religious and commer- 
cial supremacy between the Christian and Moslem powers. The 
‘close of the period carries it forward to the year before: the dis- 
covery of the Cape, through which the struggle entered on its second, 
indirect, commercial phase. The taking of Constantinople by 
the Turks is one of the most far-reaching events of the period, and 
as such must receive due emphasis, although its effects were not 
felt till the next period. / 
Special attention must also be given in this period to the rise of 
Parliament in England, for the “ Mother of Parliaments” has in- 
fluenced the constitutions of all Western nations and of South Africa. 
Chronologically European history in South Africa does not begin 
till after the close of this period ; and herein, as it extends over less 
than three hundred years, is an argument in favour df leaving the 
study of it from this standpoint until the sixth standard year, in 
which it: may be treated with sufficient detail. If it has already 
been taken; biographically and topically, in Standards I to IV, as 
suggested, the pupils will not be ignorant of it. The fifth standard 
year will, for the purposes of South African history, be better 
spent in acquiring a knowledge of related events in Europe, and 
of the outstanding personalities of the three European peoples, 
French, Dutch and British, which form the main parent stock of 
the South African nation. From such a course of lessons the pupils 
will come to their South African history at the beginning of the next 
‘year with a knowledge of what lies behind it in the history of the 
nations which have made it what it is.
-P-A-G-E-236

Tn Standard VI, therefore, they will have a much better chance 
of following with interest and understanding events from 1486 to 
the present day. The years of Portuguese exploration will not 
demand many lessons, though a few stories should be told of the 
explorers, ‘adventurers and missionaries of the first European nation 
to set foot in the country. From the first Dutch occupation (1652) 
to the time of Union is a period of only two hundred and sixty years ; 
and, as it is much less crowded with events and personalities than 
a similar period in European history, it should not be impossible 
to master, during the year, all in it that is inspiring and of 
historical value. 
The period of European history 1485-1688 opens with the Age 
of Discovery. The exploration of the coast of Africa by the Portu- 
guese, and the reaching of India by da Gama should be taken, as 
suggested above, as a part of South African history. The voyages 
of Columbus and the Cabots to the West are of equal importance. 
The small part taken by England at first should be noted, and the 
later encouragement given by Henry VII and all the Tudor sove- 
reigns whose shrewdness was not long ‘in realising the value and 
importance of these discoveries to the rulers under whose patronage 
they were made. The voyages of the great Elizabethan explorers 
provide fascinating subjects for oral lessons, and the children 
should be directed to contemporary accounts and to such books 
as Kingsley’s Westward Ho ! and such poems as Macaulay’s Spanish 
Armada, The Armada itself demands full treatment because of 
its effect on world history. Other great movements of the period 
were the Renaissance and the Reformation. The progress of the 
Jatter movement should be traced from its beginnings in connection 
with the life and teachings of Wyclif in England, Huss in Switzer- 
land, and Luther in Germany, to its spread through France, 
Holland and England—the countries most closely associated 
with South African history. Henry VIII’s personal reasons for 
desiring to throw off the authority of the Pope should be brought 
out, and the course of the movement during the reigns of Edward 
and Elizabeth—with the intervening set-back in the halli- Spanish 
Mary’s time—should be followed. Special attention must be given 
to the colonising enterprise of the principal European nations in 
the seventeenth century and most emphasis laid again on that of 
Holland,-France and England. The struggle between the Stuart 
kings and Parliament in England must be followed as one effect

advantage, are full of interest and instruction. The reaction that 
Jed to the recall of Charles II should be touched upon, and his 
callous self-interest and the folly and stupidity of James II be 
shown as the causes of the Revolution which closes the period. 
Empire history of the time should deal with the planting of 
colonies on Newfoundland (Gilbert) and Roanoke Island (Raleigh) ; 
with the charter to the East India Company and the first 
British factory in India ; with the founding of the New England and 
later American Colonies ; with the attack on those of. Spain and 
the taking of Jamaica. 
In Standard VII, South African history taken up from the civic 
side, would give to pupils in their last school year a necessary 
knowledge of the growth of rights and privileges, of the constitu- 
tion under which they are enjoyed, and of the duties inseparable 
from true citizenship. To this should be added, as needful for South 
African pupils, instruction on the duties attaching to the govern- 
ment of subject races. 
The General History of the period will be specially concerned 
with colonial expansion, with the loss of the American Colonies and 
the relations between England and France in the eighteenth cen- 
tury, with the final establishment of Britain’s supremacy at sea and 
her colonial and commercial expansion, with the French Revolu- 
tion and Napoleonic Wars, and with the Industrial Revolution. 
The acceptance of the Crown of England by William of Orange— 
husband of Mary Stuart—as William III is of peculiar interest to 
South Africans, and the prosecution of his wars against Louis XIV 
forms an important part of the relations between England and 
France, 
Many of these subjects may seem remote from the children’s 
interests and experience. When, however, the children have been 
prepared through the lower standards, by teachers who themselves 
feel the interest and value of history, for the formal lessons of these
-P-A-G-E-238

later. years there will be many lines of thought bridging 
the gulf. Even now there are points, discoverable if we look for 
them, at which the children’s experience touches or approaches 
the customs, circumstances and events of these earlier times. 
There is a “ child’s end ” at which to begin. 
While, then, there is certainly a danger of lessons on law-making 
and religious changes, for example, remaining to the children dull 
and of little meaning, there is also a possibility of clothing these 
matters with interest ; for, as the author of Studies in the Teaching 
of History assures us : 
“|, , there is nothing abstract or intangible about legislation 
for those who are brought into contact with it... . An increase 
in the income tax is not in the least abstract to the boy who is told 
that for him and his brothers it means a fortnight less at the sea- 
side. For the boy . . . the concrete is the small human detail, 
and if we can show in this detail the effect that legislation had upon * 
the lives of human beings its abstract appearance vanishes at once.” 
The writer then goes on to show how by introducing a personal 
element and weaving a story round the persons introduced streams 
of interest may be made to trickle even through the “ Sahara ” of 
Edward I’s legal activity : 
“ The Statute of Morimain checked the giving of lands to corpora- 
tions which were unable to perform feudal service.” 
When Standard V children meet with this or a similar state- 
ment in their text-books, it means nothing to them and they pro- 
ceed to memorise it mechanically. Yet even this may be turned 
into live history, as Mr. Keatinge shows : 
         Baron A? Baron B. 
t Monastert! 
He introduces two feudal barons—Barons A. and B.—each 
living on his own estate. These estates are rapidly represented by 
rough irregular outlines on the blackboard and the feudal strong- 
hold of each marked by a ring or tower within them. 
A few questions then revise some of the facts of feudal 
P

226 The School, the Child, and the Teacher : 
land letting and holding. From whom did the barons obtain the 
land? On what terms? The “dues” claimed for wardship, 
marriage, and in case of a king’s tenant dying without a will, or 
being found guilty. of treason, are remembered, The teacher then 
proceeds with a little fiction: Baron A. is under fifty, married 
young, has two sons of age, two daughters married ; he is business- 
like, his affairs are all in order, arrangements for the disposal of his 
property made in accordance with the law ; and he is very loyal. 
‘What are the king’s chances of getting money from this baron? — 
The pupils see that they are extremely small. . 
- Baron B., on the contrary, is verging on filty—a great age in the 
thirteenth century—and is besides in poor health. He had married 
late ; his eldest’son is only fifteen and has inherited his father’s 
feeble constitution; his three daughters, who may become heiresses, 
are still unmarried. The baron is unbusinesslike, too, and keeps 
. putting off the making of his will; he is moreover suspected of 
treason. What are the king’s expectations in his case? Very 
great, the pupils see. Baron B. is much the more profitable tenant. 
But now if he—in poor health, as the children remember, and 
of a religious disposition—begins as he grows older to see much of 
the neighbouring abbot and finally, disinheriting his children, leaves 
all his property to the monastery [entered thus | as mentioned] 
on his estate, what becomes of the king’s chances of profiting ? 
They vanish. For, it must be made clear to the children, the mon- 
astery has no sons under age, no daughters to marry ; can incur 
no fines for dying without a will—for corporations cannot die—and 
none for treason, as monks do not rebel. If many nobles follow 
the example of Baron B. the king’s income will be considerably 
lessened. How is he to prevent this? Why clearly, by making a 
law against the passing of property into such “ dead hands ”— 
“ dead ” as far as the king is concerned, for they put no money into 
his coffers. The class is now ready for the statement quoted above. 
As Mr. Keatinge says: “Its abstract nature has vanished.” 
Again, speaking of the indifference, if not actual dislike, with 
which children are apt to regard religious law-making, the same 
writer shows how it is possible—as it is very necessary, for in some 
periods of history the whole situation depends upon the religious 
question—to ensnare attention even to Elizabeth’s Act of Uni- 
formity :
-P-A-G-E-240
A ee The Teaching of History 227 
“ Drake’s father was a chaplain in the Royal Navy in the reign 
of Edward VI, and the sailors in the South of England seem in 
general to have been Protestants, probably because their opponents 
the Spaniards were on the Catholic side. It was from the captain 
of a Huguenot privateer in the Spanish Main that Drake learned 
of the massacre of St. Bartholomew, and later on, his adventures 
give the teacher an opening for revising the Act of Uniformity. 
Drake has returned from Nombre de Dios, has come to anchor off 
Plymouth, and sends a boy on shore to announce his arrival. It 
happens to be Sunday morning, and the boy finds the worthy in- 
habitants of Plymouth in church. He sings out to them that Drake 
is back, upon which they promptly leave the parson to preach to 
empty benches and rush down to the shore to catch the first sight 
of his ship. 
“No matter how lamely he may tell the story of Drake’s ex- 
ploits, and of this dramatic home- coming, the teacher will have no 
difficulty in riveting the whole attention of his class, and here he 
can switch them off on to the Act of Uniformity. What was the 
interior of the church like? Was there a crucifix? Were vest- 
ments worn? Were all the citizens there ? What was the penalty 
if they absented themselves? ‘The interest engendered by the 
“Sea Dog’ narrative will be transferred to the greyer matter of 
religion, and though it will evaporate by degiees, some minutes 
may elapse before the class realise that a march has been stolen upon 
them, and that they are paying whole-hearted attention to a subject 
hitherto regarded with suspicion.” (Studies in the Teaching of 
History, Keatinge.) 
‘Here we have two instructive examples of how interest may be 
aroused by beginning “ at the child’s end ”—with something with 
which his own experience or interests may bring him into touch— 
even when the subject seems at first glance very remote from him. 
' In South African history such connections may be made be- 
tween the many types of humanity seen in Capetown streets and 
the successive events accounting for their presence ; between the 
present Malay inhabitants of Capetown and neighbourhood and 
the introduction of slaves and Asiatics ; between the name Hugue- 
not, so familiar in the Western Cape Province, and the religious 
contest in France which led to the coming of the French settlers ; 
between the distrust and dislike of Roman Catholicism exhibited
-P-A-G-E-241
228 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
from time to time, and Holland’s long struggle with the Roman 
Catholic powers of Spain and France ; between the trekking habit 
of modern times and the irksomeness of Company rule in the early 
days of Dutch occupation ; between Western and Eastern Cape 
Province differences, and their mode of settlement. 
This ability to trace the past from the present will grow by 
exercise. What is needed at the beginning is a recognition of the 
continuity there is in all national development, and a knowledge of 
those enduring traits of human nature which link generation to 
generation and ensure interest whenever this subject is taught as 
human story.

CHAPTER X 
NATURE STUDY 
“The world is so fall of a number of things, 
T’m sure we should all be as happy as kings.” 
—R. L, STEVENSON, 
“The country should become an outer, uncovered classroom—a Divine 
museum utilised by our teachers.” —RUSKIN. - 
“ Nature study is learning those things that are best worth knowing to the 
end of doing those things that make life most worth living.”--HopcE. 
In an earlier chapter it was said that one effect of our teaching must 
be to keep gladness alive in the hearts of young children, and to 
help older ones to recover, if they have lost it, their sense of the 
wonder and beauty of the world. No subject of the school course 
offers us such ready means of doing this as does nature study. 
To very young children the days are a succession of delightful 
discoveries—discoveries of new things and of new powers. To each 
new thing they give for the moment close attention ; each new 
power they exercise until they tire. They are exploring their own 
little corner of the great world of nature, and the days are not long 
enough for them to see and do all that there is to be seen and done. 
Almost all children seem to lose something of their happy ab- 
sorption in the world about them as they pass out of infancy ; and, 
three or four years later, many seem to have little interest in it left. 
As teachers we may well ask ourselves why ; for it is the answer to 
this question that must guide our nature work in school. 
The very young child is in a world which constantly offers him 
something new. On each new thing in tum he exercises such powers 
of observation as he has, chiefly by looking and handling, though, 
in some cases, by listening, tasting, or smelling. Nothing, however, 
chains his attention for long : 
. .. this has now his heart, 
And unto this he frames his song, 
But it will not be long . 
Ere this be thrown aside, 
231
-P-A-G-E-245
232 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
and it is only by reason of the “ number of things ” to be seen and 
done that he is kept from tiring. . Throughout infancy he keeps 
coming into touch with the same things day after day and day after 
day ; and, by degrees, if he is left to himself, his delight in them and 
his wonder at them begin to abate. Things are growing familiar. 
He has found out as much as he is able, unaided, to find out about 
them ; and, unless some one steps in to show him that he has not 
really seen all that there is to be seen, or in some other way to re- 
awaken his interest, familiarity will breed indifference. A child 
observes rightly as far as he is able ; but, in the absence of train- 
ing, his observation does not show him very much. Beyond a 
certain point, training or some special urging is needed to carry 
him forward to new discoveries. 
Our first aim, then, when we begin nature study with very young 
children who have just come to school, should be to help them to 
pursue the discoveries which have kept them busy and happy at 
home—in the house or garden, about the farm or out on the veld. 
This will lead us to ask to what kind of things their attention is 
most readily drawn. Anything “alive ” interests them, whether it is 
more alive like an animal or Jess alive like a plant. Animals and 
plants, therefore,should have the first placeamong theirnaturestudies 
in school; and, because of our pupils’ greater interest in animals, 
these should be chosen for the subject of them more frequently. 
Little children delight, too, in the sunshine, and in the flowers and 
birds and butterflies which come with it after rain; they may be 
heard exclaiming over the beauty of moon and stars. The wind 
that buffets them and the rain that drenches them have each made 
an impression on their minds. They have wondered “‘ What makes 
the wind blow?” and “ Where do the clouds come from ? ” so 
that we shall find it easy, if we go the right way to work, to keep 
them interested while we help them to find such answers to their 
questions as they can understand at their age. There will be place, 
then, for lessons on the weather and the seasons. 
Closely bound up with our wish to help the children to see more 
than they can do alone, there must be the desire to help them to feel 
in new ways and in new directions. Little children’s feelings are 
naturally centred in themselves. It cannot be otherwise until 
they have more knowledge of life than they possess as infants. 
The only needs and desires they are aware of in the first 
year or two in life are their own. We cannot be surprised, there-
-P-A-G-E-246
Nature Study 233 
fore, that their efforts are given mainly to satisfying these needs 
and gratifying these desires. As they grow out of babyhood, 
however, they must be helped to realise the needs and desires of 
others. In schools the nature study course provides a means of 
doing this, and the training possible through it should be adapted 
to the various stages of their growth. 
The animal studies suited to the infant room cannot be success- 
fully made unless a number of animals are kept in or about the 
school. The presence of these will afford opportunity for the very 
training that our little pupils need. If an animal seems unhappy 
under the conditions provided they must be altered, or it must be 
set free from captivity. Thus the children will see that the happiness 
of animals must be thought of as well as their own ; and, in time, 
the feeling will grow that they ought to release a pet if they are 
  unable to make it happy. There are many animals—as, for 
example, white rabbits, rats and mice, and certain birds—that 
have been bred in captivity, and it is no unkindness to keep these 
if we keep them in comfort. There are others—bees in their hives 
and ants in their self-made heaps—which can be left at liberty 
within the school grounds, and can therefore be studied under the 
best possibte conditions. Others still, are unaware of captivity 
if it is not too close. Frogs in tubs, caterpillars and silkworms 
developing in gauze-fronted boxes, and small fish in artificial ponds 
will yield some of the most instructive studies. Again, domestic 
pets, such as the cat and dog, can be brought into the classroom for 
the purpose ofa lesson ; anda hen and chicks can usually be studied 
neat the school. There is no need, therefore, for our pupils to see the 
unkindness of a forced captivity practised in the name of nature 
study. All animals should, during captivity, be given as much air, 
space and freedom as possible, and the greatest attention should 
be paid to their feeding and cleansing. At first the children can 
only watch what is being done for the animals’ comfort; but as soon 
as they are old enough they should be taught to help in the work of 
feeding them and keeping them clean. This is the very best way 
' of developing that thought and care for others’ feelings which we 
wish to see in them. A word or two on the subject now and then 
may do something to awaken sympathy ; steady, continuous ex- 
ample of kindness will do more ; but most will be accomplished by 
training our pupils themselves to little, thoughtful, kindly acts on 
behalf of others.
-P-A-G-E-247
234 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
Just as a “zoo” is the first necessity of animal study by 
infants, so a garden is the first necessity of plant study. Through 
these, also, the children may learn to think of and attend to wants 
other than their own ; for plants need food,.water, air, and light 
as animals do, and their drooping condition in the absence of 
these is a reproach to those entrusted with the care of them, that 
little children may readily be made to feel. The plots need not be 
large, and may suitably be made in a corner of the playground, or 
in bord@s surrounding the school building. What is needed is some 
place where the children can grow plants under natural condi- 
tions~set seeds, watch and tend their growth, and so lay the 
foundations for later study. Side by side with this outdoor 
work, the germination of small seeds on damp flannel or blotting 
paper, and of large ones in pots, glass jars, or tins filled with 
watered moss, damp sawdust or mould, should go on in the 
classroom. Seedlings in pots and window-boxes should be cared 
for, and our pupils should be encouraged to bring plants of their 
own growing and tending for the brightening of the schoolroom. 
Weather observations should make the children familiar with 
the broad difference between summer and winter conditions with 
regard to sun, rain and wind. Their attention should be drawn to 
the seasons as they pass, and changes in plant and animal life should 
be pointed out in connection with each. Spring is naturally the 
best time for beginning the scheme of study planned. It should 
be shown, as the season of the springing of new life, and lessons 
which turn the children’s thoughts to this recurrent wonder should 
be given. Summer should be shown to them as the time of growth 
and activity, and the heat of the sun should be noted. It is the 
best time for studying the sunshine-lovers among animals. Autumn 
may be presented as the harvesting season. The time of vigorous 
growth is over, and the later crops are ripe and ready for harvesting. 
Lessons on the food-storers among animals have a special interest 
at this season. Winter should be characterised as th st 
season of the year, the time when most plants and som 
rest in sleep. Domestic animals may be the special s. 
study in this season. : 
No part of nature-study is more important than that whic 
deals with the health of the human body. At this stage simpl 
talks on the cleanliness of hands, face, hair, teeth and nails are mos' 
suitable: We must see that where need is these talks have due effec
-P-A-G-E-248
  Nature Study : 235 
In these early years our treatment of chosen subjects must be. 
very simple. It should not greatly differ from the children’s. own 
methods of examining the things they see round about them. It 
should only go a little further, pointing out features that they would 
be likely to overlook, and now and then suggesting the reasons for 
them. We must not forget, however, that some features are of too 
detailed a character to appeal to the observing powers of young 
children. These should be left for examination during later studies. 
Let us take an example. Little children will discover for them- 
selves that the fur of their kitten is soft and warm ; that she has 
four legs and a tail. If they are in the habit-of pulling the tail they 
will probably have had forced upon their attention the fact that her 
feet are furnished with sharp claws. They will know a little about 
her habits—what she likes to eat and drink, how she spends most 
of her time during the day—but their observations will not have 
shown them much more. They will very likely not have noticed 
her noiseless walk, nor the colour of her eyes, nor the roughness of 
her tongue. These, as characteristic features, should be pointed 
out, attention being drawn in the case of the first to the little pads 
beneath the feet, though their number may be neglected at this 
stage. With regard to the eyes, again, it will be sufficient to advise 
them to look at kitty when it is nearly dark, and to suggest that the 
gleam of her eyes then, helps her to see, This will lead up to an 
explanation of why she sleeps so much in the daytime. The con- 
tracting of a cat’s eyes in the light is not a point for observation at 
this stage; but the children will like to feel her rough tongue if 
she can be persuaded to lick their fingers, and this may be referred 
to her habits. A first lesson need attempt nothing more, though 
questioning will reveal a few individual observations that will 
interest the class as a whole. All early teaching should be more 
in the nature of informal talks than of formal lessons. We must 
never lose sight of our pupils’ need to come actually into touch 
through as many senses as possible with the subjects of study, 
which should be chosen from natural surroundings in home, garden, 
farm and country-side. 
The scheme of work will need very careful planning, for on the 
one hand it must avoid the mistake of following a formal classifica- 
tion—either of animals or plants—unsuited to the children’s years, 
and on the other must have some thread of association which con- 
nects the lessons throughout and prevents haphazard and discon-
-P-A-G-E-249
236 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
nected teaching. A successful scheme may be made in one of two 
ways. Wemay usea story as the base of our nature work, develop- 
ing it from lesson to lesson, and making studies of the various 
animals, plants, and phenomena that enter into it, and correlating 
these with other class subjects. In the hands of a born story- 
teller, there is little doubt that this story plan can be made very 
fascinating to little children, as it may introduce them to other little 
ones in whose lives, adventures, work and pleasures they will feel 
an absorbing interest. The story might tell, for instance, of a family 
of children, of their home life and out-of-door pleasures—their pets 
and their gardens, their walks and their visits to seaside, town and 
country, thus opening up a number of subjects for lessons and con- 
versations. It will be readily seen how drawing and modelling 
can be brought into the scheme. Language work may also be 
helped by it. New words used may be brought into writing and 
spelling lessons ; and poems and songs about the nature objects 
and aspects that have been mentioned in the story may be learnt. 
But where the teacher lacks the gift of story-telling, and has not 
acquired the power, it will be better for her to fall back upon the 
other plan. This is to make nature-study the base of the rest of 
the school work. Talks, reading, and the saying and singing of 
verses, writing, drawing, modelling and numbering should, accord- 
ing to this latter scheme, be brought into as close association as 
possible with the central subject, which should then be developed 
in close touch with the seasons. Whichever scheme is followed, 
drawing (free expression and studies of given subjects by freearm, 
freehand, and brushwork methods); modelling, story-telling, the 
saying of verses, the singing of songs and the playing of games 
must enter largely into it. Nature stories, poems and songs have 
a special value in this stage, for almost all that little children can 
learn of sun and mocn and stars, of wind and cloud and rain, must 
be presented to them in the fanciful fashion to which these lend 
themselves. 
When our pupils pass out of Standard I they will be ready, both 
because they are older than when they came to school, and because 
they have had some training both in looking at things and in telling 
about ‘them, for a rather more advanced form of nature-study. 
During the next three years it must be our aim to get them to look 
at things more closely, to notice more details than in their earlier 
study, and to notice them more accurately. We should in this  
-P-A-G-E-250
Nature Study 237 
stage provide more subjects for study, so that the children’s know- 
ledge of the world about them may be increased. Familiar sub- 
jects should be chosen, as before, and the children should be led to 
draw conclusions from their own personal observations. At the 
same time we must bring the other subjects of the school course— 
which are treated more formally in these standards than in the 
Sub-Standards and Standard I—into the closest possible relation 
with the nature work, so that all may help together in the training 
of our pupils. They should have a nature reader, or, failing this, 
we should choose for special study such nature lessons and verses 
as occur in the reader they have; we should also choose some 
nature poems for recitation. ‘Their oral and written compositions 
should frequently be on nature subjects. Problems in arithmetic 
should have to do with their garden work and other forms of 
nature-study; while much of their geography should be of the ob- 
servational nature which links it closely to this subject. Topical 
history lessons should be concerned with the ways of life of 
ancient peoples; and their hunting, pastoral; and agricultural 
pursuits will furnish further opportunity of bringing it into relation 
to natural knowledge. 
The treatment of subjects need not be so simple at this stage, 
but it must always be of such a nature that the children understand 
the teaching and are interested by it. Aim and method should 
vary slightly with the standard taught. In Standard IT we should 
try to get our pupils to observe accurately, but not in great detail, 
and to train them to see the subjects of their studies as a whole, 
noting in what respects each differs from others. We should, 
therefore, get them to make simple comparisons, such, for example, 
as are possible between a cat and a dog, or between trees and shrubs. 
Our method should be Jess conversational than in the Sub-Standards 
and Standard I, and we should require the beginnings of continuous 
oral description from our pupils. In Standard JII new studies 
related to the work in geography should be added, our pupils’ 
attention at this stage being drawn to the world outside their home, 
farm, village or town. They should also be led to discover the value 
to man of the subjects of their study, and the comparisons made 
should keep this in view. Simple classification should begin at 
this point, and the first grouping of plants and animals should be 
based on use toman. Longer oral descriptions than in the previous 
standard should be required, and conversational lessons should be
-P-A-G-E-251
238 © The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
less frequent. In Standard IV the children must go on from the 
point reached to further inquiries. They must be led to look for 
the causes of what they see in nature. Lessons and studies should 
no longer.be mainly concerned with animals and plants. Our pupils 
must be led to feel an interest in inanimate nature (rocks, hills, 
valleys, &c.), and in natural forces (water, wind and frost). The 
sun, the moon and the Southern Cross should be the first subjects 
ofsky study. Interest in living things should be turned to the dis- 
tribution of plant and animal life, and to the effect of this on the 
life of man. More should be attempted in the way of classifica- 
tion,this being possible through the more detailed examination of 
the plants and animals chosen for study. 
In this stage of their growth children are specially interested in 
work and its results. This we should bear in mind in teaching 
them, and it should affect. both the choice and treatment of our 
studies. Our pupils will at this time turn eagerly to the activities 
of animal life, and we should provide for them studies of such busy 
workers as the bee and the ant. In studying other animals they 
will be most drawn to that part of the study which requires some 
activity on their own part, and where they have opportunity will 
show a practical interest in the care and feeding of them. It will 
be possible to give them such opportuntiy in connection with the 
animals of the school “ zoo,” and this should be done. In studying 
the life histories of frogs, fishes, caterpillars and silkworms, children 
of this age will delight in supplying the proper conditions for 
development, as in seeing to change of water, or cleaning of boxes 
and provision.of food. Such life histories should therefore enter 
largely into their studies. They will also be specially interested 
in animals as servants or enemies of man. : 
In connection with plant life they will be specially interested in 
the school garden and the care of their own plot, both on account 
of the work these provide and of the practical results yielded 
through the flowers, fruits and vegetables grown. Further use 
should therefore be made at this time of the school garden, and 
the children should be held wholly or partly responsible for their 
own plots. Life histories of plants from seed to seed will furnish 
them with an enjoyable form of study, as these entail both the 
tending of the plants and the recording by means of notes and] 
Grawings of the facts observed. Tree planting, also, will appeal t 
them. :
-P-A-G-E-252
    Nature Study 239 
In weather and seasonal observations the records and nature 
calendars to be made will provide lower standard children with the 
occiupation that is a necessity of their nature in these years, and 
this side of the work should therefore be emphasized. ‘The sun 
and the moon, frost, snow, hail, rain, thunder and wind should all 
be made the subjects of records, while nature calendars should 
record, and show by drawings, certain seasonal occurrences. 
Hygiene lessons will be made interesting to children at this age 
when they are of such a nature that practical effect can be given 
to them. This should be easiest, of course, when they relate to 
matters of personal cleanliness ; but in this, habit plays a large part, 
and is sometimes difficult to overcome. Lessons on ventilation and 
house sanitation may lead the children to exercise their practical 
capacity in the interests of health, and this side of “ nature” work 
(for it is closely concerned with human nature) will then have good 
results. 
But while we are careful to supply matter and methods of study 
that will appeal to the practical capacity of pupils in this stage of 
development, we must be equally careful to see that what is prosaic 
in life and nature does not obscure from them the true romance 
and poetry of these. We must remember that the concentration 
upon activity and usefulness which is a characteristic of the stage 
of childhood, will be apt to dull the “ celestial light ” through which 
“the earth, and every common sight’? may be seen to shine, 
Whether it does so for our pupils as a result of their nature-study, 
will depend to a very large extent on our treatment of our chosen 
studies. There is a wonderful side to the life of the bee and the 
activity of the ant ; there is romance in the story of the domestica- 
tion of animals ; the life history of the humblest creature may well 
make us marvel ; the springing of a leaf in bare earth, the opening 
of a bud on the bough above it, the unfolding of the petals of a 
flower, are miracles which should never become mere matters of 
fact to us or to our pupils. The shining of sun, moon, and stars ; 
the singing and moaning of the winds, the sweep and glint of rain 
should appeal to our sense of beauty, and the interaction of these 
great forces and its effect on life should appeal to our sense of 
wonder. These aspects of “ common things ” must be visible to 
our own eyes and minds, and we must make them visible to the eyes 
and minds of our pupils. This is necessary in all stages of school 
nature-study. It is especially necessary at the time when, during
-P-A-G-E-253
240 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
a stage of their growth, our pupils may be blinded to the beauty 
and wonder of nature. 
The cultivation of reasoning and definite method should be our 
intellectual aim in nature lessons when we pass from lower to upper 
standard classes. Our pupils at this stage should be able to make 
personal investigations without the help given to them as juniors. 
They should also, in writing their notes (which, again, they should 
do unaided) arrange them with system and method as a result of 
their earlier training in observing and describing. 
Less will be expected, naturally, of Standard V in these 
respects than of Standards VI and VII, and our aim and method 
should vary somewhat in consequence. The scope of chosen 
studies should also be extended in passing upwards to the highest 
standard. In Standard V exercise for the reasoning powers 
should be provided, and classification should therefore take a more 
important place in the study of animals and plants. In the study 
of inanimate nature the laws controlling natural forces should be 
studied, and inquiry made into the cause of observed effects, as, 
for example, into that of the recurrence of the seasons. Study 
of the composition and value of minerals, and of the interchange of 
natural and manufactured products, will suitably link the work 
of this standard with geography, while lessons on the import- 
ance of inventions and discoveries will associate it with history. 
Systematic study and actual practice of garden operations should 
go on side by side with classroom study. In Standard VI effort 
should be devoted to perfecting the objects outlined in Standard V, 
the work laying the foundations for a scientific course of training. 
The study and appreciation of beauty in nature should here be 
carried on through the drawing of animal and plant forms. The 
problems of animal and plant growth should be attacked in the 
systematic and scientific manner proper to this stage of develop- 
ment. The aim demands, too, a more systematic course in physio- 
logy and hygiene than is attempted in the lower standards, and 
the pupils are thus. brought into touch with elementary chemistry 
and physics. The interrelations of plant and animal life con- 
sidered from the standpoint of the distribution of man and the 
lower animals on the earth, should be studied to further the 
cultivation of reasoning. Related to this study is that of climate 
and its influence on man and his food-supplies, in the consider- 
ation of which, examples may be plentifully drawn from the
-P-A-G-E-254
  Nature Study 241 
geography of the standard. ‘The inventions of man for making 
easier cultivation, transport, and manufacture of food and 
clothing, should be discussed as showing the practical result of 
scientific thought, and so emphasizing the value of the reasoning 
and method required at this stage. In country districts special 
emphasis should be given to all these matters in their relation 
to farming, local conditions deciding the choice of subjects. 
In Standard VII nature work requires consideration from two 
points of view—from that of pupils finishing their education in the 
rural school, and that of others about to leave it and pass on to the 
more advanced study possible in High Schools. It is with the 
former that we have to do. 
For rural pupils nature study should assume a practical form, 
and the knowledge acquired be applied to solving the problems of 
living, with which they will soon be confronted. The bearing of 
home, farm, and market on each other must be considered prac- 
tically, questions of labour, produce and price being looked into. 
The end in view may be approached by exercises in practical 
arithmetic and mensuration, simple surveying, and manual practice 
in garden and workshop ; by the study of geography in its com- 
mercial and broader physical aspects, as, for example, the relation 
between climate and productions, and the chances of the emigrant 
in various parts of the world, and by the closer study of scientific 
farming. In short, this last year should equip pupils for the pro- 
blems and battles of life, and train them to think and act as inde- 
pendent beings. ° 
A special feature of the work throughout the upper standards 
must be the making of original notes from direct observation, and 
original sketches illustrating the subjects of study under natural 
conditions. Insistence on good method in setting down notes and 
making sketches is a very important part of the training. The art 
of intelligent note-making—valuable in so many departments of 
adult life—has been mastered by very few pupils of school-leaving 
age, and the fact is due to want of proper training in the upper 
standards. 
But we must beware that we do not allow our pupils’ joy in 
nature to be buried beneath a weight of scientific method and 
commercial detail. Our best way of preventing this will be to 
bring their nature study at this stage into close relation with 
their study of literature, making them acquainted with the nature- 
Q
-P-A-G-E-255
242 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
lovers among the great poets. It is poetry rather than science 
that will help them to gain what we wish them to have as a sure 
possession before they pass from school into the world—an 
awakened sense of the beauty and wonders of nature. Two or 
three times in the week, instead of using their ordinary readers, 
we should bring to class from the school library, or our own, a book 
in which we have previously marked a poem or passage that has a 
nature interest. At first we should choose poems or prose pieces 
that bring out the beauty of things daily apparent to our senses 
and yet by most of us unwondered at. Very suitably we may 
take that poem of Robert Louis Stevenson which expresses the 
difference in the look the earth wears for those who do-not and 
those who do see with something of the poet’s vision. It begins 
with a plaint : 
“A naked house, a naked moor, 
A shivering pool before the door, 
A garden bare of flowers and fruit 
And poplars at the garden foot: 
Such is the house that I live tn, 
Bleak without and bare within.” 
And the poet answers it with : 
“ Yet shall your ragged moor receive 
The incomparable pomp of eve, 
And the cold glories of the dawn 
Behind your shivering trees be drawn ; 
And when the wind from place to place 
Doth the unmoored cloud-galleons chase, 
Your garden gloom and gleam again, 
With leaping sun, with glancing rain. 
Here shall the wizard moon ascend 
The heavens, in the crimson end 
Of day’s departing splendour, here, 
The army of the stars appear. 
The neighbouring hollows, dry or wet, 
Spring shall with tender flowers beset, 
And oft, the morning muser see 
Larks rising from the broomy lea, 
And every fairy wheel and thread 
Of cobweb, dew-bediamonded. 
When daisies go, shall winter time 
Silver the simple grass with rime ; 
Autumnal frosts enchant the pool 
And make the cart-ruts beautiful ;
-P-A-G-E-256
Nature Study 243 
And when snow-bright the moor expands 
How shall your children clap their hands. 
To make this earth our hermitage 
A cheerful and a changeful page, 
God’s bright and intricate device 
Of days and seasons doth suffice.” 
The poem, of course, was written of another country than this ; 
but here, as there, for eyes that can see, the “ bright and intricate 
device of days and seasons ” lends beauty to the barer places of 
earth—here, as there, are “ sun, moon, and stars, all sweet things,” 
and “ always the wind on the heath.” And in one particular at 
least, South Africa has a beauty far beyond what is seen in Britain. 
To those of us who have come from the greyer north, it seems as 
if we had never known before how “ incomparable ” is “ the pomp 
of eve ”—-how magnificent are the “ glories of the dawn,” and the 
blue of the sky and the perpetual sunshine. 
The opening lines of Keats’ Endymion might be chosen next. 
“ A thing of beauty is a joy for ever: 
Its loveliness increases; it will never 
Pass into nothingness ; but still will keep 
A bower quiet for us, and a sleep 
Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. 
Spite of despondence, "of the inhuman dearth 
Of noble natures, of the gloomy days, 
Of all the unhealthy and o’er-darkened ways 
Made for our searching : yes, in spite of all, 
Some shape of beauty moves away the pall 
From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon, 
Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon 
For simple sheep ; and such are daffodils 
With the green world they live in; and clear rills. 
And such too is the grandeur of the dooms 
We have imagined for the mighty dead ; 
All lovely tales that we have heard or read ; 
An endless fountain of eternal drink, 
Pouring unto us from the heaven’s brink.” 
Later we should try to fit our passages more closely to some 
special study. In these standards our pupils study the seasons 
and climate, winds and rainfall. Their nature study would fail 
to have its full effect if their thoughts of them were bounded by 
scientific explanations concerning the inclination of the earth’s
-P-A-G-E-257
244 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
axis, latitude and altitude, and proximity to water surfaces. It is 
of more moment to them that they should realise, with Words- 
worth, that “the sunshine is a glorious birth” ; see Autumn, with 
Keats, as the 
“ Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness ! 
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun, 
Conspiring with him how to load and bless 
With fruit, the vines that round the thatch-eaves run,” 
and apprehend, with Shelley, the winds as spirits of the dying or 
reviving year—one, “ charioteering to their dark wintry bed” 
“The wingéd seeds, where they lie cold and low, 
Each like a corpse within its grave, until 
[His] azure sister of the spring shall blow 
Her clarion o’er the dreaming earth, and fill 
(Driving sweet buds like flocks to feed in air) 
With living hues and odours plain and hill.” 
or, like Ruskin, looking on a sodden landscape, see it as the work 
of “ the great angel of the sea—rain.” 
This linking of nature study with literature is the best means, 
too, of revising and adding to the knowledge gained from earlier 
studies. The activities of the honey-bee, for example, form a 
suitable study for lower standards, but children in these standards 
are quite unable to realise how wonderfully organised is the social 
life of the bee. Upper standard pupils, however, may be helped 
to an appreciation of the work of the hive by reading well-chosen 
passages from Maeterlinck’s Life of the Bee, as one or two passages 
may serve to show. 
“ Day after day, at the first hour of sunrise, the explorers of the 
dawn return, and the hive awakes to receive the good news of the 
earth. ‘The lime-trees are blossoming to-day on the banks of the 
canal.” ‘The grass by the roadside is gay with white clover.’ 
‘The sage and the lotus are about to open.’ ‘The mignonette, 
the lilies are overflowing with pollen.’ Whereupon the bees must 
organise quickly and arrange to divide the work. Five thousand 
of the sturdiest will sally forth to the lime-trees while three thousand 
juniors go and refresh the white clover. Those who yesterday 
were absorbing nectar from the corollas will to-day repose their 
tongue and the glands of their sac and gather red pollen from the|
-P-A-G-E-258
Nature Study 245 
mignonette, or yellow pollen from the tall lilies ; for never shall 
you see a bee collecting or mixing pollen of a different colour or 
species, and indeed one of the chief preoccupations of the hive is 
the methodical bestowal of these pollens in the store-rooms in 
strict accordance with their origin and colour. Thus does the 
hidden genius issue its commands. The workers immediately 
sally forth, in long black files, whereof each one will fly straight to 
its allotted task. 
“ Let us go on, then, with the story of our hive ; let us take it up 
where we left it ; and raise as high as we may a fold of the festooned 
curtain in whose midst a strange sweat, white as snow and airier 
than the down of a wing, is beginning to break over the swarm. 
For the wax that is now being born is not like the wax that we 
know ; it is immaculate, it has no weight ; seeming truly to be the 
soul of the honey, that itself is the spirit of the flowers. And this 
motionless incantation has called it forth that it may serve us, 
later—in memory of its origin doubtless, wherein it is one with the 
azure sky, and heavy with perfumes of magnificence and purity— 
as the fragrant light of the last of our altars.” (Chapter VI: The 
Foundation of the City—the most suitable chapter for class reading.) 
We can glean from a very wide field for passages that bear in 
this way on the special nature studies taken in our classes. There is 
no need of class copies of the books from which we take them ; for, 
as has been pointed out, in upper standard classes it is a good thing 
if, sometimes, the only book used is in the hands of the reader. We 
are therefore free to choose from any book that is even temporarily 
in our possession. We need not fear lack of interest on the part of 
our pupils, for “ none more than children are concerned for beauty,” 
and, having seen it through the eyes of others, they will learn to look 
for it with their own and to recognise it when they find it. Thus 
having been drawn from nature to books, they will be drawn again 
from books to nature with eyes better able to see and emotions 
more readily stirred, so mastering at length the last lesson nature 
has to teach—the reality of her “‘ serene and gladsome influence ” 
on the mind of man.

CHAPTER XI 
THE TEACHING OF GEOGRAPHY 
“I should like to rise and go 
‘Where the golden apples grow ;~- 
Where below another sky 
Parrot islands anchored lie. 
d Where in sunshine reaching out 
Eastern cities, miles about, 
Are with mosque and minaret 
Among sandy gardens set, 
And the rich goods from near and far 
. Hang for sale in the bazaar.” ——R. L. STEVENSON. 
‘* Geography treats of physical reality, with which the child comes into 
direct contact only through sense-perception. The teaching of geography 
must therefore be founded upon the child’s own knowledge of his immediate 
urroundings. .. . Upon actual observation of his own surroundings .. . 
the deepening and enrichment of this knowledge of the world will, in the 
main, depend throughout his whole school course. To the process of ex- 
tending his knowledge of that same world by direct observation, there are 
obvious limits . . . but long before these limits are reached we shall begin to 
enlarge the child’s horizon through his imagination by means of stories and 
descriptions aided by pictures, models, and maps.” —Scottish Memorandum on 
the Teaching of Geography. 
We have seen how important the teaching of history is in the train- 
ing of future citizens. As a closely-related subject, dealing with the 
causes of so many of the events that fill the pages of history, the 
study of geography is of equal importance, for it is needed to 
cultivate in our pupils a sound judgment in matters that are 
influenced by geographical conditions. To this end it is necessary 
that they should be familiar with many geographical facts and 
some geographical ideas, while the method by which such know- 
ledge is pursued will be found useful in everyday life. 
The interests of citizens of the British Empire, which is spread 
over the whole earth, are world-wide ; and, for this reason, their 
sympathies should be world-wide too. In all schools of the Empire, 
247
-P-A-G-E-261
248 ‘The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
therefore, the world at large is the proper subject of study in 
geography lessons. The subject, of course, may be regarded from 
many points of view; but the most important one for ordinary 
citizens educated in public elementary schools, is that which shows 
it as the scene of life, and, above all, as the scene of human life and 
of human relations which need careful consideration. 
In order that the subject may have the greatest value educa- 
tionally, the committing to memory of geographical facts must not 
be regarded as the chief aim and end of it. Some gain of knowledge 
of this sort must, of course, be looked for as a result of the teaching. 
There are some names, some features and some distances—the 
names, for instance, of the world’s continents and oceans, of its 
great rivers and mountain ranges; such features as the Strait 
of Gibraltar and the Isthmus of Suez; such distances as from 
Europe to America and across the North American Continent, and 
the time taken to voyage from Continent to Continent—which 
are expected to be known by every educated person, and the 
necessary time must, therefore, be given to them. But when the 
teaching of a mere fact is under consideration the question must be 
asked whether the knowledge of it has any value in the outside 
world, or is of use only in an examination room. Do newspapers 
expect their readers to possess it? Are the majority of well- 
educated people, outside school circles, familiar with it? Is it 
generally assumed to be known by grown-up people who have had 
a good schooling? If so, it must be taught or learnt. If not, 
the time that would be taken in mastering it must be kept for 
matters of greater importance. Geography, from first to last, 
should bring the student of it into close touch with the outside 
world of which it treats. Even when he must rely upon the 
discoveries of others who have travelled and explored where he has 
been unable to travel and explore, it must do this. It is only 
through his own earlier observations of the world about him that 
his imagination can give him a mental grasp of those parts of it 
which are removed from his sight. From the very beginning he 
must teach himself by using eyes in seeing, hands in representing, 
and mind in discovering what, how and why. He must search out 
his knowledge, not chiefly from his class text-book, but from the 
book of nature. 
The close relation between geography and other studies must be 
constantly borne in mind. As it deals with the natural features 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  The Teaching of Geography 249 
and conditions of the child’s surroundings, it keeps close to observa- 
tion lessons and nature work, which have their best result when 
they have these for their subject. The size of countries, the length 
of rivers, the height of mountains and the measurement of distances 
by the map scale connect the study with arithmetic; drawing is 
associated through the necessity of expressing graphically the 
observations on their natural surroundings which the pupils make 
in early years, and, later, of having to show by means of maps 
what they have learnt about more distant and larger areas. History 
cannot possibly be studied without reference to geographical con- 
ditions—to the nature of the country that affects through its 
climate, productions and industries the whole life of the nation, 
and, through its surface and boundaries, its communications and 
intercourse with neighbouring peoples. But history teaching 
should be connected with geography in more ways than one. In 
upper standards, where the subject is more formally treated, there 
must be constant references to the globe and map. Where possible, 
indeed, it is a good plan to teach the geography and history of a 
country in the same year, so as to be able to bring them into closer 
association. But the relation between the two subjects is most 
clearly seen in the progress of world history, and teaching on the 
movement of civilisation from East to West is as rightly con- 
sidered to belong to one as to the other. In the teaching of com- 
position, again, both oral and written exercises on the subject- 
matter of geography lessons, particularly where they more closely 
approach nature study, should be given. During reading lessons, 
globe, wall map, or atlas should be at hand if there is any reason to 
expect geographical references in the text. 
As the aim in teaching geography is, at the beginning, to make 
children observe for themselves, and to teach them how tozstimate 
distance and direction, outdoor lessons form an important part of 
the study from the outset. In these the subject is not merely 
related to nature study, but is, actually, nature study. It must, 
therefore, like all nature work, be dealt with as practically as 
possible. The whole of the syllabus of Standard II—which requires 
understanding of plans, knowledge of natural features in the neigh- 
bourhood of the school, and of the cardinal points of the compass— 
may be brought into the scheme of nature work. Later, in Standard 
III, the outlook becomes wider, the children advancing from the 
study of the home surroundings to the study of the geographical
-P-A-G-E-263

region in which the school is situated, part of which, at least, will 
be unknown to them. Here, therefore, more classroom work will 
be needed for the making of maps which represent the larger areas 
as plans do the smaller. Yet the actual observational work which 
makes geography one with nature study should be continued as far 
as possible.! This may be done by means of school excursions, in 
which the children make observations of as much of the country 
as possible, and, though these will need supplementing by our 
own knowledge, gained by personal observation or from other 
teachers of the division or from maps, the use of the method even 
so far will serve to keep the children in touch with actualities. 
While the development of geographical study in Standard IV and 
upwards takes the subject more into the sphere of the prepared map 
and printed text-book, even here it may be associated with nature 
study, both in matter and method. The actual features round the 
school should be studied as types of what is met with in the larger 
and more distant areas—local mountain ranges as bars to communi- 
cation, local poorts and valleys as rendering communication easy. 
Again, in studying the climate of any country or region, local weather 
observations should be used to keep the teaching from becoming 
merely abstract. The market produce of the district should give 
actuality to lessons on productions and industries. Local rivers, 
roads, and railways should be studied in connection with means of 
communication. The necessary facts about the form of the earth, 
and day and night, should be taught through actual observation 
of the sun’s rising and setting and of its path across the sky, while 
distance and direction and products in the neighbourhood of the 
school, and the reckoning of time, should be used to help the children 
to grasp what is taught them about latitude and longitude. Teach- 
ing on the seasons should provide observational work which will 
bring the causes of them under the notice of the pupils—the chang- 
ing position of sunrise and sunset throughout the year being noted ; 
the oblique rays in morning and evening, and in winter, being 
associated with cold ; the vertical rays at noonday and in summer 
with heat. Other observational exercises which suggest them- 
selves are the determining of a north and south line and of the sun’s 
- height at noon in different seasons of the year, the recording of the

varying length of the day, the making of temperature charts and 
the keeping of nature calendars. 
As we have seen, the study of geography is to bring children 
into touch with physical realities, and this can only be achieved 
if they are led to exercise their senses in observation of the 
world about them. The teaching of the subject must therefore be 
based upon their knowledge of the natural features of the earth 
near school and home, and be directed towards widening and deep- 
ening this. The fulfilment of both these aims must at first be 
sought through actual observation, and the more thorough and 
sound is this early work, the more accurate will be the ideas gathered 
later about distant parts of the earth. While the practice of actual 
observation must be carried on as long as the immediate subject 
of study permits of it, the aid of imagination must early be called 
in to widen the horizon of the pupils. The two processes of observ- 
ing and imagining must then go on side by side ; the one finding 
exercise in familiar sights and experiences, the other being 
stimulated by means of stories and descriptions illustrated by 
pictures, models and maps. Thus, even in the lowest classes, 
two types of lessons, based on observation and description respec- 
tively, are required, and both must be continued throughout the 
school course. These two factors in the study of the subject will 
be found constantly helpful to each other ; for “ the motive which 
impels the child to enlarge his knowledge is curiosity,” and, while 
“after babyhood curiosity is more readily excited by the distant 
than by the near, once aroused it can be reflected back upon the 
familiar so as to keep the sense of wonder fresh” (Scottish 
Memorandum on The Teaching of Geography). 
The secret of success, therefore, in teaching geography lies in 
keeping the balance even between these two sides of the work. 
While the greater part of our geographical knowledge is gained 
through description, oral or written, the observational work must 
form our grounding in the subject. We owe all descriptions in the 
first instance, to the personal observations of travellers or explorers, 
although the record of these may not reach us directly. What is 
important to remember is, that neither we nor our pupils can under- 
stand such descriptions exceptin the light of what we have observed 
for ourselves. In the study of geography the imagination must 
paint scenes and conditions that are true to actual fact, and this 
it cannot do unless scenes and conditions, similar in kind, though
-P-A-G-E-265
252 ‘The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
not in degree, have come under the observation of the senses. 
At the same time, unless imagination is brought to bear on the 
matter of observation, extending it beyond things seen into the 
region of the unfamiliar, true geographical study is never reached. 
We remain bound to the matter and method of nature study—to 
the study, that is, of such natural laws, forces, phenomena and 
productions as can be brought under our personal observation. 
. “From the first then, or almost from the first, these two aspects 
should develop abreast—the child’s conception of the great world 
growing more precise and coherent as his knowledge of his own 
little world grows wider and deeper” (Scottish Memorandum on 
The Teaching of Geography). 
In our scheme of instruction we must distinguish three stages 
of teaching—the first for children up to seven years, the second for 
junior scholars and the third for senior scholars. The first is a 
preparatory stage in which the children begin to observe their 
surroundings “as a whole and as they come,” not being expected 
to distinguish different aspects which later will resolve. themselves 
into separate subjects ; while, at the same time, stories and pictures 
are giving them ideas about strange peoples and distant lands. In 
the second stage the subject becomes more systematic, and the 
matter hitherto studied is recognised as belonging to three separate 
subjects—-history, nature study and geography—which are, from 
this point, developed on lines of their own, though always, as has 
been emphasized, in close relation with each other. Descriptive 
geography is continued in this stage, but with a difference, the 
people and lands—hitherto existing, without reference to globe or 
map, simply “‘ across the sea,” “ far from here,” or “ on the other 
side of the world ”—being now given “ a local habitation and a 
name.” The stage adapted to older scholars is intended to “ round 
off ” and render practical, in view of the approach of school-leaving 
age, such geographical knowledge as they have previously amassed, 
relating it to life and citizenship : ‘“ Though each stage has thus its 
characteristic features, there are no hard and fast dividing lines. 
Descriptive and pictorial methods will not be dropped suddenly 
when we pass from the first stage to the second; even in [the 
third stage] the pupils will still enjoy and profit by good stories well 
illustrated” (Scottish Memorandum on The Teaching of Geography). 
We must now consider the work of these stages in detail. 
Even of geography children have some knowledge when they
-P-A-G-E-266
  The Teaching of Geography 253 
come to school, and the wise infants’ teacher will set herself to 
discover the amount of this in order that she may see the best place © 
to begin and the best course to follow. From the time he learns to 
walk, every child is an explorer in a small way. In his home he 
learns where bedroom and dining-room and kitchen are; where 
his toys are kept, and, possibly, where his mother stores ber jam 
and other sweets. He is led, that is, from one place to another 
by his needs and desires. In ‘the garden and yard he knows where 
to look for the things that interest him most. By the time he comes 
to school, he probably knows fairly well the roads leading from 
his home into the village or town, or further into the country, and 
soon he comes to know very well, that which stretches between 
school and home. The starting-points for his study of geography 
are, therefore, easily seen to be the home and the school, and, as 
has been said, geography at first includes both history and nature 
study. The work in this stage, therefore, will deal with subject 
matter common to all these. 
Observational work at this time should be concerned with 
people—their look, dress, work and homes; with animals, plants, 
inanimate objects and weather conditions, and with land and 
water forms. All these may usefully be treated in talks, and 
the method suitable for these has been outlined in an earlier 
chapter. At the same time the children should be gaining by 
direct methods ideas of shape, size, position, slope, direction and 
distance. 
From the outset, rough representations of facts and features 
observed must be made by the children themselves. This may 
fitly begin by the making on the floor or on a horizontal 
blackboard of a model of the home and school and neighbour- 
ing roads and buildings, blocks and sticks being used for the pur- 
pose. The children should copy this model in sand on their 
trays, or make chalk or crayon drawings of it. Natural fea- 
tures—hill ranges, kopjes, valleys, plains—may also be modelled in , 
sand or some such substance as clay. Water forms—vleis, rivers, 
sea—may be tepresented either by the use of water, or in the case 
of a clay model, by colourirlg parts of the surface blue. Very simple 
records of weather observations should be kept, these being at first 
coloured and pictorial. The following scheme has been suggested 
for genera] use in this matter :

Such observations and representations are meant to serve a 
double purpose—first, to give the children a fairly correct idea of 
the position of noticeable features, both natural and constructed, 
and to teach the names of neighbouring streets, hills, buildings, etc. ; 
and, second, to impress on their minds examples of natural fea- 
tures which, later, will help them to imagine and understand the 
forms and forces met with in their world study. : 
A help to the realisation of what pictures descriptive of geo- 
graphy should paint for children at this stage will be found in the 
poem on Travel the opening lines of which are quoted at the head 
of this chapter. Robert Louis Stevenson was a poet who saw with 
a child’s eyes to the end of his life, and the poem paints with won- 
derful skill the world-pictures that may crowd the minds of imagi- 
native children, naming, as it does, one after another, the sights, 
sounds and smells that have fascination for them. 
In the descriptive lessons children should be taken—by means 
of stories and pictures—on imaginary travels to these wonderlands 
of fact, and have the scenes of cities, deserts, and jungles spread 
before them. Linked with their travels should be the myths, 
legends and true stories in which history takes its rise. No regular 
order need be observed in the telling of these stories. The chil- 
dren’s interests will place a guiding thread in our hands. These 
interests centre first round Man, and he should be met in various 
types and seen against different backgrounds—the Red Indian in 
his wigwam, the Eskimo on an icefield, the pastoral nomad with 
his flocks, the Chinaman on his rice patch, the Arab in the desert 
caravan. His occupation (hunting forest animals or sea-creatures, 
pasturing, cultivating or trading) will add to the interest felt in his 
looks (colour, form and dress) and his home, showing what manner 
ve, Published by Messrs. Longmans, Green & Co, in 4 Child’s Garden of 
erst,
-P-A-G-E-268

ee The Teaching of Geography 255 
of weapons or tools he uses, and what is the nature of his food. 
After Man, the animals that are his friends or servants will arouse 
eager interest—the familiar horse and dog, the stranger reindeer 
and camel—and after the animals, the plants he uses. Descrip- 
tions of occurrences and forces not experienced at home—iceberg, 
avalanche, earthquake, volcano—should be given, and pictures of 
them shown. Unfamiliar aspects of the homeland should also be 
treated by the descriptive method, the country thus being made 
familiar to town children, the town to rural pupils, and the sea to 
those born and bred inland. As has been suggested, quite inde- 
finite expressions—as, for example, “‘ Very far away,” “In a cold 
country by the sea ”—for the position of the lands described through 
their people and products, will suffice at this stage. When the 
map and globe are introduced in the systematic stage, localities 
will be definitely placed. . 
[Note.—A number of well-written and well-illustrated books, 
descriptive of actual places and peoples, are available as source 
books for this part of the work. Among these may be mentioned 
the series of Messrs. A. & C. Black, beginning with The Children’s 
World. If used as reference books by teachers of infant classes, 
and as readers in the standards, they could hardly fail to have a 
good effect in stimulating imagination and improving expression. 
The same publishers’ Visual Geography, a book of outline drawings 
—with brief notes—to be coloured by little pupils, should aid on 
the representative side of the work. Messrs. Blackie & Son have 
also a good series, of which the first two books—Lzitle Folk in many 
Lands and Tales and Travels—should prove helpful to teachers at 
this stage.] 
The teaching of the second stage must be adapted to the mind 
development and needs of children from eight to thirteen years 
of age. It is very necessary that, at the beginning of it, we should 
determine what-the children may be expected to know by the end 
of this stage, when a considerable number of them will be within 
sight of the end of their school life. It is not unreasonable to 
expect that they shall know the chief features of the great world 
divisions, shall have studied the countries of Europe—especially 
those more closely connected with South Africa—and of the British 
Empire in some detail, and have a still closer acquaintance with 
their own country. In addition, they should have some knowledge
-P-A-G-E-269
286 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
of the facts affecting the earth as a globe rotating and revolving 
in space, and of its relation to the sun. 
In this stage of the observational work, earlier ideas of distance 
and direction must be extended. The practice of ascertaining dis- 
tance by actual measurements must begin in such small areas 
as the classroom, by rough and ready methods ; but, as time goes 
on, proceeds by the use of measuring instruments for larger areas. 
Early in the stage the children must learn to express direction not 
by reference to their own persons, as earlier, but by the points of 
the compass. 
As the children shouldknowsomething about the earth’s motions 
they must continue their sky study, and this will bring them to the 
consideration of the earth as a globe rotating and revolving in space. 
Teaching on the shape of the earth should be introduced fairly 
early—as early, at least, as Standard IV—for while children of 
from ten to twelve years cannot be expected to appreciate the proofs 
of its roundness, it is very necessary that they should, as soon as 
possible, gain correct ideas of it as one of a number of globe-shaped 
bodies revolving round the sun. Proof of its surface curvature, 
such as is afforded by the differing heights of poles of equal length, 
set up at considerable distances from each other on level ground, 
is not likely to convince them. The characteristic manner in which 
approaching and departing ships are seen to appear above and dis- 
appear below the horizon is not much more likely to do so. In 
fact, while the majority of children of this age will be found ready 
to accept the fact that the earth is round, but few would appreciate 
- the reasoning by which it is reached. The best way of introducing 
the idea of its roundness is, as one of the foremost of modern geo- 
graphers, Mr. H. J. Mackinder, has pointed out, to refer to the 
apparent path of the sun in the sky, pointing to actual sun and 
earth, and not, at first, using globe or any devised apparatus. We 
should then question the children as to where the sun was before 
it rose, where it is after it has set, and how it gets back to its usual 
rising place. Gradually, the idea of a completed circular path, part 
visible and part invisible, will enter the children’s minds as they 
grasp the fact that the sun has—apparently—travelled round the 
earth, Then the idea of the earth as floating in space will begin 
to impress itself, and the fact—rarely realised by children——that 
there is a dome of changing sky above the other side of the earth 
as well as above our own. At this point drawings or objects may
-P-A-G-E-270
eT The Teaching of Geography 257 
be used.-for illustration, but there is always a danger that the chil- 
dren’s imaginings will be bound by them. At first we should speak 
as we do in ordinary conversation as if the sun really moved. We 
say ‘‘ The sun is coming up” and “ The sun has gone down,” and 
no harm is done by continuing this familiar way of speaking in our 
early geography lessons. Observation of the sun’s greater heat 
at noon and of the fact that a northward slope is hotter than a 
southward, should lead up to the connection between the shape 
and tilt of the earth and the position of the hottest and coldest 
countries on its surface. 
As the recurrence of day and night is familiar, the teaching on 
its cause should be given fairly early. The lessons will most success- 
fully be given ina darkened room, The children should stand round 
the globe and should change their position at least once during the 
lesson, 
The mode of fixing position on a globe by means of two sets of 
lines cutting each other will be understood by Standard IV children 
if it is very simply treated. Latitude should be taught in relation 
to productions and longitude in connection with time, the matter 
being dealt with from the standpoint of South African time. 
Teaching on the seasons cannot be effectively given until after 
a year’s observations directed towards the place and time of sunrise, 
and sunset, and changes in the height of the sun. After a year’s 
direct observing and recording the two sets of observations should 
be related, when the connection between higher sun, longer day, 
warmer weather, and changes in plant and animal life and human 
occupations should be studied. Then because geographical studies 
are not completed until the knowledge gained from them has been 
applied to the conditions of life on the earth, the effect of the seasons 
on plant and animal life in widely different parts of the globe should 
be determined. 
Observation of weather changes and records of sunshine, tem- 
perature, wind, and rainfall should be continued and extended. 
Observations on the earth’s surface must be continued, attention 
being concentrated on natural features and on matters affecting 
plant and animal (especially human) life. The diagram, represent- 
ing the earth as a globe at four stages of its journeying in a very 
elliptical orbit, should not be used in teaching the seasons. It can 
only give wrong impressions. Up to Standard IV direct observation 
of the land surface in the school neighbourhood must give reality 
R
-P-A-G-E-271
258 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
to the knowledge acquired, so that when the pupils are advanced to 
the more systematic study of their own country they’ will be able 
to see it through the map which serves to represent it to them, and 
which will then be to them something more than “a number of 
dots and lines on a coloured surface.” In the teaching on these 
features it must be borne in mind that their names (with a formal 
definition) are very much less important than the nature of the 
things for which they stand. Thus: 
Inlets of the Coast—bays or gulfs—must be realised by the chil- 
dren as starting and stopping places for ships. 
Rivers as waterways making—if navigable—exploration, transit, 
cultivation, and industrial occupations easy, and settlement, there- 
fore, profitable. 
Straits as narrow connecting ‘passages between one large water 
area and another. 
Isthmuses as rendering artificial passages of the same kind pos- 
sible, exg., those of Suez and Panama. 
Islands as affording opportunity for intercourse and defence 
and characteristic occupations, and as aids to navigation. 
Capes as landmarks valuable in navigation. 
Mountains as natural defences, as barriers to communication, 
,a8 causing (under certain conditions) rain, as the sources of rivers, 
as supplying material for fertilising lowlands, and bringing about 
changes in river valleys and lake basins. Many of these effects 
may be observed on a small scale in neighbouring ranges. Children 
know for themselves how difficult it is to reach a place that lies on 
the other side of the hills; they can watch clouds form and gather 
about the mountain tops, and can observe the muddy streams 
pouring down from them after rain. 
Valleys as sites for cultivation and settlement. 
Not all of these, of course, will fall to be studied in the earlier 
standards, for in II and III the children’s attention will be more 
profitably concentrated on those of the home and school region ; 
but a vei or dam, or the artificial pond in a park, may be made to 
help towards a realisation of the larger lake,and such possibilities for 
teaching by types should be taken advantage of whenever possible. 
By such observations as these, the underlying meanings and 
value of earth-study will be brought home to the pupils. Through 
sky-study they will come to conceive of the earth as a rotating planet 
revolving round the sun from which it receives light and heat. .The
-P-A-G-E-272
  The Teaching of Geography 259 
amount of heat it receives and the manner in which it-is lit, will be 
seen to be determined by its shape, the tilt of its axis, and its daily 
and yearly motions ; and life as it exists on the earth will be shown, 
to be influenced by these. Through weather observations, again, 
the children will gain true notions of the atmosphere—realising 
that it rotates with the earth and transmits light and heat and 
moisture to it, varying from day to day in its own temperature and 
in the amount of water vapour it contains. They may be helped 
to realise, too, that it is through the inter-relations of sun, air, land 
and water that life, as we know it, exists and continues. 
Observations of the material needs of human beings (food, cloth- 
ing, shelter), and the occupations supplying these, and of human 
customs and habits of life, should be added. 
Thus, gradually, the children may, through their. geography 
lessons, come to a view of life on the earth which, while by no means 
full or complete, leaves no aspect of it entirely unobserved or 
unillumined. 
Representation and observation must both be more accurate in 
this stage of the work, instruments being used when necessary. 
Both must be more extended, too, in order to show what has been 
learnt of the larger areas under study. 
The main object of mapping at this period is to make the chil- 
dren thoroughly acquainted with the usual methods of representing 
surface features used on globes and maps. The more accurate 
methods should be applied first to the school, its immediate sur- 
roundings and. neighbourhood, and then be gradually extended 
to all countries that form the matter of study. 
Plans of small areas such as the classroom, the schoolroom, and 
the immediate neighbourhood of the school should prepare our 
pupils for the next step in representation—a map of the geographical 
region in which the school is situated. This may be taken in two 
parts—one of the area with which the children are familiar, and the 
other of that which lies outside the field of their observation. - Ima- 
gination must here come into play to replace observation. In 
order to gain a true mental vision of the surface of those parts of 
the district which they have not seen the children should be shown 
first a “ relief” map of them, and then a “ bird’s-eye ” view. After 
this they should be ready to study and draw a map in which the 
ordinary mapping signs are used. Physica! and political aspects 
should: be: dealt with separately.
-P-A-G-E-273
260 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
The ruler work in the drawing syllabus of the lower standards 
will have enabled the children in Standard III to make the neces- 
sary advance on the freehand method of the preparatory stage ; and, 
accordingly, measurements should become more exact and the maps 
for which they are used more accurate. The children’s chief diffi- 
culty will be the representing of surface relief on the flat. In this, 
as has been suggested, the colour scheme of the atlas in use should 
be adopted. It will be necessary, however, for them at least to 
understand, if not actually to practise, alternative methods for 
showing raised masses of land—shading, feathering, and the thick 
line—because these are so generally used in maps met with in text- 
books and readers. 
The aim of this representative work is not so much to make the 
pupils expert in representing the surface features of a given stretch 
of country, as to make them familiar with the manner of map- 
making in order that they may read maps with ease—be able, that 
is, to visualise readily the actual features variously represented on 
them. No time can be spared for elaborate reproductions of de- 
tailed maps; but the ability to make a recognisable sketch map 
of a region under study must be steadily cultivated. In addition 
to ordinary map-making, exercises in filling in outline maps with 
given particulars should be set. The estimating and subsequent 
verifying, for example, of the course of rivers from the position 
of mountains previously entered, is valuable practice. The best 
course for a projected railway may be decided in the same way, 
or the natural lines of communication between one place and 
another may be entered. Such exercises in representation will aid. 
in the development of the idea of a map, and, as the children’s 
study is extended to wider areas and distant countries, the need 
for such records of their features—natural and artificial—will be 
recognised. Thus the recording of observations, at first crude and 
pictorial, will gradually become more accurate and more diagram- 
matic, and the children will pass naturally from the more concrete 
to the more abstract form as their minds develop. 
As in the earlier stage, this observational and representative work 
must accompany lessons conveying interesting ideas about distant 
countries and strange peoples. Such lessons as these must be 
illustrated as fully as possible by pictures and photographs of 
characteristic scenery, types of houses and other buildings, and of 
people in national costume; and by the examination of natural
-P-A-G-E-274
The Teaching of Geography — 261 
productions and typical manufactured articles, including national 
costumes, specimens of weapons, tools, toys, etc. The museum 
shelves should supply some of these, but children who have any 
in their homes—the harvest of some sailor or soldier relative’s 
travels—will take pleasure in bringing them to be shown in class. 
The story method of bringing countries and people before the 
children must still be employed ; but the transition to the syste- 
matic stage of treatment should be marked by the introduction of 
the globe, and more emphasis should be laid on lands than on 
peoples. It is as the homes of people made familiar through story 
and picture, however, that these lands must be regarded. 
Children of eight years, while probably ready enough to reply 
“Tt is round,” if asked the shape of the earth, are not likely to 
have a true conception of it asa globe. To them it appears flat, 
with risings and hollows; and it is as a flat earth, we may be 
sure, that it exists in their minds. At this stage, however, they 
must learn to think of it as a globe; and they will not be able 
to change their ideas of it without help. Some treatment of 
the matter, therefore, is necessary and suggestions are given 
below : 
Introduction of the Globe-—We should not, for the moment, 
attempt to prove to the children the fact of its roundness, but 
simply put the globe—one in relief will be infinitely more valuable 
—hbefore them and tell them that it is to stand to them for the 
earth, which is the same shape but immensely larger. Should one 
of them object that the earth looks flat, it will be enough to say : 
“ Well, let us suppose that there were some very tiny creatures— 
smaller than the smallest fly—walking on this globe ”—touching it 
— Don’t you think the globe might seem flat to them because they 
could see such a very little of it ata time? But the globe wouldn’t 
be flat for all that, would it ?”’ Then, as occasions arise, in the 
course of the lessons, we may bring in the fact that people have 
been round it. While this is not a proof of its roundness, it will 
help towards their grasping the idea later. From time to time, 
also on school expeditions, we should draw attention to the widen- 
ing view within its circular boundary as some hill is climbed. Draw 
attention, too, to the sun’s path in the sky. Try to get them to 
follow it in imagination, after it has set, round to its rising place 
next morning. These are helps to realisation which will have done
-P-A-G-E-275
262 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
something to prepare the way for the idea before it is necessary to 
begin more formal teaching on the shape of the earth. 
When the globe is first introduced, the poles, equator, con- 
tinents, and oceans should be pointed out, as they will be useful 
in locating places. The names of the land and water divisions 
need not be given unless there is reason to believe that they will 
be helpful to the children. The chief mountain ranges of the world 
and the chief rivers and most famous towns should be located, too. 
The homes of people learned about can then be referred to these, 
and-so knowledge of places on the globe will gradually become 
more definite. 
As at this stage of their mental development the children’s 
memory both for words and appearances is especially strong, 
advantage should be taken of the fact both to teach names of 
such of. the more important features and towns as are known to 
all educated people, and to call attention to characteristic shapes 
of land masses, coast features, position of mountains and direction 
of rivers, Though the significance of these cannot be appreciated 
till later, their storing away in the mind will be found to be of 
advantage before the school course is over. 
In their world-survey the children should not now, as in the 
preparatory stage, be confined to the study of people and their 
homes. Their survey should be more general, and one or two im- 
portant relations should be brought out. Thus the variation in 
temperature at different levels—high, low, medium—and under 
different conditions of heat and cold, moisture and drought, should 
be touched upon. The typical appearance of desert and jungle, 
frozen waste and tropic swamp, should be described and contrasted, 
teaching on the causes of them being reserved for a later stage. 
These contrasts will serve to recall what has been learnt in nature 
lessons of the needs of plants. 
The close connection that exists between vegetation and posi- 
tion can be well seen in the continent of Africa, which falls to be 
studied during this second stage of teaching; and consideration 
should be given to it. Then, though the study of the New World 
comes later, the pupils may be carried on the “‘ magic carpet ” of 
the imagination across the Atlantic to the American continents in 
which, the land stretching further north and south, all the belts 
of vegetation (tropical, sub-tropical, temperate and frigid—from 
Amazonian jungle to frozen wastes that yield only moss and
-P-A-G-E-276

- The Teaching of Geography 263 
lichen) succeed each other between the Equator and the’Arctic and 
Antarctic Seas. 
Such imaginative globe-travelling will enable full advantage to 
be taken of the geographical allusions met with in class and private 
reading. The habit of “ looking up ” these, and the growing power 
to appreciate them, are of the greatest value in filling in the out- 
lines of formal geography lessons and study. 
For South African children the study of the home country 
should mean rather the Union and Rhodesia in outline than any 
one particular province in detail. Geography lessons which are 
given up chiefly to the memorising of names and unrelated facts 
are now discredited ; and the teaching must be on modern regional 
lines: the area under study, that is to say, must be considered in 
its natural regions, determined by surface and climate, and political 
boundaries will be for the moment neglected. They are matters 
of history rather than of geography. 
There are two facts that give special value to the beginning of 
the study of the home country at this time. The pupils have 
reached the limits of possible observational work on their sur- 
roundings ; and, though revisionary lessons should be given from 
time to time, the more imaginative mind-work required in studying 
unseen regions is better suited to their age and powers. Oppor- 
tunities for observation they will still have, for at this age they 
will take longer journeys and visit other places more frequently. 
They are old enough to bring back from these, reliable information 
in regard to distant and widely different parts of the country— 
of the fruit and grain districts of the south-west, and of the 
ostrich, sheep and goat farms of the middle and eastern Cape 
Province; of the Karoo; of the semi-desert Kalahari; of the 
mines of the Rand; of the pastoral Orange Province region and 
of the sub-tropical coast-lands of Natal ; so that places which might 
have been little more than names to them will come to have meaning 
through personal associations. The second fact that gives special 
value to the systematic study of South Africa at this point, is 
that the children are about to begin the formal study of South 
African history, and the two subjects will illuminate each other in 
a way that brings out the close connection existing between them. 
The aim of this first systematic study of the home country 
should ‘be to describe and locate places and to give them living 
associations in the minds of the children. The method ‘of treat-
-P-A-G-E-277
264 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
ment should be something like that which converts a rough sketch 
into a finished picture. First a clear vision of the country in outline 
should be given—of its chief coast features, mountain masses, 
rivers and centres of population. A more vivid description of its 
scenery should follow—of mountain, veld, karoo, semi-desert and 
coast-lands—and these should be clothed in their characteristic 
vegetation and haunted by the animals that have their homes in 
them. After this, the country should be peopled, its inhabitants 
being shown with their characteristics of race (European and native) 
and occupations (farmers, miners, government servants, towns- 
men and country labourers). It should be reviewed, finally, from 
the historic standpoint. In each review the study should be kept 
alive by frequent drawing upon the direct experience and personal 
associations of the pupils. 
After South Africa has been studied in this way, similar, but 
less detailed treatment should be given to the rest of the continent. 
The preliminary glance at it was taken for the purpose of seeing 
South Africa in its proper relation to the great regions of the whole. 
These are now to be studied in more detail, and will be found to be 
capable of subdivision. 
When the home continent has been studied thus, the world 
at large should be taken up systematically in the order decided 
by the syllabus of the school course. 
In the third stage of teaching the aim must be still more clearly 
defined. The question before us as we enter upon it is: “ How 
may the knowledge gathered by my pupils during their previous 
school life be most usefully strengthened, and in what direction 
does it need supplementing ?”’ As, for the majority of elementary 
pupils, school life ends at the close of the Standard VII year, it is 
necessary to review their acquired knowledge with an eye to the 
demands likely to be made upon it in the world they are about to 
enter. What geographical knowledge will be required of them 
when school years are over? Broadly speaking, the knowledge 
which the better class of newspapers assume on the part of their 
readers—such knowledge of the earth, and of life and government 
upon it, as is the common possession of all educated people. 
By the beginning of the last year of school life, the pupils should 
have studied the geography of the whole world in outline, and 
gained more detailed knowledge of the British Empire, with con- 
siderably more of South Africa, and especially of the Union. A 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
The Teaching of Geography 265 
suitable course for the last year then will be the revision of the 
great world-Powers—those of Europe,the United States of America, 
China and Japan—in their relation to the British Empire generally 
and to that part of it in particular of which we are citizens. The 
necessity of following newspaper geography will cause special 
emphasis to be laid on natural resources and their development ; 
on the exchange of products, on communications, with study 
of the great trade routes, past and present, and the reason for their 
growth or decay ; on the causes of the growth and decay of towns ; 
on government and recent history, especially of those interrelations 
which are constantly threatening to disturb the present balance of 
power. 
For revision, at this stage, is not enough. New light must be 
shed, new views given and new interests aroused, while the habit 
of self-reliance must be created in order that, on leaving school, 
the pupils may find it possible to continue their education alone. 
They should be urged, for instance, to follow the march of world 
events as recorded in newspapers and magazines: geographical 
and political changes that in time will become historical ; develop- 
ments in the study of natural history; scientific discoveries that 
affect the health, well-being and prosperity of the world at large, 
and influence exploration and settlement in fever-haunted regions 
of the globe. In addition to this home reading there should be, 
once a week at least, discussion of current events inclass. Emphasis 
should be laid on the advisability of looking up in the atlas such of 
the places mentioned as cannot be instantly located—~at least 
approximately—on a mental map which the sight of the names calls 
up in a flash, especially if their situation affects the matter under 
discussion. Where necessary, attention should be directed to refer- 
ence books from which fuller information on the subject may be 
obtained. In all such discussions any side of the topic likely to 
arouse prejudice should be avoided as much as possible, or, if avoid- 
ance is impossible, should be-dealt with quite impersonally. Our 
aim here must be to place facts before our pupils—not to draw 
conclusions for them. There is a danger, too, that in studying 
newspapers and magazines they will be attracted by the wrong sort 
of thing—by sensational items and matters of small gossip quite 
valueless from an educational standpoint. Much tact and skill 
will be needed to discourage such reading without lessening interest. 
It must be done byshowing the greater interest attaching to matters
-P-A-G-E-279
-266 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
worthy of study, and can be done if we have, in addition to a real 
interest in such matters ourselves, the power to put them in an 
interesting light for our pupils by bringing them into relation with 
their existing interests. As in all efforts to reform, the taste for 
something better must be given before the something worse is 
taken away. 
While a new outlook is thus provided over the field of the world, 
the study of South Africa itself must not be neglected, but be given 
likewise a new turn and a wider and deeper meaning. The stage 
of mind-development reached by the seventh standard year will 
enable the pupils to enter more fully into the matter of the general 
build of the country as influencing occupations, and, through them, 
national development. 
In addition, the matter suggested for study in the case of the 
World Powers as related to the Empire—natural resources, exchange 
of products, communications, growth and decay of trade routes and 
towns—should be studied here in greater detail. 
A return should also be made upon the study of the immediate 
surroundings of the pupils, which, first begun in the preparatory 
stage of teaching, has meanwhile been: enriched by contributions 
from the history and nature lessons which have gone on side by side 
with those in geography. An attempt must now be made to bring 
the matters of separate study—physical features, facts concerning 
the plant and animal life of the region, human activities and histori- 
cal events—into relation with each other. Big national problems, 
as, for example, irrigation schemes, land settlement, prevention of 
soil erosion, treatment of stock diseases, improvement of methods 
of agriculture, railway development, should receive attention. 
The familiarity with the countryside arising from this new study 
of it, should result in greater skill in map-reading ; for it is when the 
pupils are freshest from the study of the natural features that 
surround them that the conventional mapping signs, if understood, 
have the greatest meaning for them. 
On the side of representation, rough sketch maps must illustrate 
the matter of study whenever this is possible. The drawing of 
these is to be regarded as a graphic form of rapid note-making— 
drawing as a means of expression again. Not only greater speed, 
but also greater skill, should mark the map-making at this stage. 
Weather observations and records should be continued, especi- 
ally observations of air-pressure in connection with climate, winds
-P-A-G-E-280
PR 
a 
a “The Teaching of Geography 267 
and rainfall. Inthe study of winds and ocean currents the connec- 
tion between their direction and the daily rotation of the earth must 
be established. 
The importance of outdoor work is very great at this stage. 
The knowledge of mensuration gained in senior standards should 
be applied, during school walks and excursions, to the making of 
contours and of plans of the routes travelled, All such exercises, 
again, have their effect on map reading, which is, perhaps, the final 
goal of elementary geography teaching, for while this, in the words 
of the Transvaal Education Department’s Regulations, “ begins 
with the method of representing familiar places, the classroom, 
the school premises and the neighbourhood by meansofa plan... 
it would be hardly an exaggeration to say it might end where the 
pupil can jpad a\map intelligently.” Certainly we should en- 
courage him to think of a map as a book to be read and studied. 
When they are able through the study of many maps to read 
a new one readily, our pupils should be able to paint in their own 
minds fairly correct views of remote areas. The possession of this 
power will enable them to derive far more pleasure and profit from 
books of travel and exploration. 
Boys in rural and mining districts should gain some direct know- 
ledge of the various soils and typical rocks of the neighbourhood, 
leading up to future study of farming operations or of mine planning 
and levelling. In coast towns they should be instructed in the 
elementary principles of seamanship. In industrial and commercial 
centres they should follow the market reports of some stapleproduct. 
It is very essential, however, that there should be some local or 
personal interest or some definite purpose governing the study of 
these reports, or it will have no more actuality than similar statistics 
drawn from an ordinary text-book. Diagrams on squared paper 
may be used with advantage to illustrate these trade statistics, for 
graphic illustration often carries conviction of facts very difficult 
to establish without it. 
The systematic study of any region must be made according to 
a definite and uniform plan. As in the case of all other lessons, 
an introduction of—or “ preparation”’ for—the subject of it will 
be necessary. The method to be followed in this has often been 
stated. It must seize upon and make use of knowledge previously 
possessed’ by the children, and with this the new matter must be 
brought into relation. In junior standards it will generally be well
-P-A-G-E-281
268 ‘The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
to recall some matters previously studied. For senior scholars 
reference to some passing event may best serve the purpose. In all 
cases emphasis should be laid on some important aspect of the 
subject likely to stir the interest of the pupils. Thus Switzerland 
may be approached by way of its mountain scenery ; America by 
reference to the gigantic scale of occurrences ; China through the 
odd customs of the country; Australia by means of some re- 
semblance to familiar features of the home country, or by reference 
to some of its peculiar animal forms. One thing is linked to 
another in geography as in other studies, and much of the necessary 
teaching may be given simply by following the lead of such natural 
connections. It must never deal with bare names, but must show 
the meaning and origin of them, refer them to history, to literature, 
to recent occurrences and to personal experiences. 
Then before a region is left it must be systematically reviewed 
according to a prepared plan which follows some reasoned order, as, 
for instance, position, size and shape, with such inferences as may 
be made regarding elevation and climate ; build and surface; pre- 
vailing winds and ocean currents ; rainfall, soil, minerals, vegetation, 
animallife ; and, lastly, human inhabitants—their race, appearance, 
distribution, occupations and government. . 
Some such course as is outlined above is suited to the needs of 
pupils in elementary schools, giving to those who leave after passing 
Standard VII necessary familiarity with geographical facts and 
geographical ideas, and laying a firm foundation for the more ad- 
vanced work of the high schools in the case of those who continue 
their schooling beyond the elementary stage.

CHAPTER XII 
THE TEACHING OF ARITHMETIC 
“ Arithmetic is a science . . . andan art. . . . Studied as a science it is an 
admirable training in abstraction, judgment and reasoning. Practised as an 
art it enters into the daily life of nearly every civilised being, from the boy 
who sells matches in the street to the minister who controls the finances of a 
nation.” —Salmon. 
“ Arithmetic in the primary school should be regarded as consisting, not of 
so many isolated rules, but simply of a few fundamental operations which may 
be applied in a great variety of circumstances.”—-Scottish Memorandum on 
“ The Teaching of Arithmetic.” 
In spite of the fact that more time is spent on arithmetic in our 
schools than on any other subject, the results obtained are very 
far from satisfactory, whether we regard them from the point 
of view of practical usefulness or from that of mental training. 
‘There are a number of causes, including badand insufficient teaching, 
to which this unsatisfactory state of things is due, but perhaps the 
chief is that both these aims are often lost sight of in the endeavour 
to keep pupils occupied in the working of exercises, and in preparing 
them for a prescribed examination-test. These endeavours have 
led to the neglect of principles of teaching which must be observed 
if real success is to follow. It will be well to summarise these prin- 
ciples here, in order that they may be borne in mind from the 
beginning. 
The first necessity in teaching any subject is to interest our 
pupils in it. If we feel that this interest is lacking we must try 
to make the subject real to them—to show them, that is, that it 
has something to do with their lives as they live them from day 
to day. In arithmetic this may be done by basing examples on 
matters within our pupils’ experience ; by stating these, as‘a rule, 
in concrete terms, by having early examples worked out by’ means 270
-P-A-G-E-284
ue The Teaching of Arithmetic 271 
of concrete objects and by giving practical exercises whenever 
possible. How very unreal their operations in arithmetic often are 
to children is proved by the absurdity of some of the answers they 
find for us. This feeling of unreality is sometimes strengthened, if 
not actually caused, by the absurdity of the conditions given in 
examples. A standard arithmetic contains the followiig example 
in proportion: If a man can plough 1280 acres in 8 dpys with 12 
horses, how many will he plough with 10 horses? ‘he children, 
who have no experience of winged horses, may well bé excused for 
thinking that such arithmetic has nothing to do with their every- 
day life. 
Having attended to these conditions we must see that we really 
teach arithmetic and do not merely éest our pupils by means of 
examples. To state a rule, to apply it to one or more blackboard 
examples, and then to set the children to work an indefinite 
number of exercises on it, is not to teach arithmetic in any real 
sense. Under such conditions their work is sure to be of a more 
or less mechanical nature, of little use for practical purposes except 
in a few cases of straightforward reckoning, and of no value as 
mind-training. 
The concrete side of arithmetic teaching is of such importance 
both in the early stages, when the children are too young for much 
abstract calculation, and throughout the school course for the 
purpose of explaining new rules more clearly, that more attention 
should be paid to it than is usually the case. In the early stages 
of number teaching the actual counting and placing of objects 
should first precede and then accompany abstract figure working. 
Later, working by means of concrete objects will be found to aid 
in the full understanding of new rules. It must be remembered, 
however, that arithmetic is meant to be abstract in the latest stages 
of all rules, since it is in abstract reckoning only that the necessary 
speed can be obtained. In using the concrete, speed is, of course, , 
sacrificed ; but it is sacrificed deliberately in the interests of under- 
standing. A number of exercises which will be found useful in 
the different stages of teaching are suggested below, being 
grouped here for convenience of reference. They are taken 
chiefly from articles on Correlated Nature Study in The Cape 
Education Gazette and from Longmans’ Practical Arithmetics, by 
permission, 
1. For notation from 1 to 9. Simple addition and subtraction.
-P-A-G-E-285
272 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
Exercises with concrete objects (such as counters or kindergarten 
sticks) as units ; drawing exercises to illustrate the same number 
facts. 
On squared paper (ruled in 1-inch squares) let the children 
“\ine in” an oblong containing 3 squares. Adjoming this, let 
them also line in an oblong containing 2 squares. Bid them count 
the number of squares in each part, and in the whole oblong, and 
then write down: 3 squares-+-2 squares==5 squares, (Similarly 
2 squares +3 squares; 1 square+4 squares, and 4 squares +1 
square.) 
For another exercise, let them “ line in” an oblong of 5 squares, 
then shade 2 squares showing § squares— 2 squares=3 squares, 
(Similarly 5 squares — 1 square—4 squares, etc.*) 
2. For composition of the number 10. Exercises with counters, 
ten-slips (strips of paper ruled in ten equal squares), two-slips, 
five-slips ; cardboard coins, rulers and pencils. 
3. For notation from 11 to 50. Addition and Subtraction, Exer- 
cises with counters, kindergarten sticks, slips, etc. Separating the 
“ten-group” from the remaining units; drawing exercises, 
Being provided with the paper ruled in 100 squares, the children 
should line in, or shade, squares as required to represent the various 
numbers, writing down the necessary statements in each case, e.g., 
1 ten-group + 6 units=16 units. 
I ten-group -+ 3 units=13 units.* 
4. For notation from 51 to roo. Addition and Subtraction. 
Exercises with kindergarten sticks and elastic bands (for the 
making of bundles), counters and slips. 
5. For Multiplication and Division. Exercises for illustrating 
certain numbers, ¢.g. 12, by means of inches and pence; drawing 
exercises and others with cardboard coins ; 16 by means of balance 
and actual weighing exercises (sand is a suitable substance for 
these) to be done by chosen children, not by the teacher; 3, 6, 9, 
and 12 by means of foot-rule and yard-stick. 
6. For elementary notions of Fractions. Exercises with paper 
squares and oblongs of squared paper ; paper folding and paper 
cutting; drawing exercises ; dividing and shading of lines and 
squares ; use of coinage and measures ; shop games. 
(1) For Multiplication Tables (Standard II).—Exercises in con-
-P-A-G-E-286
The Teaching of Arithmetic 273 
nection with extension of number square to 12 x12. The number 
12, of special importance as entering into money table and long 
measure, demands several lessons, and many practical exercises 
during them. A foot-rule and 12-slip, and pence and shillings in 
cardboard coins should be used to aid the demonstration. 
(2) For Multiplication and Division of Money, Weights and 
Measures.—Work of a concrete nature should here be given to illus- 
trate these rules, children being called from the class to perform 
actual operations, cardboard coins being used in money sums, lines 
drawn on the blackboard for the measures of length, and actual 
vessels of varying content for that of capacity. Conversion—at 
this early stage from one denomination to the next only—may be 
informally introduced by means of varied exercises with the same 
apparatus, 
(3)For Tables of Weightsand Measures (Standard ITI).—(a)Exer- 
cisesin connection withavoirdupois. Examples of objects or quantities 
weighing an ounce and a pound to be shown and handled, of others 
weighing a cwt. and a ton to be cited. The children to be familiar- 
ised with these, and the standard of weight to be frequently applied 
in connection with arithmetical examples. (6.) The inch and foot 
lengths should be accurately drawn by the children in their books, 
and a yard strip folded within them or drawn on blackboard. The 
pupils should, thereafter, be exercised in estimating lengths and 
surface areas of books, slates, desks, etc., rough and ready standards 
being shown to be available in hand, thumb, span, arm, and foot. 
The mile should be known as a certain distance from school on the 
main road, and should be measured by each Standard IIT class 
once in the school year. Exercises in connection with this unit 
should be given, the children being told to find how long it takes 
them to walk and to run the distance. (c) The measures of capacity 
should be dealt with in a similar practical manner, actual measuring 
vessels, as far as possible, being taken to class for purposes of experi- 
ment. The capacity of a paraffin tin having been found experi- 
mentally, the pupils should be required to find by its means the 
capacity of larger vessels, etc., at home. (d) A simple object-lesson 
on the unit of time, using in demonstration a small lead ball fixed 
to a fine thread about 39 inches long. This, allowed to swing 
freely, will beat seconds. Exercises in connection with the unit of 
time should then be given, the clock—or a clock- -face—being used 
in illustration. The children may be directed to notice their heart 
s
-P-A-G-E-287
274 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
or pulse beats in order to accustom them to the duration of a 
second. (¢) The class should be given a rough idea of plots of 
ground, an acre and a morgen in area respectively. A simple 
object-lesson on the chain or tape should be given, and if a chain 
is procurable the boys in the class should do some actual measur- 
ing with it! (f) The cubic inch, foot, and yard, as introducing 
the idea of a new dimension, must be carefully explained. By means 
of a large bar of soap cut into cubic inches, the cubic table can be 
taught experimentally. Large cubes should be employed to teach 
the relation between the cubic foot and cubic yard. The dimensions 
of the cubic inch, foot, and yard should then be marked in a corner 
of the room, floor and walls being used for the purpose. Simple 
practical exercises in finding the cubic capacity of small boxes (in 
inches) and of rooms (in feet) should be set. 
In connection with these exercises the children should be taught 
the names and capacities of measures used locally—of the muid in 
grain districts and the hogshead where the vine is grown. The 
pupils should also be encouraged to find by what measures commo- 
dities of every-day use are sold, and their price per measure at the 
local store or market. Thus arithmetic will begin to appeal to them 
as a thing that concerns their every-day life. 
(4) For Vulgar Fractions (Standard IV).—(a) Further exercises 
in connection with the teaching of addition and subtraction, Ap- 
pavatus : paper squares, rulers graduated in inches, halves, quarters, 
and eighths, drawing paper and materials, imitation coins, weights, 
and measures. These should be used to show the relation of the 
fractions mentioned to whole lines, squares, and other figures and 
coins. The paper squares may be employed to work out actual 
addition and subtraction examples. (6) Exercises in connection 
with measures and multipliers. Apparatus: cardboard strips and 
counters; wooden splints and other small objects; plain and 
squared drawing-paper and materials. © Slips, lines, and rectangular

The value of ora! exercises in making clear underlying principles, 
as well as in developing ease and speed in calculating, has not been 
sufficiently recognised in the past. Such exercises train the pupils 
to work with increasingly large numbers without resorting to the 
use of figures. At the same time, long operations should not be 
given in the form of oral exercises, since it is in the solving of the 
problem, and not in the manipulating of its numbers, that the 
value of them chiefly lies. 
Here, perhaps, is the place to remark on that strange tendency, 
noticeable on the part of some students and teachers, to speak of 
“ mental” and “ written ” arithmetic as if they were two separate 
subjects. All arithmetic, of course, is worked mentally, and what is 
called written arithmetic differs only in the fact that the answer is 
reached by means of a certain amount of figuring. We should 
make the transition from one form to the other naturally by sub- 
stituting for the small numbers in a given problem, such larger 
ones as make impossible the task of remembering all the figures 
that the required reckoning gives rise to. This would show our 
pupils the true relation between the two and lead to their’ 
using both intelligently. They would realise that “ Mental arith- 
metic is not a different kind of arithmetic to be wrought by special 
shorthand methods. Every short method taught for mental use 
should also be used in paper-work, for the short method is always 
the correct one to use in any calculation ” (J. Gunn, Class Teaching 
and Management, p. 120). 
But although, as has been stated, oral exercises are to be 
given for the purpose of securing a clearer understanding of prin- 
ciples, they are not to be used solely with this aim. They have
-P-A-G-E-289
276 The School; the Child, and the Teacher 
besides to fulfil the purpose of developing ease and speed in calcula- 
tion. Exercises should be set with the aim of making the pupils 
ready reckoners in all practical calculations. Rapidity in working 
may be secured by the adoption of methods and setting of exercises 
specially designed with this end in view. Among methods the 
following are recommended : 
The naming of totals only in addition—e.g., in adding 9, 7, 5, 3, 
pupils must not say 9 and 7 are 16; 16 and § are 21; 21 and 3 
are 24; but simply 9, 16, 21, 24. 
Working by the “ complementary ” method in subtraction. Its 
working may be seen in the following example, o5a-er4 3 4andS 
are 12; 7 and 7 are14; 6and 2are 8. Answer 278. 
The adoption of shoriened methods in multiplication—e.g., by 10, 
by adding o to the multiplicand ; by 5 (based on the preceding 
method), by adding o to the multiplicand and dividing it by 2 (since 
5=10+2). 
Of worse, the principles underlying these shortened methods 
must be taught, and taught inductively. With regard, for ex- 
ample, to the multiplying by 5, the following statements should 
be obtained from the children : 
When we add o to the multiplicand we multiply it by 10. 
But io=twice 5. 
. We must divide the result by 2, which will give half 10 
times = 5 times. 
The use of the tests of divisibility in division.—As a knowledge of 
these will be useful, the children should learn them one by one in 
connection with the different numbers. The various tests must 
not. simply be set as rules to be memorised during the course of a 
single lesson. 
As useful exercises the following are suggested : 
Speed testing by tables of various kinds specially built to enable 
the teacher by simply pointing, after initial instructions, from one 
number or quantity to another, to indicate to the pupils what is 
required in answer. This results in the securing of the greatest 
possible number of answers in a.given time. Such exercise is very 
valuable in the lower standards. . 
Starting with a given number and requiring cach pupil to add 
another to it progressively Starting with 3 and adding 7 we get, 
for example, the successive totals 10, 17, 24, 31, etc. 
Combining the four simple rules in a single example—as, for
-P-A-G-E-290
ll ~The Teaching of Arithmetic 277 
instance,-2 and.5 and o and 3 ; double the answer; take away 2; 
divide by 3; add 4; multiply by 2. Call the answer farthings— 
how many pence ? 
Decimalising of money instantaneously,—e.g., of £1, 108.=+5 3 
5S. +25 528. 6d. +125; 28.=-+1; I8.=-05, etc. | 
While oral exercises are especially useful in the lower standards, 
where, as the children are not quick at figure-making, written ex- 
amples would waste much time, they should be given constantly 
and regularly throughout the school course. In the sub-standards 
and Standard I, not less than two-thirds of the whole time given 
to arithmetic should be spent on them; in Standards II, III and 
IV,a half ; and a very considerable portion in the upper standards. 
Of course, in single-teacher schools it will not be possible to give ” 
so much time to them; but even in these it will be found that 
by careful grouping much may be accomplished. 
While every possible endeavour should be made—both by means 
of concrete working and by furnishing suitable oral exercises—to 
make the rulesand principles of arithmetic intelligible to the children 
at the outset, it must be borne in mind that it is not possible for 
them to get a firm mental grasp of every rule during early lessons. 
Here, as elsewhere, they must learn by doing, and the doing in this 
case consists in the working out of a sufficient number of suitable 
exercises. During the working of these there should, however, be 
a constant turning back to the principles involved in order that 
the pupils may come to a clearer understanding of them. 
We may frequently notice during oral exercises that a child 
who can readily furnish an answer to a given test question is at a 
loss if asked to tell how he obtained it. This is because it is a 
difficult task for untrained minds to analyse the processes by which 
a conclusion is reached. Intelligent teaching of the rules, and the 
practice of inviting the children to trace the steps by which they 
work out their mental exercises, is necessary in such cases. We 
sometimes find, too, that children who seem to have mastered a 
tule quickly have not grasped the underlying principle. This is 
proved when, faced with the necessity of applying the same rule 
to new examples, they fail to take advantage of opportunities for 
shortening which the new rule provides. From the beginning 
children should be trained to keep a look-out for possible methods 
of shortening and to treat all examples by commonsense methods. 
Before considering in turn the various rules of arithmetic, the
-P-A-G-E-291
278 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
necessary preparation for learning them and the subsequent appli- 
cations to be made, it will be well to consider the stages into which 
arithmetic teaching in elementary schools is usually divided. There 
are three, corresponding to the work of the sub-, lower and 
upper standards respectively. The first is a preparatory stage 
in which the pupils must learn to understand the principle of the 
decimal system of notation ; to master the names and order of 
sufficient of the numbers to exemplify it; and to recognise and 
write the symbols representing these numbers. The second is 
a middle stage in which the work treats mainly of whole numbers. 
Our endeavour in this stage should be, not to enable our pupils 
to work long or involved exercises or manipulate large numbers, 
but to deal readily and quickly with small ones. Examples 
should be stated in concrete terms, and should deal with actual 
instances of buying and selling, of making bills and such other 
arithmetical processes as enter into the practical business of life. 
The operations should be within the children’s power of realisation 
at all times, and they should not only know what to do, but 
why it is to be done. Every principle should be illustrated by 
means of small numbers, and rules should be formed by the children 
themselves as the result of direct observation. 
Problems should be given very early, since they are best suited 
to train children in habits of intelligent working. When the first 
two rules have been mastered (as far as small numbers are con- 
cerned) with the aid of concrete illustration, they should be com- 
bined in little problems. From this time every rule, besides being 
preceded by oral exercises, should be followed by written problems. 
: The third is a completing stage. In it the effort must be made 
to round off the pupils’ knowledge before the school-leaving age 
is reached. In the first place, by means of exercises suited to their 
age, revision of all rules and principles mastered must be constant, 
its aim being to develop further speed and accuracy in reckoning. 
Readiness in making approximate calculations, and in applying 
short methods, must be a special feature of the practice given during 
this stage. Secondly, the teaching on certain rules must be carried 
further, and more difficult applications of them required as in the 
treatment of the units of length, area and volume for advanced 
work in mensuration, of vulgar and decimal fractions, and of pro- 
portion. Thirdly, there must be application of the rules to new 
work, as in the case of the notation of the metric system, averages, 
percentages, simple and compound interest and stocks ; profit and
-P-A-G-E-292

loss, and discount in relation to business partnerships and’ profit- 
sharing ; squares and square roots, 
We may now trace the development of this work through the 
school course. 
It begins in the sub-standards, where, as a necessary preliminary, 
the children must learn in order the names of the numbers with 
which they will have to deal ; and it will be well if, from the begin- 
ning, they learn to associate these names with the figures used to 
represent the numbers. The teaching of the name of a number 
should therefore be accompanied by the presenting of the form 
which stands for it, and the forms taught during any lesson should 
be copied by the children. During this stage it will be found helpful 
to associate small numbers with their arrangement on cards and 
dominoes, as these not only give a graphic representation of the 
number, but show of what smaller ones they are made up. 
The earliest number exercise is the actual counting of objects, 
as opposed to adding, which should, however, begin very soon. 
Numbers at first must be associated with actual objects, as when 
the children, having the ball-frame in front of them, say 2 balls 
and 2 balls are 4 balls, placing the two 2’s together to make the 4 as they 
speak. Then in the interests of speed it must be associated with the 
idea of the balls only, as the children say again, but without touching 
them or seeing them, 2 balls and 2 balls are 4 balls. This is the inter- 
mediate step between concrete counting and abstract adding, as in 
saying 2 and 2 are 4. In this last case the number is presented by 
itself. Objects and the idea of them called up by their name have 
both been stripped away, leaving only the abstractform of statement. 
In connection with the matter of concrete counting, we must 
decide what are the best objects to be used for it. On this point 
authorities differ, for while some would rule out the use of fingers 
in favour of objects that can be removed at discretion, others advo- 
cate their use as, literally, ‘‘ the handiest of all.” While the fact 
that the systems of number in common use originated in 4 counting 
of the fingers seems an argument in favour of allowing it in the very 
early stages, there is a drawback to the practice that makes it better 
on the whole not to do so. Their very handiness tempts the pupils 
to continue using them longer than they should do, so that they 
fail to advance at the proper time from concrete counting, which is 
necessarily slow, to the quicker addition without the aid of objects. 
Whatever objects are used for the purpose should not be either 
too attractive in themselves (as, for example, sweets, nuts and
-P-A-G-E-293
280 ‘The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
fruits), or such as crumble, or otherwise perish, quickly ;' or such-as 
make the children desire to possess them. They should be easily 
procurable in sufficient numbers. Sticks, laths or cubes of wood, 
large beans and buttons, are perhaps as suitable as any. 
The number lesson should be a language lesson also, the children 
being trained to express clearly in words what they have done in 
any arithmetical operation. It is very necessary in this as in every 
other part of their work that the children should be accustomed 
to giving complete answers, plainly spoken, with clear articulation 
and purity of vowel sound. 
While all authorities are agreed that children must be taught 
to count by use of concrete objects, they differ as to the method 
to be employed in teaching. The particular method, however, 
matters much less than the recognition of the principle that mental 
calculation must be approached through actual operations with 
concrete objects, and we are likely to do the best work with a method 
evolved in its details by ourselves once we are familiar with the 
central ideas which should govern it. These are given below. 
Early lessons should deal with numbers under zo, and in learning 
to count up to g the children should learn the composition of these 
numbers through arranging their objects in different ways—thus 
8 as eight 1’s, four 2’s, two 3’s-++2, and two 4’s. They should be 
taught to count not by 1’s alone, but by 2’s, 3’s, 4’s and 5's, for 
the children who learn to count by 1’s only, are likely, later, to add 
separate 1’s and, given 7 + 3 to Solve, to reckon 7, 8, 9, zo instead 
of obtaining the answer ro in one operation. They must be taught 
to count backward (later subtraction) by 1’s, 2’s, 3’s and 4’s from 
ro to 1, as well as forward (later addition) from x to ro. In the 
figure teaching that must accompany the object counting, we should 
first show the value in the concrete and then the symbol, requiring 
the children both to place the object and to make the figure, for 
“the work of teaching a number is not complete until the child has 
been taught to make neatly and with despatch the figure which 
stands for the number.”

Note.—Even while the children are still at the stage of printing 
letter forms, they should be trained in the habit of making clear 
statements by words aiding figures.
-P-A-G-E-295
282 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
As soon as these examples are perfectly understood and readily 
worked, it is time to deal with the number 10 and those beyond it 
within the limits of lower class work. At this point the first prin- 
ciples of place value will need careful teaching and illustration. 
The children have already begun notation in learning to make signs 
to stand for numbers—the figures or digits from 1tog—and in stating 
the smallsums in addition and subtraction employing these numbers. 
This acquaintance must now be extended, and in passing from 9 to 
1o the children need to learn that the value of a figure depends 
upon its position with regard to other figures, and that, in any one 
number, the figure on the left has ten times the value of the figure 
on the right. This can be made clear by the use, for example, of 
kindergarten sticks or matches with the heads cut or washed off 
—single ones and others tied in bundles of r1o—and may be taught 
in the following manner : 
Provide a small sloping table and divide its surface by chalk 
lines thus : Ones or 
Tens, Units.

ep The Teaching of Arithmetic 283 
Over the right-hand column, in each case, print Ones or Units 
as a heading. Show that the divisions of the table and the B.B. 
correspond. 
Hold up x stick. Get children to tell that it is a single stick or 
one stick. Put it on the table in the right-hand place. Ask children 
what figure must be put for it on the B.B., and impress that it also 
must go in the right-hand column which is the place for ones or units. 
Similarly show 2, 3 or 4 sticks, Obtain the answer that they 
also must go into the right-hand place. Put them under the one 
stick on the table and enter the figure to represent them under the 1 
on the B.B. 
Show also 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9 sticks, and proceed as before, finally 
entering the figure to represent them under the last unit figure 
above. Print U over the right-hand place first on the table and 
then on the B.B., and point out that, as the first letter of Units, it 
may be made to stand for the word. 
Show ro sticks. Ask how the number must be written on the 
B.B. (The children having learnt figures to 9 only will be puzzled.) 
Make the ro sticks into a bundle and show that the ten single ones 
have become one bundle of ten sticks, which may therefore be called 
one fen, Emphasize that it cannot go into the Units place because 
it is no longer ten single ones, but a bundle. Being different from 
the others it must have a place of its own. Put it in the left-hand 
column on the table and tell that that is the place for bundles of ten 
ortens. Ask a child to show its place on B.B. Impress that though 
it is not x single stick it is 1 bundle. Figure 1 is therefore put for it, 
but is put in the new place to the left, not among the Units. Print 
T for Tens over the left-hand place on the table and B.B., and im- 
press that the name is given because there are ro single ones in 
the bundle. Ask how many units there are on the table level with 
the x ten. [None.] Make o on the B.B. level with the 1 ten and 
in the Units place. Impress that these two figures together, 1 on 
the left (in the Tens place) and o on the right (in the Units place) 
stand for the number ten which is made up of ten ones. 
Note.—The lesson should end at this point. Before the next 
notation lesson. the children should have practice first in. writing 
the symbol 10, then in counting to xo, and finally in writing all the 
figures to 10 by way of impressing that xo follows 9 as 9 follows 8. 
The number ro is so important in our decinial system of nota-
-P-A-G-E-297
284 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
tion that other lessons on it should be given before passing to the 
notation of higher numbers. It is generally recognised that rapid 
and accurate addition of a column of numbers is best secured through 
adding by tens. If, for example, children have to add 7 to 5, they 
should be taught to add first the 5 required to make 10 and then 
the-2 remaining which is the difference between that 5 and the 
7 given. The sum of 547, they must see, is 2 more than 10, 
te, 12. 
But if they are to use this method readily they must previously 
have had much practice in decomposing the number 10 and in 
deciding what number must be added to a given number to make 
it. Lessons must therefore be given on ro and its parts, practice 
in the addition and subtraction of these parts being provided for 
during their course. During these lessons, by the use of concrete 
illustrations and drawing the following number-facts should be 
brought out : 
Io=9g+1 ori+9 g=I0-1 
Io =8+2 or 2+8 I=10—9 
I0=7+3 OF 347 8=10--2 
Io=64+4 or 4+6 2=10-—8 
10 =5+5   
Frequent drill in the use of these facts should be given, and 
then exercises like the following : 
Mary is five years old. In how many years will she be ten 
years old ? 
Tom had tod. one day, and spent tod. the next. What had he left? 
How many days are there in a week and three days ? 
The factors of 10, for the purpose of making our pupils still 
more familiar with the number, should now be introduced. The 
first step will be to show them by means of the “ ten-slip” that 
to=10x1. Suggestions for treatment follow : 
Apparatus : Counters ; ten-slips, which can be made by cutting 
strips ro squares long and 1 square deep from a squared exercise 
book ; squared papers ruled in } inch squares ; rulers and pencils. 
Give the children each a number of small counters to serve as 
units. Let them take from these one at a time and put it on the 
desk in front of them, counting the while from 1 to xo. Give them 
one ten-slip each and bid them take each of the ten units they

A The Teaching of Arithmetic 285 
have just counted out and put it upon one of the squares of the 
ten-slip, counting aloud as before. Ask: “ How many ones did 
you count?” “How many ten-slips?” Write: 
ro ones=r ten-slip 
Take a pair of scissors and from your own larger ten-slip*cut 
the squares one by one, the children watching and counting aloud. 
Write : 
1 ten-slip= ro ones. 
Bid the children line in an oblong ro long and x deep. Bid 
them line in the separate squares more thickly. Ask: ‘“ How 
many times have you drawn a square?” ‘‘ How many squares 
in the oblong?” ‘ How many times larger than one square is 
the oblong?” Write : 
to times 1 square= Io squares. 
Bid them look again at their oblongs. Ask: ‘ Into how many 
parts have you divided it?” ‘‘ How many squares in each part ? ” 
Write : 
Io squares > lo= I square. 
Repeat the exercises several times. 
The next step will be to teach the factors of 10 (5x2). 
Suggestions follow : 
Apparatus: Smali counters; two-slips, five-slips, ten-slips ; 
imitation coins ; measures ; squared paper ; rulers and pencils.

find that: 2 counters++2 counters-+2 counters-+2 counters+2

3. By cutting off 2-square pieces from the ten-ship and having 
the number of pieces and the number of squares in each piece 
counted, show that : 
10 squares — 5 = 2 squares. 
By cutting off 5-square pieces and having them counted in the 
same way, show that : 
Io squares > 2=5 squares. 
4. By sharing 10 pennies among 5 children show that : 
zo pennies + 52 pennies,

ro pennies + 2=5 pennies. 
5. By arranging zo children in 2 rows and then in 5 rows 
show that : ‘ 
ro children + 5=2 children. 
to children +2=5 children.? 
Subsequently the symbols from ro-r1g should be practised from 
copy and from dictation, questions being asked from time to time 
to ensure that the children understand the value (1) of each number 
represented, (2) of each figure in the number, and (3) their relative 
values. The point that will need emphasizing is that no higher 
number than 9 may go into the units place, because the next 
number above 9 is xo and it must be written as x ten and o units. 
So:

IZ=1I 3=10+3 0r 3+10; I9=1 9=10/ 9 0rg+I0 
When all the numbers from 10 to 19 have been introduced, 
and dealt with in the concrete, rapid practice in decomposing them 
should be given. The meaning of the suffix teen must be made 
clear. Exercises in numeration (writing of number in words) 
should accompany the exercises in notation (writing of number 
in figures), the words, to begin with, being printed on the blackboard 
opposite the figures and the children helped to read them. 
1 Adapted from Lesson 5, Longmans’ Practical Arithmetics, Bk, 1 (Teachers’),
-P-A-G-E-300
The Teaching of Arithmetic 287 
As soon as our pupils know the names, order and value of 
numbers from 1-19, they should be taught to count by tens, first 
using the ball frame and bundles of sticks in doing so, and then 
proceeding by way of the intermediate step with names to the 
abstract with use of the symbols only. The filling in of units 
between one 1o and another will present no difficulty, as the 
names, order and value of these are all known. Backward counting, 
it must be remembered, is to be practised both from 19-1 by ones 
and from 100-10 by tens. Practice should also be given in count- 
ing forward and backward by tens, starting from any number, 
thus: 11, 21, 31, 41, etc., to gr and 95, 85, 75, etc., to 5. 
Questions should be put to ensure that the counting is not merely 
mechanical, but that the children realise the difference in value 
resulting from the change of name, viz.: “Is 30 more or less than 
20?” “How many more?” etc. 
The introduction of the multiples of ro in counting carries 
forward our teaching on the decimal system of notation. This is 
of such importance that every effort must be made to get the 
children to understand it. Concrete illustration must be freely 
employed—counters, cardboard, or paper slips and matches, or 
kindergarten sticks made up in bundles of tens and fastened by 
means of small elastic bands or some easy form of tie-string. 
Suggestions for treatment (based on Lesson 7, Longmans’ Practical 
Arithmetics, Book U1, Teachers’) follow : 
Apparatus: Small counters; ten-slips; squared paper ruled 
in inch squares ; rulers and pencils. 
Bid the children take counters from their heap one by one till 
they have taken 9, counting each one as they place them in a row 
before them. Bid them place the ten-slip below the row of counters 
and write the digits 1 to 9, one in each square. Bid them count 
and place the tenth counter and write the symbol for 10 in the 
tenth square of the slip. 
Tell them to compare the symbol for ro with the other 9 sym- 
bols. It consists of two figures, the rest of one only. Lead them 
to see, by comparison of the counters and slips, that : 
To ones=1 ten-group. 
By another reference to the symbols lead them to see that while 
1 stands for x unit, 
zo stands for x ten-group and o units.
-P-A-G-E-301
288 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
*» -Get them to tell that the o shows that there are no units, and 
that the x does not stand for a single one but for 1 ten-greup, which 
is ten times as great as 1 unit. 
Bid them place a second ten-slip under the first in the squares 
of which they wrote the symbols 1 to ro. 
Point out that they now have 2 ten-groups and lead them to 
see that : 
1 ten-group +1 ten-group—2 ten-groups, 
and 1 ten-group x 2 =2 ten-groups. 
Have the separate squares counted and get the children to tell 
that 
ro units + 10 units=2zo units, 
and that | 
, Io units X 2 = 20 units. 
Lead them then to see that 
2 ten-groups = 20 units. 
Have the symbol 20 examined and show that it stands for 
2 ten-groups and o units. 
Take away one ten-group. Ask what is left. Get the 
answers; 2 ten-groups—1 ten-group—1 ten-group. 
20 units —1o units ==10 units, 
. By means of a third ten-slip help the children to discover and 
to state that : 
2 ten-groups +1 ten-group= 3 ten-groups. 
and that: 
1 ten-group x 3 == 3 ten-groups. 
Lead them to see further that : 
20 units+ ro units = 30 units. 
ro units X 3 = 30 units. 
3 ten-groups == 30 units, 
3 ten-groups — 1 ten-group== 2 ten-groups. 
30 units — ro units = 20 units. 
Bid the children examine the symbol 30. Get them to tell 
that it stands for 3 ten-groups and no units. 
Deal similarly with the other multiples of ro from 4o to go.

The Teaching of Arithmetic 289 
Have certain of the exercises revised by means of drawing 
exercises, the children being required to line in the required number 
of ten-groups. 
Give simple exercises stated in concrete form, e.g. : 
There are three. money-boxes each having 10 shillings, How 
many shillings in all? (Written answer : 10 shillings x 3= 30 shillings. 
A man had 50 sheep and sold 30 of them. How many left ? 
If I have 70 marbles, to how many children can I give 10 marbles 
each ? 
Before the end of Standard I our pupils should be ready to 
proceed to the notation of hundreds. The method of teaching tens 
should be employed and developed. It must be pointed out that 
the process of turning tens into hundreds is similar to that of turning 
ones into tens. Before a written example involving the notation 
of hundreds is given oral exercises should revise the earlier process, 
as, for instance: 9, 7, 5, and 4. How many tens? An addition 
sum, the items making roo exactly, may then be written on the 
blackboard. When the new step has to be taken, the added tens 
having been found to total 10 tens, we may proceed as suggested 
below : | foe 
Only 9 tens can go into the tens place. Ask, therefore, what is 
to be done. Aid the children by reminding them of what they did 
when they had more than 9 units (made them into bundles of 10 
units). In the same way, now that they have more than 9 tens, 
they must make them into bundles of ro tens. Call two children 
out.’ Tell one to hold the ro tens together, and: the other to tie a 
piece of string round or slip an elastic band over them. How many 
bundles of 10 tens do the 10 tens make (1bundle exactly). What 
were the ro units called after they were made into a bundle? Show 
the new big bundle of 10 tens. Now a name must be given to this, 
Call a child out and ask him to count the bundles of 10 in it, calling 
them each fen, viz.; 1 ten, 10; 2 tens, 20; 3 tens, 30; and so 
on to g tens, 90; and ro tens, 100. Tell that hundred is the name of 
the new big bundle, because if the ones in it are counted there will 
be found to be 100 ones or 10 tens. Now the hundreds must have 
a place to themselves. Where is it to be? Where is the tens 
place? (Next to the ones on the left.) Get a suggestion for the 
hundreds place, and tell that it is next to the tens on the left, 
just as the tens place is next to the ones on the left. How did we 
mark the units place? (By a U. for units above it.) And the

tens place? (By aT. for tens above it.) How then shall we mark 
our hundreds place. (By an H, for hundreds above it.) Refer 
back to the total of the tens line. What was it? (ro tens.) What 
did we turn our ro tens into? (x hundred.) Are there any other 
hundreds to be added to this 1 hundred? (No.) Then we will 
enter it between the lines. Bid the class read the answer r Hundred, 
o Tens, o Units, or—briefly—-1 Hundred. 
Apparatus in teaching notation will not be required beyond three 
figures ; for when the children are ready to pass beyond 999 they 
will be old enough to apply the principle learnt in connection with 
tens and hundreds to thousands and millions. The three lines of 
these (Hundreds, Tens, and Units) should be taught together, not 
separately, since by this plan ease in reading and writing large num- 
bers is quickly attained. : 
When the notation of thousands and millions has been taught 
it will be found helpful both in the reading and in the writing of 
numbers to set them out thus: 
Millions. Thousands. Ones.

    If, occasionally, twenty such numbers were written on the 
blackboard one under the other and the children exercised in reading 
them—pointing, first, to the number in the left division (369) and 
then to the name (millions) written above ; next to the number in 
the middle division (187) and then to the name (thousands) above ; 
lastly to the number in the right division (503)—ease in reading 
would soon result, and it would soon be possible to susbstitute 
commas for the vertical lines and M. Th. U. above, dispensing finally 
with the letters. Exercises in numeration should follow the exercise 
in notation. Numbers containing cyphers will be found to need 
special attention, as also the writing in proper position one under the 
other of numbers with different notation values, e.g. :

Ff it were impressed that the digits should always be marked 
off in threes from the right by means of commas, many mistakes 
in notation would be avoided. 
Roman numerals to C (100) might be taught with advantage in 
Standards I, II and III. In Standard IV first notions of decimal 
fractions, by extending the principle of place value to figures ‘to 
the right of the units figure, should be given. 
The oral forward counting—or addition—by groups brings 
us into closer relation with multiplication and its “tables,” as 
backward counting—or subtraction- brings us into relation ‘With 
division, the tables for which should receive more attention than 
is customary. They are, of course, only a reversing of the multi- 
plication tables, and when our pupils have learnt, for example, 
that 9x 5 and 5 x 9=45 they should know the number of fives and 
of nines in 45, and be able to give readily the remainder over in 
the case of each number from 45 to 49 or 53. It is customary to 
teach the tables in the order of the number series, but a better way 
is to pick out the easiest first, viz. ro, 5, and 11 times (to 9 x11) ; 
then 2 times with 4 and 8 times (as multiples) following; then 3, 
6, and 9 times. This leaves the end of 11, 12, and 7 times only to 
be learnt. Twelve times may be connected either with 2 and 4 
times or with 3 and 6 times; 7 times, as the hardest, because 7 is 
unrelated to any other number, should be left to the last, and after 
' frequent rebuilding with concrete objects should be memorised 
with especial care and thoroughness, All tables must be built 
by the children themselves before any attempt at memorising them 
is made, ‘The ball frame, perhaps, affords the readiest means of 
concrete table-building, but it can only be used by one child at 
a time. Small detachable objects—e.g. beans—as well as dots, 
strokes, squares, and rings chalked on the blackboard, are, 
therefore, better for the purpose, In these ways each 
table should be perfected before it is left, and, even after that, 
there should be frequent revision by forward and backward 
repetition and cross-questioning, for when the table is put into 
use there must be no hesitating or calculating. The answer to 
the query, self-asked or not, 6 times 8 or 6 into 48 must follow 
like a flash. 
When ‘the compound tables are taught lessons on each should 
be given in-turn, as far as possible with the use of actual specimens
-P-A-G-E-305
292 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
of money, weights and measures. Even in Standard I the children 
during concrete exercises in table-building should be made familiar 
with the coins used in the country and with such simple weights 
(the pound avoirdupois and its parts) and measures (hours and 
minutes ; yards, feet and inches) as they need to know for practical 
purposes. 
Money tables should not be learnt by heart; for « facility in 
dividing by 4, 12, and 20 (which ought to come from a thorough 
knowledge of the Multiplication Tables) is far more useful than 
the recollection of a few money equivalents.” (Salmon: The Art 
of Teaching.) : 
On the use of specimen weights and measures in the teaching 
of the compound tables the same writer justly says : 
“very school should have a set of the smaller weights and 
measures—the pound, ounce, quarter ; the foot, inch, yard; the 
pint, quart, gallon, &c.; and these should be constantly em- 
ployed in teaching the tables. Children will thus see the rela- 
tions -between the different multiples, and acquire some definite 
idea of each. For lack of concrete teaching it is common enough 
to find young people who can repeat their tables correctly, but 
who yet cannot tell whether the playground is a pole or a fur- 
long long, and. whether a scuttle of coal weighs a pound or a 
quarter.” 
In teaching the rules of arithmetic we must not be content 
merely to show our pupils what operations they are to perform 
without giving any reason for them, as that method would make 
no appeal to their intelligence, and could only result in mechanical 
working. As far as is possible we should lead the children to find 
out for themselves both what they are to do and why they are to 
do it. Something may be done in this way even in the sub-standards, 
for children are not entirely ignorant of arithmetic when they come 
to school. They know something of the properties of number 
through actual operations—in counting, grouping, taking away 
and sharing—which they have performed at home in play or in 
earnest. The real difficulties of arithmetic in these classes are 
language and representation. Little children cannot readily tell 
in words what they know of number, and in most cases they know- 
nothing, or almost nothing, of the symbols used to express it. 
Addition differs from counting only in being abstract, while the
-P-A-G-E-306
} The Teaching of Arithmetic 293 
earlier operation is concrete. When we count one, two, three, four, 
five, &c., without reference to concrete objects, we are adding by 
ones. Our pupils do abstract addition in oral exercises at an 
early age as a development of counting which has already been dis- 
cussed. We are here concerned therefore with the difficulties of 
later addition. 
These are met with as soon as a written statement of any 
example worked is required. The first is the difficulty of notation, 
and though early lessons and practice in the writing of number in 
figures should have impressed the principles of place value on our 
pupils before this stage is reached, it may be advisable for a 
time to show. the given numbers and the answer decomposed, as 
follows : 
H. T. U. 
16 Io+ 6 I 6 
39 got 9 3 9 
7 oo+ 7 7 
40 40+ 0 4 ° 
5 oot 5 - 8 107 80+ 27 I ° 7 
  
The time spent in the extra figuring is not time lost, because, 
besides the value of the mechanical practice in figure-making, which 
is very necessary for young children, the fuller statement helps to 
keep the minds of the children on the place value as opposed to the 
face value of the separate symbols. It should, however, be given 
up as soon as we find that our pupils see at a glance without the 
aid of decomposition that, for example, 3 in the second place is 
3 tens or 30.:-Once understanding is reached, speed must be 
the aim, 
A further. difficulty is that of adding by unequal groups instead 
of by equal groups, which, through the practice afforded in counting, 
is easier. It is in preparation for this difficulty that the number 10 
is treated in such detail at an earlier stage.

On this, additions and subtractions can be seen pictorially. 
Taking 8-+4, for example, it is seen that from 8 we have 2 to go 
to get to 10, and when we have taken 2 of our 4 steps there 
are 2 remaining to be taken past the ro, bringing us to 12. 
Again in 16-9, we have 6 steps to go backwards to get to 10, and 
having taken 6 steps out of 9 have still 3 steps to take, bringing us 
to 7. The value of the chart lies in the fact that it enables the 
children to picture the operations, and so saves much memorising. 
The difficulty of carrying in addition is met with as soon as 
the total of the units line passes beyond 9. The principle, of 
course, is of more importance than the term, which might easily, 
and perhaps with advantage, be dropped ; and the principle (of 
adding the tens formed from the units of the answer to those 
occurring in the given sum) must be clearly explained to the pupils 
and firmly grasped by them. If the term is retained, it can be 
illustrated concretely. by actual carrying of the bundles of tens 
made from the units into the tens place, and of the bundles of 
hundreds made from the tens into the hundreds place, children 
being brought from the class to carry them in their hands, and so 
becoming perfectly familiar with the operation and the reason for 
it. But once concrete working gives place to abstract calculation. 
it seems simpler and better to use the word added, as in the follow- 
ing example :

The sum of the units having been given as 21, and the necessary 
process of converting them into 2 tens-++1 having been performed 
ask: “ What is this 1? Where, then, must I place it? And 
what is this 2? Yes, so we must add [not carry] it to the tens 
in our sum. At first, to remind us, we will make a figure 2 under 
them. I can just get in a tiny 2 under the big one without 
taking up toomuchroom. Now letusaddthem.” Treat similarly _ 
the hundreds. The extra figuring, both in the working part and 
under the statement, should be given up as soon as the children 
have grasped the principle underlying the process. Less haste 
is more speed until understanding is reached; but not after- 
wards. . 
Beyond this point all that is needed is practice : 
“ Rapidity and accuracy together, and neither at the expense of 
the other, must be the teacher’s aim. And, in order to get both or 
either, constant care must be given to method, in order to make 
sure that the pupils are really adding, and not counting up by 
units.” (J. Gunn, Class Teaching and Management, p. 89.) 
Terms used in connection with addition (sum, total, plus and 
the sign -+) should be introduced, explained and brought into use 
as soon as possible. 
Both as the most useful (because the most commonly used) of 
arithmetical rules, and also as the one in which the greatest number 
of blunders are made, addition demands great care in teaching 
and much practice, in order that the pupils’ mastery of it may be 
as perfect as possible. 
The second rule to be taught in connection with the written 
work is subtraction. In oral exercises, addition and subtraction 
should keep pace from the first, counting forwards to a given 
number, being immediately followed by counting backwards from 
it. In written work, however, it is better to get a little ahead 
in addition—after the very simple examples given to the Sub- 
Standards—before introducing the difficulties of subtraction.

Bid a child come out and show the larger number in bundles of 
sticks and single sticks, placing them on the table in front of the 
class. Bid another child come out and print over the bundle and 
the 6 single sticks the letters indicating their value (T. U.). “Write 
down the sixteen on blackboard and compare with number on 
table. 
Sticks 10 
16=10+ 6

Ask how many sticks are to be taken away from ro sticks and 
6 sticks. Write the number (9) on blackboard under the 16 and, 
after appeal to the children, decompose both upper and lower to 
show value. Bid a child come out to begin the sum. Ask what 
he is to do first. (Take 9 ones from 6 ones.) Appeal to class. 
Can he do this? What then must he do? 
(The question will puzzle the children if the example is the first 
they have had requiring decomposition.) Point out that the 6 
single sticks are not the only sticks the boy has got. What has 
he besides? (A bundle of ten sticks.) Point out further that 
if the bundle of 10 is untied there will be 10 single sticks as well 
as the 6 single sticks, making 16 in all. Have the operation 
performed concretely, and show it in figures on the blackboard 
as above. Ask how many single sticks, ones or units, the boy has 
now. Bid the class count them, (16). Ask what it was he had to 
do, (Take 9 sticks away.) Point out that he can now do this. 
Bid him do it, and tell how many remain, (7). Show the working 
on the blackboard in figures. Ask if the sum is finished. (Yes, 
because 9 sticks have been taken from 16 sticks.) Ask for the 
answer, and show it on the blackboard. Impress the new teaching, 
namely, that when the number of single sticks (.e. the “ units ” 
or “ones ””) to be taken away is greater than the number of single 
sticks from which they have to be taken, a bundle of ten must 
‘be broken up and the ten single sticks in it added to those in 
the units place. Give further examples, gradually increasing 
difficulty.

168 =100+ 60+ 8- 
. 157 =100+ 50+ 7=157."   |

As in the previous rule all terms and the sign connected with 
this one should be introduced as early as passible. The children 
should be able to use intelligently the terms difference, remainder, 
minus, and the signs “ —” and “‘ =.” For this reason examples 
should be stated as variously as possible—e.g. “ What is the dif- 
| ference between ——?” “Find the remainder when ——.” 
« What is left after —— is taken from-——?” “ What will remain 
  
—?” “Take —— from —~.” “ From —— take a 
Multiplication should be introduced as a shortened form of 
addition. The children have made their first steps towards mas- 
tering the rule, during their carly counting, and later adding, by 
groups. There is, therefore, no reason why concrete exercises 
on it should not be followed, even in Standard I, by the working 
of written examples within the limits of number reached. Care 
should be-taken, that is to say, that examples do not require a 
further knowledge of notation than the children possess, and that 
results can be obtained through the tables they have learnt. It 
will be well in. this standard to give none involving numbers 
/ greater than 99. 
The practice of teaching all the simple rules about the same time, 
| using small numbers, instead of pursuing each independently from

298 ‘The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
units to millions before attacking the next, leads to more intelli- 
gence in dealing with number. It shows arithmetic “ as consisting, 
not of isolated rules,” but of operations closely connected with each 
other—subtraction as a reversing of addition and division of multi- 
plication ; multiplication as a particular variety of addition worked 
in a shortened form, and division bearing the same relation to sub- 
traction. When the rules are seen to be thus intimately related 
to each other, a more intelligent and common-sense use of them 
results. In problem sums, particularly, the benefit of the newer 
practice is seen, and the working of problems is the exercise which, 
before all others in arithmetic, may be made to cultivate intelligence. 
Having granted, then, that it is advisable to give, within the 
prescribed limits, exercises in multiplication and division to be 
worked in Standard I, we must consider how to teach the rules. 
When numbers given to be added are equal, there is a shorter 
way of obtaining the required answer than by adding them one 
after another. We may, instead, find the number of groups 
to be added, and perform the operation in one step by saying 
that so many fimes the given number is equal to whatever the 
sum may be. For example, if we were counting by fives from 
1 to 20, we should say 5, 10, 15, 20. In stating each number we 
have added a 5, and as there are four numbers in the sum, the num- 
ber of 5’s added is four, and the working might be indicated thus : 
5+5+5+5 =20, or thus :—5 [Slnun 
Multiplication, however, enables us to obtain the answer much 
more quickly. Taking the number to be added (5), and the number 
of times it has to be added (4), we say 4 times 5, or write it 5 x 4, 
getting the answer by one operation, for the sum of four 5’s added 
by separate steps, and the product of four times 5 reached in one 
step are the same. In the latter case, instead of actually adding, 
we have made use of our knowledge of the result of previous addi- 
tions committed to memory in the multiplication tables. 
In teaching multiplication, therefore, we should approach the 
rule through addition, working all early examples first by that rule,
-P-A-G-E-312

and then getting the answer more quickly by means of the new one,

Children “take to” the rule readily, because the saving of time 
and labour effected through it is so apparent. 7 eo): 
The fact that the short form can only ‘be ‘used when equal 
numbers are to be added will need emphasizing. 
The terms multiplicand, multiplier, and product, and the sign x 
should be taught in connection with this rule. 
A new difficulty in multiplication occurs whe the multiplier has 
two digits. We have then to obtain two-partial products, and com- 
bine them into the whole product required. The writing down of 
these demands care in teaching, in order that there may be no error 
or confusion in “placing” them, so as to give them their proper 
value. We have also to decide in the case of partial products which 
is to be obtained first? While it is immaterial, as far as the answer 
is concerned, it seems reasonable to obtain first—though this is con- 
trary to what has been the usual practice—that which is first asked 
for: that is,the largest. For example, if we are asked to find 23 times 
637, there is no weighty argument in favour of finding 3 times first, 
and then 20 times, while the practice of obtaining the larger pro- 
duct first will be found useful in stating approximate answers. 
Careful teaching will be needed on the value, shown by placing, 
of the partial products when the multiplier consists of more than 
one digit. In early stages it should be decomposed—e.g. 3703 x 52. 
3703 =the quantity. 
52 
185,150 =50 times the quantity. 
T1406 = 2 yo» » 
192,556 =52 times the quantity. 
    
In later examples the statement of the value of each partial 
product is less necessary, though it is always’ valuable in the interests 
of clearness;

_» When several multipliers higher than 12 have been given, multi- 
plication by factors should be taught. This may be done in connec- 
tion with the exercises in reduction of money, weights, and measures, | 
which form part of the work at this stage. 
(t) By use of imitation coins : 
Example —tI wish to change 6 sixpences into farthings. How 
many should I get for it? 
Method.—Call out one child and give him the amount to be 
changed, in cardboard imitation coins ; call out two others and give 
them the amount, or more, in pennies and farthings respectively. 
Question of the class: How many farthings should be given in 
exchange for each 1d,? ‘for each 6d.? for the 6 sixpences ? State 
on blackboard (a) : 
_1 | (4)\ 6 No. of sixpences,

_ 6 =Value of each in pence.

4=Value of each penny in farthings. 
144 =Value of the six in farthings. 
Let the change be effected by the third child counting out the 
required number of farthings (by fours). 
Next tell the class that instead of changing thesixpences directly 
into farthings, the boy who possesses them will first exchange them 
for pennies, and then for farthings: Question again: How many 
pennies for x sixpence ? for 6 sixpences? State on blackboard (8). 
Compare the two results. . 
Direct attention to the two multipliers in the second statement. 
Multiplied together, they made the single multiplier of the first, or, 
in other words, 4 and 6 (multiplied) are the makers or factors of 24.

From a number of such examples get the children to discover 
the rule that when onenumber is multiplied by the factors of another 
the answer is the same as if it had been multiplied by the second 
number itself. Show children the necessity for the direct method 
in the case of multipliers that cannot be factorised, and the useful- 
ness of multiplying by factors when possible, as saving the line of 
addition of the partial products. 
In the case of exercises involving the multiplication of money, 
weights, and measures by numbers higher than 12 thai are not 
among the products in the multiplication tables, the finding of 
partial products is likely to give trouble. 
Example.—fa5, 18s, 74d. x 217. Here, if the required 200 times 
the amount is found by multiplying it by ro x 20, we shall get (a)

206 times the amount having been found, there remains 17 times 
to be found and added. It is in finding such lower partial products 
that children are apt to go wrong. Here they can be helped by 
insistence ona clear statement of value being written against each 
partial product as above. The practice of making these statements 
should begin with the first blackboard example during early teach- 
ing, when questions should be asked to insure that the children 
know how many times the given amount or quantity they are re- 
quired to find, and how each partial product is to be obtained. 
In order that sufficient practice may be given them, questions - 
on the finding of partial products in a number of examples should 
be asked, instead of two or three examples only being worked 
out fully. : 
The difficulty, however, is avoided if each part of the quantity 
is multiplied by the whole multiplicand in one operation instead 
of by its parts in turn.

Division may be related to either of the two rules immediately 
preceding and shown as a shortened method of subtraction, 
multiplication is of addition, or as a reversing of multiplication. 
Before the teaching of the rule is actually begun, there must be 
preliminary-work, designed to get the children to understand the 
principle underlying it. In this, of course, we must make use of
-P-A-G-E-317
304 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
-concrete illustration, showing by means of actual operations with 
sticks, etc., that division is a shortened form of subtraction. 
E.g.,15— 5— 5—5=0, from which it is seen that in 15 there are 
three groups of 5, which can be taken away in three separate 
operations (subtraction), or, more quickly, in one (division). 
15>5=3 
When three groups of 5 have been taken from the 15, nothing 
is left. This proves that 15 is composed of three 5’s, which may 
_ be stated as 5 into 15 goes 3. Show this, step by step, thus: 
15 =} 1543 OF 3)15 
5—5= 0 = 
Remultiplying the 3 and the 5, we get 15 again. Here, the 
aspect of division which shows it as a reversal of multiplication 
is seen.

A number of such examples should be worked out with sticks, 
at first very simple ones, no difficulty being presented, but that of 
measuring a number which contains the divisor exactly. 
Later, examples involving remainders and “ carrying” down- 
wards should be given. 
Example.—Divide 99 sticks among four children (99 + 4). 
Call out 4 children. Bid one set out the dividend (the number 
which is to be divided) as 9 tens and 9 units. How many tens will 
there be for each child? Let each take 2 tens. 1 ten is left. 
This cannot be shared among 4 children as it stands. What is to 
be done? Bid a child break it up into units. It gives xo. Draw 
attention to the 9 units on the table. How many altogether? 
(9). These are to be divided among four children. How many 
will each get? Share out 4 to each. 3 remain. Can these be 
Givided equally among the 4 children? Can they be turned into 
anything smaller than units? (Not by children of this age, so
-P-A-G-E-318
The Teaching of Arithmetic 305 
accept the answer “ Nor’) Then what has each child got from 
the 99? 2 tens and 4 units, and there are besides 3 left over 
which cannot be shared among them equally. , 
State the example on the blackboard, and work out thus :

Note.—tThere is a difference of opinion whether the long or the 
shortened form of stating examples in division should’ be taught 
first. The more reasonable way is to begin with the longer, fuller, 
clearer statement. The shortened form will then be better appre- 
ciated later. On the other hand, there is little doubt that young 
children find short division easier. This, however, may arise from 
the fact that it has been customary in the past to teach short 
division first, and employ long division only in examples with 
divisors which necessitate its use. It is possible that, in this way, 
) a difficulty belonging rather to the numbers than the statement 
- has come to be associated with the latter. 
The terms divisor, dividend, quotient, and the sign + should 
be known and commonly used in connection with this rule. 
The finding of partial products necessary in the case of divi- 
\ sors having two digits is apt to give trouble, e.g. +   i 408 +17

The transition to the ordinary form of statement (6) should 
| follow examples worked out as in (a). It will then have a better 
chance of being understood. The difficulty, of course, is slightly 
i increased with the increase of the number of digits in the divisor. 
vu
-P-A-G-E-319
306 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
Statement (a) should therefore be resorted to again when: such 
increase is made. 
Division by factors should be attacked by methods "similar 
to those used in the case of multiplication, being introduced by 
practical exercises in money, common weights and measures. 
These should be followed by drawing exercises giving proof by 
diagram, and lastly by the arithmetical operations. 
The first exercise, again, may be with imitation coins; two 
children supplied with pencé and shillings respectively being re- 
quired to exchange them for a certain number of farthings supplied 
to a third child. 
Example. —Willie has 48 farthings, and wishes to change them 
for sixpences. How many should he get ? 
Method. Question of class: How many farthings in a penihy ? 
How many in sixpence? How many sixpences then for 48 far-

Next have the example worked through the pence and state as 
in (6) above. 
Note.—x. The necessity for the direct method of division and 
use of the factor method should be pointed out as in the case of 
multiplication. 
2, Exercises ‘involving remainders should. be left until later, 
although they present less difficulty in the case of concrete com- 
pound quantities than in the case of abstract numbers. 
__ Division by factors introduces the difficulty of remainders. “It 
is not easy for children to grasp the reason for the method adopted

for finding the full remainder in cases of division by factors each 
of which gives a remainder, and careful teaching will. be needed. 
The following example, to be worked with concrete objects, in- 
dicates the method to be followed. 
Example.—Divide (by factors) 496 sticks into groups of 63. 
Note.—Earlier examples should have proved to the pupils that 
dividing by the factors of a number gives the same result as divid- 
ing by the number itself directly. Attention, in the present one, 
should be fixed on finding the remainder, the rest of the operation 
takirig the children over old ground. 
Bid a child come to the table and set out 4 hundreds bundles, 
9 tens bundles, and 6 single ones. By reference to statement of 
example on blackboard, show the class that instead of dividing 
the sticks at once (or directly) into equal groups of 63, they are 
first to divide them into equal groups of 7 and then to make these 
into equal groups of 63 by putting 9 of the groups of 7 (=7x 9) 
together. The first division, made by breaking up the bundles as 
required, and dividing, shows 70 groups of 7, with 6 odd ones 
remaining. Division of these by 9 has next to be made, and is 
actually performed by putting the groups of 7 together by 9’s, 
the operation yielding 7 groups of 63 with 7 groups of 7 remaining. 
\ The full remainder is then seen to be 7 groups of 7 (=49)-+6 
| single ones=55 single ones. Your blackboard statement, having 
kept pace with the children’s concrete working, should show as 
{ below : - 
496 + 63 (factor method) 
| = 496+ (7 x9) 7496 single ones. 
| 63= X 9)7° groups of 7 with 6 single ones remaining. 
. 7 groups of 63 with 7 groups of 7 remaining. 
| “Answer ..=7 groups of 63 with 7 groups of 7 and 6 single ones 
remaining. 
=7 groups of 63 with 55 remaining, 
|. Note.—From your first dealing with remainders be careful to 
avoid as the best way of ensuring that your pupils avoid, the 
| false statement of the quotient as itself-+the remainder, eg. in 
"the first division above as 7046, which of coursé is 76 and—/alse. 
| A number of examples should be worked before the children
-P-A-G-E-321
308 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
are shown that as the first divisor always shows the number in 
the groups made from the first dividend, whilst the last remainder 
shows the number of groups over, the multiplying of these together 
will give the number of single ones remaining after the second divi- 
sion which, with the first remainder added in, gives the total re- 
mainder in single ones. The impossibility of adding groups to 
ones should be referred to and given as the reason for finding the 
total remainder in the way just examined. The rule should then 
be formulated by the children: To get the total remainder when 
dividing by factors, multiply the first divisor by the last remainder 
and add in the frst remainder. 
Note.—To children who have advanced as far as the e multipli 
cation and division of vulgar fractions, there is, of course, another 
method open for finding the total remainder—to turn the first 
remainder into a fraction by setting it upon the first divisor ; then, 
in the lower line, to add to this fraction the whole number over, 
turning the mixed number so made into an improper fraction, 
and dividing it by the second divisor (by giving it fractional] form, 
inverting it, and multiplying by it), In the example above, for 
instance, the 6 over from the first line would be written as s, the 
remainder 7 of the second dividend be added to it, giving 2 
== to be divided by? ,that is, multipled by? —the total remainder 
showing finally as 2 . 
Conversion of somerele quantities.—The ability to convert con- 
crete quantities from one denomination to another—as, for example, 
hundred-weights to pounds, quarts to gallons—is necessary before 
the four fundamental rules can be applied to them in exercises 
which require “carrying.” From the use of the rules in the case of 
the simple numbers, it will be best to pass first to their use in con- 
nection with sums of money, the “ tables ” for which are the easiest 
and most familiar, This practical use of the “tables” may be 
helpfully introduced by demonstrating with a similar “ table” for 
the simple rules— 
ro units==1 ten ; ro tens=1 hundred, ete.
-P-A-G-E-322
The Teaching of Arithmetic 309 
- One or two examples of simple rules worked by 10, 10, 10, 
may then precede money rules, by 20, 12, 4, and the rest, and at 
first the numbers should be written up thus : 
feo 32s. 4d. 
In early examples the addition of pounds, shillings, and pence 
only should be required, and these three lines of the compound 
sum be shown in comparison with the hundreds, tens, and units of 
simple addition. But, even before this can be done, the children 
must have been taught by previous practical and oral exercises, 
to convert pence into shillings and shillings into pounds, . 
Conversion of lower into higher denominations.—Ability to con- 
vert a quantity from a lower into a higher denomination (as, for 
example, pence into shillings) is ieeded in addition and multiplica- 
tion.. When the children, that is to say, in adding or multiplying 
sums of money, require to turn pence into shillings, they must 
know that for every 12 pennies they will have 1 shilling, and that, 
therefore, they will have as many shillings as they have 12 pennies, 
or their number of pence divided by 12. Similarly, when it is 
necessary to carry forward to the pounds all above 19 of the total 
number of shillings, they must know that there will be as many 
pounds to add as there are 20’s in the shillings, this number being 
found by dividing the shillings by 20. 
Conversion of higher into lower denominations.—This is necessary 
in subtraction and division. Whenever in subtracting, the number 
(cither of pence or shillings) is greater in the subtrahend than in 
the minuend, it will be necessary to take one of the next highest 
denomination and convert it into the lower denomination being 
dealt with. Thus if 7 pence have to be subtracted from 1 shilling 
and 6 pence, the shilling must be converted into 12 pence in order 
that it may be added to the 6 pence ; or, if 13 shillings have to be 
taken from £2,§8., one of the pounds must be converted into 20 
shillings and added to the five shillings to permit of the subtraction 
being performed. In these cases, however, the number of pence 
in a shilling, and of shillings in a pound will, or should, be so well 
known that the operation will not be consciously performed. 
Again, whenever in dividing there are any pounds or shillings 
over which require to be brought to the next lower denomination 
in order that the sharing process may be carried a step farther, con~

Vulgar Fractions. —Yeaching on vulgar fractions used to begin in 
Standard V. Now that it is introduced so much lower in the 
schoo) course than formerly, it must be almost entirely practical 
and experimental. There is reason for this earlier introduction in 
the fact that even children below school age have a practical know- 
ledge of fractions through such familiar parts as one-half and 
one-quarter. There is, therefore, no reason to put off dealing with 
them arithmeticaily till so late. When farthings are brought into 
money sums, the knowledge of how to write these parts in the 
conventional way becomes necessary, and from that time there is 
nothing to be urged against the extension of the teaching to other 
fractions with small denominators, while the value of the practice 
will be found in dealing with remainders in division. Still, 
systematic teaching on vulgar fractions—the application to them 
of the four rules in written exercises—should be left until Stan- 
dard IV. In Standard ITI the work should embrace no more than 
the oral addition and subtraction of such fractions as have de- 
nominators not exceeding twelve. 
In this oral work it will be found that the children are apt to 
add and subtract vulgar fractions having different denominators 
without changing these for one common to all the fractions in- 
volved—to add, for example, § and 3, and give, as answer, 3; or 
to take } from 3 and state that is left. 
The writing of the denominators in words instead of expressing 
them by the figure symbols in early examples, may help to impress 
the fact that the lower number in a vulgar fraetion as usually
-P-A-G-E-324
‘The Teaching of Arithmetic 31i 
expressed—for example, $—is neither more nor less than a name. 
The children will then be more likely to realise that just as it is 
impossible to add 6 cwts. to 5 lb., so it is impossible to add 
6 sevenths to 5 sixths. 
The exercises set at this stage should not necessitate the finding 
of L.C.M, and H.C.F. by the ordinary methods. As only fractions 
with deriominators up to and including 12 are to be dealt with, 
the method of inspection will serve well enough. 
It is advisable in the early stages of addition and subtraction 
to insist on the common denominator being repeated for each 
fraction—e.g., ++2=44,+%,, instead. of the shorter statement, 
t4+35 =? which should not be made till later. 
New difficulties arise in connection with multiplication and 
division. Both rules will be best illustrated by practical exercises 
with paper squares and the drawing of diagrams on squared paper. 
The first exercise in both is the applying of the rule in the case of 
a simple “‘ proper” fraction multiplied—or divided—by a whole 
number. The method of procedure is outlined below in the case 
of multiplication. For division, as the rule is a reversal of multi- 
plication,” the steps may simply be followed in reverse order. 
This is‘an‘argument in favour of teaching the two rules concur- 
rently: 
Multiplication. —(a) of a simple “ proper” fraction by a whole 
number, 
Example.—} x5. 
The children, being provided with five 4-inch squares (see (a) 
below) of paper, divided by pencil or ink lines into quarters, which 
they know both as quarters and fourths, should be directed to cut, 
or fold and tear, them into separate squares. From each of the four 
Hinch squares forming a whole, they should then be told to take 
three, so that they have 3, 5 times:, Next they should be required 
to count their separated }inch squares, when they will find that- 
they have 15 (see (b) below), i.e. 3 x5 4-inch squares, and finally to 
rearrange them in full (4 }-inch) squares., The result will then be 
seen (see (c} below) to be 32 4-inch squares.1 . 
State.on blackboard thus: 3? x5 =15 =33.

  Each division will then be a 3-inch square, and the whole figure 
contain 12 equal parts. The multiplicand 4 will then be represented 
by six of these parts which should be marked off from the rest, say, 
by the thickening of the horizontal line as in the figure. What i is 
now wanted is $ times this half, that is to say, 5 of the 6 divisions 
comprising it. Direct the children, therefore, to shade these in, to 
mark them off from the rest. As they represent 5 of the r2 sections 
forming the whole, the result of multiplying 3 by § is seen to be 45.

> The Teaching of Arithmetic 313 
Division —The result of division by a fraction presents difficulty 
to children who, while working with whole numbers have been used 
to finding the answers to division sums less than the number or 
quantity divided. In early examples it will be well to fix attention 
on the divisor by giving such as have whole numbers for the divi- 
dend. 
Reverting to knowledge familiar in the case of whole numbers, 
gain from the pupils such statements as 20+5=4; 20+1=20. 
Write these on the blackboard and, drawing attention to divisors and 
quotients, bid children note that when the divisor is so many times 
—in the example above, 5 times—less, the quotient is the same 
number of times greater. If, then, the divisor in the given example 
is again made five times less, becoming 4, the result will again be- 
come 5 times greater, i.e. 100. A number of such examples will 
accustom them to the apparent peculiarity of quotients larger than 
the given dividends. 
Continue examples having for divisors fractions with 1 for 
numerator until the children have discovered that to divide by 
4, for example, is the same thing as to multiply by 5. This 
should recall to them the fact, learnt during multiplication, 
that to. multiply by 4 is really to divide by 5. Next pass to 
examples in which the numerator is greater than 1. Still using 
1 the given dividend in illustration, we see that if 20+ 4 =100, 20+4 
will give a result 4 times less because the fraction ¢ is 4 times 
{ greater than 4. The answer, therefore, is too +4=25. Examina- 
tion will then show that the division of any number by 4 is 
performed when it has been multiplied by 5 (ze. divided by 3) 
and the result divided by 4; or, stated arithmetically, 20 (in this 
case)+$= 20 x$. Other examples will bring the children to the 
discovery that to divide by a fraction we invert it and multiply by 
it in its inverted form. 
Simplification. —Most of the mistakes made in simplify- 
ing complex fractions are caused either by neglect of the 
tule (multiply and divide before adding and subtracting) for 
getting rid of the signs in solving, or through failure to copy 
down the whole of the given fraction at each stage of the simpli- 
fication, 
To compel obedience to the rule of signs, we must insist from 
the first on our pupils bracketing off the fractions connected by x 
i arid + and reducing the parts of the given complex fraction within ect 2

one whole in the order given, until the various parts are simplified 
out step by step into one simple fraction expressed in its lowest 
terms. This plan may, at times, seem to involve unnecessary 
repetition, but confusion is sure to result if any other is followed. 
Decimal Fractions —The notation of decimal fractions must be 
shown in its relation to the notation of whole numbers and the 
principle of place value. Revising early lessons on whole numbers, 
we should remind our pupils that in the symbol 111, only one figure 
—that on the right—denotes the value of r unit. The middle and 
left-hand ones, owing to their position or place, have the value 
(hence, place value) of 1 x10 and x xro xzxo respectively. Then point 
out that if the value of figures increases by ro times with each 
remove to the left, it must decrease by just asmuch with each 
remove to the right. This the children know to be true between 
units and millions; but they have not hitherto been asked to 
consider the value of any figure placed to the right of the units. 
This is what they are now to be required to do, and intelligently- 
taught children of normal capacity will have no difficulty in see- 
ing and saying that the first one to the right of the units will have 
the value of 1 +10 (which their knowledge of vulgar fractions has 
taught them may be expressed as 7/,) the second of 5}, + 10 = z234, 
the third of -35+10= 59, and so on. As the writing down of 
these figures straight after the whole number 111 without any mark 
of division would make its impossible to tell where the fractional 
values began, the need for some mark will be readily seen by the 
pupils. The conventional mark should then be shown, and its 
advantage over any other? be pointed out.

The Teaching of Arithmetic 315 
Following the first lessons on decimal notation, oral exercises 
should give practice in multiplying and dividing fractions expressed 
in this notation until the children realise that all that is required 
is the moving of the decimal point so many places to the right or 
left, and can, work the exercises almost instantaneously. The 
decimalisation of money at sight—for example, 1os.=-5 of £1; 
§s.=-253 25. 6d.=-125; 25.=-1—Iis another valuable oral exer- 
cise at this point. For some time only terminating decimals 
should be involved in the exercises, 
In applying the four rules to decimal fractions reference should 
be made, for purposes of illustration, not only to similar work with 
whole numbers, but also to familiar practice in the case of vulgar 
fractions. 
Addition and Subiraction.—The setting down of examples in 
these rules should be preceded by reference to the setting down 
of similar sums in whole numbers—figures of equal place value 
being written under each other in both cases. The necessity of 
keeping these lines straight for the sake of clearness should be im- 
pressed. The reason for beginning addition or subtraction with that 
of the line in the right which contains the figures of lowest denomi- 
nation should be shown to be the same necessity for “ carrying,” 
in addition, and for “ decomposing” in subtraction as arises in 
the case of whole numbers. Early examples should be worked out 
both in decimal and vulgar form and the two answers compared. 
Midtiplication—This rule will be best illustrated by answers 
to examples being proved through working in vulgar fractions. 
E.g., +2'x+8 =-16, not, as might be expected, 1-6. Converting multi- 
plicand and multiplier into vulgar fractions shows that 4% x 8 = 
ify = +16. After a number of such examples, the children should 
beable to give the rule for placing the point in multiplication sums 
—namely, that there must be in the product the same number of 
decimal places as in multiplicand and multiplier together. 
Division.—In this rule the placing of the point presents more 
difficulty, and careful teaching will be needed. Before actual divi- 
sion is begun the fact that multiplying or dividing both divisor 
and dividend by the same figure, whatever it may be, makes no 
difference to the quotient, should be impressed through a number 
of examples, and comparison made with the cancelling of vulgar 
fractions. This fact enables us to convert all divisors, as is more 
convenient, into whole numbers by multiplying by a power of 10
-P-A-G-E-329
316 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
sufficiently high to effect.the change, if we multiply the dividend 
by the same power. Evg., -3259++175 may be converted into 
325-9175 by multiplying both dividend and divisor by rooo— 
the power of xo required to turn the latter into a whole number. 
Earlier oral examples, of course, should have shown that this multi- 
plication by rooo is performed in both cases by moving the decimal 
point three places to the right. This leaves, in the example above, 
one decimal place in the dividend. The fractional part of the 
quotient begins, of course, when all the whole numbers in the divi- 
dend being exhausted, the 9-tenths is brought down, and the point 
must be placed accordingly. We shall find it valuable to give much 
practice in such preparation of divisor and dividend for the opera- 
tion of division before requiring it to be actually carried through. 
Conversion.—There is a strong tendency noticeable on the part 
of pupils to convert all decimals into vulgar fractions before work- 
ing out examples. This, as a general rule, should be discouraged. 
In some cases it is better to make the conversion, but not in all, and 
pupils should acquire such facility in dealing with decimals, that 
they can follow the dictates of common sense in deciding whether, 
in any individual case, to work in decimals or vulgar fractions. 
Very frequently, a combination of the two notations gives the 
readiest solution, 
The work in fractions of both notations includes the conver- 
sion of vulgar fractions into decimals, and decimals into vulgar 
fractions. The fact that certain decimal and vulgar fractions are 
equal to each other becomes apparent in the early stages of teaching, 
and exercises in conversion result naturally. Early examples should 
deal with the conversion of such vulgar fractions only as make ter- 
minating decimals. When recurring decimals are introduced as 
the equivalents of vulgar fractions we must not be content simply 
to give the rule for conversion ; but must show the reason for it 
by working out on the blackboard with explanatory statement a 
sufficient number of examples, both of pure and mixed repeaters, 
to show why, in the first case, the decimal figures are taken for 
numerator and the denominator made of an equal number of 9’s ; 
and why, in the second, the non-repeating decimals are to be sub- 
tracted from the whole fraction to give the numerator, and in the 
denominator a 9 to be written for every repeating figure, followed 
by an o for every non-repeating one. : 
+ Metric System.—The metric system may be introduced in con-

nection with the fractional values of the decimal system previously 
learnt, the table of length being used to illustrate the decimal scale, 
‘The complete table should be given, and the significance of the 
prefixes explained. It may be written as: : . 
zo millimetres (mm.) =1 centimetre. 
zoo millimetres ~10 centimetres (cm.) =1 decimetre, etc. 
or, ast 
  x millimetre (mm.) =-oo1 metre = y7/55 metre. 
1 centimetre (cm.) =-o1 metre = >, metre. 
while for comparison with our ordinary notation the following 
chart * may be shown :   
7 
Thousands Hundreds Tens Units Point T.ths. H.ths. Th.ths. x . x x x x x x Kilometres Hectometres Decams. Metres . * ~ Decims. Centims. Millims, 
Note.—The relation of each lower and higher denomination to 
the unit (e.g. that the millimetre is the thousandth part (odes OF 
.001):of the metre) must be emphasized. The metric edge of the 
rule‘ will show the various measures. ‘ 
. Other tables should be introduced similarly, built experimentally 
if possible, and memorised. 
“ Practice.” —Exercises should be confined to examples that can 
be worked out without the aid of figures. Of course, for such work- 
ing, the quantities must be kept within certain limits, the price in 
the case:of the odd shillings or pence being calculable in not more 
than two easy aliquot parts. , 
"Such oral exercises on this “ rule ” as are given should deal first 
with prices at £1, plus such a number of shillings, or shillings and. 
penice;‘as makes an easy fraction. From the outset the-children 
should be taught to look for short methods of working, and to use 
them. If, for instance, the given price is £1, 13s. 4d., it should be 
calculated at £2 minus the price at 6s. 8d. (3) not at {1 plus the price 
at ros. plus the price at 3s. 4d. Teaching should also suggest the 
use of multiples of aliquot parts, and the pupils be accustomed to 
working not with 3 only, but also with 2; with # as well as with 3, 
and not.with 4 alone, but with 2, 2, and 4, etc. It is assumed that 
the table of aliquot parts will have been learnt before their use is 
required. “As'in the case of other oral exercises, the blackboard must

318 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
frequently be used for the purpose of showing the best ways of 
working. ; 
Proportion.—The difficulty ef getting children to grasp the 
meaning of a ratio is an argument in favour of teaching “ propor- 
tion” by the “ method of unity ” rather than by “ rule of three,” - 
and the former method ‘is now generally preferred. It gets its 
name from the fact that the answer is always obtainable by 
reckoning the cost, etc., of ome or unity, which stands between the 
first and second terms of the proportion forming the second line 
of the statement, as in the example below: 
Example.—It I buy 60 oranges for 5s. what should I pay for roo ? 
e 
60 oranges cost you 5s. 
58. bod. 
“. 1 orange would cost you jo 60 7 1d. 
and 100 oranges would cost you 1d. x100 =100d, =8s. 4d. 
Another argument in favour of the unitary method is the fact 
that-it makes a commonsense application of fundamental rules 
and is therefore more likely to be used by the pupils in after life. 
Further, “ direct ” and “ inverse” proportions present less difficulty 
when the method of unity is employed. Working by “rule of 
three,” pupils are apt to place the first and second terms in hap- 
hazard fashion, because the reasoning on which the statement is 
based is not clear to them. Working by the unitary method, how- 
ever, even a dull child must see that (to take, as an instance, 
the “direct ” example above) if 60 oranges cost 5s., 1 orange will 
cost 5s. divided by 60=1d., and 100, 1d. x1oo, Similarly, in the 
following “inverse.” example: If 25 men do a piece of work in 
6 days, how long would 50 men take to do it ? it will be apparent 
that 1 man would take 25 times as long as 25 men, and 50 men 50 
times less than 1, and that, therefore, the 6 days must be muliiplied 
by 25-and the answer so gained divided by 50. 
When the pupils are able to work exercises in proportion readily, 
examples containing additional terms, unnecessary in solution, 
should be given for the purpose of testing intelligence—e.g. A wall 
33 feet long was built by 9 men in 27 days. What length of wall 
would r2 men have built? Oral exercises should give preliminary 
practice in throwing out such terms.
-P-A-G-E-332
  The Teaching of Arithmetic 319 
It isnot proposed to deal in any detail with the method of teach- 
ing the remaining “ rules ” and applications. The methods advo- 
cated in connection with the first introduction of the various rules 
and principles in lower standard work, should suggest their own 
development in the higher stages, for no new principles are involved. 
All new work, whatever the application, must be approached i ina 
common-sense way, the children being led.to see it in its relation 
to what has gone before. : 
Compound Proportion—In “ simple” proportion examples, 
pupils are required to find the change in one. number, amount, or 
quantity resulting from a change in oe other. In that given on 
a previous page, for instance, the change in the cost (5s.) of oranges 
had to be determined, when, the number bought was changed from 
60 to roo, In “compound” proportion more. than two numbers, 
amounts or quantities are involved, and the. change in one of 
them, consequent upon given changes in the others, has to be 
found. This will be seen in the following examples : 
(x) If 16 oxen plough 27 acres in 12 days, how many acres will 
32 oxen plough in 18 days? 
In‘12 days 16 oxen plough 27 acres. 
“. 5, rday. 16 ,, will plough 27 acres+-12= 2} acres. 
o. wdays16 5 4, 4, 2facresx18= = 40} | acres. 
". 5) Idaysr 4, 4 4, 40h acres+16= 24% acres. 
. 4, Hdays32oxen ,, ,, 2bgacres x32= Brac acres. 
.. the number of acres =81. 
The example requires the finding of the change in the number 
of acres ploughed, consequent on the change in the number of oxen 
(from 16 to 32), and in the number of days allowed (from 12 to 18). 
Inthe first three lines of the statement the number of days is changed 
from 12 to.18 without any change being made in the number of 
oxen ; in the last three lines the number of oxen is changed from 
16 to ‘ps 2 
(2) Ifa 5 boys can do a piece of work i in 36 days, how many boys 
can do a piece of work 5 times as great in one-sixth of the time ? 
The work can be done in 36 days by 15 boys. 
oe ” ” rday ,, 15 boys x 36= 540 boys. 
Pay we 38 days ,, 540 boys+ 6= 90 boys. 
SX a oy ” 6 days ,, 90 boys x 5= 450 boys.
-P-A-G-E-333
320 "The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
In this example it is unnecessary to have a line of statement for 
the unit in stating the change in the amount of the work, since the 
terms are referred to the unit of work in the earlier lines. In both 
examples, it may be noticed, the problem is re-stated in several lines, 
in such a way that the number, the change in which is to be dis- 
covered, comes last. Such a rearrangement is necessary in all ex- 
amples. It may be noted, too, that each of these “ compound ”’ 
examples is made up of separate “ simple ” ones—herice the name 
The first three lines represent the first simple proportion, and the 
remaining ones, which make use of the answer to that, the second, 
“Compound ” proportion is, therefore, seen to consist of a series 
of “simple” examples, in which every later one is based on the 
answer to that preceding. The number of simple proportions in 
the series increases with the number of terms necessary to solution. 
Percentages.—In percentages there is really no new principle 
involved, but old ones are applied to unfamiliar uses, and some oral 
teaching will be necessary. The “rule” should be connected with 
fractions—vulgar and decimal—and the. fact emphasized that a 
percentage is, itself, really a fraction of which the denominator— 
unexpressed—is 00, just as a decimal was previously shown to 
be one with the denominator 10 or some power of 10. 
In the first stage of the work the idea and meaning of percentages 
should be conveyed by the aid of graphic illustrations, and a per- 
centage represented, as has been said, as a fraction with the denomi- 
nator roo. Then exercises in conversion to and from decimal 
fractions should be'given. Others requiring the value of a given 
percentage of any given quantity, and the addition and subtraction 
- of a given percentage, should follow, and subsequently applications 
to easy problems. The second stage should require the finding of 
cost price, the selling price and percentage of profit or loss being 
given ; and the finding of gain or loss through a change of selling 
price, the gain or loss per cent. at a given selling price being stated. 
The third stage should consist of revision exercises and problems. 
Similar exercises should be given in the case of other than money 
percentages. - . 
Pupils should not be taught to look upon simple interest, profit 
and loss, discount, partnerships, profit-sharing, and insurance as 
Separate rules, but as various applications of the principle of per- 
Gentages. The new terms involved by these variations should 
be explained incidentally as they occur. “
-P-A-G-E-334
The Teaching of Arithmetic 321 
Simple Interest—The course of teaching in simple interest 
should make use of the knowledge of decimals and percentages 
previously acquired by the pupils, and present a series of carefully 
chosen and graduated examples for solution. From the results 
gained in the course of these exercises, the class should be led to 
discover and formulate a general law or rule to be used in working 
out further examples. 
The subject may be introduced through a number of examples 
to be worked mentally, the answers only being written down. Of 
such examples the following is a type :—A borrows £300 of B, and 
for the loan of it pays £3, 15s. quarterly. What would he pay per 
annum for the Joan of {100 at the same rate ? 
Oral exercises, very briefly worded and leading to the rule, 
should follow. Chosen examples should deal with sums of money 
within the limits of the pupils’ mental grasp and possible experi- 
erice—as, for instance, small sums borrowed for a short period, or 
small investments. Questions on simple interest should, as a rule, 
be confined to loans of no longer than a year’s duration. Shorter 
periods of time, 6, 4, 3, 2, and 1 month, will give useful practice. 
Compound Interest, again, must not be introduced as a new 
tule, but shown as an application of continued ratio. Early work 
should be concerned with definitions and explanations of the system. 
This would include an explanation of the method of investing 
money at compound interest, and illustration, in connection with 
small sums of money, of the points in which it differs from simple 
interest, Exercises moderately easy employing the method and 
reckoning the interest (a) yearly, (6) for longer periods than a year, 
should then be required. In a course of oral lessons, illustrated 
by examples, compound interest should then be shown as con- 
tinued ratio in such a way as to lead the children to discover the 
conventional method of working and the reason for it.t 
Square Root.—The subject of squares and square roots should 
be introduced by preparatory oral lessons which have for their 
aim the explanation of the terms. One lesson should deal with 
whole numbers, one with decimal, and a third with vulgar fractions. 
Squared paper and drawing materials will be required for these 
lessons. : 
By drawing exercises, first, the pupils should be brought to

matics, Book VIL, pp. 60-62. :

322 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
the knowledge that a square with its side 4 units in length, divided 
horizontally or vertically to show that it contains 4 strips each 
consisting. of 4 unit squares, contains in the whole square 
4X4 (=16) unit squares. Hence, in the case of numbers only, 
4% 4 (or 16) is the square of 4. - 
By illustrations, next, from. the square measure table it 
should be pointed out that the square foot shows 12 x 12 (= 144) 
as the square of 12; and the square yard 3x3 (=9) as the 
square of 3. 
By Blackboard statement the method of writing should then 
be shown—4 X 4 as 4, 12 X 12 as 127, and 3 x 3 as 3%. . 
By arithmetical ‘examples—chiefly oral—these facts should 
be impressed. 
By further drawing exercises, consisting of squares variously 
divided into smaller ones (¢.g. 1 square foot divided into 144 square 
iriches and seen to have length of sides 12 inches), it must then be 
shown that 12 is the base or root of the square 144, and (by other 
squares) that 3 is the base of the square 9, and 4 the base of the 
square 16; that these are, therefore, called the square root of 144, 
9 and 16 respectively, and are written “/144, V9, and-/76. By 
other drawings it should be demonstrated that it is impossible to 
make squares which contain 10, 15 or 20 unit squares, and so the 
term perfect square be introduced. 
By arithmetical examples! these ‘new facts must then be 
impressed. 
Note.—The lessons dealing with the squares and square roots 
of vulgar and decimal fractions should follow similar lines. 
This chapter should not be closed without reference to the de- 
sirability of all student-teachers gaining sufficient knowledge of 
elementary geometry and algebra to enable them to ‘teach these 
subjects, the one throughout, and the other in the higher divisions 
of the school course. : : : 
It is impossible to deal with the teaching of these branches 
of mathematics in this book, as the inadvisability of assuming at 
present a sufficient knowledge of: them for teaching purposes on 
the part of student-teachers, would result in the taking up of more 
space than.can be given to them. Some reasons for their inclusion 
in the elementary school courses of the Union generally, will, 
however, be in place. - :

The Teaching of Arithmetic . 323 
Geometry as geometry is not the main aim of the teaching of 
this. branch of mathematics in the. elementary - school, but the 
illustrating by its means of the processes.of arithmetic by graphic 
representation. In order, however, that this purpose may be 
served the teaching must follow: a definitely planned and 
reasonable. order, and convey clear. ideas of its fundamental 
principles. 
At first we should avoid formal definitions and simply. strive 
to make our pupils familiar with certain of the terms used in 
geometry—as, for example, straight-line angle, circle—and.to show, 
not merely to tell, the meaning of them, avoiding. looseness of 
expression as far as possible, even while: withholding, as statéd, 
formal. definitions. Secondly, we should show how certain 
mechahical exercises in connection with the study are to be 
performed ; and thirdly, should train, through these exercises, a 
habit of observation which will lead the children from the noting 
of particular facts to the finding and formulating for themselves 
of general laws. Even while confining ourselves to these aims, 
we shall find it possible to make these early exercises form a firm 
foundation for the more formal and exact work required in later 
stages. 
From the beginning the study of geometry must be made 
experimentally—the children learning by doing. All exercises 
should be worked out by them under our instructions, while by 
well-directed questions we draw their attention to the points to 
be. noted. Repetition of the various exercises at the time they 
are first given, and revision some time later, should be used to 
make their grasp on their acquired knowledge firm. 
The value of an ability to substitute in arithmetical exercises 
literal (L. iteralis—litera==a letter) symbols as in algebra, for values 
expressed by numbers, is so unquestionable that the total neglect 
of algebraic methods is unwise even in the elementary stages 
of the subject. There is no plea of difficulty to urge against the 
use of them, for children can be taught, as their power of abstrac- 
tion ‘increases, to appreciate the meaning of 7+ 3x almost as 
Teadily as they did that of 7 boys +3 boys at an earlier age. The 
solution of many problems is most easily found by use of algebraic 
symbols and methods, as, for instance, those which involve pro- 
portion... Apart from this, progress from the working of arithmetical 
exercises: by: use of concrete objects, proper to the early stages o
-P-A-G-E-337

teaching, to the abstract calculation required in later ones, only 
reaches its logical end in algebra, and, unless the work is carried 
to this conclusion, the mental training to be derived from it remains 
incomplete. 
To study geometry and algebra as branches of our own edu- 
cation—as students first and last, that is—is one thing ; to study 
them as teachers, feeling the necessity of instructing children in 
them, quite another. We ourselves need both the student’s and 
the teacher’s knowledge, and the ordinary students’ text-book 
does not give all we need to know of the subject, as teachers. Both 
geometry and algebra form part of the scheme put forward in 
Longmans’ Practical Arithmetics, from which frequent quotations 
have been made in the present chapter. Methods of teaching 
both subjects are very fully given in the “ Teachers’ Series,” while 
examples for working will be found in the accompanying pupils’ 
books. Apart from this, the intelligent use of these books for 
class work would do much to improve the present teaching of 
arithmetic. :

THE TEACHING OF SINGING 
* Blest be the song that brightens 
The blind man’s gloom, exalts the veteran’s mirth. 
For the tired slave, song lifts the languid oar, 
And bids it aptly fall, with chime 
That beautifies the fairest shore 
And mitigates the harshest clime. 
Nor friendless he, the prisoner of the mine, 
Who from the well-spring of his own clear breast 
Can draw, and sing his griefs to rest.” WoRDsworRTH. 
‘«, . , the truest, simplest, usefullest . . . music . . . the truest, that in 
which the notes most closely and faithfully express the meaning of the words, 
or the character of intended emotion; again, the simplest, that in which the 
meaning and melody are attained with the fewest and most significant notes 
possible ; and, finally, the usefullest, that music which makes the best words 
most beautiful, which enchants them in our memories each with its own glory 
of sound, and which applies them closest to the heart at the moment we 
need them.”—RUSKIN. 
Sincinc, properly taught, is for both teacher and children one of 
the most enjoyable of school subjects, and the time given to it 
should be regarded as a time of relaxation rather than of work, 
It is also one of the most educative of school subjects. Like the 
performing of measured movements in physical drill and the read- 
ing and reciting of poetry, it stirs the emotions and the imagination 
and at the same time subjects them to control, The enjoyment 
is most keen, and the educative process—shown in a growing 
sensitiveness to harmony and rhythm—is most sure when in the 
songs chosen for singing, tuneful music is wedded to noble words. 
Song is one of the best and earliest possible means of awakening in 
children a sense of pleasure in beauty ; and it has the additional

value of lending itself to out-of-school practice, thus linking class- 
room exercise with home pleasures. This association is so impor- 
tant that we should make a point of encouraging our pupils to 
sing their school songs at home.: 
Our singing lessons may and should give our pupils a sense of 
fellowship with us in enjoyment, tending to make our government 
of them more easy, not during singing lessons only, but at all times. 
The sharing in any pleasure of a high order makes for those friendly 
relations that should be part of our educative aim. 
Pleasure in singing discourages a taste for lower pleasures, and 
if our pupils learn to feel it during their school years, they will 
be less likely, later, to find enjoyment in questionable ways of 
amusing themselves. Children who leave school with some know- 
ledge of music and some power of musical expression may find 
in most towns and villages an opportunity of extending the one and 
exercising the other, and so of adding to their social pleasures. 
But these results will not be brought about unless we remember 
that our pupils’ pleasure in their singing lessons is beund up with 
the singing of songs. They will soon lose interest if we have any 
other aims than those of enabling them to sing more songs and 
prettier songs, to sing them better, and to feel more enjoyment 
when they hear a good song’ well sung by some one else. All our 
teaching must have one of these ends in view—not only in our 
own view, but also in our pupils’. We must remember, too, that 
throughout their school years most children like singing themselves 
better than listening to others. They will be content with the 
pleasure of: listening, occasionally ; but, generally speaking, what 
we sing to them ourselves or get someone else to sing to 
them, should be meant as a model for them to try to imitate 
in the not too distant future. Of course, if our pupils have 
heard and practised singing very little it will be wise to sing 
songs to them pretty often, to awaken their interest in singing 
and their desire to sing; but when they can sing, we may be 
sure that. they will want to do so as much as possible. Our 
own. singing, then, should be reserved for special purposes, such 
as helping them to feel the “spirit” of a song we are teaching 
them, or'to show them beforehand what will be the result of some 
necessary drill. 
Our aims, of course, will decide our practice. For little children 
the quickest way of learning to sing is to learn by ear.’ But just
-P-A-G-E-341
328 The School, the Child, and the ‘Teacher 
as they only learn to speak (which, also, they do “‘ by ear,” that is 
by hearing and afterwards imitating) after having heard the speech 
of others for a. considerable time, so they will only begin to sing 
when they have heard a good deal of singing. If their mothers 
and sisters have sung to them throughout babyhood they will have 
learnt to sing’ a little, before coming to school; but because all 
children do not have singing mothers or sisters we shall find it 
necessary in infant classes to let the children hear us sing many 
songs—pretty songs with easy, “ catchy ” tunes and simple words. 
Nursery rhymes set to music are very suitable. We should invite 
the children to join in the singing as soon as they feel that they 
know the tune, and though we may suggest that they should 
“listen again” if we find that they are singing out of tune, we 
must be careful not to discourage their early efforts. The tune 
will come by degrees—sooner, in most cases, by their trying to 
sing than by their listening merely. We shall hear which notes 
are wrong and can sing those over and over again. 
Lessons in the Sub-Standards should be given up to this chiefly. 
The notes which form the alphabet of music should be taught 
later, just as the teaching of reading is put off until the children 
have learnt to talk and taken part in story-telling. The infant 
school is the place for teaching by ear. We must let the children 
learn in this way as many good and pretty songs as we have 
time for. This is “learning to talk” in music, and it must come 
before learning to read as it does in language. Reading cannot be 
taught successfully until the children are able to speak fairly easily. 
Even in the standards singing by ear should not be given up 
altogether, though less time can be spared for it when our pupils 
begin note-reading. Until they can do this with ease at a fair 
rate of speed the earlier method will be the quicker way of teach- 
ing new songs, and as we have seen it is important that many 
songs should be learnt. We can, moreover, make use of songs 
taught in this way to give further training. We may, for instance, 
help the children to make out their rhythms and afterwards have 
them written down ; and we may also use the tunes for the exer- 
cises on open vowel sounds that are a necessary part of voice- 
training. A third possible use is that of choosing certain of the 
phrases as ear tests, the children being required to write them down 
or point theni out on the modulator. 
Whenever our lessons deal with the theory of music we must
-P-A-G-E-342
The Teaching of Singing 329 
remember that all we teach our pupils must be taught with the 
aim of helping them to enjoy more their singing and hearing of 
songs, Without some knowledge of the theory of music there 
can be no development of their power to render and enjoy music ; 
but we must never lose sight, nor allow them to lose sight, of the 
reasons for which we teach any part of it. 
Modulator work and time notation are usually. started in Stan- 
dard I ; but-both should be regarded as the word- -building of singing. 
. When taking the preliminary time and tune drill, we should have 
a song in mind to which we mean to epply it. The following + is 
suitable : 
{\" im [fo cs |s if in gr \a :do|roim |" wo jr | 
{{" im |f 38 \8 rf [mir |@ sdo[rocn id fd c— | 
There is no difficulty in either notes or time ; and with a very 
little preliminary drill the song could be almost read at sight, and 
would arouse far more interest and effort than the isolated time and 
tune tests which are too frequently all the reading of music that 
the Standard I exercises afford. There is nothing better than a 
well-known tune for modulator practice. In’singing, as in reading, 
it should be our aim to get away from the dry drill-work to inter- 
esting passages as soon as possible. The best time tests and the 
best tune tests will be those which are taken from good songs. 
In giving ear tests we should bear in mind that they demand 
the reverse process to note- -reading, and occasionally should require 
note-writing of the children in answer to them. We should not 
give these tests at random, for music must be looked on as having 
meaning. It contains phrases and sentences as reading does, and 
ear tests, like those in time and tune, should be given in phrases— 
necessarily short, at first—in order to bring out the meaning. In 
this part of musical training, again, we shall be most successful 
when our tests, instead of being isolated, are given during the teach- 
ing of songs. ‘They should concern themselves with rhythms as 
well as with the pitch of notes,

creasing in difficulty with the progress of the pupils. This gradua- 
tion of the work is the important point, We teach reading by the 
same method throughout the standards, but the pieces read are 
graduated in difficulty and mere drill work is given up more and 
more as.we make progress, though some—for special purposes— 
is always retained. So it should be with singing. Each new song 
should be a little in advance of the last, and whatever is new in the 
notation should be taught beforehand by means of drill. But, if we 
always remember that drill in singing is just the word-building of 
reading, we shall naturally use it only as needed, and drop it as soon 
as it has served its purpose. 
The similarity between reading and singing and the consequent 
similarity of method in teaching the two subjects being borne in 
mind, the need for a musical reader will be felt.1_ In early reading 
books the plan consists of drills by means of spelling lists followed by 
passages based on each—first a drill and then a passage, the former 
assisting in the reading of the latter and both graded in diffi- 
culty throughout the book. A good musical reader should be 
written on the same plan ; necessary drill in notation—either given 
or indicated to be taken on the blackboard—then a song applying 
it; then a step forward in drill in preparation for a step forward in 
song and so on throughout. Of course it does not follow in the case 
of the musical reader any more than in that of the ordinary literary 
reader that the children should never be given practice outside the 
book. All songs of suitable nature and difficulty are open to them 
for this purpose, just as are all suitable stories for reading. The 
purpose of the reader in both cases is to treat difficulties systemati- 
cally, and to train the taste—in the one case for good literature and 
in the other for good music. 
Blackboard exercises should follow the plan of a good 
musical reader. They should not be mere tests set for the purpose 
of seeing whether the children can perform them, without any 
reference at all to the musical-side of the work. So-called time 
tests must not be merely length-of-note tests ; for time in. music 
involves rhythm. The same care is needed in setting blackboard 
exercises in time and.tune. Too often the notes are set down in 
haphazard fashion, and their length is decided in the same way. 
We must have a melody running through our mind when writing

field, England, is recommended.

them, and keep thinking how it will sound when sung. What should 
we think of a reading book made by throwing the words together 
at random, or to include all the difficulties possible for their own 
sake without regard for the sense? But this is what is done in such 
tests. They are opportunities for musical gymnastics, but they are 
not music. Everything tends to become a “ test” ; we have time 
tests, ear tests, note tests, and teaching very frequently has to give 
way to them. Testing is good in its right place ; but it is mainly 
the examiner’s work, and it should, as a rule, be left to him. We 
should use it only when we wish to see if something that we have 
taught. has been learnt—not in a nervous endeavour to find out 
whether the children are ready for the inspector. Teaching should 
consist of training, not of testing ; and when testing is necessary 
it should be done with regard for the aim of training. Music should 
be tested by means of music, as reading is tested by means of 
reading, and not by means of drills. 
What is the aim of the musical training referred to above ? 
Why do we teach reading? Chiefly to give our pupils power 
to feast their minds on all the best that has been written, and also 
to give.them the inclination. Reading lessons in this sense are a 
means, not.an end. Our pupils are to care to read only what is 
worth reading, and we shall make them appreciate such literature 
if we love it ourselves and feel the need of their doing so. It is 
the same with music. In both cases we are really aiming at 
character through what we know to have an influence on character 
—the experience of an uplifting enjoyment that appeals both to 
the senses and to the mind. 
With this end in view we must teach as many good songs as 
possible. What is a good song for school children? First, the 
tousic must be good ; and it can be good and simple at the same 
time. The words must not be beyond their powers of understand- 
ing and appreciation, for the song must have present value, that is, 
must appeal to the children at their present stage of development. 
It must"be: also of enduring value—one of which they will not 
tire, but.which, when they are older, they will still enjoy, whether it 
is sung-by:themselves or by others. . 
Here, perhaps, is the place to say a few words to encour- 
age those-who are despondent or lack confidence in their musi- 
cal power, :There is no teacher worthy of the name who 
cannot..understand the educational aim in teaching music.- No
-P-A-G-E-345
332 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
teacher should be discouraged and give up because he cannot 
play, or even if he cannot sing. If he grasps the educational 
importance of music ‘he will be urged to train himself; and very 
few are hopeless musically.. Moreover a poor musician with the 
right aim is likely to do more good as a teacher of singing than a 
good musician without it. 
If character-training is the purpose of teaching singing, then it 
should go without saying that all the children in every class must 
have the benefit of it. Yet it is not an unknown practice for certain 
children to be excluded from the singing lessons because in the 
teacher’s opinion “they have no ear for music” and perhaps 
“ spoil the singing of the others.” Are there, one wonders, suffi- 
cient grounds for this opinion? It may be true that the ear is 
undeveloped in children who sing out of tune ; but this, surely, 
is reason for giving them not fewer singing lessons or none, but 
more—as many as time can be found for in odd minutes snatched 
at the beginning or end of the school sessions or during recess. 
As singing is both a pleasurable and a healthful exercise, there is 
absolutely no objection to the practising of a singing class of back- 
ward pupils in the playground at playtime. In class these back- 
ward pupils may be enjoined to sing softly listening to the others. 
Even were it necessary to stop their singing altogether for a time 
they should still be admitted to the singing lessons—not set to “ do 
sums ” or “learn spellings” in the time—that they may have the 
pleasure of listening and the benefit of such ear-training as it 
affords. It will often be found that the child whose ear is con- 
sidered most defective finds a keen pleasure in singing songs. ‘This 
is surely a reason for reconsidering the decision as to his musical 
hopelessness. Such apparently hopeless cases should be tried 
individually once a quarter, as there is always a possibility of the 
sympathy between ear and voice developing. The keenness of an 
ear for music is so much a matter of training received even before 
school years begin, that we must expect wide differences in this 
respect between one child and another. The child who has been 
sung to sleep in infancy by soft lullabies in his mother’s voice, and 
who has been accustomed to the lilting of nursery rhymes and 
jingles in his early games with her, will be far in advance of the 
child whose babyhood has known no such happy influences. Children, 
again, who have had some oddity of tone or some initial difficulty in 
picking up tunes, and have been checked or laughed at on account

far behind the main body of the class through lack of 
the nervous shyness such treatment causes. There is, 
more reason for devoting special time to them. No 
ry the name will sacrifice the individual needs of back- 
o the desire for a better general effect or to the deter-. 
sain a good report. 
-has been proved that children can be taught to read 
: at a very early age, the training in formal sight- 
Id not. begin too soon. ‘The Sub-Standards may 
age be given to preparatory work—to the teaching 
of separate musical signs (printed in large characters) and the 
informal association of them from time to time with the sounds 
for which they stand. Almost more beneficial, however, at this 
age-—allowing as it does for muscular movement—is the asso- 
ciation of sounds with hand-signs. The tonic sol-fa notation is 
the one best adapted to this stage of the work, but we should aim 
at developing the power to read the older staff notation not only 
on account.of the immensely larger amount of music written in 
that notation, but because of the help it may for this reason give 
to pupils who are learning some musical instrument. It will be 
| found, in practice, that the staff notation may be successfully 
troduced in Standard IV. It should not be attempted before 
is, as it is. too. complicated for younger scholars. In teaching, 
ch step-in the staff notation must be explained by the corres- 
mding, .step—previously learnt—in the newer notation. The 
aching of reading at sight only demands on the part of teachers 
trained ear; and, as this is within the reach of all who earnestly 
iltivate it; success waits upon effort. 
Care ‘and cultivation of the voice during school years are impera- 
wely necessary in order that the adult voice may not be injured, 
ut may:come to its full power and beauty. The first essential of 
ood toned 4 correct breathing in pure air, and for this reason the 
practice: of.breathing exercises in a well-ventilated room is a pre- 
liminary ofsthe singing lesson that must never be omitted. Great 
¥ care must-be given to voice production through exercises in attack i and release; for strengthening the thin (or “head ”) register, for 
! giving flexibility, ‘and for promoting the tuning and blending of 
4 voices in tlass practice, Not only will these exercises give agreeable 
+ tone toisehool ‘singing; but by preserving and developing the natural:quatities of their voices, they will make it possible for the 
    
-P-A-G-E-347
334 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
pupils to join choral societies when school years are over and thus 
to.continue their musical education in later life. 
In. the absence of proper instruction, children are apt to form 
the bad and injurious habit of singing only in the lower register. 
As this lower, chest (or “ thick”) register cannot be forced above 
its natural limits without doing injury to the voice, it is very im- 
portant to train children in the right use of the different regis- 
ters. When an ascending scale is sung, a change in the quality of 
the voice occurs, it will be noticed, when C' or D! is reached 
above which the higher head (or “ thin’) register is used. This 
is the proper voice to cultivate in children. Practice for a few 
minutes daily will ensure its use if the exercises set begin on D', 
E! flat, or E' and continue downwards, and if the pupils are en- 
joined to sing softly. Good vowel sounds for practising “ thin ” 
register exercises are 00 (as in too) and o (as in oh). The exercises 
should be taken slowly as well as softly. For the best results in 
singing, continuous daily practice is needed, several short lessons 
in the week being better for voice-training purposes than one or 
two long ones. 
A very important part of voice production deals with 
the clearness of words in singing. While musical tone is pro- 
duced by dwelling on the vowel sounds, clearness of words de- 
pends upon the clearness with which consonants are sounded. 
Good singing will show both these qualities. Consonants in 
singing must be very clearly uttered in order that the word may 
be distinctly heard by those who are listening. A little more 
effort must be made than in speaking or reading, partly because 
the dwelling on the vowels tends to “ crowd out” the consonants 
in words, and partly also because, as the music takes part of the 
hearers’ attention, the words must be forced upon them, 
Singing in unison rather than part-singing should be the general 
tule in school practice ; but as part-singing is a useful musical 
accomplishment in adult life, there should be occasional practice 
of rounds, catches, and part-songs. In the case of part-songs it 
should be borne in mind that the compass of the different voices 
will usually vary very little in a class of children, and that: only 
two-part pieces, and even of those only such as have not a low 
alto, should be used. Three-part songs will be apt to strain the 
voices of those who take the first and third parts. The distinctively 
treble and alto notes of voices do not develop till a later age, and
-P-A-G-E-348
The Teaching of Singing 335 
to force them earlier would be to spoil the voice irremediably. 
The children who sing alto one day should sing treble the next 
or their head register notes will remain undeveloped, and those of 
their chest register be unduly exercised. 
So far we have not considered fully the important matter of 
the choice of songs. National or “folk” songs which express in 
homely language the joys and griefs of a people, their love of home 
and country, of sport and of the simple pleasures of rural life, are 
among the best if their words are suitable. This, however, is not 
always the case, and care must therefore be given to the choice 
of them. South Africa cannot at the present stage of her history 
offer her children many such songs; but, remembering what has 
been said of guarding against narrowness and want of international 
sympathy, we shall see the advantage, while keeping an open ear 
for what the home country may have to offer, of choosing them in 
the meantime from other sources—from among the songs of Eng- 
land, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Holland, Germany and France.! 
These songs — “the early and spontaneous uprising of artistic 
power in a nation ’—composed in a simpler age than our own, 
make an immediate appeal to the simple emotions of childhood, 
and so may be effectively rendered by young pupils : 
“The songs chosen for infants should be musically as simple as 
possible ; but it is not necessary that infants should understand 
all the words they sing, as the chief appeal is not to the intellect, 
the training of which is the purpose of almost every other subject 
in the curriculum ; but through the spirit of song to the uncon- 
scious mind of the child. . . . Scholars in the higher classes may 
usefully sing carefully selected songs from the music of other 
countries and these (apart from their value as music) may be so 
chosen as to convey an impression, truthful as far as it goes, of 
the characteristic traditions and traits of other races.” * 
To.the national songs there may be added for the higher classes 
a few selected songs from the great masters (such as are used in 
Training Colleges) for the cultivation of taste. These, like most

336 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
of the songs used in the school, should, for the reasons given, be 
generally arranged for unison singing. 
While for school entertainments and other such occasions songs 
which are not classical may be’ allowed, the choice should always 
be made with care, after due deliberation on the question whether 
“the best ” will not serve the purpose of the entertainment equally 
well. . Much of the music published for performance on such occa- 
sions is without educative value, and in music as in literature 
“ even the good is the enemy of the best.” 
The foregoing suggestions, of course, make no attempt to do 
more than indicate the broad lines on which the teaching of singing 
should be conducted. A handbook on the subject is’ an absolute 
necessity for teachers of singing, and a very practical one will be 
found in The School Teacher's Music Guide. This contains a 
chapter on breathing and voice production ; explanations and 
instructions for the teacher who may not have had much 
opportunity for studying the tonic sol-fa notation; numerous 
examples of the tonic sol-fa method applied to the staff as well 
as to the letter notation ; hints and devices for the help of the 
teacher who wishes to avoid getting into a rut, and to adopt fresh 
ideas for stimulating the musical perceptions of his pupils, together 
with a number of exercises for improving the teacher’s own 
executive skill.

CHAPTER XIV 
THE TEACHING OF DRAWING 
“So, in drawing, as soon as you can set down the right shape of any- 
thing, and thereby explain its character to another person, or make the look 
of it clear and interesting to a child, you will begin to enjoy the art vividly 
for its own sake, and all your habits of mind and powers of memory will gain 
precision; but if you only try to make showy drawings for praise or pretty 
ones for amusement, your drawing will have little of real interest for you and 
no educational power whatever.’’—RUSKIN. 
“From the immediately practical point of view, it may be said that a 
child has not been properly educated unless he can grasp, through mind and 
eyes, sufficient of the characteristics of the forms he sees around him to en- 
able him to draw them as readily as he can write or repeat the words that he 
hears, . .. On no account must drawing be practised for the mere purpose 
of producing pretty pictures: it should be regarded as a vehicle to assist 
expression in the child’s daily life and study. All drawing should be taught 
as a language, not as an art, and be used as an instrument, not as a play- 
thing.” —W. W. Rawson, 
‘Nor do we regard drawing as a mere accomplishment or an accidental 
gift the possession of the few. Like speaking and writing it is a means of 
expression, and therefore a necessary factor in all true education, Moreover, 
it is one in which children naturally delight, and may even be said to rival 
both speaking and writing as a vehicle of thought... . As a method of 
expression it is facile and exact, and as the world owes much to its great 
artists, so the schools owe much to the great teachers who have given this art 
its true place in the curriculum.”—H. B. Mapas. 
TuE subject of drawing from the teacher’s point of view resolves 
itself into two main branches—drawing by his pupils as a means 
of expression, and his own drawing before the class as a means of 
illustration. 
As regards the teaching of the subject, the existence of manuals 
of drawing, which every teacher should have, makes any instruc- 
tion on methods here, unnecessary. We need to see, however, “ 338 .
-P-A-G-E-352
The Teaching of Drawing 339 
how an intelligent application of drawing to the other subjects of 
the school course may be made to further the ends of education 
generally. 
We have learnt that education: to be successful must work 
in harmony with natural instincts and tendencies. Moreover, 
it must be constantly kept in touch with what the pupils see and 
hear going on around them and with what they feel. The desire 
to show by means of drawing what he has seen and thought about 
is an inborn instinct in man, and to it we owe, in large measure, 
our knowledge of the early history of the human race. Drawing 
came before writing as a means of expression, and in the picture 
records which were made before written ones may be read the © 
early story of man. These, scanty though they are, are valuable, 
and the more so from the fact that they were made from no other 
motive than that of forming a record of forms, facts, events and 
ideas. No desire to create a good impression falsifies them. While 
on one side these crude record drawings gave a later alphabet, 
on another they developed into ornamentation—patterns in bead 
work, and designs on wood, bone, and clay utensils, and on weapons 
and walls. : 
It is because man has always tried to express himself by this 
means that children should be taught to draw. Any instinct seen 
to be strong in the childhood of the race will be found to be strong 
likewise in. the childhood of the individual in any age. Proof 
that this one exists in the children we teach may be seen in their 
untaught efforts to express themselves in form, whether it be by 
moulding houses and castles in sand, by chalk drawings on wall 
and pavement, or by the hidden pencil sketches that enliven dull 
lessons. In older children this instinct seems to weaken. Why ? 
The answer is of great moment to all who teach. It is from want 
of exercise that arises from weakening of interest. Children are’ 
never interested. in drawing as a mere process; but at the outset 
they take to. it, because it is the only means at their command 
for showing their interest in things. When in our lessons we make 
too much of the way the drawing is to be done, our pupils are 
taken too far from the things drawn to remain interested. Failure 
to keep up their interest in things ; too early adoption of abstract 
methods of teaching; undue stress on the mere handwork and 
Processes of drawing—these are the causes of the weakening of 
children’s instinct for drawing. Through such mistaken methods
-P-A-G-E-353
340 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
we fail, with far-reaching results, to make use of their first strong 
impulse towards self-expression. 
To some extent, no doubt, at this later age expression by means 
of writing will have begun to take the place of drawing, but at 
every stage of their growth, our pupils should be able to draw well 
enough to express what they wish to express by that means. This 
for the reasons pointed out is not the case with the great majority 
of children. We see, therefore, the need for a rightly grounded 
and carefully graded course of training. Without such a course, 
a natural instinct, meant to be developed for use and enjoyment, 
tends to weaken and at last to die out. As teachers we are closely 
concerned with this matter. : 
The art instinct of children has a double value. It is, first, a 
means of expression, and secondly, an aid to memory. As a descrip- 
tion of any concrete thing, a truthful drawing is far more effective 
than any verbal effort can be. Themost exact language cannot com- 
pete with even a rough sketch that seems to put the thing itself 
before us. Similarly, if we wish to find out how far a child has 
profited by certain lessons—as, for example, on a railway system ; 
on the position of an army in battle; on the characteristic 
features of some plant or animal form—no answer in words is so 
satisfactory as the few lines of a simple drawing which put the 
matter beyond doubt. As an aid to memory it is valuable, be- 
cause the habit of forming picture records—as, for example, of a 
thing seen or of a road travelled—is the least laborious and the 
surest way of remembering. In some people the habit of visualising 
is natural. Where it is not, frequent practice in memory drawing, 
which shows the need for closer observation, is the best way of 
cultivating it. We may prove for ourselves in the classroom this 
second use of drawing. Verbal descriptions—as of the windings of 
a river, the features. of a building, or the details of historical cos- 
tumes—usually fail to impress themselves on the memory. If, 
however, instead of describing them in words we sketch on the 
blackboard the features we wish to impress, we shall find that 
our pupils are better able to remember them. The memory is 
more sure and full when the children themselves reproduce our 
sketches. 
Considering drawing, then, as a means of expression, we must 
realise that it needs cultivation in the same way as speaking and 
writing do. Before our pupils can express themselves well in any
-P-A-G-E-354

of these ways they must have clear and exact ideas. Incorrect 
mental images are fatal to clear thinking. The need of ensuring 
correct views of form from which they will obtain the ideas for later 
expression becomes, therefore, of first importance. While a child’s 
way of seeing, if he is untaught, is always right as far as it goes, he 
does not, in the absence of training, learn to observe more progres- 
sively. . : 
The first view of form is the object in mass, with outline, propor- 
tion and colour defined. Smaller details are observed later, per- 
spective later still, and light and shade, colour tints and texture 
last of all. 
From this we see the necessity for a graduated course to bring 
the child step by step to the power to express an object truly in 
detail. A graduated course of design lessons is also needed so that 
our pupils may be able to invent forms as well as to imitate them. By 
its means also they will have opportunity, through varied repetition, 
for the practice that develops dexterity without deadening interest. 
From the truth “ as with the race so with the individual ” comes 
the indication. of right method in teaching. In South Africa we 
have opportunities of studying the drawings of a very primitive 
people. The rock-paintings of Bushmen show us that the first 
subjects of expression are the objects of closest interest. As in the 
dawn of civilisation appetite made the strongest claim on the actions 
and ideas of men, the representations that have come down to us 
through the years are of the animals they hunted or pastured for 
food. The Bushman’s thoughts are plainly centred upon the things 
to be drawn, and not upon the drawing to be made. In this we have 
the key to all natural treatment of drawing. Had a Bushman been 
led to suppose that difficulties of a mechanical nature were to. be 
laboriously overcome, he would not have drawn. A like tale is 
told by the Kafir hunting story pictured on the bowl of a tobacco 
pipe? Both have the same message for us. The objects we pro- 
vide for children to draw must be such as interest them, being closely 
connected with their experience of nature and life. Another truth 
they teach is that the tool and the surface used in drawing will 
always affect to some extent the resulting picture, and must be 
taken into account when any drawing is required from children. 
Thus witha fihe point they will picture in outline, but with brush, 
crayon or chalk they can represent mass.

342 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
The old opinion, that only a few exceptionally gifted children 
can be taught to draw, must be given up by teachers of drawing. 
All we can say is that in drawing, as in other things, one child may 
do better than another. Moreover, just as in reading, writing and 
arithmetic the backward children can be helped to do better, so, in 
the case of drawing, every normal child may reach a fair level of 
attamment. It is strange that this was not realised earlier, for 
drawing bears such a close relation to writing, an art which the 
dullest pupils have been expected to master since the first estab- 
lishment of elementary schools. , 
The modern effort to bridge the gulf between lessons and life is 
furthered by a scheme of drawing which aims at developing the 
natural powers of eye and hand. Natural powers do not as a rule 
disclose themselves until called into use—“ the wider the range 
of early education, therefore, the more likely is it that a natural 
vocation will be followed in after life.” Drawing widens the scope 
of education. Success in many arts and crafts depends on such 
accurate observation and skilful execution as it cultivates. There 
are, therefore, great possibilities of its being the means of introducing 
pupils to careers of usefulness, in which they may excel through 
natural aptitude. 
‘The modern method of teaching drawing enjoins the early cor- 
relation of the subject with other school studies. It forbids the use 
of “ copies of objectless and meaningless forms,” on the ground that 
‘they make no appeal to the knowledge possessed by the pupil.” 
Moreover, however right a drawing of even a well-known natural 
form may be, if it is not made as a result of the child’s own observa- 
tions, it means nothing to him. Drawing taught and practised on 
the new lines enables the children to learn by doing. This is the 
way in which the human race has been educated from its earliest 
days. Man in his most primitive state felt a desire to express what 
he saw in Nature. His power to appreciate form, though limited 
at first, increased with every effort towards expression. So with 
the child to-day : every honest effort to see truthfully, accompanied 
by an effort to show faithfully, finds its reward in added power to 
do both. Under proper conditions of teaching, continuance in these 
two efforts will enable him at last to read and reproduce the charac- 
teristics of forms around him as easily as he can read and transcribe 
the written forms of words in books. 
As has been pointed out, the materials used in drawing influence

aE Aalst, 
ene, The Teaching of Drawing 343 
both the result and the method used to obtain it. The following 
methods are included in most modern schemes for the teaching of 
the subject. 
Free-arm drawing on large paper, wall or board surfaces is the 
most suitable exercise for young children when they first begin to 
draw. At the outset we do not want to force a child’s attention 
from things to drawings. It is therefore desirable to treat the actual 
drawing as freely as possible. Large scale of work, a soft material 
that enables an impression to be set down readily, and the knowledge 
that mistakes can be easily corrected—these are the chief advan- 
tages of blackboard drawing for the early stage of instruction. 
Freehand drawing is the natural development of Free-arm draw- 
ing as the children gain control over the finer muscles of the hand 
and fingers. It is suitable for desk-work. Coloured crayons and 
tinted paper should be used, and care should be given to the choice 
of colours. In this method of drawing a threefold aim should 
be pursued—training of the hand in making lines at various inclina~ 
tions; of the eye in judging simple distances ; and of the mind in 
determining quickly the characteristic forms of objects upon which 
recognition depends. In infant classes all drawings should be as 
large as possible, both for the reasons given above, and also because 
the larger the drawing the easier it is to detect and correct errors. 
The transition from chalk and crayon work to brush drawing 
gives opportunity for finer training of the children’s colour sense. 
At an early age they are only able to appreciate crude colours in 
large masses ; but, as they grow older, they may be led to see the 
beauty of softer tints and less harsh contrasts of colour. Both in 
dress and in house decoration there is evidence of want of colour- 
training ; and brush work offers an opportunity of supplying it. 
It should, of course, be based upon natural schemes of colouring, 
and may be brought into relation with nature work through lessons 
on the ‘rainbow and the spectrum. A colour wheel would be very 
useful at this stage for providing secondary colours through combi- 
nation, In its absence a home-made colour disc, spun on string, 
may be made to serve, and valuable training in, and exercises on, 
the matching and blending of colours may be given. From the 
third Standard year some mixing of colours by the children them- 
selves should be permitted as another experiment in obtaining 
secondary colours, and they should also make scales of colour to 
familiarise themselves with varying tones.
-P-A-G-E-357
344 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
In addition to the colour training it may afford, brush-drawing 
trains the children in the use of a finer “ instrument.” The-control 
of the flexible point of the brush makes for precision and dexterity. 
This formof drawing, too, like blackboard drawing, lends itself to 
the rapid recording of the general impression of a form while it 
is still strong. 
_ Until quite recently outline drawing of flat copies was the only 
sort of drawing exercise practised in elementary schools. Wiser 
counsels have resulted in the introduction of mass drawing and 
its use, particularly in the early stages, for the concentration of 
” attention on the actual bulk and shape of objects. Outline draw- 
ing tends to fix attention on the shape of the lines enclosing mass, 
and mass drawing is a good corrector of this tendency. Outline 
work, as the easiest mode of suggesting the shape of an object, has, 
of course, its value, and children turn to it instinctively when draw- 
ing with any sharp-pointed instrument. The gradual understand- 
ing of the nature of outline will come through the necessity of 
supplementing the rendering of masses. In the lower standards, 
where the children are only learning to write the alphabet of drawing, 
such lines as have occasionally to be used alone must always be 
moderately thick to express the mass of the object they represent. 
When teaching children how to draw objects which may be shown 
by the use of straight lines, we should choose such as may be 
represented by fairly thick lines, e.g. a toast-rack or a gridiron. 
Ruler drawing is closely associated both with practical arith- 
metic and with various branches of manual training. The drawing 
lesson proper, however, is the best time and place for ensuring 
correct method. The pupils must learn to measure objects accu- 
rately, and then to draw them, either actual size or accurately, 
according to some simple scale. 
Part of the purpose of ruler work is to give confidence to the 
pupils by letting them have mechanical aid in certain exercises 
before requiring entirely freehand work of them, and to prepare 
them for the scale drawing and geometrical drawing of the upper 
standards. The work must never be allowed to become merely 
mechanical—the objects chosen should be such as only allow of 
certain measurements being taken by ruler, leaving scope for free 
judgment of proportion and free drawing of curves in completing 
the exercises. 
The drawing of geometrical models is valuable as illustrating
-P-A-G-E-358
TN ae sok ab 
MC. The Teaching of Drawing 345 
the principles of construction and perspective. It is commonly 
deferred until the pupils have gained, through the examination of 
Many forms during the simple object-drawing of lower standards, 
the power to deal with constructed forms of a more elaborate nature. 
Where a school does not possess conventional models they may be 
made in cardboard. Rightly used, the models are useful, because 
they represent the simplest forms of certain typical constructions, 
and so can be made very helpful in suggesting the proper way of 
dealing with more complicated examples of such constructions. 
In addition to the geometrical models, sets of common objects should 
be used. . 
In considering the drawing of natural forms, it may be well to 
show how such drawing is complementary to that of manufactured 
objects which is carried on side by side with it. Each is a useful 
corrective to:certain tendencies developed by the other. Too rigid 
adherence to the drawing of things made with hands is apt to lead 
to a formal and mechanical treatment likely to destroy the feeling 
for natural form which it is one of the first aims of the training to 
cultivate. On the other hand, constant attention to natural forms 
which through their innumerable variations do not reveal any very 
apparent constructive plan to the eyes and minds of young children, 
tends to a certain looseness and inaccuracy of drawing. A child, 
for example, may make a drawing of a leaf that is a very fair repre- 
sentation of that type of leaf, although it is by no means a faithful 
showing of the particular specimen with which he was provided. 
From the point of view of training and the observation of principles, 
this is unsatisfactory ; and a corrective must be applied. The 
proportions of a simple artificial form are less subtle, and the reasons 
for such proportions are more apparent than in the case of natural 
forms. For this reason hand-constructed forms are taken first 
and are continued later side by side with natural ones. 
In infant classes drawing, whether of natural or artificial forms, 
is not regarded as a separate subject, but is used as a means of asso- 
ciating word and idea in connection with reading lessons, nature 
work, story and song. The printing of the name of the object 
beneath the drawing may, as time goes on, be made to lead up to 
formal lessons in writing. Throughout these lessons, the joy with 
which children made their earlier untutored efforts and regarded the 
results of them, must be preserved. 
In ‘the standards, the drawing of natural forms will serve to
-P-A-G-E-359
346 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
show the principles underlying beauty of form in nature. These 
principles should be taught gradually as successive examples 
bring them to the notice of the children. In such teaching the 
provision of specimens must be ample in order that the truths 
concerning them may be impressed upon the minds of the children. 
There should also be a constant reference to the mode of growth, 
The form that is studied in the classroom should, earlier, have been 
studied in its natural surroundings. Thus the drawing lesson will 
be closely linked up with the nature work of the school. 
Pattern drawing or design is directed towards showing that 
certain discovered arrangements of natural form are beautiful in 
themselves and are sources of beauty in art. The first exercises 
draw attention to the effect of repetition as a principle of beauty. 
Later exercises show that nature avoids the monotony that would 
come of unvaried repetition by resorting to alternation and group- 
series. 
As the pupils come to see that pattern drawing is in every 
detail closely related to nature, they learn to appreciate the prin- 
ciples upon which design is based. They find that it must be 
ruled by natural law and not by personal fancy. But this know- 
ledge should not bind them to slavish imitations; it is in the 
stimulation of invention and the cultivation of imaginative vision 
that part of the value of design work lies. The joy of it always 
rests to some extent on the freedom with which taste may be 
exercised in the arrangement of colour and form. The value of 
design in developing dexterity through repeated practice without 
deadening interest has already been pointed out. 
Memory drawing has certain well-defined uses which mark it 
off from other exercises. Its main purpose is to train the children 
to visualise form at will. It concentrates observation on what is 
essential to a truthful representation. A new lesson should, as a 
rule, open with a memory exercise which tests the children’s grasp 
of a previous one. Only a few minutes should be given for this, 
as the value of the work lies in the directness of thought and 
rapidity of expression it cultivates. 
From the foregoing principles and methods of practice we may 
summarise the aims of modern drawing. Briefly these are: to 
teach the pupils to see truthfully and show faithfully, thus giving 
them command of a graphic means of expression ; to lead them to 
appreciate beauty of form, arrangement, and colouring ; to train 
ee
-P-A-G-E-360
  The Teaching of Drawing 347 
them in manipulative skill and-dexterity, and ‘to cultivate imagi- 
nation and invention. 
We come now to a consideration of the value of drawing to 
teachers, as a means of illustration and in correlation with the 
other subjects of the school course. It is hardly too much to say 
that lack on a teacher’s part of this power of illustration robs his 
lessons of quite one-half of their effectiveness. A large part of 
the waste in teaching comes from the listlessness of the children ; 
and those who have watched a class quicken into interest as the 
teacher, chalk in hand, steps to the board with a “See, it is like 
this |” know for themselves one good way of stopping the leakage. 
Children learn best when they are seeing and when they are doing, 
and least when they are merely listening. One reason for this is 
that words depend for their meaning on the ideas associated with 
them, and that it frequently happens that words used in one sense 
by the teacher are understood in quite a different sense by the 
children, or cannot be understood by them at all because the 
underlying ideas are wanting. It can easily be seen how such a 
misunderstanding at the beginning of a lesson will, during its 
course, lead the children so far astray from the path of our thought 
that understanding becomes impossible and listening sinks into 
listlessness. Of course, when it is said that children learn only 
when they are seeing and when they are doing it is borne in mind 
that there is a mental vision and a mental activity, as well as that 
concerned with the eye and hand. But children must perceive 
through their senses before they can see with their minds, and of 
the gateways of knowledge the eye is the broadest and the oftenest 
used. The mental images called up by words are often blurred 
and indistinct ; they are often, as we have seen, also “untrue” 
in some particular ; and much confusion results which can only 
be cleared by illustration. To illustrate a subject, a lesson, or one’s 
meaning is to throw light upon it; and by far the best and 
readiest way of doing so is the use of graphic means. If a teacher 
has the power to show vividly the image which is present in his 
mind and which he wishes to raise in the minds of his pupils, no 
confusion can possibly result. The usefulness of drawing in this 
connection is only limited by the capacity of the teacher. 
In ‘blackboard illustration, even to a greater degree than in 
any-other drawing, the mind should be concerned with the idea 
to be expressed—not with the drawing as a drawing. It is the
-P-A-G-E-361
348 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
teacher’s power of conveying information by means of drawing 
that is in question here, not his power of draughtsmanship except 
in so far as the latter is an aid to the former. As in other memory 
drawing, rapidity of execution is important. There is not time 
during any lesson for fine, detailed work that takes long to do. 
Boldness and simplicity are, in addition, aids to clear expression. 
We must be sparing with our lines; the fewer used to convey an 
idea, the more forceful will be its representation. Whenever pos- 
sible,.we must make use of mass colouring ; it is easier than out- 
line, more’ striking, truer. The wording which accompanies a 
blackboard sketch should be clear and well-formed. Verbal and 
graphic illustration then unite to give the strongest possible im- 
pression, and the blackboard scheme, left exposed, will quietly 
continue to instruct when the lesson is over. 
By reason of its illustrative value, drawing bears an intimate 
relation to all the subjects of the school course. It is, indeed, an 
indispensable aid to the successful teaching of most of them. At 
the very beginning of school life it is needed to aid in the associa- 
tion of word and idea. Its use not only serves to make meaning 
clearer but adds life and interest to all lessons which aim at the 
cultivation of speech and reading power. Little children who are 
incapable of abstract thought are stimulated to one observation 
after another by a bold sketch in colour, while their own subsequent 
efforts to show by chalk drawings some of the things they have 
talked of help them further forward. Story and song can be in- 
vested with more living interest by the same treatment. The 
approach to formal writing lessons must be made by way of 
drawing. Before children have developed the fine muscle-power 
which enables them to control a pencil, they should be taught to 
draw the printed forms of letters in fine sand, using pointed sticks 
for the. purpose, while al] their drawing at this stage is an 
aid to the later forming of script letters in which curves and 
straight lines are combined. ‘The practical arithmetic demanded 
at the present day requires, on the part of both teachers and 
children, command of graphic means of expression. Measurements 
have to be taken and recorded, diagrams drawn to represent frac- 
tional parts, and graphs made for all sorts of purposes. In all 
this work the training in ruler drawing will be found a powerful aid 
in securing readiness, neatness, and accurateness of expression. 
Drawing may be made to lend aid also in composition lessons. A

new interest is added to these, in the children’s minds, when they 
are called upon either to illustrate their compositions, or to. write 
on the subject of some effective and suggestive sketch. Graphic 
and verbal expression are so closely allied that stimulation by the 
one. meets with ready response in the freer flow of the other. 
Blackboard sketches of familiar things. make the right approach 
to those compositions on pictures which many teachers have found 
to yield happy results. In later grammar lessons, again, we may 
make use of drawing as a means, the only one except actual de- 
monstration, of illustrating the commoner errors in grammatical 
construction. From the very outset drawing is necessary to the 
teaching of geography. Children must draw a plan of the school- 
room and be made familiar with a plan of the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of the school. They need,to be taught in an introductory 
lesson to distinguish between a plan and a picture, and no wordy 
explanation will make the difference so sharp and clear in their 
minds as will the drawing on a horizontal board of the plans of a 
few familiar objects of simple form and the contrasting of these 
with pictures of them rapidly sketched on another board placed 
vertically. Again, before they can make intelligent use of a map 
the children must reduce to scale some real piece of country—play- 
ground, garden, or field—and represent it and its features by a 
drawing. 
Tn later geography, whatever branches may be the subject of 
study, the need for the use of drawing for purposes of illustration is 
so great that it has become an essential part of the teaching. For 
drawing in geography is no longer confined to the making of maps. 
Any sketches—as, for instance, of plants and animals, of character- 
istic race features of the inhabitants of other lands, of their dress, 
their tools and weapons, of buildings and of séenes—which may help 
the children to realise the conditions of life in far countries will be a 
means of increasing interest. If the children are accustomed to 
make written notes only on the right-hand pages of their notebooks, 
and are encouraged to fill those on the left hand with sketches of 
the sort suggested, to supplement the information given by their 
maps, the making of them during home-study will vary reading and 
memory work agreeably and usefully. 
In the same way the history lesson offers opportunity for inter- 
esting and educative illustrative drawing. Drawings that show sites 
and buildings of armies in battle,and maps to show conquestand ex-
-P-A-G-E-363
350 The School; the Child, and the Teacher 
ploration—old maps as wellasmodern ones—drawings of theweapons 
and costumes of various ages, are fitting objects for graphic expres- 
sion. For the history of South Africa, reproductions of Bushman 
paintings, of distinctive headgear and dress worn by different native 
tribes, of early forts and other defences, suggest themselves as 
specially suitable. Without this illustrative work, history teaching 
can never be what it should be. 
When we come to the consideration of nature-study in connection 
with drawing, we quickly realise that the relation between the two 
is so close that it is almost impossible to regard them as independent 
subjects. The nature student who has not the power to make 
records of his discoveries by drawings, loses half.the value of his 
study. There is no branch of the work that does not call for it, and 
it is even more necessary to the teacher than to the student. Draw- 
ing, on the other hand, owes much to the study of natural forms, for 
it is from these that-the draughtsman gains his knowledge of those 
principles of beauty in nature on which all right art-work is founded. 
The two subjects are thus seen to be mutually helpful ; and to at- 
tempt to teach the one independently of the other is to lose the full 
value of both. Drawing is not less essential in all educational 
handwork. It is, indeed, the foundation of all branches of manual 
training. It must lead up to and accompany them all; is equally 
important to the woodworker in all his planning and to the needle- 
woman as the basis of all her work in design. 
Some of us, perhaps, hesitate to draw for illustration on account 
of the defectiveness of our work. We should conquer this feeling. 
The children will be too much taken up with the idea expressed to 
criticise the drawing, and will be far more benefited by the at- 
tempt, than harmed by its failure to reach a high standard of artistic 
excellence. Many teachers and lecturers illustrate admirably just 
through having in the beginning ignored the fact that they were 
unable to draw well. Ease and improvement follow upon use. The 
fact to be grasped and acted upon at the outset is the fact that lines 
can be made to express ideas.

CHAPTER XV 
EDUCATIONAL HANDWORK 
«© Educational handwork trains both on its intellectual and on its moral side 
what we may best describe as the practical capacity, the power of adjusting 
means to ends.”—H. THISELTON MARK. 
“Not one of the child’s school lessons brings him nearer to reality, and 
hence nearer to a true interest, than his manual training lesson ; nor is there 
any better means of realising Herbart’s great idea of an esthetic revelation of 
the world.”—H. W. SmirH. 
Tur provision made for the teaching of various branches of educa- 
tional handwork in public elementary schools may be looked upon 
as a response to the demand, made frequently during the last fifty 
years, that school work should be more practical in its nature. 
This view, however, fails to appreciate the full purpose of the 
training ; for, though a preparation for the activities of life is a 
part of the aim of manual training, it is its educational value no less 
than its practical usefulness which has led to its being included 
among school subjects. 
There is no need to decide which is the more important aspect 
of handwork—the educational. or the practical. The training of 
hand and eye which shows in ability to cut cloth, or carve wood, or 
shape metals as the need or wish arises, is of value in later life. “On 
the other hand, manual training so strengthens and develops intelli- 
gence and character that, were there no practical purpose served by 
cultivating it, every wise scheme of education would provide for 
doing so. 
The educational value of handwork for Sub-Standard classes has 
long been recognised, and manual occupations are provided for 
infants as the best means of cultivating both muscular control and: 
mind power. In senior classes, again, the practical usefulness of 
such training has made a place for it in elementary courses—wood- 
work or metal work being prescribed for boys ; and—in addition to 
352
-P-A-G-E-366
4 
j Educational Handwork 353 
needlework—cookery or laundry work for girls. But in the junior 
school there has been little provision made against a need that is 
greater from eight to twelve years of age than at any other time. 
Apart from needlework and drawing junior scholars have too fre- 
quently had no means of exercising in school those muscular powers 
which, trained to some extent in the infant room, have been devel- 
oping with their growth, and demand further employment. The 
provision of such employment by a graduated scheme that takes 
account of this need, and sets suitable exercises for all classes from 
the sub-standards to the highest, is a reform that may be expected 
now that the educational value of handwork is coming to be more 
generally appreciated. While difficult exercises in wood and metal 
are beyond the powers of boys, and the more advanced cookery and 
laundry practice unsuitable for girls, in the middle years of school 
life, constructive work in paper and cardboard would give the 
necessary training to the one, while there are various forms of 
housewifery which might be adapted to the needs of the other. 
These, with the care of pets and the gardening operations which 
nature study opens to both, would meet the case. 
For the youngest children manual occupation must be some 
form of play-work which does not task too heavily their undeveloped 
powers. While the use of the kindergarten “ Gifts” at once 
suggests itself, some of these are not suited for school use even 
in the lowest classes. Froebel, in inventing his occupations, was 
providing for the needs of children from the very early stages of 
infancy, and the elementary ideas that some of the “ Gifts” were 
designed to convey have been grasped by most children before they 
enteran infant school. Some of the later “ Gifts,” again, provide 
material, the use of which requires adjustments of small muscles 
which are not under the control of children of four and five years 
ofage. As we watch their fumbling efforts to pick up and lay down 
again in particular positions the fine sticks of Gift VIII, we realise 
that for these there should be substituted something which will 
give the same training without causing too much strain—wooden 
bricks, laths or slabs, for instance, of a size which small fingers can: 
easily manipulate. We must consider the use of the “ Gifts,” as 
of any other apparatus, in a common-sense way. We must not think 
it necessary to adopt all or any one particular “ Gift” simply be- 
cause Froebel invented an occupation with it and modern infant; 
teaching is expected to follow the lines laid down by him for the

education of little children.. What is necessary is that we try to 
discover the truths about child nature which underlie his system, 
and then see how we may best act in accordance with these truths, 
whether by using his prescribed apparatus or not. Very often this - 
will need adapting to suit special circumstances. Sometimes it will 
have to be rejected altogether. 
If the materials chosen are such as can be dyed, or painted in 
several bright colours, they may be used in colour-training. This 
change of use is very desirable; for apparatus which cannot be 
made to serve more than one purpose makes for monotony, and this 
must, at all costs, be avoided in the teaching of young children. 
Children seem to take a special delight in using things for pur- 
poses quite different from those which they were designed to serve. 
They then become real toys, which may be used for one end 
or another as fancy dictates, If we can design toys which will serve 
equally for games of building or for exercises in colour, orfor counting, 
or for other employments, we shall be acting in the way in which 
the child naturally behaves. Whatever special use we may make 
of such simple apparatus,we must always find timeat certain periods 
of the day for the children to do just what they like with it. From 
their spontaneous games and amusements we shall learn much as° — 
to what they like. We need opportunities for learning from our 
pupils as well as for teaching them.” (J. Gunn, The Infant School.) 
But, while on the one hand there should be variety in the use 
of one form of apparatus, there should also be different kinds ; for 
“ something new” is the constant demand of child nature. Uni- 
formity, formality, monotony, the repetition to-day of what was 
done or shown yesterday, is weariness and futility in the infant room. 
And variety of apparatus is not hard to obtain. Shells, coloured 
cardboard shapes or cotton reels, coins, large beads, and beans— 
all these and many others can be made to delight the children while 
serving our purpose. Although simple apparatus can be cheaply 
bought nowadays, a glance through an illustrated catalogue will 
often prove so suggestive that we shall need to make little or no 
outlay of money. As a general rule we make the best—that is, the 
most educative—use of apparatus which we obtain or design by our 
own efforts. The value of sand and clay in providing play-work for 
very young children must not be overlooked. 
After this first stage the children should pass from occupations  
-P-A-G-E-368
Educational Handwork . 355 
of the purely play type to others which are more formally educative 
——to the constructing, arranging, or working of decorative or useful 
schemes of form and colour, such as paper-folding, mat-weaving, 
bead-threading, and embroidering in outline. Clay, or some other 
plastic material for moulding, and prepared wall-surfaces and chalk 
for drawing should now take the place of the more easily manipu- 
lated sand. Free exercise with the material should still be allowed, 
that thé inventive powers of the children may have scope and their 
minds have freedom to develop according to their native endow- 
ments. From this stage in choosing occupations we must ask our- 
selves not only whether they are suited to the present age of our 
pupils, but whether they will admit of development in later years. 
Modelling and drawing easily pass the double test, for while they 
give delight and train expressive skill in the youngest children, they 
are capable of being developed, as power increases, through all the 
school standards and beyond them. Paper-folding, again, is a good 
preparation for later paper-cutting and cardboard-modelling, and 
the folding of materials for needlework, Mat-weaving leads on to 
cane-weaving, and embroidery to needlework. No rule, however, 
can be given that will serve at all stages as a test for admitting or 
excluding individual exercises ; .but this general guiding principle 
aust be borne in mind—“ that no occupation is of much educational 
value unless it leads somewhere or has the germ of growth within 
it.” This remembered, the individual teacher is the best judge 
of the individual exercise ; for she alone knows what she can develop 
from it. 
When the second year is reached it will be advisable to concen- 
trate on fewer occupations ; for greater skill and accuracy are 
required as the approach to the standards is made.. Modelling and 
drawing,.as the most educative of employments and the most suited 
for expressional work, must be continued. In addition, paper- 
cutting, for its training in the use of edged tools, and for its relation 
to later constructive work in paper or cardboard, and cane-weaving 
for its admirable effect in developing dexterity of finger-movement, 
and for its usefulness, are also suitable. Needlework, as a distinc- 
tive occupation for girls, begins in this class with needle, thimble, 
position and knitting drills, and hemming and knitting stitches. 
With regard to the latter it must be seen that the materials and the 
stitches in hemming are of a texture and size that remove all fear 
of eyestrain. In all sub-standard classes—and, indeed, through-

out the school, but particularly up to, and including, Standard IV 
~—the care.of pets and. the tending, under supervision, of flower- 
beds or of seeds and seedlings grown indoors should be con- 
tinued. 
Standard I may suitably continue the occupations of the sub- 
standards, Such development as is found to be possible should 
be in the direction of constructive work in paper and cardboard 
Drawing and needlework should be continued progressively: 
* ~ It is possible that owing to the greater amount of formal work 
to be accomplished in Standard II and upwards, a need to drop 
all occupations but drawing and neeedlework will be felt; but 
this would rob the children almost entirely of a most educa- 
tive form of work at a time when nature is urging them to- 
waids the accomplishment of material and practical results. At 
all-costs the endeavour must be made to find time for occupations 
which will suitably bridge the gulf between those of the infant room 
and those of the highest standards. For both boys and girls they 
may take the form of exercises.in paper-cutting and cardboard- 
modelling. The last is one of the cheapest forms of educational 
handwork, few tools being required, and the materials costing little, 
As regards difficulty, it stands between the easier modelling of 
plastic materials suited to infant classes, and the harder carving in 
wood which employs boys from the fifth standard up. Further, 
it can be carried out at the ordinary school desks on a piece of board 
supplied for the purpose. Except in the case of a few of the strong- 
est models, which will require glue, paste should be used. A special 
table with a rough surface should be provided for the paste-pot or 
glue-pot, and most of the fixing should be done at it. Each child 
should have a large envelope in which to keep unfinished work. 
‘The envelopes should be: kept by the teacher in a general locker, 
should be distributed at the beginning, and collected at the end of 
each lesson. 
_./'In order: that. the work may have its full educative value, 
neatness and careful adjustment must be required in all exercises, 
while decorative treatment should be introduced to give play 
to the artistic instincts, and scope be allowed for invention. 
The exercises may pass from simple geometrical forms in the 
flat, through ‘solid geometrical forms (open, as, for example, pin- 
or pencil-trays, pen-racks, wall-boxes ; and closed, as, for example, 
-the square pyramid and prism) to more advanced work in the
-P-A-G-E-370
Educational Handwork::- 357 
making of such articles as standing photo-frames, watch-stands, 
pipe-racks, letter-cases, wall- -pockets, etc. 
From some of these exercises the girls might be withdrawn for 
special instruction, where provision can be made for it, in simple 
forms of housewifery as, for example, the washing of dishes ; the 
sweeping and dusting of a room ; bed-making and the preparation 
of clothes for the laundry classes by separating woollens from 
cottons and coloured articles from white ones; the peeling of 
potatoesand paring and coring of fruit for cooking 5. the testing 
of eggs and milk, etc. 
For the upper standards a course in woodwork or metal work 
is usually prescribed for boys. and one in needlework, or, where 
housewifery centres or other facilities exist, in cooking or laundry 
work for girls: As woodwork and needlework are the: two crafts 
most generally taught, a few words, on the principles and purposes 
underlying their teaching will be in place here. 
I. WoopworKk 
We may glance first at some of the facts which have given to 
this form of handicraft its place of importance - among manual 
occupations for boys. 
With regard to the advantages to be claimed for woodwork, 
the Editor of Manual Training expresses himself as follows in 
Chapter XII of The Primary Curriculum : 
“Wood is clean and easy to work; cheap and convenient to 
buy ; lends itself to infinite variations of form, and,. to. a lesser 
degree, of colour ; brings us, perhaps, into closer touch with nature 
than any other material ; and can be made the basis for the greater 
part of geometrical science, and for a large part of art culture. 
“Wood comes into the manual training room in a less prepared 
state than metal or cardboard, and needs throughout a greater 
number of tools for its manipulation. It lends itself. to all re- 
quirements of the constructive faculty. It is a material of three 
dimensions, but is within rather more severe limits of manipulation 
than is metal, owing to its fibrous structure.” 
Reasons underlying the choice of this form of ‘handicraft are 
to be found, then, in its economy; in the opportunity it provides for 
the gaining of direct knowledge of nature and of one of the most 
useful sciences; in the scope it offers for muscular, and, through
-P-A-G-E-371
358 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
that, for mind and character-training ; in its lending itself so readily 
to the construction of articles of practical usefulness ; and in its 
conferring the power to continue this productiveness. 
But these advantages of course cannot be enjoyed by the 
pupils unless the teaching of the subject fulfils certain conditions. 
Important among these conditions are the fitting of the work- 
room and the care of material and tools. There should be for each 
scholar at least four feet of bench space and two feet to allow of 
freedom of movement in front of the bench. ‘The necessary bench 
‘tools should be supplied to each scholar, and a proper place in 
which to keep them provided. Additional tools that will be re- 
quired by the pupils from time to time should have a place given 
‘them within reach of all. 
Attention should be drawn to the nature of the tools and the 
proper ways of using them should be taught. In classes for older 
boys demonstrations to illustrate the correct way of sharpening 
edged tools and keeping them in order should be given, while in 
the highest class the boys themselves should be entrusted with 
the task of keeping them ground and sharpened. 
The teaching should include lessons on various kinds of hard 
and soft woods ; and care should be given to seeing that the pupils 
know the various parts of the trees producing them and the con- 
ditions affecting their growth. Where native woods are used it 
is desirable that the boys should be familiar with them in their 
natural and living state, and be able to tell, broadly at least, the 
conditions as to site, moisture, etc., that they require and the 
localities which supply these. The processes of felling, lumbering, 
sawing and seasoning should be taught in such detail as is found 
to be practicable ; and some instruction should be given on the 
chief commercial woods—their habitat and mode of growth. 
Markings and grainings should be studied in the specimens in use, 
and common flaws should be shown and commented on. In dis- 
tinguishing the harder and softer woods their respective uses 
should be told and the difference between heart-wood and sap- 
wood pointed out. Visits to local plantations of the Forest Depart- 
ment should be made where possible, that the pupils may have 
opportunity of studying a variety of trees undergoing cultivation. 
Tree-planting by the pupils themselves should be carried out where 
practicable. 
Discipline in the workshop must needs differ in some respects
-P-A-G-E-372
Educational Handwork © 359 
from that of the classroom, though there, as elsewhere, if the 
pupils are furthering their own work without interfering with 
that of anyone else, the class is well-disciplined. The boys must 
be able to obtain tools and material, make comparisons with a 
model, or consult a fellow-worker. The teacher must feel that he 
has them all in hand, or, what is better in the case of older scholars, 
that they have themselves in hand ; but an atmosphere favourable 
to work can be maintained without any of the oppressiveness of 
rigid discipline. 
Orderliness in management of bench and tools during work, 
and in the replacing of the latter when work is done, is, however, 
an essential part of workshop discipline. To keep things “ ship- 
shape,” should be the aim of each boy. Thege is no better way 
than “the way they have in the navy,” for maintaining this 
necessary order, and it is one that’ boys can emulate without any 
feeling of effeminacy. A neat bench with all tools and materials in 
place should be required of every pupil at the close of the work- 
eriod. 
P Like every other subject of school-instruction, this form of 
handicraft lends itself to correlation. With arithmetic and 
geometry it is so closely associated as to seem only a practical appli- 
cation of part of their teaching. Whenever reference is made, as it 
must often be made, to the wood in its tree life, it merges into 
nature study, while the processes by which it is prepared for 
commerce and its trade use bring it into touch with geography. 
When the woodwork instructor is also the class teacher, such oppor- 
tunities as the class lessons afford for broadening the bases of the 
subject, should always be seized in the interests of intelligent work. 
II. NEEDLEWORK 
The existence of many good text-books on needlework and of 
special pamphlets and notes concerning the teaching of the subject 
makes it unnecessary to consider here the matter and method of 
individual lessons. But, since the aim and general principles 
guiding successful teaching must be mastered by all teachers during 
training, these two points come within the scope of this book. 
_ “The aim is to fit girls for what Herbert Spencer calls the 
‘activities of life’ The natural future of girls is marriage. The
-P-A-G-E-373
360 ‘The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
house-mother should be able to make her own and her children’s 
clothes, knit her husband’s socks and darn the stockings of the house- 
hold. She should be able to exercise ingenuity in making the most 
-of the material she is cutting out, in adapting old clothes, in patch- 
ing, mending and fitting. Moreover, she must be able to do all 
these things. easily and quickly, so that they do not become too 
great a burden. She should exercise good taste in her purchases.” 
(Transvaal Education Department’s Regulations for Primary Schools.) 
_ While bearing in mind this ultimate aim of practical usefulness 
-in after life, teachers must so arrange the course of needlework 
‘lessons that it is suited to girls varying in age from six to sixteen. 
It must, in its beginnings, put no undue strain on the youngest 
‘pupils, and must bé@ graduated in difficulty throughout, so that at 
each stage the girls find in it full employment for their powers. As 
a form of educational handwork, it must aid in developing these 
powers. 
Girls under six years of age should not be taught to sew. The 
delicate finger-work required even for stitches of fair size is too great 
a tax on the undeveloped muscles of their small hands, while many 
medical men are convinced that needlework cannot be undertaken 
at this age without risk of injury to the eyesight.1 Training in 
free-arm and free-hand movements will, however, be found useful 
about, this time. The needle, thimble, position and knitting-pin 
drills prescribed for Sub-Standard classes provide such training. 
The practice of knitting with coarse wool on pins of a moderate 
thickness, does not entail the risk mentioned in the case of sewing, 
and the proper manipulation of knitting pins and wool—a matter 
requiring much practice before ease and speed can be combined 
with correct holding and moving—affords muscle-movement ad- 
mirably suited to the powers and needs of girls just passing out of 
infancy. . 
At all stages of the work very fine stitches on very fine material 
will tend, under certain conditions, to cause a strain on the eyes ; 
but no’strain need result if the eyesight is normal when these con- 
ditions are avoided. The first of them is poor or ill-directed light ; 
a second, too long continuance of such sewing at a time; a third, 
wrong methods of working and work holding. As for all other 
occupations demanding close use of the eyes, the light must be 
1 Children with weak eyesight require special consideration and special 
care in teaching. In some cases they should be excused altogether.
-P-A-G-E-374
Educational Handwork 361 
sufficient without being too strong, and should fall from the left rear 
—over the left shoulder—of the worker, not from the front. As 
regards position, the work must be held up, but not too closely, to 
the eyes: a distance of from about nine to twelve inches is right. 
The head must not be allowed to droop over the work. As regards 
the method of working, in fine materials the counting of threads must 
not be practised. This may be necessary when a stitch is first 
being learnt on canvas or some other coarse material, but must be 
given up as soon as it is mastered and is being used on fine material. 
Not only is it injurious to eyesight, but it is a practice altogether 
faulty from the point of view of hand and eye training: 
Care must be given to seeing that the girls handle their work 
properly. Materials must be held lightly, and the fingers of the 
right hand must not be closed tightly over the needle and cotton. 
The cotton must not be grasped in the fingers, but left hanging loose. 
It should be seen that the girls do not take more than eighteen 
inches of cotton. In the lowest classes twelve will be long enough. 
The pupils should be warned not to sew with dirty cotton ; but, if 
they need to be constantly changing it, the reason should be 
found. — 
There is, perhaps, no other subject which shows so clearly as 
needlework does the effect of early training, and none which offers 
better opportunities for influencing character. If we let these pass, 
and give all our thoughts to getting good stitches, part of thepurpose 
of. our needlework teaching will be unfulfilled. Before giving a 
lesson to junior pupils we should make a point of seeing that they 
have made proper preparation for it—that their hands are clean, 
‘especially the nails ; that their frocks are clean and, if dark coloured, 
covered by a sewing apron or sewing bag; that their hair is tied back 
| so that it cannot fall forward over their work ; and that they have 
brought their thimbles. In the case of senior girls, training should 
4 have done its work in these respects ; but we must of course know, 
though a formal inspection should be unnecessary, if a girl has been 
neglectful in any one of these particulars. Our teaching should 
* have further influence on character, through an aim to check ex- 
travagance, encourage economy, and develop forethought. 
Every possible effort should be made to render the class teaching 
attractive and to awaken in the girls an enthusiasm for that side of 
homework which is shown in the skill of an expert needlewoman. 
The interest. of girls in dress may be used for this purpose, for the  
-P-A-G-E-375
362 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
connection between the art of dress and the art of needlework is 
very close, and the two should develop together. As constant work 
on specimens and garments that take a long time to finish may damp 
the ardour of young needlewomen, we should encourage our pupils 
to apply what they learn in school to the making of their dolls’ 
clothes at home. From time to time we might appoint an afternoon 
for these to be brought to school to be examined and criticised. 
Enthusiasm can also be aroused by the dressing in class of a doll or 
dolls to be sent to the children’s ward of some local hospital. The 
plan has the further advantage of cultivating an attitude of thought- 
ful kindness towards less favoured children. Where the school 
itself draws its pupils from a very poor neighbourhood, the desti- 
nation of the dolls dressed in class might be the school Christmas 
tree. Permission to work on one of the garments during a certain 
period of the afternoon’s lesson might be given as a reward for 
specially good work. By this plan the girls may finish a number 
of garments that should be similar to their inspection ones in every 
point but size, and they will benefit by the extra practice and 
experience. 
It is possible for teachers of upper standard classes to influence 
their pupils in matters of dress and taste during the time given to 
needlework—to discourage the wearing of “ fine ” materials of poor 
quality, and to encourage a style of dress which is simple, neat and 
fresh, and (a point often overlooked) suited to the wearer’s occupa- 
tion, The cutting-out lessons will yield opportunity for awakening 
an appreciation of the natural lines of the human figure, which 
appreciation, if more generally felt, would go far to correct errors of 
tight clothing. While ready-cut paper patterns for home use are 
easily procurable nowadays, school training is needed to show the 
reason for each straight line and curve, and to teach the various 
devices for fitting garments to the figure in such a way that move- 
ment may be frée. The instruction should also enable the pupils to 
adapt a bought pattern to an individual figure. Lessons on colours 
and materials are also desirable. While art needlework is not pro- 
vided for in the code, it might be made, in the case of certain scholars 
who have fulfilled the code requirements, a further means of culti- 
vating the sense of beauty in form and colour. Their design work 
in drawing would thus be put to practical use. 
When our pupils are able to work for part of an afternoon with 
little verbal instruction, the reading aloud of a good story or poem
-P-A-G-E-376

by a girl who can read distinctly, pleasantly and fluently, might be 
permitted.

CHAPTER XVI 
PHYSICAL EDUCATION 
“ A sound mind in a sound body is a. short but full description of a happy 
state in this world. He-that has these two has little more to wish for, and he 
that wants either of them will be but little the better for anything etse.” 
. so . Hoe —Locke. 
‘Tuere is no need at the present day to insist upon the im- 
portance of giving a certain amount of definite physical training 
to school children. What is more necessary is, that we should 
remember that such exercises are only one aspect of physical edu- 
‘cation, Favourable conditions of ventilation, of lighting, of class- 
room and schoolroom accommodation, must also be regarded as 
essential. Moreover, we must recognise that a strict supervision 
of posture during reading and writing, as well as an arrangement 
of lessons that provides change from headwork to handwork and 
from work to recreation, has an important effect on bodily health. 
For the moment the training of mind and character is not our 
chief concern’; but we must not lose’sight of the closeness of the 
relation between body, mind and character. When it is more 
generally realised to what an extent mind and conduct are reacted 
upon by the body,.it will be seen how powerful a weapon physical 
health is in the battle of life. 
From this it follows, as a matter of course, that every teacher 
should receive such training in the best methods of physical cul- 
ture as will enable him to know the value, from a health point of 
‘view, of every exercise he gives his’ pupils. The value of drill as 
an aid to discipline is without doubt great, and well-performed 
physical exercises make an attractive display ; but their effects on 
bodily health are more important, and these should be kept in 
view: when. schemes are planned.. No. exercise is valuable.in this 
sense unless it has some definite beneficial effect on the body, and 
364
-P-A-G-E-378
Physical Education 365 
no teacher is competent as an instructor in physical drill who is 
unable to judge of such effect. 
‘With regard to the effect of school routine on physical health, a 
word or two may be necessary. The body cannot carry out pro- 
perly certain of its functions if it is not active; and any school 
system which requires children to restrain their bodily. activities 
through the whole of a session, and allows them to assume cramped 
positions over their work, is warring against that health which it 
tries to promote by its organised physical exercises. 
There is another drawback to be reckoned with, and one , which 
it is less in our power to control. This is the evil effect of bad 
home conditions with regard to air, cleanliness, food and rest. 
Even here, however, as we have seen in an earlier chapter, we must 
do -what we can by action and influence to remove or improve 
conditions which interfere with bodily well-being. 
At this point it may be well to reconsider what are the condi- 
tions of health. The first is a sufficient and constantly renewed 
supply of fresh air to act, together with personal cleanliness, in 
purifying the system from the effects of its waste products ; the 
second is a sufficiency of wholesome food to repair waste and build 
up the body; the third, a sufficiency of rest and sleep to repair 
mental waste and restore the powers of the mind. These may 
be looked on as the underlying conditions of physical health and 
growth; but there is something further needed before they can 
have their due effect in producing it—namely, exercise. For 
““ development is produced by exercise. . . . If we wish to develop 
the hand we must exercise the hand. If we wish to develop 
the body we must exercise the body. If we wish to develop the 
mind we must exercise the mind. If we wish to develop the whole 
human being we must exercise the whole human being.” (Bowen’s 
Froebel, Great Educator Series, p. 48.) 
In a country like South Africa, where fresh air is easily obtain- 
able even in our largest towns, the first necessity at all events, 
is within reach of all. Yet we know that in many small and 
over-crowded homes the children suffer from a want of it at night, 
when, of all times, it is most necessary. A sensitiveness to cold, 
which unhealthy habits of living have caused, or perhaps the 
desire for greater safety, results in the fast-closing of all windows 
at nightfall ; and the children in consequence sleep too heavily, 
and rise unrefreshed: Something may be done in this matter by
-P-A-G-E-379
366 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
so accustoming the children to deep breathing of fresh air in 
well-ventilated classrooms—which happily are the rule rather than 
the exception nowadays—that their need of it becomes so insis- 
tent as to bring about a change in home conditions. The desire 
for cleanliness is also largely a result of habit. If personal cleanli- 
ness is insisted on in school—and, thanks to the modern provision 
of lavatories, it can be insisted on—the children will soon come to 
recognise the greater comfort arising from it, and will strive after it 
even in adverse circumstances at home. Direct instructions, given in 
occasional hygiene lessons, on these two points will also be necessary.’ 
With regard to food, we know, of course, that mere sufficiency 
is not enough. It must be wholesome and varied as regards the 
food elements it contains, in order that the different tissues of the 
body may receive nourishment. To yield full benefit to body and 
brain, it must be well cooked and well served. We know that in 
many homes ignorance and poverty render this impossible. Some- 
thing may here be done by teaching domestic science to girls from 
homes of this class. But such teaching, if it is to have any effect, 
must take account of the conditions under which the girls will have 
to manage homes in the future. The provision for school classes of 
all manner of cooking apparatus and expensive foodstuffs, which 
the pupils will be unable to afford, will be likely to act as a dis- 
‘couragement when they find themselves face to face with the 
problem of providing meals for a family on a strictly limited in- 
come, With suitable and general instruction in home science in 
this generation, we may hope for the partial removal in the next 
of the physical harm resulting from unsuitable and ill-cooked food. 
In the meantime, since it is as hopeless to attempt to work un- 
nourished bodies and minds as to drive an engine without fuel, 
some provision may have to be made by school, church, or town 
authorities for the proper feeding of poor children; 
The necessity of rest in sleep must also be taught in hygiene 
lessons ; and the fact should be emphasized that not only the 
amount of sleep, but the nature of it and the time at which it 
is obtained are important. Young children should have not less 
than eight hours’ sleep, and of this amount at least three hours 
should be obtained before midnight. To be refreshing, sleep must 
be light and unlaboured ; and this it cannot be unless the air of 
the bedroom is kept pure by the continuous passing of heated and 
impure air from inside through openings near the ceiling, and the
-P-A-G-E-380

incoming of cool fresh air through openings near the floor. A 
window open a few inches at top and bottom, if there is a door 
or chimney opposite with a ventilator above it to draw the air 
through the room, will provide the necessary means of escape and 
renewal ; and it should not be difficult to devise some means of 
fastening the sash to the frame so that safety from intrusion may 
be enjoyed with healthful conditions. 
We come now to the question of proper exercise. Any form 
of exercise given under any conditions will not serve to promote 
health, but only that which is suited to the nature of the part 
being exercised, related to its strength at the child’s stage of 
development and given at the right time under proper conditions. 
It is absolutely essential for the planning and supervision of 
such exercise that we have some knowledge, gained from a simple 
textbook or reader, of the build of the body, and of its processes 
and mode of growth. More particularly we must know the broad 
truths concerning the growth of the mind in relation to the growth 
of the body. We must know that all action—the word is here used 
in its broadest sense—within the body is performed and controlled 
by means of the brain and nerves, and be able to conceive of the 
nerves. of human beings as belonging to a series of systems, We 
may for our present needs distinguish actions as belonging to 
the lowest, middle, or highest nerve centres. The nerves of the lowest 
centres which control such involuntary and automatic physical 
actions as breathing, the circulation of the blood, and the processes 
of digestion, start at birth into full activity, needing no control 
on the part of the mind. Those of the highest centres, on the con- 
trary, which have to do with purely intellectual activity—e.g. think- 
ing, resolving, discriminating—are relatively undeveloped and un- 
organised at birth, and only become organised gradually through 
conscious, directed effort. Besides the lowest and highest centres, 
there are the middle centres, less fully organised and active than 
the one, more fully than the other, and differing even among them- 
selves in their degree of development, and in the time and rate at 
which they reach full and perfect activity. Among these, develop- 
ing in the order in which they are mentioned, are the centres which 
bring the hand and’eye‘into'sympatheticaction,and those which con- 
trol'the legs and feet inwalking,and the lips and other speech organs 
in talking—broadly speaking, those which govern all the voluntary 
muscular movements. At a later stage these centres for muscular
-P-A-G-E-381
368 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
action, which are in the brain, are brought into relation with each 
other, so that sensations in one centre may give rise to, or call up, 
those in another—e.g. the sight of an orange may suggest its taste ; 
the creak of a waggon may raise a vision of the waggon and span 
trekking ; the touch of an object may tell us its form, or the smell 
of a.favourite dish in cooking may call up the taste. It is with the 
training of these middle centres that the mental education of early 
years, and physical education throughout its whole course, are 
principally concerned ; for, while education can do little to aid 
the development of the lowest centres, it can do much to modify 
the action of the middle ones, and through them to react upon 
the highest of all. It is through such reaction that physical drill 
has its secondary, educative importance in securing “ alertness, 
decision, concentration, and perfect control of mind over body.” 
With regard to the early training of these middle centres, the 
work done recently at the’ Montessori schools is particularly in- 
teresting and suggestive. In these we are told: 
“Various items in the way of motor-training—buttoning and 
unbuttoning, tying and untying, hooking and unhooking, lacing, 
and so forth, are all a part of the lessons of the little ones. .. . They 
are lessons which the child works out for himself. He is allowed 
the pleasure and the triumph of finding out how to do things. To 
a certain extent imitation comes in, since he sees the other children 
doing these things. There is also a regular system of sense-training 
for which some of the materials used are the regular kindergarten 
gifts. In other cases they are . . . every-day objects which are 
adapted to the purpose. . . . In the plays and lessons constant 
use is made of the principle of establishing the associations between 
visual, muscular, tactile, and auditory sensations. For example 
in the sight-training the children have a set of cubes graded from 
large to small. They are given these to pile up in the graduated 
order. They are taught to run their fingers along the outlines, 
and thus connect the muscular, tactile, and visual sensations. 
Then they have blindfold games, in which the blocks are piled 
wholly by the sense of touch, the children finding a great delight 
in discovering, when the bandage is taken from their eyes, that they 
have ‘seen with their fingers.’ For training the colour sense a 
series of. tablets, or silk-winders, wound with either silk or wool 
in eight colours, is used. Each colour is represented in eight

a Physical Education 369 
different intensities, and various games are played with these 
tablets until the children grow expert in matching and grading them. 
There are also some exercises in discrimination of sounds, tastes, 
and smells, though the two last are of less importance educationally. 
All this sense-training finds an immediate application in practical 
life.” 
As a result of these muscular and sense exercises : 
“ Tn her first school Dr. Montessori found that the children from 
three-and-a-half to four-and-a-half years old were already fairly 
expert in the preliminary training. They could dress and undress 
themselves. That is, they had learned to apply practically their 
various exercises in buttoning, unbuttoning, lacing, tying, &c. ; 
they had learned to be neat in person; they had had considerable 
sense-training, and they were eager for something more: in fact 
they clamoured to be taught to read and write, and the experiment 
was tried with surprising results.” (Theodate L. Smith in The 
Montessori System.) 
For the lowest centres, then, we can do nothing beyond correct- 
ing defects of nature and environment ; and giving them the material 
and means for free growth by provision of healthy conditions in 
regard to air, food, clothing and rest. But by such well-chosen and 
properly graded exercises as are described above much can be done 
in the later stages of infant life to develop the middle centres which 
have to bring the various voluntary muscles and organs into sym- 
pathetic action. Being only partly organised at birth, these centres 
require training to fit them to fulfil their functions, to adapt them 
to the ends—seeing, handling, walking, hearing, talking, drawing, 
moulding, shaping, folding, fitting, carving—for which they are the 
means, Such preparation for formal education must be a child’s 
first schooling. To set him, on his entry into school, to struggle 
with formal reading, writing and arithmetic, would be to neglect 
the middle nerve centres at a time when they are naturally most 
active, and, therefore, most ready for direction ; and, at the same 
tine, to make demands on the highest centres for activities which 
they are not ripe to perform. More than this, if Nature’s time for 
the development of the middle centres is passed by without provi- 
sion being made for their proper exercise, no amount of it at a later 
age will have equally good results. 
At this point we may return to the subject of an ordered scheme 
2A
-P-A-G-E-383
370 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
of physical exercises, which we had to leave in order to consider 
briefly the necessary knowledge of physiological facts, without which 
we are unfitted either to plan or to supervise such exercises. 
The aim of such an ordered scheme is twofold. There is on one 
side the aim to secure, maintain, and, if possible, improve, the bodily 
health and build of the pupils, and on the other the aim to develop, 
as a result, alertness of movement and of mind—decision in action 
and concentration of effort, leading to perfect mental control of 
bodily activity. While these aims may be distinguished as physical 
and educational, it is impossible entirely to separate the exercises 
which have the one} from those which have the other aim in view. 
As a general rule those directed to a physical end are simple, and 
are taken early, while those which have educative purpose combine 
several movements, and havea later place. Each fulfilment of 
the physical aim has, however, its educational value as well. To 
go back to what has just been written, the exercises with physical 
aim develop the lowest and middle centres, those with educational 
purpose the highest, but all are interdependent. 
Following the classification of the English Board of Education’s 
syllabus, we may divide exercises with physical aim into nutritive, 
corrective, and controlling. The nutritive exercises are those which, 
acting upon breathing and circulation, the activities of the lowest 
nerve centres, stimulate through them the digestive processes, and so 
improve the body’s chances of nourishment. Of these nutritive 
exercises there are three subdivisions. One includes large move- 
ments, particularly of the lower limbs, with immediate effect 
shown in breathlessness and an increase of the heat of the body. 
Running, jumping, and skipping are natural forms of these move- 
ments ; and, where children indulging in them have a sufficient 
supply of fresh air and nourishing food, they result in a stimulation 
of the building-up processes which makes for a strong and healthy 
physique. The unnatural restraining of activity, in some degree 
inseparable from the conditions of school life, renders the provision 
of such exercise necessary in the intervals of lessons ; and it is better 
if it can be taken in the form of play. Running games, with 
skipping for girls and jumping for boys, should particularly be 
encouraged. Where these are out of the question, marching—in 
slow and quick time and at the double—must take their place. 
Another division includes exercises, the main effect of which is on 
the muscles engaged in respiration. Their aim is to make lung
-P-A-G-E-384
Physical Education ¢ 371 
action slower and deeper. Breathing exercises and those move- 
ments of the arms which tend to increase the space enclosed by 
the chest walls are types of them. These bring us to- what is 
unquestionably the most vitally important of all forms of physical 
exercise, while it is perhaps the most neglected of them all in school 
practice—lung culture. In the report of the Royal Commission on 
Physical Training (Scotland) it was stated by an eminent physician 
that “if we can introduce exercises that will develop the lungs we 
shall not only make [the child] fit for everything it attempts in after 
life, but we shall probably do a great deal to abolish what men are 
so anxious to abolish now, the curse of consumption.” There is 
little doubt that efficient breathing would do much to preserve the 
life and health of those who suffer from lung diseases. It is a known 
fact that singers live longer and are healthier as a class on account 
of the constant exercise of their lungs through the deep breathing 
that singing demands ; and vocal exercises in school, rightly per- 
formed, play an important part in the development of physical 
health. Full deep breathing, with proper chest expansion, results 
in strong healthy lungs. Like all habits, this vitally important one 
is most easily and efficiently acquired in youth. Better respiration 
also means better digestion and nourishment, and a stimulation of 
all the organs concerned in the discharge of impurities from the 
system, as is seen in the clearing of the skin which follows upon it. 
It promotes, too, a healthy warmth of the body, which makes light 
clothing sufficient even in cold weather ; and finally, it is one of 
the best means of straightening the spine and preventing chest 
deformities. 
The first condition of good breathing is a proper carriage of the 
body. The chest should be held well forward by a slight inward 
arch of the back, while the lower trunk should be supported in an 
erect position by the muscles provided for the purpose. Such a 
position will bring the front of the chest and the tip of the toes into 
a straight line with one another. Constantly maintained, it gives 
ease, grace, and strength to the body, and should be taughttoalll chil- 
dren, They should be encouraged to get it before a glass, and to prac- 
tise it until it is maintained always—naturally and unconsciously, 
In view of the vital importance of breathing exercises a few are 
given below. They’ are suitable for use before or after the custo- 
mary physical exercises, or as preliminary to speaking, reading, or 
singing lessons.

~ _- Av Simpre BreaTuinc Exercises 
. Note. ~—Exercises should be regulated by the teacher—either by 
hand. movements or by numbers. Breathing-in must at all times 
be through the nose, the channel provided for the purpose. In the 
absence of thorough cleanliness, and through want of attention to 
colds and other ailments causing partial stoppage of the nasal pas- 
sages, many children learn in infancy to breathe through the mouth. 
Of these quite a large proportion, through continual neglect, develop 
actual obstructions to correct breathing. Any difficulty experi- 
enced by the pupils in this matter should be the subject. of careful 
inquiry. If there is permanent stoppage of the nasal passages, the 
" child should ‘be examined by a doctor in order that the matter may 
be put right. - The presence of adenoids may often be detected 
through the habit it leads to of keeping the mouth open—the 
dropped lower jaw giving.a vacant, unintelligent expression to the 
face. They should receive immediate attention. When nasal 
breathing -becomes the rule the power of attention on the part of 
certain children will be found to improve, and their general in- 
telligence to increase. It is thus of the greatest importance edu- 
cationally, as well as from the health standpoint. : 
In every-case the exercise should be executed in a perfect manner 
by the instructor before the learners are allowed to attempt it. In 
all physical exercises a good example is of great importance. 
Exercise 1. Slow Breathing-in. 
Breathe in slowly in sich a manner as to bring all the muscles of 
the chest into.play. The first responsive movement is a forward one 
of the body below the waist. This is then converted into an out- 
ward movement of the ribs, and finally into an upward and forward 
one of the breast-borie—the chest capacity being thus increased in 
three directions.- Repeat ten or fifteen times, resting between each. 
Exercise 2. Slow Breathing-in—Quick Breathing-out. 
Breathe in as fully and deeply as possible ; then with mouth 
wide open let the air escape immediately, but without force. Both 
‘movements must be easily and regularly performed | ‘with a short 
rest after each respiration. After three double movernents take at 
Teast three ordinary breaths. Repeat twelve times. 
Exercise 3. Panting Breathing-out. 
“Breathe in as before, and then instead of breathing out steadily

do so in puffs. The lengths of the puffs and the intervals between 
them may be varied, but the class should be kept together, their 
action being regulated by the teacher. Repeat six times. 
Exercise 4. Singing Breathing-out. : 
Breathe in as before ; sing quietly and evenly doh, ray, me, ray, 
te, and then breathe out remaining breath quickly. » 
B. BREATHING EXERCISES wiTH MovEeMENTS 
Exercise 1. Stand at attention. Breathe in as the trunk is 
slowly stretched back ; breathe out as it is bent forward, : 
Exercise 2. Stand at attention. Set the shoulders. back slowly, 
strenuously breathing in meanwhile; breathe out as they are 
brought forward. This Strengthens the muscles, holding the shoul- 
ders in position, and so is an aid to correct carriage. 
Exercise 3. Stand with arms stretched out sideways, level with 
shoulders, palms up. Raise them slowly until the hands meet 
overhead, breathing in slowly the while. Breathe out as the arms 
are returned to the horizontal position. Rest. Repeat. : 
Exercise 4. Stand with arms stretched out in front level with 
the shoulders, palms facing. Force the arms outwards and back- 
wards as far as possible, keeping them level and breathing. in the 
while. Breathe out as the arms are brought back to starting posi- 
tion, This is a capital exercise for strengthening the muscles of the 
back. 
_These exercises well executed each day, about halfway through 
morning school, independently of the usual drill lessons, will more 
than repay the time spent on them. Performed under proper con- 
ditions—in the playground or in a well-ventilated classroom, with 
doors and windows as widely open as the weather will allow—they 
will be found not only easy but exhilarating. As imitative moye- 
ments they should be used in the lowest sub-standard class, for the 
formation of a habit of correct breathing is among the most import- 
ant and beneficial of infant-school exercises. A: 
The third subdivision of nutritive exercises includes those which 
involve the lifting of weights, or pulling against resistance, thus 
acting powerfully on breathing and circulation. They are, however, 
quite unsuitable for young children, as they demand sustained effort. 
Even for older pupils they should only -be used.in the form of 
exercises with light dumb-bells. Da,
-P-A-G-E-387
374. The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
‘The corrective exercises have for their chief aim the correction, 
as far as possible, of certain bodily defects which, where care is not 
taken, are made worse by the conditions of school life. Among these 
exercises are head-and-trunk backward-bending—to correct the effect 
of the cramped position frequently assumed over desk-work ; and 
heel-raising—to correct flat-footedness. With regard to the former, 
however, it is quite clear that little can be done in the short periods 
of physical exercise if between them the children are allowed to 
yeassume injurious postures. As was said at the beginning of this 
chapter, attention to position during ordinary lessons must be 
looked upon as an essential part of our scheme of physical education. 
There remain the control exercises, which are on the border line 
between the exercises with physical and those with educational 
aim. These exercises act chiefly on the nervous system, and are 
directed to acquiring control over muscular movement by the nerve 
centres. The balance exercises belong to this class. Among 
natural forms dancing, cycling, skating, tennis, cricket, football, 
and the boys’ pastime of walking on stilts {may be instanced. 
When first attempted, all these exercises—both the natural and 
artificial balance movements—require concentration of mind. The 
effort is at first laborious, and mastery is only gained at the cost 
of considerable fatigue. But the fatigue becomes less with continued 
repetitions, and at last the exercises seem to be almost self-performed. 
Their value as educative exercises ceases at this point, but their 
physical effect continues, and is even increased. The same exercise, 
therefore, may be taken for two different reasons—in its early 
stages for its educative value, and, after mastery, for its physical 
effect. The times at which, and the way in which, the exercises are 
taken must be decided with reference to this difference of purpose. 
During each week there should be for each class two or three 
periods, in which new exercises are taught and treated, as regards 
insistence or concentration of attention and effort, like other school 
lessons. The length of these lessons must be suited to the age of 
the children, and such an arrangement of the exercise be made as 
will demand a due amount of effort without causing strain, while 
greater accuracy and precision must be exacted after repeated 
practice, and from older children. That the educational effect 
may be maintained, new movements or new combinations must 
be introduced—though gradually—up to the end of the course. A 
suitable succession of exercises should be arranged on the guiding

principle that rapid and vigorous movements should be taken for a 
short time only, and be followed by slow and steady ones for re- 
ducing temperature and breathing. 
‘The Board of Education’s Syllabus provides—after preliminary 
class arrangements and elementary starting positions : 
Arm Flexionsand Extensions. Head and Trunk Exercises. 
Balance Exercises. Forward and Backward Bending. 
Shoulder Exercises. Turning and Sideways Bending. 
Lunge Exercises (umsuztable Marching ; Jumping. 
Sor young children). Deep Breathing Exercises. 
In each formal lesson an. exercise, or exercises, from each main 
group should be taken. 
In addition to the formal lessons, daily exercise through simple, 
rapid movements previously mastered, should be given as relief 
from hard mental exertion, or a prolonged keeping of one position. 
The effects of such exercises are not lasting, and therefore to be of 
benefit they must be repeated three or four times in a session. These, 
for the saving of time, may be taken in the desks, though this will 
render a good many exercisés unsuitable. They will be found to 
have a recreative effect on children who have been sitting closely to 
a task for a considerable time. The breathing exercises suggested 
are among the best for this purpose. 
The exercises in the English Board of Education’s Syllabus are 
intended for children from seven to twelve years. They under- 
rate rather than overrate the physical capacity and endurance of 
normal children of this age ; but in cases of insufficient feeding or 
constitutional weakness individual children should be excused from 
the practice of them. Breathlessness may be a sign that an exercise 
is beyond a child’s physical capacity ; and inquiry should follow 
any noticeable sign of it. It may point to unsuitability of dress, 
or may prove a case for exemption, or even for medical advice. 
~Suitable physical exercises for infants have been indicated in 
the-account of the Montessori schools’ practice. To these must be 
added breathing exercises, and some of the simpler exercises of the 
Syllabus may be included. Marching, singing with action, and fre- 
quent plays and games form, of course, part of every infant-school 
scheme. In the formal exercises accuracy and precision must not be 
looked for at first. These can only come when the middle centres 
have had some degree of training. 
In the Montessori schools, exercises both for development and
-P-A-G-E-389
376 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
for grace of movement are given, thesystem providing for the normal 
development of natural physical movements—walking, breathing— 
and aiming at the correction of any apparent faults. The exercises 
are adapted to the strength and build of the body at this period, 
and special regard is paid to the relative weakness of the legs. Much 
is accomplished by means of plays and games, The pendulum 
play—in which the children sit on stools around a rubber ball hung 
by.a-cord and, leaning forward in turn, strike it with the hand--- 
exercises with good effect the muscles of the back while avoiding 
all strain on the legs. This play might easily be adopted in our 
own infant rooms. 
Music should not be played while exercises are being learnt by 
older children ; but may be used after they have been mastered. 
During the learning process it takes away from the educative value, 
for the rhythm acts as a stimulus and lessens the need for that effort 
of will that is required for gaining control of the nerve-centres. For 
younger children it may be used more frequently, as it has the effect 
—valuable at this stage—of lessening fatigue; but even in their 
case it should sometimes be given up in order that more real effort 
may go to the mastering of the exercises. 
While the physical exercises of the syllabus are such as can be 
performed in ordinary easy dress, the adoption by girls of a light 
loose tunic over knickers gives greater freedom, of movement for 
drill, and should be encouraged. - Drill shoes—light, heelless and 
rubber-soled—are almost a necessity. 
A few directions for guidance in the conduct of the lessons 
follow : 
We must be able to conduct the exercises in all formal lessons 
without reference to a handbook ;_ and before any exercise is prac- 
tised by the class we should perform it, ourselves as perfectly as 
possible, or choose, for the special smartness of his movements, a 
scholar to do-so. 
We must see that our directions are clear and concise, well- 
worded and correctly delivered. 
After directions we ‘must: have all exercises performed, at first, 
to distinct words of command. Later, they may be regulated by 
numbers or hand-movements. The manner of command has such an 
effect on performance that it is of great importance. The words of 
command should be those given in the syllabus, and each command 
‘should be preceded by a caution. The command therefore consists
-P-A-G-E-390
| 
; 
  Physical Education : 377 
of two parts—one of warning, and one which is to be immediately 
followed by action. ‘The cautionary words should be given slowly 
and distinctly while the command itself, which should as a rule be 
a single word, should follow a slight pause and be given sharply 
or with prolonged smoothness as the exercise demands, e.g. 
Eyes—Right! (sharply), Trunk backward—ben-n-nd! (slowly 
and smoothly). : 
_ We should give no directions and make no corrections while the 
class. is in a strained position. Where these are necessary, the 
class must first be recalled to.an easy posture. 
Finally, we must remember—in the closing words of the intro- 
duction to the Syllabus—that “ there is no part of school work in 
which the spirit and intention of the teacher are so clearly seen in 
the performance of the children, as in physical exercises.” 
For us, as for the children we teach, physical health is the only 
base. on which sound mind-work can be built ; and for us, as for 
them, it can only result from proper conditions of life in regard to 
fresh air, food, cleanliness, exercise and rest. These conditions 
have already been considered and all that remains to be done is 
to emphasize one or two points which are sometimes disregarded. 
To provide for the entry of fresh air into our living and sleeping 
rooms is not of itself sufficient ; we must also provide for its entry 
into our lungs. This we may do by means of the exercises in deep 
breathing described on an earlier page. We should continue them 
until deep breathing becomes a habit. When the action goes on of 
itself night and day—purifying the blood, cleansing the skin and 
stimulating the digestion—our bodies will be in a state to gain full 
nourishment from the food we take and to turn it to the best 
account in all forms of muscle and mind work. 
Food is of equal importance, and we should know sufficient of 
its principles, and of the principles of cooking and serving it to 
save us from becoming the victims of those who do not. It is 
only possible to emphasize, here, the necessity for a sufficiency of 
green vegetables and fresh fruits, which should form a-part of 
every day’s food ; and the “‘liverish” effect of starchy and fatty 
foods eaten to excess. . 
It must be remembered, too, that the state of the body at.the 
time of eating has almost as much to do with digestion as the food 
itself. We should make a practice of getting home from school
-P-A-G-E-391
378 Tlie School, the Child, and the Teacher 
for a meal about. half an hour before we expect to sit down to it, 
especially in the case of the heaviest meal in the day; and if 
fatigue from the morning’s or afternoon’s work is making itself 
felt we should spend this half hour resting. We should not do 
any mind work at this time—should not, for instance, attempt 
to get up one of the afternoon’s lessons. We should not—even if 
we live or dine alone—let ourselves get into the habit of reading 
at meal times. We should drink between meals rather than during 
them. This applies particularly to cold water and to tea if meat 
is being eaten. 
We must take sufficient exercise S for the needs of the body— 
not, certainly, less than an hour daily ; and should take it, when- 
ever possible, in the open air. The time for artificial forms of 
exercise is over. Even earlier, they are only meant to supply the 
place of natural forms, to correct defects and faulty tendencies, 
and to relieve, during school hours, the strain of long continuance 
in one position, Walking is one of the very best forms of exercise, 
and those of us who walk for an hour daily will have no need to 
fear that our health will suffer for want of exercise. But some 
part of our exercise should be taken, if possible, in the form of 
games, for the social intercourse arising out of them gives a zest 
to exercise which makes it additionally beneficial. Above all, we 
must consider that we have failed in our duty if we have not taken 
a full hour in the day for some form of recreative exercise. Time 
must be saved for this, however busy we are. 
Six to eight hours’ daily rest in sleep should be our aim. Again, 
as in the case of food, the conditions under which it is taken are 
of the greatest importance. Refreshing sleep can only be had in 
a well-ventilated room. It is better not to go to bed straight 
from hard mind work; but to give the brain time to settle into 
“quietness after a lengthened period of activity. Good physical health 
can only be maintained by taking due care to secure the right con- 
ditions. And we owe the taking of this care to the children we 
teach. Nervousness, irritability, gloom result from undermined 
health ; and afflicted by any one of these we cannot go “ blithely 
on oar business all the day ’”’—cannot meet our pupils with that 
cheerful pleasure in our duty of teaching them which they have 
a right to expect.

CHAPTER XVII 
CONTINUATION. OF EDUCATION AFTER TRAINING 
“ Youth shows but half—”-—BROWNING. 
«* When men are rightly oceupied their amusement grows out of their work 
as the colour petals out of a fruitful flower.”—Rusktn. 
“ There are three great questions which in life we have over and over again 
to answer; Is it right or wrong? Is it true or false? Is it beautiful or ugly? 
Our education ought to help us to answer these questions.” —AVEBURY. 
“The morning drum-call on my eager ear 
Thrills unforgotten yet ; the morning dew 
Lies yet undried along my field of noon. 
But now I pause at whiles in what I do, 
And count the bell, and tremble lest I hear 
(My work untrimmed) the sunset gun too soon.” 
R. L. STEVENSON. 
Our consideration of the work of the school and the interests of 
the child ends with the last chapter, but the personality and cul- 
ture of the teacher are so closely bound up with both, that these 
now call for thought. 
The training which it is possible for student-teachers to undergo 
during the three years in which they study and practise at college 
or centre, can do no more than start them on the road which the 
educator has to travel. When they leave college behind, this road 
stretches in front of them-——climbing over many a hill of difficulty, 
going down into many a valley of depression ; a lonely road in 
places, but offering companionship and comradeship from point 
to point ; refreshed, too, by green shade, brightened by wayside 
flowers, made musical by the noise of running water; having 
blue mountain ridges and shining, purple peaks on its far horizon, 
keeping sometimes within sound of the sea, and leading on and on 
into the City of Happy Childhood.

Let ‘us turn from the difficulties, the depression and the loneli: 
mess. What is the companionship offered us on our road of life 
and work? It is the spiritual friendship of great educators who 
have passed along the road before us, and it is offered to us in 
books—trecords of their lives left by themselves or made by other men 
and women. We should read both biographies and autobiographies, 
for as Quick, in his Essays on Educational Reformers, reminds us : 
« Some of these men have no great talent for speech or writing 
and they try to express the truths they see, not so much by books 
as by action. . . . But sometimes the man of genius has a great 
power over language, and then he finds for the truths he has seen, 
fitting expression, which becomes almost as lasting as the truths 
they tell. . If the historian of education is asked ‘What did 
Montaigne “do?? he will answer, Nothing” ‘What did Froebel 
say?’ ‘He said a great deal, but very few people can read him 
and still fewer understand him.’ Both, however, are and must 
remain forces in education. Montaigne has given to some truths 
imperishable form in his Essays and Froebel’s ideas come home to all 
the world in the Kindergarten.” 
We should learn to know some of these educators, then, through 
their words and some through their works made known by the 
words of others. 
: Probably the two men whose companionship will be most helpful 
to us in general class-teaching are Froebel and Herbart, two German 
teachers who lived, taught and wrote in the first half of the nine- 
teenth century. Both, as it happens, belong to the former of the 
two classes distinguished above, being men of genius but without 
the gift of simple, lucid expression to make their ideas clear to the 
ordinary reader. As Froebel was concerned chiefly with the teach- 
ing of infants, it will be well to pursue his acquaintance first. What 
is written of him in The Infant School may serve to introduce us to 
him. We need, however, to know him better than we can learn to 
do through what is written there, and must turn to some more de- 
tailed “Life” of him. After this, it is possible that our wish to 
learn all that he can teach us will lead some of us to try and read 
his Education of Man and his autobiography. 
Of Herbart’s educational theories and practice alittle has been 
said in Chapter III, but this is a bare introduction. The writers of 
The Infant School and The Art of Teaching may help to make him
-P-A-G-E-395
382 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
better known and to give the desire for still closer acquaintance. 
This we may gain from the Herbartian Psychology of Professor 
Adams, from The Student's Herbart of Mr. F. H. Hayward and from 
the Introduction to Herbartian Principles of Teaching of Miss C. I. 
Dodd. 
“But other companionship is offered. In Pestalozzi (1746-1827), 
whom both Froebel and Herbart visited and of whom both learnt, 
we shall learn to know a teacher who experienced all the difficulties 
encountered by those of us whose work lies, as his did, among 
children of the lowest peasant class. We may be sure then of his 
sympathy and help. Long before our day he looked at his pupils 
and 
. . asked himself what was needed to raise them. Knowledge 
would not do it. ‘The thing was not that they should know what 
they did not know, but that they should behave as they did not 
behave’; and the road to right action lay through right feeling. 
If they could be made conscious that they were loved and cared 
for, their hearts would open and give back love and respect in 
return. More than this, they must be taught not only to respect 
their elders but also themselves.” (Quick: Essays on Educational 
Reformers.) . 
With Pestalozzi, too, we can come into closer touch through 
his own writings. His Leonard and Gertrude is a tale written by 
him in response to the urging of friends, to describe the life of the 
peasantry he knew and loved ; to show why they were so wretched, 
and how their wretchedness might be relieved. This book, of 
which there are four parts combined in an English translation by 
Miss Eva Channing, will be found not only helpful but amusing. 
“ All good teachers,” we are told, “ should read it with care, and 
if they thus read it and catch anything of the spirit of Pestalozzi, 
both they and their pupils will have reason to rejoice.” If we de- 
spair of making any impression on our pupils, Pestalozzi will tell 
us that: 
“The first development of the child’s powers should come through 
his participation in the work of his home ; for this work is what his 
parents understand best, what most absorbs their attention, and 
what they can best teach. But even if this were not so, work 
undertaken to supply real needs would be¥just as truly the surest 
foundation of a good education. To engage the attention of the
-P-A-G-E-396
  Continuation of Education after Training 383 
child, to exercise his judgment, to raise his heart to noble sentiments, 
these I think the chief ends of education.” 
and that : 
“The entire absence of school learning was what troubled me 
least, for I trusted in the natural powers that God bestows on even 
the poorest and most neglected children. I had observed for a long 
time that behind their coarseness, shyness, and apparent incapacity, 
are hidden the finest faculties, the most precious powers ; and now, 
even amongst these poor children by whom I was surrounded at 
Stang, marked natural abilities soon began to show themselves. 
I knew how useful the common needs of life are in teaching men the 
relations of things, in bringing out their natural intelligence, in 
forming their judgment, and in arousing faculties which, buried, 
as it were, beneath the coarser elements of their nature, cannot 
become active and useful till they are set free. It was my object 
then to set free these faculties, and bring them to bear on the pure 
and simple circumstances of domestic life, for I was convinced this 
was all that was wanting, and these faculties would show them- 
selves capable of raising the hearts and minds of my pupils to all 
that I could desire.” 
- Of French educational writers there are three to whom we 
should give attention—Rabelais, Montaigne and Rousseau. The 
first two (born in 1483 and 1533 respectively) should be studied in 
the light of the Renaissance, and the first essay in Quick, which 
treats of it, will be found useful for this purpose. The short essay 
(V) on Rabelais may serve to make us acquainted with the educa- 
tional ideas—chief among them the idea of learning about things 
from the things themselves, and of giving attention to physical 
education—put forward in the scheme for the schooling of Gar- 
gantua, though extracts from his writings 1 would usefully supple- 
ment this. The teaching of Montaigne—who would have us turn 
from mere bookishness in education, put wisdom before learning, 
stop stuffing the memory with words and discover and use the riches 
of our own minds—is also briefly summarised in Quick’s essay VI, 
while there is a complete translation of Montaigne’s own Essays into 
English.* Rousseau takes us forward’again near to the time of the

Swiss and:German reformers. ‘He died in 1778, eleven years before 
the outbreak of the French Revolution, which his writings helped 
to bring about, and five years before the birth of Froebel. His 
general attitude towards the educational practice of his day is 
written of in The Infant School, and at considerably more length 
by Quick, who lays emphasis on the fact that Rousseau was “ the 
first to base education entirely on a study of the child to be edu- 
cated.”? But we should read parts, at least, of his Emile for our- 
selves. A man who boldly declares “ Everything is good as it 
leaves the hands of the Creator: everything degenerates in the 
hands of man,’ is sure to prove a stimulating companion. 
There are two sixteenth-century English schoolmasters and one 
teacher and writer of the seventeenth century who should not be 
neglected—Ascham and Mulcaster, and Locke. These are dealt 
with in Educational Theories in England (H. Thiselton Mark), 
and Quick has essays on all of them. Ascham is interesting as the 
Latin tutor of Queen Elizabeth and Lady Jane Grey ; 3 as one of 
the first teachers to revolt against the flogging practices of his time, 
and by reason of his attempted reform of language teaching. The 
quotation at the head of Chapter VIII is from his great work 
The Scholemaster, published in 1570. Mulcaster is remarkable 
as having advanced three hundred years ago many of the argu- 
ments used by educational reformers of the present day. As 
Quick says: 
“The latest advances in pedagogy have established (z) that the 
end and aim of education is to develop mind and body ; (2) that 
all teaching processes should be carefully adapted to the mental 
constitution of the learner ; (3) that the first stage in learning is 
of immense importance and requires a very high degree of skill 
in the teacher ; (4) that the brain of children, especially of clever 
children, should not be subjected to pressure ; (5) that childhood 
should not be spent in learning foreign languages, but that its 
language should be the mother tongue, and its exercises should 
include handiwork, especially drawing; (6) that girls’ education 
should be cared for no less than boys’; (7) that the only hope of 
improving our schools lies in providing training for our teachers. 
These are all regarded as planks in the platform of “the new 
education,” and these were all advocated by Mulcaster.” 
Unfortunately, Mulcaster’s own style in writing is fantastic and

a le ee Continuation of Education after Training 385 
affected to a degree that proves irritating to most readers. His 
Positions the first word of a long title—is his great work. 
Locke, who was a private tutor, is"perhaps of less interest to 
class teachers ; but there is much of value for us in his Thoughts 
Concerning Education, the reading of which should follow a study 
of Quick’s essay on him. As a physician he gave an important 
Place to physical education : 
“ His experience had shown him that the health of children was 
often spoiled by too much pampering and tenderness. It is his 
opinion that physical strength consists chiefly in the ability to 
endure hardships. He speaks in praise of swimming and of being 
as much as possible in the open air and as little as possible by the 
fireside, “‘ even in winter.” The clothing should be loose and free, 
the diet plain and simple, and there should be no stint of sleep in 
early childhood.” (Educational Theories in England.) 
Among later English writers on education we should turn 
sometimes to Herbert Spencer, who advocated the acquiring of 
scientific or natural knowledge, as opposed to mere book-learning, 
and would have schemes of education determined by the answer to 
the question: What knowledge is of most worth? He has been 
misunderstood in some quarters and misjudged in others ; but his 
voice has been influential in giving a more practicalturn to education 
and urgent as to the teacher’s need of creating “a pleasurable 
excitement ” in his pupils. 
Arnold of Rugby and Thring of Uppingham, two great English 
schoolmasters of the last century, looked on character-forming as 
the first of their duties. Their companionship will be helpful to 
us who are engaged in the same work. 
But there are great educators who have not been concerned 
with either the theory or the practice of education in schools. The 
great poets and prose writers and scientists are educators even 
though they never wrote or uttered a word about education. 
Their companionship is offered too, and we should avail ourselves 
of it as often as we can. Their subjects are life and character, and 
these must be more to us than lessons are. 
It is an innumerable company, and when we first find ourselves 
» Positions, wherein those Primitive Circumstances be examined which are 
ecessary for the Training up of Children either for Skill in their Book or 
{ealth in their Body. 
2B
-P-A-G-E-399
386 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
in it we may hesitate, not knowing what companionship to choose. 
But if we remember where our road leads the choice becomes easy, 
and we turn first of all to the child-lovers—the brothers Grimm, 
Hans Andersen, Charles Lamb, Charles Kingsley, Lewis Carroll, 
Robert Louis Stevenson, Andrew Lang, Kenneth Grahame, Mrs. 
Ewing, L. Allen Harker and Edith Nesbit ; to the creator of Peter 
Pan and the writer of the /ust-So Stories and The jungle Books. 
We are not likely to feel the need of further introductions, for each 
writer will make known to us others whom he himself loves. 
Of two—Ruskin, and Robert Louis Stevenson, named among 
the child-lovers—we should make friends early, for some of their 
words are addressed to youth especially. In Sesame and Lilies 
are three lectures: Of King’s Treasuries, Of Queen’s Gardens, and 
The Mystery of Life and its Arts. The first is addressed particu- 
larly to young men, and Ruskin tells us in his preface, that it : 
/ “__tries to say that, life being very short, and the quiet hours 
a “of it few, we ought to waste none of them in reading valueless 
books ; and that valuable books should, in a civilised country, 
be within the reach of every one, printed in excellent form, for a 
just price ; but not in any vile, vulgar, or, by reason of smallness 
of type, physically injurious form, at a vile price... . As no 
person in decent circumstances would put on his table confessedly 
bad wing, or bad meat, without being ashamed, so he should not 
have or his shelves ill-printed or loosely and wretchedly-stitched 
books... . And I should urge upon every young man, as the 
beginsfing of his due and wise provision for his household, to obtain 
as s6on as he can, by the severest economy, a restricted, serviceable, 
and steadily—however slowly—increasing series of books for use 
through life; making his little library, of all the furniture in his 
room, the most studied and decorative piece ; every volume having 
its assigned place, like a little statue in its niche, and one of the 
earliest and strictest lessons to the children of the house being how 
to turn the pages of their own literary possessions lightly and 
deliberately, with no chance of tearing or dogs’ ears.”     
The two following lectures, he says, were : 
— written in the hope of awakening the youth of England 
Go he was an Englishman writing in England), so far as my poor 
words might have any power with them, to take some thought of
-P-A-G-E-400
        Continuation of Education after Training 387 
the purposes of the life into which they are entering and the 
nature of the world they have to conquer.” 
So we see how closely they concern young men and girls— 
which to Ruskin means that they may, if they will, be kings and 
queens—whose work is so intimately bound up with “ the mystery 
of Jife and its arts.” 
The book in which Robert Louis Stevenson addresses himself 
to youth declares in its title, Virginibus Puerisque, that it is 
written for girls and boys. 
But with whatever definite intention books may have been 
written for us, it cannot of itself make them ours. Our reading of 
them must accomplish that. We must not be content to read 
them once, or ten, or fifty times, and then to put them away on 
our shelves and forget them ; but, as we read them through the 
first time, should mark the passages that strike us, and then read 
im them constantly—read this page because we liked it ; that one 
because we felt that we understood it so well; another, because 
we didn’t understand it at all, but know that, being written for 
us, it has some meaning which it may be dangerous for us to lose ; 
another still, because, while understanding, we disagreed with it. 
[t may be that we are wrong. It will be well to read it again 
after having thought the matter over. Ruskin states very definitely 
why he wrote Sesame and Lilies. What was the purpose of 
Robert Louis Stevenson in writing Virginibus Puerisque? He 
-vrote, one feels, for girls and boys in order to help them. Having 
umself passed through the adolescent stage of life to which they 
.ave come, he knew its pleasures and its pitfalls, its difficulties 
nd its delights, and he wished to help them to increase the one 
nd avoid the other, to overcome the one and enjoy the otlier, 
md to use and benefit by all. Ruskin, on the other hand, wrote 
or the youth of his own nation first, but of other nations too, if 
such should read him, to show them how they might help the 
world. Yet there is, after all, but little difference between the two 
motives, for there is a law of benefits—of help, among the rest— 
which requires that they be passed on. If we have gained help 
in one place, we must give it in another, and so with the rest of 
benefits. Where Stevenson then writes gaily, but with serious 
purpose, his Apology for Idlers, or On falling in love; on Crabbed 
Youth and Age, or on Truth of Intercourse, though he may nowhere 
2B2
-P-A-G-E-401
388 The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
hint it, he none the less means that the good we get from his ex- 
perience, wit and truth shall be given again. His purpose is, 
therefore, the same as Ruskin’s, who earnestly and, as he himself 
says, passionately, tells us what is wrong with the world, and urges 
us to take some thought and make some effort, so far as lies in us, 
to put it right. 
But while we are making our way along the road in close com- 
panionship with these two writers, for there is no danger of our 
out-growing them, we should be widening our circle of companion- 
ship, and this chiefly among the poets. The greatest of each nation 
—Homer, Shakespeare, Dante, Virgil, Petrarch, Victor Hugo, 
Goethe, Vondel—we should seek in their chief works ; and should 
also get to know Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth, Keats, Shelley, 
Browning, Swinburne and Tennyson ; Horace through his Odes, 
and Heine through his Lyrics. Among the American poets we 
should make acquaintance with Longfellow and Lowell, and meet 
with the lesser English (or Dutch) poets, at least in collections and 
anthologies. 
And what of comradeship on the road? With all who are now 
making their way to the City of Happy Childhood we have some 
degree of comradeship, and these, too, form an innumerable com- 
pany. They may teach in the same school with us or in other 
schools, in the same country or in other countries ; they may not 
teach at all. We may meet them daily or very frequently during 
our working days, or infrequently only, during holidays and at 
gatherings of teachers ; we may only hear or read, in the organ 
of our own teachers’ association or in other educational journals, 
in newspapers or in letters, of the work they are doing ; but the 
sense of comradeship will be there and it will make us glad. This 
spiritual comradeship goes farther. In one of his poems (The 
Palace in The Five Nations, Methuen & Co.) Rudyard Kipling tells 
us of ‘a King and a Mason” who, wishing to build a palace, set 
about digging its foundations : 
—Presently, 
under the silt, 
I came on the wreck of a palace such as a King had built. 
There was no worth in the fashion—there was no wit in the plan— 
Hither and thither, aimless, the ruined footings ran— 
Masonry, brute, mishandled, but carven on every stone : 
“ After me cometh a builder. Tell him, I too have known.”
-P-A-G-E-402
    Continuation of Education after Training 389 
He tells them how he took all that he found for his own 
purposes : 
Yet I despised not nor gloried ; yet as we wrenched them apart, 
I read in the razed foundations the heart of the builder’s heart. 
As he had risen and pleaded, so did I understand 
The form of the dream he had followed in the face of the thing he 
had planned. 
These palaces, I think, may stand in a figure for our own work 
of teaching. We take a new class determined to “ build ” well, and 
as soon as we set about laying our foundations we come on the work 
of the teacher who had it before us. We may see ‘no worth in the 
fashion—no wit in the plan” ; but even then, as we make what use 
we can of his fashionings, that seem to us so much less worth than 
our plannings, all that is unsatisfactory in them seems to carry a 
chill warning to us: 
“ After me cometh a Builder. Tell him, I too have known.” 
. and as we go on with our work, meeting our own difficulties, disap- 
pointments and discouragements, we begin to discern more clearly : 
** The form of the dream he had followed in the face of the thing 
he had planned.” 
Then: 
** When I was a King and a Mason—in the open noon of my pride, 
They sent me a Word from the Darkness—They whispered and 
- called me aside. 
» They said—‘ The end is forbidden.’ They said—‘ Thy use is ful- 
filled, 
And thy palace shall stand as that other’s—the spoil of a King who 
shall build.’ ” 
* T called my men from my trenches, my quarries, my wharves, and 
my shears. 
All had wrought I abandoned to the faith of the faithless years. 
Only I cut on the timber, only I carved on the stone : 
* After me cometh a Builder. Tell him, I too have known.’ 
We, too, in the end, are called from the work we began with such 
high hopes of success. We have served our turn; we are n& pér-
-P-A-G-E-403
390 = The School, the Child, and the Teacher 
mitted to finish, and we know that to him who comes after, our 
work will seem as worthless and witless as to us, in our early 
pride, seemed that of him who went before. There is no re- 
sisting, and we make our plans for going; but the thought in 
our heart will speak from our unfinished work, most of which, we 
know, will fall to pieces behind us as did “ that other’s” : 
“ After me cometh a Builder. Tell him, I too have known.” 
The whole poem breathes the spirit of a comradeship of which 
we all have some knowledge, the comradeship of apparent failure, 
and it has in its very sadness the seeds of strength and sympathy. 
So, as we journey along the road our culture may grow and our 
personality develop through the companionship and comradeship 
that may be ours on the way. And the road offers more than these, 
It offers us friendship— the refreshment of green shade ”—which 
should be a further educative influence in our lives. We should 
widen all our social relations as much as possible and deepen one 
friendship. Ruskin tells us that “ the true strength of every human 
soul is to be dependent on as many nobler as it can discern, and to 
be depended upon by as many inferior as it can reach.” We must, 
that is, in the matter of this greatest of benefits, as in all others, 
be ready to give as well as eager to gain. “The only way to 
have a friend is to be one,” for : 
“The end of friendship is a commerce the most strict and homely. 
that can be joined, more strict than any of which we have experience. 
It is for aid and comfort through all the relations and passages of life 
and death. . It is fit for serene days, and graceful gifts, and country 
rambles ; but also for rough roadsand hard fare, shipwreck, poverty 
and persecution.” (Emerson.) 
The road offers, too, wayside flowers for our gathering—the 
smiling looks of children lifted to us in some pause of their work or 
play ; and the noise of running water—the sound of their happy 
laughter. The mountains of endeavour—giving sometimes on the 
shining peaks of success—beckon us, and in our ears beats {rom time 
to time that music of humanity which is as the surge of the sea,

PREFACE 
That the twentieth century is the age of the woman 
and the child is a statement that bids fair to become a 
truism. Yet it is hardly more than a decade or two 
since social writers squarely faced and acknowledged 
this fact, so unprecedented in social history. Such 
tardy recognition is, in part,.an index of the very 
gradual character of the changes which have been tak- 
ing place in the life of womankind during the slow pas- 
sage of many centuries; in part a sign of social indif- 
ference and conservatism. But, be the causes what 
they may, certain it is that in this age of social unrest 
and the heightened social consciousness that accom- 
panies it, when well-nigh every custom and institution 
of society is exposed to the unsparing scrutiny of criti- 
cal minds, women have been thrust into the forefront of 
discussion. The whole vexed question of woman’s 
‘sphere’? and of her education and vocational train- 
ing viewed in the light of that ‘‘sphere’’ has troubled 
the souls of men for more than a generation and is at 
the present time the subject of more or less partisan 
controversy. 
Under such circumstances a study of the present 
transitional period, pregnant as it is with new trends 
and wholly novel points of view, seems not untimely. 
Nevertheless, it is fully recognized that, from the flux 
of existing conditions, in which new forms are con- 
stantly taking shape and old ones are in process of

rapid transformation, it is impossible to draw clearly 
formulated conclusions. The most that the interested 
observer can hope to do is to point out the more crucial 
problems, to present such facts as seem reasonably as- 
sured, to indicate tendencies and to forecast their de- 
sirable outcomes in the light of reflective experience. 
Such is the purpose of the present study which, per- 
haps, loses nothing by the author’s attempt to be 
neither doctrinaire nor conclusive. 
The author’s sincere thanks are due to Professor 
Paul Monroe for the opportunity furnished by him 
for making this study and for the helpful advice and 
comment he has given from time to time. Thanks are 
also owing to the author’s colleagues, Professor 
Edward L. Thorndike and Professor Leta S. Holling- 
worth, for permission to use liberal extracts from 
their books and articles. To the vivifying thought of 
Professor John Dewey the author is profoundly in- 
debted for the educational and social philosophy, from 
the standpoint of which the many-sided problem of 
women’s education has been viewed in this study. 
To the publishers who have generously granted per- 
mission to use extracts from their copyrighted books, 
cordial thanks are due. Especially is the author in- 
debted to The Macmillan Company for their consent

THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
CHAPTER I 
HISTORICAL SKETCH 
At the very outset of human history woman’s pe- 
culiar function was marked out for her. She was des- 
tined by Nature to be the mother of the race—to bear 
and bear again that humanity might perpetuate itself 
in the midst of an inhospitable environment. The grim 
struggle for existence, together with almost continuous 
warfare for hunting grounds, and later for a larger na- 
tional territory, regularly carried off thousands of 
men. Then, too, child mortality was cruelly high in 
primitive society and has so continued down almost to 
the present day, owing to the ignorance of mothers, 
nurses, and physicians of the simplest principles of 
sanitation and child hygiene. Obviously a race so con- 
stantly depleted by death must be renewed as con- 
stantly by birth; therefore of necessity the work o 
women in society centered about the great tasks o 
maternity. 
Now the fact that woman in the past found her s 
yreme social function in bearing and rearing offspri 
had its inevitable effects upon her life. She was t: 
\to her home and its immediate surroundings. N 
her in rude, early times, the stimulating pursuits o 
hunter with their challenge to skill, resourcefulne 
and ingenuity. Not for her the valuable training 
group action gained by the men as fishers with nets

fighting units, as members of the tribal councils. In 
proportion as society advanced, woman’s tasks fell 
more and more within doors. Her duty it was to pre- 
pare food for the members of her family; to see to it 
that her husband and children were clothed and 
warmed ; that the supplies of grain and animal flesh, of 
fruits and vegetables, of wool and flax, furnished by the 
healthy, out-of-door labor of men, were carefully pre- 
served and stored and accounted for. As time passed 
on and warfare led to the development of both a slave- 
~ewning and an enslaved class, the wives of men of prop- 
erty became directors of large retinues of slaves whom 
they trained in the performance of those household 
tasks which the mistresses shared.) Beyond question 
the woman of past generations had enormous economic 
value. Family life, industrial life, and the whole com- 
plex superstructure of social life were dependent upon 
her productive labor. For long centuries industries 
centered wholly in the home; and even after the partial 
breaking down of the domestic system the housewife 
was still an important factor in economic life. And all 
the time she was performing her arduous domestic 
work she was bearing and nursing her offspring and 
tiving the initial bent to their minds and characters. 
It was the biological function of woman, then, that 
rst determined the character of her work in behalf 
the home. And the undeveloped state of industry: 
ether with the crystallization of the folkways are 
nsible for the perpetuation of this domestic sys- 
In course of time sex division of labor came to be 
arded as a divine law—not as a product of social 
ditions. In the confident words of a Greek husband 
ocrates’ day speaking to his girl-wife: ‘‘The gods 
 
-P-A-G-E-15

. .. have plainly adapted the nature of woman for 
works and duties within doors, and that of man for 
works and duties without doors. . . . [Therefore] it 
will certainly be necessary for you to remain at home; 
. and over such as have business to do in the house 
you must exercise a watchful superintendence. What- 
ever is brought into the house you must take charge of 
it; whatever portion of it is required for use you must 
give it out; and whatever should be laid by you must 
take account of it and keep it safe, so that the provi- 
sion stored up for a year, for example, may not be ex- 
pended in a month.’’. And again he says: ‘‘For the 
divinity . . . knowing that he had given the woman by 
nature, and laid upon her, the office of rearing children 
—has also bestowed upon her a greater portion of love 
for her newly-born offspring than on the man.’’ + 
Such was the accepted social doctrine from a period 
long before the age of Ischomachus down to our own 
times. So far as husbands and fathers speculated 
about women at all, they were firmly assured of their 
functions in life—to bear children and to keep house. 
Now if society’s confident belief concerning women’s 
duties had been accompanied by an equally firm as- 
surance of the profound importance and value of these 
activities in the maintenance of social life and the fur- 
therance of its ideal ends, all would have been reason- 
ably well for women. But, unfortunately, this happy 
insight has been restricted, with some notable excep- 
tions, to intelligent men and women of the present day. 
Few men and perhaps fewer women in the past have 
looked upon the functions of the ‘‘weaker sex’’ from 
1 Xenophon, Hconomics, in Monroe’s Source Book in the History of Hdu- 
cation for the Greek and Roman Period, pp. 41-43.

any other standpoint than that of family needs in the 
narrowest sense. Quite generally the family has been 
viewed in detachment from the social whole, rather 
than as an institution in organic relationship with other 
social institutions for the promotion of the best in- 
terests of community life. A man’s home was in a pe- 
culiar sense his individual possession—his castle—and 
its members belonged to him. It is not surprising, then, 
that woman’s work was conceived as domestic in the 
most restricted meaning, i.e., as made up of a round of 
household tasks from baby-tending to candle-making 
which required, it is true, manual skill, devotion, and 
sacrifice of self to the comfort of husband and children, 
but which demanded little social knowledge and insight. 
Furthermore, the constant demand upon men to pro- 
tect their homes and tribal property in time of war 
tended greatly to enhance their prestige at the ex- 
pense of women. Giving birth to children was an un- 
dramatic affair taken as a matter of course; whereas 
defense of hunting and fishing grounds against the sur- 
prise attacks of marauding tribes required conspicuous 
bravery and endurance on the part of all the males of 
the group and was both thrilling and spectacular. 
Without such united action the tribe could not have 
survived but would have been reduced to slavery or 
serfdom. It followed that the protection of the tribe 
was, from the first, rated far higher than_ its 
perpetuation. 
Since woman’s environment was narrowly personal, 
it is small wonder that her nature responded to the 
selected stimuli daily brought to bear upon it, and 
that she failed to develop in any marked degree those 
social qualities so highly esteemed by civilized men.
-P-A-G-E-17
HISTORICAL SKETCH i 
Such intellectual attributes as accuracy and breadth 
of thinking, together with such indispensable social 
traits as the spirit of group codperation, group fair 
play, and willing obedience to group law, even when it 
pinches the individual, were not conspicuous in most 
women of the past, whatever other admirable charac- 
teristics they unquestionably possessed. Inviolable 
chastity and absolute devotion to the well-being of 
every member of her family, from her husband to her 
newest baby, were the virtues men supremely valued in 
a woman; and it is hardly necessary to point out that 
these virtues might easily coexist with a selfish and in- 
dividualistic spirit toward the community at large. 
‘When any human being’s powers are detached from a 
broad, social setting and are required to develop in a 
limited personal field, they reveal the cramping effects 
of the restrictions that have been imposed upon them. 
And women have proved no exception to the a 
  rule. oo 
In consequence, men, viewing ‘‘with a scornful won- 
der’’ the ‘‘female’’ thus shaped by social circumstance 
very early reached the conclusion that women were in- 
ferior to themselves in all the higher intellectual, social, 
and moral qualities. Therefore they argued that 
women must be kept in strict subordination to fathers 
and husbands and rarely, if ever, allowed to taste a 
liberty which they would surely abuse. The ideal of ideal of 
womanhood through the ages ha has been. aS

mind, and with unlimi _self-immolation. 
Tt Followed th that education of an intellectual sort played 
but a small part in woman’s life. Such training as she

received, with few exceptions, was rigidly limited to 
deportment and domestic industries, with some relig- 
ious and moral instruction of a strongly dogmatic 
flavor, designed to reinforce established ideas and cus- 
toms. Quite naturally it has resulted that women have 
been among the most powerful conservative forces in 
social life: The classic example of this fact is seen in 
India, where the bitter hostility shown by the huge 
mass of uneducated Hindu women toward any change 
in hide-bound customs hangs like a dead weight round 
the necks of the more progressive men. Likewise a 
study of the history of Western nations, up almost to 
the nineteenth century, would show that few women 
have been found upon the side of reforms in religion, 
politics, education, or social usage. Until very re- 
cently theirs has been the broad, well-travelled road 
of established folkways and traditional ideas. 
During the last decades of the eighteenth century the 
first telling blows were struck at this rigid social sys- 
tem. With the substitution of machinery for hand- 
work, with the concentration of labor in towns and fac- 
tories, and, above all, with the entrance of women into 
industrial life outside their own homes, the transfor- 
mation of woman’s life begam For when women be- 
came regular wage-earners ard steady contributors to 
the family income they took the first long strides to- 
ward economic independence. During the nineteenth 
century England and most of the States of America 
began to enact legislation which gave to married 
women not only the absolute ownership of their wages 
but also of their real and personal property acquired 
before marriage. Such legislation has proved, in the 
event, little short of revolutionary. For it meant, of
-P-A-G-E-19
  HISTORICAL SKETCH 9 
course, that women, whether married or in the position 
of femmes soles, were released in large part from that 
age-long financial dependence upon men which, more 
than any other contributory cause, had been responsi- 
ble for their social and intellectual subordination. 
Together with this economic emancipation of wives 
and mothers went other privileges of a legal nature. 
To married women were granted rights of contract and 
suit together with the right to will away real and per- 
sonal property—privileges denied them since the ' 
Middle Ages. All of which signified that the law now 
took cognizance of married women as legal personali- 
ties, apart from their husbands; so that they might, 
almost for the first time in the recorded history of Eng- 
land and America, carry cases into the courts in their 
own names. Judge Blackstone’s oft-quoted saying in 
his Commentaries—‘‘Husband and wife are one, and 
the husband is the one’’—no longer was valid in the 
legal world of England and most of the United States.* 
Other forces were at work to bring about a broad- 
ening of woman’s social and intellectual horizon. In 
France, England, and America were being hewn out 
those principles of democracy which, at first applicable 
only to men and then solely in the realm of politics, 
were to receive broader and broader interpretation as 
the generations advanced. Our forefathers could not 
go on preaching the doctrines of liberty and equality 
without, in course of time, coming to see their 
1The first English law granting married women control of wages and a 
very limited control of personal (not real) property was passed in 1870. 
A later enactment in 1882 gave them absolute ownership of all real and 
personal property with legal rights of suit and contract. America began en- 
acting such laws prior to the Civil War, but, owing to the fact that power 
to enact such legislation is the right of the several States, it happens that 
in a few States of the Union married women are still in a position of 
partial economic and legal dependence.

application to their daughters as to their sons. Doubt- 
less this recognition was hastened by the industrial 
changes mentioned above with their profound reactions 
upon women’s lives. “The planting of the eighteenth 
eentury was harvested during the nineteenth, when a 
more-generous spirit with respect to the intellectual 
training of womankind tended to prevail in Hurope 
cand America: Before the middle of the century unmis- 
takable signs of dissatisfaction with the spineless type 
of education then in vogue for girls were not-lacking. 
The boarding and ‘‘finishing’’ schools of England and 
America seemed signally to have failed to develop 
young women with a thorough knowledge of any sub- 
ject whatever, or with an intelligent interest.in the live 
problems of socicty beyond their own doorstep or 
neighborhood. /With some notable exceptions, these 
schools were turning out ‘‘females’’ of the eighteenth 
century genre, deplorably deficient in powers of 
straight, hard thinking, unbiased judgment, and emo- 
tional control, but skilled in the popular ‘‘accomplish- 
ments’’-of dancing, piano-playing, tambour work, and 
marvellous landscape effects in wool or paint. Thus 
polished off, these young women were returned to their 
homes at sixteen or thereabouts to carry on, under 
their mothers’ instruction, a daily round of house- 
wifely and social arts designed to ‘‘complete’’ their 
education and secure for them the husband and the 
‘‘home of their own’’ that constituted the only proper 
goal of a self-respecting girl. Not to marry was to be 
a supreme failure, to have lost the one thing worth 
hile, the one respectable vocation, other than teach- 
_ ing, then-open to women. Listen to Jane Austen, 
describing with inimitably ironic humor the crowning

affair in the life of an Englishwoman little more than 
a century ago—the capture of a husband! Charlotte 
Lucas, aged twenty-seven, has just announced to her 
family her engagement to Mr. Collins :— 
“The whole family . . . were properly overjoyed on the occasion. 
The younger girls formed hopes of coming out a-year or two sooner 
than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved from 
their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte her- 
self was tolerably.composed. She had gained her point, and had 
time to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. 
Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither amiable nor agreeable; his 
society was irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. 
But still he would be her husband. Without thinking highly either 
of men or of matrimony, marriage had always been her object; it 
was the only honorable provision for well-educated young women 
of small fortune, and, however uncertain of giving happiness, must 
be their pleasantest preservative from want. This preservative she 
had now obtained; and at the age of twenty-seven, without having 
ever been handsome, she felt all the good luck of it.” * 
As late as 1849 Charlote Bronté wrote feelingly on 
the same question—still a very live one in England: 
“Believe me, teachers may be hard-worked, ill-paid and despised, 
but the girl who stays at home doing nothing is worse off than the 
hardest wrought and worst-paid drudge of a school. Whenever I 
have seen, not merely in humble but in affluent homes, families of 
daughters sitting waiting to be married, I have pitied them from 
my heart.” 
Let it not be imagined that wholly different ideas re- 
garding woman’s sphere and education were prevalent 
in the American colonies. Here, as in the mother coun- 
try, marriage was well-nigh the only reputable vocation 
for a woman who shrank from occupying for life the 
coldest corner at the hearth of some grudging relative. 
Therefore the education of girls was pretty strictly

limited to religious and moral instruction and training 
in domestic duties. 
The general attitude of the colonies toward this ques- 
tion is quaintly expressed in an old-time children’s 
book, the Catechism of Health, which sets colonial 
girls in their proper places: 
“Qurry: Ought female children to receive the same education 
as boys and have the same scope for play? 
“Answer: In their earlier years there should be no difference. 
But there are shades of discretion and regards to propriety 
“ which judicious and prudent guardians and teachers can discern 
92 sand can adjust and apply.’ 
Doubtless the ‘‘shades of discretion and regards to 
propriety’’ exercised their due influence upon the edu- 
cation of colonial girls, for we find Abigail Adams writ- 
ing her husband in 1778: 
“But in this country, you need not be told how much female educa- 
tion is neglected, nor how fashionable it has been to ridicule female 
learning; though I acknowledge it my happiness to be connected 
with a person of a more generous mind and liberal sentiments.” 
In 1817 the same gifted lady writes of her own early 
education : 
“T never was sent to any school. ... Female education in the 
best families went no further than writing and arithmetic, in some 
few’and rare instances, music and drawing.” ? 
/ But the dawn of a new order was at hand in both 
England and America. Toward the middle of the nine- 
teenth century a novel type of higher school for girls 
appeared in England, with a course of study relatively 
broad and thorough, promising much for the future.

To this period belong Queen’s College (1848) and Bed- 
ford College (1849) in London; Mary Buss’s school for 
girls in Camden; and the excellent higher girls’ school” 
at Cheltenham, of which Dorothea Beale became the 
gifted head in 1858. Owing to the energy and initiative 
of Emily Davies, the Schools Inquiry Commission, 
appointed by Parliament in 1865, graciously con- 
sented to include girls’ schools in their critical sur- 
vey. The Report of this Commission, issued in 1868, 
included a detailed and scathing indictment of. the 
so-called ‘‘higher’’ schools for girls in England with 
urgent recommendations for their reorganization and 
endowment. 
__-From the time of the publication of this influential 
Report the reform of girls’ education in England pro- 
ceeded rapidly. New schools were founded and en- 
dowed; and the standards in all secondary girls’ 
schools were raised by the establishment of examining 
boards at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, 
which granted lower and higher certificates to girls 
qualified to pass their thorough examinations. Most 
significant, perhaps, were the efforts of the women of 
England to initiate reforms. Now thoroughly aroused 
to the intellectual needs of their sex, they organized 
associations throughout the country for promoting the 
higher education of young women. The most widely 
influential of these organizations was the National 
Union for Improving the Education of Women. Not 
content with oral propaganda, this association pub- 
lished a Journal setting forth the deficiencies in the 
present system. It further assisted in the organiza- 
tion of the Girls’ Public Day School Society in 1872— 
an organization” which has had tremendous influence in  
-P-A-G-E-24
14 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
shaping the secondary education of English girls of 
the middle class. 
“But this was not all. The crying need for well-' 
trained teachers in the new schools led Emily Davies, \ 
Mary Buss, Anne Clough, and others to labor enthusi- 
astically to secure the advantages of university educa- 
tion to women. Their efforts resulted in the opening 
of the Cambridge and Oxford University examinations 
to qualified women and to the establishment at Cam- 
_bridge of the two leading Hnglish colleges for women 
“Girton, incorporated~in 1872; and» Newnham incor- 
porated eight years later. At Oxford four halls for 
women were opened a little later—Somerville, Lady 
Margaret, St. Hugh’s, and St. Hilda’s—all of. which 
have now been chartered as colleges. 
Following hard upén these reforms came the opening 
of England’s provincial universities to women; and at 
the present time Liondon, Leeds; Manchester, Bristol, 
Durham, and Birmingham admit women to full univer- 
sity privileges, including the courses in medicine and 
law. The Scottish, Welsh, and Irish universities have 
done likewise. 
But it should not be inferred that every obstacle to 
the university and professional training of the women 
of England has been overcome and that all the doors 
of educational and professional opportunity swing 
open to them freely and smoothly. Although Oxford 
in 1920 abandoned its fixed policy of refusing degrees 
to women—no matter how thoroughly prepared—Cam- 
bridge has up to the present refused to depart from 
ancient precedent. Until now Cambridge has likewise 
denied to women the honorary titles won by them in 
the honérs examinations. Thus, in 1890 a Newnham

student attained highest rank in the mathematical tri- 
pos.t' By ancient custom the proud winner of this in- 
tellectual distinction is called the Senior Wrangler. But 
in this instance the title was conferred on the man next 
lower in rank solely on the ground of there being no 
precedent at Cambridge for bestowing such an honor 
ona woman. The terse warning of Dr. Goldwin Smith, 
uttered with true Johnsonian dignity to the dons of 
Oxford, admirably expressed the sentiment of many 
university men when confronted with the demands of 
women for more equal privileges: ‘‘You are in the 
face of a revolt against the limitations of sex.’’ 
Nor has the attitude of England’s professional men, 
with respect to the admission of women to the practice 
of law and medicine, been more enlightened. The strug- 
gles of women in 1869 to obtain medical training at 
Edinburgh University make interesting reading in 
these strenuous times when women physicians during 
the World War were staffing great British hospitals 
at home and proving their worth in army hospitals be- 
hind the front.“ For many years after medical degrees 
had been conferred upon English women, they were 
excluded from the Obstetrical Society and from all 
other medical associations in Great Britain. Until 
1920 women had knocked in vain at the fast closed 
doors of the legal profession. Sir Joshua Fitch voiced 
the feeling of many Englishmen when he wrote in the 
Victoria Magazine: 
“Tf women ask for a system of mixed education, for admission to 
academic lectures, to the Bar, to the Church or the Legislature, the 
reply to such demands would be very simple. We cannot imperil 
the social order.”

What a shock would that honorable gentleman have 
experienced could he have seen his countrywomen, dur- 
ing the world conflict just past, putting their shoulders 
to the nation’s wheel in a magnificent endeavor to pre- 
serve that social order which he charged them with 
seeking to overthrow! 
Yet, although much has been accomplished, much re- 
mains to be done before equality of opportunity and 
reward becomes a reality for England’s women. Writ- 
ing in 1917 Mrs. Fawcett, long a leader in the move- 
ment to secure better educational and professional 
advantages to Englishwomen, has pointed out the de- 
fects in the present system: 
“Thousands of women to-day are born free’; but it was at a 
great price that the pioneers had to buy their freedom. 
“And to-day their freedom is by no means complete. They have 
won their way into one great and splendid profession (medicine) ; 
but nearly every other profession is still closed to them in this 
country. Important educational posts are open to them; they have 
themselves created a new profession in nursing, but both branches 
of the law are banged, barred, and bolted against them. No woman 
ean become a chartered accountant, or take Holy Orders, nor is 
there any authorized channel by which woman can enter upon the 
higher posts of responsibility in the Civil Service. . . . There is no 
waste as great as the waste of the powers and gifts of the human 
beings who make up the nation. Let us resolve to make an end 
Of it? * 
An end was made of it, in law at least, by the pas- 
sage of the Sex Disqualification Act (1920) making 
women eligible to the legal profession and to the office 
of magistrate. Also by this Act women may become 
chartered accountants.

  It ‘vould be pleasant to record that young America — 
was far in advance of the mother-country in according 
a liberal education to its daughters. But such does 
not appear to be the case, although reforms began 
somewhat earlier in the United States than in England. Le 
The first indication of a more liberal spirit toward the 
education of girls was shown by the opening of the 
town schools of New England to them after the Revo- 
lutionary War. Then came the age of the academy and 
the ‘‘female seminary’’—schools_where our grand- 
mothers were taught Latin, French, mathematics, his- 
tory, geography, and a. “smattering of book science. 
These institutions were the successors of the boarding 
and ‘‘finishing’’ schools, imported f from England “with 
other artificialities during the eighteenth.century. In 
justice it must be said that-they-gave-opportunity for a 
far_more thorough education than-wasfurnished by. 
the earlier schools, since they were much less domi-__ 
nated by the prevailing ideal _of ‘‘female accomplish- 
ments.?? 
Prominent among the more advanced of these inate 
were the seminary founded at Troy, New York, in 1821 
by Emma Willard and that organized in Hartford, Con- 
necticut, a year later by Catherine Beecher. These two 
path-finders, fired by the vision of a new liberal educa- 
tion for women which should make them not only more 
intelligent s and mothers but more skillful teachers 
in the valid rowing schools, laid the foundations of 
that splendid educational structure which Mary Lyon, 
Alice Freeman Palmer, Ellen Richards, and other far- 
sighted women reared in later years. No one can un- 
derstand the history of the education of American 
women, nor dimly appreciate the difficulties met and

overcome by its builders, who is not familiar with the 
aspirations, the struggles, and the triumphs of these 
leading women. All honor to these enthusiastic and 
patient pioneers, but especially, perhaps, to Emma Wil- 
lard whose vision seems widest of them all. She it was 
who saw to the heart of the whole difficult question of 
| girls’ education in her day and made plain to others its 
fundamental defect. In her famous Address .. . to 
the Members of the Legislature of New York Propos- 
ing a Plan for Improving Female Education, published 
in 1819, Mrs. Willard declared in ringing terms that in 
the existing custom of civilized nations ‘‘female educa- 
tion has been left to the mercy of private adventurers ; 
and the consequence has been to our sex, the same as it 
would have been to the other, had legislatures left their 
accommodations and means of instruction to chance 
also.’’ Girls’ schools of that day were characterized as 
“temporary institutions, formed by individuals, whose 
object is present aitice Neither the accommo- 
dations as to rooms and libraries nor the instruction 
afforded were suitable to the needs of young women. 
Moreover, it ‘‘is for the interest of instructresses of 
boarding schools to teach their pupils showy accom- 
plishments, rather than those which are solid and use- 
ful. ... Any woman has a right to open a school in 
any place; and no one, either from law or custom, can 
prevent her. Hence the public are liable to be imposed 
upon, both with respect to the character and acquire- 
ments of preceptresses.’’? With clear insight Mrs. Wil- 
lard pointed out that the ‘‘great cause of these defects 
consists in a state of things in which legislatures, un- 
dervaluing the importance of women in society, neglect 
to provide for their education and suffer it to become
-P-A-G-E-29
HISTORICAL SKETCH 19 
the sport of adventurers for fortune, who may be both 
ignorant and vicious.’? The remedy for these evils lies 
in frank recognition of the principle that it ‘‘is the 
duty of our present legislators to begin now to form the 
characters of the next generation, by controlling that 
of the females, who are to be their mothers, while it is 
yet with them a season of improvement.’’- 
Mrs. Willard then proceeded to outline her plan for 
a ‘‘Female Seminary’’ properly housed and equipped 
with apparatus and a library, in which solid instruction 
would be given under the four heads of Religious and 
Moral, Literary, Domestic, and Ornamental education. 
Under the last heading were included drawing and 
painting, music and dancing. Such seminaries, she de- 
celared, ‘‘would constitute a grade of public education, 
superior to any yet known in the history of our sex; 
and through them, the lower grades of female instruc- 
tion might be controlled. The influence of public semi- 
naries, over these, would operate in two ways, first, by 
requiring certain qualifications for entrance; and sec- 
ondly, by furnishing instructresses, initiated in their nr, 
modes of teaching, and imbued with their maxims.’ * Se = 
This vigorous petition was deserving of better re- 
sults than it achieved. To be sure, the New York Legis- 
lature showed a moderate approval of Mrs. Willard’s 
Plan by an act incorporating her school at Waterford 
as an academy entitled to a share of the state ‘‘litera- 
ture fund.’’? Thé following year (1820) Governor Clin- 
ton, a warm advocate of the reforms championed by 
Mrs. Willard, called the attention of the legislature to 
the seminary at Waterford, which had ‘‘already at- 
tained great usefulness and prosperity,’’ and declared 
1 Address, pp. 1-46, (ed. 1819).
-P-A-G-E-30
  20 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
that it represented ‘‘the only attempt ever made in this 
country to promote the education of the female sex by 
the patronage of government... .’’ In view of the, 
importance to the home of elevating the ‘‘female char- 
acter’’ the Governor urged the Legislature to extend 
its ‘‘munificence to this meritorious institution.’’ The 
Senate responded to this appeal by granting the new 
academy $2,000; but unfortunately the bill failed in the 
House. Moreover, the Regents of the State University 
decided that the school could no longer share in the 
literature fund. This decision was a tremendous blow 
to Mrs. Willard, especially as the expenses of her semi- 
nary at Waterford were outstripping its income. 
Therefore in 1821 the school was removed to Troy on 
the invitation of its citizens. The city corporation 
agreed to provide the building and land, and later ap- 
propriated to the use of the school a plot of ground 
valued at $2,000. Here was established the famous 
Troy Female Seminary which, after an honorable his- 
tory of a century still ministers to the education of 
girls under its new name of the Emma Willard School. 
So influential did the older school become that it is 
said to have furnished the inspiration for well-nigh 
two hundred seminaries patterned after it. 
Not content with her work at Troy, Emma Willard 
wrote improved text-books for girls’ schools, which had 
an enormous circulation, made addresses in her own 
country and abroad for the advancement of women’s 
education, and joined with Henry Barnard in his vig- 
orous campaign for the improvement of the public 
schools of Connecticut. No wonder an enthusiastic 
biographer says of her that she was ‘‘pre-eminently a 
Representative Woman, who suitably typifies the great
-P-A-G-E-31
HISTORICAL SKETCH 21 
movement of the nineteenth century for the elevation of 
woman.’’* 
Almost from the beginning of their educational ca- 
reers, the serious national need for a better educated 
and trained teaching corps had been vigorously 
preached by Emma Willard and Catherine Beecher. 
Both of these leaders had bent their most earnest ef- 
forts to the upbuilding of public sentiment and con- 
science with respect to this question; and both had 
labored to train a body of efficient teachers in the semi- 
naries they had established. {In Massachusetts the 
project was taken up by Messrs. Carter, Brooks, and 
Horace Mann who carried forward a campaign of pub- 
lic enlightenment which resulted in the founding in‘ 
that state of the first two normal schools in the country 
in 1839. Yet, despite the urgent need for such schools, 
they/spread very slowly and most of the work of pre- 
\ paring the country’s teachers fell upon the seminaries 
and academies. Up to the outbreak of the Civil War 
scarcely more than fourteen normal schools had been 
established.2, However, their growth since 1865 has 
been very rapid. In the Report of the Commissioner of 
Education for 1917 there were listed 234 public normal 
schools and 45 private. Almost from their foundation 
these institutions have educated more women than 
men, and for many years they have been overwhelm- 
ingly professional schools for women.f Witness. the fig- 
ures of the Commissioner’s Report fdr 1917 which show 
2,941 male graduates-and-20,496-female! 5

Republic as ne to threaten the time-honored con- 
ceptions of the education proper to a ‘‘female.’’ Not 
only were academies for girls springing up everywhere, 
but a demand was developing, here and there, for a new 
type of secondary school which should be wholly under 
public control and supported by public funds. The 
academies for girls were usually not free institutions; 
moreover, many girls had to leave their homes to at- 
tend them, which meant an added expense for board 
and lodging. \New York and Boston were the first cities 
to meet the new demand by establishing public high 
schools for girls in the same year—1826. _Unfortu- 
| nately these promising ventures came to an untoward 
end. The Boston school was fairly swamped with girls 
¢ eager for knowledge; indeed it appears to have been 
\. such an ‘‘alarming success’’ that the school authori- 
ties were dismayed at the prospect of large outlays for 
the school. In spite of a sharp rise in the qualifications 
demanded of the girls for entrance to the new High 
School, Mayor Quincy says of the pupils: ‘‘Not one 
voluntarily quitted it, and there was no reason to sup- 
pose that anyone admitted to the school would volun- 
tarily quit for the whole three years, except in case of 
marriage.’’ \So the school was closed, after a trial of 
eighteen months, because the community was not pre- 
pared to meet the expense of so popular and growing 
an institution! 4 
The New York school was likewise abandoned in 
1828 after a building had been erected and equipped at 
“a cost of $20,300, and several ‘‘female instructors’’ 
engaged. In the Memoirs of John Griscom, one of the 
trustees of the New York Girls’ High School, we gain 
light as to the cause of its abandonment. The writer

i eet oe It is interesting to note that for 
forty yéars or more the enrollment of girls in American HISTORICAL SKETCH 23 
tells us that the school ‘‘lacked from the beginning an 
efficient head, who had a primary interest in its con- 
tinued prosperity. The lady placed in it as principal 
was chiefly remarkable for her skill in flower paint- 
ing.’’ A delightful comment on the educational sys- 
tem that had produced this able lady! { 
Despite these unpropitious beginnings, however, 
other attempts were soon made to establish high 
schools at public expense.) From the first, girls were 
admitted, although they were often sequestered in a 
separate wing of the building, or, as in the case of Bos- 
ton, New York, Baltimore, and a few other eastern 
cities, were provided with separate buildings} But 
questions of economy as well as the growth of a healthy 
sentiment in favor of the education of boys and girls in 
common have combined to make the United States one 
of the most advanced exponents of coeducation in 
modern times. The new secondary schools spread 
rapidly and grew in public favor after the Civil War.

girls; and in 1917-18 the percentage of girls was more 
than 57. + 
But the steadily growing American scatiment in 
favor of the education of girls did not stop with the 
establishment of public secondary schools. Even be-

ageous souls to secure for young women the benefits of 
higher education so long enjoyed by their brothers. 
So-called “colleges”? for women sprang up like mush- 
{ ‘room growths in the South and the Middle West during 
\ the decades preceding 1860. Unfortunately existing 
records show that many of these aspiring institutions 
*\ were little, if at all, more advanced in standards and 
“courses of study than the better type of ‘‘female semi- 
naries.’’ Three or four of these ‘‘colleges’’ in the 
South make emphatic claims to be each the first real in- 
stitution of collegiate rank granting degrees to women 
in America or in the world. Such are the claims of 
Elizabeth College, chartered in New Washington, Mis- 
~Sissippi, in 1819; of the Georgia Female College in 
Macon, Georgia, established in 1836; and of the Mary 
Sharp College in Winchester, Tennessee (1851). Ex- © 
President Taylor of Vassar College, after patiently ex- 
amining such evidence as still exists in the form of 
prospectuses and printed curricula, gives it as his con- 
clusion that none of these higher schools was doing a 
grade of work approximate to that of Harvard, Yale, 
or Princeton. 
More hopeful as the herald of a new order was the 
foundation of Oberlin Collegiate Institute (1833), later 
chartered as Oberlin College, an institution of full col- 
legiate rank to which women were admitted as candi- 
\\ dates for degrees from the beginning of its history- 
~The melancholy truth must be recorded, however, that 
the new college offered a much diluted and abridged 
‘ladies’ course’’ to young women as an alternative to 
the more advanced course leading to a degree; and 
many fair students appear to have preferred the less

strenuous path to learning. In 1856-7, twenty-three 
years after the establishment of the college, 229 women 
students were taking /the ‘‘ladies’ course’’ and only 20 
the degree courses Other institutions in the North 
offering work of college grade to women were Antioch, 
a coeducational college founded in 1853, and Elmira 
College, chartered in 1855 with the express purpose 
of affording to young women an advanced education © 
no whit inferior to that which their brothers received 
in the older colleges of the Hast. Unfortunately for the 
worthy ambitions of its founders, however, the funds at 
the disposal of this first ‘‘real College’? for women 
were insufficient to maintain the standards set up at 
the outset of its history. Therefore, in a very true 
sense, Vassar College, chartered in 1861, opened in 
1865 at the close of the Civil War, may be awarded the 
distinction of being the ‘‘oldest of the well equipped 
and amply endowed colleges for women in the United 
States.’’ (Beyo: doubt Vassar was a pioneer in the 
collegiate educationef women; for the high standards 
‘it raised in respect to academic and physical training, 
to college equipment and te the solid scholarship of its 
faculty, it has never loweréd.1_ Thus it became to a 
large extent a model for the women’s colleges which 
succeeded it.} 
Priér to 1860 two state universities, Utah and Iowa, 
had thrown open their doors to women; but it was not 
until the period of national optimism and reconstruc- 
tion that followed upon the Civil War that one state 
university after another admitted young women to full 
membership and unrestricted privileges. At the pres- 
ent time only one state university—Virginia—still re-

fuses to grant approximately equal opportunities to 
women. However, in 1920 the Rector and Visitors of 
this famous university voted to offer ‘‘to women of 
maturity and adequate preparation opportunity in the 
College for specialized training and for graduation 
with a vocational baccalaureate degree in Chemistry, 
Biology, other laboratory sciences, and Architecture 
» and Commerce. In the Department of Graduate 
Studies opportunity is also offered to pursue courses 
Y leading to the degree of Master of Arts, Master of 
Science, and Doctor of Philosophy. In the field of 
oe professional training, work is offered resulting in 
; graduation with a professional degree in the Depart- 
_~ ments of Education, Engineering, Law, and Medicine.“ 
: The very rapid increase in enrollment of women stu- — 
dents at colleges and coeducational universities for the 
twenty-year period 1890-1910 is shown in the Report 
\ of the Commissioner of Education for 1910, In 
women’s colleges the rate of increase was 348.4 per 
cent, while in coeducational institutions the rate was 
even higher—438 per cent. This enormous growth is 
) all the more remarkable when compared with the cor- 
responding rate of increase for men during the same 
\ period, which was 214.2 per cent. In the year 1890 the 
, percentage of men and women college students in the 
\\ United States was respectively 68.3 and 31.7. But in 
‘ 1917-18 the Bureau reports that 14,481 first and gradu- 
, ate degrees were conferred on women and 17,007 on 
S men; which means that 46 per cent. of all the graduates 
» in that year were women. Of course these figures are 
~ misleading since this was the year in which the United 
States entered the war. If we take the percentages of 
men and women students in 1915-16 we find them to be 
df 5

HISTORICAL SKETCH 27 
respectively 64.4 and 35.6. Probably America has 
realized more thoroughly than any other civilized coun- 
try the vital importance to the well-being of a nation of 
a trained and enlightened womanhood. Yet it can 
hardly be maintained that the American people even 
to-day are as whole-heartedly committed to the policy 
of the higher and professional education of their young 
women as they are to that of men. The Report of the 
Commissioner of Education already cited gives some 
interesting figures concerning the gifts and bequests 
made to 27 institutions during 1909-10. Of these Yale, 
Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia universities re- 
ceived amounts aggregating $6,216,033; while the only 
two. women’s colleges listed, Bryn Mawr and Wellesley, 
received respectively $707,475 and $173,473. Again, 
.in 1915-16 five universities for men (Yale, Harvard, 
Princeton, Pennsylvania, and Columbia) received gifts 
amounting to $6,700,601; while five colleges for women 
(Smith, Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Wellesley and 
Goucher) received bequests totalling $1,711,315.1 
Such disparities exist in part, of course, because the 
alumni of men’s universities are more numerous and 
financially more able to help their Alma Maters than 
are the alumne of women’s colleges; but another cause 
may be found in the fact that wealthy American citi- 
zens are not yet so actively interested in the higher 
education of women as in that of men. 
Far more apparent is this half-hearted and doubtful 
attitude when the question of training women for the 
historic professions is under consideration. Although

delphia in 1850, and although many of the best medical 
schools in the country now offer training to women, 
it yet remains true that the age-old prejudice against 
the practice of medicine by women has by no means 
wholly broken down in America. Evidences of this fact 
may be found not alone in the refusal of a few of the 
finest medical schools to receive women, but also in the 
reluctance of hospitals to appoint women as internes 
and to afford them ample opportunities for clinical 
practice. This condition is responsible in large meas- 
ure for the slow increase in the number of women in the 
medical schools of the United States. In 1912-13 there 
were only 835 women students in schools of medicine; 
and this small number showed an actual decrease in 
1917-18, when the total number of women students was 
only 643.1 Not much more encouraging are the reports 
concerning the entrance of women into the professions 
of law and theology. In 1912-13 only 372 women were 
enrolled in schools of law, and 449 in theological 
schools.? In 1917-18 the number of women studying 
law had increased to 822 and the number studying in 
schools of theology to 780.3 Clearly there is no very 
strong movement of women toward the so-called higher 
professions, doubtless because of the very obstinate 
prejudices to be overcome before a woman can estab- 
lish a successful practice. 
The foregoing historical sketch, brief and incomplete 
though it may be, may nevertheless serve to show how 
far modern nations have advanced beyond the age 
when woman’s realm was everywhere believed to lie

solely in the domestic circle and her education to con- 
sist in the mere ability to read, write, and keep ac- 
counts, with a smattering of ‘‘accomplishments”’ as a 
lure for a prospective husband. Instead of being a 
neatly ticketed specimen in a rigidly classified social 
system, woman has become to many thoughtful persons 
a somewhat baffling, if not an irritating, enigma. Her 
economic and legal emancipation, together with the 
liberation of her mind have resulted in producing a 
perplexing array of problems concerning her real 
functions in the modern social world. _ 
It is idle to deny that many women to-day are becom- 
ing dissatisfied with the restricted sphere which so 
‘long has been theirs, and this holds true almost in pro- 
portion to the extent of their higher education and pro- 
fessional training. Even among that large body of 
women whose homing and maternal instincts are very 
strong, there is much restlessness and dissatisfaction 
with the state of ‘‘enthroned domesticity,’’ as it has 
been so long interpreted and enforced by public opin- 
ion. Deplore this unsettled condition as some of us 
may, it seems rather futile to refuse to face the sit- 
uation in the vain hope that it may be transitory. The 
old order, wherein maidens stayed at home waiting for 
marriage, and matrons moved with complete absorp- 
tion through a daily round of domestic tasks, is on the 
* way to becoming as dead as the ancien régime. A few 
years ago an enthusiastic educator described the pres- 
ent situation in the following words: 
“A century ago Madame de Stael ventured to say that genius 
knows no sex; we have reached a more memorable truth, that work, 
no matter what its quality, knows no sex. Women have achieved 
education, the key of liberation, the tool of talent, and all careers

are open. In the United States there are eight million women in 
gainful occupations, and the number grows. In the higher activities 
of mankind, women have won indisputable recognition. 
“In 1850 there was not, in the United States, I believe, a woman 
lawyer, journalist, physician, architect, librarian. Now women plead 
before the Supreme Court, they are twelve per cent. of the newspaper 
force, they practice medicine in every city of the Union and archi- 
tecture in the great cities; they are two-thirds of the library force , 
of our twelve hundred public libraries. 
“Sixty years ago there were no trained nurses. To-day trained 
nurses, eighty thousand or more, make our hospitals possible, and 
they are finding a place in our schools and factories. Our whole 
public school system, with its infinite potentialities, rests on the 
work of five hundred thousand women; education has become a 
small body of men entirely surrounded by women... . 
“Everything is incredible, impossible till someone does it. Wom- 
en’s ability in the creative arts was once an incredible thing; it is a 
commonplace to-day, in poetry, fiction, painting, and sculpture. 
‘Women’s ability in science was once an incredible thing, but we have 
the recorded achievement of the highest quality of Eleanor Ormerod 
in entomology and Mme. Curie in physics and chemistry—the latter 
the only scientist so far twice honored by the Nobel Prize (1903, 
1911). In the field of mechanics, no one claimed for women any 
ability whatsoever. . . . In the 1860’s women took out over forty 
patents a year; in the 1880’s over one hundred a year, in the 1890’s 
one a day, and by 1910 they had 8,596 patents to their credit—in a 
field where nothing whatever was expected of them. 
“The world war has destroyed the last traditional limitations on 
the work of women. They can fairly claim now what was only a 
half truth when the phrase arose, ‘les carriéres ouverts aux talents” ” 
If this vivid picture be accepted as true to the facts 
in its main outlines we are clearly confronted with some 
puzzling questions. Are the higher education and the 
professional training of women unfitting them for 
marriage and motherhood? Is such education to result

in the production of a type of woman more interested 
in her chosen life work than in giving life to a new 
generation? Is the maintenance of the race to be left 
more and more to the women of the laboring classes, 
whose educational and economic opportunities have 
hitherto been so meagre as to breed in them no aspira- 
tions for a larger sphere of activity and achievement 
than the home in its more limited sense? And shall 
society accept without counteracting efforts the exist- 
ence in its midst of a growing body of highly educated 
women, keen and capable of intellect, skilled in some 
useful social work but biologically sterile? Finally 
does this condition result in a eugenic loss to the com- 
munity and the nation which is not wholly compensated 
for by the valuable services of these women?

  CHAPTER II 
COLLEGE WOMEN AND THE MARRIAGE 
RATE 
Some Statistical Studies.—‘‘Is the woman’s college 
as now conducted a force which acts against the sur- 
vival of the race which patronizes it? Whatever in- 
tellectual and moral superiority a race may have, it 
needs also a certain amount of reproductive impulse 
in order to remain on the earth. No culture, art, sci- 
ence, or morality can save it unless it produces about 
three matured children per married, child-bearing 
couple, and any race which does not do this is doomed 
to extinction.’’ : 
Thus writes an alarmed contributor to the Journal 
of Heredity; and he follows this dark prophecy with 
the statement: ‘‘Women are the capital of the race. 
The farmer that uses his land for golf-links and deer 
preserves instead of for crops has but one agricultural 
fate; so the civilization that uses its women for stenog- 
raphers, clerks, and school-teachers instead of mothers 
has but one racial fate.’’ + 
It may possibly be objected by some captious read- 
ers that in these statements the author appears to 
regard woman as a sort of racial slave. But, setting 
aside the objection, it may pertinently be asked what 
are the writer’s grounds for concluding that college °

women ‘‘are not greatly sought after as mates, to’share 
in the work of getting a living and founding a fam- 
ily ... ?’’ It need hardly be said that this question 
is not anew one. For twenty years or more educators 
have been wrestling with it; and from time to time 
it re-emerges to provoke fresh discussion and bring 
forth a new crop of statistics. What, then, are 
the recent facts and figures in regard to this moot 
question? 
In an article in the Journal of Heredity the writer 
quoted above shows that of the 959 Vassar graduates of 
the classes 1867-1892 only 53 per cent. were married in 
1915, leaving 450 graduates, or 47 per cent., in single 
blessedness. That means, of course, that in a period 
varying from 23 to 48 years after graduation only a 
little more than half of Vassar’s graduates had become 
wives. Wellesley’s figures reveal much the same con- 
dition. Of the 528 alumne of the classes 1875-1889 
only 50 per cent. were married in 1915, from 26 to 40 
years after graduation. Of the 3,927 Wellesley alumne 
in the more recent classes 1890-1912 only 31 per cent 
were married in 1915. Nor do the figures with respect 
to the birth-rate among women graduates at all cor- 
respond to Mr. Sprague’s idea of the needs of the situ- 
ation. Far from there being three matured children 
to every married graduate in the classes mentioned 
above, Vassar shows only 1.91 such children, while 
Wellesley records show 1.65 children per married 
graduate of the classes 1890-1912. Clearly college 
women are not perpetuating themselves.' 
In 1903 a careful study of the marriage and birth 
rates among college graduates was made by G. Stanley

Hall and Theodate Smith. The figures with respect to 
Vassar, Smith, and Wellesley are interesting :— 
CoLLEGE CLassEs PER CENT. OF GRAD- CHILDREN 
UATES MARRIED Per married Per 
in 1903 graduate Mother. 
867-76 55.41 2.03 3.09 
Vassar 1877-86 50.79 1.53 2.57 
1887-96 28.02 a9 1.58 
Smith 1879-88 42.7 1.99 2.08 
1889-98 28.35 okt 1.22 
Wellesley 1879-88 46.55 1.81 2.37 
1889-98 25.47 1.04 1.67 
The briefest examination of these figures reveals 
some significant facts. From 27 to 36 years after 
graduation only slightly more than 55 per cent of 
Vassar’s early alumnz were married; and among this 
group the average number of children born was slightly 
more than two per married member and three per 
mother. Of the next ten classes (1877-86) less than 
51 per cent were married from 17 to 26 years after 
graduation; and the average number of children per 
married member and per mother shows a marked de- 
crease. But most striking is the decline in the propor- 
tion of marriages among the next ten classes, 1887-96. 
The alumne of these classes had been graduated from 
7 to 16 years, therefore their ages were approximately 
28 to 37 years; yet the percentage of married members 
is only 28.02. The average number of children per 
married graduate has shrunken to .79, and per married 
mother to 1.58. : 
The figures for Smith and Wellesley tell a similar 
tale—less than half the graduates are married from 
15 to 25 years after graduation; and only slightly over - - 
one-fourth are married from 5 to 14 years after gradu-
-P-A-G-E-47
  COLLEGE WOMEN AND THE MARRIAGE RATE 37 
ation. Moreover, the number of children per married 
graduate of the last ten classes studied does not vary 
greatly from that of Vassar, i.e., less than one child 
in the case of Smith and 1.04 in the case of Wellesley. 
But objection may be made that these figures 
were compiled eighteen years ago. More recent are 
the investigations of Miss Van Kleeck for the Associa- 
tion of Collegiate Alumne published in the Journal 
of the Association for May, 1918.’ This study is made 
of a large proportion of the living graduates in 1914 
of eight women’s colleges (Barnard, Bryn Mawr, Mt. 
Holyoke, Radcliffe, Smith, Vassar, Wellesley, and 
Wells) with one coeducational university—Cornell. Of 
the 23,582 living graduates, 71 per cent., or 16,739, re- 
turned records on which the study is based. These 
records show that the average per cent. of married 
graduates is 39.1. Of course it should be remembered, 
in interpreting these statistics, that the more recent 
‘classes far outnumber the earlier ones. If the last ten 
classes were eliminated from consideration (ten years 
being allowed between graduation and marriage) the 
marriage rate would be conspicuously higher. This 
statement is borne out by the fact that the median mar- 
riage age, as disclosed by this investigation, is 27 years 
and 3 months and by the further fact that nearly one- 
sixth of the 6,182 married graduates who reported their 
age at first marriage were married between 30 and 35 
years of age.1 
After reflective consideration of these statistics the 
question may suggest itself: Is there a higher marriage 
and birth rate among the graduates of men’s colleges 
~ and universities? Apparently there is, even though 
1 Journal of the Association of Collegiate Alumnae, May, 1918, p. 579.
-P-A-G-E-48
38 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
the rate has steadily declined during a considerable 
period. In 1917 a study was made of Stanford’s Mar- 
riage Rate and the results were published in the Jour- 
nal of Heredity. These indicate that of 1,000 graduates 
of Stanford University in the classes of 1892-1900 73.2 
per cent. of the men were married and only 48.5 per 
cent. of the women. Allowing ten years for a graduat- 
ing class to marry, the Stanford rate for men is close to 
that of Harvard and Yale which are respectively 74 
and 78 per cent. The fact of a higher marriage rate 
among college men receives further support from the 
investigations of Banker with respect to Syracuse Uni- 
versity graduates. The statistics are as follows: 
CassEs PER CENT. MARRIED Surviving CHILDREN PER 
in 1917 MARRIED GRADUATE 
Women Men Women Men 
1862-71 87 87 1.68 1.69 
1872-81 81 90 1.06 1.77 
1882-91 55 84 42. 1.72 
1892-1901 48 73 5 1.00 
These figures indicate a steady and rather rapid de- 
cline in both the marriage rate and the number of chil- 
dren per married graduate among the women, with a 
more gradually decreasing rate among the men. The 
lower marriage rate of Syracuse women, combined with 
the lower birth rate among them, leads Banker to con- 
clude that the total reproductive rate of the women 
graduates is only about one-half that of the men. It 
is interesting to speculate a little as to the probable 
reasons for so marked a disparity. Doubtless if the 
age-old law forbidding women to make proposals of 
marriage were wholly removed, leaving no reproach- 
ful ghost behind, the marriage curve of college women 
and the resulting birth curve as well, might take a sharp  
-P-A-G-E-49
  COLLEGE WOMEN AND THE MARRIAGE RATE 39 
upward trend. But even so alarming a departure from 
a custom, which conservatives would have us believe 
has its roots deep laid in Nature, would hardly bring 
the marriage and birth rates among college women to 
the level of that of the men. It is probable that the 
woman who has enjoyed the benefits of higher educa- 
tion in the liberal arts unconsciously forms for herself 
a lofty conception of the marriage relation and refuses 
to compromise with her ideals when she discovers that 
her suitors fall short of them. Not driven by the sex 
urge to the same extent as men, women find it more 
possible to hold steadily before them an ideal of mar- 
riage as a close spiritual comradeship, a community of 
interests and aims, extending to every vital aspect of 
life. Rather than fail in attaining the best many a col- 
lege woman cheerfully accepts the lot of the spinster 
worker whose economic and personal independence is 
her chief compensation for turning her back on home 
and motherhood. 
It may be asked how does the marriage rate among 
college women compare with that of the nation at large. | 
The United States Census for 1910 furnishes the an- 
swer. It shows that of the women 25 to 34 years of age 
79.1 per cent. are married; and of those between 35 and 
44 years 88.6 per cent. are married. Contrast these 
percentages with those for college graduates approxi- 
mately the same age set forth in the preceding pages; 
e.g., Vassar’s 28.02 per cent. married between the ages 
of 28 and 37; and less than 51 per cent. married be- 
tween the ages 38 to 47 years. 
But it may very pertinently be objected that it is 
grossly unscientific to compare the marriage rate of a 
selected class of women graduates of eastern colleges
-P-A-G-E-50
40 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
with the rate for the mass of American women in the 
country at large. Still less is it admissible to conclude 
that the strikingly lower rate in the case of the former 
group is due to having spent four years in a woman’s 
college. Only when the graduates of colleges for wo- 
men are compared with a similar number of their 
sisters, cousins and friends of the same social class 
can any conclusions of worth with regard to the de- 
clining marriage rate be drawn. It is difficult to see 
how the discussion of this question can be greatly clari- 
fied by the mere piling up of statistics concerning the 
small proportion of marriages among the alumne 
of our women’s colleges. The question inevitably 
suggests itself: Would not a comparative study 
of the marriage rates of college women and 
non-college women of their own walk of life tend to 
show that the decline in the proportion of marriages 
is characteristic of the social group to which they both 
belong? 
Unfortunately no such investigation has been made, 
although a comparative study of the marriage-age and 
the birth-rate among two homogeneous groups of wo- 
men appeared more than fifteen years ago in the Publi- 
cations of the American Statistical Association. In this 
article Dr. Mary Roberts Smith presented the statis- 
tical results of a comparison of 343 married college 
women with 313 non-college wives who were their sis- 
ters, cousins, or friends and thus were drawn from the 
same social class. The investigation showed that the 
average age of marriage of the college women (Class 
A) was 26.3 years; of the non-college women (Class B) 
24.3 years—a difference of two years. This age dif- 
ference reduces, of course, the fertile period of women  
-P-A-G-E-51
  COLLEGE WOMEN AND THE MARRIAGE RATE 41 
in Class A. However, the statistics revealed the in- 
teresting fact that although Class B had a larger num- 
ber of children than Class A, the respective figures 
being 584 and 566, yet if the number of children born 
were considered with regard to the number of years 
of married life Class A had the advantage. The moth- 
ers in Class A bore one child to every 5.9 years of mar- 
ried life, whereas the women in Class B bore one to 
every 6.71 years. The statistics gathered by Mrs. 
Sidgwick in England, in the course of a similar in- 
vestigation, show much the same results. 
Obviously this study is chiefly of interest as indicat- 
ing that, at least with respect to the birth-rate among 
college women as compared with non-college women of 
their own walk in life, the easy generalizations of cer- 
tain writers concerning the unhappy influence of a col- 
lege education do not seem to be sustained. May it 
not be possible, then, that similar comparisons made 
with respect to the marriage-rate would reveal that the 
decline is a class phenomenon? 
But, in the absence of much needed comparative 
studies of the kind described above, the marital statis- 
tics of college women continue to arouse concern among 
social writers. Many readers not trained in the inter- 
pretation of statistics tend to see in these a positive 
indictment of college education for women. Unques- 
tionably such figures must be used with great caution 
if we would escape unwarrantable conclusions. Several 
years ago the need for care in their interpretation was 
pointed out by a writer in the Political Science Quar- 
terly who boldly declared that the marital statistics of 
college women ‘‘no more establish a causal relation 
between marriage and the higher education of women
-P-A-G-E-52
42 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
than the occurrence of rain in a certain phase of the 
moon proves that the latter governs the former.’ ! 
In making deductions from the figures at hand it is 
well to bear in mind that they are not commonly chosen 
from the colleges and universities in the country at 
large but from Vassar, Mt. Holyoke, Smith, Welles- 
ley and Bryn Mawr—eastern colleges for women. This 
fact alone has an important influence upon the figures 
which may well escape the average reader. In the first 
place the families from which the alumne of these col- 
leges are drawn are distinctly above the average in 
financial means and social standing. Moreover a large 
proportion of the students come from urban centers. 
These two conditions tend to reduce the marriage and 
birth rates; for both are relatively low in cities and in 
precisely that prosperous middle class from which east- 
ern colleges are largely recruited. Probably, writes 
Emerick, in commenting on this fact, ‘‘there is no 
body of college women less comparable with those from 
the country at large.’’ 
Coeducation and the Marriage Rate.—Let us turn, 
then, to such evidence on this question as can be secured 
from our great coeducational universities in the Middle 
West and on the Pacific coast. In an article on ‘‘Co- 
education and marriage’’ published in the Journal of 
Heredity in January, 1917, Mr. Price gives the percent- 
age of women graduates of the University of Cali- 
fornia married in stated periods from 1864 to 1904. In- 
stead of taking all the graduates, however, Mr. Price 
selected every tenth name from the alumne directory, 
thus getting a random sample of women graduates.

With the exception of the first two periods, when the 
number of women students at the University of Cali- 
fornia was very small, the marriage percentages are 
higher than in the eastern colleges for women. It is 
significant also that the writer found that one-third of 
all the women graduates of California who marry at 
ail marry University of California men. These results 
were confirmed by a further study of the class of 1906 
asa whole. This class, which had been graduated ten 
years when the study was begun, included 189 women, 
of whom 90, or nearly 50 per cent., were married. Hx- 
actly one-third of these women had married men of 
their own university. 
Not content with investigating the marriage rate at 
California, Mr. Price went far afield and collected the 
following statistics from colleges and universities in 
the Middle West.

From these statistics Mr. Price concludes that none 
of the coeducational institutions has a marriage rate 
as low as that of eastern colleges. But he shrewdly 
adds that it may be the marriage rate of eastern women 
in general is lower than the corresponding rate in the 
west. Such in fact is the case. The United States 
Census for 1910 gives the following percentages in 
selected states in the Hast, Middle West, and on the 
Pacific coast.

These figures indicate that Massachusetts and New 
York respectively have 37.4 and 30.6 per cent. of single 
women between the ages of 25 and 34, whereas Califor- 
nia and Washington respectively have only 27.6 and 
21.6 per cent. The percentage of single women of the 
given ages in Kansas is even lower, being only 19.7. 
Preliminary press announcements issued by the Bu- 
reau of the Census on January 26, 1922, confirm these 
inequalities in marital percentages. They show that 
the New England and Middle Atlantic divisions, where 
most of the women’s colleges are located, have the fol- 
lowing percentages of single females 15 years of age 
and over: 
New England 32.1 
Middle Atlantic 29.8 
The corresponding percentages for western divisions 
are: 
Mountain 23.4 
Pacific 23.5 
It is apparent, then, that not all the disparity in the 
marriage rates of coeducational universities and east- 
ern colleges for women can be laid at the door of the 
latter. 
But if eastern colleges cannot be held wholly respon- 
sible for the low marriage rates among their graduates, 
yet it is probably true, as one writer observes, that 
‘four years of early womanhood spent in seclusion 
from free acquaintance with men, and in a pretty elab- 
orate and pleasant social life constructed out of purely 
feminine materials leave a woman less disposed and 
less fitted afterwards for informal friendships and co- 
operation with men; and it may be that these informal
-P-A-G-E-56
46 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
relations prove oftener the path to marriage for 
thoughtful women than more conventional social in- 
tercourse.’’? 
Doubtless the older colleges in the Hast have devel- 
oped a mellow atmosphere and a type of organized life, 
social and academic, which is full of charm for the girls 
who share in it. But it can hardly be maintained that 
such a conventual existence is normal or designed to 
promote comradeship and sympathy between the two 
sexes who must somehow work and play and plan to- 
gether as well as marry and carry on the race. Indeed, 
one writer declares with assurance that separate col- 
leges for women ‘‘are from the viewpoint of the 
eugenist an historic blunder.’’ 
Responsibility of College Education for the Low 
Marriage Rates of College Women.—The critics of col- 
lege education for women, when considered in the 
light of the marriage rate, have definite strictures to 
pass upon it. They point out the failure of higher edu- 
cation to make young women desirous of having homes 
of their own and of being efficient managers within 
them. In a recent article the statement is made with 
some bitterness that the ‘‘stubborn resistance of these 
colleges to the introduction of education for domestic 
efficiency, especially in the care of the infant, has been 
amazing. They are thereby neglecting one of the most 
important factors in a woman’s sound education.’’ 2 
In similar spirit writes Dr. Sprague: ‘‘There is 
needed throughout the nation a campaign of public 
education through church, school, and legislation, to 
strengthen the ideals and economic foundations of the 
1Millicent Shinn, “Marriage Rate of College Women,” in The Century,

COLLEGE WOMEN AND THE MARRIAGE RATE 47 
family. . . . If college women would combine their cul- 
ture with domestic ideals and efficiency there would be 
a higher demand for them as helpmeets and mothers 
of the new generation.’’ Nor do the writer’s animad- 
versions stop here. He is profoundly impressed by the 
fact that a high proportion of the teaching body of 
women’s colleges is composed of women and of un- 
married instructors of both sexes. ‘‘More strong 
men,’’ he says, ‘‘are needed on the staffs of public 
schools and women’s colleges, and in all of these insti- 
tutions more married instructors of both sexes are de- 
sirable. The catalogue of one of the colleges shows 
114 professors and instructors of whom 100 are women, 
of whom only two have ever been married. Is it to be 
expected that the curriculum created by such a staff 
would idealize and prepare for the family and home 
life as the greatest work in the world and the highest 
goal of women, and teach race survival as a patriotic 
duty? Or would it be expected that these bachelor 
staffs would glorify the independent vocation and life 
for women and create employment bureaus to enable 
their graduates to get into the offices, schools, and other 
lucrative jobs? The latter seems to be what occurs.’’ + 
These are sharp indictments and since they drive 
close to the heart of a large and complex question they 
deserve careful consideration. It is possible that a 
campaign of public enlightenment concerning the basic 
character of the family in social life, together with the 
introduction of carefully planned courses on home- 
making and infant care in women’s higher schools 
might have the effect of causing at least a temporary 
rise in the marriage rate of college women. A largely

conceived and liberalizing course in home economics 
might well awaken in young women a new interest in 
the home and in its ordering, to the ends not only of 
efficiency but of beauty and happiness. Indeed at such 
institutions as the State Colleges of Agriculture of 
Kansas and of Iowa, where much attention is given to 
domestic science, the marriage rates are notably high. 
In 1916 69 per cent. of the women of the Iowa State 
College belonging to the classes of 1902-1905 were 
married, and 72.7 per cent. of all the alumne from 
1872-1905 were married. Of the early classes 1872- 
1881 actually 95.8 per cent. had become wives. As we 
have seen, Kansas Agricultural College shows 63.5 per 
cent. of the alumne of the classes 1900-1904 married 
in 1916. Of course it should be kept in mind that the 
marriage rates of these two states are high. Then, 
too, the principle of selection cannot be ignored in in- 
terpreting these figures. The young women who at- 
tend the Home Economies schools of these colleges are 
very frankly looking forward to marriage; just as the 
men who are pursuing the agricultural courses, drawn 
as they are largely from farming communities, are 
planning soon to set up farm homes of their own in 
which wives will be indispensable co-workers. 
But a principle of selection is no less at work in deter- 
mining the personnel of liberal arts colleges for women 
both in the East and West. It is not necessary to ac- 
cept the suggestion of one writer that the college has 
‘chad the effect of segregating from the general popu- 
lation on the average the non-productive type of woman 
[who is] more or less lacking in the normal sex in- 
stincts.’? Unquestionably the selective influences most

actively at work in determining the college-woman 
group are intellectual and moral. It should not be for- 
gotten that in entering college young women give ex- 
pression to their intellectual tastes, their ideals, and 
their ambitions and hopes for the future. The fact that 
a girl free to choose elects to submit for four years to 
the intellectual discipline of a college usually means 
that her mental horizon has widened, that she has al- 
ready developed a taste for intellectual activity, that 
she is planning to use her trained mind and developed 
capacities in a life career. To put it in the refreshingly 
frank fashion of a recent contributor to the New Re- 
public: ‘‘Only 39 per cent. of college girls marry, not 
because education has that effect but because the girl 
who elects to take a college course puts the things the 
college stands for before the attentions of the male sex. 
Those same girls who elected to go to college—given 
congenial work—would have shown the same percen- 
tage of marriage had they never gone to college.’’? 
Influence of Present Social Conditions on the Mar- 
riage Rate.—This is only to say that the educated 
young woman of to-day is an individualized being in 
precisely the same way as her educated brothers or 
men friends are individualized. And it is this obstinate 
and inconvenient fact that critics like Mr. Sprague re- 
fuse utterly to reckon with. Looking at the question 
solely from the biological standpoint of the renewal-of 
the species, these men urge colleges to ‘‘idealize and 
prepare for the home life as the greatest work and the 
highest goal of women, and teach race survival as a 
patriotic duty.’? This demand shows the prevailing 
tendency to think of men as individuals, entitled to ex- 
+ 0p. cit., May 25, 1918. 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
  50 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
ercise personal initiative and choice with respect to 
their life work, and to lump women together as pro- 
spective wives, mothers and home-makers—a tendency 
so deep-grounded that it will probably not be uprooted 
for generations. Needless to say the fact that nearly 
all women in the past were housewives and mothers 
does not argue that all were well fitted so to be or that 
this would have been their chosen career had they been 
free as their brothers to elect it. Probably, as Dr. Leta 
Hollingworth has suggested, the maternal instinct is 
distributed among women in varying degrees; and the 
social devices employed in the past to encourage moth- 
erhood, ranging from the pressure of public opinion, 
art and literature to that of powerful religious sanc- 
tions, have effectively played their part in reinforcing 
this instinct to the end of perpetuating the race under 
adverse social conditions. 
But. the circumstances which once demanded the de- 
votion of the majority of women’s lives to the great 
tasks of child-bearing and rearing have been pro- 
. foundly altered. Increased knowledge of the principles 
of sanitation, nutrition, and child hygiene has resulted 
in a steady decrease in the child mortality once so ap- 
pallingly high. And this is not all. Social and eco- 
nomic conditions and the controlling ideas which spring 
from them have been gradually transformed since the 
Industrial Revolution. There is a growing demand for 
women’s work in the world outside the home, not alone 
in the field of unskilled labor where scores of thousands 
are employed, but likewise in the skilled professions 
and occupations. Beyond question the alumnex of our 
colleges are responding to the call in rapidly growing 
18ee Amer. Jour. of Soc., XXII: 19-29.

Ta ee eee 
COLLEGE WOMEN AND THE MARRIAGE RATE 51 
phalanxes.. Although a considerable percentage are 
still flocking into the teaching profession, yet the pro- 
portion of those entering other skilled vocations was on 
the increase even before the war,! and is rapidly grow- 
ing. And with this change in the economic situation 
has come a change in public opinion with respect to 
“‘woman’s sphere.’’ 
Students of social conditions, then, are confronted 
with two stubborn facts with which they must reckon 
in any honest attempt to interpret the marital sta- 
tistics of college women. The first is the individualiza- 
tion of women that is in part the result of social cir- 
cumstances and in part the consequence of their higher 
education. This leads many college graduates to desire, 
a congenial outlet for their powers, not merely in selfish 
pursuits but in skilled work which has human signifi- , 
cance and value. Among these trained and cultured 
women a growing number find satisfaction for their 
nurturing instincts in the professions of teaching, so- 
cial service, private and public health nursing, and 
medicine. Secondly, the idea is rapidly gaining accep- 
tance in the public mind that unmarried women, at: 
least, should not settle back into a state of contented 
dependence upon fathers and brothers. In an age when 
both college and non-college women are being educated, 
like their brothers, to accept a sturdy ideal of financial 
independence, and when at the same time locked doors 
of vocational opportunity are swinging open for them, 
it seems idle to talk of home life ‘‘as the greatest work 
and the highest goal of women,’’ and of race perpetu- 
ation as their supreme ‘‘patriotic duty.’? We may de- 
plore, if we will, the transformations that have taken

52 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
place since the days of our grandmothers; we may 
even do something, through broadly-planned courses 
centering about the home, to stem the current of edu- 
cated women into the arena of the world’s work. But 
we cannot turn the hands of the social clock backward 
to the ‘‘good old days’’ of our forbears, for these are 
irrevocably gone. So long as women form standards 
of married life with which they refuse to compromise; 
so long as society affords them a chance to exercise 
their trained powers in congenial work; and, above all, 
so long as the doors of economic opportunity are shut 
in the face of the married woman, there will be women, 
college-trained and otherwise, who will not marry. 
The situation is further complicated by the fact that 
the marriage rate is declining among college men, and, 
presumably, among that well-to-do middle class from 
which these men are recruited. Many a woman college 
graduate would marry if she were asked by the right 
man. Indeed, in this whole controversy writers are 
prone to forget that, in the matter of mating, custom 
decrees that women must play a passive and sometimes 
a waiting réle. The length of time now demanded of 
even college men before they can establish themselves 
in a profession or in business is so extended that not 
infrequently the romantic years are passed before mar- 
riage can be considered. In such a case the man often 
discovers that he can be made perfectly comfortable in 
bachelor quarters, and has ample opportunity to meet 
his women friends when he is so inclined. Marriage 
comes to mean to him not only loss of independence, 
but large financial outlay to maintain a wife and 
family; therefore the wedded state is likely to be- 
come less and less attractive to the young bachelor
-P-A-G-E-63

COLLEGE WOMEN AND THE MARRIAGE RATE 53 
with the passage of years. Itis because of this situation 
that the critics of the present type of college education 
for women come out strongly in favor of home eco- 
nomics training in women’s colleges. Thus one critic 
writes: 
“The very proper preference in many intelligent 
men for girls trained to be efficient wives and mothers 
is one of the causes of the low marriage rate and late 
time of marriage of the graduates of women’s col- 
leges. The trained girl can and will marry a man with 
an income too restricted for the support of an ineffi- 
cient wife.’’+ 
Here is clearly an impasse. A certain group of un- 
married men do show a marked desire to secure effi- 
cient home-keepers as wives; while the young women 
they meet socially have in many instances tasted the 
joys of economic independence and success in a chosen 
vocation and have little interest and less skill in domes- 
tic work. As we have seen, it seems doubtful that the 
introduction into colleges of compulsory courses in 
household economy could do much to induce a certain 
type of young woman, intellectually gifted or with or- 
ganizing ability of a high order, cheerfully to relin- 
quish the profession for which she is trained in order 
to take up the tasks of cooking, cleaning, and sewing for 
which she is little fitted. But—and this is a point often 
ignored—this does not necessarily mean that the door 
of marriage must remain permanently closed to these 
young women, vigorous of body and mind and warm 
of heart, capable of making excellent wives and moth- 
ers in a social system more responsive to their needs 
and aspirations. Gradually, very gradually it must be

54 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
admitted, the deep-rooted prejudice against the con- 
tinuance of her vocation by a trained woman after 
marriage is being undermined. Of course the outstand- 
ing difficulty is that of motherhood under such condi- 
tions. But here again a less rigid economic system 
would make it possible for a woman to withdraw for 
the necessary year or two devoted wholly to the bear- 
ing and nurture of a child, taking up her profession 
for a full or part-time day after that period. 
Needless to say much must be done in the way of 
drastic modification of our customary modes of thought 
and of work before such a change can be effected. Yet 
one has only to look about him to see individual in- 
stances where such a scheme of married life has 
achieved more than a moderate success. In a vigorous 
article on Higher Education of Women and the Family, 
Elsie Clews Parsons expresses her view of this trouble- 
some question: ‘‘The emasculated form of the pro- 
prietary family which now prevails is in my opinion 
bound to persist until the economic status of the wife 
is altered, until she becomes independent through her 
own productive labor. ... Moreover, this economic 
independence must be won by the women of the higher 
cultural classes before the character of the family 
ean be thereby affected. The hard-driven tenement 
house-wife who supports her good-for-nothing or un- 
employed husband, the farmer’s wife who works harder 
than even her hard-working husband, or the factory 
hand’s wife who supplements his wages, are, in spite 
of their labor, thoroughly unemancipated women. .. . 
It is, then, on the fight of the professional woman to 
get back into the family that the future of the family. 
will depend. But in the present temper of the commu-  
-P-A-G-E-65
  COLLEGE WOMEN AND THE MARRIAGE RATE 55 
nity and under existing economic conditions it is likely 
to be a losing fight... . A whole day’s work or no 
work are likely to be her alternatives. .. . Many men 
and almost all women suffer from this economic inelas- 
ticity. . . . Women therefore should be peculiarly hos- 
pitable to any change in the productive system tending 
to eliminate competition cither between men and 
women or between child-bearing and non-child-bearing 
women.’’ + 
Is Celibacy Among College Women Socially Disad- 
vantageous?— But another aspect of this many-sided 
problem should be considered. Even if.a fairly high 
proportion of college women elect to remain single, is 
this necessarily a social evil? On this question there 
are held at present two widely divergent views. One 
theory maintains that, generally speaking, the women 
who complete the college course are ‘‘more or less lack- 
ing in the normal sex instincts’’; thus the college has 
the effect ‘‘of segregating from the general population 
on the average the non-productive type of women.’’ 
On this theory, the college course ‘‘has not suppressed 
or perverted female instincts so much as it has failed 
to appeal to them.’’ The author goes on to inquire 
whether we are not ‘‘unduly alarmed at the eugenic 
disaster which seems to threaten from the low birth 
rate of this supposedly superior class of women? It 
is doubtful if they are a superior class except in a 
strictly limited sense—often a purely intellectual su- 
periority.’’ These women represent a ‘‘highly special- 
ized class of low fecundity’? and our writer concludes 
that ‘‘it is not to be supposed that a different type of 
college training would have been desirable for them, 
1Amer, Jour, of Soc., XIV: 763. Italics mine. 
 
-P-A-G-E-66
       
    56 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
nor is it evident that any other form of education 
would have increased their productiveness materially.’’ 
On the other hand, the college should provide another 
kind of training for the sisters of these intellectuals, 
the ‘‘normal, all-round, red-blooded women [who] are 
the really superior type .. .’? and whose ‘‘domestic 
and motherly instincts seek equally if less obtrusively 
the opportunity for full development and expres- 
sion. 2/..7?* 
This view is reinforced by that of another social 
writer who holds that college-bred women are less apt 
“‘to be wholly absorbed in their children and to give 
themselves up to them with a complete abandonment.”’ 
He concludes that if this be true ‘‘society loses no more 
by reason of the celibacy of an educated man or woman 
than from that of one less favored, and that the celibacy 
of the cultured classes if it exists is not peculiarly to be 
deplored.’’ ? 
Waiving the point whether total ‘‘absorption of 
mothers in their children’’ and ‘‘complete abandon- 
ment’’ to them have beneficent effects on either mother 
or child, it may be pointed out that no satisfactory 
scientific data have been collected which go to show that 
college women are inferior in sex and maternal in- 
stincts to other women of their class. Such a theory 
appears to be a pure assumption from the fact of the 
relatively low marriage and birth rates among the 
alumnz of women’s colleges—a condition which has 
social and economic causes and which, it is necessary 
to repeat, may very well be found to exist in the entire 
social group to which college women belong.

COLLEGE WOMEN AND THE MARRIAGE RATE 57 
A quite opposite point of view to the above is enun- 
ciated by other writers who regard the eugenic problem 
involved in the low marriage rate of college women 
as a serious matter. In a recent article on the small 
proportion of the alumne of Stanford University who 
marry, the author states: ‘‘It can hardly be doubted 
that most of the Stanford women are of precisely the 
type whose eugenic contribution the race most needs.’’ + 
This theory is shared by Professor D. Collin Wells, 
who declares that it ‘‘is for the advantage of mankind 
that superior women should become mothers.’’ Yet 
Mr. Wells is obliged to admit that intellectual ability 
‘is not a dominant Mendelian character that breeds 
true to the parental type.’’? Nevertheless Karl Pear- 
son has found that ‘‘exceptional fathers produce ex- 
ceptional sons at a rate 3 to 6 times as great as non- 
exceptional—the superior stock produces above the 
average at over twice the rate of the inferior stock. 
Pairs of exceptional parents produce exceptional sons 
at a rate more than 10 times as great as pairs of non- 
exceptional parents.’’ ? 
From a purely eugenic standpoint, then, it is socially 
desirable that college-trained women should marry | 
and bear children. The difficulties in the path have 
already been suggested and would not seem to be 
insuperable. But, in the considerable interval which 
will doubtless have to intervene before society cheer- 
fully accepts the married professional woman, may 
not students of society and of education derive com- 
fort and satisfaction from the records of the college 
women who do marry? It is a well established fact

that divorces among college women are very rare. 
Also the figures of the Census of College Women re- 
ferred to above show that of 4,626 children born to 
women graduates of the classes 1900-1910 only 4.6 per 
cent. had died in 1915; and of the 447 children born to 
married alumne of the classes 1910-1915 only 4.9 per 
cent. had died. These are low child-mortality figures, 
contrasting most favorably with those of the country at 
large and especially with the rates in selected industrial 
centres among the working class.t. In warm eulogy of 
the kind of marriages college women make, an alumna 
writes: ‘‘If less than fifty per cent. of college women 
marry, yet of that number few take husbands ‘for a 
home’ or because they have nothing else to do... . 
Alumna’s marriage ... means that a mature, inde- 
pendent, trained woman deliberately chooses to give 
the direction of her life to a man because she loves him 
well enough to find in so doing her greatest happiness. 
Of such mating are Alumna’s children born—of a 
‘selected’ father, of a mother who has at least had an 
opportunity for knowledge,—born to a heritage of in- 
telligent love and care. So they ought to be a power 
for good, even though they are few.’’? 
In conclusion the old question may be asked in all 
seriousness whether, after all, the welfare of society 
is so bound up with the increase of the population as 
it is in improving its quality. Nature has seen to it 
that the mating instinct in normal men and women and 
the maternal instinct * in many women shall be urgent

enough to secure the continuance of the race. It is the 
problem of civilized society, with its face set toward 
the dawn of better things, to secure for every child born 
into its midst the best possible conditions of home life 
and of education. To improve the physical, intellect- 
ual, and moral quality of its members is society’s para- 
mount task; and the broad and useful education of 
every young man and woman in such wise as to secure | 
his or her finest contribution to the common life, be it | 
within or without the home, would appear to be the 
most efficient method to attain this end. The idea has 
been forcefully expressed by a contemporary writer: 
“In fact the question which the State has to ask of: 
its educated men and women is not whether they marry, 
but what they are; not whether they add to the physical 
but to the intellectual and spiritual life of the world. 
. .. Ina word, the marriage of a man or woman, or of 
any particular class of men or women is inconsequential 
to the state. The imperative thing is the character of 
their thought, their act, their mental output. History 
and observation surely do not warrant the assertion 
that the quality of these is determined by marriage.’’ + 
If this be a sound conclusion it seems advisable for 
colleges and universities to continue their work of edu- 
eating young women in a broader and more sympa- 
thetic understanding of human life in its physical and 
social environment, as well as in a more effective use 
of their trained powers for social ends. By all means 
let there be ample opportunity for these young women 
to become acquainted with the history, the problems, 
and the rich contributions of the family as the funda- 
mental institution of society, determining as it does in

large measure the character and the spiritual level of 
social life in any age. Let the schools also furnish 
facilities for understanding and for developing skill in 
meeting the problems of the home beautiful, the home 
sanitary, the home efficient. But, when all these oppor- 
tunities have been furnished, let educators be content 
| to permit each young woman as an individual to deter- 
mine for herself the character of her education and her 
life work under the expert and sympathetic guidance of 
trained advisers. In many young graduates Nature’s 
call will prove too strong to be resisted and sooner or 
later they will become wives and mothers. Others will 
wait long to find the ideal mate and, not finding him, 
will expend, during a busy lifetime, their knowledge 
and skill in serving society’s needy ones—the poor, the 
mental and moral defectives, the sick, the children and 
youth of the nation—as well as in the struggle to 
realize a more humane and beautiful social order. 
Sterile lives? Perhaps. But when has society elected 
to measure the fruitfulness of individuals wholly in 
biological terms?

CHAPTER III 
SEX DIFFERENTIATION IN EDUCATION 
Views of the Advocates of a Sex Differentiated Edu- 
cation.— During the last half century, a period in which 
the education of girls and women has been increasingly 
regarded as a matter of serious concern, a group of 
individuals, educators and others, has consistently - 
advocated a type of education for women different in 
important particulars from that for men. The grounds 
of their somewhat ardent advocacy of a differentiated 
education for women are physiological, psychological, 
and social. Probably the most eloquent exponent of 
this view is Dr. G. Stanley Hall, who has devoted many 
pages to the presentation of evidence gleaned from the 
opinions of biologists and physicians, all tending to 
support his theory that the education of young women 
in the crucial adolescent years should be sharply differ- 
entiated from that of their brothers. Since Dr. Hall’s 
books are widely circulated and since, moreover, he 
is the ready spokesman of a section of the community 
by no means negligible, his views should be examined in 
some detail. 
In his voluminous work on Adolescence Dr. Hall at- 
tacks the problem of ‘‘ Adolescent Girls and Their Edu- 
eation.’’1 At the outset he proclaims his own position 
and devotes most of the chapter to the presentation of 
evidence, more or less empirical, in support of it. Thus 
1Vol. I, Ch. XVII.

the argument throughout is a priori, and the opening 
statement confidently categorical: 
“Our modern knowledge of woman represents her 
as having characteristic differences from man in every 
organ and tissue, as conservative in body and mind, 
fulfilling the function of seeing to it that no acquired 
good be lost to mankind, as anabolic rather than kata- 
bolic .. .-as normally representing childhood and 
_ youth in the full meridian of its glory in all her dimen- 
sions and nature. . . . Her whole soul, conscious and 
unconscious, is best conceived as a magnificent organ 
of heredity, and to its laws all her psychic activities, if 
unperverted, are true. . . . Biological psychology al- 
ready dreams of a new philosophy of sex which places 
the wife and mother at the heart of a new world and 
makes her the object of a new religion and almost of 
a new worship, that will give her reverent exemption 
from sex competition and reconsecrate her to the 
higher responsibilities of the human race, into the past 
and future of which the roots of her being penetrate; 
and where the blind worship of mere mental illumina- 
tion has no place; where her real superiority to man 
will have free course. .. .’’1 
It is not difficult to recognize in this exuberant ac- 
count of woman an age-old philosophy but thinly dis- 
guised in a masquerade of ‘‘biological psychology.’’ 
How familiar, even in their new pseudo-scientific garb, 
are these ideas of woman ‘‘as conservative in body and 
mind,’’ ‘‘as anabolic rather than katabolic,’’ as pos- 
sessed of a soul which is ‘‘a magnificent organ of hered- 
ity’?! The glorification of the ‘‘wife and mother,’’ her 
“reverent exemption from sex competition,’’ the care-

-P-A-G-E-74
64 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
ful exclusion of woman from the joys of ‘‘mere mental 
illumination’’—these doctrines are well-nigh as old as 
civilization. 
But what evidence is adduced in support of this view 
of woman and her functions? The greater part is 
drawn from the writings of physicians and biological 
writers and is designed to show, in the words of one 
of them, that ‘‘the male is the agent of variation and 
progress, and transmits variations best, so that per- 
haps the male cell and sex itself originated in order 
to produce variation. . . . An ideal or typical male is 
hard to define, but there is a standard ideal woman.’’ 
Dr. Storer’s article on Female Hygiene, published in 
1871, is cited as evidence that ‘‘girls should be edu- 
cated far more in body and less in mind.’’ This ap- 
pears to be the view of several other physicians, one 
of whom declares that each ‘‘individual stage and 
organ has just so much energy. We should strive sedu- 
lously to keep the mental back in all and especially 
in females, and not ‘spoil a good mother’ to make a 
grammarian.’’ Reference is further made to the 
theories of Dr. Crichton who holds that ‘‘differences 
between sexes are involved in every organ and tissue.”’ 
So concerned is this gentleman that the plain lessons of 
biology and physiology shall not be set at naught that 
he bitterly laments the opening of the theological de- 
partment of the University of St. Andrews to women 
as ‘‘a down-hill step fraught with confusion and dis- 
aster.’? As a coup de grace to the opposition he deals 
the final logical blow by quoting Huxley’s dictum that 
‘‘what has been decided among prehistoric protozoa 
cannot be annulled by an act of Parliament’’!+ 
1See Hall, op. cit., pp. 567-86 for the positions summarized above.
-P-A-G-E-75
SEX DIFFERENTIATION IN EDUCATION 65 
Dr. Hall next considers the health of women stu- 
dents and cites the testimony of various physicians 
and educators in an attempt to show that the health 
of girls, especially in respect to menstruation, is un- 
favorably affected by higher education. The results 
of Engelmann’s study of 4,873 cases of school and col- 
lege girls, made about 1900, are given in full. These 
show a higher percentage of menstrual sufferers during 
normal school and college years than in the period 
preceding entrance.t However, Dr. Hall admits that 
this is not the conclusion of Dr. Mary Jacobi who ‘‘in- 
sists there is nothing in the nature of menstruation to 
imply the necessity or even the desirability of rest for 
a woman whose menstruation is really normal.’’ She 
even declares that university education involves no 
strain other than women ordinarily can bear without 
injury, so that they often pass through college with- 
out effect upon their health either way.? 
After introducing the reader to the views of biolo- 
gists and doctors Dr. Hall goes on to elaborate a 
theory of his own—that of the marked divergence of 
the sexes in the pubescent period. Nature, declares the 
author, ‘‘decrees that with advancing civilization the 
sexes shall not approximate but differentiate, and we 
shall probably be obliged to carry sex distinctions, at 
least of method, into many if not most of the topics 
of the higher education. Now that woman has by gen- 
eral consent attained the right to the best that man 
has, she must seek a training that fits her own nature 
as well or better.’’? Boys and girls tend to separate in 
the early teens and lead their lives apart. ‘‘Their

66 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
home occupations differ as do their plays, games, 
tastes. History, anthropology, and sociology as well 
as home life abundantly illustrate this. This is normal 
and biological.’’ In view of these facts ‘‘it is high time 
to ask ourselves whether the theory and practice of 
identical coeducation, especially in the high school, 
which has lately been carried to a greater extreme in 
this country than the rest of the world recognizes, has 
not brought certain grave dangers, and whether it 
does not interfere with the natural differentiations seen 
everywhere else.’’? Dr. Hall’s final indictment is ren- 
dered against the woman’s college on the ground that 
‘it is based upon the assumption, implied and often 
expressed, if not universally acknowledged, that girls 
should primarily be trained to independence and self- 
support, and. that matrimony and motherhood, if it 
come, will take care of itself, or, as some even urge, 
is thus best provided for.’’ Far from accepting this 
heresy, Dr. Hall paints in vivid colors the ideal school 
for the education of adolescent girls, always ‘‘with the 
proper presupposition of motherhood.’’ Briefly the 
scheme is as follows: Girls between the ages of twelve 
or thirteen and the early twenties should be trained in 
the country ‘‘in the midst of the hills,’’ with the para- 
mount aim of establishing their health. At this point 
the author gives sensible advice concerning out-of-door 
sports and exercise, wholesome diet, and regular sleep. 
Manners should receive careful attention on the theory 
that they ‘‘are really minor or sometimes major 
morals.’’? Another controlling ideal should be regular- 
ity. And here Dr. Hall breaks into an enthusiastic 
panegyric on periodicity which he characterizes as 
“‘perhaps the deepest law of the cosmos [which] cele-
-P-A-G-E-77

brates its highest triumphs in woman’s life. For years 
everything must give way to its thorough and settled 
establishment. In the monthly Sabbaths of rest the 
ideal school should revert to the meaning of the word 
leisure. The paradise of stated rest should be re- 
visited, idleness be actively cultivated; reverie, in 
which the soul, which needs these seasons of withdrawal 
for its own development, expatiates over the whole life 
of the race should be provided for and encouraged in 
every legitimate way, for in rest the whole momentum 
of heredity is felt, in ways most favorable to full and 
complete development. Then woman should realize 
that to be is greater than to do; should step reverently 
aside from her daily routine and let Lord Nature work. 
... Another principle should be... to keep the 
purely mental back and by every method to bring the 
intuitions to the front; appeals to tact and taste should 
be incessant; a purely intellectual man is no doubt 
biologically a deformity, but a purely intellectual 
woman is far more so.’’+ 
But even Dr. Hall would not have this human in- 
strument for race perpetuation left wholly ignorant. 
She is to study Nature; with emphasis on the ‘‘poetie 
and mythic factors,’’ art, literature, and history ‘‘with 
the biographical element very prominent throughout, 
with plenty of stories of heroes of virtue, acts of valor 
[and] tales of saintly lives... .’’ But metaphysics, 
the theory of knowledge and logic should have the least 
place, and physics and chemistry should ‘‘be kept to 
elementary stages.’? Very important is ‘‘domesticity’’ 
which ‘‘will be taught by example in some ideal home 
building by a kind of laboratory method. The training 
1 Adolescence, p. 639. Italics mine,  
-P-A-G-E-78
  68 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
should aim to develop power of maternity in soul as 
well as in body so that home influence may extend 
on and up through the plastic years of pubes- 
eence.......7'* 
Perhaps there are individuals to whom this ardent 
sketch of the emasculated education suitable to young 
women will make powerful appeal. But it may not be 
too daring to predict that most thoughtful men and 
women will be divided between a desire to laugh and 
to protest. Obviously Dr. Hall has elevated regard 
for the sex and maternal functions of woman into a 
cult which profoundly affects his conception of her en- 
tire education. He would seriously advocate the with- 
drawal of healthy girls from active, wholesome life 
during monthly periods in which they would be en- 
couraged to let their souls ‘‘expatiate over the whole 
life of the race’’ as a preparation for their high mis- 
sion. Quite cheerfully the author ignores alike the fact 
of woman’s individuality and the aim of all education 
worth the name—the development of free personality 
in the broadest possible social medium. Such a philos- 
ophy of sex would thrust girls with eager minds and 
widening vision back into the exclusively domestic cir- 
cle from which they have but recently emerged. This 
is to attempt the impossible, to revert to the social 
ideals and practices of the eighteenth century. Yet 
with entire seriousness, the theory is advanced as mod- 
ern, being garbed in a dubiously scientific dress of 
biology and psychology. Therefore it must be met in 
all fairness on its own ground. 
Some Evidence Concerning Sex Differences and Sex 
Variability.—The fundamental positions of Dr. Hall’s

  SEX DIFFERENTIATION IN EDUCATION 69 
school of thinkers are briefly, (1) that the male is the 
agent for variation and progress, whereas the female is 
the conserver of existing values; (2) that differences 
between the sexes ‘‘in every organ and tissue’’ extend 
to the mind in such wise that sex in mind is no less 
marked than sex in body; (3) that the health of high 
school and college women, especially with regard to 
menstruation, is unfavorably affected by pursuing the 
same intellectual program as that of men. Manifestly 
if these positions be grounded in fact the education of 
women must be differentiated from that of men for the 
sake of the women themselves, as well as in the inter- 
ests of social well-being and advancement. 
Let us, then, consider the first thesis—that the male 
is the agent of variation, whereas the female is by na- 
ture conservative. It is perhaps unnecessary to point 
out that this theory has been and still is widely held 
by biologists and psychologists. Yet it has been vigo- 
rously attacked within the last decade by certain psy- 
chologists on the basis of laboratory tests. The earliest 
assault, however, appears to have been made by Dr. 
Karl Pearson in 1897. In his interesting work, The 
Chances of Death and Other Studies in Evolution, 
Pearson devotes one chapter to an examination of the 
evidence in regard to anatomical variation in man and 
woman. Abandoning what he declares to be the mis- 
taken method of testing variability by the frequency 
of abnormalities among the sexes he starts from the 
principle that ‘‘the comparative variability of the sexes 
ought properly to be tested by normal rather than by 
pathological variation.’’?1 He further holds that the 
method then in use of solving the problem of the rela- 
1 Op, cit., Vol. 1: 267.
-P-A-G-E-80
70 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
tive variability of the sexes by an investigation of 
absolute variabilities is fallacious. Accordingly he 
tests the relative variability of the sexes in any organ 
or member by comparing their coefficients of variation 
as the true criterion. His investigations took the form 
of measurements of stature, weight, long and short 
bones, skull capacity, cephalic index, etc., in men and 
women. The data were obtained (1) by use of statistics 
already compiled, (2) by measurement of living men 
and women, (3) by post-mortem examinations and by 
measurement of bones taken from ancient tombs, crypts 
and cemeteries. Certain of the conclusions reached 
are quoted in full: : 
“(e) If we accept as a possible or indeed probable measure of 
significant variation the so-called coefficient of variation, ie., the 
percentage variation, for cases in which the sexual means differ con- 
siderably, and the standard deviation for cases in which the means 
are practically identical, then there is in the material considered in 
this paper—and it appears to represent more cases of normal varia- 
tion than have hitherto been treated quantitatively—no evidence 
of greater male variability, but rather of a slightly greater female 
variability. (f) Accordingly the principle that man is more variable 
than woman must be put on one side as a pseudo-scientifie super- 
stition until it has been demonstrated in a more scientific manner 
than has hitherto been attempted. (g) Those writers who find in 
this principle not only ‘social and practical consequences of the 
widest significance,’ but also an explanation of the peculiar char- 
acteristics of ‘the whole of our human civilization’ are scarcely to be 
trusted when they deal with the problems of sex. 
“I would ask the reader to note that I do not proclaim the equal 
variability of the sexes, but merely assert that the present results 
show that the greater variability often claimed for man remains as 
yet a quite unproven principle. The numerous popular writers 
who have seized this principle as a text upon which to preach 
various social lessons are, in my opinion, starting from either a 
dogma or a superstition, and not from a result of genuine scientific 
 
-P-A-G-E-81
SEX DIFFERENTIATION IN EDUCATION 71 
research. The ‘sequacity’ exhibited by the multitude of semi-scien- 
tifie writers on evolution is possibly a sign of the very small capacity 
for intellectual variation possessed by the literary male.” * 
After the publication of this much discussed study 
Havelock Ellis pointed out? that Pearson’s evidence 
was largely invalidated by the fact that his measure- 
ments were solely of adults; hence the powerful in- 
fluence of environmental factors had not been taken 
into consideration. Recognizing the justness of this 
criticism Dr. Leta Hollingworth and Dr. Helen Mon- 
tagu made a study to determine the question: ‘‘Are 
male human beings inherently more variable in anatom- 
ical traits than female human beings?’’ The experi- 
ment consisted in making ten anatomical measurements 
on every infant born in the obstetrical wards of the 
New York Infirmary for Women and Children—20,000 
measurements of infants at birth. The conclusions of 
the experimenters follow: 
“Tf we take the gross A.D. as the measure of comparative 
variability we find that in six cases the males are more variable; 
in 4 cases the females are more variable. 
“Tf we take the Pearson coefficient as the measure of variability 
we find that in six cases there is no difference in variability, when 
the P.E., of the coefficient is eomputed; in three cases the females 
are slightly more variable; in one case the males are slightly mdre 
variable. 
“Tn all cases the differences in variability are very slight. In only 
two cases does the percentile variation differ in the first decimal 
place. In these two cases the variability is once greater for males 
and once greater for females.” * 
But, as Dr. Hollingworth has herself indicated,‘ 
even if the greater variability of males in anatomical

72 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
measurements were proven this fact ‘‘would only sug- 
gest, not prove, that there is greater male variability in 
mental traits also.’’? And in this field we have little 
exact evidence. From the data regarding sex differ- 
ences in mental abilities compiled by Dr. Helen Thomp- 
son, Wissler, Gilbert, and others Dr. Thorndike esti- 
mated the percentages of males reaching or exceeding 
the median of females in each ability measured. With 
respect to sex differences he concludes: ‘‘The most im- 
portant characteristic of these differences is their 
small amount. The individual differences within one 
sex so enormously outweigh the differences between 
the sexes in these intellectual and semi-intellectual 
traits that for practical purposes the sex difference 
may be disregarded.’’ + 
But Professor Thorndike does not stop with a com- 
parison of the central tendencies of the men and women 
tested. He goes on to consider the different range of 
ability in the sexes as shown by the graphs and states 
his own conclusion with great definiteness : 
“The trivial difference between the central tendency of men and 
that of women, which is the common finding of psychological tests 
and school experience, may seem at variance with the patent fact 
that in the great achievements of the world in science, art, invention, 
and management women have been far excelled by men. One who 
accepts the equality of typical (i., modal) representatives of the 
two sides must assume the burden of explaining this great difference 
in the high ranges of achievement. 
“The probably true explanation is to be sought in the superior 
variability within the male sex. The most gifted men may be su- 
perior to the most gifted women even though the average man is 
equal to or below the average woman, if men vary widely enough 
from their central tendency.” ?

   When it comes to a consideration of the evidence at 
hand in support of his conviction Professor Thorndike 
admits that it ‘‘is unfortunate that so little information 
is available for a study of sex differences in the varia- 
bility of mental traits in the case of individuals over 
fifteen.’? With the data at hand, however, he 
feels justified in formulating the conclusion given 
above. 
But what would such differences in mental variability 
mean when applied to the education of the sexes? 
Professor Thorndike leaves us in no doubt. In an 
article entitled Sex in Education; he vigorously states 
his views on this question. 
' “This one fundamental difference in variability is more important 
than all the differences between the average male and female capac- 
ities... a slight excess of male variability would mean that of 
the hundred most gifted individuals in this country not two would 
be women, and of the thousand most gifted, not one in twenty... . 
Not} only the probability and the desirability of marriage and the 
training of children as an essential feature of woman’s career, but 
the restriction of women to the mediocre grades of ability and 
ackgievement should be reckoned with by our educational systems. . . . 
Pojstgraduate instruction, to which women are flocking in large num- 
befrs, is, at least in its higher reaches, a far more remunerative in- 
estment in the case of men.” 
This is discouraging to advocates of equal sex op- 
portunity. But discerning readers may feel that in 
judging the marked differences in sex achievements in 
science, art, literature and statesmanship, much im- 
portance should be attached to the handicaps under 
which women have labored in the past. One of these 
indubitable handicaps is indicated by Dr. Leta Holling- 
worth: 
The Bookman, XXIII: 213.

       “For the geniuses ... may be accounted for by the fact that 
woman’s biological function of reproduction has so conditioned her 
that eminence in the fields where mental energy is publicly recog- 
nized has been extremely improbable.” * 
This is true, but it is not all. Elizabeth Woodbridge 
presents another aspect of the matter: 
“Tt ought to be noted that women being still under such different 
conditions from men, all experiments which show likeness between 
them and men ought to be given great weight, since this likeness 
must be existent in spite of considerable discouragement. . . . That 
women are still under different conditions from men may perhaps be 
challenged. Many women, it will be argued, have had excellent op- 
portunities for development—more opportunities than many a news- 
boy who has risen to eminence. True, but equality of condition is 
not determined by material advantages alone. Good physical and 
mental training, good economic environment, these are not enough 
unless they are backed by what I may call, for lack of a better 
phrase, a general attitude of expectancy. The newsboy will serve 
as an illustration. .. . Whatever his goal, he knows that being; a 
newsboy, though it constitutes a handicap, does not throw him /out 
of the race. He knows that the world of men whose standards :mat- 
ter to him think of his chances in this way. They may not be actwally 
thinking about him at all. But he knows that if, or when, they 
do think of him this will be their attitude. This I call the attit\ude 
of expectancy. A sheaf of sermons might be written on its work- 
ings. 
“Tt is this which until very lately has been lacking to girls. Wit! 
a girl there has been no question whether or not she ‘has it in her. 
It has been taken for granted that she hasn’t it in her. . . . I agree 
entirely with Mr. George in thinking that this attitude of society 
makes more difference than all the material things which it may 
bestow or withhold. I believe, too, that it will be the last thir 
to change. ... This attitude toward women, largely unconscious, 
implied rather than expressed, begins at birth, and stacks the cards 
for the whole game.” ?

So much for the social handicaps which have unques- 
tionably played their part in determining the relatively 
meagre achievements of women in intellectual, artistic 
and professional fields. But can we go further and 
challenge the theory of the greater inherent variability 
of men in mental abilities? 
During the last eight years numerous experiments 
have been made, the conclusions of which in part con- 
tradict the results of Professor Thorndike’s study. 
Dr. Leta Hollingworth has assembled this material, 
and has summarized the studies made by Wells, Strong, 
Meyers, and others. Not only do they tend to show 
that the hypothesis of greater male variability in 
mental traits is still unproven but certain tests seem 
actually to show greater female variability. However, 
in some instances the conclusions were based upon a 
small number of subjects and the evidence is conflict- 
ing. 
One of the most recent studies of sex differences in 
mental variability is embodied in the Stanford Revision 
. of the Binet-Simon Scale for Measuring Intelli- 
gence made by Terman and others in 1917.1. With re- 
gard to the variability of the sexes in mental range 
as determined by the distribution of Intelligence 
Quotients in 457 boys and 448 girls the writers 
declare: 
“The facts we have presented indicate that, apart from a slight 
- superiority of the girls, from 5 to 12 years, the distribution of 
intelligence is much the same for the sexes. There is no evidence of 
any wider range of intelligence among boys, such as has commonly 
been supposed to exist. The difference, if any exists, seems to be 
in the other direction. A slightly larger per cent. of girls than of 
Ch. Iv.

  76 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
boys falls to 75 or below, which is the point frequently taken as 
indicating feeble-mindedness, and a decidedly larger per cent. of 
girls reaches as high as 125. The range that includes the middle 50 
per cent. is almost exactly the same in extent for the two sexes. 
This is all quite contrary to the traditional belief that both feeble- 
mindedness and exceptionally superior ability are more frequent 
with boys than with girls.” * 
But, as Dr. Hollingworth justly points out: 
“Even if it were determined that men actually do vary more in 
mental traits than women do, still nothing would be proved regard- 
ing their inherent variability. In order to establish greater native 
variability of either sex it is necessary to show (1) that im the trait 
being distributed the opportunity and training of the sexes have 
been exactly equal, and (2) that in neither group has variability 
had more or less survival value than in the other group. ... No 
measurements, especially mental measurements, of adults under the 
social customs which have obtained in the world of men and women 
fulfil either of our two necessary conditions. Men and women have 
devoted themselves to different activities because of the very different 
parts they play in the reproduction of the species. Women are 
under the biological necessity of bearing and rearing the children, 
and in the present almost as invariably as in the past, child-bearing 
has implied and compelled as a consequence the one occupation of 
housekeeping. Thus intellectual variability had no survival value 
for women, but rather the opposite.” ? 
The Influence of Sex upon Mental Abilities.—Let 
us turn now to the second position taken by the 
advocates of sex differentiation in education, namely, 
that sex exerts a powerful influence over mind as well 
as body. This statement may be construed in the light 
of Dr. Hall’s discussion to mean that sex affects 
women’s intellectual abilities and emotional reactions; 
and inferentially, at least, this hypothetical difference 
2 Op. cit., p. 70. 20p. cit., p. 523. 
   
-P-A-G-E-87
  SEX DIFFERENTIATION IN EDUCATION T7 
is not to the advantage of women. With respect to the 
intellectual abilities of school children we have seen 
that Terman found a superiority in intelligence among 
the girls which, although not great in amount, extended 
over a considerable period of time. Therefore the in- 
vestigators were led to compare their results with (1) 
the teachers’ estimates of the intelligence of the two 
sexes, (2) the teachers’ judgments of the quality of 
their school work, and (3) the age-grade distribution of 
boys and of girls for the ages 7 to 14 years. In the first 
two cases the teachers’ estimates fully supported the 
results of the tests in showing slightly superior intelli- 
gence and quality of school work in girls up to 13 years 
of age after which the boys showed a slight advantage. 
In examining this fact the investigators noted that the 
age-grade distribution of boys and girls differed little 
up to the age of eleven, after which for three years 
the girls were clearly in advance, and at 14 the boys 
took the lead. But the fact that 57:6 per cent. of the 
boys were in the eighth grade at 14, whereas only 33.3 
per cent. of the girls were in that grade aroused a 
suspicion in the minds of the investigators that a cer- 
tain amount of selection had taken place in the 14- 
year-old group due to the fact that a considerable num- 
ber had been promoted to the high school. They also 
surmised that this selection had occurred more often 
in the case of girls than of boys because ‘‘marked 
school acceleration occurs much oftener with girls than 
with boys at the ages 12 and 13 years.’’ A study of 
the percentage of girls in the entire number of pupils 
in grades below the high school at each age revealed a 
sharp falling off of girls at the ages 13 and 14, whereas 
by ‘‘the laws of chance the number of boys and girls 
   
-P-A-G-E-88
    78 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
found at each age ought to be nearly equal, barring 
selective influences.’’ To quote the investigators: 
“The only possible conclusion seems to be that the apparent 
superiority of boys at the age of 14, as well as also their diminished 
inferiority at 13, is due solely to the unequal selection which has 
taken place at these ages.” * 
The final conclusions of the writers are summarized 
at the end of the study. Not only do they record their 
belief that the ‘‘small superiority of the girls in the 
tests probably rests upon a real superiority in intelli- 
gence, age for age’’ but, with reference to sex varia- 
bility, they conclude: ‘‘Apart from the small superior- 
ity of the girls, the distribution of intelligence shows no 
significant difference in the sexes. The data offer no 
support to the widespread belief that girls group 
themselves more closely about the median or that ex- 
tremes of intelligence are more common among boys.’’ ? 
Sex Differences in Original Interests.—It should be 
noted, however, that most of the tests of sex differ- 
ences in mental abilities which have been made up to 
the present have not been designed to measure differ- 
ences in emotional range and intensity or in funda- 
mental taste and interest. In short they have not 
brought out differences in ‘‘psychic attitude.’? There 
is some evidence to show that women’s interests incline 
to the humanities rather than the sciences. Dr. Helen 
Thompson’s study of the sex differences revealed by 
the tests of twenty-five men and twenty-five women stu- 
dents of the University of Chicago, show marked su- 
periority of women in information about English lit- 
erature and as marked an inferiority in information

about physics. In ingenuity tests, likewise, the women 
were inferior to the men in four out of five tests. 
Thorndike also has estimated in the case of high school 
boys and girls, in the same classes, the percentage of 
boys reaching the median of the girls in selected 
studies. The percentages follow: ?

  Thorndike likewise gives the results of Miss Rusk’s 
extensive study of the grades received by boys and 
girls for scholarship in high school studies. The per- 
centages of boys who reach, or exceed the median of 
the girls follow:

  An examination of the last results shows the girls 
strikingly superior in English and languages and about 
on an equality in mathematics, which is somewhat sur- 
prising in view of the time-honored theory that women

-P-A-G-E-90
  80 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
are deficient in mathematical ability. However, the 
girls seem almost as inferior in the sciences as they 
are superior in the humanities. But who can doubt 
that in any attempt to discover women’s dominant 
tastes and interests by a study of school marks, a large 
allowance must be made for the influence of social con- 
ditions and social suggestion. It would be an incau- 
tious not to say unscientific student of the problem of 
sex differences who would maintain that women’s ex- 
cellence in and apparent preference for humanistic sub- 
jects rather than the pure and applied sciences are 
wholly due to inherent differences in interest and 
taste. For one has only to consider how rarely women’s 
lives have brought them in contact with scientific prin- 
ciples and their applications in modern industry to 
realize that circumstances have combined to discourage 
scientific proficiency in women and to encourage in 
them a ‘‘lady-like’’ acquaintance with literature and 
art. Add to this the fact that almost no incentive has 
ever been given educated women to enter the vocations 
based upon applied physics, chemistry, biology, and 
mechanics and a long stride has been made in account- 
ing for feminine indifference to the sciences. 
Sex Differences in Temperamental Traits. — But this 
does not dispose of the question concerning inherent 
emotional differences in the sexes which might have a 
profound influence upon their interests and prefer- 
ences. In this connection Thorndike cites the study 
made by Heymans and Wiersma of the temperamental 
traits of men and women, based on the estimates of 
other individuals who knew them more or less inti- 
mately. The probable percentage of men reaching the 
median woman in respect to these traits has been
-P-A-G-E-91

calculated by Thorndike and selections from the results 
are given below: 1

  Obviously the most striking difference that emerges 
from these figures is the small percentage of men who 
equal or exceed the median woman in their interest in 
persons rather than in things. Scarcely less striking 
are the differences in emotionality, impulsiveness, ex- 
citability, desire for change, aimless activity, and 
vanity of person, which are all in favor of the men, as 
are the differences in independence, love of sports, and 
sense of humor. Only in temperance, sympathy, 
patience, dissatisfaction with self, and religiousness 
have women the advantage. But do not these contrasts 
in themselves point to their explanatory causes, at least 
in part? May these not be found in large measure in 
the sharp contrasts in the life experiences of the two 
sexes? Men are more independent not only because 
they have always held the purse-strings (an all-power- 
ful aid to independence) but because their life work

has challenged self-reliance. And may it not be said 
that the life careers of men, far more often than in the 
case of women, afford variety, interest, contact with 
- Jive social, economic, and political problems, and oppor- 
tunities for initiative and original work—all of which 
» have afforded outlets for emotion, impulse and excit- 
ability, and have greatly reduced desire for change and 
aimless activity? The life and work of women in the 
home, limited in range of interest, monotonous and 
exacting in character to a large extent, and concerned 
almost wholly with personal relationships in the family 
and neighborhood, furnish precisely the environment 
to develop in women patience, sympathy, desire for 
change, and recourse to aimless activity in leisure time. 
Moreover the emotionality and excitability of men, 
which have not found outlets in their work, are very 
often brought home to be soothed away by the affec- 
tionate sympathy of the wife or mother who may her- 
self have passed through a trying domestic day with 
no one to serve as a buffer between herself and an ex- 
asperating world. Until women choose their field of 
work and have the same opportunity for self-develop- 
ment and self-expression within it as their brothers 
have, it seems idle to estimate temperamental differ- 
ences, which may in generous measure, if not wholly, 
be explained by the diverse life experiences and train- 
ing of the two sexes from babyhood. Again it must be 
remembered that few exact tests of the temperamental 
traits of the sexes have been made; and such as exist 
are in part based on doubtful evidence—that of the 
opinions of individuals. However, Hllis has assembled 
some evidence which seems to point to the greater af- 
fectability of women as shown by the sensitivity of _  
-P-A-G-E-93
SEX DIFFERENTIATION IN EDUCATION 83 
their vaso-motor and involuntary muscular systems 
to stimuli.t 
Dr. Thorndike fully recognizes that differences in 
the emotional traits measured above may well have 
been produced by circumstances, but he holds that ‘‘the 
sex differences in the instinctive acts, interests, aver- 
sions, and emotional responses should be studied apart 
from’’ such differences. He declares that the ‘‘most 
striking difference in instinctive equipment consists in 
the strength of the fighting instinct in the male and of 
the nursing instinct in the female. No one will doubt 
that men are more possessed by the instinct to fight, 
to be the winner in games and serious contests, than 
are women; nor that women are more possessed than 
men by the instinct to nurse, to care for and fuss over 
others, to relieve, comfort, and console. And probably 
no serious student of human nature can doubt that 
these are matters of original nature.’’ ? 
This statement may be grounded upon rock-ribbed 
truth, but it is a little difficult to discover by what 
scientific method the author has arrived at his con- 
clusions. It is true he refers to the fact that ‘‘the ex- 
istence of these two instincts has been long recognized 
by literature and common knowledge, but their im- 
portance in causing differences in the general activities 
of the sexes has not.’? In Thorndike’s opinion the 
fighting instinct in man ‘‘is in fact the cause of a very 
large amount of the world’s intellectual endeavor,’’ 
whereas the maternal instinct ‘‘is the chief source of 
woman’s superiorities in the moral life.’’? But do these 
declarations, grounded as they admittedly are on em- 
pirical evidence, constitute scientific knowledge? Is it 
1Ellis, Man and Woman, Ch, XIII. 2 Op. cit., p. 202. 
 
-P-A-G-E-94
    84 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
not at least conceivable that the apparent difference 
in intensity of these two instincts in men and women 
is explainable on precisely that theory of difference in 
circumstances and hence of stimuli which Thorndike 
unreservedly recognizes in the case of the other tem- 
peramental traits but rules out in this instance? Who 
can doubt that woman’s nurturing instinct has been 
socially selected or that her fighting instinct has not? 
No less does the converse appear to be true in the 
ease of men. This is not to deny that these instinctive 
differences exist; but only to point out that their ex- 
istence cannot be demonstrated by an appeal to ‘‘com- 
mon knowledge’’ which has so conspicuously been 
demonstrated to be prejudiced and unreliable in mat- 
ters relating to woman’s original nature. 
Is the Higher Education of Women Prejudicial to 
Health?— There remains for consideration the claim of 
Dr. Hall and others that ‘‘it is, to say the very least, 
not yet proven that the higher education of women is 
not injurious to their health.’’?! In arriving at this 
conclusion Dr. Hall has examined two kinds of evi- 
dence: (1) that furnished by physicians on the basis 
of their treatment of adolescent girls, and (2) that af- 
forded by questionnaires sent out to a large number of 
college women after graduation. Much of the former 
evidence cited by the author seems not to bear directly 
on the question of the effect of higher education upon 
the health of women. Many physicians are content 
to record their conviction that ample out-of-door ex- 
ercise and sound instruction in sex hygiene, especially 
with respect to menstruation, should be provided for 
adolescent girls if they are to be properly prepared 
1 Adolescence, II: 589. 
 
-P-A-G-E-95
SEX DIFFERENTIATION IN EDUCATION 85 
for motherhood and if the race is not to degenerate. 
Surely no sensible person can take issue with this 
opinion. But Dr. Hall quotes approvingly the views 
of certain other physicians who look askance upon 
women’s higher education as directly prejudicial to 
health and motherhood. Thus he cites the opinions of 
Dr. Storer in his work on Female Hygiene, published 
in 1871, to the effect that delicate girls frequently 
are ruined both in body and mind by school life 
and work. Again he quotes Dr. Beard’s indictment 
based on a study of the returns to circulars sent 
out to girls’ schools: ‘‘Nearly everything about the 
conduct of the schools was wrong, unphysiological and 
unpsychological. . . . It was clear that the teachers 
and managers of these schools knew nothing of and 
cared nothing for those matters relating to education 
that are of the highest importance. .. . Everything 
pushed in an unscientific and distressing manner, na- 
ture violated at every step, endless reciting and lectur- 
ing and striving to be first—such are the female schools 
of America at this hour.’’? 
So much for the medical evidence. The observant 
reader will doubtless note that most of it was recorded 
thirty or forty years ago when the effect of higher edu- 
cation upon the health of young women was far more a 
live issue than it is to-day. Yet Dr. Hall, writing in 
1907, attaches great importance to these opinions on 
the ground that ‘‘the doctor’s objective and personal 
tests and opinions are nearer the truth’’ than are ques- 
tionnaire returns in this field which are likely to be 
vitiated by the fact that college women will be reluctant 
to confess to ill health if such confession may ‘‘con- 
Hall, op. cit., p. 570-71.
-P-A-G-E-96
  86 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
tribute to increase the prejudice against the cause of 
education which she has dearly at heart.’’ 1 
Doubtless questionnaires are open to this criticism, 
as well as to the further objection that women may not 
be able accurately to recall and judge of their health 
and its symptoms after the passage of years. But is 
not an even more serious objection to be raised against 
the opinions of physicians? As Dr. Hollingworth has 
pointed out, ‘‘it should be obvious to the least critical 
mind that normal women do not come under the care 
and observation of physicians.’?’ These men would 
seem to be precisely the individuals least fitted by the 
nature of their experience with a selected group of 
invalid or semi-invalid women to judge of the effects 
of higher education upon the many. 
The evidence furnished by questionnaires may be 
briefly summarized. Most valuable and oft-cited is 
the investigation undertaken by the Association of 
Collegiate Alumnz in 1884, the results of which were 
published the following year by the Massachusetts Bu- 
reau of Labor Statistics.2_ The questions included in 
the inquiry covered the three main heads of (1) child- 
hood conditions, (2) individual health, and (3) tables 
of comparison. The questionnaire was sent out to 
1,290 women graduates of twelve colleges and uni- 
versities and replies were received from 705. The re- 
sults may be summed up in general as follows:— 
PERCENTAGE IN PERCENTAGE IN PERCENTAGE IN

The comparison tables further showed that 138 
young women, or 19.6 per cent., reported a deteriora- 
tion in health during the college period; 418, or 5.93 per 
cent., no alteration; 149, or 21.1 per cent., an improve- 
ment. Thus there were nearly 2 per cent. more stu- 
dents in the group that showed a gain in health than 
in the group reporting a loss. Moreover, as Dewey 
has pointed out, of the 138 students whose health had 
deteriorated, 42 reported a decline from excellent to 
good, which probably represents a slight change. The 
causes of the disorders reported by 417 out of the 705 
women are noteworthy: 
Constitutional weakness 
Bad sanitary conditions 
Intellectual overwork ......... 
Emotional strain ............ 
Physical accidenta ys 6.525 Sos es vee. 
The part played by overstudy in producing ill health 
seems not to have been very great, although twenty per 
cent. of those studying severely reported poor health 
as against 15 per cent. of those studying moderately. 
438 students, or 62.13 per cent., studied moderately ; 
64, or 9.08 per cent., between moderately and severely, 
and 199, or 28.22 per cent., severely. With regard to 
worry as a factor in ill health the following figures are 
interesting. Twenty-four and four tenths per cent. of 
the students worried over their studies; 12.62 per cent. 
worried over personal affairs; 18.58 per cent. worried 
over both studies and personal matters; and 44.4 per 
cent. worried over neither. Of those who had no wor- 
ries 92 per cent. were in fair or good health. The tables 
seem to show, then, that worry was the most potent of 
all the predisposing causes of disease among these 
students. 
   
-P-A-G-E-98
  88 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
Summing up the evidence Professor Dewey re- 
marks: 
“These returns for the most part tell their own tale and point their 
own moral. They certainly bear out the conclusion drawn regarding 
the uninjurious effect of collegiate study. Their great defect is in 
their failure to show more definitely the conditions and surroundings 
of college life. The physical, social, and moral environment should 
be carefully studied. It has long been a commonplace of vital science 
that intellectual pursuits for men per se are healthy. The question 
which needs solution is: What conditions prevent their being equally 
healthy for women, the exact part played by each factor, and how 
far it is removable?” * 
Commenting on the same figures Carroll D. Wright 
says: 
“The graduates, as a body, entered the college in good health, 
passed through the course of study without material change in health, 
and since graduation, by reason of the effort required to gain a 
higher education, do not seem to have become unfitted to meet the 
responsibilities or bear their proportionate share of the burdens of 
life. It is true that there has been, and it was to be expected that 
there would be, a certain deterioration in health on the part of some 
of the graduates. On the other hand, an almost identical improve- 
ment in health for a like number was reported, showing very plainly 
that we must look elsewhere for the causes of the greater part of 
this decline in health during college life. If we attempt to trace the 
cause we find that this deterioration is largely due, not to the require- 
ments of college life particularly, but to predisposing causes natural 
to the graduates themselves, born in them, as it were, and for which 
college life or study should not be made responsible.” 2 
The statistics collected by the Association of Collegi- 
ate Alumne not only aroused much interest and in- 
terpretative comment in this country but they sug- 
gested a similar investigation of the health of women

students at Oxford and Cambridge. The English com- 
mittee conducting the investigation improved upon the 
method of the American Association by instituting a 
parallel inquiry in regard to the health of the sisters 
of the English students who were not in college. In 
order to make the conditions of the parallel research 
as nearly as possible the same, the sister nearest in 
age, or failing a sister the first cousin, of the college 
woman was selected and a set of questions was sent to 
her similar to that furnished the students. We are 
indebted to the English report for a table of compari- 
son of the health of American and of English students 
and of the sisters of the latter at various periods of 
life, including the college stage. The report is given 
below:

Rather surprisingly the health of American students 
proved to be better than that of their English cousins 
and even more superior to that of the English girls 
who did not go to college. Of course the inferiority 
in health of the last named group may have been and 
probably was a determining factor in their decision 
not to enter college. Nevertheless the superiority in 
health of the college women during their years of study 
is noteworthy as the figures show:

Of the 78 cases in the English group reporting de- 
terioration in health in college 65 cases were shown 
to be slight whereas 8 were more serious. The deteri- 
oration was merely temporary in 36 cases. In regard 
to these cases the English report concludes that the 
“temporary falling off during college life of about five 
per cent in good health, compared with either health 
at entering or present health, to some extent depends 
on illness or other things occurring accidentally during 
the college course, and to some extent is probably due 
to the relaxing climate of our universities; but it is 
also partly caused by overwork and want of attention 
to well-known laws of health, and to this extent both 
could and ought to be prevented by reasonable care 
on the part of the students themselves.’’ ? 
There can be no question that the value of the Ameri- 
can study was materially lessened by the fact that no 
control records were made of the health of sisters or 
cousins who did not go to college. The English report 
repaired this omission and at least suggests that a 
similar comparative study of the health of the college 
and non-college women in America would show results 
equally favorable to the college student. In 1895 a 
comparison of the health of women and men students 
was furnished by Preston in his study of the Influence

200 college girls only 2.75 per cent. dropped their work 
because of ill health as compared with 2.85 per cent. of 
Amherst college men. The study, however, was too 
limited in numbers to be of much value. 
The critic of higher education for women may point 
out at this juncture that the evidence given above was 
collected many years ago and may be totally contra- 
dicted by existing facts. This cannot be gainsaid. 
Yet it is highly probable that the reason no recent 
studies of the health of women college students have 
been made is precisely because the question is not a 
live issue in this year of our Lord 1923. Women have 
demonstrated to the satisfaction of most individuals 
that they are capable of carrying on four or more 
years of higher study without detriment to health. 
Especially is this true in those colleges where deans 
and matrons are appointed to have oversight of the 
social life and health of students and where ample 
provision is made for gymnastic training and out-of- 
door sports. 
Effects of Functional Periodicity upon the Efficiency 
of Women.—There remains for brief consideration the 
special question of the effect of the menstrual period 
upon the “physical and mental efficiency of college 
women—a matter on which Dr. Hall and his supporters 
lay greatest stress. Maudsley, writing in 1874, says 
on this point in comparing men and women: 
“This is a matter of physiology, not a matter of 
sentiment; it is not . . . a question of two bodies and 
minds that are in equal physical condition, but of 
one body and mind capable of sustained and regular 
hard labor, and of another body and mind which

for one-quarter of each month, during the best 
years of life, is more or less sick and unfit for hard 
work.’ ! 
Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the fore- 
going statement is its complete ignoring of the fact 
that since the dawn of human history women have en- 
gaged in hard and often continuous toil from morning 
till night in their own households. The most meagre 
study of the history of woman’s life and the most 
casual survey of the manuals of household industry 
prepared for her use from the seventeenth century 
onward would serve to convince a resolute sceptic 
that women have performed a vast amount of exact- 
ing physical labor for many centuries. Half sick 
or not, they have been forced to keep their households 
running smoothly, and they have done so.- Moreover 
the scholastic records women have made in the field of 
higher education and the honors they have won would 
seem to disprove the claim that they were ‘‘unfit for 
hard work.’’ 
Another author holding similar views to those of 
Dr. Hall is Havelock Ellis. He writes with convic- 
tion of ‘‘a monthly physiological cycle which influences 
throughout the month the whole of a woman’s physical 
and psychic organism. Whatever organic activity we 
investigate with any precision, we find traces of this 
rhythm. While a man may be said, at all events 
relatively, to live on a plane, a woman always lives on 
the upward or downward slope of a curve.’’ 2 
Not a great deal of statistical and experimental evi- 
dence showing the effect of the menstrual period on

women’s physical and mental powers exists at present. 
The investigation made by the Association of Col- 
legiate Alumne disclosed the fact that of 705 women 
students 239 abstained from physical work, 2 from 
mental and 73 from both, during their periods. The 
study also disclosed that 53 per cent. of the students 
were subject to pain and irregularity in the years 
before entering college, 66 per cent. during college 
life and 64 per cent. after graduation. Apparently 
those young women who entered college four or five 
years after the beginning of menstruation fared better 
in the matter of health than those who entered one 
or two years after. The figures show that of those 
beginning college work at sixteen or less 28 per cent. 
deteriorated in health and 17 per cent. gained; of 
those who entered over twenty, 18 per cent. lost and 
28.5 per cent. gained. An inquiry concerning the num- 
ber who abstained from study during their periods 
brought out that 55 per cent. abstained in women’s col- 
leges and 25 per cent. in coeducational institutions,—a 
striking contrast in numbers! ! 
The above figures furnish important evidence that in 
the case of American girls a distinct gain to health is 
secured by entering college several years after the men- 
strual function has begun. On the other hand, the 
study of the Health Statistics of Women Students of 
Oxford and Cambridge made in 1885 shows that the 
average age for entering college in England was 21.9 
years, whereas in America it was 18.35 years—more 
than three and a half years earlier. Yet the health 
of American girls at entrance and during the college

course was, on the whole, better than that of their Eng- 
lish cousins.? 
With regard to the number of girls refraining from 
study or exercise during their periods, it should be said 
that a time-honored tradition has prevailed that girls 
are incapacitated at such times and should remit work 
in the interests of health. It is highly probable that 
some girls refrain from study simply because of the 
force of this traditional idea and of the advice they 
have received in accord with it. This is the opinion 
of Dr. Clelia Mosher who, after giving the whole sub- 
ject of functional periodicity years of careful investi- 
gation, has published her conclusions in the brief work. 
Health and the Woman Movement, to which more de- 
tailed reference will be made later. 
In a valuable study of Functional Periodicity,’ Dr. 
Leta Hollingworth cites an experiment made by the 
Russian Voitsechovsky, who tested six women daily 
for a considerable period of time in order to discover 
the effect of menstruation upon certain mental proc- 
esses. He concluded that the menstrual period has 
an unfavorable effect upon women’s mental activity. 
More specifically, his results show that the average 
time of choice reaction is lengthened, and its average 
variation increased; concentration is weakened, espe- 
cially in its qualitative aspect; free association is 
somewhat arrested; and the capacity for mental 
work is lowered. Commenting on these results Dr. 
Hollingworth points out that only the graphs were 
presented as evidence by Voitsechovsky, whereas the 
complete data were needed to show their reliability.

-P-A-G-E-105

Two other defects in the experiment were (1) the fact 
that all the subjects understood the nature of the ex- 
periment and thus might have been influenced by the 
realization that they were being tested at a crucial 
moment; and (2) no control tests were made of indi- 
viduals not subject to the menstrual function. More- 
over Dr. Hollingworth records it as her opinion that 
“the graphs presented by Voitsechovsky scarcely bear 
him out in his conclusions. It is at least questionable 
whether the critical periods could be located on these 
curves if they were drawn entirely solid without any 
indication on the graphs themselves as to where 
the periods fall, and submitted to a number of 
judges.’’+ 
In view of the unquestionable need of further exact 
studies to determine the influence of the menstrual 
function upon women’s motor and mental reactions, 
Dr. Hollingworth experimented with eight subjects— 
six normal women and two men—giving a rigidly con- 
ditioned series of tests covering a period of three or 
more months. The tests were given daily at the same 
hour, at first singly and thereafter twice a day. In the 
latter case the record was the average of two trials. 
Two motor tests were given—the tapping test and a 
steadiness test; and two mental tests—color naming 
and saying opposites. Further tests were added of mo- 
tor fatiguability and of speed and accuracy in typewrit- 
ing. The two men received the tests in precisely the 
same way as the women and thus furnished a much 
needed control record. 
In addition to this intensive experiment Dr. Holling- 
worth made a more extensive study of seventeen wo- 
1 Op. cit., pp. 8-9.
-P-A-G-E-106
  96 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
men of Teachers College who volunteered their ser- 
vices for the experiment. Only three of the former 
tests were used, the tapping, the steadiness and the 
opposites test. Instead of being given daily the tests 
were made only on every third day for a period of 
thirty days, thus yielding ten records and including 
at least one menstrual period. 
The results of both the intensive and extensive ex- 
periments are striking and are quoted in full: 
“(1) Careful and exact measurement does not reveal a periodic men- 
tal or motor inefficiency in normal women. 
“(2) No part of the period is affected. 
“(3) Physical suffering seems to affect associational processes ad- 
versely, judging from the two instances here recorded where 
suffering was experienced on the first day. 
“(4) The variability of performance is not affected by functional 
periodicity. 
“(5) No regularly recurring period of maximum efficiency within 
each month is discernible. 
“(6) The ‘cycle’ referred to by Ellis and others is not discovered 
by methods of precision. 
“(7) No agreement is established between curves plotted for pulse, 
blood pressure, temperature, caloric radiation, ete., and the 
curves of work for the mental and motor traits here tested. 
“Tt is astonishing how little support is found in these results for the 
statements quoted earlier in this paper. It is difficult to understand 
such striking disparity between what has been accepted and the 
figures yielded by scientific method.” * 
It may be freely admitted that these findings do not 
establish the theory that women suffer no loss of men- 
tal and motor ability during their menstrual periods. 
The experimenter herself points out that an insuffi- 
cient number of subjects were tested; that only normal 
women were included in the experiment and that the 
1 Op, cit., pp. 94-5,
-P-A-G-E-107

study does not cover all phases of the question of the 
mental and motor abilities of women during menstru- 
ation. Granting these facts, however, this experiment 
represents a gratifying attempt to substitute exact 
scientific methods for mere opinions with regard to a 
moot question of the utmost importance in the educa- 
tion and life work of women. It is to be hoped that 
further studies, embracing much larger numbers of 
subjects, and a wider range of mental and motor tests 
may be available in the near future. 
In summarizing the conclusions of this chapter it 
may be said that the positions taken by Dr. G. Stanley 
Hall and numerous other writers appear to be 
grounded far more upon opinion than upon experi- 
mental evidence. More specifically, their claims that 
the male is the agent of variation and progress; that 
physiological sex differences are paralleled by mental 
sex differences; and that the health of young women, 
especially during functional periodicity, is adversely 
affected by a college course, have by no means been 
established. On the contrary, such scientific evidence 
as exists rather undermines than supports such posi- 
tions. 
What, then, would seem a reasonable answer to the 
question, Shall there be sex differentiation in edu- 
cation? Would it not be found in a straightforward 
recognition of the fact that women are individuals in 
the same sense as men; that education should develop 
their tastes and aptitudes and specialized training 
should fit them for their work in the world—he it 
home-making or journalism—precisely as in the case 
of men? President Thwing has given clear expression 
to this idea when he says:  
-P-A-G-E-108
98 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
“That study is precious which finds the student . .. Therefore, 
one can say, and at once, that the woman as a woman, should not 
take studies different from those that a man takes. One can also 
say that the man, as a man, should not take studies that are different 
from those that a woman takes. One can say at once, and firmly, 
that woman should take those studies which interest and move and 
form her. . . . The studies should be different, not on the ground 
that the one is a man and the other a woman, but they should be 
different on the ground that each is an individual.” *

        CHAPTER IV 
SEX DIFFERENTIATION IN EDUCATION 
FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 
The Social Argument for Sex Differentiation.—The 
readers of the preceding chapter will no doubt be pre- 
pared at this point to declare that a question so com- 
plex as that of adapting education to sex differences 
cannot be satisfactorily treated from the standpoint 
of individual capacities alone. And such, indeed, is 
the case. So many-sided a problem should be ap- 
proached from the point of view of the social situation 
and need, no less seriously and impartially than from 
the side of personal abilities. It will, then, be the pur- 
pose of this chapter to set forth certain conflicting 
views growing out of a social approach to the problem 
and to seek some plan of compromise or reconciliation. 
The case for a very considerable body of thoughtful 
men and women—probably at present a majority—has 
been often presented in literature and by word of 
mouth. President Hyde of Bowdoin College has been 
an appealing spokesman for this influential group and 
a reflective consideration of his ideas may assist us in 
elarifying our own views upon a difficult controversial 
question. At the outset President Hyde attacks the 
mistaken notion that men and women should have 
the same education, the same tasks, and payment in 
the same coin. Boldly he raises aloft the banner of the 
99
-P-A-G-E-110
  100 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
““Womanly Ideal,’’ which, if fulfilled, will give us ‘‘a 
deepening of the differences between men and wo- 
men.’’+ 
And of these differences one of the most funda- 
mental is that of the economic function of men and 
women. With few exceptions ‘‘the manly economic 
ideal is the effective direction of production; the wo- 
manly ideal is the beneficent ordering of consumption.’’ 
Woman’s distinctive economic contribution lies in the 
household realm, in the preparation and serving of 
food, in the clothing of her family, in the nurture and 
individual training of her children. And Dr. Hyde 
generously declares his conviction that this is no less 
honorable a work than commerce or transportation. 
Moreover he harbors no doubt that it is one ‘‘for which 
women are by nature and taste eminently fitted.’’ 
But the author very frankly faces the fact that mil- 
lions of women are pouring into the ranks of industry, 
compelled to earn the whole or a part of their living. 
What kind of employment shall they seek? In Presi- 
dent Hyde’s opinion women should not enter the arena 
of ‘‘conjunctive production,’’ i.e., production deter- 
mined by world forces and carried on in competition 
with other large producers for the general market. 
Rather let woman’s be the more quiet fields of produc- 
tion for immediate consumption, examples of which are 
nursing, teaching, medicine, domestic service, acting, 
typewriting, and factory work. In such callings she 
can succeed without loss of the spirit of service for 
others, of loving devotion, which is so essential a part 
of the ‘‘Womanly Ideal.’’ But if she insists on pushing 
her way into the exclusively masculine sphere of large 
? The College Man and the College Woman, (1906), Ch. X. 
 
-P-A-G-E-111
  FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 101 
scale production she is ‘‘doomed to financial failure.’’ 
Under the conditions of ruthless competition, of fraud 
and deception, of asking and receiving no quarter, 
which prevail in big business enterprises, not one 
woman in a million could hold her own without physical 
or moral deterioration. Men, however, manage to 
make a success in this maelstrom ‘‘without a very large 
proportion of physical breakdowns, and without the 
destruction of their personal character.’’ It would be 
interesting to know President Hyde’s reasons for be- 
lieving that so bitter a competitive struggle as that in- 
volved in mass production under present conditions 
works no moral harm to the man while it spells ethical 
disaster for the woman. None, however, are forth- 
coming. 
According to our author, ‘‘the beneficent ordering of 
consumption’’ is woman’s function no less in the in- 
tellectual than in the economic sphere. What, then, 
should be the womanly ideal in scholarship; what is 
the ‘‘beneficent ordering of intellectual consumption?’’ 
Needless to say Dr. Hyde emphasizes the appropri- 
ation, on the part of women, of the best that science 
literature, art, and nature have to offer and ‘‘inter- 
pretation and expression of these things so that they 
may become interesting’ and enjoyable to others.’’ 
Productive scholarship, the creative gift, is so rare in 
women as to be almost negligible. In the few instances 
where it undoubtedly has been bestowed upon her she 
should seriously ask herself whether she can afford to 
follow its leadings at the risk of happiness. For 
woman’s true happiness lies in radiating joy among 
her family and friends. Men are judged by what 
they do, women by what they are. ‘‘Man’s intellectual 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
work is done like the work of a mill-stream, by con- 
scious and deliberate direction. Woman’s intellectual 
work is done chiefly like that of the sun—by uncon- 
scious and unpretentious radiation.’’ 
The sharp distinction between the functions of man 
as producer and those of woman as consumer extends 
not only to the economic and intellectual fields but to 
the political as well. Since women are (or should be) 
appreciative and discriminating consumers of the bene- 
fits of good government, their intelligent interest in 
and frank criticism of existing conditions are ‘‘most 
welcome.’’ But constructive and organizing work in 
politics, the enactment of laws, the shaping of public 
policy and the conduct of diplomacy are, by edict of 
Nature, the sphere of the productive male. Women 
are given to understand that this is ‘‘rough work’’ 
which, again, men can perform without serious im- 
pairment of character but which women cannot touch 
without a moral deterioration that is mournful to con- 
template and wholly destructive of the feminine ideal 
of loving, unassuming service in the home. 
This sex division of society into a producing and a 
consuming group President Hyde confidently holds to 
be ‘‘grounded in an eternal distinction of nature which 
runs infinitely deeper than any question of merely 
formal right.’’ Therefore in education, as in industry 
and in polities, ‘‘our aim henceforth should not be 
toward a stupid equality, with interchange of imitated 
functions, but toward differentiation,—giving as far 
as possible the direction and control of economic pro- 
duction to strong and forceful men, and the superin- 
tendence and ministry of consumption to wise and 
gentle women; giving for the most part the hard, dry

task of scholarly investigation and formulation to the 
absorbing and protracted toil of men, and the appre- 
ciation of results and the impartation of established 
knowledge to the quick wits of women; giving the strife 
and turmoil, the compromise and diplomacy of politics 
to the firm will and sound judgment of men, and the 
things that make a country worth dying for to the 
warm hearts of our women.’’? 
- Six years after this eloquent plea was written, Dr. 
Harvey, President of Stout Institute, entered the field 
of controversy, employing much the same weapons. 
He, too, is firmly convinced that the work of men and 
women for society is sharply differentiated; therefore 
it is an absurdity to give them the same education. 
Educators have at last seen the necessity of viewing 
education from the standpoint of the needs of society 
and of the state. This has led to an intelligent attempt 
to find out what men need to know and definitely to fit 
them to do their work in the world. The outcome has 
been an immense broadening of the field of educational 
opportunity for men. No less is it necessary to study 
the education of girls with seriousness and from the 
same social standpoint. ‘‘What a woman needs to 
know and to do in order to meet the responsibilities 
that come to her in life is the basic element in deter- 
mining what her education shall be.’’? It is a waste of 
time and energy to fit women for many kinds of work 
which can only be performed by men. Moreover, the 
call for efficiency is heard from one end of this broad 
land to the other—‘‘a demand that educational effort 
shall be directed toward preparing . . . millions to do 
something well that needs to be done in order that they 
1The Oollege Man and the College Woman (1906), pp. 216-17, 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  104 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
and society may be benefited by their increased effi- 
ciency in doing.’’ 
Now, if we look about us, we see that the girl who is 
being educated to-day is the home-maker of to-morrow. 
The home is a universal institution and more than 
three-fourths of the women of America sooner or later 
assume the responsibilities of home-making after mar- 
riage. The problems of intelligent care and nurture 
of children, proper feeding of the family, household 
sanitation, home-furnishing and decoration, and the 
development of the mental and spiritual powers of 
children—these are questions that might well tax the 
wisest minds. They have been women’s problems since 
the beginning of organized society and they will con- 
tinue so to be. Girls can no longer secure the necessary 
knowledge and training to meet these problems in their 
own homes; therefore such education must be fur- 
nished in the schools, even if its introduction means 
‘‘the elimination of some subjects from the curriculum 
which girls have been required to study . . . upon the 
theory of general culture and training.’’ The woman 
is the home-maker; the well-being of the nation de- 
pends upon her efficiency in the home; and that effi- 
ciency is wholly dependent upon specialized training.' 
Facts Opposed to Sex Differentiation.—It is hardly 
necessary to say that these are searching arguments 
resting upon a basis of fact. True it is that a large pro- 
portion of women marry and become efficient or ineffi- 
cient makers of homes. Preliminary figures issued by 
the United States Census Bureau for 1920 show that 
of females between the ages of 35 and 44 years 80.3 
per cent. are married. Moreover, the total percentage

  FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 105 
of married females fifteen years of age and over has 
increased in the decades from 1890 to 1920 from 56.8 
per cent. to 60.6 per cent. The marriage rate for the 
country at large, then, is increasing. 
But is this the whole story? A study of the Census 
Reports shows that, although the marriage rate for the 
entire United States reveals a steady increase during 
three decades, yet in certain industrial areas there has 
been a more or less conspicuous decline in the number 
of marriages per 10,000 of the population. The in- 
dustrial states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Con- 
necticut, and Ohio—the only states having complete 
marriage records for the decades 1870-1900 show a 
marked falling off in the marriage rate.1

Moreover the percentage of single females 15 years 
of age and over is 32.8 in urban communities as com- 
pared with a percentage of only 26.6 in rural communi- 
ties. Compare this last with the percentage of single

106 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
where large numbers of women, skilled and unskilled, 
are engaged in paid employment outside of the home, 
are not favorable to high marriage rates. 
The steady and increasing influx of women into gain- 
ful occupations is, of course, one of the most striking 
phenomena of the twentieth century. Whereas only 
17.4 per cent. of all females ten years of age and over 
were gainfully employed in 1880, 18.8 per cent. were 
so employed in 1900 and 23.4 per cent.—a marked ad- 
vance—in 1910. It is surely a noteworthy fact that of 
all the women in the country between the ages of 21 
and 44 years more than one-fowrth—26.3 per cent.—are 
pursuing paid employments. To be sure this is a 
_ large age-group and the percentage is no doubt ma- 
terially raised by the inclusion of the younger women. 
An age-group of women 35-44 years would probably 
show a sharp falling off in the percentage of women 
gainfully employed owing to the large number who had 
married. : 
In this connection, however, it is well to remember 
that the proportion of married women carrying on 
paid employments outside the home is steadily rising. 
Since issuing the Census of 1910, the Bureau of the 
Census has compiled some further statistics concerning 
married women in gainful occupations in the United 
States. These figures were released in 1917 and they 
tell an interesting tale. To quote from the Report: 
“In 1890 the married formed 14.3 per cent of all women 16 years 
of age and over engaged in gainful occupations. In 1900 this pro- 
portion had increased to 15.9 per cent; and then, from 1900 to 1910 
it jumped to the very high and entirely unprecedented proportion of 
25.4 per cent.”

-P-A-G-E-117
     FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 107 
The Report goes on to declare that this surprising 
increase in married women workers ‘‘is not confined to 
any one occupation or group of occupations nor to any 
one state or group of states.’’ It is a widespread 
phenomenon, although most striking in the Southern 
States where many negro women are gainfully em- 
ployed in agriculture.t 
The range of occupations of the 8,549,399 women 
gainfully employed in 1920? is various enough, from 
manufacturing and domestic service to clerical work 
and professional service. Of the total number of 
workers engaged in 1910 in manufacturing and me- 
chanical industries, 17.1 per cent. were women; and 
of the total number of both sexes in professional serv- _ 
ice 44.1 per cent were women.? It should be remem- 
bered, of course, that this high percentage is no doubt 
due to the very large proportion of women employed 
in teaching. 
These figures clearly point to the fact that ‘‘the old 
order changeth giving place to new,’’ and that the 
society of the twentieth century will be characterized 
by very large accessions of women, married and single, 
into the ranks of paid workers. Even now the figures 
of 1910 are misrepresentative of the number of women 
gainfully employed and the proportion in each type of 
employment. The war has given enormous impetus 
to the entrance of women into the field of gainful work, 
skilled and unskilled. This is so obvious as to be a 
commonplace. Of especial interest is the widening

yrange of occupations which educated women are enter- 
ing. College graduates have proved their worth, not 
alone as teachers, secretaries, and social workers, but 
as designers and draftsmen, as chemists and assayers, 
as business women and as skilled biologists in govern- 
‘ment laboratories. Having tasted the grateful fruit 
of economic independence it is idle to believe that all 
these women will give up their hard-won positions to 
return to the status of a dependent home-worker. 
Despite the undoubted fact, then, that a high pro- 
portion of American women ultimately marry, it is also 
true that a huge army of women is gainfully employed 
in extra-domestic work and that this army is rapidly 
on the increase.1 This fact must surely be taken into 
account in any fair-minded consideration of women’s 
education. The fallacy into which so many persons 
fall in discussing the higher education of women, 
namely, that of regarding present social and economic 
conditions as permanent, has been vigorously attacked 
by Professor Thorndike: 
“Nearly all opinions about the aim of education for girls beg the 
question in a perversely stupid way by supposing the one thing 
which almost surely will not be, namely, that the present modes 
of social, industrial, and domestic life will endure. The present 
training of young ladies would be an insanity if men selected their 
wives for fitness to be mothers or business partners, as in the future 
they very well may do. The present sanctity of the preparer of meals 
and darner of stockings will be as unintelligible as a negro’s fetich 
if we all come to live barefoot in hotels! 
1 Preliminary reports of the 1920 Census released for the press in November, 
1921, show a gain of 473,627 women in gainful employments since 1910. 
This unexpectedly small increase is explained by the Director of the Census 
Bureau as due to a large decrease in the number of women in agriculture 
and in domestic service. All the other occupations show marked increases 
in the number of women employed.
-P-A-G-E-119
  FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 109 
“The wisest practical course for education, here as elsewhere, is to 
encourage rational experimentation, and give play for the survival of 
the fit. Speculative and a priori reasoning are nowhere so risky and 
wasteful as in facts of human social life.” + 
The Economic Independence of Women and Home- 
Making.— Needless to say, the growing preference of 
women for economic independence creates some per- 
plexing problems. Let it be stated at once that probably 
the greater number of women who marry will, for a long 
time to come, if not always, elect to be home-makers 
after marriage. The majority of married women, then, 
are not included in this social problem. Yet there will 
be a large enough minority among the younger genera- 
tion of wives, who choose to carry on their business or 
profession outside the home, to make the question of 
maintaining a household a serious difficulty. It may 
be frankly admitted that this is preéminently a wom- 
an’s problem and one with which women have not 
yet seriously attempted to grapple. In the case of the 
well-to-do the matter is comparatively easy of settle- 
ment, since it is still possible to secure well-trained 
domestic helpers, however limited the supply is becom- 
ing. But for the family of moderate-income the prob- 
lem is far-reaching and difficult. It is hard to see how 
the married woman, who desires to earn her own sup- 
port in congenial work outside the home and who is 
unskilled in domestic tasks, can overcome the hin- 
drances in her path while the present organization of 
household economy remains the same. Wither she 
must neglect her home, hastily performing only the 
most essential tasks of food preparation and cleaning, 
1“Sex in Education,” in the Bookman, XXIII: 214,

  110 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
or she must sacrifice her economic independence, give 
up her chosen work, and devote herself to a round of 
household tasks for which she may have a pronounced 
distaste. However insistent well-meaning men like 
President Hyde and Dr. Harvey may be that house- 
keeping is a vocation ‘‘for which women are by nature 
and taste eminently fitted,’’ there is much evidence to 
show that large numbers of women have no liking and 
small ability for such work, even when they have ac- 
quired an intelligent understanding of food values, of 
textiles, and of sanitation. The deep-rooted tendency 
to view women in the mass and to describe confidently 
the essential qualities of that abstraction called ‘‘Wom- 
an’’ has already been commented upon. For genera- 
tions to come men (and women as well) will continue 
to insist that women are peculiarly qualified by nat- 
ural gifts and taste for the duties of home-keeping. 
The fact that in the past all women were of necessity 
domestic workers and some, at least, very successful 
and contented ones, has blinded many persons to the 
fact that a considerable proportion of housewives in 
every age have not been even tolerable home-keepers; 
and it is a safe inference that these women were either 
indifferent to housekeeping or found it thoroughly 
uncongenial work. 
Shall Education in Home Economics be made Oblig- 
atory?—Where, then, lies the way out? Is it incumbent 
upon education in the interests of society to emphasize 
women’s duties and responsibilities in the making and 
keeping of homes above every other social function? 
To this end shall schools and colleges bend their efforts 
in the direction which Dr. Harvey indicates and train 
every girl and woman in the principles of child care,
-P-A-G-E-121
FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT aha 
food preparation, making of clothing and household 
management—providing hours of laboratory work for 
practical application of the same? No doubt there are 
intelligent people who regard this as an ideal solution 
of the whole vexed problem. But what objections can 
be brought against it? 
Of course the first and most obvious criticism of 
such an educational scheme lies in the social situation 
as outlined above. With a low marriage rate among 
college graduates and a sharply declining marriage 
rate in large industrial centers, it would seem perti- 
nent to ask whether it is a sound social policy to 
compel every girl and woman to spend long hours in 
the study and practice of household economy when 
it is reasonably certain that thousands will never 
marry and have homes of their own. It may be ob- 
jected here that a knowledge of foods, textiles, and 
child care would be valuable to girls even if they remain 
single. But why should this be true for women more 
than for men unless, indeed, a small fraction of them 
are caring for parents or for relatives’ children? In 
such a case it seems reasonable to suppose that they 
might be trusted to avail themselves of the opportuni- 
ties now rather generally furnished by high schools, 
evening classes, and certain colleges offering special- 
ized training. Obviously a high school and college 
requirement in household economy would materially 
reduce the time for securing essential training which is 
at the disposal of young women who desire to be doc- 
tors, chemists, interior decorators, or employment man- 
agers. Education in domestic science, if made obliga- 
tory, would have the effect of training women for one 
vocation when society is demanding that they be effi-
-P-A-G-E-122
  112 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
cient in a hundred different callings. This thought 
was vigorously expressed a few years ago by a woman 
educator : 
“But my objection to the whole movement to ‘redirect’ the educa- 
tion of girls is not that many very good things are not put into the 
redirected curriculum, but that its whole direction is wrong. I cannot 
say that it is not a good thing for some women to know how to cook 
and sew well, for it is indeed both good and necessary to civilized 
life. I cannot say that some of the subjects introduced into a good 
domestic scfence course are not educative and truly scientific, because 
I should he) saying what is not true. But I do believe that the idea 
at the basis of it all is fundamentally false. For the idea is this: 
that one half of the human race should be ‘educated’ for one single 
occupation while the multitudinous other occupations of civilized 
life should all be loaded upon the other half. The absurd inequality 
of the division should alone be enough to condemn it.” * 
But the social inequality that Miss Harkness con- 
demns is not the only objection to such an educational 
policy. It would mean that thousands of women pre- 
paring to enter the professions and skilled vocations 
would be deprived of opportunity to acquire the thor- 
oughness and breadth of theoretical knowledge as well 
as the technical efficiency that men in those pursuits 
would have had time to secure. Surely society is not 
the gainer by an educational arrangement which re- 
quires women to obtain a smattering of two vocations 
instead of a mastery of one. Nor does it appear that 
young women, eager to become proficient bacteriolo- 
gists, teachers, or lawyers will be drawn toward do- 
mestic pursuits by being compelled to take courses in 
cooking and sewing when their interests and aims are 
focussed on quite different fields of work. It would

Monthly, March, 1914.
-P-A-G-E-123
FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 113 
not long escape the attention of these young women 
that social pressure was being brought to bear on them 
to divert their interest toward home-making; and that 
this pressure was operating to diminish their efficiency 
in their chosen vocations, especially when compared 
with that of young men. The reaction of this discovery 
upon their attitude toward the house-keeping arts 
might well be precisely the opposite of that which so- 
ciety sought to develop. 
Is education, then, to encourage women to turn their 
backs upon marriage and the making of homes while 
they fit themselves with single-eyed devotion for a 
career? Such a policy seems neither wise nor inevi- 
table. On the contrary, it is highly desirable that broad 
and thorough courses in household arts and in the care 
of children should be introduced into high schools and 
colleges as well as into the upper grades of elementary 
schools. Furthermore, in the higher schools, deans and 
advisers would do well to call attention to the value 
of these courses for all girls who are interested in the 
field of domestic economy or who expect to be home- 
makers. The dignity and worth of the present-day of- 
ferings in domestic art and science, together with their 
rich social background and their importance in promot- 
ing the well-being of society should be fully appreciated 
by every academic adviser of young women. In ap- 
pealing fashion Professor Alexis Lange has described 
the kind of home economics courses he would wish to 
see introduced into colleges for women: 
“Were I Fortunatus, I should gently twist my wishing-hat, and 
behold, there would be a group of new college courses, each centered 
about the fountain-head of all progress, the home. They would trace 
its evolution; they would reveal its significance in the advance of 
   
-P-A-G-E-124
  114 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
mankind from beasthood to noble manhood and womanhood; they 
would disclose its unrealized ideals; they would deal with conditions 
that make or mar; they would consider the house beautiful and the 
house sanitary; they would apply the principles of efficient organi- 
zation and management; they would wrestle with the problem of 
income and outgo; they would dwell on the relation of the home to 
the school, the church, the state, and the economic order. And a 
system of well-planned exercises would, whenever possible, connect 
insight with practice.” * 
Surely a college program so planned, in which the 
balance between the social and the scientific phases of 
household economy is so happily maintained, may be 
truly liberalizing—as much so as courses in history 
or higher mathematics. Indeed Professor Lange de- 
clares his belief that of several highways to liberal 
culture many women and some men would find this the 
most direct, since its goal would be that of all liberal 
courses—the development of personality. He goes 
further and grants that while such studies would find 
their richest fruition in wifehood and motherhood yet 
“‘their value as educative means would be independent 
of these phases of woman’s experience.’’ 
But it is worthy of note that Professor Lange no- 
where intimates that his ideal course on the home and 
the home-making arts should be made obligatory upon 
women. He clearly intends that it shall be only one 
of many royal roads to liberal education; for he goes 
on to urge the need in women’s colleges of well-or- 
ganized professional courses in preparation for gain- 
ful occupations. His justification of such courses is 
brief but telling. In his opinion each young college 
woman should realize ‘‘that even the first degree, that

Society, III: 480-85, April, 1916.

  FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 115 
of liberal arts, should stand not only for fitness, ae 
also for fitness for something.’’ 
Professional Education of Women and the Home. 
—But if young women are left free to turn their 
backs upon household arts and to elect both the type 
of education and of life career that appeal to them 
shall we not threaten the efficient management of our 
homes and alter their very character? In the opinion 
of the writer the former difficulty may be avoided by 
professionalizing the labors of the home and substitut- 
ing codperative for individual effort in the care of 
children, in food preparation and in house-cleaning. 
The movement to professionalize the work of house- 
keeping, although slow in gaining headway, has of late 
years given signs of some progress. In 1914 the Vienna 
Volkskiichen, established through the efforts of Dr. von 
Kuhn at the close of the Austro-Prussian war, were 
feeding thousands of men and women of the laboring 
classes in every district of the city. At first it was 
planned that the food should be eaten at the kitchens; 
but by a subsequent arrangement it might be carried 
away by the patrons, so that families could enjoy their 
meals in the intimacy of the home. It is not difficult 
to imagine what a boon these peoples’ kitchens must 
have been to over-worked mothers employed in shops 
and factories. No taint of the philanthropic ‘‘soup- 
kitchen’’ is said to have hung about these places, since 
they were managed on strictly business principles. 
Similar kitchens have been established in Germany 
and in the cities of Copenhagen and Christiania. 
Likewise, in 1917, England established community 
kitchens in more than sixty centers, under the direction 
of local boards. A year later national kitchens were 
   
-P-A-G-E-126
    116 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
established by the ministry of food to meet the popular 
need growing out of stringent food conditions. The 
writer of an open letter in the Manchester Guardian 
(1920) says of these kitchens: 
“There may very likely be a permanent place in our social system 
for the national or municipal kitchen. It may revolutionize the 
methods of providing family dinners, and ultimately domestic cookery 
may have to be reckoned among the lost arts, but with a compensat- 
ing gain to woman of freedom from toil and worry and monotony 
in the service of the home.” 
The Woman’s Party in England has not been slow 
to see the value of communal kitchens to working 
women. In the platform of the party appears this 
plank to which its support is pledged: 
“Food rations, accompanied by the development of communal 
kitchens, so as to economize domestic labor, reduce food waste, and 
guarantee to the people the best possible food at the lowest possible 
prices, cooked in the most skillful way, so that its full nutritive value 
may be secured.” 
In America the history of public kitchens has been 
described as ‘‘an epitome of attempts at the develop- 
ment of agencies which undertook to relieve the house- 
wife of some of the burdens of the individual kitchens.’’ 
The New England kitchen, under the management of 
Mrs. Mary Abel, was finally absorbed into the plant 
of the Women’s Industrial and Educational Union of 
Boston,—that organization which has so long been 
wrestling with the problems arising from women’s 
entrance into professional and industrial life. Com- 
munal kitchens have also been established here and 
there in the United States, notably in Carthage, Mis- 
souri, Evanston, Illinois, and Montclair, New Jersey. 
These ventures have been more or less short-lived,
-P-A-G-E-127
FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 117 
although the two last named were probably the most 
successful of any of the pre-war experiments. In some 
instances the families ate at separate family tables in 
communal dining rooms; in other cases the food was 
sent to the homes in hot containers. An interesting 
experiment recently attempted in New York City was 
that of the American Cooked Food Service which fur- 
nished appetizing meals to families of the middle class. 
The food was sent to the homes in metal containers, 
packed in automobiles so that the families had only to 
serve the hot food and sit down to a home table and 
enjoy it. This service was avowedly designed for 
“the young family living on a small salary without 
maid service; the artist in studios; the large family 
in which the mother is verging on physical break-down 
through shortage in domestic help; and others ranging 
from the isolated occupant of the hall bed-room in a 
rooming house, to families living in private houses and 
the highest type of apartment houses.’’ Unfortu- 
nately this promising experiment, after two or three 
apparently successful years, stranded on the rocks of 
finance! Up to the present time, then, the statement 
of a contemporary writer is probably true that Ameri- 
can women have not made even a dent in their prob- 
lem of combining congenial work with the responsi- 
bilities of marriage and motherhood. When the pres- 
sure of housework becomes intolerably heavy, owing to 
the rapid decrease in the number of domestic servants 
and the growing unpopularity of that form of work; 
and when young women in increasing numbers are 
confronted with the alternative of giving up a suc- 
cessful profession for household tasks, in performing 
which they are neither happy nor proficient, then it is
-P-A-G-E-128
118 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
to be hoped that women themselves will attack this 
question with resolution and intelligence. In course 
of time they will work out an answer to the problem of 
maintaining the spiritual atmosphere of a true home 
while carrying on some chosen work outside its walls. 
This discussion by no means seeks to imply that all 
young women will, in course of time, develop a marked 
distaste for domestic work and will eagerly turn to any 
other form of occupation that offers. Such it seems 
reasonably certain, will be far from the true situation. 
One has only to look about in the social life of to-day 
and observe the large number of educated girls and 
women who choose to develop their powers in and 
through the home to dismiss that bugbear forever. 
There will always be, I believe, a goodly proportion of 
women whose best work for society will be done as 
wives and mothers. But while we render those women 
their due share of credit for performing a social serv- 
ice of signal value, let us not, at the same time, frown 
disapprovingly on their sisters who seek to taste the 
joys of home life and motherhood while carrying on a 
gainful occupation. 
But, the reader may ask, will not the character of 
the homes of the wives and mothers in paid employ- 
ments be profoundly altered when cooking, house- 
cleaning, and even child-care are placed largely in the 
hands of experts? Unquestionably the effect of such a 
policy upon family life will be deep and pervasive. 
But that is not necessarily to say that the change would 
be for the worse. Unless we are willing to commit 
ourselves to the doctrine that a home is not a home 
unless three meals a day are cooked in its kitchen, we 
shall have to admit that a family could gather about 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 119 
the table and enjoy a dinner together even if the food 
had been sent in from a communal kitchen. Conceiv- 
ably the interchange of ideas and experiences around 
the family board might go on to more purpose if the 
wife and mother had been engaged in congenial work 
all day rather than in a monotonous round of market- 
ing, cooking, and dish-washing against which she felt 
herself in silent revolt. So with the cleaning of the 
house. If the married woman is a wage-earner she can 
pay experienced cleaning women with modern ap- 
paratus to set her house in order. 
The question of child care is more difficult. Probably 
the majority of married women working outside the 
home would wish to give a year to the personal care 
of a new-born child before returning to their vocation. 
The establishment of neighborhood nurseries and nur- 
sery schools in which little children could have the 
kindliest and most expert care during the hours that 
their mothers were employed would seem to smooth the 
difficulty for many women. Such nurseries and pre- 
kindergarten schools have proved a boon to working 
mothers in London and why not here? In many in- 
stances little children receive far better nurture at the 
hands of professionally trained young women with a 
love of children than their uninformed mothers could 
give them, and wiser guidance in educative play as 
well. But the writer is fully aware of the objections 
that will be raised against such a social arrangement. 
What of the individuality of children thus turned 
over to experts? Can any woman, however highly 
trained and skillful, take the place of a mother in de- 
veloping the individuality of a child? Probably not. 
But will not the mother have an hour or two daily,
-P-A-G-E-130
  
  120 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
lengthening to three or four as the child grows older, 
in which to establish those intimate, sympathetic rela- 
tionships through which a good mother comes to un- 
derstand the capacities for good and evil, the special 
gifts and deficiencies of that human being who is her 
child? Moreover, as the child grows to school and 
later, perhaps, to college age, will not the professional 
mother have a great and ever growing advantage over 
those mothers who are absorbed in domestic pursuits? 
Like their husbands, these women will have kept in 
touch with world currents outside the home and will 
have something to contribute to their mentally develop- 
ing children which is the product of a rich and broad- 
ening experience. 
But there is another side of the question that de- 
serves brief consideration. It would be interesting to 
know how many mothers, ostensibly home makers, 
give to their young children a generous amount of per- 
sonal care. Undeniably some mothers do. But is it 
not a matter of common knowledge that large numbers 
of home-staying women secure nurses for their babies 
who perform for them almost all the physical services 
that the mother is supposed to do? Probably, in the 
homes of the rich and the well-to-do, mothers have no 
more personal association with their babies than moth- 
ers in gainful occupations would have. Motor-parties, 
luncheons, and bridge, as well as serious club work, 
absorb the leisure time of many prosperous women 
with children. Why, then, does not society raise its 
voice against such apparent neglect of children? The 
answer seems to be because these women are ostensibly 
staying at home and playing the historic réle of wives 
and mothers. On the other hand, in the case of women
-P-A-G-E-131
  
FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 121 
of moderate means, most of the care of young children 
is performed by the mother. If she is not over-tired 
and over-strained such care may be ideal. But the 
writer has seen too many educated women of limited 
means who are trying to keep house and care for two 
or three little children, under conditions of fatigue and 
nervous strain, to feel that the results are always even 
moderately satisfactory for either mother or child. 
If the exacting physical care of babies and small chil- 
dren proves wearing to a mother with other domestic 
duties, it is a fair question whether those little ones 
would not be better cared for in a good nursery. The 
love of a mother for her children by no means pre- 
cludes the possibility of tension and even friction be- 
tween them, when the mother is nervously organized 
and not well fitted by taste or training for the constant 
duties which the physical nurture of small children 
involves. That same mother, given congenial work, 
might establish the closest spiritual relationships with 
her boys and girls in those hours of association in the 
family when the day’s school and work were over. 
The Question of Coeducation.—Even if the principle 
be accepted that every human being should be educated 
as a unique individual with a useful social work to per- 
form, there still remains the question whether this edu- 
cation of personality cannot best be carried on, at least 
during adolescent years, when the sexes are separated. 
The policy of coeducation, believed by Europeans to 
have been settled once for all in this country, periodic- 
ally becomes the subject of challenge and discussion. 
About 1870, when the states of the North and North- 
west were extending improved opportunities for higher 
education to their youth, the demand was made that 
   
-P-A-G-E-132
122 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
women share equally with men in these privileges.! This 
demand precipitated a controversy concerning the rela- 
tive capacities and future ‘‘spheres’’ of the two sexes 
which was finally settled by opening all departments of 
the new state universities and agricultural colleges to 
women. A decade later the question was raised again, 
this time with respect to the public high schools rapidly 
springing up in the large cities throughout the country. 
Again the matter was settled by the establishment of 
coeducational high schools in every state of the Union 
except in a few of the larger cities of the Hast, notably 
Boston, New York (Manhattan only), and Baltimore. 
In 1891 the discussion broke out again, more particu- 
larly in the South, where public high schools of first 
grade were being rather tardily established and where 
young women were insistently demanding admission to 
the state universities. Once more the answer has been 
in favor of educating the sexes together. In view of the 
almost universal acceptance of the principle of coedu- 
cation in America whenever the issue has been raised 
it would seem that the question might now be decently 
interred not to be again resurrected. But such is not 
the case. About fifteen years ago the policy again 
became the subject of vigorous controversy and from 
that time to the present its advantages and disadvan- 
tages have been sporadically discussed. Since, then, 
the issue is still a live one in the public mind, it may be 
well briefly to consider the arguments pro and con. 
Coeducation and Health.—A by no means negligible 
body of educators believes that, during the early years 
of adolescence, the health of girls suffers from being 
subjected to the strain of competition with boys in our 
public secondary schools. The hygienic aspects of the
-P-A-G-E-133
  FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 123 
problem of coeducation were ably discussed by Dr. 
Clarke about fifty years ago in his widely read book 
Sea in Education, previously referred to. In brief Dr. 
Clarke urged that, for physiological reasons, girls are 
permanently incapacitated for sustained intellectual 
work without injury to their health, which may reveal 
itself only in later years. About the same time a simi- 
lar argument was advanced by the Englishman Dr. 
Maudsley in a much discussed article in the Fort- 
nightly Review. Dr. Maudsley warned the educators 
of his day that the girl who competes successfully with 
men in high school and college may get on for years 
without giving proper attention ‘‘to the periodical tides 
of her organization’’; but in the long run Nature as- 
serts its power and she is driven to seek medical ad- 
vice. Nor is the vital energy thus drained in the com- 
petitive struggle easily regained. 
Perhaps the mournful prognostications of these 
physicians made nearly fifty years ago, might be passed 
over without serious concern had not the question been 
raised again in more recent times. Some years ago an 
Austrian educator presented some striking figures 
showing the relative percentage of illness of the two 
sexes in the separate high schools of Denmark, Sweden 
and Norway and in the coeducational high schools of 
Finland. The statistics revealed a far larger percen- 
tage of girls than of boys who were ‘‘sickly,’’? and 
troubled with ‘‘habitual headache,’’ and chlorosis. In 
Sweden girls were found to be more sickly than boys 
in every year from 11 to 19 years of age. Also the 
mortality of girls from 12 to 16 years was higher than 
that of boys. From these facts the writer concluded

that the development of puberty in girls represents a 
process in which hygiene is of higher importance than 
in the case of boys, and the observance of hygienic rules 
plays the leading part in the establishment of health. 
Yet, as Burgerstein points out, the burden of study in 
public secondary schools in Hurope grows continually 
heavier. Since the elective system is but meagrely de- 
veloped in these schools and Latin and Greek are com- 
pulsory studies in most of them, girls should not be 
loaded with such a burden as the boys have now to 
bear. They should therefore be educated in separate 
schools; or, if coeducational high schools are estab- 
lished in Europe, the curriculum should be made lighter 
for girls so that they might have more time to spend 
in out-of-door exercise.* 
Another criticism from the aspect of health is 
brought forward by Dr. Julius Sachs, well-known 
in America as an educator in the secondary school 
field. Dr. Sachs charges that coeducation in the 
public high schools of the United States ‘‘has uncon- 
sciously developed in the course of time an adaptation 
to the physical capacities of our girls.’? Women 
teachers unquestionably adapt the class work to the 
strength of the girls; ‘‘and this attenuated demand 
has become so general that our entire secondary school 
system, even where male teachers are largely employed, 
lacks that stimulus of highest attainment which is 
wholesome to every young man....’’ As a result 
girls tend to impair their strength when boys have not 
utilized their full capacities. In Dr. Sachs’s opinion 
the situation is so unsatisfactory that he looks for-

ward to the time when growing prosperity may bring 
about a radical change in the attitude of the American 
people toward coeducation. 
Needless to say these criticisms may tab be lightly 
dismissed. If the health of girls is seriously threat- 
ened by the demands of our coeducational high schools; 
or if the program of these schools is so devitalized, in 
an attempt to adapt it to the physical weakness of girls, 
that boys are not stimulated to their best endeavors 
then the coeducational high school must go. But are 
these strictures well-founded so far as American con- 
ditions are concerned? Unfortunately, as far as the 
writer knows, no careful studies of the relative health 
of boys and girls in our high schools have been made 
at all comparable with those of Burgerstein for selected 
European countries. In the absence of such statistics 
one must proceed cautiously in drawing the conclusion 
that girls do not suffer in health from the work de- 
manded of them in secondary schools. But does not 
the steady growth in numbers and popularity of the 
athletic girl in high school and college furnish solid 
ground for hope that the ‘‘feeble’’ and ‘‘delicate’’ type 
of American woman, so frequently commented on by 
visiting foreigners a generation or more ago, is being 
gradually eliminated? ‘There exists some evidence 
that the American girl of to-day is a more vigorous and 
healthy type than her grandmother or her mother. Dr. 
Jesse Williams, Associate Professor of Physical Edu- 
cation in Teachers College, Columbia University, de- 
clares that he has observed a marked improvement in_ 
the health of girls attending his summer camp during 
the last ten years—an improvement which he attributes 
to their more active participation in out-of-door sports. 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  126 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
More specific evidence to the same effect is furnished 
by Miss Mabel Newcomer in a recent statistical study 
of the Physical Development of Vassar College Stu- 
dents 1880-1921.1 
Miss Newcomer used in her study data obtained from 
the records of the department of physical training, 
covering the period from 1884 to 1920. She selected 
the records made by the entering class of freshmen 
during their first physical examination in the fall. 
The figures show a steady gain in mean height, weight, 
and girth of waist during every five-year period. Also 
there was a continuous improvement in lung capacity 
after 1899, when the spirometer had been perfected 
sufficiently to give reliable records. As the investiga- 
tion failed to disclose the causes of this marked physi- 
cal improvement, Miss Newcomer inferred that it 
might be due to the fact that a larger proportion of 
western girls of pioneer stock had been admitted to 
Vassar in recent years than was the case in its earlier 
history. But an examination of the records failed to 
show any appreciable increase in the number of stu- 
dents from western states. She next formed the 
hypothesis that the physical gain might be caused by 
the more active participation of girls in sports during 
the last decade. Fortunately, records had been kept 
over a period from 1896 to 1920 of the average number 
of sports engaged in by students prior to entering Vas- 
sar. The record by five-year groups is as follows:

FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 127 
The widespread interest of girls in out-of-door sports 
and games during the last ten years seems largely re- 
sponsible for their steady gain in height, weight, girth 
of waist, and lung capacity—all indices to some extent 
of health and vigor. Needless to say, similar studies 
both of high school girls and college women, would be 
of the greatest service in showing that, under proper 
conditions of out-door exercise and recreation, and 
with observance of sensible, hygienic rules, normally 
healthy girls can carry the work demanded in public 
high schools with an actual physical gain. 
But even if the attendance records of secondary 
schools showed (as they well might) that the per- 
centage of absences among girls is higher than 
among boys, would that be an argument against co- 
education? It might be if the theory could be proven, 
as Dr. Sachs believes it is, that the more nu- 
merous absences of the girls hold back the boys 
from advancing in the various subjects as rapidly 
as they are capable of doing. Long ago Dr. W. T. 
Harris, when Superintendent of Public Schools in St. 
Louis, investigated this phase of the problem of coedu- 
cation. He found that the average attendance of boys 
in high schools in the country at large was less than 
75 per cent. although it rose to 90 per cent. in some city 
schools. Furthermore, although the percentage of ab- 
sence of girls in the St. Louis high schools was some- 
what larger than that of boys, Dr. Harris does not 
hesitate to say that ‘‘the statistics of the attendance of 
girls—compared with that of their percentage in 
scholarship, does not allow us to conclude that the 
progress of the classes suffers on their account—it is 
safe to say that no practical difficulty is experienced 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  128 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
in the high schools on account of the larger per cent. of 
absence of the girls.’’ + 
Of course Dr. Harris’s testimony of itself does not 
dispose of the claim that coeducation in high schools 
results in a lowering of standards and requirements 
to the physical level of girls and thus fails to stimulate 
boys to their best efforts. Yet it seems reasonably 
certain that if such were the state of affairs educators 
in considerable numbers would long ago have discov- 
ered it and led a crusade against these conditions. 
Moreover, there appears to be little or no evidence 
that the work of boys, segregated in separate high 
schools (as in some eastern cities) is superior to that 
of boys in coeducational schools. A thorough-going 
investigation of this question would be of great value 
in solving the many-sided problem of coeducation. 
Argument from the Standpoint of Mental Differ- 
ences.—As we have seen, Dr. Maudsley’s article on 
Sex in Mind and in Education, written in 1874, raised a 
furore of controversy with respect to the policy of 
coeducation. Holding that the brain is in closest physi- 
ological sympathy with other organs of the body, Dr. 
Maudsley was led to proclaim that the reproductive 
organs exercise a profound influence upon feelings and 
ideas, desires and will, causing these mental states to 
be sharply different in the two sexes. Therefore he 
declared that ‘‘to aim by means of education and pur- 
suits in life to assimilate the female to the male mind 
might well be pronounced as unwise and fruitless a 
labor as it would be to strive to assimilate the female 
to the male body by means of the same kind of

-P-A-G-E-139
FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 129 
physical training and by the adoption of the same 
pursuits.’ 
For many years this article furnished an armory 
of weapons freely drawn upon by opponents of ‘‘mixed 
education.’’? That its influence is still not wholly negli- 
gible is evidenced by the reprinting of the article in 
1918 in the Educational Review. But, in view of the 
intellectual achievements of women in high schools and 
colleges, there are few educators to-day who can be 
induced to align themselves under the banner of this 
doctrine. Experience and ample statistics alike dis- 
prove it, as has been shown in the preceding chapter. 
However, this does not prevent the opponents of co- 
education from declaring that, owing to temperamental 
differences, girls feel the strain of high school work far 
more than boys and should therefore not be urged for- 
ward in their studies but rather held back. This group 
points to the greater conscientiousness of girls, and 
to their extreme sensitiveness to approval and disap- 
proval, as evidence that they should be educated in 
separate schools, where the driving methods, appro- 
priate to boys, will be wholly eliminated. The question 
concerning the greater affectability and conscientious- 
ness of girls, when compared with boys, is still a moot 
point. That women do appear to have these tempera- 
mental traits in larger measure than their brothers 
cannot be gainsaid. But how far they are due to in- 
herent differences in the sexes and how far to ages of 
social suggestion and pressure upon women to walk 
the strait path of duty remains undetermined. It 
might not be too daring a hypothesis to suggest that 
when studious girls are relieved from the extra burden 
of home tasks, so often required of them, and encour- 
   
-P-A-G-E-140
130 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
aged to spend this time in healthful sports, as boys 
have always done, these supposed temperamental dif- 
ferences will vanish into thin air. Certainly the 
athletic type of girl in our midst to-day shows no more 
undue concern over her studies than her brother! 
There still remains for brief consideration the criti- 
cism that coeducation does not allow for differences in 
physiologic age and mental development. Girls ma- 
ture earlier than boys, both physiologically and men- 
tally; and the charge is made that boys never catch 
up with girls during the high school period. Dean Rus- 
sell declares that the inferiority of boys is noticeable in 
any high school class, with the result that they tend to 
become accustomed to ‘‘second best’’ achievement. In 
Dean Russell’s opinion this condition is the ‘‘strongest 
argument for separation of the sexes.’’ 
In meeting this objection it is necessary to examine 
the evidence to ascertain whether the earlier mental 
maturity of girls actually does result in marked in- 
feriority on the part of boys in high school work. The 
studies of high school grades made independently by 
Thorndike and Miss Rusk do not tend to support this 
theory.1. Thorndike’s estimate of the percentage of 
boys who equalled or exceeded the median of the girls 
in English, mathematics, Latin, and history, showed 
that the boys excelled in every subject except English. 
Miss Rusk’s study revealed that the boys’ percentage 
exceeded the median of the girls in geometry, chemis- 
try, and physics and almost equalled it (49 per cent.) in 
history. In English, Algebra, Latin, and German, the 
girls showed a superiority. Such ‘‘inferiority’’ as boys 
reveal in high school studies commonly lies in the field

FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 131 
of the humanities and is offset by their superiority to 
girls in the sciences. It is highly probable that the dif- 
ferences in both cases are due to social circumstances 
rather than original nature, although this remains to 
be fully proved. 
Coeducation and V ocations.—But the attacks leveled 
against the policy of educating the sexes together are 
not limited to the physiological and psychological as- 
pects of the problem. An influential group criticises 
coeducation mainly on the ground that high schools and 
colleges do not adapt their curricula to the future needs 
of women but ‘‘toss them into the educational hopper 
with the men.’’ In consequence girls discover at gradu- 
ation ‘‘a rigid wall of professional opportunity in 
which every gateway bears the sign ‘No thoroughfare 
except for men.’ ’’ Of course this criticism means that 
many sincere and intelligent people still believe that 
woman’s sphere and woman’s interests have not ma- 
terially changed since the eighteenth century nor are 
they destined to undergo further transformations. It 
follows that these men and women urge the necessity 
of ‘‘an education that will prepare [women] for em- 
ployments in which by nature and the customs of civ- 
ilized society they are destined to be engaged.’’ 1 
As this argument has been met in a previous section 
of this chapter, it needs only to point out once more 
the fluid character of our age, the tremendous changes 
that are taking place in every aspect of woman’s life, 
and the very wide variety of gainful employments they 
are pursuing both before and after marriage. But even 
if this were not so, the criticism would hardly consti-

  132. THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
tute a valid’ objection to coeducation, since the neces- 
_ sary differentiations in the curriculum for girls would 
“not necessitate their being educated in separate schools 
—a demonstrably expensive method. They could still 
meet with boys in history, language, and mathematics 
classes, even if their science were specialized with ref- 
erence to the fields of home economics, household sani- 
tation, and child hygiene. 
Social and Moral Aspects of Coeducation—Among 
the most serious charges brought against coeduca- 
tion in high schools are those based upon its un- 
desirable social and moral consequences. Many 
thoughtful people believe that the education of boys 
and girls together during early adolescence tends to 
make girls rough and rude in manners, while the boys 
(having the stronger personality) do not become 
gentler and more considerate because of their daily 
association with girls. In this connection it is inter- 
esting to note that Dr. G. Stanley Hall brings pre- 
cisely the contrary criticism, namely, that boys are 
made too effeminate when educated with girls; whereas 
‘‘in order to be well virified later,’? boys probably 
ought to be permitted to be so boisterous and rough as 
not to be fit companions for girls. Girls should be al- 
lowed ‘‘to have their sentimental periods of insta- 
bility,’’? while boys ‘‘need a different discipline and 
moral regimen and atmosphere.’’ 
Deplorable as this is, worse is yet to come. For we 
are assured that there ‘‘is a little charm and bloom 
rubbed off the ideal of girlhood by close contact, and 
boyhood seems less ideal to girls at close range. In 
place of the mystic attraction of the other sex that 
has inspired so much that is best in the world, fa-
-P-A-G-E-143
FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 133 ~ 
miliar camaraderie brings a little disenchantment. This 
disillusionizing weakens the motivation to marriage 
sometimes on Hoth sides, when girls grow careless in 
their dress and too negligent in their manners . . . and 
when boys lose all restraints which the presence of girls 
usually enforces, there is subtle deterioration.’ 1 
This is truly a discouraging picture! but perhaps 
a few discriminating souls may take heart from the 
fact that its details somehow fail to reproduce their 
own experience and observation with respect to the 
association of high school boys and girls. Moreover, 
the frank camaraderie of high school youth of both 
sexes appears to some of us as so precious and desir- 
able a thing to bring about that we are willing to run 
the risk of some ‘‘disillusionizing’’ and the loss of part 
of the ‘‘mystic attraction’’ of one sex for the other. 
A more serious criticism is brought by Dr. Hall and 
dthers against coeducation in high schools on the 
ground that boys and girls in their teens are best re- 
moved from a situation which provokes ‘‘half conscious 
cerebrations about wedlock.’’ This deserves thought- 
ful consideration. Unquestionably at this period of 
their lives, when rapid physiological changes are tak- 
ing place, sex attraction may be so strong as to in- 
terfere with serious intellectual’ work. The remark is 
attributed to Edward Howard Griggs that ‘‘ado- 
lescence is the time when girls are all legs, no feathers 
and always to be found in the front yard.’’? A respec- 
table body of evidence has been furnished the writer 
by high school teachers of experience which goes to 
1 Adolescence, II: 620-21. 
2 Since the front yard is obviously the best vantage ground from which to 
view the comings and goings of boys, the remark will not be challenged 
by those acquainted with the adolescent girl and her ways. 
   
-P-A-G-E-144
  134 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
show that in every high school class there are some 
boys and girls so stimulated by the presence of the 
other sex that they fail to do their best work. John’s 
mind is too often occupied with the impression he 
is making on Jane or with their next social ‘‘date’’ and 
the same is true of Jane. One teacher of long ex- 
perience recently expressed the view that she would 
educate boys and girls together during the first two 
years of high school and segregate them during the 
last two years when sex consciousness is much more 
acute. Out of this heightened sex attraction she had 
seen grow romances ‘‘that no sane person would try 
to check’’ and also ‘‘a silliness that, if it does no more, 
vastly interferes with work.’’ No doubt many edu- 
cators could match the cases this teacher cited of a 
boy of seventeen ‘‘completely razzle-dazzled through 
his last year by a golden-haired vamp who had no idea 
of marrying him’’; and of girls removed from high 
school by anxious parents because their ‘‘heads are 
just full of boys’’ and the parents won’t have them 
‘<spoiled.’’? But it is pertinent to ask whether the 
danger is removed by segregating the young people 
in separate schools. Will they not make use of every 
opportunity, innocent or otherwise, of seeing each 
other out of school? These are the highly sexed boys 
and girls whose heads will be full of the other sex in 
any case. Moreover, they usually constitute a small, 
though troublesome, minority in any school, as even 
the opponents of coeducation admit. Should they be 
permitted to overthrow a system which has worked 
with signal advantages to the majority of students over 
a period of more than fifty years? Rather it would 
seem that every effort should be made by school and 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 135 
home in codperation to develop in these boys and girls 
habits of self-control and standards of wholesome com- 
panionship when they are thrown together. Segrega- 
tion will only add to the mystery and allurement of 
each sex for the other and will encourage those ‘‘gos- 
siping groups’’ so frequently commented upon by 
teachers in separate schools. 
On the affirmative side the strongest argument for 
coeducation is probably the fact that if our boys and 
girls do not come to know each other in school days 
they will all their lives be hampered by ignorance of 
one another’s differences of temperament, capacity and 
fundamental interest. Both will suffer and, as one 
writer puts it, will ‘‘find it difficult to run in the har- 
ness of married life.’”? Wholesome comradeship and 
sane competition in intellectual pursuits, in the course 
of which each sex learns to respect the abilities of the 
other, would seem to be a sure foundation on which 
to build the romance of later years. 
One further aspect of the problem of coeducation re- 
mains to be considered, and that is the effect upon sex 
morals. ‘‘Silliness’’? and romantic dreaming are un- 
desirable enough; but unfortunately boys and girls of 
high school age do not always stop there. Some evi- 
dence there is to show that positive immorality has 
been discovered among high school students too late 
to prevent a train of tragic consequences. In the 
words of an experienced teacher: ‘‘I could tell some 
sad tales of waves of impurity that crept in a subtle 
stream through a school, and of the occasional tragedy 
from which no school is ever quite secure.’? And 
another teacher refers to several cases of immoral 
intercourse which had occurred in the same school 
   
-P-A-G-E-146
  136 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
within a year or two, one of which resulted in the 
suicide of the girl. 
But it may fairly be questioned whether coeducation 
is responsible for these tragedies and whether they do 
not occur in places where the sexes are educated in 
rigidly separated schools. It is highly improbable 
that sexual immorality is less prevalent among the 
boys and girls of France and England, who are edu- 
cated separately, than it is in America or in those 
cities of our country where coeducation in high schools 
does not exist. Is it reasonable to believe that the 
boys and girls in the high schools in New York City, 
where the sexes are segregated, are more ‘‘moral’’ 
than in Brooklyn or Philadelphia where they are edu- 
cated together? 
But there is another aspect of this question which 
cannot be ignored. A mass of testimony is furnished 
by English teachers, now teaching in coeducational 
schools, who had once taught in the separate boys’ 
schools of England, to the effect that the moral tone of 
the ‘‘mixed school’’ is far more wholesome. One Eng- 
lish educator does not hesitate to say that ‘‘the monas- 
tic system in schools is the stronghold of immorality.’’ 
He refers, of course, to those secret vices which are 
known to flourish among boys and men when they are 
segregated for long periods of time from the society 
of women. ‘‘Whenever it has fallen to my lot,’’ he 
writes, ‘‘to meet in conversation any of the head- 
masters of our Public Schools, I have endeavoured al- 
ways to ask this question: Do you consider that it is 
possible to root out from a large school the vice of 
immorality? The sadness of the answers has varied 
only in degree. Whilst some have seemed to regard   
-P-A-G-E-147
FROM A SOCIAL VIEWPOINT 137 
this inevitable presence almost with resignation, others 
have shown that it is to them a veritable horror, cast- 
ing its dark shadow over all their experience.’’ 
The experience of Mr. Grant receives support from 
the oft-quoted statement of Jean Paul Richter: ‘‘To 
insure modesty I would advise the education of the 
sexes together; for two boys will preserve twelve 
girls, or two girls twelve boys, innocent amidst winks, 
jokes, and improprieties, merely by that instinctive 
sense which is the forerunner of natural modesty. But 
I will guarantee nothing in a school where girls are 
alone together, and still less where boys are.’’ Be it 
noted that Richter regards the moral benefits accruing 
from coeducation as mutually affecting boys and girls. 
And such, indeed, appears to be the case. A flood 
of light has recently been thrown upon the sex life 
of girls which tends to show that, although vicious 
sex practices may be less prevalent in girls’ schools 
than in boys’, nevertheless unwholesome gossip about 
sex is very common. Furthermore, the tendency of 
girls to develop ‘‘crushes’’ seems to be far more 
marked in separate girls’ schools than in coeducational 
institutions. And the potentialities for evil of these 
sentimental affairs between girls are too well known 
to need more than passing comment. 
Summary.—With due allowance for the disadvan- 
tages alleged to follow upon coeducation, it would seem 
that, from every point of view, its benefits far outweigh 
its defects. The evil effects upon the health of girls, 
as confidently prophesied more than a generation ago, 
have not appeared. Their capacity to keep abreast of

-P-A-G-E-148
  138 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
the intellectual work demanded of them has been 
abundantly demonstrated. Although the pressure of 
studies upon over-conscientious girls and those ex- 
pected to do household tasks in their free time is 
over-heavy, the way out appears to lie in the active 
encouragement of athletics for girls and the deliberate 
attempt to draw every girl into out-door sports. The 
establishment of a variety of courses in coeducational 
high schools to meet the varied vocational needs of 
boys and girls enables the latter to fit themselves in 
some measure for the vocation of housewife and mother 
on the one hand or for gainful employment on the other. 
Finally, the social and moral advantages of educating 
the sexes together appear to the writer to be far 
more real than the concomitant disadvantages. Where- 
as a few boys and girls may be over-stimulated in each 
other’s society, this seems rather a challenge to a more 
intelligent understanding and direction of these types 
than an argument for the abolition of coeducation. If 
men and women are to live and work, play and aspire 
together, they must grow into mutual understanding 
and respect. And this can best come about through a 
common education which reveals to each the strength 
and weakness, the aptitudes and limitations of the 
other.

CHAPTER V 
CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 
The Historic Divorce of Liberal and Practical Edu- 
cation.—The student of educational history cannot 
fail to be struck by the power of the written word, 
the tremendous sway of the symbol in education. As 
soon as a people had developed a written language so 
soon did its education tend to withdraw itself from con- 
temporary experience in order to impart to the young 
the social interpretations of past generations as con- 
tained in manuscripts and books. This is of course 
not to decry the importance of symbols as an indis- 
pensable factor in education but only to point out that, 
because of the supreme value attached to the written 
word, to the neglect of contemporary experience, edu- 
cation tended to become bookish and increasingly 
remote from every-day life. In the course of centuries, 
as vast bodies of knowledge developed and were or- 
ganized, traditions grew up concerning the relative 
values of these knowledges. The utmost importance 
came to be attached to those interpretations of life, in 
its many-sided aspects, given to the world by the youth- 
ful and vigorous nations of Greece and Rome. Much 
later, science fought its way to recognition and at- 
tained a secondary place in the curriculum of schools 
and universities. It remained true, however, among 
all civilized peoples that education preéminently was 
141 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  142 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
concerned with mastery of the printed page, or to use 
Matthew Arnold’s phrase, ‘‘ with the best that has been 
thought and said in the world.’’ In the dixteenth cen- 
tury culture became so identified with symbols almost 
to the exclusion of vital experience that Erasmus was 
moved to write: ‘‘All knowledge falls into one of two 
divisions: the knowledge of ‘truths’ and the knowledge 
of ‘words’: and if the former is first in importance the 
latter is acquired first in order of time. . . . For ideas 
are only intelligible to us by means of the words which 
describe them; wherefore defective ve of lan- 
guage reacts upon our apprehension of the truths ex- 
pressed.’ + 
Side by side with respect for letters developed the 
conception of knowledge as an end in itself. This 
ideal of knowledge for knowledge’s sake id dominant 
more than two thousand years ago among the Greeks, 
was passed on to the Romans and then to the peoples 
of Western Europe during the Renaissance. Most 
clearly of all his countrymen Aristotle voiced the feel- 
ing of educated Greeks that study and research for its 
own sake, the life of reason as an end in itself, is the 
highest good of man. A liberal education, in Aris- 
totle’s view, is liberal in proportion to its divorce 
from practical affairs; and conversely an illiberal edu- 
cation is one primarily concerned with training for 
useful occupations. As Professor Dewey has so il- 
luminatingly pointed out, the wide gulf existing in 
Greece between liberal and menial education, between 
the cultural and the practical arts, was the natural out- 
come of the existing chasm between the laboring class 
1*De Ratione Studii,” in Woodward, Hrasmus concerning Education, 
p. 162. Italics mine. 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 143 
(largely made up of slaves) and the leisured class. 
To quote Professor Dewey: ‘‘The conception that 
liberal education, adapted to men in the latter class, 
is intrinsically higher than the servile training given 
to the former class reflected the fact that one class was 
free and the other servile in its social status. The 
latter class not only labored for its own subsistence, 
but also for the means which enabled the superior class 
to live without personally engaging in occupations tak- 
ing almost all the time and not of a nature to engage 
or reward intelligence.’ + 
So passionately did Aristotle hold to the ideal of 
rational activity as an end, bearing within itself its own 
satisfying rewards, that he even distinguished between 
the exercise of reason in practical and political affairs 
and the life of reason for its own sake. Again Pro- 
fessor Dewey makes the contrast sharp and clear: 
‘Wor there is a distinction in ends and in free action, 
according as one’s life is merely accompanied by rea- 
son or as it makes reason its own medium. That is to 
say, the free citizen who devotes himself to the public 
life of his community . . . lives a life accompanied by 
reason. But the thinker, the man who devotes him- 
self to scientific inquiry and philosophic speculation, 
works, so to speak, in reason, not simply by it.’’ 2 
The origin of the historical antithesis between liberal 
and practical education, as springing from the division 
between the laboring and the ee ae is again 
made plain in the social history of the Roman people. 
The high regard of the citizens of the early-Republic 
for the man who tilled his own lands and engaged in

144 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
other forms of manual work disappeared only when 
Rome’s wars for conquest filled her cities and villas 
with an enslaved class and created the old distinction 
between the servile toiler and the educated man of 
leisure. In modern society the gulf between the classes 
has been somewhat lessened by the growth of a moral 
sentiment against slavery that has led to its abolish- 
ment among civilized nations. But who would be 
blind enough to maintain that the same clear-cut 
division between the toilers in mine and factory, 
meagerly educated in the common schools, and the 
propertied class who enjoy the benefits of leisure and 
a liberal education does not still persist in our present 
day industrial society? In consequence, the inevitable 
opposition between cultural and vocational studies has 
made itself felt throughout the educational system of 
America, more especially in its higher stages. 
It is a hopeful index of the genuine character of our 
democracy that this distinction in educational values 
has not escaped adverse criticism. This criticism, 
pungently expressed, has evoked passionate rejoinders 
from those educators who desire to maintain the exist- 
ing type of liberal education unchanged. On this issue 
American educationists are divided into warring 
camps, and, interestingly enough, the battle rages with 
especial bitterness in the field of the women’s colleges. 
For a generation or more the universities for men have 
been enriching their curricula with vocational courses 
other than the so-called ‘‘learned professions’’ of law, 
medicine, and theology; witness the development of 
schools of agriculture, pharmacy, engineering, archi- 
tecture, journalism, commerce, and business. But the 
eastern colleges for women, established with the en- 
   
-P-A-G-E-155
CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 145 
thusiastic purpose of demonstrating to a skeptical 
world ‘‘that John and Jane are precisely alike, espe- 
cially Jane!’’—these institutions, alarmed by the vigor 
and cogency of the attack upon their educational 
strongholds, have organized a powerful if not an 
aggressive defense. 
The Argument for the Historic Ideal of Culture.— 
The case for the defenders of the old ideal of liberal 
education cannot be lightly dismissed without an hon- 
est hearing. Its basic position is, of course, that where 
a subject is pursued with a view to applying the knowl- 
edge or skill it may afford to the work of earning a 
living, the subject fails to yield its richest intellectual 
and esthetic returns. Learning as preparation for a 
life career is self-interested learning; it is narrow in 
range and application; it does not liberalize the mind 
of the learner. His chief concern is to acquire only 
such knowledge as his vocation demands and to devote 
his intellectual and manual energies to the mastery 
of a specific technique. Such an education, declares 
this group, may produce skill in doing something but it 
lamentably fails to develop a person capable of being 
something. The all-round development of personality, 
revealed in the broadly enlightened and informed 
mind, the trained intellectual powers, the developed 
taste and appreciation of the liberally educated indi- 
vidual is sacrificed by the vocational group to the 
cramped, bread-and-butter aim of earning a livelihood. 
The self-interested character of the latter, inherent in 
its very nature, renders it a dangerous foe of liberal 
culture, the distinguishing mark of which is the disin- 
terested search for truth and beauty. 
The elements of truth in this position are obvious 
 
-P-A-G-E-156
  146 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
enough and entitle it to serious consideration. Despite 
this fact, the opponents of the historic ideal of culture 
have pushed its advocates so shrewdly that they have 
become fearful of the inroads of the enemy into their 
ranks. The distress signals flung out in recent writings 
bear witness to this alarm. Thus ex-President Taylor 
of Vassar appeals to the alumne of the college in fer- 
vent language: 
“Watch your heritage, college women! Watch the tendencies to 
reduce your colleges of liberal learning by a theory which would 
logically make our colleges for men into schools of business, pro- 
fessions, training for fatherhood, education in blacksmithing, or 
for bank clerks. Better housekeepers, wives, mothers, teachers, 
social workers, stenographers, saleswomen,—yes! yes! Our need 
is manifest. But better women, first of all, larger in grasp, wider 
of vision, fuller of resource for the soul in the conflicts of these 
latter days—that was the message, practically new that Vassar 
flashed on a questioning world.” * 
Even more agitated is the appeal of ex-President 
Thomas of Bryn Mawr: 
“A woman’s college is a place where we take those wonderful, 
tender, and innocent freshmen [sic!] with their inherited prejudices 
and ancestral emotions and mould them by four years of strenuous, 
intellectual discipline into glorious thinking, reasoning women fit 
to govern themselves and others. 
“But the curriculum of our women’s colleges is threatened by a 
terrible foe at the gates—a wolf in sheep’s clothing that can only 
be kept at bay by the most gallant kind of warfare. . . . So-called 
new fashioned, or modern, subjects are to be substituted for the old 
tried disciplines. Japanese geisha schools are springing up on all 
sides. Practical vocational courses are to be given. Latin and 
Greek are to go. Algebra and geometry are also to be dropped— 
only so much commercial arithmetic as we use in daily life (which

Theory and Practice,” in The Fiftieth Anniversary of the Opening of Vassar 
College, 1915, p. 31.

CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 147 
is practically none) is to be taught. History (except the very most 
modern kind) and all literature (except twentieth century literature) 
are to be scrapped. 
“Now is the time for us to fight for our lives, for our educational 
convictions and save if we can at least the girls of the east by 
firmly refusing to give up our present college curriculum. It is our 
highest duty as educated women to... pass on unimpaired to 
the girls of the next generation this precious intellectual heritage 
which has been so hardly won.” * 
An analysis of the arguments in behalf of culture 
as the end of education serves to make plain that the 
strength of its advocates lies more in their exposure 
of the weak points of their opponents’ position than in 
the demonstration of the positive merits of their own. 
Certain it is that Aristotle, the first apologist for this 
view, was profoundly right when he declared that 
‘fany occupation, art, or science, which makes the body 
or soul or mind of the freeman less fit for the practice 
or exercise of virtue, is vulgar; .. .’’? 
By ‘‘virtue,’’ of course, Aristotle meant that intel- 
lectual and moral excellence which the Greeks always 
associated with the word épern. It cannot be doubted 
that much of the unintelligent, menial work performed 
by the laboring classes in Greece fell under the ban 
pronounced upon it by Aristotle. It did tend to make 
‘‘the soul or mind of the freeman less fit’’ for the pur- 
suit of those intellectual, moral, and political activities 
which constituted for Aristotle, as for most cultivated 
minds, the essence of ‘‘the good life,’’ the life of ex- 
cellence. But when Aristotle goes further and stig- 
matizes ‘‘all paid employments’’ as vulgarizing he 
brings into clear light the crux of the whole matter.

  148 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
If it be true that all wage earning occupations tend 
to ‘‘absorb and degrade the mind”’ of the worker and, 
by inference, that all training for such vocations has a 
similar vulgarizing effect, the case for the adherents 
of a liberal education, in the historic sense, seems 
made and the advocates of vocational training have 
lost the day. No educator in his senses can favor any 
type of mental training which restricts the range of 
the students’ interests and knowledge, trains only a 
selected few of his mental powers, neglects the de- 
velopment of those tastes and appreciations that make 
possible ‘‘the worthy use of leisure,’? and absorbs 
the mind of the student in the technicalities of earn- 
ing a livelihood. 
But is this position sound? Is it true that the pro- 
fessional training of the clergyman, the doctor, the 
journalist, the teacher, or the architect is of such a 
nature as to degrade his mind to the mere interests of 
money-making? Is it not rather true that Aristotle 
and the modern protagonists of culture tend to make 
inherent in all wage-earning occupations a defect that 
charcterized only those demanding manual skill with- 
out thought? Even the most enthusiastic adherents of 
cultural education would hardly deny the liberalizing 
elements in the course of training for the so-called 
“learned professions.’’ Yet, even while admitting the 
possibility that professional and cultural training may 
not be wholly alien to each other, the advocates of 
liberal education take the ground that the very choice 
of a life-work and the selection of those studies which 
will best further that purpose at once introduce the 
limiting evils of specialization and absorption in ma- 
terial interests. So far as the latter charge is con-
-P-A-G-E-159
  
CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 149 
cerned it cannot be more satisfactorily met than by 
quoting the argument of Professor Dewey who has 
thought more deeply into the heart of this question 
than any other educator of his day: 
“Even if we insist that the interests connected with getting a 
living are only material and hence intrinsically lower than those 
connected with enjoyment of time released from labor, and even if it 
were admitted that there is something engrossing and insubordinate 
in material interests which leads them to strive to usurp the place 
belonging to the higher ideal interests, this would not—barring the 
fact of socially divided classes—lead to neglect of the kind of 
education which trains men for useful pursuits. It would rather 
lead to scrupulous care for them, so that men were trained to be 
efficient in them and yet to keep them in their place... . Only 
when a division of these interests coincides with a division of an 
inferior and a superior social class will preparation for useful 
work be looked down upon with contempt as an unworthy thing: @ 
fact which prepares one for the conclusion that the rigid identifica- 
tion of work with material interests and leisure with ideal interests 
is itself a social product.” * 
But what of the further charge of narrow special- 
ization as inseparable from training for useful work? 
It must be freely granted that specialized training 
may be so narrowly conceived and carried on that it 
fails to result in culture, in a liberalized mind. No one 
who has observed with an open spirit the courses in 
some, at least, of our specialized schools such as engi- 
neering, applied science, education, or domestic econ- 
“omy, can fail to be impressed with the fact that their 
field of study is too restricted and far too unrelated 
to the larger social background of community life. 
This is a real danger that confronts all specialized 
training and it should be frankly faced and acknowl- 
1 Democracy and Education, p. 294. Italics mine.
-P-A-G-E-160
  150 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
edged. But it is one thing to recognize the pitfalls into 
which preparation for life work may fall and it is 
quite another to maintain that these dangers are in- 
herent in that type of education. The fact that voca- 
tional training in the past has had too limited an out- 
look upon contemporary life, and has drawn in too 
niggardly a fashion upon the great reservoirs of 
knowledge and inspiration that form the social in- 
heritance of mankind should not in itself lead educated 
men and women to hold vocational training in low 
esteem. Rather the situation should serve as a chal- 
lenge to work out programs of education for a wide 
variety of skilled vocations which should be enriched 
by tributary streams from the whole field of knowl- 
edge. After thirty years of experience as an educa- 
tor, Dr. Felix Adler declares with conviction that it is 
a fundamental mistake to set culture over against 
preparation for life. Rather is it true that it is prepa- 
ration for life which is to give us culture. 
“We must redefine culture,” [he asserts,] “and we must get it 
out of our vocational training. It is all wrong to think of general 
eulture as consisting of familiarity with a set of subjects, outside 
of our own specialty and unrelated to it.... [We] must depart- 
mentalize all our higher education, building up the departments 
along the lines of the great vocations, and even running this di- 
vision down into the high school... . We must insist upon the 
concept that general culture—not special merely, but general—is 
to be won out of rightly specialized professional training.” * 
In our colleges and universities for women would 
it not be possible to map out courses in architecture, 
‘journalism, education, home economics, public health

nursing, and civil service, to mention only a few, which 
should be so vitally related to community problems and 
aims and so broadly conceived as to make generous use 
of the natural and social sciences, the arts, history, 
literature, as well as the technique that go to the mak- 
ing of our rich human heritage? What architect but 
needs to know much of the history of his art in its 
relation to the civilization of various peoples; to under- 
stand the exact and applied sciences that are the 
groundwork of building; to be inspired by the great 
artistic ideas and achievements of past ages; and to 
gain sympathetic insight into the peculiar genius, the 
strivings for ideal expression, of his own nation? Such 
a course could hardly, it would seem, fall under the 
ban of narrow specialization, since its main current of 
interest would be fed by inflowing streams from a 
broad and diversified area. 
The Case for Advocates of Vocational Education. — 
Like the protagonists of liberal culture, the advocates 
of a vocationalized higher education draw their chief 
strength from their criticisms of their opponents’ 
position. Their attacks on the current conception of 
liberal education are admirably designed to expose 
the weak places in this historic theory. Interestingly 
enough, the men who most effectively espouse the 
cause of liberalized vocational training,—such men 
as John Dewey, ex-President Eliot, Dr. Ernest Moore, 
Felix Adler, and Alexis Lange,—are themselves the 
finest products of the old liberal education. But their 
long experience as educators has convinced them of 
the necessity of a radical revision of the prevailing 
ideas of culture in the interests, not alone of social 
well-being, but of culture itself. 
   
-P-A-G-E-162
    152 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
The Social Waste Involved in Present Cultural Edu- 
cation.—These men, and others in agreement with 
them, point out that the present system of liberal 
education results in loss both to society and the in- 
dividual. On the social side the loss is summed up in 
the fact that every year thousands of young women 
are graduated with the bachelor’s degree who are 
quite unfit to undertake any form of skilled work and 
who, in too many instances, have never been inoculated 
with the idea that they are debtors to society for 
some form of useful service. Of 16,739 women grad- 
uates of eight eastern colleges and one university 
who responded to a questionnaire sent out in 1915 by 
the Association of Collegiate Alumnez, more than 30 
per cent. had never been gainfully employed. 
No doubt a proportion of this group of over 5,000 
young women performed some useful work in the 
home. But in some instances at ldast thig was prob- 
ably sporadic and unorganized; and in the case of 
those who did no household service we have clearly 
a body of college trained women living in a condition 
approaching social parasitism. It is of this-group,' 
highly privileged as regards educational opportunity 
and yet to a large extent socially unproductive, that 
Professor Lange is thinking when he writes; f 
“For women no less: than for men a higher education that pre- 
pares only for leisure and perhaps a purely decorative or parasitic 
life should be a thing of the past. . . . Women, perhaps more than / 
men need to be warted against making a college course a thing for 
individual subjective satisfactions.” ? 
The loss to society of the skilled services of the

-P-A-G-E-163
  CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 153 
thousands of women who are yearly graduated from 
American colleges and universities with little or no 
interest in socially useful work and no intention of 
fitting themselves for it can hardly be exaggerated. 
Nor do the advocates of cultural education meet this 
criticism when they point to the graduates of Vassar 
and Wellesley, of Smith and Bryn Mawr who have 
distinguished both themselves and their colleges by 
the high character of their social service. What so- 
ciety is coming to demand and will increasingly de- 
mand is that every young woman who has enjoyed the 
benefits of higher education shall make solid returns to 
society in the form of skilled or constructive work. Our 
higher institutions of learning are sending out into the 
world too many women deficient in that social culture 
which expresses itself in broad and intelligent social 
interest, developed social sympathy, and power to do 
something of socidl utility. 
But the loss to society does not end here. The ‘‘hu- 
man wealth represented by college women is very un- 
satisfactorily distributed if not actually wasted.’? A 
>very high proportion of the college women who take 
up gainful: employments after graduation enter the 
eld of teaching. This is made abundantly clear by 
he Censgis of College Women so frequently referred 
to. Of the 11,663 graduates of nine eastern institu- 
tions who had: been gainfully employed at any time 
"ga, Ay per cent. had been teachers!+ The reason for so 
large an influx of college women into teaching is ob- 
vious enough, although its justification is not so ap- 
parent. Teaching is, of course, the path of least re- 
sistance for those women who desire to utilize as 
1Op. cit., p. 560. 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  154 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
promptly as possible the information they have 
acquired in college as a means of gaining a livelihood; 
and until recently, not much professional training has 
been required of college graduates. Therefore eco- 
nomic pressure, together with lack of information 
about the skilled vocations open to women, is largely 
responsible for the disproportionate number of college 
women in the teaching profession. 
“It would be a courageous advocate of the old culture 
who would seek to maintain that all these intelligent 
young women enter the field of teaching from sheer 
love and fitness for the work. Far too many square 
pegs are seeking to accommodate themselves to round 
holes in this profession, as in others; and the loss to 
society is real and serious. For not only is it true 
that a considerable number of these young women 
could render a more valuable service to the commu- 
nity in another kind of work, enlisting more fully their 
peculiar aptitudes, but it is also true that the failure 
of higher educational institutions for women to de- 
velop initiative in a larger proportion of their grad- 
uates represents an irreparable social waste. Surely 
an intellectual quality of such signal advantage to 
society should not be left to chance or solely to the 
mercies of college clubs and class organizations. The 
atmosphere of academic aloofness from the concerns 
of every-day life which surrounds many of our higher 
institutions of learning is not calculated to encourage 
students to enter new fields of work or to apply knowl- 
edge to current social questions. An example of col- 
lege women’s failure in initiative is shown in the fact 
that they have never resolutely attacked the problems 
of family life and child-rearing in a scientific spirit. 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 155 
Yet here is a field of investigation that would seem 
to be peculiarly their own. Miss Julia Lathrop, chief 
of the Children’s Bureau in Washington, has called 
attention to this fact in more than one vigorous article. 
“Nowhere,” [she writes,] “is there any center for research and 
discovery, nowhere a center where choice minds are devoting their 
powers to the philosophy of the inevitable labors of the average 
household, to developing by original study improved care of the 
young who must be nurtured there, new expedients for enriching 
the lives of the adults who should be happy there. Nowhere patient 
research gives the authoritative sanction which would elevate into a 
national system, strong, free, elastic, the cult of the American 
family.” * 
It is pertinent to add that the very emphasis laid by 
Miss Lathrop’s own Alma Mater, and by other 
women’s colleges, on a purely academic culture, re- 
vealing no ‘‘taint’’ of practical utility, is one of the 
outstanding reasons for the lack of interest and initia- 
tive of college women in a field historically their own. 
The Loss to the Individual—wNo less serious than 
the social waste is the individual loss resulting from 
our present conception of liberal education. Young 
women, at the close of an expensive college course cov- 
ering four years, not infrequently wake with a start 
to the disturbing fact that they are quite unfitted to 
earn their living in any skilled vocation. More than 
once individual seniors of a liberal arts college have 
expressed to the writer their sense of dismay and dis- 
appointment when the realization dawned upon them 
that the college degree was not an Open Sesame to 
any profession except teaching, and not even to that 
in all localities. Only this year a student in a liberal 
1“The Highest Education for Women,” in Vassar ‘College Fiftieth Anni- 
versary Volume, p. 90.  
-P-A-G-E-166
    156 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
arts college for women wrote in an examination this 
bitter indictment of her own education: 
“The twentieth century student is cursed with all the cultural 
accumulation of historic times. Her education is likely to leave her 
burdened with the necessity of making her own choice of a career; 
and to that choice her college studies seem wholly irrelevant. At 
least, it is my case, that my work at school seems impertinent to 
my work after school. Education does not«discover the student.” 
The problem of this young woman and, indeed, of thou- 
sands of others, is an economic one: how to relieve their 
parents, saddled during their college years with a heavy 
financial burden, from all further responsibility for 
their support. It is these young graduates, having little 
aptitude and desire to teach, who flock to the college 
bureaus of employment in the hope of finding highly 
paid. positions immediately open to them. The re- 
ports of the Collegiate Vocational Bureaus published 
in the Journal of the Association of Collegiate Alumne 
not infrequently contain laments over this situation. 
Thus the Kansas City Bureau writes in 1918: 
“This office has been trying to get some enthusiasm for training 
among the women who come to it—training for some particular line, 
no matter what, just so it is training. We must stem the tide or 
we shall wake up and find the business world glutted with untrained 
college women . . . who have rushed in to take up the many op- 
portunities open to women for which so few of them are equipped. 
There is a dearth of good stenographers, good bookkeepers, good 
anything but there is an overwhelming supply of women who wish 
good pay.” 
And the Pittsburgh Bureau writes in 1918 in the 
same strain: 
“The need for special training beyond college education is being 
shown every day in the calls from employers, even in these war 
times, when the impression is abroad that any woman is in de-
-P-A-G-E-167
CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 157 
mand. . . . For women with technical equipment in scientifi¢ work, 
social work, or secretarial work, for example, there is never a 
dearth of positions; for women who have had no previous experi- 
ence, and who are interested in “anything” we have difficulty in 
finding a suitable opening, where their education can be utilized, 
and where such women would be satisfied with the salary and the 
future offered.” 
Surely this situation is far from satisfactory. Yet 
the colleges from which these young women have been 
graduated would almost certainly waive all respon- 
sibility for the conditions on the ground that their duty 
has been fulfilled when they have ‘‘exposed’’ their 
students for four years to the benign influences of 
liberal culture. After this ‘‘cultivation’’ has done its 
perfect work, let the young woman spend a year (or ° 
two or three years) more in fitting herself for pro- 
fessional work. But it is here that the shoe pinches. 
The woman of twenty-two + who needs to earn her liv- 
ing after college graduation can ill afford, and in some 
instances will simply not be able to afford, further ex- 
pensive preparation for gainful work. The necessity 
for earning a livelihood is urgent and immediate. 
Such young women take what they can get and join 
the ranks of unskilled women workers. After years 
of such work they may utilize their scanty savings in 
securing a belated professional training. A flood of 
light upon the numbers of college women who are pur- 
suing vocations other than teaching for which they 
have received no professional or technical training is 
shed by the Census of the A. C. A. Of the 471 grad- 
uates engaged in social work only 172, or 36.5 per cent., 
+The modal age of 15,912 college women at graduation was found to be 
22 years and less than 23. See Jour. of Assoc. of Coll. Alum., May, 1918,

had received training; of those in library work 55.3 
per cent.; in business 23.1 per cent.; in administra- 
tive posts in education only 28.8 per cent. (!); in gov- 
ernment service 39 per cent.; in art 58 per cent.; in 
religious work 33.3 per cent. In contrast with these 
figures the percentage of trained women in the his- 
toric ‘‘professional pursuits,’’ ie., law, medicine, 
theology, rose to 95.2. The total percentage of college 
women who had received professional or technical 
training after their college course was only 36.4.1 
What of the 1,411 young women (63.5 per cent. of the 
non-teaching group) who in 1915 were carrying on a 
vocation requiring skill and knowledge with no suit- 
able preparation for the same? In the face of these 
facts (which apply only to the eastern colleges) it is 
difficult to see how educational institutions for women 
can still maintain that they are performing their full 
duty toward their students. If nearly two-thirds of 
a body of more than 2,200 college women are perform- 
ing more or less unskilled work, in vocations outside of 
teaching, at whose door rests the responsibility? It 
would seem that the advocates of a vocationalized 
higher education might draw cogent arguments from 
these conditions. 
As we have seen, another way out of the difficulty 
for the woman graduate is to become a teacher and to 
obtain a dubious ‘‘experience’’ in a rural or small- 
town school—for city schools are no longer willing to 
accept untrained and inexperienced teachers. Un- 
questionably the low salaries paid women teachers in 
the past have been due in some measure to the large 
number of untrained college women who have flocked 
1 Op. cit., p. 571,
-P-A-G-E-169
  CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 159 
into the teaching profession. The Census of College 
Women shows that in 1915 the median salary of more 
than 3,000 college graduates in teaching was only $995; 
and 521 (or 17 per cent.) of these women were earning 
less than $700. It is hardly necessary to point out the 
marked inferiority of this wage to that of a carpen- 
ter, plumber, or mason, or even to the salary paid 
college women in other occupations for which they 
have been able to secure the requisite training. 
For example, the Census shows that in 1915 the 
median wage for social service work was $1,132, 
for literary work $1,216, and for government service 
$1,300. 
The intellectual loss which results to the individual 
from a rigid adherence to the old conception of liberal 
education is no less serious than the economic 
loss. Nine years ago the President emeritus of 
Harvard vigorously expressed his convictions on this 
matter: ‘ 
“Tt is high time that our teachers and leaders of the people 
understood that every civilized human being gets the larger part 
of his life-training in the occupation thru which he earns his liveli- 
hood, and that his schooling in youth should invariably be directed 
to prepare him in the best way for the best permanent occupation 
of which he is capable. In other words the motive of the life- 
career should be brought into play as early and fully as possible. 
. .. We ought not to be surprised that the schools which avail 
themselves of this strong motive get the best work from their 
pupils and therefore do the best work for the community. All of 
us adults do our best work in the world under the impulsion of 
the life-career motive. ... There is nothing low or mean about 
these motives, and they lead on the people who are swayed by 
them to greater serviceableness and greater happiness—to greater 
serviceableness, because the power and scope of individual produc- 
tiveness are thereby increased—to greater happiness, because achieve-

  160 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
ment will become more frequent and more considerable, and to old 
and young alike happiness in work comes thru achievement.” * 
At this point many college teachers will admit that 
the heart of a serious educational difficulty is laid 
bare. What instructor in undergraduate courses has 
not struggled, with a sense of futility, against the blank 
indifference of a considerable proportion of his class— 
an indifference which develops in him the deadening 
conviction that try as he will, he has not succeeded in 
relating his subject to the life interests and purposes 
of his students. The loss of intellectual energy in edu- 
cation through the failure to connect studies with the 
vital interests and purposeful activities of the indi- 
vidual can hardly be measured. An appreciation 
of this loss leads a contemporary writer bitterly to 
attack American college education. He points out 
that the progress of civilization in government, in re- 
ligion, and in industry has been marked by a movement 
‘from the primitive principle of external force toward 
the use of the self-generated dynamism within the in- 
dividual.’’? Nature has provided certain powerful mo- 
tive forces within us which are not ‘‘set off by logical 
reason, argument, inducement, nor by any form of 
external compulsion.’’ But once a goal is set by an 
individual for himself ‘‘it gathers force from the reser- 
voirs of associated complexes—those, for example, of 
home-building, jealousy of competitors, personal 
adornment, protection of the object of affection. With 
these dynamic energies united in pursuit of one goal, 
obstructions are forced aside resistlessly, the nerve 
energy rises into higher and hitherto undeveloped

centers—fluency of language, poesy, idealization, al- 
truism, chivalry, philosophizing, logical reasoning. 
The subject becomes supersensitively teachable. .. . 
This principle of dynamic energy exposes the folly and 
futility of attempting to prescribe the processes of 
education, and the greater folly of attempting to con- 
struct, through schooling, artificial mechanisms to take 
its place... .”’ 
This is a powerful criticism and its special applica- 
tion to the college is left in no doubt. 
“The clogging point in our educational log-jam to-day is without 
doubt the college. Here is the embattled stronghold of tradition. 
Because the college is the topmost part of the educational system 
its attitude commands the traditional respect of the people... . 
The current of reform in education cannot run with necessary 
force until the log-jam in the college gives way. What is needed 
is the courage of some first-grade college to break with tradition 
and set the logs rolling. Here is opportunity for the Great Ad- 
venture. Which one of our colleges has the vision to see it?” * 
Which eastern college of liberal arts indeed? Ata 
time when thoughtful critics are attacking a type of 
education demonstrably wasteful, the heads of these 
colleges, as we have seen, are actively concerned in 
preserving from every blemish of modernism the 
classic ideal of culture. They fail to see that only a 
limited number, even of college women, are capable of 
attaining culture along the traditional lines of the col- 
lege course; whereas the ideal of democracy is fully 
realized only when a liberal education is put within the 
reach of every individual to the extent of his ability. 
If once our higher institutions for women could be 
induced to abandon the notion that culture can be

  162 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
attained by only one path—the path of the present 
traditional curriculum—and could be led to see that 
divers minds of divers talents might become truly lib- 
eralized if only studies, methods, and goals were 
adapted to their natural gifts and life purposes, we 
should see a revitalizing of the higher education of 
women in America which would warm the heart and 
cheer the spirit of many a disheartened educator. 
No doubt one of the obstacles to such reform lies in 
the rooted notion of college women themselves that 
vocational courses involve nothing but manual train- 
ing. This conception of vocational education is clearly 
set forth by a Wellesley alumna in a recent article in 
the college Quarterly: 
“Why is it not possible for colleges to give liberal courses and 
vocational work, too? Simply because it is not possible to serve two 
masters—to combine manual training and mental development in 
the four short years of a college course. The college must be the 
home of intellectual and spiritual culture, the hotbed of ideas; it 
must not swerve from its purpose of educating the thinking powers. 
Practice in mechanical arts, experience in work that will lead to 
prompt employment, is undoubtedly excellent, but it cannot be 
joined with liberal culture, in institutions that are devoted to young 
women between eighteen and twenty-two years of age.” * 
Such a statement as the above makes one wish for a 
pen dipped in persuasive eloquence that one might 
iterate and reiterate the fact that no educator of sound 
mind desires to lose a jot or tittle of the cultural values 
held in such high esteem by college women. Rather 
does he desire to enhance them and ensure them, so 
far as may be, to all students (not alone the chosen 
few who achieve them) by linking higher education to

CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 163 
those motive forces of the human mind which, outside 
of our schools and colleges, play the controlling réle 
in high achievement. It is not the mere training of 
eye and hand that can properly be called vocational 
education. Rather is it a development of native tastes 
and aptitudes, expressed in the ‘‘life-career motive,’’ 
by means of rich and varied courses, involving free, 
self-expressive methods of thought and activity—such 
a development as will bear fruit in some degree of 
liberal culture for every woman, be her cardinal in- 
terest the teaching of Greek literature, industrial 
chemistry, or trained nursing. 
Vocational Guidance and Training in Colleges.—The 
present situation in the higher educational institu- 
tions for women is not entirely hopeless. For nearly 
a decade these colleges and universities have been 
wrestling with the problem of vocational guidance 
of students without sacrificing their ideals of lib- 
eral culture. Several years ago Professor Elizabeth 
Kemper Adams declared that vocational guidance was 
a matter much in the public mind which the colleges 
were bound to face. She pointed out that college stu- 
dents ‘‘with the best intentions (are) pitifully igno- 
rant and short-sighted and confiding in the planning of 
their college work.’’ Therefore some form of voca- 
tional advising seemed justified on two grounds. 
“‘First, on the practical ground, it means simply doing 
expertly and with full information at our disposal 
what we are now doing haltingly and with half-knowl- 
edge. Second, on the educational ground, it means 
substituting some rational principle of selection of 
courses for the haphazard and trivial motives for 
selection now influencing a large number of college 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  164 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
students.’’ Professor Adams gave it as her opinion 
that the present college curriculum without the addi- 
tion of a single new course ‘‘furnishes subject-matter 
offering a direct approach to later professional work.’’ 
If type courses, preliminary to different occupations 
now open to college women, were organized by wise 
instructors these courses might prepare directly for 
vocations ‘‘with no sacrifice of the cultural character 
of the college course.’’ 
' This surely is wise, even if somewhat cautious ad- 
vice. However, it does not appear that any of the 
women’s colleges has followed Professor Adams’ sug- 
gestion and prepared ‘‘type courses’’ leading to 
selected occupations. Not only is this true, but a study 
of the recent catalogues of these institutions reveals 
few studies (except, perhaps laboratory courses in 
chemistry, physics, and biology) which have a direct 
vocational bearing. Wellesley, however, has organized 
two departments of a distinctly vocational character 
which grant certificates at the completion of the course. 
One is the department of hygiene offering two years’ 
work designed to train teachers of the subject; the 
second is the department of music which offers a four 
years’ course of combined theoretical and practical 
work. Both Wellesley and Smith offer courses in 
education, but these are not directly preparatory to 
the teaching profession except in the case of Wellesley’s 
graduate courses in secondary and kindergarten edu- 
cation. Most of the women’s colleges furnish studies 
in applied sociology, such as the Vassar course in 
Charities and Corrections and the Wellesley course 
in Social Economics, which includes a study of de- 
pendents, delinquents, housing, sanitation, recreation,
-P-A-G-E-175
  CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 165 
and measures of reform. Few, indeed, of the eastern 
colleges for women afford opportunities for study of 
home economics. Only Wheaton, the youngest, and 
Elmira, the oldest of these institutions, have organized 
courses in this field. 
But if women’s colleges have done little to provide 
vocational courses for their regular students they 
have, under the stimulus of the world-war just ended, 
given promising evidences of their ability to organize 
such courses if they would. Relegated to the period 
of the summer session, new courses of training for 
definite forms of skilled work were introduced at Vas- 
sar, Wellesley, Smith, Mt. Holyoke, and Bryn Mawr. 
Vassar’s three months’ pre-nursing course, given to 
430 college graduates in the summer of 1918, enabled 
these young women to finish the nurses’ training 
course, in certain codperating hospitals of excellent 
standing, in two years instead of three. An intensive 
course it was, demanding hard work and severe appli- 
cation on the part of the students. No one who visited 
this summer school and went, as did the writer, from 
class to class, could fail to observe the enthusiastic 
interest, the whole-souled willingness to work of these 
young women; nor could he fail to contrast it with the 
polite lethargy of many students in the ‘‘cultural’’ 
courses of liberal arts colleges. 
But Vassar was not alone in the praiseworthy at- 
tempts to meet the need of the nation for trained 
women during the war. During the summer of 1918 
Smith College offered a course of eight months’ train- 
ing for psychiatric aids. The purpose of the course 
was declared to be the preparation of ‘‘social workers 
to assist in the rehabilitation, individual and social, 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
    166 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
of soldiers suffering from nervous and mental dis- 
eases, including war neurosis and so-called shell- 
shock.’’ Clearly the directors of the course did not 
regard it as merely a war emergency training for they 
went on to state that ‘‘these workers would also be of 
permanent value in civil neuropsychiatric work as 
assistants to hospitals, courts, schools, out-patient de- 
partments, and social agencies.’’ After two months 
of theoretical instruction at Smith College there fol- 
lowed six months of practice work in such well-known 
institutions as the Boston Psychopathic Hospital, the 
New York Neurological Institute, the Phipp’s Clinic 
of Baltimore, and other centers affording ‘‘opportuni- 
ties for social work with psychiatric cases under di- 
rection of trained social workers.’’ Those of the sixty- 
three enrolled students who successfully completed the 
course were granted a certificate by a special commit- 
tee of the National Committee of Mental Hygiene 
under whose auspices the course was given. 
Summer courses of a distinctly vocational character 
were likewise established at Mt. Holyoke and Welles- 
ley. The former offered a training course for in- 
dustrial health specialists under the capable direction 
of Dr. Kristine Mann, health supervisor of the 
Women’s Branch of the Industrial Service of the Ord- 
nance Department. At the same time Wellesley took 
up the useful and timely work of training the manag- 
ing heads of women’s farm units. Bryn Mawr Col- 
lege also inaugurated, during the summer of 1918, an 
eight months’ course of training for college graduates 
in the field of industrial supervision. This course 
was given in the Carola Woerishoffer School of Social 
Economy and Social Research, and included prepara-
-P-A-G-E-177
  CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 167 
tion for the following lines of work: employment man- 
agers, service or welfare superintendents, factory in- 
spectors, investigators of industrial problems affect- 
ing women, industrial secretaries and industrial group 
leaders. The training involved academic courses at 
Bryn Mawr, followed by field work in manufacturing 
establishments in Philadelphia and New England. 
It would be unwarranted optimism to hold that these 
vocational courses offered in eastern colleges for 
women, confessedly the strongholds of the historic 
ideal of liberal education, are a hopeful sign of future 
progress towards a truer conception of culture, one 
better adapted to the ideal purposes of an industrial 
democracy. Unhappily this encouraging beginning in 
women’s colleges has been continued, since the signing 
of the armistice, in only two institutions. Smith Col- 
lege has organized a Training School for Social Work 
including courses in psychiatric and medical social 
work, community service and child welfare. Two 
months of lectures at the college during the summer are 
followed by eleven months of practical training in the 
field. Likewise Bryn Mawr has continued to offer 
courses in industrial management and research in its 
graduate school. Twenty-nine of the graduates of 
this course have obtained excellent positions as em- 
ployment managers or in the research departments of 
firms carrying on industrial councils. But Mt. Holyoke 
has definitely abandoned the work of training indus- 
trial health specialists; and Wellesley states that its 
course for training managing heads of women’s farm 
units ‘‘existed as a war measure for one year only.’’ 
If our American civilization is crude and ma- 
terialistic, if the inner significance of human life  
-P-A-G-E-178
168 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
escapes us in our feverish effort to organize the me- 
chanics of production, wherein does the remedy lie 
if not in a type of education which seeks ‘‘to use the 
vital, unspiritualized agencies of to-day as means of 
effecting the perception of a human meaning yet to 
be realized ... ?’’ Ifa spiritualized and more beau- 
tiful civilization is to be developed from our present 
industrialized culture, must we not look to our college 
men and women in large measure to point the way? 
“To perpetuate in the name of culture the tradition of 
aloofness from realistic science and compelling in- 
dustry is to give them free course in their most un- 
enlightened form.’’+ 
The possibilities of advanced vocational training 
for college women are, it is hardly necessary to say, 
far more promising in the state universities and west- 
ern colleges for women than in the more conservative 
East. Not only did the former institutions offer in 
1917-18 valuable war emergency courses, for which 
they granted academic credit, but their general policy 
seems to be more favorable to the theory that genuine 
culture may be attained through vocational training 
than is the policy of their sister colleges in the East. 
A study of the catalogues of the great western uni- 
versities of California, Iowa, Michigan, and Wiscon- 
sin—to mention only a few—shows how far these insti- 
tutions have gone in preparing their students for a 
life-work at the same time that they have sought to 
develop liberalized minds. California’s Schools and 
Colleges of Education, Architecture, Jurisprudence, 
Medicine, Commerce, Agriculture, and Chemistry are

all open to women and grant degrees on the completion 
of courses covering from four to six or seven years. 
Nearly two years ago this university tried the experi- 
ment of organizing a nurses’ course of five years, com- 
bining study in the College of Letters and Science 
with practical work in the Nurses’ Training School of 
the university. This course leads to a B.S. degree 
and a state nurse’s certificate. Moreover California 
has recently (1918) established a professional course 
in public health leading to the degree of Graduate in 
Public Health. 
In like manner the state university of Iowa offers 
its women courses in the School of Commerce and in 
the Colleges of Education, Law, Medicine, Dentistry, 
and Pharmacy. Michigan affords similar opportuni- 
ties, together with courses in architecture, leading to 
the B.S. degree and in nursing leading to a nurses’ 
certificate at the completion of a three years’ course. 
The University of Wisconsin, in addition to its College 
of Agriculture and its Schools of Medicine, Law, and 
Music, has organized various departments in the Col- 
lege of Letters and Science which are definitely voca- 
tional in character. These are the departments of 
Chemistry (for training industrial, agricultural, 
physiological, and food chemists), Commerce, Journal- 
ism, Pharmacy, Library Methods, and Education. 
Also there is a Physical Education department for 
training teachers. All these courses are organized 
on a four-year undergraduate basis and lead to the 
bachelor’s degree in science or arts. At the University 
of Wisconsin, then, renowned for its intelligent 
attempts to meet the educational needs of the people of 
the state, it is possible for young women in under-
-P-A-G-E-180
  170 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
graduate work happily to combine professional train- 
ing with those studies which broaden the outlook on 
life, develop the power of thought and quicken the 
appreciation of beauty and truth. The same holds 
true of Mills College, California, which has coura- 
geously broken with tradition and offers courses in 
education, home economics, household science and 
art, library science, physical education designed to 
train teachers, and pre-medical and pre-nursing 
courses. 
Clearly it is the western colleges and universities 
admitting women which have gone farthest along 
the road of a much-needed educational reform. Not 
only have the state universities accomplished meas- 
urable results in bridging the gulf between liberal and 
vocational education but such women’s colleges as 
Milwaukee-Downer and Mills College show a com- 
mendable desire to adapt their educational offerings 
to the needs and special aptitudes of their stu- 
dents. Both colleges offer courses of a vocational 
character in art, home economics, hygiene and phys- 
ical education, and music; and in addition Mills Col- 
lege affords training in library methods, education, 
and nursing. 
Many of the leaders of women’s higher education 
who have taken a firm stand against the introduction 
of vocational studies into the classic atmosphere of 
liberal arts colleges have nevertheless admitted that 
some steps must be taken to put college women in 
touch with a new world of vocational opportunities. 
It is noteworthy, however, that the first advance in 
this direction was made by the Women’s Educational 
and Industrial Union of Boston when, im 1910, it
-P-A-G-E-181
  
CULTURAL VS. VOCATIONAL EDUCATION 171 
established an appointment bureau to aid college 
women in securing skilled employment other than 
teaching. In New York City the local alumne associa- 
tions, representing nine colleges or universities ad- 
mitting women, established the Intercollegiate Bureau 
of Occupations in 1911.1. This bureau, like the Boston 
organization, has done a valuable work in placing col- 
lege women and conducting investigations of existing 
and new vocational opportunities for trained women. 
Similar bureaus have been established in Philadelphia, 
Chicago, Pittsburgh, Omaha, San Francisco, and, in- 
deed, in most of the large cities of the country. The 
colleges themselves, however, have been content to 
maintain employment bureaus to assist their students 
in securing positions after graduation. These col- 
lege bureaus seek also to keep in touch with the work 
of the intercollegiate bureaus of the cities. Several 
eastern colleges go a step farther and employ every 
year a lecturer, well informed concerning the callings 
open to women, to hold a vocational conference of a 
few days’ duration. During this period the vocational 
adviser not only gives the upper class students a sur- 
vey of the field of women’s gainful occupations but 
also discusses with interested individuals the training 
requisite to prepare for a specific vocation and the 
outlook for advancement and growth in that type of 
skilled work. 
This is good as far as it goes; but it has been the 
primary purpose of this chapter to point out the real 
evils which result from a divorce of liberal and voca- 
tional training,—the unsocial and often purely acad- 
emic character of the one and the too specialized char-

acter of the other. The utilization of the dynamic 
force of interest in a chosen life-work to lead the stu- 
dent out into the fertile and varied fields of human 
culture is the outstanding educational problem of this 
industrial age. It is idle to proclaim that the problem 
has been solved save in individual instances. Neither 
the college of liberal arts nor the vocational college has 
yet convincingly shown the way by which cultural edu- 
cation may be infused with social purpose and effi- 
ciency and vocational education may be so enlarged in 
scope and significance as to become truly liberalizing 
to the mind.

  CHAPTER VI 
THE VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING 
GIRLS 
The Influx of Girls into Industry.—‘‘ When a phar- 
macist compounds a prescription he knows what ef- 
fect the various elements have on each other. When 
a manufacturer starts a piece of raw material on the 
road toward a finished product, he can account for 
the smallest change, the minutest process. But when 
a child starts on the bleak road which leads from one 
deadening occupation to another, who can chart his 
path or gauge the forces that mold and shape his 
future life.’’+ 
Several years ago it was estimated that the children 
in the United States between 14 and 16 years who 
start ‘‘on the bleak road which leads from one 
deadening occupation to another’? numbered more 
than 6,000,000. And the overwhelming majority of 
this child army had received no vocational training 
other than the manual or industrial arts courses of 
certain of the public schools. The steady growth in 
numbers of children entering industrial pursuits is 
shown by recent figures for New York City. In 1917, 
39,000 children under 16 took out working papers, 
whereas in 1918 the number had swelled to 50,700; an

increase of 30 per cent. No doubt a part of this large 
increase was due to the fact that the nation was at 
war; but this accounts only in part for the situation. 
As early as 1909 Miss Florence Marshall, then direc- 
tor of the Boston Trade School for Girls, stated that 
“in some of our cities 77 out of every 100 girls (16 to 
20) are working for pay outside the home’’ and 
thousands are working in factories in unskilled in- 
dustries.? 
A menacing factor in the situation created by the 
stream of girls into paid employments is the large 
percentage who leave the schools before completing 
the eighth year of the elementary course. The Report 
of the Commissioner of Education for 1917 shows 
that of the 18,375,225 children of both sexes enrolled 
in elementary schools throughout the country 68.48 
per cent. were in the first four grades and only 6.36 per 
cent. were enrolled in the eighth grade.* It has been 
estimated that one-half of the children who take 
out working papers have not completed the fifth 
year of school. This estimate is probably too high, 
although it receives some support from a recent 
study made in the stockyards district of Chicago, 
where it was found that of 1,222 girls in three elemen- 
tary schools only 26.2 per cent. were retained to the 
eighth grade. A further study of 300 of the girls who 
“took out their working papers’’ before completing 
the elementary course revealed that 65 per cent. were 
below the seventh grade.* Miss Van Kleeck’s study

of 7,854 working girls in New York evening schools 
was more favorable, showing that 16 per cent. left 
school before reaching the seventh grade and nearly 
32 per cent. withdrew before reaching the eighth 
grade. 
The causes of this high school mortality have fre- 
quently been discussed. Unquestionably the indiffer- 
ence of parents, especially the foreign born, to the edu- 
cation of girls beyond the compulsory age, the pres- 
sure of economic necessity, dislike of school, and the 
desire of girls to earn money all enter as factors. 
A vocational survey conducted in Minneapolis in 1915 
showed that some of the more frequent reasons for 
leaving school were as follows: 
Til health—5.7 per cent. 
“Had to go to work,”—35.5 per cent. 
Child’s desire to earn—8.2 per cent. 
Dislike for school or lack of interest in it—29.5 per cent. 
Belief that further schooling was not worth while—14.2 per 
cent. : 
From these alleged reasons it will be seen that, 
whereas economic necessity was responsible for 35.3 
per cent. of the school mortality, dislike of school or 
failure to appreciate its value was responsible for 43.7 
per cent. Miss Susan Kingsbury’s study in Massa- 
chusetts revealed that only 24 per cent. of the children 
of the state left school because of real financial pres- 
sure; and Miss Woolley’s investigation of 650 families 
in Cincinnati showed only 27 per cent. which needed 
the children’s earnings. Of 300 girls in the Chicago 
stockyards district who had left school before com- 
pleting the elementary course, only twelve went un- 
willingly ; the remaining 288 ‘‘had a more or less pro-

nounced dislike of school, as shown by their trivial 
reasons for leaving. .. .’’? : 
It appears probable, then, that the primary reason 
why our girls are leaving school for industry is not 
economic pressure but the failure of the school to en- 
list their interest and to approve itself as worth while. 
The effects of so large an influx of uneducated and 
untrained girls into industrial pursuits are obviously 
bad both for the girl and for industry. The large 
labor turnover in factories and stores is the source 
of enormous annual loss to employers and has a de- 
plorable effect upon the workers themselves in de- 
veloping the habit of drifting from place to place with 
a progressive loss of industrial capacity and interest 
in work. What growth in skill and intelligence can 
be expected of girls with employment histories like 
the following, which is drawn from records kept in Mil- 
waukee?

It seems reasonably certain that such occupational 
shifting, with its attendant loss to the girl and to 
industry, can be largely prevented by the establish- 
ment of trade or continuation schools. In 1915 the 
public school authorities in Boston collected some

significant figures bearing on this question. It was 
found that, before continuation schools were estab- 
lished in that city, children who left the elementary 
schools to go to work changed their places of employ- 
ment on an average of three or four times a year. Dur- 
ing the first year after continuation schools were 
opened, only about 15 per cent. of 2,300 children in at- 
tendance on these schools changed their occupations.* 
Development of Girls’ Trade and Continuation 
Schools.—Despite the serious problem created by the 
entrance of large numbers of untrained girls into in- 
dustry, public sentiment in favor of vocational educa- 
tion has been slow in developing. Almost nothing was 
done to train women for wage-earning until the Wom- 
en’s Educational and Industrial Union was organized 
in 1877. Girls’ trade and continuation schools are still 
in their infancy, for most of them have been estab- 
lished since the opening of the twentieth century. The 
pioneer in this field was the Manhattan Trade School 
opened in 1902. Two years later a Girls’ Trade School 
was established in Boston, which was followed by the 
organization of similar schools in Milwaukee, Chicago, 
Worcester, New Orleans, Philadelphia, and other 
cities. From the first, girls were discriminated against 
in favor of boys in the establishment of industrial 
schools. In 1910 the Report of the Commissioner of 
Education showed that, of approximately 193 trade 
schools throughout the country, only about 26 were 
established for girls.2 Most of the schools were lo- 
cated in the manufacturing states of the northeast. 
In recent years continuation schools or classes, for

girls as well as boys, have been organized in con- 
nection with many city school systems, notably in New 
York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston. Yet it can 
hardly be claimed that more than a small beginning 
has been made in the organization of systematic voca- 
tional education for girls and women. This is made 
evident by the third report of the Federal Board for 
Vocational Education (Vol. I: 220, Table 18).

To these numbers should be added 1,495 girl enrolled 
in the Manhattan Trade School. 
Present Tendencies in Vocational Education.—A few 
significant tendencies in the general movement for 
vocational education deserve brief consideration. One 
of these trends is toward the organization of state 
systems of vocational training. In 1915-16 there were 
eight such systems in the states of Maine, Massachu- 
setts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Indiana, 
Wisconsin, and New Mexico. As early as 1914-15 
Massachusetts boasted 77 state-aided vocational 
schools in 39 cities; while Pennsylvania had organized 
continuation schools in 98 districts of the state. 
Closely allied to this centralizing movement is that 
in the direction of granting Federal aid and encourage- 
ment to education in trades and industries. By the 
terms of the Smith-Hughes Act, enacted in 1917, a 
Federal Board for Vocational Education was created, 
among whose most important duties it is to codperate 
+, Rep. of the Com, of Hd., 1915-16, Vol. I, Ch. IX.

with the states in the promotion of vocational train- 
ing in'‘agriculture, home economics, trades, and in- 
dustries. This codperation takes the form of (1) pre- 
paring reports and investigations to assist the states 
in the establishment of state systems of vocational 
schools, and (2) allotting Federal funds to those states 
which comply with the conditions of the act, on the 
basis of population. The appropriations of the Gov- 
ernment. for trade and industrial education provide 
(1) for the payment of salaries of teachers of trade 
and industrial subjects; (2) for the training of teach- 
ers in those subjects. The initial appropriation for 
salaries is $500,000, rising to $3,000,000 in 1926, this 
amount to be annually appropriated thereafter. The 
appropriation for training teachers rises from $500,- 
000 in the first year to $1,000,000 at the end of the 
third year, when this amount becomes an annual ap- 
propriation. 
Up to January 1, 1918, 48 states\had accepted the 
Smith-Hughes Act and had submitted plans which 
were approved by the Federal Board. As a result 
federally aided courses in trade and industrial sub- 
jects have been set up in 32 states and teacher train- 
ing courses have been organized in 46 states. The 
record of the states in this work is characterized by 
the Commissioner of Education as ‘‘impressive.’’ For 
‘example, Massachusetts is offering federally ap- 
proved instruction in trade and industrial subjects 
in 36 schools, New York in 40, Pennsylvania in 131, 
California in 14, and Indiana in 21,—and this in an 
initial period of only ten months.? 
A third tendency in the general movement for voca-

tional education, and one already becoming fairly well 
organized and effective, is that toward vocational 
guidance of girls and boys. This movement was in- 
augurated by Professor Frank Parsons in the open- 
ing years of the twentieth century. At the Civic 
Service House in Boston, which was organized in 1901 
by Meyer Bloomfield, Mr. Parsons began his work of 
giving vocational counsel to young people. Largely 
owing to his faith and enthusiasm, the Boston Voca- 
tion Bureau was opened in the spring of 1908 and the 
work of giving intelligent vocational guidance to girls 
and boys about to enter the industrial market was 
greatly extended. From these beginnings the voca- 
tional guidance movement has spread from coast to 
coast and is assuming nation-wide importance. The 
useful work of the Boston Vocation Bureau led to 
the establishment of a Vocational Guidance Depart- 
ment in the Boston public schools. Since then some 
form of vocational counselling, although not always 
earried on by a central bureau, has been organized in 
most of the larger cities throughout the country. Even 
the universities, here and there, are conducting courses 
in vocational guidance. 
The vocational guidance movement had not pro- 
ceeded very far when it became evident to its leaders 
that intelligent counselling required, not only a knowl- 
edge of the aptitudes and tastes of the child seeking 
guidance, but also a definite working knowledge of 
the industrial openings in different communities, with 
a view to determining whether these openings held 
out chances for personal growth in skill and intel- 
ligence as well as for economic advancement. The 
perception of this need for more accurate understand-

ing of the working conditions children are forced to 
meet has resulted in recent years in a number of voca- 
tional surveys of which the Portland, Minneapolis, 
Richmond, and Cleveland Surveys are among the best 
known. The information which such a survey should 
secure has been classified by Dr. Richards, Director of 
Cooper Union, under the following main heads: * 
ly ecnanie data 
2. Physical and hygienic conditions 
3. Influence of the occupation on the character and growth of 
the workers 
4, Opportunities for beginners 
5. The relation. of the occupation to school training 
A study of this outline in full will show that the 
questions taken up are fairly searching and compre- 
hensive and embody the experience of nearly twenty 
years in grappling with the problem of the vocational 
training of youth. 
Problems in the Vocational Education of Girls.— 
The serious student in the field of vocational educa- 
tion for girls cannot go very far without being con- 
fronted by difficulties. One of the most obstinate of 
these may be embodied in the question: Is it practic- 
able to give vocational training for all industries? 
In any attempt to answer this question a distinction 
must. be made at the outset between the more mature 
girls, sixteen years of age and over, and the girls be- 
tween fourteen and sixteen who have left school to 
go to work at the earliest moment permitted by the 
law. Obviously the older girls, who have had the 
benefits of general and vocational education for a 
longer period, are far more useful to employers than 
| +See Brewer, The Vocational Guidance Movement, pp. 180-82.
-P-A-G-E-193
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 183 
the more immature and ignorant girls whom managers 
characterize as ‘‘childish,’’ ‘‘frivolous,’’ and full of 
“‘kinks.’? Child labor laws of many manufactur- 
ing states forbid children under sixteen to operate 
dangerous machinery. These conditions serve to 
keep the younger girls out of skilled occupations, 
such as power-machine operating, which demand some 
degree of maturity and education beyond the ele- 
mentary grades, and hence are closed to girls between 
fourteen and sixteen. In consequence the situation 
which Miss Davis found in Chicago could be duplicated 
in most industrial centers throughout the country: 
“Tt has been found that there are very few positions which offer 
even a little training to children under sixteen years; that usually 
the only skill required in any work is speed; that many employers 
do not want children under sixteen years of age because the law 
permits them to work only eight hours a day and because they are 
so small and unreliable that it is not worth while to bother with 
them; .°. .”* 
Clearly, then, decided advantages accrue to the 
girl who enters a wage-earning career after sixteen. 
To her are open such skilled occupations as office 
work, millinery, dressmaking, salesmanship, and 
power-machine operating in the clothing trades. In 
these employments there is opportunity for growth in 
manual skill and intelligence; therefore the problem 
of vocational training for such pursuits is relatively 
simple. Most of the trade and continuation schools 
for girls, as well as the practical arts high schools, 
offer courses which fit the student to enter some, at 
least, of these occupations. In most localities girls

who wish to become telephone operators must be at 
least seventeen years of age. Frequently they are also 
required to have had some high school training. In 
Boston, for example, there were in 1912 only 13 per 
cent. of the girls in telephone service who had 
not studied in high schools for varying periods of 
time. 
What is greatly needed at the present time is a 
series of investigations into the educational content 
of the various skilled occupations which are open to 
girls sixteen years of age or over, as well as those 
to which they may soon be admitted. Where such 
educational content exists it may be made the point of 
departure for thoughtfully planned courses in both 
the theory and the practice of the trade. Unfortu- 
nately few investigations have been undertaken that. 
approach in thoroughness and scope that made by Miss 
Cleo Murtland and Dr. C. A. Prosser in the dress and 
waist industry. This study was undertaken because 
of ‘‘a growing conviction on the part of those actively 
engaged in the promotion of industrial education in 
New York City that the body of the workers in the 
garment trades, are, under present conditions, at 
least, to be reached and trained through the use of 
part time schools.’ * 
The general plan of the investigation included (1) 
a study of the opportunities in that industry for self- 
development and earning power; (2) the working out 
of a scheme of education that would meet both the 
demands of the workers for self-development and the 
demands of the industry for skilled workers; and (3)

-P-A-G-E-195
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 185 
the elaboration of a plan for part-time schools that 
would enlist the support of employers and workers on 
the one hand and of the public on the other. At the 
outset the investigators saw clearly that no satis- 
factory educational scheme could be formulated which 
was not based on a careful analysis of the various 
operations included in the dress and waist industry, 
the qualities demanded of the workers, and the knowl- 
edge required—general as well as technical. The Re- 
port furnished such an analysis, together with a de- 
tailed account of the methods by which the girl enters 
the industry, the demand for workers, wages paid, 
length of working year, and opportunities for promo- 
tion. Such facts Leake characterizes as ‘‘standard in- 
formation,’’ lacking which ‘‘many of our attempts at 
industrial education have been initiated almost in the 
dark, and have achieved some measure of success 
owing to the fact that any kind of education is better 
than none.’’ 
The Problem of the Gir: in Unskilled Occupations.— 
Far more baffling, however, than the educational prob- 
lem presented by the relatively mature girls sixteen 
years and over is that created by the thousands of 
young girls between fourteen and sixteen flocking into 
the unskilled industries—occupations in which there 
is a minimum of opportunity for mental development 
and a maximum demand for rapid, automatic opera- 
tions. A recent study of 2,366 Cincinnati children who 
had taken out working papers revealed that the oc- 
cupations the girls were entering were those offered by 
shoe, paper box, and candy factories, department 
stores, and tailoring and sewing trades. Of the educa- 
tive value of this work Miss Woolley says: 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  186 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
“Very little of the work represented has any value as trade edu- 
eation. Hach child in a shoe factory performs from one to three 
of the 150 or more operations necessary in making a shoe. They 
lace shoes, ink edges, or wet soles. The girls in tailor shops pull 
bastings, or baste one kind of seam. ... The department stores 
use these young children for inside errands and for wrapping pack- 
ages. A few of them have a chance to become saleswomen if they 
are fitted for it, but in Cincinnati saleswomen are paid such low 
wages that the occupation can scarcely be classed as skilled.” * 
Miss Anne Davis’s investigation of the industries 
open to Chicago children between fourteen and six- 
teen disclosed similar conditions: 
“Most of the employment open to these young wage earners is 
offered by box factories, candy factories, tailor shops, and depart- 
ment stores. Even some individual establishments in this group 
have raised the minimum age of all their employees to sixteen be- 
cause the younger boys or girls are too ‘childish, and they have 
found it ‘an economic waste to bother with them.’ ” 
Other industries in Chicago employing young girls 
in routine operations were engraving, boot and shoe 
manufacturing, molding and picture-frame manufac- 
turing, knitting (cutting threads, sorting, wrapping), 
laundry work (shaking and marking clothes), book- 
binding (feeding wire stitching machines), novelty 
work, and press clipping. Of these occupations Miss 
Davis writes: 
“Tt can readily be seen that all of this miscellaneous work open 
to the child under sixteen is of an unskilled nature and furnishes 
little or no training that may later prove valuable. Children are 
likely to get into the rut of factory work, losing all incentive and 
ambition to progress, or to acquire the habit of continual shifting 
from one job to another. . . . In every case the years between four- 
teen and sixteen spent at work afford little gain either in money

or training and mean much actual loss in strength and mental de- 
velopment.” + 
Surely it is high time, in view of these conditions 
that, not alone educators, but all men and women hay- 
ing a sincere regard for the interests of society, should 
grapple with the problem of the vocational prepara- 
tion of these girls in a spirit of broad-minded intelli- 
gence and with resolution to see it through. Supine 
acceptance of a social situation which deprives thou- 
sands of young girls, endowed with capacities of intelli- 
gence, initiative, imagination, and enthusiasm, of all 
interest in and incentive for work, and which breeds 
in them a restless desire for change, will result in an 
economic and moral waste that will react disastrously 
upon the society that permits it. 
The Problem of Educating Skilled Workers for 
Highly Specialized Industries—The remedy for this 
condition most commonly proposed is that of furnish- 
ing more generous opportunities for general education 
and industrial training to girls fourteen and over, by 
means of trade or continuation schools. A prominent 
labor leader, discussing the failure of American in- 
dustries to develop skilled workers, says: 
“The public school is being called upon to assist the shop and 
factory in an effort to bring about a revival of skill. There is no 
doubt that the school will do its part. Action must be taken, 
however, to compel employers to do their share by so conducting 
the industries that it will be possible for industrial skill to grow 
and develop. Production is neither efficient nor economical unless 
the process develops increased knowledge and skill for the purpose 
of additional and continued production.” 2

-P-A-G-E-198
  188 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
But such a proposal fails to take note of one of the 
most difficult of all the problems in this field, namely, 
how to find, in our highly specialized industries, 
enough skilled positions for the girls who have been 
trained. ‘‘Far more important,’’ declares Leake, 
‘than the lack of skilled workers is the lack of op- 
portunity to use skill in the various industries.’’ 
What course of industrial training, however intelli- 
gently mapped out, can make the work of stuffing 
olives in bottles, lacing shoes, or pasting labels for 
nine hours a day anything but a deadening routine? 
In this connection Leake cites the case of catchers in 
cigarette factories who, during a ten-hour day, will 
catch and examine from 130,000 to 150,000 cigarettes. 
We are told that the movements of girls who pack 
cigars in boxes ‘‘soon become mechanical so that the 
packer keeps her hands and body moving uncon- 
sciously even when she is not packing.’’? It is this sit- 
uation which confronted Miss Anna Hedges when she 
made a study of 617 girls working in factories. The 
purely mechanical character of the work forced her 
to the conviction that ‘‘trade schools belong to the 
past when preparation for trades was needed.’’ ? 
But it may be argued by those of an optimistic frame 
of mind that, even if vocational education has little 
direct bearing upon the monotonous work of thou- 
sands of factory girls, yet it gives them a broader 
outlook upon the meaning and value of their work 
when viewed in relation to the needs of society. To 
the mind of the writer this amiable theory rests upon 
1Leake, op. cit., p. 265, quoting Report of Bureau of Labor Statistics, Vol. 
18, on “Women and Child Wage Earners in the United States.”

University, Contributions to Education, 
   
-P-A-G-E-199
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 189 
dubious foundations and represents an attempt to 
whitewash a situation requiring more radical treat- 
ment. Peculiarly Teutonic in this connection seems 
the pronouncement of the late Professor Miinsterberg: 
“There is no laborer in a mill, no salesman in a store, no 
newspaper boy on the street who cannot and ought not to feel that 
he is a little wheel in the gigantic mechanism, a necessary part 
for the whole. The ideal fulfillment of the economic work of the 
nation ought to be the inspiration for everyone who does a useful 
service, even in the humblest position.” + 
Now it is possible that the cigarette-catcher men- 
tioned above may be led by a course of industrial train- 
ing to be inspired by the thought of herself as ‘‘a 
little wheel in the gigantic mechanism’’ of the nation’s 
economy which she is helping on to its ‘‘ideal fulfill- 
ment’’! But what man or woman who resolutely faces 
facts will believe it? Are we not, then, confronted at 
this point by a parting of the ways? Hither we must 
accept and make the best of a mechanized system of 
industry, in which labor operations will become in- 
creasingly specialized and automatic, especially in 
the case of women, or we must find some means of 
reorganizing industry in the interests of human life. 
Needless to say it is the first alternative—the ac- 
ceptance of the present industrial system accompanied 
by efforts toward its amelioration—which commends 
itself in general to educators and social writers. With- 
in this group, however, there is not entire agreement 
with respect to the problem of training youth for in- 
dustry. Mr. Leake, whose excellent study of the 
Vocational Education of Girls and Women has so fre- 
quently been cited, has sinceresy attempted to envisage 
1 Vocation and Learning (1912), pp. 17-i8,
-P-A-G-E-200
  190 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
the present situation in all its aspects and find some 
way out which will not sacrifice the mental and moral 
development of girl workers. His conclusions may be 
briefly summed up as follows: 
The supply of unskilled workers must be reduced 
(a) by placing on the statute books and enforcing 
compulsory attendance in every state; (b) by raising 
the age of compulsory attendance to sixteen years. 
The objections sure to be raised against the latter 
measure, viz., that it will cripple industries needing 
unskilled workers, and will inflict hardship upon par- 
ents dependent upon their daughters’ earnings, Mr. 
Leake attempts to meet. To the first objection he 
opposes the proposition that ‘‘young human life is too 
precious and too vital to the future welfare of the na- 
tion to be cramped into a mold to meet the demands of 
subdivided, highly specialized, and commercialized in- 
dustries. The industries should exist for the girl and 
not the girl for the industries, and until this view is 
recognized the education of our girls will not be such 
as is demanded by a real civilization.’’ Moreover 
these girls are ‘‘the future wives and mothers of the 
race’’; and those who know the industrial conditions 
under which they work will not question that the ‘‘fu- 
ture of the race is imperilled by the too early entry of 
young girls into industries.’’ The author even makes 
the audacious statement that the future well-being of 
the race depends more upon the ‘‘state of health’’ and 
‘‘poise of mind’’ of these girls ‘‘than it does upon the 
commercial success of onr industries’’! 
The argument that the earnings of girls between 
fourteen and sixteen ar¢ needed by their parents Mr. 
Leake frankly admits t® be valid, although he brings

VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 191 
forward a considerable body of evidence to show that 
the estimates of family need vary greatly in different 
localities, from twenty per cent. of the cases investi- 
gated to seventy per cent. (in a single instance). Five 
of the seven investigations cited show the percentage 
of families in need ranging from twenty to forty-five. 
In only two cases was the percentage above forty-five. 
But, conceding the existence of considerable economic 
need among families, Leake meets the objection by de- 
claring that where ‘‘hardship is really felt by the with- 
drawal of the child’s earnings, this hardship might be 
avoided, or considerably lessened by scholarships or 
maintenance allowances. . . . The state would be fully 
justified in making such allowances.’’? 
Most persons will agree that the three measures ad- 
vocated by Leake, viz., (1) raising the school age to 
sixteen years and offering both general and vocational 
education for the last two or three years; (2) making 
compulsory the attendance of all girls up to this age; 
and (3) paying maintenance allowances to parents 
who would suffer hardship from the enforcement of 
the act seem eminently sound and desirable. But it is 
plain that such provisions merely postpone the prob- 
lem of the kind of training which it is worth while to 
give young girls who will leave our vocational schools 
at sixteen to enter highly specialized and unskilled 
industries. Mr. Leake is not optimistic on this ques- 
tion. He reluctantly admits that the ‘‘time when every 
worker will be able to find congenial employment is far 
distant.’’? But he anticipates that when ‘‘the supply 
of unskilled labor fails, industry will accommodate 
itself to the change, and by reason of a process of 
1 0p. cit., pp. 260-68,

  192 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
readjustment find different work for those who are em- 
ployed in monotonous, soul-wearying tasks.’’ This is 
encouraging. Yet the question will intrude itself as 
to how the accommodation is to be brought about. For 
it seems reasonably clear that no readjustment which 
is not in the immediate interest of employers can hope 
for serious consideration and trial so long as a suffi- 
cient supply of sixteen-year-old girls can be secured 
to perform unskilled operations. 
In the interim, while industry is accommodating 
itself to a restricted supply of immature labor, Mr. 
Leake maintains that the girl workers employed in 
routine tasks must be given education for leisure. 
More generous leisure, he believes, is bound to come 
as a result of shortening the hours of labor. This 
will provide opportunity for an ‘‘avocational educa- 
tion’’ of girls quite outside the industry in which they 
work. He suggests classes for physical education and 
recreation, including folk dancing, games, and physical 
drill to music. Courses might also be offered in per- 
sonal hygiene and the amount and kind of food neces- 
sary to efficient living. In the case of girls too tired 
or indifferent to attend classes for serious study clubs 
might be substituted—‘‘dramatic clubs, reading and 
story-telling clubs, embroidery clubs—ete.’’ Also, 
moving pictures might be put to use in bringing to 
these girls the best literature dramatized for the 
machine.* 
It is obvious enough that Mr. Leake accepts the 
present organization of industry only to deplore it. 
He looks forward to the day when not only will the 
industries ‘‘exist for the girl and not the girl for the 
10p. cit., pp. 268-70.
-P-A-G-E-203
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 193 
industries . . .’’ but when there will be equality of 
educational opportunity for all girls to the extent of 
their capacities. On the contrary, there are other 
educators who seem undisturbed by the problem of 
adjusting education to the existing labor system. 
These writers, of whom Dr. Snedden is an able 
spokesman, are interested primarily in the question 
of fitting young persons for ‘‘vocational efficiency.’’ 
Employers desire habits of industry, application, 
thrift, orderliness, and speed; therefore vocational 
education must keep constantly before it the inculca- 
tion of these habits. It will be seen that, in the judg- 
ment of this educator, the present needs of industry 
must pretty effectually determine the character of 
vocational training. 
“Vocational education” [declares Dr. Snedden,] “must find its 
point of departure primarily in the various divisions of the active 
world of productive effort—the occupations which men and women 
now follow. From these it must in each case work back and so 
elaborate the means and methods capable of producing a fairly 
high and enduring type of vocational efficiency. The final test of 
vocational education is the degree to which it is able to connect 
itself with right standards of efficiency in the economic world.” * 
Using ‘‘present experience’’ as a touchstone, Dr. 
Snedden attacks the question of what is to be done 
with the boy and girl in the years between fourteen 
and sixteen. To him it appears ‘‘not only economi- 
cally but educationally important that shortly after 
fourteen they should find themselves in an atmosphere 
of productive work, whether that be in a vocational 
school or in actual employment. ... It is entirely 
possible that experience will show that the most profit- 
1§nedden, Educational Readjustment, p. 188. 
   
-P-A-G-E-204
194 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
able vocational education can be accomplished by tak- 
ing the boys or girls during these years and giving 
them quite specific training for some definite occupa- 
tion... .’’ It is true that certain idealistic persons 
still believe that the years between fourteen and six- 
teen may be devoted to an education at least in part 
liberalizing, but in the author’s opinion this antici- 
pates a time when ‘‘the economic necessity for early 
employment will not be so pressing as at present.’’ + 
Dr. Snedden then goes on to describe the kind of 
vocational school that will train for industrial effi- 
ciency as that is commonly understood. To be any- 
thing more than a sham such a school must reproduce 
as far as possible the actual conditions of the factory. 
“Shop hours, shop clothing, and provision that a con- 
siderable part of the product shall be capable of being 
marketed’’ should be insisted upon. The advisory 
committee of the school, as well as the teachers, should 
be selected from persons concerned with or trained in 
the industry. Not much attention should be given to 
related general and technical studies in the initial 
stages of work, but on the contrary, a ‘‘fairly sharp 
break with the methods and traditions of academic 
training’’ should be made. Indeed it is probably de- 
sirable that the girl or boy should devote the first 
few months of attendance in an industrial school to 
“mastering the elementary conditions of productive 
work,’’ spending to that end, ‘‘the full working day 
in the workshop under shop conditions... .’’? After 
these months of concentrated experience, during which 
skill and practical knowledge have been developed, 
those studies, such as drawing and mathematics, 
1Ibid., pp. 197-98.
-P-A-G-E-205
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 195 
‘‘which have a distinct bearing on the vocation for 
which training is being had, and which are closely 
related to the projects already worked out’’ may be 
begun. 
But where does this scheme provide for general 
education—education in the art of living wisely, fully 
and happily? The author replies: Rate of output, 
attention to detail, and salability of product ‘‘must 
be the standards held before the pupils if educators 
would avoid trifling, dilettanteism, and formation of 
bad habits.’’ These aims being held uppermost, place 
may be found for ‘‘some general education’’ so organ- 
ized as not to interfere with the systematic vocational 
work. Such studies should ‘‘be arranged to fall 
outside the regular working hours, in the afternoon 
or evening.’’ If time be taken out of the working 
day for education in general subjects such an arrange- 
ment would have an ‘‘injurious reaction’? upon voca- 
tional training, for the reason that in real life ‘‘the 
vocation must claim these hours of the individual’s 
time when the working energies are at their maximum 
strength.’’ Like Herbert Spencer, Dr. Snedden holds 
that leisure hours can best be devoted to cultural pur- 
poses. To this end children may be encouraged to 
form literary and musical clubs to meet in the evening. 
The program of the vocational school itself is sacro- 
sanct, being dedicated to an approximation of ‘‘the 
program of action to be called for by the working 
world.’’ ? 
In commenting on this scheme it may be said that 
it requires no great perspicuity on the part of the 
1 Ibid., pp. 200-205. 
7 Tbid., pp. 190-92.
-P-A-G-E-206
  196 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
reader to perceive that Dr. Snedden ignores a serious 
obstacle to the realization of his plan, namely, how 
young people who have spent eight hours in strenuous 
work under shop conditions are to be induced to attend 
classes and clubs for cultural purposes. Also open to 
question are the two ideas most prominent in this edu- 
cational scheme; first, that vocational schools must re- 
produce as closely as possible the existing conditions of 
industry, so far as hours, dress, speed, accuracy, and 
routine work are concerned; secondly, that liberal edu- 
cation must be sharply divorced from vocational train- 
ing save as mathematics and drawing are closely re- 
lated to mechanical projects. In regard to the first 
point it may be accepted as certain that at least a few 
far-sighted individuals will object to whole-hearted 
acceptance of the present system of industry as the 
starting point of a plan for vocational education. 
More clearly than most educators has Professor Dewey 
seen the social implications of such a program: 
“Any scheme for vocational education which takes its point of 
departure from the industrial régime that now exists, is likely to 
assume and to perpetuate its divisions and weaknesses, and thus 
to become an instrument in accomplishing the feudal dogma of 
social predestination. Those who are in a position to make their 
wishes good, will demand a liberal, a cultural occupation, and one 
which fits for directive power the youth in whom they are directly 
interested. To split the system, and give to others, less fortunately 
situated, an education conceived mainly as specific trade prepara- 
tion, is to treat the schools as an agency for transferring the older 
division of labor and leisure, culture and service, mind and body, 
directed and directive class, into a society nominally democratic.” * 
To the writer this objection seems insuperable. Nor 
is it adequately met by the provision that children in 
1 Democracy and Education, p. 372.
-P-A-G-E-207
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 197 
industry may be encouraged to form musical and lit- 
erary clubs out of working hours. Is it at all probable 
that a girl of fourteen, passing from the elementary 
school to a vocational school which closely reproduces 
shop conditions, will have had opportunity to develop 
taste for good music, literature, art, science or drama, 
strong enough to impel her to carry on any one of these 
liberalizing pursuits during the few hours when she is 
set free from wearisome and ‘‘soul deadening”’ tasks? 
This points to the fundamental defect of most 
schemes of vocational training: they overlook the fact 
that every individual has more than one vocation. In 
its generic sense, of course, a vocation is a calling, a 
continuity of meaningful activities organized around 
some one phase of life. Professor Dewey has clearly 
expressed this idea: 
“Tn the first place each individual has of necessity a variety of 
eallings, in each of which he should be intelligently effective; ... 
No one is just an artist and nothing else, and in so far as one 
approximates that condition he is so much the less developed human 
being; he is a kind of monstrosity. He must, at some period, of his 
life, be a member of a family; he must have friends and companions; 
he must either support himself or be supported by others, and thus 
he has a business career. He is a member of some organized political 
unit, and so on.”* 
It is not too much to say that no vocational educa- 
tion can meet the needs of a democratic society which 
ignores or minimizes the basic fact that no human be- 
ing is merely a worker for a living. Even if we grant, 
as we must, that earning a livelihood is one of the 
most important and time-consuming of the vocations, 
we still are not obliged to regard preparation for that 
2 0p. cit., p. 359. 
   
-P-A-G-E-208
    198 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
calling solely from the narrow viewpoint of the re- 
quirements of industry to-day. The issue seems clearly 
defined. Hither we approach the whole diversified 
problem of vocational education from the vantage 
point of the spiritual needs of a highly developed, hu- 
mane society and of the individual as a free member 
of that society, or we approach it from the angle of 
the needs of ‘‘those who are intrenched in command 
of industrial machinery.’’ 
If the former point of view be accepted, vocational 
schools must acknowledge ‘‘the full intellectual and 
social meaning of a vocation.’’ This would signify, on 
the side of subject-matter, that the students be led to 
appreciate the historic evolution of industry, the part 
that science has played in its development, the ser- 
vices art has rendered to it, and the economic prob- 
lems involved in the contemporary industrial situation. 
On the side of individual mental growth it would mean 
the painstaking development of those intellectual quali- 
ties of imagination, inventiveness and initiative, to- 
gether with the power to meet changing conditions with 
intelligent foresight, which, when accompanied by 
social good-will, are the most precious assets of a 
progressive democracy. Such vocational education, 
of girls as well as boys, would insure the humanizing 
of industry and, therefore, the ultimate betterment of 
society as a whole. 
Intelligence and Vocational Efficiency: An Experi- 
ment.—It hardly needs to be said that little has been 
done in the way of providing such education for boys 
and girls. A, significant experiment, however, has 
been made by Mr. Robert Wolf, manager of certain 
large paper manufactories. Mr. Wolf came to the con-
-P-A-G-E-209
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 199 
clusion that the quality of the paper manufactured in 
his mills was inferior to foreign makes largely because 
of the failure to solve the problem of the best length of 
time to subject the paper pulp to low pressure in the 
‘‘wet machines.’’? Having discovered that three min- 
utes of low pressure gave the best results, the man- 
agement designed an instrument which recorded the 
number of minutes low pressure was kept on, as well 
as the time lost between low and high pressure opera- 
tions. The record of each workman was posted in the 
hope of stimulating competition in efficiency. After a 
record of operations had been kept for some time, it 
was discovered that the men were working at an aver- 
age efficiency of 42 per cent. Mr. Wolf realized that 
the low efficiency of the men operating the machines 
was due to a lack of interest in and understanding of 
the experiment and of the processes involved in work- 
ing it out. He therefore evolved the plan of having 
the foreman explain in detail to each man what the 
recording machine meant and how the men’s efficien- 
cies were obtained. Moreover he put the record- 
ing instrument into a glass case, in the machine 
room, where all the men could easily observe its 
workings. 
As soon as the operatives had grasped the full 
meaning of the experiment, as soon as their intelligent 
interest had been enlisted in its success, their efficiency 
rose to 80 per cent. in less than four weeks, and it never 
fell below that high average during a period of three 
or four years. 
As a result of his experiment Mr. Wolf has become 
a convinced believer in the theory that 80 per cent. of 
the work in even highly mechanized industries could 
 
-P-A-G-E-210
  200 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
be made interesting to the workers if the plan were 
explained to them. He has himself seen men in spe- 
cialized factory labor get together and work out the 
problem of getting rid of one or more mechanical proc- 
esses by combinations and mechanical changes. This 
and similar experiences have made of him an advocate 
of the doctrine that the man who functions consciously, 
who controls his material by the conscious exercise of 
his mental capacities, is an asset to industry through 
the release of his creative power. 
The Creative Impulse in Industry.—It will doubt- 
less occur to readers of this experiment that, after all, 
it does not go very far in stimulating the mental abili- 
ties of the workers; nor is the scheme designed pri- 
marily to educate their capacities for creative work, 
but rather to increase their efficiency. A more thor- 
oughgoing plan for the vocational education of girls 
and boys is that suggested in Miss Helen Marot’s 
thoughtful book, The Creative Impulse in Industry. 
Unlike those critics of our mechanized industries who 
see in them no possibilities for the educational de- 
velopment of the worker, Miss Marot courageously 
declares that ‘‘in machine production and in the divi- 
sion of labor there are emotional and intellectual pos- 
sibilities which were non-existent in the earlier and 
simpler methods of production.’’ It is true that ‘‘this 
technological subject-matter, rich in opportunities for 
associated adventure and infinite discovery, is not a 
part of common experience... .’’ Nevertheless it 
exists and furnishes ‘‘fit matter for making science a 
vital experience in the life of the worker.’’ But such 
a desirable outcome, implying as it does the education 
of the worker through his work, can only be accom-
-P-A-G-E-211
  
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 201 
plished by a more democratic administration of in- 
dustry. And the reason is plain: 
“A democracy of industry,” [says Miss Marot,] “requires a peo- 
ple’s sustained interest in the productive enterprise; their interest 
in the development of technology, the development of markets, and 
the release of man’s productive energy.” * 
Doubtless to some persons this will represent one 
more Utopian dream less realizable than most—and 
less desirable. But how does the author work out in 
practicable form the problem of a vocational school 
which shall realize these ends? Far from accepting as 
satisfactory the present trade and part-time schools 
in this country, Miss Marot characterizes them as 
“makeshift attempts.’’ She suggests that it would be 
well to undertake experiments designed to ‘‘stimulate 
the impulses of youth for creative experience’’ by giv- 
ing them ‘‘an industrial experience where the motive 
of exploitation is absent’’ and the motive of interest 
in work is uppermost. To this end she would have 
workshops established in connection with schools and 
designed for the production of some marketable article. 
These shops should be independently financed not on a 
basis of profits, although the capital invested in them 
might draw a legal rate of interest. Accepting the 
principle emphasized by Dr. Snedden and others that 
the work should be organized on a basis of productive 
efficiency, thus eliminating dilettanteism, the author 
advocates putting the enterprise under the direction 
of managers competent in technological processes. 
The working force would consist of those boys and 
girls who had received both elementary school certifi- 
2 Op. cit., pp. 25-6 (ed. 1918).  
-P-A-G-E-212
  202 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
cates and employment certificates. This force should 
be supplemented by a certain number of adult work- 
ers necessary for the successful conduct of the plant. 
As the younger employees would work in alternate 
shifts in the shop and in the school they would be paid 
on a half-time basis although at market rates. The 
exchange of shifts might be made daily, semi-weekly, 
or weekly as seemed most ‘‘conducive to the health 
and the intellectual experience of the children and to 
the needs of production in the organization of the 
shop.’’+ 
Having sketched the outlines of her plan of organi- 
zation of workshop-schools, Miss Marot next attacks 
the crucial question of the part which technical proc- 
esses shall play in the education of the young workers. 
To her mind the acquisition of technique is only one 
factor, and that not the primary one, in the present- 
day system of production. The educational value of 
technical processes lies in the fact that they afford 
necessary experience for the understanding and evalu- 
ation of workmanship. Even so they contain only a 
fraction of the educative material which workers 
should acquire if they are to be industrially intelligent. 
An exclusive emphasis upon this factor would mean 
that our boys and girls would merely be equipped ‘‘to 
act as factory attachments.’’ Because educators ‘‘have 
fostered the illusion that the educational subject mat- 
ter of industry was inherent in the technical process 
of fabrication’’ they ‘‘have missed the educational 
principle applicable to the craft period, as well as to 
the present, that the condition of the educational re- 
quirement is that the workers’ participation in pro- 
20p. cit., pp. 11-12.
-P-A-G-E-213
  VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 203 
ductive enterprise coincide in the long run with cre- 
ative intention and accomplishment.’ + 
This last statement embodies the kernel of Miss 
Marot’s philosophy. Because she believes that the 
fundamental requirement of all industrial education is 
that young people ‘‘learn to function with conscious 
creative intention in the environment in which they 
live,’’ she would have them engage not alone in the 
mechanical processes of an industry but in those other 
more educative and stimulating activities concerned 
with purchase of raw materials, the relation of me- 
chanical equipment, labor, and raw material to the 
finished product, the securing of markets and the ex- 
tension of the services of the plant. 
Fortunately enough, the author is not content with 
generalities. On the contrary she selects an industry 
—that of the manufacture of wooden toys—and shows 
how a two years’ course might be given in which work- 
shop and school should codperate in giving an all- 
round industrial education to girls and boys. Al- 
though wooden toy manufacturing was the industry 
chosen, Miss Marot declares with conviction that any 
other of the many occupations classed as unskilled 
would serve as well to illustrate her thesis—always 
with the proviso that the industry were chosen because 
it afforded ‘‘an experience where the enterprise of 
production was opened up and the possibilities of cre- 
ative life were realized in association with others, so 
far as the conditions and time allowed.’’ ? 
The wooden toy industry was selected as an example 
because it has educational value for the workers, 
1 Oreative Impulse in Industry, pp. 113-14. Italics mine.

-P-A-G-E-214
  204 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
because its product meets a social demand and there- 
fore has marketable value and, finally, because such an 
experiment in industrial education has been actually 
attempted. The details of the plan call for a toyshop 
with a working staff of forty young people, twenty in 
the shop and twenty in the school at any one time. The 
best standards in use will be held up to the workers 
but their attention will be called to the desirability 
of improving those standards, on the theory that an 
important source for these improvements is the work- 
ers themselves. At this point Miss Marot should 
speak for herself: 
“The workers may acquire the technique of ali or of several 
processes. Their general facility in technique may contribute to 
their productive value in the shop or their mastery over several 
processes may have its educational value for them in relation to 
the industry as a whole; they may to advantage shift from one 
process to another to relieve the strain of routine work. . . . But 
the workers will not be shifted from one construction process to 
another for the sake of learning all the processes, because skill in 
all the processes is not a requisite either of education or of produc- 
tion. The experience in the shipping of goods and in the handling 
of raw materials, in the installation of power, in the upkeep of 
the equipment and the general care of the factory will be partici- 
pated in by all the workers in their turn, according to the require- 
ments of the industry.” * 
Here, then, is a complete repudiation on the one 
hand of the theory that, in the present conditions of 
industry, the merely technical tasks must of necessity 
be turned over to a body of unskilled workers; and, 
on the other hand, that industrial schools must seek 
their educational subject-matter solely within these 
highly specialized processes. On the contrary Miss 
1Ibid., pp. 119-20.
-P-A-G-E-215
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 205 
Marot daringly advocates such an organization of the 
workshop as shall make possible a varied and broadly 
educative experience for the young apprentices in 
every phase of the industry from the technical process 
to the shipping of the product. 
The school plays its part as ‘‘the workshop labora- 
tory where problems which originate in the shop can be 
taken over for analysis and solution. These concrete 
shop problems will represent required school subjects, 
as the progress of the shop and the success of the en- 
terprise depend upon their solution.’? The subjects 
discussed by the author are condensed as follows: 
(1) The technical problems of manufacture, such as receiving 
and storing stock, planning operation, and routine work. 
(2) Keeping the financial accounts and estimating costs. 
(3) Upkeep of the working force, buildings and equipment; 
for example, “the valuation for each worker of his own 
physical condition and expert advice in regard to nutri- 
tion and other physical needs. 
(4) The economies of the enterprise; for example, “the mar- 
ket of the raw material—the study of the market in rela- 
tion to grades, to cost, to transportation, to quantity in 
cost of purchases, to time of purchase.” 
(5) Art and service. While the shop will welcome models 
from the pupils it will be recognized that they have had 
little art experience while “there is a world of designers 
from which to draw.” There will be a jury “composed of 
the workers in the shop, an artist, and one or two people 
who have given the subject of toys careful attention.” 
This jury will pass upon the artistic value of models 
presented. 
(6) Literature and history. “Authentic accounts and in- 
spirational stories of industrial life, especially of lumber, 
the wood-working, and the toy industry will be gathered 
by the pupils and the teachers.” The literary produc- 
tions of the children on these themes “will not be called 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  206 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
for as exercises in the art of writing or of fact-recording 
but as contributions toward the equipment of the 
school. The books which are collected as well as the 
original compositions will be submitted to critical analysis 
and accepted as accessories to the library if they come up 
to standards in authenticity and in literature.” * 
In advocating that experiments similar to the above 
be tried out, Miss Marot throws squarely on the shoul- 
ders of educators the responsibility for determining 
whether the modern system of industry is in reality 
antagonistic to the mental development of the workers. 
‘Without question, it is the business of educators to 
determine whether such features of industry as ma- 
chinery and the division of labor are fundamentally 
opposed to growth or whether they are opposed only 
in the way in which they have been put to use and 
directed.’’ Miss Marot herself believes that, because 
‘the mechanics of associated effort in industry’’ has 
been pretty fully worked out, it is possible for our 
young workers to-day to associate in a creative project 
and to experience the joy of creative effort ‘‘in the 
planning of the work along with the labor of fabrica- 
dion.’ 2 
The Education of Working Girls for Home-Mak- 
ing.—Doubtless a girl who had spent two years in a 
school such as Miss Marot describes could hardly have 
failed to gain insight into the methods by which in- 
dustry is carried on, to build up some historical and 
literary associations with her field of work, to appre- 
ciate the relation of art to manufacture, and to under- 
stand the requirements of personal hygiene and proper 
nutrition. This is excellent, as far as it goes; but 
1]bid., pp. 121-26. 
*Ibid., pp. 135-37.
-P-A-G-E-217
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 207 
there will doubtless be critics to point out that, after 
all, this girl will be something more than an individual- 
istic worker. She will, in all probability, marry and 
become a housewife and mother, as well as a citizen. 
And this leads us to one of the conspicuous problems 
in the education of working girls: How can these 
girls be educated for a dual vocation—that of home- 
maker on the one hand and of skilled worker on the 
other? 
The case of girls in industry presents a somewhat 
different aspect from that revealed by their sisters 
in the professions and highly skilled vocations. In 
the first place a far higher proportion of working girls 
will marry than of college women. Social statistics 
make this abundantly clear. In the second place, 
working girls cannot hope at present to earn in- 
comes commensurate with those of professional wo- 
men, although the disparity in earning power of the 
two groups shows some tendency to lessen. Obviously 
these two facts put together mean, at first glance, that 
most young women in industry will be compelled to 
perform their own household tasks and care for their 
own children, since they will not be able to hire ade- 
quate help. Is it advisable, then, to ignore the educa- 
tion of working girls for the vocation of home-making? 
On this question, as on every other problem in the 
education of women, there are two sharply contrasted 
points of view. Probably the majority of educators, 
both men and women, will be found aligned solidly in 
favor of training girls for a dual sphere. This group 
emphasizes the fact that large numbers of working 
women engage in household tasks after their day’s 
work is done and need intelligent training in the per- 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
    208 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
formance of those tasks. In this connection the fol- 
lowing statements made by Puffer? are of interest: 
“Moreover, of every hundred American girls between school and 
marriage, fifty are either assisting their mothers in their own homes, 
making homes for their relatives, or working for wages under some 
other home-maker. Even of the fifty that remain, who at first glance 
might be counted as being outside the home, more than thirty are 
living under their parents’ roofs or in the homes of relatives. . . . 
Virtually all women . . . will at some time in their lives either 
make homes for themselves or else take a hand with helping other 
women make theirs, while at least half will do both. The chance, 
therefore, that any individual school girl will follow home-making 
as her chief vocation in life is distinctly greater than that any school 
boy of corresponding age will follow the particular career on which 
he has set his mind. This is the one great central fact which con- 
fronts the vocational guide who deals with girls.” 
These are facts that cannot be ignored. They have 
led educators to advocate not only courses in home- 
making in the upper grades of every elementary school 
but also the inclusion of household arts in the scheme 
of industrial education. When, however, the prac- 
tical question of incorporating home-making courses 
into trade and vocational schools is attacked, difficul- 
ties at once appear. The intensive training offered 
in many trade schools, such as the Manhattan Trade 
School in New York City, affords little opportunity 
for giving girls anything more than a rather super- 
ficial acquaintance with the problems of domestic 
economy in its many aspects. Even so cordial a be- 
liever in domestic training as Mrs. Woolman is forced 
to admit that, although the idea of woman as a home- 
maker should be ever present in training teachers of 
industry, ‘‘it cannot be emphasized in the short-time

VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 209 
trade school of industrial cities as it can in vocational 
schools in other localities.’’ 
The disadvantages which result from training work- 
ing girls for the two vocations of industry and home- 
making in our industrial schools have been vigorously 
discussed by a small group of writers familiar with the 
practical problem of vocational training. Out of a 
long experience with working girls, gained as an officer 
in the National Women’s Trade Union League, Mrs. 
Raymond Robins writes with conviction on this 
subject: 
“One of the great difficulties which a young girl has to face in 
industrial education is this: we women are asked to play a double 
part. We function in two very different ways. In one as a bread- 
winner for, on the average, seven years, and then as a wife and 
mother. So strong is the feeling with us in America that the young 
girl is potentially the wife and mother, and that her training as 
such must overbalance all other training, that we still have a good 
deal of confusion on the subject of industrial education for girls. 
The average man or woman asks that our young women be trained 
primarily in all that pertains to household art, in all that pertains 
to developing the girls’ possibilities and skill to be used in later 
life as wife and mother. . . . This brings about some very danger- 
ous results in the trade schools for boys and girls. Let me give you 
an illustration. There is an agricultural school in one of our Eastern 
cities, where the girls and boys are taught the possibilities of bread- 
winning as agricultural laborers, agriculturists, gardeners, florists, 
or what ever you will. When it comes to the boy, he learns the 
chemistry of the soil, and gets down to fundamental things in those 
particulars, but the girl is taught cooking and sewing. I am not 
saying that cooking and sewing are not necessary, but when we 
cheat a girl out of the training she ought to have for her bread- 
winning capacity, and substitute something which has nothing to do 
with the trade she is trying to learn, then we make a great and 
grave mistake.” *

Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education, Bulletin No. 10, p. 78.

  210 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
Quite as emphatic is Miss Florence Marshall, Prin- 
cipal of the Manhattan Trade School for’Girls: 
“We have idealized about girls too long. We have many cherished 
notions about what they ought to do and be. We should like so 
much to see them taught a little domestic science and art, hygiene 
and home nursing, and a few other things, and then see them com- 
fortably settled in homes of their own away from all perplexing 
problems which our industrial life presents. When, however, we 
discover that in some of our cities 77 out of every 100 girls (16 to 
20) are working for pay outside of the home; . . . then we realize 
that we are confronted with a condition and not a theory—a con- 
dition which demands an intensely practical treatment. We realize 
that to achieve our ideals we cannot afford to be doctrinaires who 
refuse to allow our theories to associate with conflicting facts; that 
we must not be like the Reverend Amos Barton ‘whose plans were 
admirably conceived had the state of the case been otherwise,’ but, 
accepting the fact that under present conditions girls are and must 
be wage earners, must we not insist that they be trained for wage- 
earning occupations, which means growth and not stagnation?” * 
Recognizing the difficulty of training working girls 
for two vocations in schools designed to train them 
for industry, Dr. Snedden holds that schools should 
be established in every locality to afford young women 
from eighteen to twenty-five who have been employed 
in stores and factories a practical, intensive education 
in home-making at the time when they most need it. 
Obviously such practical training would benefit by all 
the impulsive force which springs from real motiva- 
tion and interest. Suggestions for working out such 
a plan are offered by the rural home economics schools 
in Denmark. Before their establishment it was custom- 
ary to send betrothed girls living in the rural dis- 
tricts to some prosperous, well-managed home where

they could get a year’s apprenticeship in the practical 
tasks of housekeeping. Since the organization of 
household arts schools, however, young women about 
to be married have attended these schools in large 
numbers to obtain an intensive practical training com- 
bined with much sound theory. Foght thus describes 
these schools: 
“The young women are expected to reside at the school during 
their continuance therein. The courses are usually six months in 
Jength. . . . The buildings are equipped with model kitchen, dining- 
room, living-room, and bedrooms, all of them intended as models 
for practical farm homes.” * 
Obviously it would not be possible to establish simi- 
lar residential schools in the crowded industrial cen- 
ters of the United States. But would it not be practi- 
cable to set up public day-schools of household arts to 
which young working women could resort before or 
after marriage for the skill and knowledge necessary 
for successful home-making? Such schools might well 
offer general courses to both men and women treating 
of the basic functions of the family institution in social 
life, the numberless points at which the home touches 
that life for good or ill, and the influences at work 
to-day to disintegrate it. Both sexes could profit from 
practical education in budget-making, in household 
sanitation, in an intelligent selection of foods, cloth- 
ing, and house-furnishings such as would increase the 
well-being of their families and enhance the beauty of 
life. 
By the organization of public schools of household 
arts, distinct from trade or industrial schools, the 
1“Education in Denmark,” in Sandiford, Comparative Education, pp.

  212 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
demand of society that young women be fitted for home- 
making as an important vocation of life would be 
met. At the same time girls would not suffer, in their 
education for wage-earning, by being compelled to 
divide their energies and time between two vocations. 
It seems reasonably certain that an ever-swelling 
stream of women, married as well as single, will take 
up gainful employments outside the home. The state- 
ment of Mr. Puffer that ‘‘the relations of men, women, 
and work have now virtually completed their adjust- 
ment .. .’’ is absurd upon its face. As stated above, 
the number of women in gainful occupations has stead- 
ily increased during the last three decades.1 Even 
ten years ago the census figures showed that 25.4 per 
cent. of this army of women workers was composed 
of married women. The corresponding figures in the 
forthcoming census of 1920 will reveal how far this 
country has gone in the direction of making its women, 
both married and single, independent wage-earners. 
The Wage-Earning Life of Women.—It may be ob- 
jected at this point that even if young women do 
take up gainful employments they drop these after a 
few years to marry and make a home. Therefore why 
spend time in training them? The writer’s studies 
have led her seriously to question the popularly ac- 
cepted theory that the wage-earning life of women is 
only from five to seven years in length. A recent in- 
vestigation made by the Division of Education of the 
Russell Sage Foundation throws considerable doubt 
on this assumption. The investigators sought to dis- 
cover the ages of women gainfully employed in cities 
of 50,000 and over with a view to determining how 
1 Life and Labor, Nov., 1919, p. 106.
-P-A-G-E-223
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 213 
many years they had been wage-earners. They selected 
only those occupations in which women were employed 
in a ratio exceeding one for every one thousand of the 
population. With these limitations the number of wo- 
men included in the study was 857,743. The occupa- 
tions chosen were teacher, laundress, housekeeper, 
nursemaid, saleswoman, dressmaker, and domestic ser- 
vant. Leake summarizes the results as follows: 
‘More than half of those engaged in each occupation 
were over the following ages: housekeepers, forty; 
nursemaids, thirty-six; laundresses, thirty-four; sales- 
women, twenty-three; teachers, thirty-two; dress- 
makers, thirty-one; and servants, thirty-seven.’’ Leake 
adds the comment that ‘‘it is fairly safe to assume that 
those who were working at the age of forty, thirty, and, 
in the majority of cases, at twenty-five had been so 
engaged for more than seven years.’’? 
In view of the facts revealed by this investigation 
and other social studies, it would seem the part of wis- 
dom to accept a situation in which millions of girls and 
women are employed in gainful occupations for vary- 
ing periods of years and see to it that before entering 
upon their vocations they be given as thorough and 
all-round preparation for work as is given to their 
brothers. Training for a subsequent vocation as 
home-makers should unquestionably be furnished such 
women as need it in special schools maintained by pub- 
lic funds. In the years to come it is conceivable that 
schools of this nature might be restricted to the task 
of training women in household arts as a profession, 
although no confident prophecy can be made on this 
matter. It was stated in a previous chapter that there 
1The Vocational Education of Girls and Women, pp. 6-7. 
   
-P-A-G-E-224
  214 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
has been in European countries, especially in England, 
a rather promising development of municipal or na- 
tional kitchens. These kitchens, established in Great 
Britain purely as a war emergency measure, are rap- 
idly becoming a recognized part of the social organi- 
zation of the country. They provide nutritious and 
well-cooked food at the lowest prices consistent with 
self-support (not profit) and represent an enormous 
economy of labor by the collective preparation of food. 
National kitchens serve the needs of all classes, from 
the well-to-do to the very poor, and are in no sense a 
charitable enterprise. So valuable have they proven 
that, on the petition of a local council, the British 
Government will advance, free of interest, the whole 
capital cost of establishing the kitchen. The sole con- 
dition is that the loan be repaid in ten equal install- 
ments. In December, 1918, about 1,000 of these kitchens 
had been set up all over the country. To each kitchen 
is attached a restaurant. Here families may come for 
a cheap and appetizing meal; or the food may be taken 
home to be eaten at the family table. Writing on the 
social benefits conferred by these kitchens an English- 
woman says: 
“If a woman is a breadwinner, in factory, or workshop, the 
national kitchen is a special boon. She can turn in there at midday, 
or if that is impossible she can arrange with a kindly neighbor to 
bring the food to her home; and there, when she comes back tired 
in the evening, she can warm it quickly and so be saved all the 
preliminary worry of planning and cooking.” 
Likewise the busy mother can bring her children with 
her 
“and in new surroundings away from the atmosphere in which she 
works—in itself a boon, and one which well-to-do folk are apt to
-P-A-G-E-225
  
VOCATIONAL EDUCATION OF WORKING GIRLS 215 
overlook, since they never have to consider it—sit down in peace 
and quiet and enjoy a good meal.” * 
To those critics who will doubtless attack this 
scheme on the ground that ‘‘it will destroy the home”’ 
it may be said by way of encouragement that the in- 
dividualistic tendencies of the American people have 
thus far successfully resisted most movements looking 
toward codperation in the organization of essential life 
activities. Nevertheless, if girls and women continue 
to crowd into industry and to desert domestic service, 
and if the tendency for women to remain at work after 
marriage gains strong headway, we may yet see the 
labor of thousands of individual homes professional- 
ized and carried on by intelligent collective effort.

CHAPTER VII 
THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
The Need of Society for Socially Trained Women.— 
In the face of the unsettled social conditions now pre- 
vailing in all civilized lands and of the bitter enmities 
and disruptive forces bred by the World War, there 
are not lacking discerning souls who maintain that 
the primary function of schools and colleges to-day is 
the socialization of the girls and boys, the young men 
and women of the nation upon whose shoulders will 
shortly fall the responsibilities of active citizenship. 
By ‘‘socialization’’ these individuals mean: 
First, the education of youth in enlightened understanding of 
existing social conditions and needs as these have evolved from the 
economic and social circumstances of the past. 
Secondly, the development of a spirit of active friendliness and 
good-will toward all men, as individuals and as members of or- 
ganized groups and nations. 
Thirdly, the training of boys and girls in habits of social action 
to further desirable social ends. 
To these aims of ‘‘socialized’’ education in the 
larger community sense of the word should be added 
more personal aims—the development in young wo- 
men of a fine consideration and courtesy in the social 
relations of life which is the expression of a sincere 
regard for the peace of mind and happiness of their 
fellow beings. Such regard for others should coexist 
with a respect for one’s own ‘‘best self’? and a firm 
217 
   
-P-A-G-E-228
  218 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
desire to regulate one’s social conduct by an intelli- 
gent comprehension of its social consequences. 
Perhaps few educators would disagree, in theory, 
with these propositions. But such agreement would 
not necessarily do away with an existing obstacle to 
the realization of the ends they set forth. This ob- 
stacle is unquestionably the rooted tendency of teach- 
ers, particularly in high schools and colleges, to appeal 
exclusively to the intellect of their students, to regard 
their task as primarily the enlargement of the stu- 
dents’ store of information and the development of 
their power to think and judge in some one of the 
theoretical fields of knowledge. This historic weakness 
of the teachers in our higher schools is of course no 
secret. It has frequently been satirized by the practical 
minded and criticized by educational philosophers— 
with but meagre results. Hngrossment in the purely 
theoretical and factual phases of their subject causes 
these well-meaning intellectualists blandly to ignore 
the fact that their students are living in a world that 
demands social enlightenment and habits of social co- 
6peration even more insistently than it demands knowl- 
edge of higher mathematics and modern languages. 
The melancholy harvest of this ‘‘academic’’ sowing is 
everywhere apparent. Thousands of young women are 
graduated every year from school and college with at 
best only a feeble interest in community and national 
affairs—an interest which contrasts glaringly with an 
almost feverish concern for the allurements of the ball- 
room, the motor car, and the ‘‘movies.’’ This result 
is the more deplorable when one considers the urgent 
need of society for wise leadership in this time of 
far-reaching changes in social and economic condi-
-P-A-G-E-229

tions. On every side is heard the call for educated men 
and women with social outlook and capacity to organ- 
ize and initiate. During the World War this need was 
expressed by the Commissioner of Education in a letter 
to high school principals: 
“When the war is over there will be made upon us such demands 
for men and women of knowledge and training as have never before 
come to any country. . . . The world will have to be rebuilt, and 
American college men and women must assume a large part of the 
task. . . . To you comes that call clear and strong as it has seldom 
come to young men and women anywhere in the world at any time. 
For your country and for the world—for the immediate and the far- 
reaching future you should respond.” 
In a peculiar sense the girls and women of to-day 
are in need of a broader social training to combat age- 
old individualistic attitudes and habits. Doubtless the 
student of the historic evolution of the life of women 
has ample cause for encouragement. The signs that 
women are abandoning the social isolation enforced 
by a restricted domestic life are many and various; 
and there is every reason to believe that the extension 
of the franchise to women will prove an unequalled 
means of social education to them as it has to many of 
their brothers. Nevertheless it would require a some- 
what blind optimism to believe that women as a whole 
are as actively interested in public issues as are men 
(however deficient the latter may be in this regard), 
or that women have a highly developed sense of re- 
sponsibility for the removal of those conditions of mal- 
adjustment that breed friction and discontent in the 
social body. It is not surprising that women in general 
are more individualistic than men, more given to limit- 
ing their social interests and activities to the sphere of 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  220 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
personal contacts. THeir induction into the bustling 
world of industry, of social movements, and of poltical 
activity is still too recent and too partial to‘have ac- 
complished all that may be hoped for in the years 
ahead. Nevertheless, the call to work for the public 
good comes to women no less insistently than to men. 
‘When a young college woman, holding an important 
post in Paris during the late war, was asked what 
special message she would send back to her American 
sisters if she could send but one, she promptly replied: 
“Tell them there is no limit to what they can do. But 
they’ve got to get ready for what’s ahead. They must 
be training now, to be ready when the time comes.”’ 
In a recent article in the Teachers College Record, 
Professor Ellwood vigorously expresses himself on 
the question of the vital importance of the social 
studies in education: 
“Most [educators] would probably agree also with the inference 
that the school should reproduce in miniature—though in a selected, 
simplified, and controlled manner—the social activities of the com- 
munity. Many, however, still seem to shrink from the conclusion that 
social studies should be made central in the curriculum of the school; 
that good citizenship implies social intelligence and that social intel- 
ligence is impossible in our complex modern world without knowledge 
of concrete social conditions and problems. Yet, it is clear that in 
a democracy this is what the taking of the social process as the 
‘pattern’ of the educative process implies. For in a democracy the 
people must solve their own problems and the opinion and will of 
every individual count in determining the wisdom or unwisdom 
which shall be shown in their solution. . .. The greatest foe of 
democracy, it follows, is ignorance, especially social and political 
ignorance; and the chief concern of democracy is education, not in 
the sense of individualistic culture, but in the sense of social edu- 
cation. That this is more or less clearly realized in all democratic 
societies is shown by the attention given it by the press, the public
-P-A-G-E-231
Sm 
THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 221 
assembly, and other agencies of popular‘enlightenment. The schools, 
however, must obviously be the main reliance in a democracy for 
securing social and political intelligence. It is surely time that they 
be democratized, but no one can seriously claim that they are 
democratized, until they undertake the democratic social process of 
awakening and informing citizens about the problems of the com- 
munity and of leading them to aid in their solution. This means 
that social studies, studies which deal with the problems of com- 
munity life, must be made central in the educative process of our 
schools from the kindergarten up, just as the consideration of social 
problems is central in the democratic social sense. Linguistic, in- 
tellectual, and vocational training are, of course, necessary auxiliaries, 
but as good citizenship in the sense in which we have defined it is 
the end, there can be no doubt that social studies are central in a 
democratized education.” * 
If it be admitted that no system of education can 
meet the needs of a progressive democracy which does 
not set as its controlling purpose the socialization of 
young people, deliberately subordinating the aims of 
development of knowledge, thought-power, esthetic 
appreciation, and skill to that supreme end, the path 
is cleared for the consideration of certain practical 
questions: (1) What is being done in high schools 
and colleges to develop social attitudes and habits? 
(2) What difficulties stand in the way of a broader 
social education of young women? (3) What remains 
to be done to attain the end more fully?

The Course of Study.—The question of what is 
actually being done in colleges to further the social 
education of women falls under two heads: (1) what is

-P-A-G-E-232
222 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
being done by way of the course of study and class- 
room work, (2) by way of extra-curricular activities? 
During the last twenty years the enrichment of the tra- 
ditional liberal arts course by the addition of the social 
sciences has been a marked tendency in higher educa- 
tion. An examination of the catalogues of women’s 
colleges and state universities alike reveals a rich and 
varied offering of courses in economics and sociology. 
These tange from introductory general courses in these 
fields to more specialized courses in Public Utilities, 
Corporations, Railroads, Taxation, The Modern Labor 
Movement, Socialism and Social Reform, the Social 
Treatment of Dependents, Immigration, Methods of 
Social Research, and Statistics applied to social and 
economic data. None of the women’s colleges exam- 
ined offers less than eight courses in economics and 
sociology, while Wellesley and Smith each offer twenty 
courses in these fields. Richest of all are the offerings 
in certain of the great state universities of the Middle 
West, notably the University of Minnesota with twen- 
--ty-eight courses, and the University of Michigan with 
at least forty courses, exclusive of business finance and 
accounting. 
Significant of the quickened interest of intelligent 
people in social and economic problems and the meth- 
ods of their attack is the organization of the Carola 
Woerishoffer Graduate Department of Social Heon- 
omy and Social Research at Bryn Mawr. True to the 
firmly established policy of the eastern women’s col- 
leges that all preparation for a life career be strictly 
separated from undergraduate work and relegated to 
the field of graduate study, Bryn Mawr’s excellent 
Department of Social Economy is restricted to stu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-233
  THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 223 
dents holding the bachelor’s degree. Thus it is pos- 
sible for large numbers of young women to be gradu- 
ated from Bryn Mawr, as from other women’s colleges, 
with but a slender equipment for understanding the 
complicated social and economic issues of the day and 
with scant experience in social codperation. During 
the World War, Smith College likewise organized a 
summer training course in Psychiatric Social Work 
which developed into the Smith College Training 
School for Social Work. The Smith College Bulletin 
for 1919-1920 states: 
“The success of this school, together with the perplexities of social 
reconstruction on a vast scale, suddenly thrust upon us, have been 
responsible for the development of the present school, with train- 
ing courses for Psychiatric Social Work, Medical Social Work, and 
Community Service, and with a summer course of specialized char- 
acter in Child Welfare.” 
It seems regrettable that these courses, including both 
theoretical and practical work, are open only ‘‘to 
graduates of colleges of approved standing and to a 
few exceptional persons of equivalent preparation.’’ 
Thus the undergraduate at Smith cannot benefit by 
the excellent training in community service that is 
afforded. 
The Neglect of Practice.—It is interesting to note 
that very few of the undergraduate courses in the 
social sciences given in the women’s colleges and in 
some coeducational institutions combine study of social 
theories with practical social work. Indeed the writer 
clearly recalls the remarks of the head of the depart- 
ment of sociology in an eastern college for women to 
the effect that undergraduate study in this field should 
be sharply separated from practice. This professor
-P-A-G-E-234
224 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
openly deplored the efforts made by a group of his 
students to link their study of sociology with social 
investigations and with the organization of working 
girls’ clubs in the neighboring town. In the minds of 
advocates of ‘‘culture’’ the methods suitable to the 
development of undergraduates diverge widely from 
those that may properly be utilized in graduate pro- 
fessional study, where ‘‘theory and practice are 
deemed essential parts of one whole.’’? It would seem 
that the psychological laws of learning which demand 
first-hand acquaintance with the facts and the prob- 
lems of any field of knowledge, so far as this imme- 
diate experience is attainable, do not apply to the men- 
tal operations of the undergraduate mind. This mind, 
we are asked to believe, thrives best on abstract theory, 
on information detached from concrete experience. 
Eastern colleges for women, therefore, would definitely 
reject Dr. Cabot’s statements about the learning proc- 
ess, so far as they applied to the young women of the 
undergraduate body: 
“Learning medicine is not fundamentally different from learning 
anything else. If one had 100 hours in which to learn to ride a 
horse or speak in public, one might spend, perhaps, one hour (in 
divided doses) in being told how to do it, four hours in watching a 
teacher do it, and the remaining ninety-five hours in practice, at 
first with close supervision, later under general supervision.” * 
It may be objected at this point that Dr. Cabot is 
discussing the learning process as it relates to a prac- 
tical art like medicine or a skilled activity like horse- 
manship; that he has no idea of pointing his state- 
ments at purely theoretical learning such as is involved

in the study of economies and sociology. But it is pre- 
cisely this insistence upon the abstract and generalized 
character of these studies and the unwillingness to 
discover how far textbook theories square with ex- 
perience or can be put to social use that has resulted 
in the situation that confronts us to-day, where large 
numbers of college women are satisfied to stand aside 
and critically observe the epoch-making changes tak- 
ing place in industry and social life with no definite 
purpose of bringing their own intelligence and good- 
will to bear upon these transitional forces in the hope 
of guiding them to socially useful outcomes. In brief, 
college education in the social sciences may be fairly 
indicted as producing too few women who are socially 
minded and who have formed habits of social codpera- 
tion and initiative. Women like Jane Addams, Kath- 
erine Bement Davis, Julia Lathrop, Anna Howard 
Shaw, shine like beacon lights among the ever-growing 
body of liberally educated women who neither initiate 
social improvements nor lend effective help in carry- 
ing them out. During the fifty and more years in 
which women have been given opportunities for col- 
lege education it would, perhaps, be possible to match 
every college graduate who became an outstanding 
figure in progressive social movements with one of her 
sisters like Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott, Clara 
Barton, Mrs. Raymond Robins, and Rose Schneider- 
mann who never received the benefits of college educa- 
tion. And yet the twentieth century ideal of culture 
demands not only broad knowledge and a well-trained 
mind but also requires that both knowledge and 
trained powers be put to work in socially useful 
ways.

Field Work in the State Universities—The showing 
of the state universities with respect to practice and 
field work is, as might be expected of those more adapt- 
able institutions, better than that of the women’s col- 
leges. Several universities offering a wide range of 
courses in economics and sociology combine field work 
with theoretical instruction. Outstanding among these 
universities is Minnesota, which has organized a 
training course in Social and Civie Work. This course 
has been established within the ‘‘College of Science, 
Literature, and the Arts’’ and covers both undergradu- 
ate and graduate work. According to the Bulletin 
issued by the University the ‘‘requirements for both 
entrance and graduation conform to those of the Arts 
College. Satisfactory completion of the four years’ 
course leads to the degree of Bachelor of Science.’? A 
fifth year’s work is offered which will satisfy both the 
requirements of the training course and the Graduate 
School and leads to a special certificate of proficiency 
in social and civic work, together with the degree of 
Master of Arts. The course aims to give the student 
“the fundamentals of a broad modern education with 
considerable emphasis upon history, economics, po- 
litical science, psychology, and language.’’ Special- 
ized study with field work is reserved almost wholly 
for the senior year. While the undergraduate course 
‘should confer upon the student a certain degree of 
familiarity with the problems of social and civic work’’ 
the university authorities declare that ‘‘really ade- 
quate professional preparation demands at least one 
year of graduate study.’’ 
Worth quoting in full is the statement of the Bulle- 
tim regarding the purpose of the course:
-P-A-G-E-237
  THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN — 227 
“This is distinctly a vocational course. Only those students there- 
fore who display evidence of real capacity and the professional 
spirit will be encouraged to go on with graduate study. This does 
not mean that qualified students who have a special interest in certain 
courses are debarred; to the contrary they will be welcomed and 
every effort will be made to meet their specific needs. Nor does it 
mean that students who do not plan to earn their living by pro- 
fessional social work are to be denied entrance. As a matter of 
fact, it is to be devoutly hoped that many students will elect the 
course as a training for effective citizenship and volunteer social work 
or as an adjunct to other vocations.” * 
Here, then, is a college of science and arts cour- 
ageous enough to offer a ‘‘distinctly vocational 
course’’ in the social sciences and enlightened enough 
to appreciate the need of ‘‘many students’’ for such a 
course as a means to worthy and effective citizenship. 
Moreover the university does not hesitate to combine 
practice with theory. In addition to the general 
courses in sociology, economics, social psychology, 
modern social reform movements, etc., there is intro- 
dueed, as early as the junior year, a course in Housing 
Problems which involves field work and one on State 
Care of Dependents, Defectives, and Delinquents in 
Minnesota, during which addresses are given by ex- 
perts from the institutions under consideration. It 
is in the senior year, however, that the emphasis on 
practical experience is strongest. Field-work and 
“‘practice work’’ are required in the following senior 
courses: Social Statistics and Social Surveys, Settle- 
ment and Community Center Work, Charitable Admin- 
istration, Finance and Publicity, Juvenile Courts and 
Probation, Technique of Family Treatment and Field 
Italics mine, 
 
-P-A-G-E-238

Work in Hospital Social Service. If the student takes 
the recommended year of graduate study a very con- 
siderable part of his time ‘‘is devoted to supervised 
field work with selected social agencies and institutions 
in and around the Twin Cities. Moreover, every op- 
portunity is taken to bring to the students specialists 
and experts from the various fields of social work, in 
order to build up the professional attitude and to 
establish professional contacts.’ + 
Likewise the University of Michigan offers under- 
graduate courses in sociology involving visits to in- 
stitutions for defectives, delinquents, and criminals, as 
well as a direct examination of the modern methods 
for the care of dependent classes. Furthermore, the 
university catalogue states that credit will be given 
advanced students for field work done under the 
supervision of one of the Detroit social agencies. Its 
motive in so doing is clearly set forth: ‘‘The great 
demand at the present time for social workers with ex- 
perience makes it of advantage to students, looking to 
social work as an occupation, to get as much practical 
experience as they can in connection with their class 
work in the University.’’ 
On the whole, then, it seems clear that certain state 
universities of the West are more hospitable than 
women’s colleges to the notion that the social sciences 
do not suffer in cultural value when they are put to 
practical use, either in professional preparation for 
social work or as a training in effective and worthy 
citizenship. Who knows but that America in time may 
be won over to the ancient Greek ideal of civic worth 
as the controlling aim of education?

Social Education through Extra-Curricular Activi- 
ties: Findings of a Questionnaire.—When we turn to 
an examination of the extra-curricular activities car- 
ried on in universities and colleges educating women 
we are confronted by a bewildering variety of organi- 
zations. A few months ago the author sent out a 
questionnaire to more than one hundred of the leading 
colleges and universities of the country where women 
are admitted. The questions asked were as follows: 
I. Is any deliberate effort made in your college (or university) to 
provide for the social education of young women? 
II. Is there any organized plan for drawing retiring or self- 
centered girls into group relationships? 
III. Are there organizations in your college (or university) whose 
purpose is to bring young women into contact with the problems and 
needs of the community and to furnish opportunities for active co- 
operation and service? 
IV. Are there clubs for the political education of young women, 
including debating clubs on public questions? 
‘VV. What other means are employed to give young women social 
interests (in the larger community meaning) together with a sense 
of social responsibility? 
VI. What opportunities for leadership are afforded young women 
in your college (or university)? What (estimated) proportion of 
the women students in the graduating class have had little or no 
opportunity to develop capacities for leadership and organization 
during their undergraduate course? 
VII. Is it probable that a considerable number of young women 
will be graduated from your institution in June without having been 
successfully drawn into group relationships or given an active in- 
terest in community and national questions? 
Replies were received from nearly fifty per cent. of 
the colleges and universities addressed—from twenty- 
one colleges for women and twenty-five coeducational 
institutions. These reports showed a very wide sweep 
of student organizations including the Y.W.C.A.
-P-A-G-E-240
  230 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
Student Self-Government Association, Departmental 
Clubs, Class Organizations, College Publication Com- 
mittees, Debating Clubs, Sororities, Honorary So- 
cieties for Women, and Political Clubs. By far the 
greater number of these societies were organized by 
the students themselves and were solely concerned with 
college and academic interests. 
An analysis of the replies in detail reveals some in- 
teresting facts. In the answers to Question I (see 
above) reference was made to one or all of the follow- 
ing ‘‘deliberate’’ means of social education: (1) the 
work of student organizations, (2) courses in history 
and sociology, (3) lectures by visiting speakers on cur- 
rent questions and social work, and by the Dean of Wo- 
men on ‘‘Social Requirements,’’ (4) the efforts of the 
wardens of residential halls to give much needed social 
training, (5) a course for freshman girls on the Fun- 
damentals of College Life, (6) special ‘‘attention ... 
paid to table manners and every Freshman . . . taken 
to teas and receptions by upper class girls,’’ (7) efforts 
of Greek letter sororities to provide ‘‘social experi- 
ence,’’ (8) faculty and student committees, (9) ‘‘class 
functions—especially formal ones,’’ (10) department 
clubs, (11) attempts by women faculty members and 
wives of faculty members. Only three institutions de- 
clared that nothing was being done or that there was 
no ‘‘organized plan’’; and only two Deans of Women 
expressed doubt or dissatisfaction with the means 
employed. One of these writes that some deliberate 
work is being done ‘‘but not enough.’’ Another de- 
clares that the ‘‘social aspects of our university life 
constitute one of the pressing problems with which the 
Dean of Women has to deal.’’ She adds in general
-P-A-G-E-241
THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 231 
vein: ‘‘We are trying in every way to make our wo- 
men students realize their social responsibilities; to 
give them the right social ideals.’’ Still another dean 
writes: ‘‘We are trying this year to work out a real 
plan by which a greater variety of social life shall be 
provided on the campus.”’ 
A critical examination of the replies to Question I 
shows pretty clearly the following conditions: 
(1) The word “social” is interpreted by many institutions in the more 
restricted sense as applied to education in the amenities of 
social intercourse. 
(2) The onus of responsibility for the social education of college 
girls appears to fall upon the students themselves, assisted by 
the Dean of Women, who may or may not summon to her aid 
faculty women and wives of faculty members. 
(3) The “deliberate” efforts of college and university to socialize 
women students consist largely in reliance upon existing stu- 
dent agencies, especially upon the Y.W.C.A., the Student 
Self-Government Association and the sororities where they 
exist. There is little evidence in the replies received of a care- 
fully thought out scheme of social education designed to enlist 
the codperation of faculty and students alike. In short the aim 
of developing “civic worth” in college women students has not 
been made the subject of serious consideration and far-sighted 
planning on the part of most college authorities. Both aim and 
methods are in too many instances adventitious, being annexed 
more or less casually to the intellectual work of the college. This 
holds true even of the conscientious efforts of deans of women 
to provide for the social training of the young women in their 
charge. 
The Problem of the Individualistic Girl—The sec- 
ond question in the questionnaire had reference to 
the existence of any ‘‘organized plan for drawing re- 
tiring or self-centered girls into group relationships.’’ 
The replies received indicate that the college authori-  
-P-A-G-E-242
    232 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
ties, in general, are content to leave the social train- 
ing of the shy or individualistic girl to the student 
organizations in the hope that some one of the various 
campus activities may appeal to her tastes and develop 
her social capacities. Some of the answers definitely 
referred to the efforts of the Y.W.C.A. to draw out 
retiring girls; while others mentioned the system of 
junior and senior adviserships as a means of drawing 
freshmen into college organizations. One eastern col- 
lege wrote of a large student gathering in the fall at 
which the different clubs and organizations presented 
their plans and purposes to the new students and tried 
to secure as new members those who would be most 
interested. The reply continues: ‘‘A few students 
probably fail to accept the invitation and are not 
necessarily followed up indefinitely.’’ Reference was 
also made by two or three colleges to a ‘‘freshman 
questionnaire’’ carried on by the Student Government 
Association in order to discover the ‘‘non-academic’’ 
interests of freshmen and the offices held by them in 
preparatory schools. 
Obviously these attempts to reach self-centered girls 
are made by the students themselves, chiefly for the 
purpose of strengthening and perpetuating their or- 
ganizations. Nevertheless it would be quite unfair to 
imply that the problem of the unsocial girl has not 
challenged the attention of a few discerning spirits 
among the officers of our colleges and universities— 
usually the Dean of Women and an occasional woman 
instructor. The ‘‘Big Sister’? movement, also, is the 
outgrowth of a consciously felt need for reaching 
lonely and retiring girls in order to interest them in 
their fellow students as well as in the activities of
-P-A-G-E-243
THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 233 
some group. One eastern college has clearly felt this 
problem, for its Dean of Women writes: ‘‘In the Y.W. 
C.A. a committee, codperating with the Dean of Wo- 
men, goes over the list of students, noting those not 
active in any organization, and arranging to have some 
committee secure their services. A ‘‘presidents’ 
Council,’ composed of the executive officers of the 
young women’s societies, ‘‘considers the list of those 
doing active work, and those needing to undertake it, 
and endeavors to place in congenial work those need- 
ing it.’? A large western university specially dele- 
gates the senior advisors ‘‘to help every woman enter- 
ing ... in making connections with groups of con- 
genial tastes, within which she may find opportunity 
for development of initiative and executive ability.”’ 
One eastern university, also consciously attacking the 
problem, relies on the Junior Advisory system main- 
tained by the Women’s Self-Government Association 
and on a careful organization of the social life in its 
“smaller houses for girls.’? This method is also pur- 
sued in one of the leading women’s colleges, whose 
dean writes: ‘‘We believe that our small dormitories 
(the cottage system) give the shy and retiring girl a 
chance to feel herself a not unimportant. member of a 
group.’’? Another woman writes: ‘‘The Dean is free 
to call the attention of the President of the S.S.G.A. 
to any retiring or self-centered girl and she never fails 
to meet with a cordial response and an effort on the 
part of the upper-class girls to aid in helping girls who 
should be brought forward and interested in social 
life.’’ One university dean declares that the task of 
developing individualistic girls is assigned to a ‘‘point 
scale committee’’ which ‘‘has as one of its fundamental 
 
-P-A-G-E-244
  234 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
principles the encouragement of this sort of work. In- 
deed it plans to get all into some activity. The Wo- 
man’s Activities Association and the Y.W.C.A. each 
has a committee to aid these girls in finding themselves 
socially.’’ 
It is encouraging to learn that there are particular 
colleges and universities in both the Hast and the West 
where deans and officers of students’ organizations are 
seeking to find ways of drawing the self-sufficient girl 
into group activities. But it would be too much to say 
that in general the problem is intelligently attacked 
or even clearly apprehended. Of the forty-six replies 
to the questionnaire received, eight made a negative 
reply to Question II. One writer, after stating that 
no organized plan existed, added rather amusingly, ‘‘I 
fear this is where sororities in general fail to see their 
opportunities.’’ 
Organized Community Work.—The third and fifth 
questions in the questionnaire had reference to the 
means employed ‘‘to bring young women into contact 
with the problems and needs of the community and to 
furnish opportunities for active codperation and ser- 
vice.’’ The fourth question had to do with the exist- 
ence of clubs for the political education of young 
women. These three questions may be considered to- 
gether. Of the forty-six institutions replying to the 
questionnaire, nine mention the Intercollegiate Com- 
munity Service Association as having the definite ob- 
ject of interesting students in community work. This 
Association was organized during the World War ‘‘to 
aid the college alumnex of the country to wider and 
more effective service in their own communities and in 
the European need of the moment.’’ Chapters of the
-P-A-G-E-245
  THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 235 
Association have been organized in several of the 
women’s colleges and in the lfberal arts colleges of 
the coeducational universities, each chapter adopting a 
constitution of its own. A study of the community is 
undertaken to learn its needs and attempts are made 
to interest college women in the work of the organi- 
zation through public meetings, chapter and cabinet 
meetings, interrelation with chapters in other col- 
leges and with the departments of economics and so- 
ciology in the colleges themselves. The Association 
is not religious in character and thus it appeals to many 
young women who are not interested in or who would 
be barred from membership in the Y.W.C.A. Within 
the last two years a large part of the social service 
work at Wellesley, Mt. Holyoke, Smith, Barnard, Vas- 
sar, and Bryn Mawr is maintained by this Associa- 
tion. 
The Social Service Committee of the Y.W.C.A. 
is also making well-planned efforts to arouse young 
women to active interest in some phase of community 
work. Twenty-eight of the forty-six replies contain 
specific mention of the Y.W.C.A. as one of the out- 
standing organizations in the practical social train- 
ing of college girls. Other agencies mentioned once 
or more are the Bureau of Vocational Opportunities, 
the Red Cross Committee, a series of lectures by visit- 
ing lecturers, the Epworth League and other church 
organizations, Current Events Club, the organized 
field work of the departments of Economics and Soci- 
ology, the Child Welfare Council, Eight Weeks Clubs, 
Community or Social Service Clubs, Sociology Club, 
the Home Economics Department which, in one univer-

-P-A-G-E-246
  236 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
sity, ‘‘is working out some interesting experiments 
along social lines’’ and ‘‘strong rural courses empha- 
sizing community service.’’ 
It will be noted that, of these agencies, at least two 
—the Current Events Club and the lecture courses— 
do not provide for practical work. Moreover the work 
of church organizations is almost wholly outside the 
college; and the influence of the economics, sociology, 
and home economics courses probably does not extend 
beyond the students enrolled in those departments. 
Nevertheless it is clear that, in a considerable num- 
ber of colleges and universities, some attempt is made 
to interest women students in community or welfare 
work. One influential western university states that 
its students support ‘‘a public health worker in 
China’’; and a leading woman’s college refers to the 
fact that its students ‘‘support a chair in Ginling Col- 
lege, and have certain other educational and philan- 
thropic responsibilities. . . .”’ An eastern university 
mentions with pride six practical courses in sociology, 
all of which are ‘‘in close touch with civic organiza- 
tions and all use the city as a laboratory’’; and a New 
England college refers to the ‘‘regular social work in 
adjoining factory towns’’ carried on by its students. 
Perhaps the most interesting organization for the 
social training of women mentioned in the replies is 
the Service League of the Connecticut College for 
Women. The League is a student organization which 
seeks ‘‘to unite its members by bonds of friendship 
and loyalty and to inspire them to give their sympathy 
and to dedicate their services to the advancement of 
college interests, community welfare, and national 
and international causes destined to benefit humanity.’’
-P-A-G-E-247
THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 237 
The work of the League is in charge of a Fellow in 
the Sociology department who is recommended by that 
department in which she actively works. The fellow- 
ship is created and maintained by the Service League 
and is endorsed by the Trustees of the college. In 
Connecticut College the sociology department ‘‘is ac- 
tively interested in creating a laboratory for re- 
search work in so-called ‘Americanization’ problems’’; 
and the League strives to aid its efforts by making the 
college an Americanization center from which is sent 
out each year a trained Americanization worker. With- 
in the campus the work of the League is organized 
under committees whose names clearly indicate their 
work: e.g., maids’ committee, student employment, 
book-exchange, lost and found, ete. The extra-campus 
services of the League are organized under committees 
the chairmen, of which are major students in sociology 
who carry on this work as field work. To quote in 
full from the detailed reply to the questionnaire: 
“Off-campus service takes the form of stimulating and organizing 
any work that will tend to bring together and interpret to each other 
the racial groups in the city. The two outstanding phases of this 
work are Mothers’ Clubs and Children’s Movies. 
“Monthly meetings have been held in a public school for foreign 
mothers—lectures, entertainment and refreshments being offered. 
Out of this grew an Inter-racial Handicraft Exhibit, held in codpera- 
tion with a community committee. On the opening day, an Inter- 
racial program was given in honor of New London’s two hundred 
and seventy-fourth birthday. Eleven foreign groups offered en- 
tertainment and over seven hundred people attended the per- 
formance. The Folk Handicraft was exhibited for three days in 
the Court House, over one thousand articles were contributed and 
the visitors represented all elements of the community. 
“The effort to bring the children of foreign and American parents 
together for the purpose of diverting their interests from unwhole-

238 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
some movies is a serious problem in a community whose chief recrea- 
tional interest is the well-known adult performances of ‘thriller’ 
serials. | 
“The Sociology students made a preliminary survey of the atten- 
dance of children at the performances of the local theatres. Hach 
student has been in charge of one of the monthly performances of the 
Children’s Pleasure House. They have succeeded in securing and reg- 
istering at the office for future use, a body of material dealing with 
the efforts throughout the country to improve picture life for children. 
“The Children’s Pleasure House has shown the following films: 
Cinderella, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, Snow White, Tom Saw- 
yer, Seven Swans, and Huck and Tom. The performances have taken 
on the aspect of informal parties, the audiences spontaneously re- 
sponding to creative stimuli as they appear during the supervised 
play in the school yard for early comers and the community singing 
between the reels. Community spirit and codperation is probably 
best illustrated by the offer of music by a children’s orchestra 
directed by a self-termed ‘executive’ of twelve years. The applause 
of the five or six hundred children that greets the dwarfs at the mo- 
ment they save Snow White from the poisoned comb far exceeds any 
even given the Mid-Night Man when he rescues Helen Holmes from 
the lion’s den. The reaction of the audience affords as much pleasure 
to the College girls who act as guardians (there are lawful reasons 
for attendance in that capacity) as the pictures to the children. 
“Not less important than the work of the Sociology department 
in this venture is the codperation of the Art department of the Col- 
lege. The students of this department supply attractive and artistic 
posters which are placed in the public schools advertising each per- 
formance. (Article in Survey, May 15.) 
“Other branches of community work have been a club for factory 
girls, a weekly information bureau for foreigners, mental clinic 
follow-up work. 
“The League is connected with the National Consumers’ League, 
the National Committee for Better Films, Christodora House of New 
York, to whose summer camp the League sends one councillor, and 
the New York Charity Organization Society, to whom one Junior is 
sent on a summer scholarship. 
“The League not only conducts this community program but also 
raises its own budget.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  
THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 239 
Such a thoughtfully planned effort to enlist the 
interest of American college girls in real social prob- 
lems at the same time that they are encouraged to do 
something toward their solution seems decidedly worth 
while. The account of what these young women have 
actually accomplished in linking social knowledge with 
organized social action warms the heart and strength- 
ens the hopes of those educators who deplore the aca- 
demic isolation of our higher centers of learning from 
the common social life. 
Unfortunately such happy unions of theory and 
practice are not numerous. Too often the only agen- 
cies mentioned in the replies to the questionnaire are 
“sociology classes,’’ ‘‘economics classes,’’ ‘‘morning 
talks’’ by the president or dean and visiting lecturers, 
—with no mention of field work. Only two colleges 
bluntly declared that nothing was being done to train 
young women in habits of community codperation. 
But certain other replies indicated little sympathy with 
practical social work on the part of students. One 
dean declared: ‘‘Our students have little time for such 
work’’; another stated that ‘‘We deprecate ‘organized’ 
effort in this work during college years.’’ Still another 
administrator in a middle western college replied with 
apparent regret that the ‘‘Hconomics, Sociology, and 
Home Economics Departments (are) curiously lack- 
ing in this.’’ 
The replies to Question IV concerning the existence 
of clubs for the political education of young women 
were, on the whole, more encouraging. To be sure, 10 
out of the 46 colleges and universities replying, stated 
that no such clubs had been organized and one college 
reported that a citizenship class was planned ‘‘for next  
-P-A-G-E-250
  ' ‘| 240 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
year.’’ But of the remaining se institutions all had 
instituted one or more clubs and classes for the politi- 
eal education of girls. Doubtless the passage of the 
Nineteenth Amendment will shortly bear fruit in well- 
planned efforts to instruct our newly enfranchised 
women in the problems of government in those colleges 
still ignoring this need. 
Training in Leadership—Question VI of the ques- 
tionnaire had reference to the opportunities for lead- 
ership afforded young women in colleges or univer- 
sities under consideration. Almost without exception 
the replies indicated that, through the various college 
organizations,—athletic, student government, social, 
political, religious,—the women students had been 
offered ‘‘ample opportunities’’ for developing initia- 
tive and leadership. Frequent reference is also made 
to the fact that the ‘‘point pyia makes it impos- 
sible for a young woman to hold more than one major 
office in student activities; thus the opportunities for 
active leadership are increased. Likewise the smaller 
colleges stress the fact that, because of their limited 
numbers, a large proportion of their women students 
are called upon for leadership in special,social func- 
tions as well as in student organizations. This, no 
doubt, is true. 
But, despite the rather general complacency which 
the replies reveal, not a few of the writers express a 
greater or less degree of dissatisfaction with the sit- 
uation as its exists in their own college or university. 
One dean writes that ‘‘about 50 per cent. neglect possi- 
ble opportunities that might be utilized’’; another 
states that about 25 per cent. of thé senior class have
-P-A-G-E-251
  
THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 241 
had no training in initiative or leadership. Another 
says that there are ‘‘always some who do not care for 
leadership. Teachers are expected to assume it.’? A 
small college in the West reports that in its senior class 
are three women who are as non-social as when they 
came. ‘‘One is diffident, a second is indifferent and the 
third is individualistic on principle.’? From a well- 
known university comes the report that probably none 
of the women students has lacked opportunity for lead- 
ership. But the Dean of Women adds: ‘‘Perhaps not 
more than half have availed themselves of it.’? An- 
other writer frankly declares: ‘‘Probably two-thirds 
have taken very few responsibilities’’; another esti- 
mates the proportion as two-fifths. An eastern college 
reports: ‘‘About 60 per cent. have, in greater or less 
degree, developed such capacities—that the remaining 
40 per cent. have not is due only in part to lack of 
opportunity.’”’ One reply declares that, ‘‘excluding 
purely social, sorority interests,’’ probably 65 per cent. 
of the women students have failed to develop initiative 
or leadership. Finally, the statement of the Dean of 
Women in a leading state university is well worth 
quoting: ‘‘There is unlimited opportunity for those 
who have initiative. But it is possible for the indi- 
vidual ‘born to blush unseen’ to live on in almost com- 
plete isolation.’’ (Italics mine.) 
On the whole it would seem that college authorities 
have been content to let the problem of developing 
leadership and initiative rest squarely upon the 
shoulders of the student organizations. The prevail- 
ing attitude of faculty and deans seems to be that the 
opportunities for training in these valuable social 
qualities are furnished abundantly enough; if the stu-
-P-A-G-E-252
  242 THE EDUCATION oF WOMEN 
dents fail to avail themselves of their opportunities it 
is no one’s fault but their own. 
There is another aspect of this matter of student 
leadership that should not be ignored. The writer’s 
experience, and that of every Dean of Women with 
whom she has discussed the question, is to the effect 
that a relatively small proportion of young women 
who serve on committees or faithfully attend the meet- 
ings of the Student Government Association ever 
have a chance to assume real responsibility. This is 
too frequently taken over by the chairmen of the stu- 
dent organizations and the officers of the Self-Gov- 
ernment Association. Students have been heard to 
say that they will waste no more time at mass meet- 
ings, since all direction is in the hands of the few 
leaders and they are simply called together to ap- 
prove policies already decided upon. One Dean of 
‘Women, replying to the questionnaire, stated that after 
making a canvass of the women students in the uni- 
versity to ascertain the number in the various or- 
ganizations she found that the offices were held by 
6 per cent. of the students. A further inquiry might 
have shown that this percentage included committee 
members rarely called together and even more rarely 
given opportunities to initiate plans or share in the 
work of executing them. However, it is only fair to 
say that the so-called ‘‘point system’’ is specifically 
designed to increase opportunities for leadership by 
prohibiting any young woman from holding more than 
one major office in student activities. Whether the 
system is generally adopted or whether it accom- 
. its end when it is adopted are fair questions. 
Certain replies seem to indicate an unsatisfactory con-  
-P-A-G-E-253
  
THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 243 
dition in this regard. Thus one dean reported with 
considerable pride that, by the adoption of the point 
system, 25 per cent. of the senior class exercised some 
degree of leadership—quite ignoring the 75 per cent. 
who had been content to follow with various degrees 
of interest or indifference. Would not an investiga- 
tion of this matter disclose a small inner clique of real 
leaders in every women’s college or university—a 
group endowed with executive capacity of a high order 
which will always find opportunities to express itself 
in a variety of social situations? American colleges 
are by no means lacking in girls with records like the 
following, described in the New York Times: + 
  
“Miss is an all-round athlete and prominent in many col- 
lege activities. She is proficient in basketball, baseball, tennis, and 
hockey, and is fond of hiking and camping. Since her freshman 
year she has been song leader of her class and this year is college 
song leader. She is senior House Chairman of one of the largest 
off-campus residence halls and a member of the advisory council 
of the Students’ League. She is also prominent in Y.W.C.A. work, 
being leader of one of the Bible classes for freshmen. For four 
years she has sung in the college choir. Her academic interests are 
centered in economics and biology, and to gain practical experience 
she’worked last summer in a textile factory. . . .” 
This young woman and others like her need little 
stimulus to develop their capacity for leadership. 
They can safely be left to take care of themselves in 
the ordinary college environment. But what shall be 
said of the majority of girls not gifted to frame plans 
and policies and help to carry them through? If this 
group receives no intelligent, constructive help it is 
difficult to see how they can hope to meet effectively

  244 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
the new responsibilities laid upon them by their full 
rights of citizenship. 
Unsocialized Students——The last question in the 
questionnaire was framed to discover whether the 
college had failed to draw any considerable number 
of the last graduating class (1920) into group activi- 
ties or to give them a dynamic interest in public af- 
fairs. Of the forty-three answers to this query twenty- 
two, or slightly over 50 per cent., were in the nega- 
tive. The writers seemed firmly convinced in most 
instances that their out-going seniors had been thor- 
a socialized during the four years of their college 
ife. 
Not so encouraging, however, were the answers re- 
ceived from sixteen colleges and universities. Five 
replies acknowledged a proportion of failures without 
qualification. One Dean of Women, widely known for 
her active interest in progressive social movements, 
frankly replied: ‘‘Yes, not only probable but certain.’’ 
Another answered: ‘‘Yes, but the fault frequently is 
theirs for they refuse to be drawn.’’ Still another 
Dean of Women wrote: ‘‘I fear 50 per cent. of the 
Senior Class will be of this type. They have had 
opportunity to get interested but are not.’’ This reply 
is almost unique in revealing some dissatisfaction with 
the methods employed to awaken social interest, for it 
concludes: ‘‘The right appeal has not been made.’’ In 
a large western university the plan was tried of invit- 
ing each woman of the senior ciass to ‘‘sign up’’ indi- 
cating what activity she would like to promote. The 
records showed that about 50 per cent. of the senior 
women ‘‘signed up,’’ and this is probably a high pro- 
portion as colleges go. The dean of one of our oldest  
-P-A-G-E-255
  THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 245 
women’s colleges declares that it ‘‘is probable that in 
every senior class there is quite a group that has not 
been aroused to interest in community and national 
questions.’’? Another reply states that there ‘‘are 
always a considerable number from each class that do 
not form group relationships, but it is doubtful if more 
opportunities would change the situation.’? The 
president of the student government organization in 
a well-known state university writes: ‘‘It is still en- 
tirely true that a considerable number of young women 
will leave the University without having been success- 
fully drawn into group relationships, but we have de- 
cided that it is exceedingly difficult to change entirely 
in four years habits which have been in the making 
for a much longer time.’’ 
In two instances the replies indicated that, whereas 
very few seniors had not taken some active part in 
student organizations, a considerable proportion of 
the class were indifferent to public issues. Thus one 
Dean of Women writes: ‘‘I am sorry to say that I see 
no serious interest in community and national ques- 
tions on the part of our students as a body. Many 
individuals are interested and enlightened, but rela- 
tively they are few.’’ Another dean declares that 
“comparatively few girls have a real interest in na- 
tional questions. I should say not more than one- 
third.’’ Finally an ironic reply from a coeducational 
college is worth quoting: ‘‘There are—fortunately— 
a few born specialists in the class whose interests are 
‘predominantly intellectual’—a larger number whose 
interests are predominantly romantic and domestic; 
but the majority of our young women are awake to 
community and national questions.’’  
-P-A-G-E-256
246 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
Summary and Conclusions—It has seemed worth 
while to quote in some detail from the replies received 
to the questionnaire because they not only bring out 
contemporary conditions and trends in higher educa- 
tion with respect to the civic training of women, 
but they make manifest the prevailing attitude toward 
this question. The conclusion seems inevitable that 
a majority of college administrators are content with 
the means now offered for training girls in social 
responsibility and are prone to conclude that the 
students who fail to use their chances have only 
themselves to blame. If a young woman leaves col- 
lege as individualistic or as indifferent to social prob- 
lems and needs as when she entered, it is not because 
she hasn’t been ‘exposed’ to a variety of opportuni- 
ties to remedy her defects. Obviously no such attitude 
would be taken by college officers if a young woman’s 
intellectual capacities fell below the standard. In 
such a case she would be summoned to the office of the 
Dean of Women, or of her academic advisor, in order 
that the difficulty might be clearly understood and 
dealt with. The student’s deficiencies would constitute 
a problem and a challenge, not a condition to be more 
or less supinely accepted. Plans would be formulated 
for giving her special assistance in meeting her in- 
tellectual difficulties, either by way of helping her to 
work out more intelligent methods of study or of 
giving her the basic information which she lacks. Not 
until these plans had proved unsuccessful would pro- 
fessors and administrative officers give up the girl as 
hopeless; but in that case she would be denied the 
coveted bachelor’s degree. When college authorities 
“‘see life steadily and see it whole’’ they will attach

an importance to the development of the social capa- 
cities of women approximate to that which they accord 
to the training of intellectual abilities. 
In the light of history it can scarcely be denied 
that higher education in the past has tended to re- 
sult in personal culture rather than in socialized be- 
havior. And until studies in government, sociology, 
and economics are linked with the activities of individ- 
uals in community life ‘‘the actual behavior of pupil- 
citizens in civic affairs’’ will, in most instances, be 
little affected by those studies. 
Civic Epucation or Girts in Hico ScHoois 
Until very recent years the high school in America 
has suffered from the same historic malady as the 
college—it has regarded its function as the imparting 
of information, with the dual aim of giving students a 
‘‘oeneral education’? and of preparing a select minor- 
ity for college. Not only has very little been done to 
link the high school with the community but even the 
‘“Cacademic’’ study of social institutions and problems 
has been grossly neglected. Writing in 1918, Pro- 
fessor Inglis charged that in ‘‘many secondary schools 
at the present time it is possible for pupils to pass 
through the entire course without coming into contact 
with the social sciences.’? The high school, even 
more than the college, has failed to capitalize at their 
full value the social interests and impulses always 
generated where adolescent youths are regularly 
brought into association. And because educators have 
ignored this fact students have taken the matter into 
1Inglis, Principles of Secondary Education, p. 569. 
   
-P-A-G-E-258
  248 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
their own hands and have sponsored a variety of 
clubs and organizations—some within, some without 
the school—which have frequently interfered more or 
less seriously with school work and, in not a few in- 
stances, have had a purely frivolous purpose. ‘‘This 
situation,’’ writes Stout, ‘constitutes a very practical 
problem which thrusts itself upon the school and 
which the school is wholly unable to grapple with in 
the absence of a proper social organization of its own. 
These social functions may be harmless enough in 
themselves. But the frequency with which they occur 
and the late hours incident to them and the absence 
of direction and control, render them hindrances to 
the work of the school; and they too frequently have a 
demoralizing influence upon the young people them- 
selves.’’ + 
The waste of the social interest and energy of girls 
in a round of meetings of Greek letter societies and 
so-called literary clubs appears the more deplorable 
when we recall the splendid public services of Ameri- 
can girls during the World War. Their capacity for 
wider social vision, for self-forgetful service, and un- 
stinted expenditure of energy for the common good 
were then abundantly demonstrated. ‘‘The war-time 
call was one for enlistment—enlistment by girls with 
girls’’ and loyally did the girls rise to meet it. The 
work of girls’ clubs in the Red Cross, in selling Lib- 
erty Bonds, in the food conservation movement, in 
adopting and clothing French orphans, in protective 
work for girls living near army camps was a magnifi- 
cent refutation of the charge of certain carping Mrs. 
Grundys that the modern girl is a selfish, pleasure-

seeking individualist who has impatiently thrown off 
most of the social restraints of her mother’s genera- 
tion, while she denies the validity of its religious 
sanctions. 
Since the armistice this precious fund of public 
spirit has been allowed largely to go to waste. It is 
a mournful truism that human nature often reveals 
its finest social loyalties, its noblest capacities in behalf 
of the common welfare under the stress of war. Hdu- 
cators to-day are squarely confronted with the problem 
of how to kindle, in piping times of peace, dynamic 
social impulses in boys and girls and harness them 
to the service of the community and the nation. 
During the past few years the leaders of educa- 
tional thought have shown signs of awakening to the 
mistake involved in the neglect of the social educa- 
tion of adolescents. This awakening is shown in the 
prevalent tendency to criticise the teaching of civics 
as too formal and too much concerned with the ma- 
chinery of local, state, and national government. The 
view vigorously expressed by Inglis is becoming 
widespread: 
“The mere attainment of a knowledge of our social-civie organiza- 
tion or even the development in the pupil of a sense of civi¢ re- 
sponsibility and ideals of civic conduct is not sufficient. Unless such 
knowledge, such a sense of social responsibility, such civie ideals, 
are translated into forms of behavior and result in proper civic 
action, the values of the study of civics cannot be attained. Here, 
more than in the case of most studies in the secondary school, direct 
values are dominant and no accumulation of information concerning 
the function of government or the relation of the individual to gov- 
ernment can take the place of the development of social attitudes 
and tendencies to act.”* 
1 Principles of Secondary Education, pp. 560-61. 
     
-P-A-G-E-260
250 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
Such promising evidence that the principles of be- 
lavioristic psychology are at last being applied to 
teaching civics is strengthened by the Report of the 
Committee on Social Studies of the Commission on the 
Reorganization of Secondary Education. This valu- 
able Report,! after emphasizing the importance of 
‘““community civics’? as most closely related to the 
experience of every child-citizen, defines the purpose 
of such study as follows: 
“The aim of community civies is to help the child to know his 
community—not merely a lot of facts about it, but the meaning of 
his community life, what it does for him, and how it does it, what 
the community has a right to expect from him, and how he may 
fulfil his obligations—meanwhile cultivating in him the essential 
qualities and habits of good citizenship.” * 
Furthermore the Committee on Social Studies cor- 
dially recommends the study of ‘‘Problems of Ameri- 
can Democracy, Economic, Social, Political.’? It de- 
clares that such a subject should be the ‘‘culminating 
course of social study in the last year of the high 
school, with the purpose of giving a more definite, 
comprehensive and deeper knowledge of some of the 
vital problems of social life and thus of securing a 
more intelligent and active citizenship.’? It is en- 
couraging to note that the Committee favors such 
methods of teaching this subject as will ensure to 
every student ‘‘experience and practice in the ob- 
servation of social phenomena as he encounters them; 
that he should be brought to understand that every 
social problem is many-sided and complex; and that 
he should acquire the habit of dispassionate consid- 
eration of all the facts available.’’ Finally the Com- 
1See Bureau a Education Bulletin No. 28, 1916. 
7 Op. cit., pp.
-P-A-G-E-261
THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 251 
mittee registers its belief that these results ‘‘can best 
be accomplished by dealing with actual situations as 
they occur and by drafting into service the materials 
of all the social sciences as occasion demands for a 
thorough understanding of the situations in ques- 
tion?” 2 
The Committee’s heart-whole abandonment of the 
prevailing logical and theoretical presentations of 
civics in favor of an empirical study may be taken 
as a hopeful index of a general change in theory as 
regards the teaching of this vital subject. And signs 
are not lacking that here and there, throughout the 
country, public-school teachers and administrators 
are putting their new ideas into practice. City sys- 
tem after city system has set to work to revise its 
course in civics or social sciences so as to bring the 
work closer to the actual problems and activities of 
community living. The new Syllabus for first year 
high school civics in New York City begins with the 
consideration of such every day questions as The 
City’s Water Supply, Guarding the Health of the 
People, Protecting the Food of the City, The Problem 
of Housing, ete. The Syllabus also favors judicious 
visits to public buildings and questioning of such offi- 
cials as are not too busy, use of ‘‘laboratory mate- 
rial,’’ such as bills and resolutions of the Assembly, 
and Minutes of the Board of Aldermen, study of news- 
papers, and use of filing cabinets and bulletin boards. 
On the whole, however, although the new plan for 
teaching civics in our metropolitan city is a vast im- 
provement over the old, there is much room yet for 
the courageous adoption of genuine field work, how-

-P-A-G-E-262
  252 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
ever difficult this may be. The same may be said for 
the courses in civics, economics and social problems in 
other high school systems. Although the tendency is 
to lay emphasis ‘‘first on the political and social prob- 
lems of the city, leading to the broader state and na- 
tional questions,’’ and to encourage visits to local 
institutions and industries, the courses of study 
still show clear traces of the older methods of logi- 
cal arrangement of subject matter obtained from 
books. 
A League for Civic Education.—One of the most 
promising experiments for the education of girls and 
boys in habits of good citizenship is the Junior Civic 
and Industrial League established in 1914 in connec- 
tion with the public schools of Lincoln, Nebraska. 
This League developed out of a series of conferences 
held between the Superintendent of Schools and the 
Secretary of the Commercial Club of Lincoln—confer- 
ences which ‘‘established the fact that a strong senti- 
ment existed among the business men of the city 
favorable to the formation of some definite plan 
whereby the schools and the business men should co- 
operate in making it more easy for the boys and 
girls to become familiar with the industrial and 
civic life of the community. A plan was adopted pro- 
viding for an organization of boys in the fifth grade 
and above to be sponsored jointly by the Commercial 
Club and the schools and to be made up of clubs from 
each school. The purely civic purposes of the League, 
as set forth in its publication, The Junior Citizen, were 
declared to be as follows: 
“1. To study the civic and industrial life of the city by first hand 
observation.
-P-A-G-E-263
THE SOCIAL EDUCATION OF WOMEN 258 
2. To connect more closely the work of the public schools with the 
life of the community. 
3. To teach its members to aid effectively in meeting the civic needs 
of the community and to assist every civic institution in pro- 
moting the general welfare of our city.” * 
Shortly after the boys’ league was instituted a simi- 
lar organization for girls was established. In 1917-18 
a census of the Junior Civie League showed that 1,053 
boys and 935 girls were members. 
Needless to say the new and valuable features of this 
plan are first, the codperation of the Commercial Club, 
composed as it is of business men who can command 
opportunities for opening up the resources and the 
machinery of the city to its girls and boys; and second, 
the strong emphasis placed on civic projects, on 
actually doing something to promote the city’s welfare. 
Three large projects were carried out during the school 
year 1917-18: (1) the securing of 10,136 signatures to 
the membership cards of the United States Food Ad- 
ministration, (2) gathering data about 962 acres of 
back yards and vacant lots available for gardening, 
(3) a city-wide campaign to exterminate the Tussock 
moth.? 
From time to time efficiency certificates are awarded 
by the Commercial Club ‘‘to those members whose 
character, habits, and scholarship entitled them to 
special recognition.’’ Here again, the active and con- 
tinuous interest of the business men of the city in the 
civic training of its youth—girls as well as boys—is 
conspicuous and almost unique. Unquestionably this 
sympathetic relation existing between a club of promi-

nent citizens and the Junior Civic League imparts a 
vitality and significance to the plans and efforts of the 
girls and boys which are keenly felt by them. The 
success of the scheme suggests the advisability of try- 
ing it out in other cities where the study of community 
civics still remains too bookish and removed from 
everyday civic concerns. 
A Study by the North Central Association.—In 1919- 
20 the North Central Association, through its Commis- 
sion on Secondary Schools, sent out a questionnaire to 
each high school accredited by the association in order 
to discover ‘‘precisely what practices are being carried 
on in the secondary schools of the land with the direct 
intent of developing qualities of citizenship among the 
students enrolled in those schools... .’? The four 
main divisions of the study were:   “A. Provisions for arousing desirable sentiments of citizenship. 
B. Provisions for furnishing information relating to the privileges 
and duties of citizenship. 
C. Provisions for securing from pupils active participation in 
affairs that tend to develop habits of spontaneous, and also 
studied, responses that make for good citizenship. 
D. Expressions of the personal views of principals regarding 
certain specific policies.” * 
A preliminary report was presented at the annual 
meeting of Secondary School Principals in Cleveland, 
Ohio, February 23, 1920. Questionnaires were re- 
turned from 1,180 schools distributed over 18 states. 
The returns showed that the provisions for exciting 
sentiments of citizenship included assembly talks, 
patriotic music, oral and prescribed readings, dramati- 
zation (only 398 schools), pageantry (353), moving

pictures (290), stereopticons (438), teaching of litera- 
ture (1,030), excursions (495). The provisions for pro- 
viding information respecting citizenship included the 
teaching of civics (1,148 schools), elementary sociology 
(298), elementary economics (696), current events 
(1,008), ‘‘morals, manners, and life problems’’ (112), 
occupations (194), history, taught with the end of 
making ‘‘every boy and girl believe and understand the 
worth of being free’ (1,057), biography (1,012), prob- 
lems of labor and capital (assembly talks, debates, 
current events or class work, 1,193), wholesome use of 
leisure (athletics, talks, readings, supervision of stu- 
dent affairs, student clubs, 1,015). 
Most suggestive were the replies to Division C which 
concerned itself with the question of the active partici- 
pation of pupils in civic affairs that tend to develop 
habits of good citizenship. A table summarizing the 
replies follows: 1

wholesome organizations and activities as the Junior 
Red Cross, the Boy and Girl Scouts, debating clubs, 
school papers, and mock elections. Not so encourag- 
ing, however, are the returns in regard to other 
organizations. It is surely no cause for congratulation 
that of 1,180 high schools reporting only 76 should 
have established good citizenship leagues, even though 
672 principals went on record as in favor of organizing 
Junior Civic Leagues. Nor is there occasion for pride 
in the fact that only 373 schools reported the estab- 
lishment of community centers and only 306 the 
organization of student self-government. It is a strik- 
ing commentary on the views of American educators 
concerning thekind of education suitable in a democ- 
racy and for a democracy that more than two-thirds of 
the 1,180 high schools under consideration still govern 
girls and boys from fourteen to eighteen years of age 
by authority imposed from above. It is more than 
probable that a similar study of the secondary schools 
in the Hast and South would reveal an even higher 
proportion in which student self-government is an 
empty name. 
Civic Trarntne In Grris’ TrapE anp INDUSTRIAL 
ScHooLs 
Up to the present time the number of trade and 
industrial schools for girls established in this country 
is very small. A request for information sent to a 
dozen of the more prominent of these schools in 
different parts of the country brought replies that 
made abundantly plain the fact that most trade 
schools give no time at all (if their announcements 
may be trusted) to the task of developing in work-
-P-A-G-E-267

ing girls civic interests and knowledge or of train- 
ing them to take an active part in community affairs. 
It is as if the managers and teachers in these schools 
regarded their duty as solely a preparation of their 
students to earn their living in a semi-skilled or skilled 
employment with a minimum expenditure of time. 
Such a viewpoint ignores completely the fact that the 
life of the humblest citizen is not wholly circumscribed 
by his or her daily work, but normally includes inter- 
ests and activities centering about the family, the 
social group, and the state. No woman lives by work 
alone; and to restrict her education, after the age of 
fourteen, wholly to specialized occupational training is 
to regard her as a working machine. 
A few exceptions to the general attitude of indiffer- 
ence to the civic education of working girls should be 
noted. The Boston Trade School devotes tivo and one- 
half hours weekly to so-called ‘‘related work’’ or 
‘‘general work.’’ Included in these studies are courses 
in home nursing and community civics. Likewise the 
North Bennet Street Industrial School of Boston, in its 
prevocational classes for girls, includes work in civics 
and current events which are thus described in detail: 
“Civics: Citizenship, naturalization, voting, duties of the individ- 
ual to the community, city government. 
“Current events: (Much of our history leads back from the present 
into the past.) Present federal administration as a starter tracing 
back thru the years to revolutionary days.” 
This is surely good as far as it goes, although there 
is no indication that ‘‘the duties of the individual to 
the community’’ are taught in connection with practi- 
cal social work. However, one of the most useful 
Services of the school is carried on through the Social

Service House, a neighborhood settlement with a mem- 
bership of 447 persons organized into 26 clubs. This 
represents an attempt to organize community effort in 
a section of the old North End of Boston inhabited by a 
high proportion of the foreign born. 
The Manhattan Trade School of New York offers 
two courses to every one of the approximately eight 
hundred girls enrolled in the school at any one time. 
The first course is in ‘‘Citizenship’’ and is allowed the 
equivalent of two hours weekly for one term; the sec- 
ond is a course in ‘‘Labor Laws’’ to which about the 
same amount of time is allotted. In the citizenship 
class such topics as the following are discussed: the 
meaning and responsibilities of citizenship; how citi- 
zenship is obtained; persons not eligible; naturaliza- 
tion; how United States citizenship may be lost; the 
need for government; government of the United 
States; state and local government; political parties 
and the nature of political issues. In the other course 
the labor legislation of the United States and the State 
of New York receive attention, especially that relating 
to factory inspection, the child labor laws, the laws 
relating to women’s labor, and laws concerning sanita- 
tion, fire protection, and accident prevention. Both 
these courses are taught with constant reference to the 
needs of girls in trades and industry and, so taught, 
should prove of very real value in the girls’ daily 
working lives. 
The Philadelphia Trade School for Girls, taken over 
from private agencies in 1918 and ably administered 
for several years by Miss Cleo Murtland, offers, appar- 
ently, a rather thorough and carefully planned course 
in ‘‘Civies and Business Relationships.’’ The Report

of this school for the year ending December 31, 1918,

Civies, more than any other subject taught in the schools, deals 
with present-day immediate affairs and it is live and useful in pro- 
portion to its connection with daily life and happenings. The course 
outlined here indicates a method of selection of subjects to be con- 
sidered in a course of civics for young working girls. The outline 
is/intended for the teacher’s use only and is intended to serve as a 
gnide in the selection of topics and interpretations to be made. 
The subject is most successfully taught by the discussion method, 
which encourages the discovery and study of the important points in 
any given topic. The pupils’ opinions on such topies as compulsory 
education, child-labor laws, traffic regulations, the water supply, 
street cleaning, and the like, gives the teacher an opportunity to 
direct thought into right channels and to increase individual sense 
of responsibility. 
The underlying principles of government that by its regulations 
insures the greatest good to the greatest number, that laws are 
made to protect, not to punish, unless the person punished has trans- 
gressed and so interfered with the comfort and freedom of others 
should take precedence over the mechanics of organization. The 
fundamentals or organizations, selection and election of officials can 
be taught in connection with the school council. With this back- 
ground some of the more remote phases of election and government 
organization—local, state, and national—may be taught.

  260 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
The first two copies in the outline (Compulsory Education Law 
and Child Labor Law) have proved of great value in introducing 
the subject of civics to girls about to enter wage-earning careers 
because of their close connection with her school and working 
career. The order of topics is not significant, but in teaching it is 
important that subjects be presented in the order of their interest 
to the pupils. 
There follows a detailed outline of the course which, 
if it is intelligently carried out, represents a hopeful 
beginning, not alone in recognizing the importance of 
civic enlightenment of working girls, but also in pro- 
viding a course which is at once liberalizing and in 
close connection with the affairs of every day life. 
Much remains to be done, however, before trade 
schools for girls, as well as high schools and colleges, 
are prepared seriously to attack the question of train- 
ing girls to be intelligent and active citizens. The 
trade school of to-day has to meet a special difficulty 
which the higher schools are spared—that of justifying 
to the girls and their parents every subject that is 
taught as of immediate practical value to the student. 
With the restricted outlook upon life of these workers, 
courses in hygiene, home-making and civics too often 
seem unimportant, having little relation to the busi- 
ness of earning a living. Thus the trade school errs in 
precisely the opposite way from the high school and 
college: the former applies so narrow a standard of 
utility to school studies that it would exclude nearly 
all but those immediately concerned in developing 
technical skills having a wage value; whereas the 
woman’s college, cloistered in the midst of its trees 
and shadowy paths, too often makes only ‘‘theoretical 
sallies into the world outside’’ and is fairly content 
that the walls of the campus should bound for the

  CHAPTER VIII 
MANNERS AND MORALS 
The Insurgent Girl.—In the previous chapter the 
term ‘‘social education’’ has been interpreted in its 
broader meaning as a preparation for civic usefulness. 
But, obviously, in a more restricted sense it has to do 
with training to meet the social situations naturally 
developing out of social intercourse. Those who have 
had much to do with the education of adolescent girls 
well know that one most pressing problem is how to 
utilize the social feeling always generated where young 
people are brought together in such a way as to de- 
velop in them worthy standards of manners and mor- 
als. The question is rendered peculiarly difficult at the 
present time by the fact that social standards, accepted 
unquestioningly less than two decades ago, are them- 
selves undergoing radical change. Add to this the 
fact that the young people of the twentieth century 
appear to some of their elders as unruly mutineers, 
wilfully opposed to the observance of any standards 
other than those dictated by their individual caprices, 
and the problem is seen to be involved and delicate. 
Current literature abounds in descriptions of the in- 
surgent young woman of to-day, who turns her back 
with entire self-assurance on the mid-Victorian stand- 
ards of her grandmother and asserts her inalienable 
right to frame her own ideals of conduct and abide by 
262
-P-A-G-E-273
  MANNERS AND MORALS 268 
their consequences. The opposition between the old 
order and the new, between sedate middle age and 
rebellious youth, is convincingly set forth in a series of 
contemporary articles in the Atlantic Monthly. The 
opening gun is fired by ‘‘Mr. Grundy’’ who seeks to 
discover where the responsibility lies for the ‘‘supply 
of ill-bred young hoydens whose well-aimed blows give 
Society its black eye... .’? Very wisely, it would 
seem, he decides that ‘‘fathers, mothers, sons, and 
daughters are all found guilty, though in different de- 
grees; ...’’? Therefore he urges fathers to reason 
with their daughters, even exercising patriarchal 
authority, if they must; while he exhorts mothers ‘‘to 
tell their daughters truthfully and simply the effect of 
some phases of their social laxity on the men whose 
moral fibre they are weakening.’’ 1 
In a subsequent article, Mrs. Grundy tends to empha- 
size conditions rather than persons as chiefly responsi- 
ble for the vulgarity and recklessness of a familiar 
type of modern girl. After heaping blame on the 
movie, the war, the ‘‘radical intellectuals,’’ the luxury 
of the nowveaux riches, she reaches the conclusion that 
“the abandonment of religion is probably most respon- 
sible of all, since it bears a causal relation to most of 
those other facts.’’ Because the old religious sanctions 
no longer have great weight, even with adults, because 
our moral standards are no longer rooted in religious 
authority, ‘‘we are all bewildered and do not know just 
where to draw the line. The result of that state of 
mind is to have the line drawn a great deal further 
along than anyone expected.’’ ?

Atlantic Monthly, August, 1920. 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  264 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
Possibly Mrs. Gerould is right, at least in part, in 
her diagnosis of a modern malady; but the feasibility 
of restoring what she is pleased to call ‘‘definite reli- 
gion’’ seems doubtful. Meanwhile ‘‘A Last Year’s 
Debutante’’ assures us that society ‘‘isn’t rotten—it 
only looks so and . . . all these sensational bids for 
popularity, which we [i.e., rebellious young people] 
have borrowed for a little while from the variety stage 
and which have been dragged into the limelight by our 
virtuous critics, are not the signs of social degenera- 
tion, but the inevitable result of a revolution that is 
being waged everywhere.’’? This breezy young woman 
declares with much truth that youth has been hood- 
winked about many things by its elders and now it 
‘‘wants to find things out at first-hand.’’ With com- 
plete savoir faire she throws down the gauntlet to Mr. 
Grundy and all his ilk in the words: ‘‘We’d rather be 
wrong in our own way than right in someone else’s, 
and you’ve just got to let us work out our own salva- 
tion, because we don’t believe there is any other 
kind.’’? 
But can deans and advisers of girls, burdened as 
these foster mothers are, with a sense of responsibility 
for the welfare of the young women under their charge, 
lightly cast aside all responsibility at the behest of 
these youthful insurgents and leave them to the heavy 
whacks of Dame Experience? Such a step would be to 
turn our backs upon the time-honored principle that 
plastic, inexperienced youth can learn from the hard- 
earned wisdom of its elders. Yet many a woman in 
college and high school, who finds herself in the posi- 
tion of social guide and moral inspirer of several 
1 Atlantic Monthly, November, 1920,
-P-A-G-E-275
MANNERS AND MORALS 265 
hundred girls, must have seriously raised in her own 
mind the question: how far can my advice, be it ever so 
understanding and sympathetic, really change the atti- 
tudes, standards and habits of life of a girl in her late 
teens or early twenties? To be sure this desired result 
can be and has been accomplished in cases where the 
woman counsellor is big enough and wise enough to 
inspire not alone respect but admiration and cordial 
liking. But the great need of these advisers at present 
is the codperation of intelligent parents. Indeed the 
voice of the social adviser is that of one crying in the 
wilderness unless her efforts are prepared for and 
seconded by the influence and training of a good home. 
At least one dean of women in the Middle West has 
recorded her convictions on this question in no uncer- 
tain tones: 
“For these young barbarians. . . . I do not believe that any satis- 
factory system of control can be gotten by machinery, whether of 
faculty, or of deans, or of sororities, or of what not. Machine work 
is all very well on wood or iron or linen, but it is merely a make- 
shift on young human beings. 
“The control of college social life must begin in the home. And 
as the great Mississippi valley gets older and its people win more 
leisure, there will always be in it more and more homes in which 
boys and girls are carefully trained, in which will be anticipated 
those subtler points on the entrance requirements that are not ex- 
pressed as languages and mathematics. . . . These homes will really 
relieve the university of much of its present social function, at 
least of its responsibility of bringing girls out into society.” * 
Some readers may differ from the writer on the 
question of the mechanical character of existing 
organizations for student control in colleges and co- 
educational universities, but few will take issue with 
1 Breed, “The Control of Student Life,” in Jour. of A.0.A., December, 1908. 
   
-P-A-G-E-276
266 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
her in regard to the supreme importance of the home 
as a shaper of manners and morals—and to its indis- 
pensability. How to train girls in habits of courtesy 
and consideration for everyone—even uninteresting 
persons outside their ‘‘own set’’—and how to develop 
in them standards of conduct that will promote and 
not hinder the happiness and welfare of their fellow- 
beings are questions uppermost in the minds of all 
who have to do with the social education of girls. 
Obviously the matter is tremendously complicated by 
the fact that the girl has been half spoiled by defective 
home training or none at all before she is sent to col- 
lege. Sympathetic personal help, the wholesome in- 
fluence of well-regulated college life and of bodies of 
self-respecting students, these will all be aids in trans- 
forming a lawless hoyden, bent on cramming as much 
doubtful amusement as possible into her college days 
—and nights—into a self-controlled young woman 
with a few serious interests in life. But how much 
can be done in our higher schools to offset the effects 
of misdirected or non-existent home training? This is 
the problem that confronts deans and advisers with 
every week that passes; and it must be admitted that it 
is not always viewed with confident optimism. 
Control of the Social Life of College Women.—The 
social life of most college women is not at all lacking 
in social opportunities which seem all too numerous. 
Moreover, in relatively few instances does the modern 
American girl need encouragement to induce her to 
share in the social life of her school or college. Too 
often she lives in an environment of over-social stimu- 
lation and throws herself into a round of pleasures 
with entire abandon. Most of us will sympathize with 
 
-P-A-G-E-277
  MANNERS AND MORALS 267 
the dean who bewails the current practice of using the 
coeducational university as ‘‘a social stalking ground,”’ 
where teas, dances, movies, and motor parties easily 
push into the background the intellectual activities 
still associated in old-fashioned minds with higher 
education. Likewise another plaint of this guardian of 
youth will meet with cordial response from college 
instructors: ‘‘The new order is very human but it is 
not academic, it is not dignified. It is very excessive.”’ 
In such circumstances the outstanding question is 
one of intelligent control rather than stimulus. But 
this is only to state a fresh problem. As Mr. Clarence 
Birdseye pointed out several years ago the modern 
college or university exercises little or no control over 
ninety-five per cent. of the students’ time. This state 
of affairs the author believes to be necessary under a 
faculty of specialists and research workers. There- 
fore, he argues, the student of to-day receives none of 
that individual training so necessary to develop charac- 
ter. Obviously the situation is even more difficult in 
the coeducational university, where young men and 
women are thrown together in a free social atmosphere 
with the greater part of their time out of class hours 
at their own disposal. It is true that the responsibility 
for wise regulation of this free time is thrown upon 
the burdened shoulders of the dean of women and the 
women members of the faculty. But it is difficult to 
see how the former can minister single-handed to the 
personal needs of hundreds, even thousands, of eager, 
restless, young women; and, although the faculty 
women can do something, if they will, to build up in 
the minds of students saner standards of recreation 
and amusement, they will have to devote to this eru-
-P-A-G-E-278
  268 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
sade hours of energy and thought which many will 
feel should be expended in broadening and deepening 
their scholarship. 
It has been suggested that the wives of members of 
the faculty might render valuable help to the crude- 
mannered, self-conscious, or aggressive girls or to 
those social butterflies who are ever fluttering about 
the flame of ‘‘a good time.’’ And, indeed, ‘‘faculty 
wives’? have not rarely been influential in helping 
young women to a more wholesome use of leisure. 
But such help must, by its very nature, be limited in 
scope since its results are accomplished through sym- 
pathetic individual effort with individual girls, not 
with groups. There are sound sense and experience 
in the following remarks of the dean of women quoted 
above: 
“T am a heretic in these matters, for I do not think that taking 
girls by twenties in our houses and feeding them with cake and tea 
does much for social control. But if it were practicable for every 
girl in the university to be on really familiar terms with the wife 
of some faculty member, so that she had access to the privacy of 
a cultivated home and to the counsel of a cultivated woman, then 
there would be no problem worth discussing about coeducation, the 
Dean of Women might joyfully see herself abolished, and the co- 
educational millennium would dawn. But meanwhile, there is the 
awful fact of numbers.” * 
If, however, we are in optimistic mood most of us 
will agree that the joint efforts of dean, women in- 
structors, and faculty wives may and do accomplish 
worthwhile results in refining manners, in substituting 
other interests for the all-absorbing joys of the theater 
and the dance hall, and above all, in developing in 
young women a distaste for ‘‘the crude familiarities of

Tommy Atkins and his sweetheart’? when they are in 
the society of young men. But college officials cannot 
achieve these ends alone. They must draw heavily 
upon the influences radiating from the saner, more 
serious women students, upon the regular, ordered life 
in university and college, and upon the call of institu- 
tions of learning to high thought and high endeavor. 
The Woman’s Fraternity as a Means of Social Edu- 
cation and Control.—Looming large among student 
organizations are the Greek letter fraternities. Much 
has been said for or against these societies, yet they 
continue to flourish like the green bay tree, especially 
in high schools and state universities. In the women’s 
colleges, on the other hand, their star has been on the 
wane for more than a decade. It is interesting to find 
that Mr. Birdseye, in his effort to find some agency 
that will educate young people in a wiser use of the 
unsupervised time at their disposal, has hit upon the 
fraternity as the ideal instrument to this end. Very 
sensibly he points out that college students need more 
individual attention and training than they can ever 
receive in our larger centers of learning. Therefore 
let them join fraternities and regard the fraternity 
houses as their ‘‘college homes’’ where ‘‘each is to 
pass his college family life, as sacred to him as his 
family life at home....’’ The seniors in these 
‘“homes’’ will do a valuable and much-needed work in 
teaching college manners and traditions to the crude 
under classmen. To quote Mr. Birdseye: 
‘“‘The freshman will be thoroughly broken in by the 
firm but kindly rule of the upper classmen, backed by 
years of wise traditions and customs, which represent 
what has been best in many college generations. ...
-P-A-G-E-280
270 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
These traditions cover what should and should not be 
done and are clean and wise in well-managed chap- 
ters.’’? 
Influential alumni, living in the locality, together 
with the seniors, must be responsible for the moral 
atmosphere of these homes and prevent the wrecking 
of a chapter by a morally weak delegation. An ideal 
fraternity home is, in Mr. Birdseye’s opinion, ‘‘a com- 
mon-sense twentieth century substitute, through a 
close and wise relation of the older college man with 
the undergraduate, to fill the gap left by the elision of 
the parental relation of professor and pupil of the 
Ecclesiastical Period.’’ 
An Investigation of Women’s Fraternities—It is 
obvious enough that Mr. Birdseye’s glowing account 
of the moral value of fraternity life has its source in 
pleasant memories of his own fraternity days. Indeed 
he admits as much. But can so difficult a question as 
the social and moral value of fraternities be solved by 
any other method than that of stringent, wide, and 
impartial investigation? Fortunately, for our pur- 
poses such an investigation was undertaken several 
years ago by Miss Edith Rickert in behalf of the 
Century Magazine. The writer found that in 1910 
two hundred and sixty chapters of Greek letter frater- 
nities for women had been organized in American uni- 
versities and colleges with a membership of nearly fifty 
thousand. She quotes a fraternity woman as declar- 
ing that the purpose of the organization is to complete 
individual development. ‘‘The university endeavors 
to graduate a student—the fraternity a significant, un- 
selfish, gracious woman.’’ With entire impartiality 
1 Individual Training in Our Colleges, p. 307.
-P-A-G-E-281
  MANNERS AND MORALS 271 
Miss Rickert recounts the advantages of such organi- 
zations to the fortunate young women elected to mem- 
bership. They are, briefly, (1) the happy family life 
in fraternity houses led by a group of attractive girls; 
(2) the responsibility of the elder sisters ‘‘for the 
physical, intellectual, and spiritual welfare of the 
younger [who are] bound to heed the precepts and 
follow the examples of the elder’’; (3) the beautiful 
and uplifting character of the ritual which links these 
girls together; (4) the frank, mutual criticism in the 
light of fraternity ideals; (5) the loyal character of 
the friendships; (6) the gracious hospitality of the 
fraternity houses to faculty and distinguished guests, 
a hospitality which educates girls ‘‘to preside and to 
receive with grace and charm, to deal tactfully with 
many temperaments, to shuffle guests, [in short to] 
become skilled in the complete art of the social game.’’ 
According to the claims of its members, a fraternity 
girl ‘‘develops individuality and power to lead; she 
acquires valuable business training and womanly 
charm ... and whatever the lines of service to which 
she may consecrate herself she will always be a 
success.’? 1 
Surely this is an attractive picture and if fraterni- 
ties can accomplish such beneficent results in social 
training perhaps deans and faculties should lend all 
their influence to bring about an increase in the number 
of these sisterhoods. But what is the obverse side of 
fraternity life and influence as shown by Miss Rickert? 
Although fraternity women deny that wealth, good 
looks, style, and family standing play important réles 
in determining a girl’s fitness to ‘‘make a frat,’’ yet 
2 Century Magazine, 63: 98-99, November, 1912.  
-P-A-G-E-282
  272 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
there is more than a little evidence to show that such 
is the case. As to the ‘‘wonderful ritual’’ which fra- 
ternity members are expected to live up to, the writer 
says she has heard it described as ‘‘childish,’’ ‘‘poppy- 
cock,’’ and ‘‘bunk.’’ More temperate and convincing 
are the comments of a dean, who is herself a fraternity 
woman, on the ideals held up by the chapters: ‘‘They 
are not harmful, except that they are sentimental.’’ 
‘When we examine the claim that fraternities give val- 
uable training in household management and business 
affairs, again we meet with some opposing testimony. 
The writer quotes a dean and fraternity woman of 
many years standing who writes: ‘‘Usually the ac- 
counts of such an organization are not so well looked 
after as those of the more general women’s organiza- 
tions in which less of the ‘family’ idea prevails’’; 
and ‘‘the business training of these undergraduates 
. is probably inferior to that gained by officers in 
such bodies as the Women’s League, the Young 
Women’s Christian Association, the Student Govern- 
ment Association, or the boards of college publica- 
tions.’ + 
Miss Rickert next turns her attention to the claim 
that fraternities cultivate individuality and leadership. 
She finds a widespread tendency on the part of these 
organizations to select and develop types, not individ- 
uals, and cites the comments of fraternity girls to 
prove her point. For example: ‘‘You’d never think 
Caroline was a Chi Chi, would you? She ought to have 
been a Tau Tau.’’ And the shrewd forecasts of a fac- 
ulty member ‘‘that certain freshmen will make Gamma 
Gamma, and certain others Omicron Omega,”’ is a case 
20p. cit., pp. 99-10.
-P-A-G-E-283
  MANNERS AND MORALS 273 
in point. Certainly the argument of the writer that 
“fraternities are admitted to be groups in which like 
seeks like, and the whole flock aims to induce greater 
likeness to the pattern of the group’’ seems eminently 
reasonable. What place in these carefully selected 
groups, whose edges have been rubbed off, is there for 
“the girl with a streak of genius,’’ ‘‘the poor, proud 
girl [who] fears patronage’’ and ‘‘the dig [who 
dreads] missing some intellectual good thing’’? As to 
training in leadership, Miss Rickert finds that here, as 
elsewhere, ‘‘it is only the few that from the first show 
executive and business ability who get much training 
in these directions through fraternity membership.’’ 
But more serious than these defects are the charges 
that the writer brings against fraternities on the 
grounds of artificiality, snobbishness, and failure to 
serve the general good. With respect to the first 
characteristic she writes: The fraternity ‘‘is artificial 
because it chooses and restricts friendships. Close 
intimacy with outsiders is almost always made im- 
practicable by circumstances and the mutual attitude 
of the elect and the non-elect; and in some cases it is 
held to be disloyal to the chapter. It is artificial be- 
cause it strives to eliminate from a girl’s experience 
all incongruous and hostile elements, and these are 
often conducive to growth.’’? The fraternity girl, 
declares Miss Rickert, ‘‘lives in the rarefied atmos- 
phere of an artificially selected community ... 
[where] she is not allowed to come to grips with all 
sorts of conditions and people, by which alone is gained 
the personal, as opposed to the group, attitude toward 
life.”’ + 
1Ibid., p. 108. Italics mine. 
 
-P-A-G-E-284
  274 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
As to the charge of snobbishness, so commonly 
brought against fraternities, the writer’s investiga- 
tions strongly sustain it; and this in spite of the fact 
that fraternity women everywhere emphatically deny 
it. Indeed they insist that every effort is made to root 
out this attitude where it is found and to encourage 
democracy. But, as the author points out, ‘‘snobbery 
is the foundation-stone of the system, and when it goes, 
the system topples.’’ Where groups of students are 
divided info fraternity girls and barbarians, into 
‘‘frats’’ and ‘‘barbs,’’ a social chasm exists and will 
continue to exist. ‘‘Where there is a gap, there is a 
caste, and where caste is recognized, snobbery is in- 
evitable. When the fraternity woman disclaims snob- 
bery,.she means that she is careful not to emphasize 
the distinctions between herself and others.’’ More- 
over, the writer finds that the attempts of fraternities 
to bridge this gap do not support their claims of 
democracy. For example, in a recent report on social 
customs made by a committee of the Pan-Hellenic Soci- 
ety, ‘‘only three chapters mentioned any effort to be 
‘nice’ to the whole student body.’’ But Miss Rickert 
refuses to take too seriously the case of the girl who is 
left out. A large number of these students neither 
expect nor wish to ‘‘make’’ fraternities, and are un- 
affected by fraternity problems. ‘‘They have their 
own sets, their own social life, averaging more good 
times, perhaps, than they are credited with by their 
pitying superior sisters.’? As for the girl who hopes 
and fails to be ‘‘bid,’’ if she ‘‘is worth saving, she 
saves herself in the end; and if she gives up in despair 
and goes home because she does not ‘make a frat,’ she 
is not of the stuff that the college needs.”’
-P-A-G-E-285

Finally Miss Rickert examines the claim of the fra- 
ternities, united in the Pan-Hellenic Society, that their 
membership ‘‘is specially chosen and trained for serv- 
ice.’’? She concludes that aside from ‘‘a vague and 
general interest in alumne activities, this service is 
reduced to scholarships, some isolated attempts in edu- 
cation and philanthropy, a certain ‘dynamic force’ 
upon the character of its members, scarcely apparent 
to outsiders, and continued perfection of organization, 
thus far no more evident purpose than the reform of 
its own body.’’? With broad social vision the writer 
concludes her articles with certain penetrating ques- 
tions concerning the relation of the woman’s fraternity 
to society at large: 
“How does it stand in relation to the many needs of the world? 
Is it not rather like a crystallization of an immature stage of 
development? Why should a fraternity woman go about the world 
seeking only her own kind, like the missionary to China who wrote 
to her fraternity paper of the various social advantages that came 
to her through her encounters there with Greek sisters? . . . I be- 
lieve that the fraternities, notwithstanding individual benefits, are 
hastening on our ‘French Revolution’; they are creating a type that 
rules by habit rather than by individual power and wisdom; and by 
their inflexible system of caste they are emphasizing the gap, already 
more than sufficient for women as for men, between privilege and 
the working world.” * 
Can the Advantages of the Fraternity Be Secured 
by Other Means?—These lengthy quotations seem jus- 
tified because they are conclusions drawn from a 
genuine investigation covering a broad field, not the 
impressions of an individual confined to personal ex- 
perience. That the college fraternity is an undemo- 
cratic institution has been conceded by most thinking

  276 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
people. Nevertheless deans and parents have long 
recognized the practical service rendered by fraterni- 
ties in furnishing safe and pleasant homes for women 
students in those colleges and universities where the 
housing facilities are quite inadequate. No doubt this 
is one of the decisive reasons why they have been left 
undisturbed. Moreover, as Miss Rickert has pointed 
out, college authorities find that the fraternities can be 
trusted to stand solidly back of measures for student 
welfare and ‘‘to put things through.’’ Then, too, many 
a burdened dean of women must have appreciated the 
practical helpfulness of fraternities in looking out for 
the conduct and welfare of their own members, espe- 
cially of those ‘‘young barbarians’? who might give 
trouble. Undeniably these are outstanding merits in 
the fraternity system which, perhaps, may suggest a 
way out of the difficulty of providing individual social 
training for the army of young women gathered in our 
larger colleges and universities. In those institutions 
where the problem of housing women students is be- 
coming crucial, would it not be possible to experiment 
with the small cottage system rather than to go on 
building dormitories which are demonstrably unsatis- 
factory as a means of training individual character? 
Under such a plan every college woman would be 
housed in a comfortable home with a limited group of 
other students and would have opportunities for enter- 
taining and being entertained that would serve as a 
natural means of social training. Miss Rickert inclines 
to this scheme, even while she recognizes the difficulties 
involved in carrying it out. The most serious of these 
obstacles are, of course, concerned with space and ex- 
pense. The cottage system demands both more land
-P-A-G-E-287
  MANNERS AND MORALS 277 
and more money than the dormitory system. Further- 
more there are problems with respect to the successful 
grouping of the students and obtaining for each cottage 
a house-mother who embodies the rare qualities of ‘‘fine 
ability, tact, social distinction, and loving kindness.’’ 
Te secure enough women of such strong and gracious 
personality would be difficult indeed; and to pay them 
in accordance with their worth would require a larger 
salary fund than most colleges rejoice in. Miss Rick- 
ert suggests as a solution the selection from the grad- 
uating class of each year of young women who have 
had general rather than specialized training and who 
would be glad to give a year’s time to the duties of 
house-mother in return for board, lodging and privi- 
leges of graduate study. Of the advantages of such a 
plan she writes: 
“They would be near enough in age to sympathize with the under- 
graduate point of view, far enough away to counsel, direct and in- 
fluence; and they, acting with house-committees chosen by the house- 
hold of each cottage, could guide each little group in such a way 
as to insure a flexible system which would permit both the individual 
and social virtues to flourish.” * 
Under such a plan it would be possible to provide for 
personal help and guidance of the individual students 
who most need it, and to furnish ample opportunities 
for larger group work and recreation through the 
various college clubs and organizations. Such a sys- 
tem has been tried at Smith College with satisfying 
results. In each cottage are housed from fifty to sixty 
students, drawn from all four of the undergraduate 
classes. The upper class students in each house assume 
considerable responsibility in advising the younger 
+ “®xclusiveness among College Women,” in Century, 63: p. 282. 
   
-P-A-G-E-288
    278 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
girls and in overseeing their conduct. The college 
authorities believe that such a group is large enough 
to enable each student to find congenial companion- 
ship, while it is small enough to permit some degree of 
unity and house spirit. In such a group each girl feels 
herself of some importance. Although no statistics 
have been compiled, it is believed by the authorities 
at Smith that the result of this cottage system is to 
give every student a sense of her responsibility as a 
member of the community. This belief, of course, can- 
not be substantiated without careful study of the 
working of the system and of its results in drawing 
girls into community activities outside the college 
walls. However, if the arrangement merely fosters 
friendly feeling among house-mates and draws the un- 
sociable girl into the activities of college life it would 
probably justify itself. But it is a long step from the 
restricted, intra-mural interests of college girls, living 
in small towns where the importance of their doings 
tends to loom large on the social background, to the 
organized, intelligently planned community work such 
as is being done at Connecticut College for Women 
and a few other institutions. Obviously it is not safe 
to infer that the social interests generated in a limited 
and privileged group will ‘‘carry over’’ into the com- 
munity and the nation; or that the habits developed in 
a restricted environment will function successfully in 
the widely different situations presented by a larger 
social life. 
Social Education of High School Girls.—Hitherto 
the discussion of the problems in the social training of 
girls has been confined to the college and coeducational 
university. But the same problems appear in the
-P-A-G-E-289
  MANNERS AND MORALS 279 
education of girls of high school age, with the added 
difficulty that these schools are more often than not 
located in the heart of cities which offer every allure- 
ment to young people to neglect the school for the 
movie, the motor-party, and the dance. Add to this 
the fact that the high school girl comes under school 
influences for only five hours daily, after which time 
she is free to go where she will, and the problem of the 
high school adviser is rendered even more difficult 
than that of the dean of women. For, unless she can 
secure the intelligent codperation of the heme, her 
efforts to build up in unruly girls, bent on pleasure, 
saner standards of conduct and an interest in social 
activities of some inherent worth are grounded upon 
shifting sands. Every high school adviser who takes 
her task seriously must have felt the profound dis- 
couragement which comes from attempting to work 
against the influences of a home where the parents 
are bent upon making their daughter a ‘‘social suc- 
cess,’’ or where the mother is so absorbed in her own 
social life or family cares that she has little help to 
offer in overcoming the difficulties in the way of Dor- 
othy’s or Elsie’s social education. First of all, then, 
the adviser must consider how she can win the aid of 
father and mother in her campaign against cheap 
amusements and in behalf of wholesome recreation. 
Like the college, the high school also presents the 
problem of exclusive groups of girls whose social 
organizations not only fail to lead to any good end but 
prevent the establishment of more democratic societies 
that might promote growth. The sorority and the 
‘‘near’’ sorority, as well as the exclusive literary, dra- 
matic, and ‘‘social’’ clubs, spring up like mushroom   
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  280 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
growths in our public high schools which should be, 
above all things else, the training grounds of true 
democracy. School authorities who seek to substitute 
for these aristocratic clubs others with a wider social 
purpose and membership will do well to summon all 
the wisdom and tact with which they are endowed if 
they hope to enlist the good-will and codperation of 
the students in such a scheme. 
But there are not lacking individuals who will say: 
Are there not too many clubs in the high schools as it 
is? Should not they strive above all things to curtail 
social organizations rather than to form new ones? 
Clearly, the answer to this question is dependent upon 
our belief in the importance of educating girls to be 
socially minded in the democratic sense and to uphold 
standards of conduct that promote the general welfare. 
If we believe that this phase of education should be 
intelligently directed rather than frowned upon as a 
nuisance we shall agree with the high school principal 
who says: ‘‘It is true that our pupils have been 
‘clubbed’ to death, but it is also true that they have not 
been ‘clubbed’ in the right way.’’? Every teacher and 
adviser of adolescent girls knows well that to win the 
loyal support of a majority in the scheme of trans- 
forming exclusive pseudo-literary societies, dancing 
clubs, and sororities into democratic social organiza- 
tions for self-government, out-of-door sports and 
activities, debating, artistic photography, folk dancing, 
and worthwhile dramatic work is no light task. On 
the contrary it requires a faith in the social impulses 
of women, which can move mountains, together with 
all the enthusiasm, tact, and patient persistence of 
which its sponsors are capable. But if the adviser and
-P-A-G-E-291
MANNERS AND MORALS 281 
her cohorts win, if the transformation from exclusive- 
ness to democracy, from selfish, empty pleasure-seek- 
ing to enjoyable social activity with a purpose, is 
accomplished, then they have indeed cause for self- 
congratulation. For they will have set the feet of 
these girls in the path that leads to the rational enjoy- 
ment of leisure. More than this, they will have done 
something toward transforming an egoistic social but- 
terfly, who strives above all things to be ‘‘in the 
swim,’’ into a human being who has some real interest 
in other human beings, less socially popular than her- 
self, and who is coming to see that conceivably they 
have more to give her than she can give them. The 
improvement of the interests of leisure and the widen- 
ing and deepening of social contacts through the 
medium of recreation are outstanding needs in the 
education of many American girls.

  CHAPTER IX 
HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 
The Failure of America to Appreciate its Health 
Problem.—The student of educational history cannot 
fail to be impressed with the comprehensive way in 
which the Greeks envisaged the many-sided problem of 
education. Alone among ancient peoples the Greeks 
‘saw life steadily and saw it whole’’; and the catho- 
licity of their mental outlook on life naturally ex- 
pressed itself in their theories of education. Not only 
did the educative process appear to them as the devel- 
opment of the whole nature of man—intellectual, 
moral, and physical—but physical training itself was 
viewed with the same wholeness of vision. Therefore, 
bodily exercises and competitive games were conceived 
as means not only to the development of a healthy, 
vigorous physique, capable of enduring hardship in 
the military service of the state, but just as truly were 
they viewed as means to the attainment of physical 
grace, symmetry and moral poise. To achieve these 
ends, therefore, the Greeks were content to give half 
of every school day to physical education. 
The contrast between the Greek view and that of 
modern America is sharp and almost complete. Until 
very recently our national failure to appreciate our 
health problem has been dismal indeed, despite the 
283
-P-A-G-E-294
  284 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
fact that for many years a small group of educators 
has been urging the public to acquaint themselves with 
the facts concerning the physical unfitness of the 
American people. ‘‘In spite of marvelous scientific 
discoveries and achievements in the realm of health 
science in recent decades,’’ writes Rapeer, ‘‘we fail 
generally to realize how little health and normal physi- 
eal development have been socialized and made a part 
of our commonwealth.’’ + The facts when revealed are 
not pleasant reading. One-fourth to one-sixth of all 
children born in America die before reaching the 
school age of six years; nearly 100,000 school children 
die every year; and half of all who are born in any one 
year are in their graves before reaching the age of 
thirty. Nor are the facts concerning the health of our 
grown people more encouraging. The thorough exami- 
nations of department store women and employees of 
big business firms recently made by Dr. Kristine Mann 
and others reveal beyond a doubt that ‘‘nearly half of 
the workers of our indoor, city populations are low in 
vitality, suffer from physical defects, or harbor incipi- 
ent or well-developed cases of disease.’’ Conditions 
are not much better when we turn to the school popu- 
lation. Rapeer’s studies of school children show that 
less than one-third in any year are free from serious 
ailments or remediable physical defects; and if teeth 
defects be included the proportion rises sharply. 
Such conditions lead Rapeer to the conclusion that it 
‘would be a conservative judgment to say that on any 
one day of the school year at least five millions of our 
twenty-two million school children are in serious need 
1“Health as a Means to Happiness, Efficiency and Service,” in Annals 
of the Amer. Acad. of Polit. and Social Science, LXVII: 98, September 1916. 
Italics mine.
-P-A-G-E-295
HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 285 
of vigorous remedial measures to place them in even 
fairly normal condition.’ + 
These facts point to but one conclusion: neither the 
majority of educators nor the public in general are 
informed concerning these conditions; much less have 
they conceived their responsibility for them. Few 
indeed are the schools in America which have been 
built and equipped with the purpose of giving educa- 
tional hygiene an honorable place among the other 
aims of education. To quote Rapeer once more: 
“Our high schools ... almost entirely omit hygiene, ‘how to 
live,’ as either an elective or required subject. Physical education 
and medical supervision are still in most schools conspicuous by their 
absence. Only a small proportion of our elementary schools teach 
hygiene effectively and use the better textbooks made available in 
the last few years. Investigations of normal schools show that stu- 
dent-teachers do not generally get training along this line. Hygiene 
is absent, even as an elective, from most college curricula, notwith- 
standing the fact that our people, schooled and unschooled, con- 
tinue to fall by tens of thousands before typhoid, tuberculosis, and 
many other preventable diseases or vitality robbing defects!” 2 
The rude shock of war, with its unmistakable reve- 
lations concerning the physical defectiveness of even 
the most vigorous group of our young manhood, prob- 
ably did more to arouse the American people to a 
sense of their shortcomings with respect to health 
education than all the exhortations of experts and 
teachers. In consequence a bill, known as the Physi- 
cal Education Bill, has been introduced into both 
Houses of Congress. It provides for the distribution 
of a fund of $10,000,000 through the State Depart- 
ments of Education, each state to receive a share pro-

286 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
portionate to the number of chillden in the state be- 
tween the ages of six and eighteen. By the terms of 
the bill no state would receive an amount greater than 
that appropriated by state and local authorities for 
purposes of physical education. In his advocacy of 
the bill, its author, Senator Capper, said: 
“Tt has been conservatively estimated by the United States Com- 
missioner of Education that last year, 1920-21, there was a loss 
of approximately one hundred million dollars in the public schools, 
because of absence of enrolled children due to ill health. The young 
people in industry under the age of nineteen that would be affected 
by the legislation lost through ill health last year $71,250,000. These 
are only two of the readily calculable bills paid by the nation as 
the price of ill health and physical deficiency. If we can reduce 
these amounts alone by as much as ten per cent. we shall have saved 
more than the entire cost involved in this legislation. While we are 
spending hundreds of millions for battleships, I cannot but regard 
the proposed expenditure of ten million dollars for promoting the 
physical fitness of our youth as a wise and economical investment.” 
Neglect of the Physical Education of Women.—No- 
where has the failure of American education to con- 
serve and develop physical health been so conspicuous 
as in the realm of women’s education. While the rea- 
sons for securing to girls and women a sound physical 
development are at least as cogent as in the case of 
their brothers, only a fraction of the bodily training 
that is being given to boys and young men has, until 
recently, been accorded them. In a Report on Pitts- 
burgh Vacation Schools written in 1906, the president 
of one of the city vacation school systems expressed 
himself vigorously on this matter: 
“Our first sin of omission is not far to seek. It is our systematic 
neglect of girls. How few have looked with comprehending eyes 
upon the less aggressive companions of boys and seen their problem
-P-A-G-E-297
  HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 287 
also? Modern city conditions, overcrowding, lack of suitable places 
for play and for quiet normal living are more dangerous for girls 
than for boys. They succumb more readily to group influences. 
It is almost impossible to keep their modesty and self-poise in the 
constant mass living to which they are subject. They early lose their 
desire for play. We now follow the line of least resistance—give 
them the sweet sentimental books they like to read, encourage them 
to sit for hours prosaically sewing and allow them to gather in gossip- 
ing groups for the play hour, nor realize, because it all works so 
smoothly, that we have taken the wrong course in every particular. 
Everywhere the passive, the conventional, the formal. They will 
have need of bravery in the fight which is before them. Has it 
ever occurred to us to help them develop the sterner virtues? 
Have we substituted new views for the dominating emotional ones? 
Have we created in them the passion for a larger life and sense of 
the social order which gives them mental and moral poise? Have 
we tried to develop in them a healthy freedom and alertness of 
mind and body?” * 
Since this indictment was written a change has 
gradually been taking place in the popular attitude 
toward the physical education of girls and something 
has been done to enlarge their opportunities for gym- 
nastic training and athletic games. The reasons for 
this more favorable attitude are many, but two or 
three are outstanding. Since the higher education of 
women has become a fait accompli in America, physi- 
cians have been pointing out that in adolescence, the 
crucial period of a woman’s life, increasing demands 
are made on her for intellectual activity while nothing 
is done to preserve and improve her functional health, 
which is far from what it should be. Dr. Goldthwait, 
in his Shattuck lecture, has declared that the splendid 
work of the American school and college may prove 
2Quoted in Dudley and Kellor, Athletic Games for Women, pp. 19, 20.

-P-A-G-E-298
  
  288 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
actually harmful to the race by accentuating physical 
weakness unless our ideas of education are enlarged 
to include sound bodily development. Not long ago a 
New York physician complained of the ‘‘crop of worn- 
out school-girl neurasthenics’? who were received 
every month in the New York clinics for diseases of 
children. He graphically pictured the life of hurry, 
strain, and too great intellectual activity led by many 
conscientious girls who live in crowded city districts 
where out-of-door play and recreation are hard to 
obtain. Also he emphasized the fact that, during the 
years when most of the nervous energy of these girls 
is diverted to the brain, they are manufacturing new 
cells, building large additions in bone, muscle and 
glands, bringing their cerebro-spinal and sympathetic 
nerve systems under control, and developing a new 
function of enormous social importance. 
Another reason why the intelligent public is more 
favorable to the physical education of girls than ever 
before is the fact that thoughtful people are coming to 
understand that adolescent girls need outlets for their 
nervous energy no less than boys if they are not to 
harbor unwholesome ideas and desires or nourish ex- 
cessive sentimentality in ‘‘the cobwebbed corners of 
their minds.’’ The gymnasium and the playing field 
are the best correctives of the insurgent sex impulses 
of adolescence yet devised—for girls as well as boys. 
Perhaps the determining factor in developing an 
attitude of social approval of physical training for 
women has been and is the tremendously enlarged 
social opportunities and responsibilities of women 
which make exacting demands upon their self-control, 
self-reliance, and physical and nervous endurance.
-P-A-G-E-299
  HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 289 
No physical weaklings, undeveloped of muscle, defi- 
cient in nervous control and hampered by uncorrected 
bodily defects can ever hope to grapple successfully 
with the complicated situations of modern life as they 
arise in a vocation, in politics and in the give and take 
of strenuous social living. In consequence the minds 
of educators and public alike are slowly being pene- 
trated by the conviction that women must be physi- 
cally equipped to meet the strains of contemporary 
social life. 
Recent Achievements in Health Education in Amer- 
ica.—Since 1900 some advance has been made in this 
country in the health education of children and adults. 
The achievements of twenty years are well summarized 
by Rapeer: 
“The playground and recreation movement has swept across this 
country like fire in prairie grass. Millions are spent along these 
lines where nickels were expended in 1900. The movement is al- 
ready becoming scientific and is being standardized. Scientific health 
surveys of play and recreation for old and young are becoming every 
day more common. [Likewise medical inspection, school nursing, 
school dental clinics, public and school baths, more sanitary school 
buildings with gymnasia, sanitary drinking fountains, humidified air, 
scientific lighting, movable school desk-chairs, open-air and open- 
window schools, the feeding of school children, care in schools for 
mental defectives, cripples, the blind, and other unfortunate deviates, 
and an enormously improved health service in most cities and in 
many states—all bear witness to the rebirth of the physical conscious- 
ness of the race of which ages of asceticism, ignorant autocracy, and 
misdirected individualism almost robbed us.” * 
One gratifying phase of this nation-wide movement 
for the up-building of health is the enactment of state 
1“Health as a Means to Happiness, Hfficiency and Service,” in Annals 
of the Amer. Acad. of Polit. and Social Science, LXVII: 101, September, 
1916.
-P-A-G-E-300
  290 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
laws with this end in view. During the school year 
1918-19 legislation relative to health work or physical 
education was enacted in fifteen states. In eight of 
these the laws deal with health work and supervision; 
in six they relate to physical education; and in one 
state (Utah) they deal with ‘‘health education.’’ In 
1920, there were 20 states which had enacted laws 
providing for state-wide programs of physical educa- 
tion. These laws are designed to provide health work 
or physical education or both. The health laws, al- 
though varying in different states, provide for physi- 
eal inspection, dental inspection and in some cases 
free dental treatment of school children, the sanitary 
supervision of school buildings by full-time health 
officers, the employment of school and public health 
nurses, as well as school physicians, dentists, and ocu- 
lists. The laws relating to physical training enacted 
since 1915 are framed for girls as well as boys, and in- 
clude not only physical exercises but also ‘‘normal 
physical examination, building up of health habits and 
health knowledge in general, the promotion of the ideals 
and the practice of healthful living.’’? If these state 
enactments are carried out with sincerity and effi- 
ciency and if the various officials provided for in the 
laws—from the state director of physical education to 
the school nurse and teacher of educational hygiene— 
are adequately trained and remunerated, this country 
should see, in the course of a decade or two, such a 
rehabilitation of the health and nervous vigor of its 
people as will richly repay all efforts and expenditures 
to this end.

  HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 291 
A promising codperative movement to promote the 
health interests of women has been launched since the 
war by the National Women’s Organizations. In 1920, 
a committee on organization, consisting of the presi- 
dents of the National Women’s Suffrage Association, 
the National Women’s Trade Union League, the 
National Board of the "Y.W.C.A., the National 
Woman’s Christian Temperance Union and the Gen- 
eral Federation of Women’s Clubs, worked out a plan 
whereby two representatives from each of fourteen 
leading women’s organizations in the United States, 
together with the presidents of the organizations, were 
invited to attend a conference in New York City in 
October, to be held in connection with the final meet- 
ings of the International Conference of Women Physi- 
cians. A Committee of Seven was appointed to draw 
up a detailed plan to be presented at this meeting. 
The decision of the conference was that codperative 
effort to promote the physical and moral health of 
women was highly desirable and the plan of the Com- 
mittee of Seven was ratified. The new organization 
was christened the Women’s Foundation for Social 
Health and its declared purpose is ‘‘to carry to the 
highest efficiency the social health work of the coun- 
try... .’’ To this end the following principles were 
endorsed: 
1. That health should be emphasized as a positive part of life 
and not only as a fight against disease. 
2. That there shall be a frank recognition of the importance 
| of emotional health as well as a so-called physical health in the

3. That scientific data on these matters has now reached a point 
where it is available for lay as well as professional use.

4, That a receptive attitude toward these principles is needed on 
the part of lay women in order that scientific knowledge may be 
widely spread. 
5. That the codperative effort of all women is needed not only 
to carry out a sufficiently far reaching educational program but also 
to open up opportunities by means of which these principles may be- 
come the practical working basis of every day life. Concrete ex- 
amples of such opportunities would be recreation centers, health 
centers, ete. 
Needless to say such an awakening of women to the 
health needs of their own sex is a hopeful augury of 
educational reform in this regard only to the extent 
that women adopt a dynamic working program which 
they are prepared to carry out at the expense of time, 
money and consistent—not sporadic—effort. 
What Should Educational Hygiene Include?—The 
term ‘‘educational hygiene’’ is here used to include not 
only health but physical development. One of the most 
encouraging tendencies in the fields of medicine, public 
health work, and physical education is the increasing 
emphasis that is being placed upon preventive meas- 
ures rather than curative. Of course this is not to say 
that methods of remedying physical defects are neg- 
lected but rather to say that, after centuries of almost 
exclusive devotion to the task of effecting imperfect 
cures, physicians, public health nurses, and teachers 
of physical training are coming to the conviction that 
control of the sources of disease and deformity is more 
intelligent in method and more rewarding in results 
than locking the stable door after the horse has been 
stolen. In consequence questions of sanitation, diet, 
dress, fresh air, and exercise are taking their rightful 
place in all plans looking toward the upbuilding of 
health and physical vigor. 
 
-P-A-G-E-303
  
HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 293 
“Never in the history of the world,” [writes a professor of 
physical education in a woman’s college,] “have as many intelligent 
influences been at work to bar the door to disease and degeneracy, 
and to open the gates to health by giving to men and women every 
opportunity to overcome inherited weakness, to fortify themselves 
against the inroads of modern civilization, and to enable them to 
join the large aristocracy of the mentally and physically fit.” 
Not only are methods of preventing disease and 
physical defects receiving attention but it is increas- 
ingly recognized that the gap between illness and 
health can be bridged by individual attention and re- 
medial exercise. The physical director in high schools 
and colleges can render a peculiar service by giving 
careful physical examinations to every girl and by 
obtaining her ‘‘personal history.’’ Hspecially is this 
necessary for girls who desire to take part in athletics. 
A confidential relationship may thus be established 
between the physical director and the student which, 
if further developed by a régime of personal hygiene 
and corrective gymnastics, specially adapted to the 
girl’s needs, should do much to create in her standards 
and habits of healthful living. It is probable that a 
rather high percentage of young women in high 
schools, normal schools, and colleges are in need of 
specialized remedial exercises to correct such condi- 
tions as defects of posture and respiration, psychic 
nervous conditions, derangements of the digestive 
organs and pelvic organs, skin troubles and defects of 
the feet—especially flat foot which is more prevalent 
than is commonly known. Until very recently the fail- 
ure to give expert personal supervision to girls suffer- 
ing from one or more of these defects has been almost 
universal and even now is very general, especially in 
high schools where the need is most widespread.

ProBLeMs In THE PuysicaL Epucation or WoMEN 
The Indifference of Girls to Health.—In their efforts 
to build up the health of the girls and young women in 
their charge most teachers will find a stubborn obsta- 
cle not only in the ignorance of the simplest matters 
of hygiene shown by many girls but also in their indif- 
ference to matters of health. After eight years of 
experience, the director of physical training in a girl’s 
boarding school writes feelingly on this subject: 
“That the majority of girls are ignorant of the natural physical 
conditions that exist in life, or even wish to know them, is plainly 
evident. The malady sweeps thru the land, and the artificial and 
the defective meet us on every hand. The absorbing and vital 
problem is the remedy.” * 
How to combat the complacency of girls with their 
own ignorance of the laws of health, not to mention 
their willingness to flout these laws when they are 
known, is a knotty problem. Miss Eddy suggests two 
methods of attack, both of which offer some promise of 
success. The first is that schools shall demand that 
‘a diploma of graduation include a certain degree of 
physical, as well as of mental attainment.’’ Secondly, 
that educators insist upon simple, sensible, hygienic 
dress for growing girls on the ground that faulty 
fashions are responsible, to a certain extent, for physi- 
eal defects. It is probably not generally recognized 
that the period of growth is the time when deformities 
are most readily acquired as well as most easily cor- 
rected. Among girls physical weakness not -infre- 
quently accompanies rapid growth, and the vital or- 
iJean E. Eddy, “Physical Betterment for Our Growing Girls,” in Educ. 
Rev., 36:190, September, 1908.
-P-A-G-E-305
  BN SE Te RR cS a ee ge 
HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 295 
gans are often thrown out of their normal position 
during this period, thus laying the foundation for 
disease. On this point Miss Eddy writes: 
“The most conspicuous habits that contribute to disease are faults 
of form and carriage. Among them may be mentioned: dropping 
of the chest, causing it to be flat and narrow; rounding of the 
shoulders; forward position of the head; curving of the spine at 
the neck and waist; also a lateral curve; protruding of the abdomen, 
of the hips; weight upon the heels; tenseness; undue restlessness, 
and kindred others.” * 
But faulty carriage is not the sole cause of the 
physical defects that so frequently characterize grow- 
ing girls. Almost as important a factor are the exist- 
ing fashions in dress. What person who has anything 
to do with the education of adolescent girls has not 
met with this problem and come to know it as a stub- 
born enemy? With some girls the adoption of the 
latest fad in dress seems to be the supreme interest of 
life beside which studies and even sports pale into 
insignificance. Not content with the loose, hygienic 
dress suitable to school girls, many young women enter 
boarding-schools and colleges with the inappropriate 
and unhygienic wardrobe of a society woman. From 
year to year the arbitrary demands of Dame Fashion 
vary; yet within a comparatively short period her 
votaries have been required to wear tight corsets, 
heavy skirts, stiff collars, gauzy low-necked waists, 
paint and powder, skirts so narrow as to impede walk- 
ing, filmy stockings, and, above all, pointed, high heeled 
shoes. Not one of these semi-barbaric fashions but 
has its effect, great or small, upon healthful growth. 
So weak, if not non-existent, is the influence of many

-P-A-G-E-306
296 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
parents that the responsibility for combating unhy- 
gienic fashions has fallen rather heavily upon the 
shoulders of the school authorities. In boarding- 
schools and colleges, the physical training depart- 
ments have tended to insist upon simple, whole- 
some modes of dress, allowing for free movement 
and growth. The adoption of a becoming uniform 
in many boarding-schools shows what can be done if 
the school authorities will take a firm stand on this 
question. 
In high schools the problem is obviously more com- 
plicated, since the girls are living at home under the 
direct control of their parents. Yet the matter of 
hygienic dress is so vital to the physical—and there- 
fore to the intellectual and moral—development of 
girls that some way must be found by educators to 
meet this difficulty. Clearly this lies in the direction 
of enlisting the interest and help of the mothers them- 
selves, who are often either quite ignorant of the hy- 
gienic aspects of dress or are indifferent to the matter. 
To secure the codperation of thousands of homes in a 
campaign against unhealthful fashions is a colossal 
task; yet this is precisely what great urban high 
schools must accomplish if they are to perform their 
plain duty in building up the health of adolescent girls. 
Those high schools which are so fortunate as to boast 
gymnasiums, playing fields, and directors of physical 
training will find the problem somewhat simplified, 
since an astute teacher of gymnastics and athletic 
sports can do much toward substituting a fashion for 
hygienic dress and vigorous physique for the prevail- 
ing modes. In parent-teacher associations, also, the 
use of moving pictures to illustrate the effect of certain 
 
-P-A-G-E-307
HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 297 
fashions in producing physical defects as well as to 
create in the minds of parents a standard of appro- 
priate, becoming dress for active girls might help on 
the good work. 
Functional Periodicity as a Health Problem.—In 
view of the larger life opening to women and the seri- 
ous social responsibilities resting upon them, the prob- 
lem of establishing the menstrual function upon a 
healthy and comparatively painless basis assumes 
critical importance. No girl or woman who is inca- 
pacitated two days or more in every month can throw 
herself very effectively into a strenuous campaign for 
social or political betterment or carry on a vocation 
with satisfaction to herself or her employer. It seems 
highly probable that physicians and women themselves 
have too long looked upon functional periodicity as a 
time when girls should be encouraged to coddle them- 
selves and even to indulge in what Stanley Hall de- 
scribes as ‘‘sentimental instability.’’ This is not to 
say that all girls can carry on their accustomed activi- 
ties without modification during the menstrual period 
or even to deny that there is a considerable number of 
young women suffering from organic derangements 
which require careful treatment. It is only to main- 
tain that physicians and women themselves have been 
all too prone to regard a normal function in most 
women as a ‘‘curse of Eve’’ in all, and to take it for 
granted that regular occupations, no less than vigor- 
ous bodily activity, must be laid aside or greatly re- 
duced during menstruation. Such an attitude has 
had its inevitable results: painful menstruation to- 
gether with nervous instability have been accepted as 
inescapable periodic illness, not as a health prob- 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  
298 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
lem to be intelligently attacked like any other life 
problem. 
The profound mistake involved in such supine ac- 
ceptance of physical ailments has just begun to be 
perceived by a handful of physicians and physical 
directors. Reference has already been made to the 
views of Dr. Clelia Mosher, formerly resident physi- 
cian at Leland Stanford University. On the basis of 
a study of 800 women, during a total 6,000 or more 
menstrual periods, she records her conviction that the 
chief causes of the periodic disability of women are 
(1) the periodic raising and lowering of the general 
blood pressure due to the upright posture, this condi- 
tion being grossly exaggerated in the case of women 
by (2) physical inactivity and (3) constrictive dress. 
A fourth contributing cause is the idea that menstru- 
ation is an illness. With regard to the last named 
cause Dr. Mosher writes feelingly: 
“The first step in the physical regeneration of women is to alter 
their habits of mind in regard to bodily functions. They now ac- 
cept periodic disability as inevitable. The terms “sick time,’ “un- 
well,” etc., for the function of menstruation and the mental accept- 
ance of disability are so firmly fixed in traditional thinking that it is 
difficult to get a woman even to try to be well, however simple the 
method of relief offered her. ... The first of these remedies is 
the removal of the factors which are producing the disability—con- 
strictive clothing and the inactivity of the muscles of the abdomen 
and the diaphragm. But more important even than this is an altera- 
tion of the morbid attitude of women themselves toward this 
function, and almost equally essential is a fundamental change in 
the habit of mind on our part as physicians; for do we not tend 
to translate too much the whole of a woman’s life into terms of 
menstruation? If every young girl were taught that menstruation 
is not normally a “bad time” and that pain or incapacity at that 
period is as discreditable and unnecessary as bad breath due to
-P-A-G-E-309
  HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 299 
decaying teeth, we might also look for a revolution in the physical 
life of women.” * 
Dr. Mosher’s conclusions receive interesting support 
from a recent study by Dr. E. H. Arnold of the effects 
of school work on menstruation. The subjects of the 
investigation were normal school students over 18 
years of age. At the outset Dr. Arnold gives one of 
his reasons for making the experiment: 
“From my experience as a physician and teacher I was convinced 
that much of the incapacity claimed (at the menstrual period) was 
of a fictitious nature, and that not only was exercise at this time not 
only not injurious, but on the other hand directly beneficial. It 
seemed to me that at this time when woman is entering fields which 
heretofore have been considered man’s province her chance of suc- 
cess would depend to a large extent upon her physical efficiency, and 
that if this is true, as it has been taken for granted, that during 
her menstrual period she is more or less incapacitated, her efficiency 
would be lowered about one-sixth. She could, therefore, never 
expect to be recompensed to the same degree or considered as efficient 
as man in the same fields of endeavor.” 2 
Dr. Arnold’s study comprised 238 girl students in a 
normal school of gymnastics in New Haven. They 
were required to fill out cards giving a record of each 
menstrual period during the school year for a period 
of two years. The cards asked for information con- 
cerning the number of days of menstruation, pain 
(mild, severe, sharp, dull,) flow, general condition 
(headache, ete.,) and hours of mental and physical 
work. Starting with the attempt to prevent students 
from absenting themselves from class work without 
due cause, the experiment gradually was extended. 
First, students were not excused from any mental

-P-A-G-E-310
  300 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
work at this time; next they were not excused from all 
physical work except where they were quite certain it 
would be injurious. The next step was to make at- 
tendance upon the less severe forms of exercise com- 
pulsory, granting excuses only in a very few special 
eases. ‘‘When the results from this seemed satisfac- 
tory,’’ writes Dr. Arnold, ‘‘we determined to grant 
excuses for any form of exercise at this time only in 
special cases. At the present time the pupils take part 
in all the exercises at this time except swimming. .. . 
We have attained for our pupils that which I was con- 
vinced was possible from a theoretic point of view, 
namely, a nine months’ course of physical training 
which means for each pupil really a course of nine 
months.”’ 
What of the results of this daring experiment? Dr. 
Arnold leaves us in no doubt: ‘‘ Within two years... 
the student has reduced her incapacity for work dur- 
ing the menstrual period to a negligible quantity. . . . 
In the next couple of years the rise in working capac- 
ity will continue, we have no doubt, and will reach 
well over 90 per cent. When the working capacity of 
women reaches 90 per cent., their efficiency, so far as 
amount of work goes, is practically at par with that 
of man... . Considering the amount of work done, 
the small improvements shown in regularity, duration, 
clots, pain, ete., will take on a new meaning, namely, 
that in spite of an increased amount of work, not only 
has there been no deleterious result, but the periods 
have become slightly farther apart, shorter in duration 
and milder in pain. We have gained the one-fifth in 
work which before was lost.’’ *

-P-A-G-E-311
HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 301 
This is surely interesting and encouraging to those 
who have faith in woman’s powers to be and to do. 
And be it noted that Dr. Arnold’s conclusions were 
arrived at not by the facile method of empirical opin- 
ion but by a careful experiment carried on with a 
considerable number of young women over a period 
of two years. However, it need hardly be said that 
one such experiment is not conclusive evidence. Many 
more tests involving much larger numbers of young 
women and a well-planned system of ‘‘following up’’ 
tests must be made before any confident conclusions 
can be drawn. Unfortunately, so firmly rooted is the 
notion that physical exercise is harmful during men- 
struation that in the author’s knowledge no physical 
director has been found courageous enough to attempt 
a similar experiment and publish his results. Thus 
the whole question remains an unsolved problem and 
many thousands of women at present continue to re- 
gard themselves as incapacitated for serious work 
during a portion of every month. Until this handicap 
is removed women will labor under a disadvantage in 
all activities which bring them in competition with 
men. 
But the functional health of the American girl is 
important not alone as a means to an active and useful 
life but also because she is destined to be the mother 
of the future generations. The perfecting of the sex- 
ual organism of young women is, obviously, Nature’s 
supreme task; and yet for untold centuries the func- 
tion most intimately connected with healthy mother- 
hood has been a noli me tangere. Under a historic 
taboo, menstruation has not been the subject of that 
scientific investigation which must guide all efforts
-P-A-G-E-312
302 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
toward functional improvement. It is not strange, 
then, that the effects of mental or physical overwork 
upon the healthy maturing of the sexual organism of 
girls is just beginning to be understood. Only within 
recent years have physicians and teachers recognized 
any connection between sterility or still-births on the 
one hand and excessive mental strain in the early years 
of adolescence on the other. The critical period in 
a girl’s life falls earlier than has been supposed—be- 
tween the ages of ten and fifteen. During these years 
preparation for the menses must be laid in hygienic 
habits and out-of-door play and sports. After men- 
struation sets in, too much care cannot be taken to 
establish it with regularity and so far as possible to 
render the function painless. The nervous strain felt 
by some girls in meeting the requirements for en- 
trance into the high school and in maintaining a good 
standing after getting in is a serious drain upon their 
functional health and should be avoided at all costs, 
even at the expense of another year in the grades or 
the high school. 
Tue Question or Sex Hpucation 
Is Sex Education Necessary and Desirable?—The 
urgent need for an enlightened public opinion favor- 
able to sex education of girls and boys has long been 
apparent to physicians and social workers. In 1905 
was organized the American Society of Sanitary and 
Moral Prophylaxis, having as its avowed end a ‘‘so- 
cial defense against a class of diseases which are most 
injurious to the highest interests of human society.’’ 
This organization was the forerunner of a long line 
of Social Hygiene Societies which sprang up in various
-P-A-G-E-313
   HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 303 
localities throughout the United States during the 
next eight years. In 1913 two of the most important 
of these associations were united in the American 
Social Hygiene Association with its headquarters in 
New York City. The primary purpose of all these 
organizations has been to educate the public mind to 
an appreciation of the prevalence and the dangerous 
character of the social diseases and to arouse it to the 
need for education of the young in sex hygiene and 
sex ethics. Thus the movement for sex education, as 
Dr. Maurice Bigelow has pointed out, started as ‘‘san- 
itary propagandism,’’ based upon certain indisput- 
able facts of sanitary science, and tended to empha- 
size ‘‘physical punishments for immorality rather 
than (to) offer ethical and psychical rewards for 
morality.’’? 
It is not surprising that these early movements 
were attended with much sensationalism and that the 
interest of the public tended to focus upon the more 
startling and abnormal phases of sex life. But already 
evidence is accumulating that a reaction has set in 
against the over-emphasis of certain writers upon 
sexual degeneracy and in favor of a constructive at- 
tack upon the problem of sex education. In the words 
of Dr. Bigelow, one of the leaders in the social hygiene 
movement: 
“The wave of sensational revelation has passed; but the intelli- 
gent public is no longer ignorant of the nature and causes of the 
great problems of sex, and is well aware that young people need 
definite guidance for facing the facts of life. It is unthinkable 
that intelligent parents who are now well informed concerning sex 
will ever again stand for the old policy of mystery and silence.” 2

-P-A-G-E-314
304 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
Beyond doubt many parents have been awakened 
to a sense of the stupidity and harmfulness of the 
ancient taboo upon frank discussion of the facts and 
problems of sex. Yet there is ample evidence to show 
that large numbers, perhaps the majority of parents, 
are not thus enlightened and still cling to the theory 
that girls should be left entirely ‘‘innocent’’ of sex 
knowledge, even though it may be advisable to give to 
boys some information concerning the awful penalties 
for sexual promiscuity. Such parents have, in most 
instances, quite forgotten the dubious sources from 
which they acquired their own sex knowledge at an 
early age. There is good reason for believing that 
the ‘‘innocence’’? (meaning ignorance) of most girls 
is a myth and that a large majority of even carefully 
nurtured girls have ‘‘picked up”’ the essential informa- 
tion about the facts of life before they were fifteen 
years old. It is, of course, the fact that the first sex 
knowledge of many girls comes from corrupt sources, 
which inevitably color their attitudes and feelings 
toward sex matters in harmony with its own vulgarity, 
that constitutes the strongest argument for a sane sex 
education of girls. Parents and educators must de- 
cide, then, whether they will assume responsibility for 
wholesome sex instruction of youth or will ‘‘continue 
to permit childhood to gain its information from cor- 
rupt and foul sources, from erotic literature, or from 
the evil traditions of the gang.’’ 
Unquestionably the reluctance of many parents to 
sanction the sex education of their daughters is due 
to a fear, more or less well-grounded, that such in- 
struction might stir up dormant sex curiosity and sex 
feeling and thus do more harm than good. Another
-P-A-G-E-315
HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 305 
eause for reluctance lies in their anxiety lest frank 
sex instruction might give a profound and unpleasant 
shock to sensitive girls from the effects of which they 
might never wholly recover. Obviously if sex educa- 
tion is to be introduced into schools and colleges the 
methods of instruction must be planned with the ut- 
most care in the light of biology, adolescent psychol- 
ogy, and the social environments of the students. 
Suggestions for a Plan of Sex Education.—The prob- 
lems arising out of various attempts to put into opera- 
tion a practical program of sex education have been 
discussed for several years and certain conclusions 
appear to have been agreed upon by leading educators 
identified with the movement. First, it seems clear 
that sex education should be looked upon as an integral 
part of general education and should not be sharply 
separated from it as has been done in the past. There 
is grave danger in isolating sex facts and problems for 
special consideration, at least before adolescence, 
that these may assume too prominent and unrelated a 
place in the minds of children. The ancient ban laid 
upon all reference to sex matters in the direction of 
girls has caused teachers to ignore or slur over such 
references in literature, history, the social sciences, 
and even nature study. And yet in these, and other 
studies, are rich opportunities to discuss frankly and 
critically such sex questions as arise and to help girls 
to acquire standards and ideals with regard to sex 
relations in social life. Dr. Bigelow has suggested the 
Idylls of the King as containing a mine of valuable 
literary material centering about problems of love. 
These, in the hands of skillful and idealistic teachers, 
might well contribute to a better understanding of
-P-A-G-E-316
306 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
the true relations of the sexes in a civilization which 
has passed from the brutal to the spiritual. The same 
holds true of history, ethics, and sociology. When 
taught by trained and large-minded teachers, the pos- 
sibilities of these subjects for furnishing sex informa- 
tion and developing wholesome sex ideals are rich and 
varied. 
But it is pretty generally agreed that the subject 
of biology furnishes the best foundation, in pre- 
adolescent years, for a subsequent understanding of 
the facts of life in the human sphere. A candid and 
scientific study of reproduction in plants and animals is 
the best possible approach to a similar study of human 
reproduction in the years between fourteen and eight- 
een. Probably all the sex knowledge a carefully 
brought up girl needs before puberty is such informa- 
tion as she may obtain in a well-planned course in 
elementary biology or ‘‘nature study,’’ together with 
such facts as her mother may deem it wise to give her. 
And here we come upon several! questions that must 
be briefly considered. Girls before puberty, in the 
years from ten or eleven to thirteen, need certain guid- 
ance and information to protect them against the vul- 
gar conversation of their playfellows, as well as 
against harmful sex habits. Almost universally in the 
past parents have shrunk from giving this knowledge 
and help and, ostrich-like, have thrust their heads into 
the sand, believing that they might avoid all difficulties 
by not facing them. Therefore, advocates of sex edu- 
cation have come to see that their first concern must 
be with the parents themselves. Unless their uncriti- 
cal allegiance to the age-old ban upon sex knowledge 
can be broken down; unless they can be interested
-P-A-G-E-317
  
HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 307 
in acquiring the necessary information as well as the 
best methods of imparting it to their girls when it is 
needed, the schools will be seriously handicapped in 
all that they attempt to do by way of sex education. 
Consequently, the education of mothers and fathers, 
through parent-teacher associations and special meet- 
ings to consider the problems of sex education at dif- 
ferent periods of child-life becomes essential. Such 
education would not only give information to par- 
ents; it would awaken them to the profound importance 
of keeping the confidence of their children by frank 
and honest replies to such questions as they may ask. 
The mother who has failed to foster a spirit of trust 
and mutual understanding between herself and her 
daughter has lost a very precious thing, almost im- 
possible to reclaim; and this loss will make her efforts 
to give sex enlightenment and guidance both more 
difficult and less rewarding. Some mothers, at 
least, need to be reminded of this fact and helped 
to find the best ways of holding their daughter’s 
confidence. 
In the years before puberty girls should be told the 
essential facts about the human reproduction and 
should be prepared by their mothers for the physio- 
logical changes which take place at puberty. There 
are few intelligent adults who do not know instances 
of harm wrought to sensitive girls by withholding from 
them all information concerning the menstrual func- 
tion until its first appearance. The meaning and the 
hygiene of menstruation should be explained to every 
girl by her own mother, who can best surround this 
function with the dignity and social significance which 
is its due. At the same time she should avoid all sug- 
 
-P-A-G-E-318
308 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
gestion of menstruation as an illness or an infirmity 
of sex. 
After puberty, educators are agreed that the girl 
is ready to build upon the foundation of biological 
knowledge gained in school and on the elementary 
facts of sex learned at home a superstructure of more 
advanced sex knowledge and understanding. In the 
last year of the elementary school and during the four 
years of high school girls should be given, in biology or 
hygiene courses, more scientific and detailed instruc- 
tion concerning sexual structure and the facts of hu- 
man reproduction. The introduction of this more ad- 
vanced sex education into the eighth grade of the 
public schools seems justified by the fact that a large 
number of girls will go to work after finishing the 
elementary course. Indeed it seems hardly open to 
doubt that sex instruction should be given to those 
large groups of girls who seek to obtain their ‘‘work- 
ing papers’’ as soon as they have reached the legal age 
for leaving school, although they may not have com- 
pleted the sixth grade. No informed person can deny 
that girls in trade and industry are exposed to peculiar 
dangers and temptations against which neither the 
school nor the home has in most cases seriously at- 
tempted to fortify them. To these girls as well as 
to those in high school should be given scientific in- 
formation concerning the names and function of their 
sexual organs. Biologists are no doubt correct in 
maintaining that a frank, scientific approach to these 
matters, coupled with the use of the scientific names 
for sex organs and functions, does much to dispel 
earlier vulgar associations and to develop in girls a 
much-needed scientific attitude toward questions of
-P-A-G-E-319
  HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 309 
sex. Dr. Bigelow suggests the following topics in sex 
physiology as important for girls to know between 
fourteen and sixteen or eighteen: 
“The meaning of puberty as the beginning of a long fertile period 
of about thirty years; the nature of menstruation as a periodical 
process preparing the lining of the uterus for reception and attach- 
ment of an embryo if a sperm-cell meets a liberated egg-cell near 
an ovary, and not a season of illness invented by the powers of 
darkness; the possibility of fertilization following sexual relations 
at any time during the fertile life of a woman; the essential facts 
of sexual relation as a method of depositing sperm-cells so that 
they can swim on the way to meet an egg-cell; and the nature of 
the close blood relationship of mother and embryo.” * 
In the reaction against an over-emphasis upon the 
grim results of sexual promiscuity, with its attendant 
venereal diseases, educators are coming to doubt the 
value of giving carefully nurtured girls under eighteen 
anything more than the essential facts of the existence © 
of prostitution and social diseases. But it seems plain 
to the writer that young women of seventeen and over 
should receive enlightened guidance in understanding 
the difficult problems growing out of romantic love and 
marriage. Girls need to develop a more serious and 
idealistic attitude toward love between the sexes and 
to comprehend far more clearly than most of them 
do the difficult adjustments to be made in marriage if 
it is to be harmonious and satisfying. Furthermore, 
young women should be made to understand that they 
cannot escape a measure of moral responsibility for 
the sexual conduct of their men friends and acquaint- 
ances. Physicians and educators have accumulated 
a depressing body of facts which show that girls who 
dress so as to expose their bodies, who dance in close

310 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
physical contact with men, and who carry flirtation 
to its extreme limits, have so aroused the sex passion 
in their young men associates that these youths have 
over and over again sought the prostitute as an outlet 
for their inflamed sex impulses. These are not pleas- 
ant facts; but it is the merest prudery, as well as 
selfish denial of women’s responsibility, for parents 
to object to their daughters being informed of the 
truth. In the days of chivalry the fair flower of court- 
esy was in a very special sense placed in the guardian- 
ship of women. To-day, as then, the finer standards 
and ideals of sex relationship must be upheld chiefly 
by women whose task it is to lead men to an enlightened 
acceptance of them. 
The Need for Playgrounds and Athletic Fields for 
Girls.— When American public opinion became tardily 
convinced of the value of physical training for boys 
and girls the gymnasium was included in plans for 
the better types of school buildings. However, 
although school gymnasiums have spread rapidly 
throughout the country, Curtis estimates that in 1915 
they served less than five per cent. of the children of 
school-growing age. Moreover, gymnastics, valuable 
as they may be, are probably too formal in character 
to meet the needs of individuals who require both ex- 
ercise and recreation. Writing on the shortcomings 
of gymnastics Curtis says: 
“All systems of gymnastics have been developed for the purpose 
of military training. Their purpose is to create muscular strength. 
Gymnastics, thus far, have not met the physical needs of Americans 
and they probably never will. ... Gymnastics are an unnatural 
form of exercise. Take the pulley weights, as an example. The 
motions involved have never been required in human history: They 
are uninteresting and soon become a bore. . . . They are physical
-P-A-G-E-321
  HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 311 
exercise, but man has never before had physical exercise (as an end). 
He has sought to accomplish certain results, and both physical and 
mental exercise have been incidental to accomplishment. Gymnastics 
are mostly indoors, where the air is not the best, and so far as they 
are done at word of command, the strain of voluntary attention is 
nearly or quite as great as that of the classroom. Many of the 
muscular movements involved are of the accessory kind.” * 
This, of course, is not to condemn gymnastics but 
merely to point out their limitations. In the fall and 
spring when the weather is most beguiling, there is 
real need, especially in crowded cities, for playing 
fields for boys and girls. Because girls have, up to the 
present, been both more passive and more secretive 
than boys, parents and teachers have by no means 
realized how much they are in need of the vitalizing, 
morally tonic effect of organized play and sports out 
of doors to free their minds from unwholesome curios- 
ity, sentimental notions, and foolish conventionality. 
The President of the Pittsburgh Playground Associa- 
tion, after declaring that when a girl she had been 
“almost transformed by a season of basket ball and 
tennis,’? adds: ‘‘The playground can have no more 
vital and important mission than the substitution of 
healthful, bracing, character-building play for the 
idleness and enervating amusements of these future 
mothers of sons. When we have a race of women 
pure-hearted, large-hearted, and brave, we shall not 
need to be concerned about the social evil.’ ? 
Although the playground movement has swept the 
country during the last ten years and almost every 
large city from Boston to San Francisco points with

pride to its fields for games and sports, few who know 
of the extensive need for these recreation grounds, of 
the thousands and thousands of girls and boys not yet 
provided for, will be satisfied with what has been ac- 
complished. Not only are more playing fields needed, 
but better equipped ones, with better trained physical 
directors and teachers, paid from public funds. Such 
men and women would understand not only how to 
organize sports and games for all children, suited to 
their interests and physical condition, but how to 
develop through these sports working standards of 
wholesome recreation, of good sportsmanship and hon- 
esty, which would help to combat the unwholesome and 
vicious allurements of large cities. 
Should Athletics for Girls be the Same as for Boys 
and Men?— Athletics for girls have scarcely passed out 
of the stage of infancy at the present writing. Mid- 
Victorian ideals of a delicate ‘‘female,’’ worshipping 
at the shrine of the conventions, are chiefly responsible 
for the tardiness of their appearance... But it can 
hardly be doubted that physicians, by applying judg- 
ments of physical unfitness derived from treating 
feeble and sickly women to the entire sex—healthy or 
unhealthy—have played their part in retarding the 
progress of athletic training for girls. Now that col- 
leges and some high schools, as well as Public School 
Athletic Leagues and Playground Associations, are 
making athletics for girls quite respectable, the ques- 
tion arises: What sort of organized sports shall we 
sponsor for girls? In the past, of course, athletics 
have been the prerogative of men and have probably 
served the dual function of recreative sport and an 
outlet for men’s inherited fighting instinct. Miss
-P-A-G-E-323
  HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 313 
Burchenal, formerly of the Public Schools Athletic 
League of New York City, declares that competitive 
athletics ‘‘have evolved from the primitive pursuits 
and activities of men—not women.’’ Because ‘‘woman 
is the product of a different physical specialization’’ 
from that of men the writer regards any attempt 
to foist men’s athletics upon girls and women as il- 
logical. Moreover, except for a small percentage of 
healthy, muscular girls of superabundant energy, she 
believes that most young women find very little appeal 
in men’s athletics. Therefore she urges that direc- 
tors of physical education ‘‘break away entirely from 
the idea that in order to have athletics for girls we 
must approach the subject from a man’s point of view, 
and . . . evolve (their) own individual, natural sports 
regardless of whether or not they coincide with those 
of men.’’? 
The differences in build of the typical woman and 
of the typical man have frequently been pointed out 
by physicians. Especially have these been emphasized 
by Dr. Sargent, who has shown in terms of mechanics 
that certain athletic exercises popular with men are 
performed with great difficulty even by girls of extraor- 
dinary muscular development, while such exercises 
are impossible for the majority of young women. The 
structural differences between the sexes are beyond 
question and in themselves would seem to necessitate 
modifications of men’s athletics to adapt them to wom- 
en’s physique. But this is not all. Teachers and 
directors of physical education have for some years 
been sounding notes of warning against men’s ath-

Vol. I, No. 37, pp. 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
  314 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
letics for girls on the ground of the evil effects of 
these sports both physically and mentally. Women 
themselves, in adult life, trace certain internal de- 
rangements from which they suffer to their too vigor- 
ous efforts to win distinction in men’s athletics. Miss 
Burchenal quotes two such cases as follows: 
“By my continued practice of high jumping, vaulting and other 
violent exercises, I was injured internally, and I know of several 
others who were also.” 
And another writes: 
“T have felt that my internal derangement was caused by my 
violent physical exertions. You probably remember my wild am- 
bitions. But besides that, I feel very strongly that I sapped my 
strength and vitality to a degree from which I never have and 
never shall recover.” * 
It is a disagreeable fact which must, nevertheless, 
be faced that a large proportion of girls enter high 
school in poor physical condition, partly owing to 
inherited weaknesses which have not been corrected, 
partly to unhygienic living and too little out-of-door 
exercise. A teacher of physical training for girls re- 
cently declared that in looking over her high school 
enrollment of three hundred and fifty girls she found 
the names of only fourteen that she considered really 
strong and vigorous. Certainly, if such conditions are 
general in our urban centers, the rules and conditions 
of men’s athletics should be materially modified to 
suit the needs of weak and physically undeveloped 
girls. And such adaptations appear to have been very 
generally made.

Honors and Incentives in Competitive Games. — 
There prevails a very general opinion among teachers 
of physical education for girls that the stimulus of com- 
petition and rewards is necessary to induce girls in 
large numbers to enter the field of athletics at all. 
In many high schools only one hour a week is required 
in physical training—if any requirement is made. 
That throws the entire organization of competitive 
sports into the hours after school work is finished and 
makes participation in such sports voluntary. This 
fact accounts in some measure for the competitive 
character of girls’ athletic games; for in this way a 
powerful appeal is made to a fundamental instinct, 
and interest is thereby aroused to a high point. Tradi- 
tion also plays its part, since boys’ athletics have been 
competitive from the days of the ancient Greeks. To 
the powerful incentive of success in competitive games 
is usually added a system of honors, both team and 
individual, which still further whets the interest of 
girls in organized sports and lures them on to undergo 
more or less exacting training and hygienic discipline. 
The system of honors quite commonly employed in- 
cludes the donation of a trophy to a successful team 
and of class numerals, school letters, and a school 
sweater to individual girls who win a stipulated num- 
ber of honors in athletic contests, prescribed exercises 
on the horse, rings, horizontal ladder, etc., track and 
field events, and swimming. 
In the opinion of not a few educators the strong 
emphasis laid upon competition in sports and the use 
of honors as rewards has been excessive and pro- 
ductive of undesirable results. Too many girls (as 
well as boys) have played to win, not for fun, or to
-P-A-G-E-326
  316 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
achieve personal distinction, not to serve their team. 
Moreover, the nervous strain inevitably accompanying 
intense competitive activity is recognized by many 
physical directors as a dubious, if not positively harm- 
ful, by-product of athletics. Certainly the question 
of keeping the competitive instinct within bounds, in 
the interest alike of social ideals and of nervous 
health; and the further question of educating girls 
to play, first and foremost for the fun of the game, not 
for personal or team honors, are practical problems 
for every teacher of physical education to consider. 
Should Inter-Scholastic Athletics be Encouraged?— 
The above discussion opens the way directly to con- 
sideration of the much-debated question concerning 
the advisability of inter-school or inter-college ath- 
letics for girls. There has developed within the last 
ten years a body of opposition to extra-mural compet- 
itive games so formidable that it bids fair to break 
down the weakening defenses of those physical di- 
rectors who still maintain that such intense competi- 
tive activity is necessary to stimulate girls to undergo 
stiff training in athletics and to keep active their in- 
terest in sports. Dame Experience is notoriously a 
thorough, if somewhat drastic teacher, and she ap- 
pears to have driven home to the minds of a growing 
body of teachers of physical training that inter-col- 
legiate or inter-school athletic contests are attended 
with definite, unpleasant results which appear to be 
somewhat enhanced in the case of girls. In the first 
place the nervous strain of any competitive game is 
tremendously increased when two different schools 
or colleges are pitted against each other. Secondly, 
such competition tends to develop the ‘‘win at any
-P-A-G-E-327
  
HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 317 
cost’’ spirit. In the words of a director of physical 
training of long experience: ‘‘girls show this spirit 
not so much by trying to win by unfair means as by 
using up all of their strength and nerve force, until 
they break down emotionally when the game is lost.’’ 
It may be argued that such emotional instability con- 
stitutes an important reason for educating girls to be 
“good losers’’; but the opposition replies that there is 
ample opportunity to develop this valuable moral 
quality in intra-mural games, where the competitive 
instinct is quite active enough for all practical pur- 
poses. Another criticism of inter-scholastic contests 
has to do with the time and expense involved in travel 
to other localities which alone are regarded by some 
educators as sufficient to condemn the system. As this 
question will be considered later in recording the re- 
plies received to a questionnaire, it will not be dis- 
cussed further at this point. 
Do the Social and Moral Values of Athletics ‘‘ Carry 
Over ’’ into Life Situations?—On the question of the 
social and moral qualities developed by organized 
sports there is a truly impressive unanimity of opinion. 
Team and group loyalty, self-subordination, co-opera- 
tion, sportsmanship in victory and in defeat, fair play, 
courage, perseverance, temperance, and responsibility 
—these are some of the virtues which teachers of 
physical education confidently claim are the much-to- 
be-desired outcomes of intelligently supervised ath- 
letics. And there is solid evidence to support these 
claims when they are restricted to the conditions pre- 
vailing in the gymnasium and on the playing field. 
But when educators categorically declare that these 
desirable social qualities unquestionably ‘‘carry 
 
-P-A-G-E-328
    318 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
over’’ into life situations presenting different ele- 
ments, they at once pass to debatable ground. Such 
a statement as the following seems reasonably open 
to doubt in the light of recent psychological investiga- 
tions into the extent and degree of ‘‘transfer of 
training.’’ 
“Tt is evident that the training obtained through athletics is 
earried over into the business and social life after the girl leaves 
school. Other things being equal, she is ordinarily a fair competitor 
and better citizen. The responsible, reliable player becomes the 
same kind of a citizen, for in games moral energy is stored up and 
habits established which govern the activities in later life. The girl 
who has learned through the experience of games not to do unfair 
things under the stress of competition has had the training which 
enables her to face temptations later in life where the stakes involve 
large interests. ... The girl who was unfair and intemperate in 
games carries these same qualities over into her social or business 
world and everyone who lives or works with her is affected by them. 
The girl who failed to do team work or refused to play games at 
all continues an individualist in her later activities. Whatever is 
acquired of good social and moral qualities is taken into the home 
and tends to raise the home standard and so affects the community 
in a broad way; . . . Modern civilization is complex, strenuous and 
often artificial and our system of education needs organized games 
to prepare the girls for organized life and its activities.” * 
It is quite probable that an overwhelming ma- 
jority of teachers of physical training who read this 
declaration of faith would whole-heartedly agree with 
its professions. On the other hand the educator at 
all familiar with the results of present-day psycho- 
logical experiments is moved to exclaim in the quaint 
words of John Locke: ‘‘I could wish this were said 
with as much Authority of Reason as it is with For- 
wardness of Assurance, and that this [theory] were 
+ Dudley and Kellor, Athletic Games for Women, pp. 37-38. Italics mine.
-P-A-G-E-329
  
HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 319 
established upon good Observation more than old Cus- 
tom.’’ Nothing is easier than to declare with convic- 
tion that the ‘‘responsible, reliable player becomes the 
same kind of citizen, for in games moral energy is 
stored up and habits established which govern the 
activities in later life’’; but such a statement reveals 
an ignorance of contemporary psychology that would 
be mildly amusing if it were not productive of harmful 
results. It is not too much to say that there is 
scarcely a clause in the above quotation that would 
not be qualified or challenged by any reputable psy- 
chologist. If the psychological research of the last two 
decades has served to make anything in the field of 
mental activity reasonably clear, it is this: that mental 
functions or traits are not general in character but 
specific; therefore the training of any mental function 
in one set of circumstances (or with one set of data) 
is no guarantee that the function will work equally well 
in a different situation involving different elements. 
To quote Professor Thorndike: 
“By doubling a boy’s reasoning power in arithmetical problems we 
do not double it for formal grammar or chess or economic history 
or theories of evolution. ... The gain of courage in the game of 
football is never equalled by the gain in moral courage or resistance 
to intellectual obstacles.” 
This is not to say that there is no transfer of im- 
provement in function to another set of circumstances, 
but only to ask how much. Psychological experiments 
conducted over a period of twenty years lead expert 
psychologists to the conclusion stated by Thorndike: 
“The very slight amount of variation in the nature of the data 
necessary to affect the efficiency of a function-group makes it fair 
to infer that no change in the data, however slight, is without effect
-P-A-G-E-330
  320 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
on the function. The loss in the efficiency of a function trained 
with certain data, as we pass to data more and more unlike the 
first, makes it fair to infer that there is always a point where the 
loss is complete, a point beyond which the influence of a training 
has not extended. The rapidity of this loss ... makes it fair to 
infer that this point is nearer than has been supposed.” * 
Obviously, when these statements are translated 
into terms of the moral and social training gained 
through athletic sports they mean that, while such 
training is by no means denied, the transfer of im- 
provement from the playing field to the every day sit- 
uations of business, home, social activities, and politics 
involves a loss so great as, in some instances, to make 
the influence of the training negligible. Because a girl 
codperates in team-play there is, unfortunately, no as- 
surance that she will codperate effectively in a move- 
ment to secure better housing conditions for workers, 
or to enforce the civil service regulations, or to provide 
better educational facilities for all children. Because 
she has developed a spirit of fair play in sports is no 
guarantee that she will be fair in business or profes- 
sional competition or in political party strife. To 
repeat, this is not to say that ideals of fair play, 
disinterested team-work, and good sportsmanship in 
winning and losing will not ‘‘ carry over ’’ from the 
athletic field into the widely different circumstances 
of the workshop, the office, the drawing room and the 
political campaign, but only to maintain that there is a 
loss in the efficient functioning of these habits and 
standards directly commensurate with the difference in 
the character of the two situations. Moreover, as Dr.

Mental Function upon the Efficiency of Other Mental Functions.” Psy. Rev., 
8: 250.
-P-A-G-E-331
  
HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 321 
Jesse Williams has pointed out in a recent thoughtful 
article, self-control, self-subordination, fairness, and 
loyalty to the team are learned even in the gymnasium 
and athletic field ‘‘only if the response made to the 
situation is followed by a satisfying state of affairs.”’ 
That is to say, these ideals and habits are acquired 
by individuals only if the officials of the games hold 
up standards of fair play, self-control, etce., and en- 
force them with strict impartiality so that the players 
are not penalized for exhibiting these qualities by 
losing the game. If they are so penalized the psycho- 
logical bond between a provoking situation and the 
desired response is positively weakened, not strength- 
ened.! 
The moral responses which the right-minded 
teacher of physical training seeks to call out may be de- 
veloped into moral and social habits on the playing 
field. But more than this, if these specialized ideals 
are generalized by being applied to social situations 
there will unquestionably be some transfer of these 
ideals into the daily affairs of life. How much de- 
pends upon circumstances. Studies are greatly needed 
of the after lives of men and women, distinguished in 
school and college by their proficiency in athletics, 
with a view to discovering whether these individuals 
were marked above others in their community by their 
self-control, public spirit, and willingness to codperate 
in as well as to lead unpopular causes for the common 
good. 
A Questionnaire on the Physical Education of Girls.? 
—During the year 1921 a questionnaire was sent out 
1“The Education of Emotions enreuen Physical Education,” in Teachers 
College Record, May, 1920, pp. 205- 
See appendix for full ctatisties,  
-P-A-G-E-332
  322 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
to 120 high schools in the larger cities of the country 
and to 100 colleges and universities educating women. 
Replies were received from 44 high schools and 61 
colleges and universities. The findings in detail are 
set forth in an appendix and throw interesting light on 
present conditions and theories in regard to physical 
education for girls. There is surely cause for encour- 
agement in the fact that nearly all the colleges and 
high schools reporting employ a physical director and 
require from one to four years of physical training of 
every girl. Not so heartening, however, is the knowl- 
edge that only one-half of the high schools require 
physical examinations of the girls and a few of these 
examine only selected groups; while considerably over 
half of the high schools reporting do not take the per- 
sonal histories of the girls. The record of the colleges 
is distinctly better in respect to both these points and 
the same holds true of the prescription of remedial 
exercise. Whereas more than five-sixths of the higher 
institutions prescribe these exercises whenever needed, 
or in a limited number of special cases, less than three- 
fourths of the high schools so employ them and nearly 
half of these schools only in a very restricted way. 
Again, with respect to measures for securing painless 
menstruation the colleges make a far better showing 
than the high schools. More than three-fourths of 
the former have adopted approved measures for help- 
ing girls to obtain normal menstruation, while only 
one-third of the high schools are giving attention 
to this matter. And yet the establishment of func- 
tional periodicity upon a healthful basis is, beyond 
question, one of the most serious problems in the 
physical education of adolescent girls and should by 
 
-P-A-G-E-333
  HEALTH AND THE WOMAN 323: 
no means be deferred to the period of college training, 
which only a limited group will ever enjoy. 
When we turn to the question of the instruction of 
girls in sex hygiene the advantage remains markedly 
in favor of the colleges and universities. This differ- 
ence may partly be explained by the fact that the high 
schools are wholly public institutions, while the col- 
leges are not. The conservative attitude of the great 
body of our middle class toward the removal of the 
taboo upon intelligent discussion of sex questions 
needs only passing reference. Yet, it may be said, 
the ban is being lifted in state universities supported 
by public funds. This greater liberality of attitude 
in our higher institutions of learning is probably due 
to the fact that the parents who send girls to college 
are themselves more enlightened and progressive than 
the majority of middle class men and women. More- 
over, the girls are more mature and doubtless parents 
feel that sex knowledge will not be so likely to shock 
their sensibilities or engross their thoughts. But 
whatever the explanation of the disparity, the injustice 
involved in withholding from girls of high school age 
enlightened sex instruction and guidance at a time 
when they need it probably more than in any subse- 
quent period of their lives, is undeniable and is a 
signal instance of the short-sightedness of educators 
and of the public. 
It is interesting to note that a large majority of 
high schools and colleges believe that girls’ athletics 
should not be identical with men’s. Indeed only one 
university and one high school favor the use of men’s 
athletics without adaptation. Not so nearly unani- 
mous, however, is the disapproval of inter-scholastic 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  324 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
sports for girls, although many schools and colleges 
advocate such games only under careful regulation 
and oversight. The general belief in the transfer of 
moral training from the gymnasium and playing field 
to the varied and different situations of business and 
social life is difficult to explain if physical directors 
are well informed in current psychology. Certainly 
the replies revealed clearly enough that the belief is 
grounded largely on opinion and a limited experience, 
since no director stated that she was using a careful 
plan of ‘‘follow up’’ work with her students. 
The results of the questionnaire, limited in scope 
as the investigation admittedly was, have some value 
as evidence that our colleges and universities, at least, 
have awakened to the necessity of a broadly conceived 
policy of physical education for women—a policy that 
shall provide not only for muscular development but 
for the upbuilding of hygienic habits, the removal, so 
far as possible, of bodily defects and disabilities, the 
equipment of the woman with sex knowledge and 
ideals, and the development of standards of sports- 
manship. So far as it goes, the questionnaire further 
reveals how far the high schools lag behind the col- 
leges in respect to breadth of policy and degree of 
accomplishment in the physical education of girls.

CHAPTER X 
VALUES IN EDUCATION 
Significance of the Term ‘‘ Value.’’—The educational 
literature of the present age—of which, be it said, 
there is no dearth—abounds in references to educa- 
tional values. But these are too often conceived as 
goods external to the self and therefore to be con~ 
sciously striven for as the objective goals of education. 
In this sense writers discourse of social efficiency, 
discriminating enjoyment of literature, esthetic ap- 
preciation, as ends or values existing apart from the 
individual learners and won only by serious applica- 
tion and sustained effort along the paths marked out 
by the schools. This conception of values lays itself 
open to the criticism that it substitutes ‘‘pompous and 
sonorous generalities’’ for intimate personal experi- 
ences—an error by no means confined to education. 
Yet a few moments’ thought would convince any in~ 
telligent person that a value does not exist except as 
some one’s appreciation of good. Enjoyment of fine 
art, for example, cannot be attained merely by setting 
it up as an essential ingredient of culture to be ac- 
quired by diligent practice in drawing and painting. 
It is idle to discourse to girls about esthetic and 
moral worths and their primary importance in a lib- 
eral education, unless these can be translated into per- 
sonal appreciations of value, in other words into the 
326 
 
-P-A-G-E-337
VALUES IN EDUCATION 327 
enhancement of the individual life, emotionally and 
intellectually. The student does, to be sure, sooner or 
later acquire the notion that educated people set the 
stamp of approval upon these appreciations and that 
they are indispensable elements in that vague thing 
called ‘‘culture.’’? Therefore, if she is docile and 
amenable, she will seek to add them to her educational 
stock in hand. But, if the early experiences of this 
girl have been gained in a home where crude and bril- 
liant lithographs and Rogers statuettes set the stand- 
ard of fine arts, and if she has actually come to prize 
these as giving her enjoyable feelings and ideas, she 
will, in spontaneous moments, turn from her artificial 
school standards to those things which she really ap- 
preciates. How to transform mere concepts of value 
into living appreciations, deepening and broadening 
the meaning and intensity of life, becomes, then, one 
of the paramount problems of education. And the 
way out would seem to lie, as Professor Dewey has 
so convincingly shown, in providing a variety of di- 
rect experiences of art, literature, music, intellectual 
activity, moral and social relationships, from which 
girls and boys may get a ‘‘realizing sense’’ of the 
values inhering in them! ? 
Values in Social Life.—Direct experiencing of the 
things worth while in life has, obviously, social as 
well as individual significance. Among the divers 
values on life’s well-spread table, each age and race 
has tended to select one or two as. peculiarly de- 
sirable and satisfying. To the ancient Greeks Reason 
1See Dewey’s Democracy and Education, Ch. XVIII. The writer gladly 
acknowledges her profound indebtedness to America’s leading educational 
philosopher for many of the vantage points from which this subject is 
viewed.  
-P-A-G-E-338
    328 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
and Beauty appealed as of supreme worth; and rarely 
has any people experienced so deeply the enrichment 
and quickening of life that inhere in the pursuit of 
these ideal ends. The Middle Ages seized upon inti- 
mate, personal appreciation of God as the crowning 
human value, beside which love, reason, and beauty 
paled into significance. Our own period is, of course, 
conspicuous for the worth it attaches to material pos- 
sessions together with mastery of natural things and 
forces. But each epoch of history, in selecting its 
special values, has not wholly ignored the other goods 
of life. It has merely relegated them to subordinate 
positions in an ordered scheme of human worths, each 
occupying a separate domain. Thus the diversity of 
values that in combination would make a rich and 
satisfying life have been deprived of the reinforce- 
ment that would come from vital relationship to other 
ends. The result has been that few if any people 
have ‘‘seen life steadily and seen it whole.’’ Seizing 
the cup of some one good to drain it to the dregs, each 
epoch has also sought—sometimes doubtfully, some- 
times almost guiltily—to savor other appreciations. 
The loss to the age and to the individual of this rigid 
demarcation of human values is seen to be two-fold. 
First, it has meant that certain experiences, laden 
with emotional and intellectual satisfactions, have been 
but superficially enjoyed, if at all; further, it has re- 
acted unfortunately upon the values selected as having 
greatest worth. The Greek love of reason led them to 
enter the temple of science with inquiring minds. But 
their scorn of manual labor, their abiding contempt 
for material interests, was the chief cause of their 
small achievements in science and their feeble appre-
-P-A-G-E-339
VALUES IN EDUCATION 329 
ciation of the rewards that come through methodized 
scientific discovery. Likewise, the Middle Ages, in 
elevating religious contemplation and ecstasy into a 
unique place in the scheme of values, struck a deadly 
blow at its vitality. Not only did religion fail to min- 
ister to life in its political and economic aspects, but, 
with the dawn of new scientific interests, its isolation 
from these living currents of social experience de- 
prived it of the nourishment essential to its growth. 
With the hewing out of a new tool of scientific method 
and the spread of the critical attitude of mind, the 
dogmatic religion of the Middle Ages, bitterly hostile 
as it was to this new realm of knowledge, received a 
staggering blow from which it has never recovered. 
But the division of social life into sharply defined 
interests, with the consequent pigeonholing of values, 
is not confined to the ancients. History presents no 
period in which the fencing off of the various vital 
concerns of mankind, each bearing its own peculiar 
good, has been so thoroughly carried out as in the 
present. Although the Greeks left all economic affairs 
to slaves and artisans, the free citizens of Athens ex- 
perienced a fullness and diversity of life rarely if ever 
approximated by any other people. Few nations have 
understood so well how to interpenetrate daily living 
with a wealth of values each playing into and reinfore- 
ing the others. Thus physical training was made to 
serve not health alone but esthetic, civic, moral, and 
religious ends. So with esthetic and intellectual 
worths. Through their intimate relation to the con- 
cerns of active civic life, they were vastly stimulated 
and enriched. Again in the later Middle Ages the 
infusion of religious values into art, architecture, and
-P-A-G-E-340
  330 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
the intellectual activity centered in universities 
brought about, for a time at least, an enhancement not 
only of these interests but of religion itself. But in 
this industrial age we have effected so hard and fast a 
division of human concerns that each interest tends 
to be relegated to its own restricted domain and effec- 
tually prevented from encroaching upon the territory 
of the others. Witness the exclusion of art, social 
values, and religion from the field of business and in- 
dustry. The result is a crude, almost. brutal ma- 
terialism revealing itself in quantity production de- 
void of beauty; in the ruthless greed for power and 
wealth of our captains of industry; in the hard lives, 
empty of well-nigh all that makes life worthy, led by 
millions of laborers; in the ugly slums, a silent refu- 
tation of our professions of democracy. Witness again 
the almost complete divorce of critical inquiry from 
morals and mores, of humane social philosophy from 
political life. Politics, business, art, science, religion, 
social intercourse—each goes its way and achieves its 
limited values largely unassisted by the others. 
Values in Education.—This pigeonholing of the 
varied interests of human beings, so that the contribu- 
tion of each to the other is merely ‘‘external’’ and 
“‘accidental,’’ has been vigorously pointed out by Pro- 
fessor Dewey.1 Very clearly, also, has he shown the 
reaction of the social situation upon education. In the 
course of historical evolution mankind has accumulated 
a fund of knowledge, skill, and values concerned with 
the diversified experiences of life. These have been 
logically organized into studies and are supposed to 
subserve all the desirable ends that the liberally edu- 
1 Democracy and Hducation, pp. 290-91,
-P-A-G-E-341
VALUES IN EDUCATION 331 
cated man or woman should achieve. But the division 
of social experience into separate realms, each with its 
own good, has borne fruit in the division of individual 
experience in the school into rigidly separated studies, 
serving different ends and embracing different values. 
Mathematics, for example, has its own educative 
worths, not to be related to those inhering in geogra- 
phy, history, literature, the social sciences, and morals. 
To be sure, where the relationship between knowledges 
has been impossible to ignore the connection has been 
made, as in the case of mathematics and the exact sci- 
ences, and geography and history. But these are ex- 
ceptional instances. The consequence of this fencing 
off of studies from each other has been precisely the 
same in education as in social life. School physics and 
chemistry, for example, tend to remain just physics 
and chemistry, consisting of organized bodies of facts, 
“‘laws’’ and theories, and of laboratory experiments 
for testing the same, but not related, except at a few 
points, with each other and above all with the problems 
of community living. The humanizing of these studies 
that would follow from their intimate union with eco- 
nomics and industry not to mention literature, would 
vastly enhance their own values. Again the con- 
nection of the study of ethics with economics, social 
and political theory, science and vocational training, 
would immeasurably increase its subjective worth and 
reveal its blood-relationship with other phases of life 
and thought. 
If the rich values of life are to be brought home to 
our girls, then, two outstanding needs in the education 
of the present must be met: (1) the direct, personal 
experiencing of the worths inhering im the various 
 
-P-A-G-E-342
  332 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
studies; (2) the breaking down of the barriers built 
up between the subjects themselves and between them 
and daily living. To accomplish these reforms, how- 
ever, would require a root and branch reorganization 
of education. It would mean that schoolrooms would 
become places where live experiences were obtained 
by boys and girls—experiences affording ample op- 
portunities for bodily activity in the working out of 
projects framed by the students, not the teachers. In 
the course of these activities satisfying values would 
be personally felt—intellectual values in the solution 
of problems, emotional values in familiar acquain- 
tance with great music, art, and literature, as well as 
with the joys of social give and take; efficiency values 
in actually doing things, in carrying forward plans to 
more or less successful conclusions. In such vital ex- 
periences studies would find their place as means to 
further the desired end; and their living relationship 
to each other and to the social life of the present would 
be woven into the very structure of the mental life of 
young women. Then would disappear the prevailing 
tendency to make of studies a dull routine of efficiency 
in speaking and writing, a tendency that has reduced 
educational values to pallid and shrivelled things. 
But if education is to make the enhancement of life 
through the development of fine and true appreciations 
one of its chief tasks it is clear that this cannot be 
successfully accomplished merely by transforming 
schools into places where active experiences with per- 
sons and things are going on. The quickening of the 
imagination of girls by helping them to experience the 
full reach of intellectual and emotional possibilities in 
any educational situation is of paramount impor-
-P-A-G-E-343
  VALUES IN EDUCATION 333 
tance. Thus, in the study of history and literature, 
opportunities for dramatization of significant events 
in the life of nations should be encouraged, together 
with appreciative reading of portions of their great 
literature, and sympathetic study of their art—not by 
means of text-books, but through the medium of photo- 
graphs, screen pictures, and visits to art museums. To 
surround girls in the school-room with reproductions 
of noble art and to encourage them to add to these art 
forms others paid for by their own codperative efforts 
has been proven a good method of stirring an un- 
feigned interest in art—the first step toward its sound 
appreciation. All this of course implies that the 
teacher shall be herself capable of an intimate and vivid 
imagining of all the possibilities for growth in a sub- 
ject, so that children may be helped to experience the 
various intellectual, esthetic, or moral values that 
may inhere init. The widespread educational practice 
of restricting appeals to imagination to the early years 
of school, while in the later period stress is laid only 
upon memory, logical thought, and technical skill, is a 
primary cause of the poverty of imagination and hence 
poverty of inner experience so characteristic of adults. 
To achieve a life abounding in significance requires the 
free play of imagination in extracting a wider range 
of meaning and value from experience than appears to 
the eye of sense. To accomplish this with the indi- 
vidual is to educate personality. 
Appreciation of values is, of course, intimately re- 
lated to the forming of standards. No one can have 
the mental satisfaction of successful thinking through 
a baffling problem, the intelligent enjoyment of a 
noble painting, the construction of a useful or beautiful 
 
-P-A-G-E-344
  334 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
object, without unconsciously forming standards of 
intelligent thinking, of artistic design, of efficient fabri- 
cation. Hence the path of direct, personal appreciat- 
ing is the only road to the development of sincere stand- 
ards. The attempts of teachers to make short cuts to 
the desired ends by talking about the value and im- 
portance of moral virtues, unbiassed thinking, enjoy- 
ment of beauty, enlightened public spirit, ete., result 
chiefly in making students insincere by encouraging 
them ostensibly to adopt standards whose values are 
not perceived because they have never been personally 
experienced. 
Technical vs. Liberal Studies.—Following the de- 
velopment of science and its application to industry, 
new regions of economic and social endeavor have been 
opened up and a formidable array of new studies has 
been added to the curriculum of our higher schools. 
The advent of these technical courses, such as biologi- 
cal analysis, industrial chemistry, and dietetics has 
brought about a lively controversy centering about the 
question of the relative educational values of these 
studies and the old liberal arts courses. The charge is 
made that technical subjects are merely means to 
manual efficiency; that they are wholly lacking in the 
emotional and intellectual values that inhere in the 
so-called cultural studies. Therefore such worth as 
they possess is solely instrumental, not intrinsic. From 
this point of view the girl who specializes in biological 
chemistry with the purpose of entering a municipal 
laboratory gains no rich and rewarding satisfactions 
from her studies. She is merely acquiring useful in- 
formation and technical skill. The shallowness of such 
a judgment would perhaps be revealed to these critics 
 
-P-A-G-E-345
VALUES IN EDUCATION 335 
could they observe, over a period of time, the labor and 
study of applied scientists such as those who are con- 
ducting experiments in the Rockefeller Institute of 
Medical Research. Gripped by problems of profound 
human significance; their imagination stirred by the 
challenge to formulate hypotheses that will square 
with the facts; enjoying the satisfactions that come 
from intricate and delicate laboratory operations, ex- 
pertly performed; and spurred on by the hope of add- 
ing to man’s control of the conditions of living— 
these men are realizing some of the most gratifying 
experiences of human life. The value of a study can- 
not be determined by the nature of the subject matter 
with which it deals but rather by the range and depth 
of the appreciations it makes possible. With due re- 
gard to methods of presentation, mathematics may be 
more quickening to the imagination and judgment of 
worth than the Homeric epics, and physics than fine 
arts. Home economics may be taught with the em- 
phasis upon the technique of cooking, table arrange- 
ment, and budget making. Or it may be so presented 
to girls that the intimate relation of the home as an 
economic and social unit to analogous agencies in so- 
ciety at large is clearly perceived. Therefore it seems 
inadvisable to make out an ordered scale of subjects, 
according to their potential values, with the technical 
studies carefully relegated to the bottom. Each sub- 
ject, properly pursued, contains its own enjoyable ex- 
periences, even though art, music, and literature are 
peculiarly rich in these values. 
But not only has every subject latent possibilities for 
giving the student a realizing sense of good, it is also 
true that every study has its technical aspects in which 
 
-P-A-G-E-346
  336 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
both teachers and learners may become immersed. The 
technicalities of Greek, in the hands of an unimagina- 
tive teacher, would appear to be no more liberalizing 
per se than those of engineering or household eco- 
nomics. Instructors ignore the fact that these techni- 
eal details are but means to the end of securing freer 
play within the subject and thus bringing about an 
enrichment of experience and understanding. Never- 
theless, although in any subject the husk may be substi- 
tuted for the kernel, it cannot be denied that the 
technical studies are peculiarly prone to this mistake. 
In-an age when the wheels of industry whirl noisily 
and Big Business is enthroned, these subjects may eas- 
ily become mere means to mechanical skill. Indeed the 
tendency so to regard technical studies in schools and 
colleges is clearly marked. This is only to say that the 
education of any period is a pretty faithful mirror of 
its social life. If that life sets high value upon the 
production of material goods and relatively low value 
upon social welfare and the cult of beauty, this atti- 
tude will be reflected in the schools. The divorce of in- 
trinsic values from instrumental, of intelligence from 
idealism, that is daily exemplified in industry and busi- 
ness is tending to repeat itself in education in an undue 
stress laid upon technical efficiency at the expense of 
broad understanding. If the standards of worth in 
society are the accumulation of wealth and the increase 
of brute power over human beings and physical forces, 
the standard of education will tend to become how to 
“get on’? in life in a purely materialistic sense. In 
consequence the technical subjects will be presented in 
a narrow, utilitarian spirit with emphasis on the acqui- 
sition of technique.
-P-A-G-E-347

Neglect of Social Values in Higher Education.— 
As we have seen, the individualizing of personality 
that so often is the outcome of higher education is by 
no means accompanied by an equal degree of socializa- 
tion. Hspecially has this been true of young women 
leaving the college and graduate school after years of 
pleasant academic life during which they have been 
introduced to much ‘‘of the best that has been thought 
and said in the world,’’ and have developed a critical 
intellectual method. In large measure the appeal of 
the faculty of college and university (and this is true 
also of the high school) has been to the intellect, not to 
the social impulses and the ‘‘power to do.’’ In conse- 
quence, higher education has tended to develop in 
young women a growing sense of independence of other 
persons and of the activities and agencies of social liv- 
ing. Every year there are graduated from high schools 
and colleges thousands of young women who are ac- 
tuated by the selfish desire to make a place for them- 
selves in the world, even at the cost of others, or to 
continue their agreeable intellectual pursuits un- 
troubled by the necessities and strivings of their fellow 
beings. It is a striking fact that elementary educa- 
tion is awakening to the importance of developing in 
children a sense of social interdependence and habits of 
social give and take, while high schools and colleges 
are disposed to pass rather lightly over this phase of 
education except in classes in social theory. In con- 
sequence, a rewarding domain of social experience 
with its accompanying values has been but partially 
opened to young women. Probably only a small num- 
ber of the girls who receive high school diplomas or 
bachelor’s degrees have glimpsed the satisfactions 
 
-P-A-G-E-348
  338 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
that spring from working with an organized group for 
an end which serves the public good, or have felt the 
dignity and pathos of human life through coming into 
sympathetic and helpful contact with many types of 
human beings. To deprive young women of these 
experiences is to run the risk that their growth in 
social understanding and sympathy will be perma- 
nently hampered and that they will withdraw into a 
social isolation and a mistaken sense of complete 
independence which may result in the arrest of 
growth—the crystallization of life. The adult 
woman needs a realizing sense of personal social 
dependence as much, if not more, than the growing 
child if she is to attain the full measure of her 
personality. 
Obviously the withdrawal of highly educated women 
from intimate contacts with social life in the interest 
of a purely personal culture entails not only a retarda- 
tion of personal development but also an irreparable 
loss to society. For while these women are absorbed 
in carving out careers or in speculating about intel- 
Jectual theories, practical-minded persons, working 
for their own interests, are at the helm of affairs. In 
the vivid phrase of Professor Dewey: ‘‘While saints 
are engaged in introspection, burly sinners run the 
world.’’ If cultivated women are to follow the ex- 
ample of many well-educated men and retire in disgust 
from the hurly-burly of public life the social waste 
will be appalling. For it is, as has so often been said 
before, precisely the divorce of practical idealism from 
the affairs of daily living that has brought about the 
crude materialism of the present age. It is a truism 
that this evil cannot be cured by withdrawing from its 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
  
VALUES IN EDUCATION 339 
polluting influence but by bringing intelligence, good- 
will, and working ideals to its amelioration. 
Moral and Religious Values.—Little has been said 
specifically about the education of women in appre- 
ciation of moral and religious worths, chiefly because 
the writer finds it difficult to disentangle these from 
the values comprised in a humane social philosophy 
embracing all mankind. It is hard to conceive of any 
moral end, such as brotherly good will, honesty, purity, 
unselfishness, courage, charitable judgment, which was 
not born of a social situation and has not a social ref- 
erence. The woman who really appreciates the pro- 
found meaning and value of a life lived in active help- 
ful communication with others will not need specific 
lessons in the moral virtues. So with religion. The 
departure of Christianity in every age from the social 
gospel of Jesus is too obvious to require more than 
passing comment. Not long ago the ambassador of the 
United States to a European government publicly 
declared that in his opinion ‘‘the hostility of pro- 
fessing Christians to Christianity’’ was the chief cause 
of the disruption and misery of the world that con- 
fronts us on every hand. How to bring back the social 
principles of Jesus Christ into the every-day rela- 
tionships of individuals, states, and nations is the 
supreme task of religion. Beside this great enterprise, 
theological dogmas and ecclesiastical forms recede into 
the dim background of unessential things. 
The Peculiar Contribution of Women to Human 
Values.—The liberal opportunities for higher educa- 
tion afforded women in America and the opening of 
one door after another into the manifold fields of hu- 
man endeavor—economic, political, social, exsthetic,  
-P-A-G-E-350
  340 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
scientific—has caused many thoughtful persons to ask 
whether or no women have a peculiar contribution to 
make to social values. Beyond peradventure they have 
made such contributions in the past. History shows 
that during the later centuries of the Middle Ages it 
was the influence of women that nurtured the gentler 
virtues and emotions of life. They it was who set 
great value on protection of little children and help- 
less women in troubled times of war, on consideration 
for others from which sprang courtesy, on courage and 
endurance in the defense of one’s land and lady, and 
on romantic love as the essential element in sex rela- 
tions. Gentleness, courtesy, courage, romance, these 
are values which have been highly prized by civilized 
women in every age. A thirteenth century troubadour 
thus bears witness to women’s influence: 
“There is reason enough why 
We ought to hold women dear; 
For we see happen very little 
Courtesy, except through women. 
Well know I that for the love of ladies, 
The very clowns become courteous.” * 
Social history also makes plain that women have 
been sincere appreciators of poetry, music, and art, 
even though they have as yet created little in these 
fields. Likewise women, confined largely to their 
homes and always occupied with the nurture of little 
children, have had enormous influence in developing 
the domestic virtues of family pride, family loyalty, 
and self-effacing service, together with the quiet joys 
that center about hearth and home. It seems clear, 
then, that women have been preéminent in developing 
1 Wright, Womankind in all Ages of Western Europe, p. 161.
-P-A-G-E-351
  
» VALUES IN EDUCATION 341 
and conserving those values that would tend to make 
family life enduring, peaceful, and enjoyable and to 
secure for little children a good start in life. And by 
thus refining the crude impulses of mankind they have 
rendered an immeasurable social service. 
But it is plain that if women are to enter upon fields 
of endeavor outside the domestic circle they should be 
prepared to add to or enhance the values of life in these 
larger spheres. What have women to contribute in 
business, industry, politics, education, and a variety 
of other social enterprises? This is a searching and 
crucial question. It is quite possible that women, in- 
terested in some chosen occupation, absorbed in its 
problems and details, and desirous of ‘‘making good’’ 
in it, may lose sight of its detachment from art, social 
values, and religion as completely as many men have 
done. There seems not much reason for regarding 
women as more ‘‘moral’’ than men, except in the realm 
of sex and family relations, where it has been in their 
interest to develop and conserve certain values and 
where powerful social pressure has tended to make 
them conform to rigid social standards. Already 
there is some evidence to show that women in busi- 
ness and politics can be quite as self-seeking and un- 
scrupulous, quite as blind to the inhumane phases of 
their vocation, as their husbands and brothers. The 
sooner women get rid of the notion that a peculiar 
moral sanctity hovers about them the sooner will they 
face squarely and honestly the danger of their be- 
coming, like some men, driving machines, deaf to the 
call of beauty, blind to the fundamental rights of 
men and women, pushing ahead ruthlessly to their 
goal of wealth or power or prestige.  
-P-A-G-E-352
  342 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
Nevertheless, while the defects and frailties of wo- 
men should be clearly envisaged, it seems fair to ex- 
press hope—even faith—in those emotional and moral 
qualities in them that have been socially selected 
through many centuries of evolution. Surely it is not 
idle to believe that the greater value most women at- 
tach to human life—which they have borne in agony 
and nurtured in patience—will make itself felt when 
they have entered more actively into the busy marts 
of industry, business, and politics. Although it is 
true that they have already shown themselves capable 
of shrewd and unsocial practices in these fields, it is 
even more apparent that the influence of large organi- 
zations of women, newly enfranchised as they are, is 
being powerfully exerted against the economic exploi- 
tation of human beings, against insanitary conditions 
of living, against the ugliness and vice of great indus- 
trial centers, against the denial of full educational 
opportunities to all the children of our democracy. On 
this humane and nurturing sentiment in women, rising 
almost to a passion in the few, rests much of the world’s 
hope of progress toward more healthful, happy, and 
beautiful living. Speculating on this question of the 
contribution of fully emancipated women to social well- 
being, Professor Thomas says: 
“Tn all our relations there is too much of primitive man’s fight- 
ing instinct and technique; and it is not impossible that the par- 
ticipation of women . . . will contribute new elements, change the 
stress of attention, disturb the equilibrium, and force a crisis which 
will result in the reconstruction of our habits on more sympathetic 
and equitable principles. Certain it is that no civilization can re- 
main the highest if another civilization adds to the intelligence of its 
men the intelligence of its women.”*

VALUES IN EDUCATION 343 
It seems clear enough that if women are to make a 
peculiar gift to the society of the future a heavy re- 
sponsibility rests upon education to cultivate and bring 
to fruition in them their feeling for human life and its 
gentler values without taint of sentimentality. To 
inform the mind richly, to develop sound intellectual 
methods, to open the windows of the soul to esthetic 
and moral beauty—this is not enough. Above all we 
must strive to show the bearing of these values upon 
social life as it is lived to-day in all its repellent ma- 
terialism. For if we train women merely to carry 
forward things as they are, or even to add to the sum 
of dehumanized knowledge and control of natural 
forces, our cultivation will yield Dead Sea fruit. 
Knowledge and power to think and to do—these are 
primary ends of education. But unrelated to what 
Matthew Arnold calls ‘‘the sense for beauty and the 
sense for conduct’’ they easily become instruments for 
the perpetuation of a social order conspicuously de- 
void of beauty and humaneness. A recent contributor 
to the New Republic writes despairingly of the exs- 
thetic and moral ‘‘midnight’’ that the world is facing 
since the war: ‘‘We are suddenly stripped of our 
dreams, left, like a tired-out civilization, without aims 
or beliefs, yet with young life hurrying in us.’’ May 
not the way out of our disillusionment lie in educating 
the young life of the nation—every girl as well as 
every boy—to some form of useful work infused with 
social purpose? This work may be anything from the 
teaching of philosophy to the management of a hospital, 
so it expresses the personality of the worker and af- 
fords chances to work with others for the common 
good. Such a theory is being tried out by Antioch 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  344 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
College in accordance with a plan by which every man 
and woman student will alternate study with practical 
work—five weeks of each. This college believes that 
the salvation of society can come only from the dif- 
fusion of work with active intelligence, broad sym- 
pathy, and willingness to strike out new paths. In 
the words of the Antioch Plan: ‘‘The best cultural 
values are gained not when we escape from industry 
[or any useful occupation] but when we make it ex- 
press our highest purpose.’’ 
The Worthy Use of Leisure. — The meagre apprecia- 
tion our age accords to ideal values is nowhere more 
clearly revealed than in our times of leisure. While 
social writers and educators alike loudly deplore the 
vogue of ‘‘jazz,’’ musical ‘‘revues’’ and the like, they 
do not always trace the thirst for these amusements to 
their sources. These would seem to be first, the strain 
of life in a hurried, mechanized, industrial society, and 
secondly, the empty minds of individuals who seek 
relaxation and enjoyment without ever having been 
educated in knowing where to find them. Educated 
women no less than men flock to the moving picture 
shows, the sensational ‘‘revues,’’ and the tea-dances 
that afford them easy emotional gratification; and an 
appalling amount of time every year is given over to 
these cheap entertainments. This is not to say that 
relaxation and enjoyment are not legitimate and very 
necessary ends, but to point out the almost total ab- 
sence of the finer values from these amusements. It 
is surely a commentary upon the character of educa- 
tion in America that so few people understand ‘‘the 
worthy use of leisure.’? Yet our age is not lacking in 
opportunities for such enjoyment of leisure as shall
-P-A-G-E-355
VALUES IN EDUCATION 345 
at the same time enrich the mind and quicken the finer 
emotions and appreciations. A young woman who is 
not growing, through her avocations and pleasures as 
well as through her chosen work, to a truer apprecia- 
tion of beauty as well as to a broader and more sym- 
pathetic understanding of the mystery, the tragedy, 
the possibilities of human life, is but imperfectly edu- 
cated. Never to have felt the spirit quicken and aspire 
when great artists speak through brush and instru- 
ment and pen; never to have been stirred by ‘‘the mys- 
tic force of communication—the miracle of shared life 
and shared experience,’’ is to be poor indeed. For in 
such case, neither work nor leisure have given to the 
soul the deepest experiences, the most rewarding ap- 
preciations that are its birthright. 
If these values are to be realized by our young 
women, schools and colleges must consciously grapple 
with the problem of how to educate them to a wiser use 
of leisure. Educators have too long ignored this ques- 
tion, shifting the responsibility to the home where it 
has been held to belong. But it is patent to all in- 
terested observers that too many homes are making no 
honest effort to attack the problem, while others are 
not even conscious that one exists. Not rarely it is in 
her own family circle that the girl has acquired the 
taste for cheap and sensational amusements which she 
indulges so extravagantly in school and college. Al- 
though relatively little, perhaps, can be done to im- 
prove her habits of recreation without the codperation 
of her parents, nevertheless teachers and advisers 
should seriously grapple with this question, bringing 
all their intelligence and good will to bear upon it. 
Would it not be possible, by the use of tactful and 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
  346 THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
democratic methods, to bring about in coeducational 
universities and women’s colleges, as well as in high 
schools, the appointment of a committee on recreation 
consisting of members of the faculty and student body? 
This group could then make a study of the existing 
situation with respect to amusements and suggest 
other forms that would provide real enjoyment as well 
as opportunities for growth. Coeducational institu- 
tions especially afford splendid chances for working 
out a program of sane recreation in which the two 
sexes could share. Why not, as Zona Gale suggests, 
try to develop in our young people ‘‘an intelligent 
attitude toward drama’’; why not help them to enjoy 
presenting worth-while classic and modern plays, to 
take part in pageantry, folk-dancing, musical eve- 
nings? If the committee were inspired by a sense of 
the high importance of its task, if it were imaginative 
enough to frame plans appealing to young people and 
eloquent enough to fire students with something of its 
own enthusiasm, much might be done to raise young 
people’s standards of recreation. Since evils do not 
cure themselves, these standards will remain crude 
and unworthy until the problem is thoughtfully 
analyzed into its component factors, a tentative plan 
of action formulated and a courageous attempt made 
to apply this plan to the situation with a view to 
modifying it in the light of its results. Because the 
coeducational universities furnish more normal social 
conditions with respect to recreation than the separate 
colleges for women it is earnestly to be hoped that 
they will be in the vanguard of the movement for its 
betterment. 
General Summary.—An attempt has been made in
-P-A-G-E-357
VALUES IN EDUCATION 347 
this chapter to suggest certain fundamental ideas 
which should govern the efforts of educators to en- 
hance the personal standards and values of every girl. 
But the education of personality which this implies 
cannot be accomplished save in a vital social medium, 
rich in those esthetic, intellectual, and spiritual values 
that should be individually realized by every woman. 
This is only to restate a position that has appeared 
again and again in the discussion of various phases of 
the education of women. To say that the culture of 
personality, the liberation of individual powers, is the 
supreme end of education is to state only a half 
truth; its complement is the fact that this cultivation 
cannot reach full fruition in isolation—partial or com- 
plete—from the living currents of social life about us. 
If this dual principle be accepted, its fair-minded ap- 
plication to existing educational institutions for women 
must result in their indictment on several counts. In 
the first place the full and free development of the in- 
dividuality of young women is too often subordinated 
to conventional conceptions of what women are and 
what they ought to contribute to society. As we 
have seen, the prevailing theory that ‘‘ Woman ’’ rep- 
resents an easily recognizable domestic type, together 
with the firm conviction-that her best work for the 
world can only be done in the home as at present or- 
ganized, are responsible for the attempts of educators 
to differentiate the education of women from that of 
men. Furthermore, it is answerable for the outcry 
against the higher education of women as the chief or 
only factor in the declining marriage and birth rates 
among educated classes; in the insistence upon the in- 
troduction of compulsory courses in home economics  
-P-A-G-E-358
  348, THE EDUCATION OF WOMEN 
and child care; in the flimsy arguments adduced to 
prove that the mental make-up of women is rigidly 
determined by sex and is designed by nature for the 
functions of ‘‘consumption”’’ and appreciation—not for 
creative work. Thus the great end of the liberation of 
personality for self-expressive work of social utility 
has been more dimly perceived and less effectually 
attained in the case of women than in that of men. 
But this is not all. The failure of educational in- 
stitutions for women to envisage the truth that free 
personality cannot attain fruition in an atmosphere 
of academic aloofness from the concerns of every-day 
social life is responsible for certain other defects in 
contemporary educational practice. It has reinforced 
the historic conception of ‘‘culture’’ as a priceless 
personal possession having nothing to do with the 
work-a-day world and its merely material interests. 
This, of course, has led to the almost complete exclu- 
sion from liberal arts colleges for women of courses in 
the great vocational fields and, further, to the refusal 
so to present subjects having a vocational bearing that 
their practical applications might be fully understood 
by the students. On the other hand the severance of 
education for leisure from education for work has 
borne fruit in a type of vocational training for girls 
of the laboring class (so far as this training has been 
provided at all) which is illiberally conceived as con- 
sisting mainly in acquiring technical skills having im- 
mediate market value. Quite as important as the in- 
fusion of liberal education with social purpose is the 
emancipation of vocational education from the domi- 
nance of a cramping conception of its end. 
The withdrawal of high schools and colleges from
-P-A-G-E-359
  VALUES IN EDUCATION 349 
community affairs into an intellectual atmosphere of 
their own making is further responsible for their neg- 
lect of the social values in education. As we have seen, 
educational institutions in the past, and to a consid- 
erable extent in the present, ignore the fact that young 
women must live in a world of unsatisfactory social 
adjustments giving rise to live social problems. A 
purely theoretical education tends to develop in young 
people a false conception of knowledge as an end in 
itself or as a means to forging ahead in life without 
too much regard for one’s fellows. In consequence, 
our towns and cities harbor too many young women 
struggling to hold their own in a sharp competitive 
struggle, unenlightened in social outlook, and unre- 
sponsive to the call of social movements. Further- 
more the failure of the home and the school, working 
together, to make an intelligent and sympathetic study 
of the ‘‘new girl,’’ emerging in this transitional period 
in all her crudity and self-assertiveness, must be held 
chiefly accountable for the ‘‘flapper’’ in our midst—a 
type by no means restricted to the period of early ado- 
lescence. Here, again, the prevalent idea that educa- 
tion is primarily concerned with training the intellect 
and imparting information bears the onus of responsi- 
bility for this state of affairs. Finally, the attempt to 
educate girls to an appreciation of the finer values of 
life apart from concrete experiences embodying these 
values has resulted in too many instances, as this 
chapter has sought to make plain, in a merely con- 
ventional and insincere acceptance of the standards 
prized by cultivated people. 
But this study of outstanding issues in the education 
of women may not properly close with words of adverse

criticism and warning. The future of the education 
of women in America is big with hope and promise. 
It is the author’s belief that the widening of oppor- 
tunities for women, both educational and social, the 
gradual breaking down of the traditional concep- 
tions of woman’s nature and woman’s sphere, will 
proceed without serious hindrance. Unquestionably, 
however, the movement could be hastened as well as 
more intelligently directed were individuals imme- 
diately interested in women’s education to examine in 
a critical spirit their own educational philosophy re- 
specting the larger purposes, the procedures and the 
available means in the education of women to enable 
them to play a larger and more useful part in the life 
of the twentieth century.

Of the three higher institutions replying in the negative, 
one stated that the university was preparing to introduce 
physical education; another reported that the work was in 
charge of the Y.W-C.A. Of the four high schools reporting 
no physical director, one declared that what ‘‘work is done 
is supervised by the director of physical education of the 
school system.’’ Another wrote that a class-room teacher was 
in charge of the girls’ physical training. A third stated that 
there would be a physical director when the school removed 
to its new building.

It will be seen that slightly over one-half the colleges and 
universities require physical education of only Freshmen and 
Sophomores, while nearly one-fourth require the work of all 
women students. Two institutions in the latter group, how- 
ever, stated that Saturday students and Senior and Junior 
day students are exempted from the physical training required 
of all resident women. Of the high schools, one (not listed 
above) reported that 30 minutes daily is given to physical ex- 
ercises in the fall and spring, under student leadership, but 
failed to state whether such exercises are required of all 
students. The high school which requires one semester’s 
physical education for graduation reported that credit is given 
for the work during the entire four years. 
Question III. How much training is required? 
The great majority of the colleges and universities reported 
that two hours (or periods) weekly were required. Five in- 
stitutions require 3 periods weekly; five require 4 periods 
weekly ; one requires 3 periods weekly of Freshmen and 2 of 
the remaining three classes; one requires 3 periods weekly for 
two years and 2 periods for the third year; and one requires 2 
periods weekly for the first three years, offering 1 period 
weekly of optional work to Seniors. Several colleges men- 
 
-P-A-G-E-363
  APPENDIX 353 
tioned the fact that walking was required of all students, and 
one college stated that 5 hours of exercise weekly, including 
walking, was required. 
The time required for physical training in high schools 
varies greatly from 40 minutes weekly in the case of one 
school to 150 minutes weekly in one other school. One school 
requires 45 minutes “‘three or four times weekly’’; another re- 
quires 3 periods weekly ; another only one period weekly. But, 
as in the case of the colleges and‘universities, most of the high 
schools reported a requirement of two periods weekly, varying 
in length from 40 to 70 minutes.

satisfactory enough to warrant students in asking to take 
corrective work; somewhat varying, but encouraging; fair in 
some cases, excellent in others; work well worth while—I do 
not see how we could do without it here where physical edu- 
cation is required; results depend on the girl; recently begun 
and some good results already; fairly good, depending on 
the degree of interest and codperation that can be got; usually 
helpful in menstrual difficulties and slight curvature and pos- 
tural defects; results of setting up exercises are noticeably 
good ; good in a large number of cases, but not always striking 
or permanent; no time to do the work so as to get noticeable 
results.’’ 
As will be noted, a large number of high schools did not 
reply to the question concerning results. A few qualified 
answers follow: Results not very good—girls do not grasp 
the importance of the exercises and only do them under super- 
vision ; difficult to estimate; results particularly good in cases 
of flat feet and underweight; segregated groups too large for 
eareful individual prescription; in some of our schools where 
we are equipped for this work we are securing very good 
results; some good results have been obtained; have just 
started work of this kind this winter so cannot judge results.

The reports of the colleges and universities concerning the 
remedial measures taken show that the problem of painful 
menstruation is being attacked very generally and with in- 
telligence. Fifteen higher institutions stated that Dr. Mosher’s 
exercises were being used; seven referred to lectures, instru:-
-P-A-G-E-367
APPENDIX 357 
tion or ‘‘advice’’ on general hygienic measures and two re- 
ferred to regulation of general hygiene in the inter-menstrual 
period; sixteen institutions stated that special remedial exer- 
cises were given, especially mat exercises (in a reclining pos- 
ture), exercise of the abdominal muscles, breathing exercises 
and massage; seven declared that menstrual sufferers were 
placed in special classes for remedial work; two stated that 
corrective exercises were prescribed to be done at home as 
well as in college; two referred to special advice given by the 
college physician when needed; three mentioned that in ex- 
treme cases a pelvic examination by the resident physician was 
recommended. 
A few of the replies are worth repeating in detail. One 
eastern woman’s college reported that a record of general 
hygiene is taken and the source of the difficulty discovered if 
possible. Work is given for posture and feet where such 
faults are discovered. Emphasis is placed on abdominal and 
breathing exercises and home exercises are prescribed. Advice 
is also given as to the matters of diet, rest, ete. Another reply 
contains the following statement which will no doubt be cor- 
dially endorsed by college instructors and deans of women: 
“*T believe loss of sleep, lack of exercise, constipation, and 
nervous tension are the usual causes of dysmenorrhea in the 
college girl.’’ A third reply stated that the remedial measures 
used include exercises under supervision and ‘‘modification 
of habits of sleep, study, etc. The latter are to be reported 
on weekly to the instructor in physical education and the 
grade in that subject is dependent on the results.’’ (Italics 
mine.) 
Such high schools as reported in detail on remedial meas- 
ures use much the same methods as the colleges, although none 
referred to Dr. Mosher’s exercises as a corrective. One school 
reports that special exercises are taught in all physical edu- 
cation classes. Also attempts are made to relieve abdominal 
congestion by strengthening the abdominal muscles, reducing 
constipation, securing proper rest and keeping warm. An- 
 
-P-A-G-E-368
  
358 APPENDIX 
other high school states that a consistent attempt is made to 
build up muscular tone by explaining it to the girls and 
“creating the desire to have and to hold this panacea for 
manifold ills.’’ Likewise the girls are encouraged to get the 
habit of being active. 
Question VIII. Are girls excused from physical training 
during menstruation? If not, what method is employed for 
partial exemption? Do you approve Dr, Arnold’s plan of 
encouraging healthy girls to continue physical training exer- 
cises much as usual during menstruation? Why? 
The replies received to the first question follow:

It will be seen that nearly all the colleges and universities 
excuse students from physical education during a portion of 
the menstrual period. The time during which they are re- 
leased from floor work varies from one day to three days. Cer- 
tain universities, however, are clearly experimenting with 
the plan of encouraging girls to take the less strenuous forms 
of exercise during the entire period of menstruation. In this 
connection it seems worth while to quote replies received from 
two large western universities. 
One university writes: ‘‘Every girl is required to report 
in uniform. Those menstruating given special work. This 
plan works splendidly and I highly recommend it.’’ Another 
reports: ‘‘Our rule is as follows: Girls may on the first day 
of menstruation report at the rest room and rest during that 
hour. Girls are encouraged to come to class if possible but to 
eliminate running and jumping. Our idea is that the hour of
-P-A-G-E-369
APPENDIX 359 
Physical Education is primarily a healthful hour and whether 
the girl should exercise or rest depends upon the individual. 
These plans have been very successful.’’ 
With respect to approval or disapproval of Dr. Arnold’s 
plan the replies may be grouped as follows:

Of the higher institutions favoring Dr. Arnold’s plan one 
writes: ‘‘I do approve Dr. Arnold’s plan because girls are 
much too apt to pamper themselves in this respect.’’ Of 
those disapproving the plan one university writes: ‘‘I do not 
approve Dr. Arnold’s plan. There seems to me to be too 
much of a risk that directors of Physical Education have no 
right to assume. The real harm may come years afterward. 
I doubt if he has ‘followed up’ his students for any length 
of time after they have left his school.’’ Of the high schools 
which approve the plan one writes: ‘‘Yes. It is a natural 
function and after school days many will have to perform 
their daily work regardless of menstruation.’’? Conditional 
approval is given to the plan by a high school in the South: 
“*T believe that healthy girls should, as they progress in train- 
ing and in hygienic living, be encouraged to shorten the 
‘exemption’ period, but with due regard to the kind and ex- 
tent of physical activities to be practiced. I should eliminate 
jumping and vigorous exercises and apparatus work because 
of the extra weight of the uterus and therefore danger of a 
ptosis. Exercises of endurance should be avoided because they 
increase breakdown of tissue in genital organs. Under health- 
ful conditions the menstrual period should not be one of 
semi-invalidism.’’

Question X. What methods are employed? Are the re- 
sults satisfying? 
By far the greater number of colleges and universities re- 
port that lectures in sex hygiene are given in connection with 
a course in ‘‘general’’ or ‘‘personal’’ hygiene usually re- 
quired of Freshmen. Special lectures by a physician—resi- 
dent or visiting—are mentioned by eleven colleges and uni- 
versities, but only two state whether or no attendance is 
compulsory. In a few instances these lectures are given by 
the Director of Physical Education and in two cases by the 
Dean of Women. One university states that reproduction is 
discussed in an elective course in biology and physiology; a 
southern university declares that special attention is given 
to sex hygiene in a course under the instruction of the Physical 
Director. The course consists of lectures, discussions, and 
research work. Two colleges report that sex instruction is 
given in connection with physiology or anatomy courses; three 
others that it is taught in connection with a laboratory course 
in biology. One college contents itself with assigning to 
seniors certain readings in sex hygiene to be reported upon. 
The method used by the sixteen high schools which give 
instruction in sex hygiene do not differ greatly from those of 
the colleges. Lessons in personal hygiene or physiology fur- 
nish the opportunity for sex instruction in most cases. One 
school reports that the anatomy, physiology, and hygiene of 
sex organs and the psychology of adolescence and puberty are
-P-A-G-E-371
  
APPENDIX 361 
taught in connection with lessons in biology and in informal 
talks. Such instruction is incidental to work in the develop- 
ment of animal and plant series, which stresses progress due 
to sexual methods of reproduction. One large city system re- 
ports that health talks are being given in the high schools 
where the subject of sex is ‘‘not taboo.’’ An eastern city high 
school is offering a course in social hygiene to sophomores, 
given by the social director, and is supplementing this with 
“impromptu talks.’’ 
The sharp disparity in numbers between the high schools 
and the universities and colleges with respect to instruction in 
matters of sex is deplorable but hardly surprising. The Ameri- 
can high schools are controlled by Boards of Education not al- 
ways composed of enlightened individuals and frequently 
dominated by uninformed public opinion. So far as the 
evidence of this questionnaire goes it shows clearly enough 
that a veritable army of young girls is graduating from 
our secondary schools every year having received in school 
no scientific instruction and having been imbued with no 
fine idealism concerning sex relationships. Girls as well 
as boys are left to form their standards on the basis 
of information picked up from the street and the cheap 
novel. 
As to the results secured by the various methods in use 
there is not much evidence to be gleaned from the reports. 
Only one high school replied to the question with the response 
that results were ‘‘ difficult to determine.’’ Among the higher 
institutions there seems considerable divergence of opinion on 
this question. Seven out of the fifteen colleges and univer- 
sities replying to the question stated that the results had been 
satisfactory. Two of these declared that students constantly 
testify to the benefits received. A western state university 
reports the results as ‘‘gratifying’’; while a southern uni- 
versity states that ‘‘the interest and enthusiasm have been 
very satisfying.’’ On the other hand one eastern woman’s 
college reports that results obtained from sex instruction  
-P-A-G-E-372
  362 APPENDIX 
have been ‘‘not very satisfying’’; and two other institutions 
declare that results have been only moderately satisfactory. 
The seven colleges and universities remaining report that 
results are doubtful or that there is no certain method of 
determining them.

It will be noted that an overwhelming majority of the col- 
leges and a large proportion of the high schools which reported 
have gymnasiums for the use of the girls. However, seven of 
the state universities report that women alternate with men 
in the use of the gymnasium; one declares that its gymnasium 
has no equipment; and another states that there are no ade- 
quate dressing-rooms or showers. Several of the eastern wo- 
men’s colleges report that, in addition to the gymnasium or 
gymnasiums, a pool, a fencing room, special exercise rooms, 
a large roof, etc., are provided. Three high schools state that 
girls alternate with boys in the use of the gymnasium; one 
high school reports that part of the students use the corri- 
dors for physical exercise; another that the lobby is used 
for physical culture and there is little apparatus; another 
that the gymnasium is small and it is impossible under present 
conditions to meet the state requirements for anything but 
the class periods per week.

for the use of girls?

Again the higher institutions have a marked advantage over 
the high schools, which are commonly located in the heart of 
bustling cities and can with difficulty secure the necessary 
space for light and air about the building, not to mention ath- 
letic fields. Many high schools report using the city parks 
and public playgrounds; and one school makes use of the 
school yards ‘‘and a near by armory.’’ The universities and 
colleges, on the other hand, have frequently a splendid equip- 
ment for out-of-door games and sports. For example, a west- 
ern university reports that 2 hockey fields (used for baseball 
in the spring), a track, fields for archery, volley ball, and 
tennis courts are provided for the women students. Likewise 
an eastern college for women states that ten sports are open 
to its students,—rowing, golf links, 2 hockey fields, 4 basket 
ball courts, 22 tennis courts, a basketball field, running track, 
2 volley ball fields, an archery court, and a riding oval.

It will be seen that approximately five-sevenths of the higher 
institutions and five-sixths of the high schools reporting do 
not favor the same athletic sports for women as for men. 
The reasons for this wholesale disapproval were chiefly on  
-P-A-G-E-374
  364 APPENDIX 
physiological grounds and because of the excessive nervous 
strain which accompanies competitive sports. In the report 
of an eastern woman’s college the grounds of disapproval 
were summed up as follows: ‘’1, Too much nervous strain; 
2, occupies too much time and attention; 3, requires too 
much concentration on the few at the expense of the many; 
4, professionalizes the sport; 5, interferes with academic 
rank.’’ Several colleges stated that, since they did not ap- 
prove of men’s athletics as carried out at present, they could 
not approve of their adoption for women. The thirteen higher 
institutions favoring modified or adapted athletics for women 
stated, in general, that the same events might be used for 
women as for men but the standards set for the former should 
be lower, and both in strenuousness and length of time the 
events should be modified. One state university reported: 
“The heavy weight throwing, long distance competitive run- 
ning and pole vaulting events have proved injurious to our 
girls, and are eliminated from field day events.’’ The physi- 
eal director in a city university stated that few girls keep up 
athletic work from twelve years on, therefore they are un- 
prepared for strenuous games. She added that she did not 
oppose such sports when a girl was adequately prepared. 
The reasons given by the 35 high schools which disapproved 
of men’s athletics for girls were similar to those advanced 
by the colleges—namely, too great physical and nervous 
strain. Several high schools also referred to the fact that 
girls ‘‘seem to have no judgment about such exercise,’’ play- 
ing in competitive sports at times when they should avoid 
heavy physical exercise. A high school in the South voiced 
its belief that the excitement of heavy athletics seems to ‘‘re- 
duce refinement’’ among the girls taking part. It is interest- 
ing to learn that the physical directors in at least three high 
schools imply, if they do not expressly state, that if girls 
had exercised as freely as boys under similar conditions of 
unrestraint they might be capable of carrying on the same 
athletic sports. Thus a western high school writes: ‘‘Their
-P-A-G-E-375
  
APPENDIX 365 
dress, their training by the time they have reached High 
School, has softened them so that they will be discouraged by 
boy standards and only the tom-boys will turn out.’’ 
Another southern school states that in some communities at 
present girls could not stand boys’ athletics and adds: 
“Physical Training would have to begin earlier. The com- 
munity must be educated to it.’’ 
The third high school suggesting this view is in the Hast. 
The director of physical training writes: ‘‘If girls were al- 
lowed the same freedom from restraint and custom, and given 
similar training, I believe they could do most of the same 
work; but as conditions are and with the monthly period of 
menstruation a factor to figure with, it is better to have some 
difference in the athletics.’’

A glance at the tables shows that slightly over seven-tenths 
of the colleges and exactly one-half of the high schools re- 
porting register their disapproval of competitive sports be- 
tween different schools. The majority of the higher institu- 
tions unite in giving as their reason the intense nervous strain 
and excitement involved in inter-college athletics where the 
element of competition is uppermost. Other reasons assigned 
for disapproval were the professionalizing of sport, the loss 
of time and energy involved, and the fact that the directors 
of sports tend to neglect the many for the few. Certain of 
the replies seem worth quoting in full: 
 
-P-A-G-E-376
  366 APPENDIX 
‘‘The travel involved (in inter-collegiate games with out of town 
teams) is a waste of energy. Involves spending too much time on a 
small group in order to get a ’varsity team and decreased interest for 
those who don’t make the team. We want sports for the largest number 
possible and have not needed interscholastic contests to keep up in- 
terest.’” 
Another college writes: 
*“No, the average girl’s high-strung emotions lead to too many un- 
pleasant consequences all around. Work is a detriment to her both 
physically and mentally and in general fails to encourage the-sake-of-the- 
game feeling. Girls are fully satisfied without.’’ 
And a third: 
‘*No. Temptation to play the best girls always, even when it would 
be wiser for the girl not to play. Tends to make girls aggressive and 
oftentimes too familiar. Proper chaperonage almost impossible because 
team seldom stays together in same boarding and sleeping place.’’ 
The reasons offered by the high schools for their dissatis- 
faction with inter-scholastic sports were much the same as 
those expressed by the colleges. One school writes: 
“No. Danger from over-training because of emphasis that will 
always be placed on winning in inter-scholastie sports. It encourages 
the fighting rather than the sporting spirit. Group loyalty, codperation, 
fairness, etc., can be developed through intra-school competition which 
can be more strictly supervised.’ 
A large number of schools and colleges were in agreement 
with the theory expressed above in regard to intra-mural 
sports. These were declared to be productive of most of the 
desirable results attributed to inter-school athletic contests 
while largely eliminating the undesirable effects. On the other 
hand, 6 colleges and 9 high schools went on record as ap- 
proving of inter-scholastie sports. The chief reason for 
such approval seemed to be the encouragement of school and 
class spirit which resulted. Two colleges expressed their 
approval as follows: 
**Yes. To teach girls to meet rivals in the proper spirit, to teach 
them that there is more in school sports than winning or losing.’’ 
**Yes. Of course the nervous strain is undesirable, but the poise 
and control necessary and evident should be of value to a person in 
other experiences in life. Women should be developed along lines of 
sportsmanship, fair play, ete. Already vast strides have been made in 
this respect, I think.’’
-P-A-G-E-377
APPENDIX 367 
So with the 9 high schools approving. One school in New 
England writes: 
‘*Yes, if properly supervised. Creates more enthusiasm, gives the girl 
something to work for. I believe the High School girl needs the stimulus 
to spur her on because she is self-conscious. The child will play of 
her own accord.’’ 
The colleges and schools which conditionally approved of 
inter-scholastic sports all emphasized the importance of 
proper regulation and supervision. One school registers its 
approval ‘‘within limits’’ and adds: ‘‘Properly controlled 
and with girls well trained mentally it has proved inspiring.’’ 
These reports would indicate that the success or failure of 
inter-scholastic athletics rest largely with the coach and referee 
and depend upon their ability to supervise with strictness and 
fairness and to develop in girls standards of self-control and 
sportsmanship. 
Question XV. Do you believe that the habits and ideals 
developed in physical education ‘‘carry over’’ into life situa- 
tions? What is the evidence?

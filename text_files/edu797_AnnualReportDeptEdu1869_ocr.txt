REPORT 
  
Tue ORegANIZATION of free schools for the universal education 
of the people, has, by Divine favor, been effected in Tennessee. ° 
This office was opened October 7th, 1867. The revised school law . 
establishing it, was passed March 5th, 1867. 
Tt required :— 
1st. On the first Saturday of June, 1867, the election of the 
School Directors in each Civil District. 
2nd. Various duties of Directors, among them, the taking be- 
tween the first and third Mondays of May, of an enumeration of - 
all the white and colored youths, between the ages of six and 
twenty, resident within the District. 
8rd. Specifically they should report the scholastic population so 
taken, to the County Superintendent, on or before the first day of 
September. 
4th. The organization of a Civil District Board of Directors. 
5th. The Civil District Directors, among other duties, were to . 
hold regular sessions on the first Monday of April, and first Monday 
of September. 
6th. School-houses were to be procured, and schools opencd for 
black and white separately, throughout the State, and reports made 
by Clerks to County Superintendents, and by these to the State 
Superintendent, of all facts as provided by law, and required by him. 
Tth. A State Superintendent was to be elected at the regular 
election in August, 1867 ; and until his election, and entering upon 
his duties, a State Superintendent was to be supplied by the ap- 
pointment of the Governor and with the approval of the Senate. 
8th, The State Superintendent, was to appoint a Superintendent 
for each County, to serve till the election provided for in the County. 
9th. The State was to levy a tax largely in advance of the old
-P-A-G-E-6
6 
tax, for school purposes, to be distributed pro rata among the schoo 
children of localities complying with the law. 
10th. Districts were authorized to levy a tax: Ist, To supple- 
ment the State tax for supporting free schools five months, each| 
year. 2nd, For the purpose of paying for school-house sites, and 
building school-houses. 
11th. Various other specifie duties were required of the respect- 
ive school officers. 
Only here and there, had any community complied with any of 
those requirements. Rarely one here had elected Directors, and 
another there had taken the census, or another had attempted to 
get a school-house ready. The State tax, however, provided, had 
been levied, and was already largely collected. Looking back of 
the recent law, which was to be my immediate guide, I found in the 
Constitution of the State, the following strong and emphatic lan- 
guage used in section 10: 
“Knowledge, learning and virtue, being essential to the preservation of repub- 
lican institutions, and the diffusion of the opportunities and advantayes of educa- 
tion throughout the different portions of the State being highly conducive to the 
promotion of thig end, it shall be the duty of the General Assembly, in all future 
periods of this government, to cherish literature and science. And the fund 
called the Common School Fund, and all the lands and proceeds thereof, dividends, 
stocks, and other property of every description whatever, heretofore by law appro- 
priated by the General Assembly of this State for the use of the common schools, 
and all such as shall hereafter be appropriated, shall remain a property fund, the 
principal of which shall never be diminished by Legislative appropriation ; and 
the interest thereof shall be inviolably appropriated to the support and encourage- 
ment of common schools throughout the State, and for the equal benefit of all the 
people thereof; aud no law shall be made authorizing said fund, or any part there- 
of, to be diverted to any other use than the support and encouragement of common 
schools; and it shall be the duty of the General Assembly, to appointa Board of 
Commissioners, for such term of time as they may think proper, who shall have 
the general superintendence of said fund, and who shall make a report of the con- 
dition of the same from time to time, under such rules, regulations and restrictions, 
as may be required by law: Provided, that if at any time hereafter, a division of 
the public lands of the United States, or of the money arising from the sales of 
such lands, shall be made among the individual States, the part of such lands or 
money, coming to this State, shall be devoted to the purposes of education and in- 
ternal improvements, and shall never be applied to any other purpose,” 
The Code contained some twenty pages under the title of “Hdu- 
cation,” of which some sixteen pages related to common schools, 
and embraced the provisions revised by the lag of 1867. 
These provisions of the Code related only to schools for whites, 
’ and made the Treasurer of the State Superintendent of Public In-
-P-A-G-E-7
7 
struction. There had been no Superintendent of the State under 
the new law; therefore, I turned to the Treasurer for reports, but 
found none, neither any records save a bundle of old letters. Seek- 
ing of leading men, prominent in State affairs in the past, I failed 
to find any one who could tell me in detail, exactly how the former 
system operated in its various provisions, from District Commis- 
sioners to State Treasurer. It was apparent that they had no 
report exacted of each officer to the State, of the discharge of his 
responsibilities. ‘ 
The scholastic population was reported to the State, and the 
State Fund for distribution was apportioned and paid out to the 
Trustees of Counties. The State did not know, and could not tell 
whether a dollar was expended as the law required, whether it was 
used for public or private purposes, whether there was a school 
taught or a child taught, or not. These provisions of the Code ap-~ 
peared to have been a dead letter in all respects during the war, 
after the re-organization of the State Government, till the passage of 
the new law. Although legally in force, except so far as the collec- 
tion of the school tax provided for, was concerned, I could not 
learn of the opening of a school under it during those two years. 
This tax, however, had been collected. But the new school law was 
hardly less a dead letter, for the seven months after its passage in 
March, until October, when my labors here commenced ; for nothing 
had been done completely, save to levy a tax, and proceed with its 
collection. : 
Seeking information as I could, in different quarters, in regard to 
a public interest so vast and vital, I met exceedingly diverse ex- 
pression of opinion. The revenue officers of the State assured me 
they had no moneys in the Treasury—that there having been no 
schools in operation to call for the money, it had been, in the States’ 
distress, used like other revenue, to liquidate the indebtedness of 
the State. The Comptroller assured me he could not see how the 
money for school purposes could be spared. 
Others thought the schools should be delayed in their organization 
until the State had reduced its debt, and could conveniently dis- 
burse money for education; besides it was said the people were poor, 
school-houses were destroyed during the war, and they would be 
unable in the Districts, to do what was required to put the law in 
operation. From other quarters there was expressed a bitter, de- 
termined opposition to the organization of schools, because the law
-P-A-G-E-8
8 
provided for the equal instruction of colored children, Some de- 
clared its passage only a political trick, and, that I was elected 
merely to be its Superintendent. The salary of $1200 for this 
office, without perquisites, gave too much color to this idea, The 
deep prejudices and strong passions causedby the war, had not en- 
tirely passed away. The system was to be launched like a ship up- 
on. a sea still swelling and surging under the influences of the over- 
past storm. : 
There was little to invite the efforts of a professional educator, 
save toil and’sacrifice, and hazard-of his professional skill. Other 
motives than self-seeking alone, could sustain’ one in the undertak- 
ing. Somewhat familiar with what the duties would be under fa~ 
vorable circumstances, a careful examination of the facts before 
me served only to increase the appreciation of the necessity and 
extent of the sacrifice required. But the work is of that nature, 
and in that direction, which, if without apparent, is not without in- 
visible Divine sources of direction, strength and triumph. 
FIRST EFFORTS. 
The law required of mea bond to the amount of one hundred 
thousand dollars, to be accepted by the Secretary of State, which 
was given, and I was informed nothing could be done till the State 
provided some way for money for schools., 
The law required an office to be provided and opened at the Capi- 
tol. There was no attention given this, save by the Governor, who 
kindly directed me to a room in the Capitol where I could work, 
and instructed the Superintendent of the building to give me chairs, 
a table, and to attend to my mail.. I applied to the Comptroller 
for the payment of the postage for the office, and was informed 
that he could not issue warrants for the purpose. 
Requirements of the Law tangled by delay.—Memphis and . Nashville had free schools, conducted under special Acts, but 
though ‘paying a large share of. the taxes of the State, had re- 
ceivéd nothing in return from the fund of the State for their schools, 
Beyond these, the State appeared without: free schools. Neither 
the Directors having been elected'at the dates required by law, 
nor the census taken, nor reports made, nor County Superinten- a
-P-A-G-E-9
9 
dents appointed, the law at first sight appeared tangled, and dif- 
ficult to get into operation. 
Solution of difficulties commenced by the appointment 
of County. Superintendents.—Sceeing that my efforts to accom-. 
plish anything, would be well nigh futile without the intermediate 
instrumentality of the County Superintendents to communicate with 
the people and see that whatever. method for the solution of the 
difficulties, I could find provided in the law, was carried out, I 
turned my attention first to their selection and appointment. 
Tn addition to personal acquaintance in a large number of the 
counties, every means of information was used to secure the best 
men who would undertake the office. In some instances there was 
some competition among excellent men for appointment, but in 
other instances, the odium attached to it beforehand, was such as to 
make good men hesitate whether to make the sacrifice. 
The first essential step before us was the organization required 
by the law, and the opening of schools throughout the State. ’ 
The quality of the work must improve as we progress. Conse- 
quently skill in teaching, and acquirement in. science, had to be 
temporarily subordinate to the skill and energy, self-sacrifice and 
devotion to the State, which would stand the odium of the work, 
take its first steps, secure the election of Directors, then get them 
to provide houses and teachers. 
As indicating the object of the appointment, a formal notice was 
sent to each man selected. [See Appendix B.] The entire eighty- 
four counties were early supplied, but [have made as high as seven ~ 
appointments in a county before getting one to serve. 
Although the law did not specifically require this office to be no- 
tified of the’ filing of the County Superintendent’s bond, yet it was 
so plainly important to be known here, for the security of the sys- 
tem, and of the public, that I requested anotice sent. Rarely have 
a corps of men accepted so grave a responsibility, with so little man- 
ifiest assurance of reward. Indeed their compensation was not de- 
termined, and they had to undertake duties intimately affecting 
every person in their respective communities, without any assurance 
of their being continued in office after the following spring, when 
their appointments would expire by law, giving little expectation of 
furnishing a fair trial for their efforts, even if they had confidence 
in their final success. 
_ Instruction to County Superintendents,—After thorough
-P-A-G-E-10
10 
study of the law, and of the condition of the State, a “Detter of In- 
struction” was prepared and published. [See Appendix C.] Also 
a blank was prepared and issued, in which to return the scholastic 
population. 
Meeting of Superintendents.—In response to the invitation 
from this office, a large number of the County Superintendents 
met here in connection with the Teachers of the State, November 
18th and 14th, affording a rare opportunity of hastening an ac~- 
quaintance with the system about to be inaugurated, and for the 
. discussion of important questions, arising in regard to modifica- 
tions of the law, “arrangement of school districts,” “location of 
school houses,” “qualification of Teachers,” ‘method of exami- 
nation,” and “selection of Text-books.”’ 
Early Plans for Educational Visits and Addresses,—My 
plans were immediately formed for. visiting different quarters of 
the State, spending as much time as possible in delivering ad- 
dresses on the many subjects connected with education, conferring 
with the people in regard to their educational wants, and with the 
Teachers, Directors and Superintendents in reference to the most 
prompt and successful organization of the free Schools. It soon 
became apparent that, in the minds of the best men among all classes 
—and of diverse sentiments in respect of other matters—there 
was a profound and intense anxiety increased by all the trials of the 
years of the war. Personal interviews revealed it, as well as the 
immense correspondence that came from different parts of the 
State. 
Some opportunity for the improvement of the young was demand- 
ed, but the ideas expressed of the methods for their education and 
training, were exceedingly diverse and indefinite. 
The only aid furnished me in the office, according to the law, was 
the clerical assistance of the Librarian, who was also Register of 
the State, either of which positions furnished work enough for one 
man to do. Besides, he had to be constantly present in the Library, 
and of course could not at the same‘time be present in my office. 
Persons in my absence came from distant quarters of the State, and 
failed to get the information, or do the business for which they came. 
The correspondence itself was more than one man could handle 
satisfactorily. My plans for visitation had to be reduced. ‘The 
election of District Directors and the taking of the scholastic popu- 
lation made slow progress: some districts would not act. In others
-P-A-G-E-11
11 
the Directors elected would not serve. The Legislature provided 
for their appointment on the recommendation of the County 
Superintendent, and confirmation in this office. Blanks for this 
purpose were sent out. 
It was found that many of the most substantial men who would 
not submit their names to an election, who indeed refused generally 
to participate in public affairs, would, in spite of the odium, for the 
sake of the public good involved, accept an appointment as School 
Directors. The work of taking the census showed more signs of 
success. In some localities individuals strongly objected to count-. 
ing colored children as scholastic population. ‘To their “minds it 
seemed to carry too strongly the idea of the manhood of the colored 
race. : 
The Legislature adjourned, making other needed amendments to 
the law; and March 17th, 1868, I sent a letter of information to 
County Superintendents, also calling for answers to certain ques- 
tions. [See Appendix, D.] 
The scholastic population came slowly, evidently imperfectly 
taken. Yet, in some communities, the education sentiment was so 
strong that their compliance with the law was prompt. . Directors 
were elected, enumerations taken, houses and teachers provided, and 
in the belief that the State would be faithful to its obligations, 
schools opened. 
March 24th, 1868, the Board of Commissioners of the School 
Fund, met upon the call of the President, Governor Brownlow, at 
his private residence in Knoxville, and by resolution called upon 
the Finance Board to provide, without delay, two hundred thousand 
($200,000,) for immediate expenditure, in payment of services of 
teachers and Superintendents, rendered and to be rendered. [See 
Appendix, P.] 
Some of the teachers had closed their schools, and could not wait 
for their pay without distress. April 2d, 1868, the amendment to 
the school law was through the press,.and I ventured to attach a 
notice to County Superintendents. [See Appendiz, B.] After the 
passage of this law the postage of the office and other bills were 
promptly paid. Here I may quote from my report to the Joint 
Committee of the Legislature, January 26th, 1869: 
“Endeavoring to be considerate of all reasons for delay, as well as of those for 
action, after waiting still further, I closed the enumeration May 30th, 1868, and an- 
nounced it to the Comptroller. 
“Beginning with the collections of 1866, he informed me that twenty out of
-P-A-G-E-12
-12 
eighty-five counties had not settled their accounts for that year, in his office. He, 
however, made an approximate settlement. of all the collections for school purposes » 
and reported to me August 3d, the amount: of $173,075.34, as collected from all 
sources by the State, for school purposes, for the fiscal year ending September 30th, 
1866. On account of the unsettled condition of the old school fund, it was found 
impossible, then, to include the atcrued interest. + The collection for 1867 was’ 
also due, but still further delay would-be necessary; and as the necessity for im- 
mediate payment.in some quarters waa. so great, it was decided to announce this 
amount and let the amounts accruing from collections and interest for Jan., 1867 
and 1868, come together. Before the 3d of August, additional counties and dis- 
tricts, struggling to get their enumeration, had succeeded ; and I therefore include 
them, giving a total scholastic population for the State, of 360,038. The amount, 
therefore, to.each individual, was $0. 487-100 ets. + [See Appendix, 0—Census of 
1867.] 
“This was immediately announced, and blanks for drawingit furnished to County 
Superintendents.” 
Compliance with the law was. s made the condition of receiving 
its benefits. [See Appendix, Lj 
Nearly a year’s-service had been rendered by. the County Super- 
intendents without any payment for their labors; some had expen~ 
ded considerable sums from their own.private means. ‘Teachers, too, 
had been months without pay for schools taught. The sentiment 
here and there prevalent that the State would not keep its faith 
with the schools, which the system has constantly encountered, found 
food for its support in these delayed payments. The issue of the 
smal] amount accruing from the taxes of 1866, though it was only 
a part of what should have been, was ready to pay over at that time, 
as the school taxes of 1867 had already been principally paid into 
the State Treasury since the previous December, proved most salu- 
tary. Parents, pupils, teachers, directors and Superintendents, be- 
gan to try again. The census was more fully and promptly reported.. 
[See Appendiz, O—Census of 1868.] Blank forms as required by 
law, were fully prepared ‘hy me, and published in connection with 
the school law and its’ amendments, making a pamphlet of forty- 
eight pages. In preparing these forms, the simplest possible were 
devised, consistent with a clear presentation and report of the man- 
ner in which each teacher and officer met the responsibilities im- 
posed upon him by law. . They proposed to make-the system in all 
its operations, transparent to the eye of any citizen, parent, teacher, 
or officer, who desired to look at them. 
- Immediately, there was a manifest decrease of letters, inquiring 
how to do this and the other duty required. A portion of the 
blanks were sent out by this office, others were, as provided by law,
-P-A-G-E-13
13 
to be furnished by the respective counties as a part of the records 
of the County Superintendent’s office. 
Preparatory to making a report from this office in November, 
1868, I published a set of blanks agreeing with the forms for 
doing business under the school law. The first. to be‘filled by the 
teacher, from the Register ; the second to be filled by the Clerk, of 
the District School Directors, from his own books and the report of 
the teacher, and the third to be filled by the County Superintendent 
from the reports made to him by the Olerks.of Districts, and from 
the records of his own office. Nothing that any friend or foe of 
the system could wish to “know about its workings, was omitted. 
Their simplicity and plainness left little room for misunderstanding ; 
yet, not a few officers have undertaken their work with so little 
knowledge of what.a good and efficient system required, and the 
‘whole field was so new to them, that they did not clearly see the object 
or importance of reporting the work they were doing, or exactly how 
to put the facts in the shape so plainly presented in the blanks.. A 
reference to Appendix will give some idea of the efforts made 
to secure these preliminary reports. Some County Superintendents 
took the work courageously in hand, and went from school to school; 
and district to district, and filled the reports. Many Directors re- 
sponded fully and promptly, many did not. 
The reports came in slowly ; indeed so few reached me before the 
* adjournment of the Legislature, that it seemed entirely inexpedient 
to publish them, The facts contained, however, in those furnished 
the office, were full of instructin in reference: st, to the educa- 
tional wants of the State; 2nd, the modification required for the 
more successful execution of the law; 3d, the favorable character 
of the results already secured. A sample of these preliminary re- 
ports in Appendix, gives a view of what they would have shown 
for the entire State. -As a sample of the remarks accompanying 
_ them, I make the following extract from one of these preliminary 
reports, dated January 8th, 1868: - 
«It was with great difficulty that I was able to organize districts for schools in 
the county. I had to write every advertisement, and -carry it to be posted, and to 
attend almost every election. In one district, I made four unsuccessful attempts 
to have an election for the purpose of electing district Directors. I was present 
at the fifth attempt, and by carrying the voters to the polls, succeeded. 
“The most popular preacher of the county has done his utmost against the sys- 
tem, and even went so far as to say, that the teachers would never draw any of 
the State appropriation; and this he did after I had brought the apportionment in- 
to the county. I was obliged to go into every district two or three times to get
-P-A-G-E-14
aa 14 
the scholastic population for the year 1867, which required some 300 miles 
of riding, In 1868,I had to go into every district on the same business. To get 
teachers qualified for their duty has been a Jaborious task; and had it not been for 
some persevering characters, it would have been impossible to start schools. 
“Visiting schools has been a source of pleasure, and the children generally seem 
to appreciate the visits, Only about one half of the Directors have refurned their 
reports to me, and their reports are so defective as to be of little importance. Ow- 
ing to bad weather, and my imperfect health, I have been unable to ride over the 
county, to get these Civil District Directors’ reports. Owing to the report circulated 
through the country, that the schcol law is to be repealed, the same Directors refuse 
to do any thing, until they.can be assured that there will bea handsome State Fund, 
and that the present school system shall remain unchanged, except for the better. 
T have five new houses under contract, which will be completed in time for summer 
schools. I still have faith in the State government. There shall be no failure on 
my part to do my duty as wellasI can. I am anxious to hear from Nashville- 
How long do you suppose it will be before I can draw the money from the taxes of 
1867 for this county ?” 
Many districts and some entire counties, failed to comply with the 
law, in season to draw the forty-eight cents and a fraction. Super- 
intendents, directors and teachers, resigned their position on ac- 
count of threats of personal violence. In July, 1869, sixty-three 
counties reported thirty-seven school-houses had been burned, 
teachers were mobbed, whipped; ropes were put around their necks 
accompanied with threats of hanging; ladies were insulted. Not a 
few teachers were dissuaded from teaching out their schools after 
they had commenced them, by the reports widely circulated and em- 
phatically repeated, that the State would not disburse any money for 
schools. In addition to these difficulties, Superintendents and Di- 
rectors, often had to employ those not so well qualified as they de- 
sired; instead of comfortable school-houses, teachers often taught 
in a mere shell of a building, indeed schools in the summer were re- 
ported to be taught under the shade of trees. Colored schools, 
+ found most pupils compelled to begin with the alphabet. White 
schools sometimes exhibited a hardly less deplorable lack of know- 
ledge of letters. One school reported out of seventy-five enrolled, 
sixty-eight beginning the alphabet. This was, perhaps, an extreme 
case, but the proportion of pupils prepared to go beyond the rudi- 
ments of reading, reckoning and writing, was alarming to any friend 
of the intelligence of the people. It pointed to the almost entire 
absence of education for the young in the State during the war, 
and to the additional fact, that since the cessation of hostilities 
there had been no adequate turning the attention of the young to 
schools of intelligence and virtue. 
Constant source of Embarrassment.,—A constant source of
-P-A-G-E-15
15 
' embarrassment has arisen from efforts on the part of some to cre- 
ate the belief that the system of schools provided for in the Code, 
was far superior to the. present, and indeed that the expense of the 
present system was too complicated, had too much machinery, that it 
used up the fund of the State, and left nothing for the schools. 
Attention is called to a brief comparison of the machinery of the 
old law, and of the new.

or else those pupils who could 
not pay tuition, were shut out. 
Such schools were, therefore, oft- 
en called pauper schools. 
  Under the New Law, 
Must be as free as air to all 
of the legal age; otherwise can 
not receive the State apportion- 
ment of moneys. But at the 
same time, any additional mon- 
eys for pay of Teachers or 
other objects, may be raised by 
tax on the District, or by any 
other method that does not in- 
terfere with the freeness of tui- 
tion.

Summary. —Looking through the oegoing parallel columns of 
comparison we find : 
dst. The old law and the new are identical i in tho, number and 
kind of territorial divisions they make. 
2d. Under the old law, it took ten: ‘different kinds of officers to . 
do the business, and these officers must be-different persons: whereas, . 
under the new law the number of different, kinds of officers required. 
is only four, Furthermore, the numerous officers under the old _ 
law were so independent of each other, that scarcely any. account ** 
ing. to one another took place; although no one of them all could, 
do his own special duty without having had accounts from one’ or 
more of the others. Of course, under such a state of things, the 
school business must and did go on in a totally unsystematic, dis. 
jointed, slipshod way. But under the new law, not ‘only are there 
less than half as many officers, but every one of them all is directly 
and distinctly accountable and responsible for and in regard to every 
item pertaining to school duty and to the condition of the schools,: 
and for every dollar of school. moneys coming into his hands. As 
a necessary result of this, under the old law there was no life, no 
activity, no efficiency; whilst. the new has in less than two years, 
produced an amount and an intensity of life, activity and efficiency, 
never heretofore equalled in any State of the Union in the same 
time and under like circumstances. : : 
3d. In employing, examining, and paying teachers, the machine- 
ry of the new law is decidedly simpler and more direct than the 
machinery of the old. 
4th. ‘The old law allowed none: but whites to be educated. The . 
new law educates all of them; and in addition, the blacks are lifted 
out of ignorance and saved from being a dangerous class. 
5th. The ownership and control of school houses and. sites re- 
mains under the new law just-where it was under the old. . 
6th. ‘The school moneys, under ‘the new law, pass through the 
hands of one officer less than under the old; and the one who dis- 
burses it'in each county is precisely the one who’-knows most about 
the schools and the teachers of the county.. And. more than that, 
whereas under the old law, the County Trustee was not required to 
make any report to any one concerning. the number and efficiency 
of the schools, or concerning the number of pupils taught in the 
schools, the County Superintendent must frequently make full re- 
ports to the State Superintendent upon all points relating to the in.

   terests of popular education, and can receive no moneys for. dis 
bursement till such reports are made. 
7th. Under the old law the common schools were very few i 
number and very poor in quality. Under the new law, the com 
mon schools have been organized and taught in every county, bu 
one, in the State. The entire number of them has been far greater 
than ever existed in Tennessee heretofore; the number of pupils 
taught is probably twice as great as ever were at any previous time 
collected in schools; and the quality of the teaching has been much 
in advance of any we have ever had in our State. And whilst all 
these things are true, something more and better is true :—this 
namely: Under the old law all those who attended without payinge 
tuition, were the subjects of the mockery, the jibes, the taunts, and. 
the insults of the thoughtless and the mean-spirited, under the con— 
temptuous name of pauper scholars. Now all alike attend without 
payment. Tuition is free to all, like air and sunlight. 
’ THE PEABODY FUND AND ITS AGENT. 
The aid of this remarkable charity I endeavored to secure for 
the State at once, on entering upon my duties. Indeed, Hon. J. 
W. North, and Hon. Samuel Watson, now a member of the Board 
of Trustees of the Peabody Fund, sought to put me in communi- 
cation with the agent, Dr. B. Sears, before I entered the office. 
Dr. Sears, rarely furnished for his labors by a lifetime of profess- 
ional services and observation. as an educator in America and 
Europe, saw our necessities and came at once to our relief. He 
attended the meeting of State Teachers and County Superintendents 
in the Capitol, in November, when’ the system was being inaug - 
urated; delivered an address [See Appendix, S.] replete with 
principles, considerations and suggestions that could hardly have 
been improved had he been charged with the duties of this office, 
and been able to see the field as it: could only be seen here. He 
has since addressed an East Tennessee meeting of Teachers at 
Memphis, [See Appendix, R,] besides speaking on other occa- 
_ sions in the State, and conferring with school officers of education 
by letter and personal intercourse, greatly to the benefit of the 
free school system. Indeed, the manner in which the fund 
is bestowed is quite as productive of good as the direct education of
-P-A-G-E-19
19 
individuals, by the money donated. [See Appendix, F., Letter 
to Coionel Bosson.| The appropriate recognition of the merits of 
Mr. Peabody, the wisdom in the manner of bestowing his charity, 
the excellent character of his agent, the fit confidence each reposes 
in the other, I have found so well set forth in a publication which, 
though bearing no name, yet is evidently so authoritative, that I 
present it in Appendix, [T.,] and need not repeat here. 
The bestowal of the Fund in this State, I learn, amounts to $17,000. 
Other amounts are already promised. ‘The aid bestowed to the 
- non-sectarian institutions—Lookout Mountain and Fisk Univer. 
sity—in aid of the preparation of young men and women as teach- 
ers in the free schools, is already sensibly felt in the system of 
State education. 
The former reports a class of 32 in training in the theory and 
practice of teaching, and now has a teacher with that work specially 
in charge, while the latter has had some 50 of its Normal pupils 
actually successfully engaged as teachers in the free schools of the 
State. 
The aid bestowed already upon free schools, where the population 
is concentrated, has secured graded schools in such places.as Knox- 
ville, Cleveland, Chattanooga, Clarksville, and other localities, 
where schools of that quality would otherwise have been impossible. 
Not only more direct educational aid to individuals has been con- 
ferred without waste upon separate instrumentalities, than was pos- 
sible in any other way, but model systems of schools, so greatly 
needed, have, by the aid of the fund, been maintained, thus exerting 
their indirect influence in shaping the notions and sentimenis.of 
these communities, and of those under their influence, towards the 
adoption of classified and graded free schools, which are undoubtedly 
the best form of schools for public education in towns and concen- 
trated populations. 
NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL AID. 
The National Government, by the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen 
and Abandoned Lands, under the direction of its Commissioner, 
General O. O. Howard, an earnest, philanthropical and Christian 
officer, established with special reference to the relief of the unhappy 
circumstances in which so many were placed at the close of the war, 
<
-P-A-G-E-20
20 
was operating widely in the State when this office was opened. In 
addition to its Assistant Commissioner, it had a Superintendent of 
Education, furnished with a Clerk. This Superintendent of Edu- 
cation collected facts in reference to schools, where to bestow this 
charity of the nation, and aroused the sentiment of Education by 
addresses, and reported results. Indeed, during a period under 
Col. Thompson, there were three assistants who spent their time in 
efficient efforts to organize schools in different quarters of the State. 
This office, at a time when greatly overworked, has been placed 
under obligations by the clerical aid furnished by the Bureau. 
The moneys have been chiefly bestowed in favor of colored schools; 
indeed a large share of the colored school. houses in the State would 
not have been built without its timely disbursements. Its entire 
disbursements in the State are reported as amounting to $145,656. 
72, to June 30th, 1869, and $25,000 per month since then is esti- 
mated as the expenditures, making a total of $152,166.72. 
In connection with this Bureau various National organizations 
have operated efficiently, sometimes sustaining schools, but especially 
in bringing into the field well qualified and competent teachers, 
willing to bear the odium, so rapidly passing away, of giving the 
first instruction to the colored children. Several of these organi- 
zations have expended large amounts of money. Their total ex- 
penditures since the commencement of their efforts for education 
in the State, are estimated at $300,000. 
These substantial National aids have also a special effect as an 
encouragement, assuring all that whatever may be the local oppo- 
sition to universal education, in any quarter, the work has thus 
guarantees that the spirit of the nation will see that it is finally 
triumphant. But it is especially gratifying that our own State has 
come forward and so far relieved other educational agencies of 
burthens in the State. 
The institutions with scholarships and other aids for students, are 
on the increase. Cumberland University, Maryville College, Mont- 
gomery Bell Academy, under the direction of the Trustees of the 
University of Nashville, among the older institutions of learning 
have special aid, I learn, for deserving students dependent upon 
their efforts; though to what extent they have the means of bestow- 
ing it, 1 am unable to state. Several Orphan Asylums in the State 
have also schools sustained in connection with them.

CHRISTOPHER R. ROBERT'S GIFTS. 
This philanthropic Christian merchant, of New York City, the 
founder and supporter of Robert College, Constantinople, moved 
by the lack of opportunitie which he saw for thorough Christian train- 
ing among the young, has established on Lookout Mountain, in this 
State, institutions of learning, where he has expended some fifty 
thousand dollars. Although students attend from a number of States 
the benefit. has been largely received by children of Tennessee, and is 
deserving of proper recognition. I hear only a favorable opinion of 
the educational work done by this noble charity. Still further facts 
will appear in regard to these and other institutions in connection 
with the reports from colleges and universities. The total amount 
of aid expended in the State by them, Messrs. Robert and Peabody, 
and by the Freedmen’s Bureau, and other organizations to which 
reference is‘made above, for educational purposes, a large share of 
which is definitely reported to me, and the balance estimated, reaches 
I believe, four hundred and fifty thousand dollars. 
SCHOOL DISTRICTS. 
The Code made the ‘Justices’ or Civil Districts, School Districts,’? 
and provided for the appointment of Commissioners to lay off the 
county into School Districts, and make a plan of them showing their _ 
“boundaries for record. The Revised Law recognizes these Civil 
Districts as the corporate unit, and these sub-divisions as its sub- 
districts. This question of smallest territorial unit presented at the 
outset some .of the most embarrassing difficulties. Our Civil Dis- 
trict corresponds most nearly to the township, town, or parish in 
other States, The town or township, however, is laid out on geo- 
metrical principles in the original surveys, and is generally six miles 
square, and susceptible of a regular sub-division. But the Civil 
District is laid out on the basis of political considerations, and takes 
almost any form in the range of geometrical figures, and is said 
sometimes to be six miles wide and forty miles long, and is suscep- 
tible of no regular sub-division in reference to school attendance. 
The population in many localities is scattered at wide distances 
apart, few families living near each other. Great relief has been 
experienced by the power of Directors to arrange for the sending of
-P-A-G-E-22
22 
children from one district to another, when distances would better 
accommodate them. In certain mountain localities children have 
been reported to me walking six miles to school; in others as en- 
tirely too widely scattered to furnish at any one point enough 
for a school. When in portions of the State where I have found 
a knowledge of the original townships still remaining, I could but 
regret that any wisdom had ever found it necessary to adopt the 
civil district in its stead, and more especially when I contemplated 
the power of those original towns in educating the entire people 
in the science and art of self-government, bringing as they do every 
question of public policy before them in open meeting, where it re- 
ceives consideration and action. The participation in the manage- 
ment of schools originally provided for in the Code, and now in the 
Revised Law, carries with it this benefit so far as it goes. 
Bui the introduction of sub-districts, though corresponding to 
school districts in certain other States, gives a chance of confusion 
and a shift of responsibility which may prove fatal. Sensible of 
this fact, and finding in the law that the sub-district was not re- 
quired unless there was some legal evidence of its pre existence, as 
provided for in the Code, I instructed County Superintendents at 
the outset that it was undesirable to sub-divide Civil Districts. All 
counties where these instructions could be observed, and there had 
been no sub-divisions, I believe the Civil District School Boards 
have found to work satisfactorily. But in many counties 
_ where the Civil Districts had been sub-divided, almost every incon- 
venience possible has arisen. . 
The sub-divisions have been found not arranged so that pupils 
were accommodated. Sometimes they reduced the possible atten- 
dance below a proper limit at which to sustain a school. ‘The sub- 
division and possible shifting of responsibility between the sub-district 
Board and Civil District has been prolific of its usual evils. The 
Civil District Directors are empowered to fix the boundaries of the 
sub-division of any district, and have very advantageously voted to 
reduce them all to the boundaries of the Civil Districts, and proceed 
with the school affairs under the exclusive direction of the Civil Dis- 
trict School Board. The sub-districts in Ohio, to which ours cor- 
respond, have been found a serious impediment. Great effort is 
now made to remove them. Pennsylvania now has each towhship 
in one School Corporation instead of the former system of School 
Districts under separate Boards. So great has been the inconve-
-P-A-G-E-23
23 
nience of the district system in Connecticut, which corresponds to 
our sub-districts, that the General Assembly has given power to 
towns to abolish it, and to form themselves into Union School Dis- 
triets. Says Mr. Northrop, the noble Secretary of the State Board: 
“We have 146 schools, with an average attendance-varying from 
two to six pupils, and 145 with such attendance ranging from two to 
ten.” After stating that the union of districts is slowly progress. 
ing, he enumerates the following advantages: ‘It favors the graded 
system, and this is the most important point of improvement in pub- 
lic instruction within the last twenty-five years. 
“2nd. It promotes unity, harmony and public spirit in the manage- 
ment of schools, and lessens the occasion of litigation and trouble. 
“8d. It prevents the one-man-power system. 
“4th. It equalizes the advantages of education. 
“Sth. It equalizes the expenses of the schools. 
“6th. It economises our educational expenses. 
“7th. It would secure better teachers, and a better adaptation 
of each to his special field. 
“8th. It will increase the permanency of teachers.” 
Hon. A. J. Craig, Superintendent of Public Instruction for Wis- 
consin, in his report for 1868, specifles seven reasons for the town- 
ship, or what is nearest our Civil District, and against the District 
system, which would correspond with our sub-district divisions: 
“Ist. Each parent would be able to send his children to the school 
which best accommodated them. 
«2d. School-houses would be built when and where they are 
needed. 
“3d. Schools can be graded more easily. 
“4th. Better supervision of the schools can be secured. 
“Sth, Greater economy. 
“6th. Equality of school privileges. 
“Ith. Better and more permanent teachers.” 
Massachusetts has had instructive experience. ‘The first Secre- 
tary of the Board of Education, Horace Mann, said: “I consider 
the law authorizing towns to divide themselves into districts, the 
most unfortunate law on the subject of education ever enacted in 
the State.” 
Dr. Sears, his successor, the present able agent of the Peabody 
Fund, devotes the most of a report to the subject, and says: “The
-P-A-G-E-24
24 
division of towns into independent districts is a great sacrifice of 
economy, for which no equivalent is received.” 
Gov. Boutwell, his successor, and the present distinguished Sec - 
retary of the Treasury of the United States, says: “I trust the day 
will again and speedily be seen, when every town will, in its munici- 
pal capacity, manage its own schools, and equalize the expenses of 
education.” 
The present Secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education 
says, after fifty years of experience and observation as a pupil, 
teacher, or member of the school committee in city and country, 
and as Secretary of the Board: “I honestly and most firmly believe 
that the sub-division of towns into numerous, and in the majority of 
cases, small districts, presents the most formidable obstacle to any 
considerable improvement in their schools.” 
The public sentiment finally has effected what these wise educa- 
cators so long recommended. 
The town system of organization has been established by law. 
The enlightened educational sentiment of the country found ex- 
pression in the following resolution of the National Educators in 
convention assembled : 
Resolved, That the township or civil district, is the true unit of school organi- 
zation, and should constitute a single district, with a Board of School officers elect~ 
ed by the voters of the entiye district, and empowered to levy taxes for school 
purposes, erect school houses, employ teachers, and otherwise take the entire local 
control and management of the school. 
SCHOOL HOUSES. 
The Free Schools in Nashville and Memphis, conducted as such 
city schools usually are under special, charters, have some good 
school houses. In this respect Nashville has very much the 
advantage of Memphis. But outside of these cities, the free public 
school houses in the State, when this office was opened, were rarely 
reported as fit for use, either in comfort or taste. 
The war found few good free school houses, and all of any quality 
that it reached suffered injury or destruction in its sweep. The 
school, like the family, suffers without the certainty of a home. 
School houses, such as they. were, which had been built before the 
war, on inquiry were often found on lands held by private parties,
-P-A-G-E-25
25 
and the buildings erected at whatever public cost, were for the public 
use only so far as agreeable to the owner of the land. Some were 
violently forbidden to the new system. Superintendents and Direc- 
tors were therefore urged to give special attention to securing proper - 
titles to all sites in the name of Civil District Boards. Sixty-three 
counties, up to July 12th, 1869, reported the securing of 221 sites, and 
the erecting of 885school houses. Many of the houses used for schools 
are not worthy of the name. In a colder climate, schools in them 
would be impossible. The habit is very common of using the same 
house and the same room for both school and church purposes. This 
discommodes both church and school. Each should have its sepa- 
arateroom. But the inconvenience of both holding their exercises 
in the same room is far less than the evils to a community of going 
without either. Logs are more commonly the material than either 
boards, or brick, or stone. By far the largest share of houses used 
for school purposes, whether public or private, have some defect, 
some unfitness for such use. School houses are needlessly crowded 
into unfit localities, too near thoroughfares or in too close proxi- 
mity to the din of travel or business, where attention and comfort 
in study are next to impossible, or near saloons and scenes of vice, 
where virtue is corrupted, or in swamps where health is destroyed, 
or where the summer’s sun or winter’s blast have too ready an ap- 
proach, or are uncouth in shape, and rendered more disagreeable to 
the beholder by the absence of doors and windows, or their broken 
glass, while the roof and walls vie with them in capacity to admit 
light, air and rain. But, alas, the furniture! Desks rare; some- - 
times only the seat which the pupil who writes uses for a desk by 
seating himself on the floor; seats rude, without backs often; a 
slab turned flat side up, and supported by several pegs for legs— 
some one of them on a part of the slab gone. Floors too often were 
miry with dirt and tobacco, and walls and ceiling hardly less so, 
save that their share of the filth had dried, and taken at the hand of 
some vulgar boy, the image of his own obscene thoughts. Often 
there are no out-houses; but, if any, they are not unusually utterly 
unfit for children to visit. 
Far too often the school house, the moral lighthouse of the neigh- 
borhood, would pass for a low grade of negro huts. My attention 
was early turned to the necessity of disseminating some correct 
ideas throughout the State upon the subject of school architecture. 
I met with very few architects in the State whose attention had
-P-A-G-E-26
26 
been turned particularly to the subject. The ideas which I found 
upon the subject among them, there seemed to be no way of getting 
by engravings, &., among the people. The works on the subject 
with which I was familiar, were too exclusively adapted to colder 
climates, ‘and presented plans more expensive than is necessary 
here. 
Maryland, under the supervision of Dr. Vanbokklon, I knew had. 
recently revised the subject, and bad plans and illustrations. Isent 
for them. They were good, but we had no means of meeting the 
expense of the engravings. Incidentally a friend called wy atten- 
tion to a manual on school houses and cottages for the people of the 
South, covering some eighty-three pages, amply illustrated, which 
an examinatian proved to be the work we needed. It was written 
by Hon. A. Thurston Chase, now Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion for the State of Florida, and was printed at the Government 
printing office, and circulated by the Freedmen’s Bureau. [I at first 
applied for a supply of two to each county. 
Afterwards, learning from General Howard more could be ob- 
tained, I asked and obtained five hundred additional copies. These 
have been freely circulated among Directors. Some of the perti- 
nent suggestions I quote : 
Tue Sire—wuat IT sHoULD comBine.—The officers of a regularly organized 
school district will have the selecting of the location for the school building. It is 
their duty to provide for the largest convenience of the children who are to attend. 
The points to be regarded are that it shall be central, yet retired, healthful, plea 
sant, and spacious. A few reasons may be added. It should be— 
CenTRAL, so that the greatest number may be accommodated. This need not ne- 
cessarily be at the geographical centre, but at the point most accessible for all by 
the roads and paths leading to it. 
Retire from the stir of business, the dust and confusion of the thronged roads 
or streets, away from the screaming of engine whistles and the roaring of railway 
trains. This precaution is needfal for the quiet of study hours and the safety of 
the children out of school. 
HEALturuL, that personal vigor and beauty may be promoted, and the capacity 
for improvement quickened. The neighborhood of marshes and sluggish streams is 
to be avoided. Also, proximity to stables, slaughter houses, gas works, and all 
manufacturing establishments, from which offensive odors are emitted, 
Puzasant, embracing, if possible, the range of a fine landscape view, with farms 
and cottages near at hand; villages, rivers, lakes and mountains more remote. 
Spactovs, giving an abundance of room for a well, outbuildings, play-grounds, 
separate back-yards for the boys and girls; and in front, room for shade and orna- 
mental trees, shrubbery and flowers. 
These accommodations will require at least one acre of ground. In locating 
      
Sa aa 
EE ET rr RRR ARBRE en
-P-A-G-E-27
27 
the building it will be found advantageous to place it a little in front of the centre 
of the lot, yet not directly on the street, nor too near the highway. 
The selection of a good site is of such high import that several State laws have 
been enacted clothing proper civil officers with power to determine on the location 
and appraise its value after ordinary negotiations have failed. 
THE WANTS of THE ScHooL-HousE.—The building should be fitted for the school 
on the same principle that a dwelling is made for the family, a storehouse for its 
merchandise, or a church for devotional exercises, Buildings erected for other 
purposes are seldom the right size or form for schools. The health and comfort 
of the children while at school are not to be disregarded. All their future will 
be affected by the impressions they receive and the habits they contract at school. 
They will reach maturity with more or less vigor of physical constitution, and 
make better or worse citizens according to the influences there exerted upon 
them. 
Nor are the wants of the teachers to be overlooked. There is no position more 
arduous, none requiring greater tact and skill, and certainly none more honorable 
and useful. Every aid should be extended, and every appliance provided which 
will heighten the effect of judicious teaching and at the same time diminish as far 
as may be, the arduous labors and petty annoyances incident to the work. Not 
only is an airy and commodious room required, but one that shall be suited to the 
size of the school. A large open hall for a small school is cheerless as a barn; 
while a small one, overcrowded, is always uncomfortable, and becomes infectious 
of disease. Good school-houses attract good teachers; poor ones repel them and 
bring education into disrepute. 
The essential requisites of 2 school-house aro briefly these: 
- A desk and seat for each pupil. 
. Aisles. 
. A teacher’s platform. 
. A teacher’s room. 
. Separate ante-rooms for the boys and girls, 
. Arrangements for warming, ventilating and lighting. 
Extensive rows of backless benches have long since been discarded. As soon 
as a child begins to write on a slate he needs a desk to lay the slate upon. If 
allowed or required to rest the slate or book upon his knee a habit of stooping is 
acquired, which leads to bodily deformity and organic disease. There are two 
styles of desks in use—the single and the double. 
Axr.—The condition of the atmosphere we breathe has much greater influence 
upon the health of the body and the strength, vigor and activity of the brain 
than is commonly understood. The external air,* as it comes to us from the 
forests, the field, the mountains and the ocean, is, as a general rule, in the highest 
degree promotive of health. When noxious vapors are infused into it they are 
neutralized by frosts, or being borne on the winds are absorbed by large bodies 
of water, aud by the countless leaves of living plants. Animals, by breathing, 
consume the oxygen and exhale carbonic acid gas. Plants, in turn, absorb the 
earbonic acid and exhale oxygen. . ° 
Any material change in the component parts of the atmosphere produces very 
temarkable consequences, Thus, if its oxygen be increased, a flame burns more Oo oo pe we 
  
* The atmosphere, according to Brande, contains, by weight: nitrogen, 75.45 parts; oxygen 
23,42; aqueous vapors, 1.03; carbonic acid gas, 0.10.
-P-A-G-E-28
28 
intensely, animal life is stimulated and shortened by over-action. If diminished, 
a flame burns more dimly, and at length is extinguished; the individual breathing 
it experiences a sense of languor and weariness; a considerable reduction even- 
tuates in death. Let the trace of carbonic acid be increased to one per cent., in 
consequence the brilliancy of a flame is dimished; a stupor comes over the indi- 
vidual inhaling it and a sensation is felt in the brain as though a band was drawn 
tight around the head. At four per cent., it extinguishes combustion and en- 
dangers life. At ten or twelve per cent., it causes speedy death. 
It has been ascertained by experiment that six candles weighing a pound con- 
sume, in burning, all the oxygen from twenty cubic feet of air per hour. A large 
kerosene burner produces a like effect on twenty-five cubic feet of air in the same 
time A cubic foot of coal gas consumes, in burning, twice that amount of oxygen. 
A. fire for heating » room produces similar results, and on a larger scale in pro~ 
portion to the flame. 
A man of medium stature, the capacity of whose lungs is about two hundred. 
cubic inches, exhausts all the oxygen from twenty cubic inches of air at each 
respiration, and imparts four and a half per cent. of carbonic acid gas to the 
expired breath. The blood at once absorbs the oxygen and is vitalized by it, 
while it rejects the effete or used-up matter which it has gathered in its cireula- 
tion through the system, and returns again through the arteries to infuse new 
life to every part and to receive anew the waste material which is no longer 
needed, but which the system cannot retain without experiencing serious organic 
derangement. When no provision is made for the escape of the impure air from 
a room it is reabsorbed by the lungs of those in it, and contaminates the blood with 
which it comes in close contact. | 
The weight of the exhalations from the lungs and pores of the skin, by 2 school 
of forty-eight pupils, during the six school hours of a day is set down at two 
pounds, and that of the carbonic acid gas. brought into the air by the returned. 
breath amounts to sixteen pounds per hour. Filthy floors and untidy clothes 
greatly increase these evils. We now pass to consider briefly the effect of these 
changes upon the animal economy. 
It is well known that the activity of any particular member of the body de- 
pends upon the amount of oxygen which is communicated to it. The black- 
smith’s arm, by increased labor, claims and receives an increased supply of blood 
and of oxygen from it. But let the needed flow he diminished, the arm shrivels, 
its muscular power is lost. A total suppression paralyzes it altogether. The 
brain, weighing only one-sixteenth of the whole body, consumes, by its ceaseless 
activity, one-sixth of all the blood thrown out by the heart. A suppression of 
the arterial current to the brain causes stupor and dizziness, followed by fainting 
and finally death. 
A simple experiment will illustrate the fact. Place any small animal, as a 
mouse, under a glass jar from which the air is excluded. Soon the breathing 
becomes perceptibly labored, growing more and more difficult, until he drops 
down in a stupor, and presently dies. If a candle were inserted instead of the 
mouse, the flame would, in a short time, burn dim and continue diminishing in 
brilliancy until it is extinguished. The air in the jar is now in such condition as 
to produce death to animal life immediately or extinguish flame at once. But if, 
on the other hand, the jar had been filled with pure oxygen, the resuts in both 
cases would have been directly the reverse. 
The purity of the atmosphere breathed by persons engaged in outdoor employment is one

chief cause of their enjoying better health and greater cheerfulness of spirits than those con~ 
fined to sedentary employments. It is a common remark tha¢ puny clerks and delicate cratts- 
men become, as soldiers or engineers, robust, hardy men. 
When the atmosphere is highly charged with heat it is liable to be Jess vitalizing than before 
its tempevature was raised, and from two causes. First, on being heated it becomes rarer or 
thinner, the lungs by a given expansion inhale Jess oxygen than when the air was cooler and 
denser. Second, the healthfulness of the air is impaired by heat, unless at the same time, the 
watery vapor which it contains is increased. Air, saturated with moisture at a temperature of 
thirty-two degrees, becomes insufferably parching to the lungs and skin when heated to seventy- 
five degrees without an addition of moisture. About three hundred per cent. more is required 
at the latter than at the former temperature. 
The nature of the refuse matter thrown off by the lungs and pores of the skin demands fur- 
ther consideration, Chemical analysis has failed to define, satisfactorily, the character of these 
bodily exhalations. They contain properties, so subtle as to elude detection, which are fraught 
with the most painful consequences to those who are exposed to their contact. Some idea of 
their nature may be formed by placing a sponge, saturated with water, in the youtilator of a 
crowded hail to receive the escaping current. The fetid air of the room imparts an offensive 
odor to the sponge, and the water even becomes putrescent. It isa well established fact that 
a person afflicted with an infectious disease so charges the atmosphere of a large assembly hall 
with a subtile contagion that any person breathing the air may be contaminated. 
What parent, teacher, or school officers, who regard the well being of the youth committed 
to their charge, can longer remain indifferent, on a candid consideration of the facts adduced! 
The report of the committee appointed by the New York City Board of Education, in comment- 
ing on the dangers to the pupils breathing an atmosphore which has been thus corrupted, says: 
“The rottenness of the air is communicated to the lungs, and lung diseases are generated. 
The enormous mortality from lung diseases, averaging a hundred and ninety deaths per week, 
is in a great part attributable to the foul air breathed every day by the 60,0U0 chijJdren in the 
schools. The prevalency of scarlet fever, which forthe past few years has been remarkably 
great in the primary schools, may be attributed to the same cause in even a greater degree.” 
VENTILATION.—The remedies for these evils are simple. They lie wholly within the reach 
of those who have charge of theconstruction of the school buildings and the management of 
the schools. In the first place, the causes which render the air impure should be abated as far 
as possible. When the air becomes impure it should be driven out and pure air supplied in its 
place; or, more definitely— 
1, The floors, walls, and furniture should be kept perfectly clean. 
2. Pergonal cleanliness of the pupils should be enforced. 
8. In constracting the building provision should be made for expelling the vitiated atmos- 
phere as fast as it becomes impure. 
4. At the same time arrangements should be made for admitting pure, fresh air from 
without. 
This is simply driving out our enemies and entertaining our friends. 
A room to be healthful should contain not less than one hundred and eighty cubic feet of at- 
mosphere to each person in it. And this enéire volume should be changed every hour. 
This can‘easily be done by availing ourselves of the fact that, when the temperature of any 
portion of the atmosphere is raised three or four degrees higher than that with which it is in com- 
munication, it immediately ascends. The expelled breath, being warmer and lighter, rises to the 
upper regions of the room, carrying with it the waste material from the lungs. It needs no argu ment to show that if this can be allowed to pass off, the purity of the air will be maintained much 
longer than if confined. 
Care must always be taken that cold air, when admitted, docs not fall upon the heads or backs 
of the occupants. It should be diffused go evenly and gently as to produce no perceptible currents, 
A fine screen, judiciously placed, through which the air may pass, will effect this object. Its po- 
sition may be overhead, and the air permitted to “sift” into the roomin that manner. But in 
common practice the careful attention of a teacher wil regulate this matter. 
Wanninc.—An even temperature is promotive of the greatest comfort and health, In an over- heated room the system becomes excited; the children grow restless, peevish, and disorderly, the teacher nervous and irritable, Relaxation will follow, exposing the system to insidious attacks of fevers, lung diseases, scrofula, &. A cold room is scarcely less harmful, The modes of heating most commonly in vogue are the fireplace and the stove. 
Furnirure.—Furnish well. Let this be the motte whatever the character of tho building may
-P-A-G-E-30
30 
be. If costly, it will command good furniture. Ef plain, noarly all the advantages of an expen- 
sive house may be attained, for the time, by furnishing well. There is vastly more comfort and com- 
tent to teacher and pupils where tho wants of the school have been handsomely provided for. 
The result on tbe one hand is cheerfa'ness, love of school, and progress; on the other a distaste 
for study, truancy, aud dissatisfactiou. There is now and then a brilliant mind that is fired with 
a thirst for knowledge—such will learn under the most adverse circumstances ; but this is not 
commonly the case. We have to win youth by making the path to knowledge a pleasant and, if 
possible, a flowery one. Children cannot sit stilllong at home. They need not be expected to 
preserve order at school when tho arrangements are not such ag to meet the plainest demands of 
the place and pursuit. Let those who oppose a liberal supply of furniture for the school try being 
pupils for a few weeks. Would they not gonorally yield their objections? Children grow restless 
and troublesome from the very agony of sitting still, ‘The school ought not to be a rominder of 
the pillory or the whipping post. 
‘The desks and seats may be so fashioned as to relieve thie irksomeness. They will then add to 
the enjoyment of the children and the ease of the teacher's duties, and stimulate the pupil’s progress. 
The height of the soat should be such as to allow the foot of the child to rest naturally on the floor. 
The tront edge of the seat muy be half an inch higher than the back, to prevent the tendency to 
slip forward, The height of the desk corresponds to the height of the child’s body. This may be 
determined by raising the arm to an easy position for writing or using the slate pencil, The desk 
may slope toward the pupil about one inch and a half to a foot of the width of the desk. Aspace 
about three inches in width at the front edge ought to be level or sloping a little from the pupil to 
provent pens and pencils rolling o:f. Sometimes a groove is ploughed out in which to lay them, 
leaving three inches for ink well in front of it. The back of the desk ought to have about the 
samo inclination from a vertical line ay a chair back, say two inches toa foot, Where the furni- 
ture is to be made by a carpenter at home, it is often desirable to make all the joints square. In 
that case the desk, seat, and back may be set at right angles. To get the slope for the back, and 
the inclination for the desk, ent the foot of tho standard on a bevel of one inch anda half to the 
foot. 
Bracknoarns are indispensable. With them a qualified teacher can instruct a large class 
with the same facility as one pupil. The illustrations given on them arrest the attention of 
children and help to enforce a truth or an explanation. Pupils are fond of working at them in 
classes. Espevially are they important in the instruction of primary scholars. Fifty children 
may be taught the alphabet and easy reading, as well as the elements of writing, drawing and arithmetic, sooner and easier with blackboards than fifteen cay without them. 
Pauvixs.—It is said that the objection which many parents, and especially mothers, have to 
sending their daughters to the public school arises from the disgraceful condition of the back 
yards, und the utter neglect of enforeing the decencies of life. In the first place there should 
be two separate privies, not within a hundred feet of the well or the house, nor near each 
other, A tight, high board fence or evergreen hedge should divide the back yards. Lattice 
sereons, overgrown with vines or evergreen hedges should add to their retirement. They 
should be large and supplied with vaults not less than six feet deep, through which, if possi- 
ble, a stream of water should pass. In that for the boys there should be an arrangement to 
prevent their standing on the seats. Let urinals be provided on one side of a partition and 
seats on the other. Subdivide them by short partitions so as to allow about two feet to each 
division. The whole should be painted and heavily sanded to prevent marking. The doors 
should he kept locked and no one permitted to enter except during the hours when pupils are 
allowed in the yards, The teacher, out of respect te common decency, will sce that nothing 
in connection with the establishment becomes a disgrace to the school nor a nuisance to the 
neighborhood; but the school officers will not neglect their share of the duty, by having the 
vaults cleaned and supplied with lime, wood-ashes, and other strong disinfectants during the 
hot season. This must be rigidly attended to by the janitor, in large buildings. Wood may, 
of course, be substituted for the walls above ground in the place of brick. 
Improving THE GrouNps.—If there were any point at which a digression from the rigid line 
of practical thought were admissible, it is here. The school has a character to establish. It 
is to be honored and cherished, or neglected and despised. To be honored, it must be frurtful 
in good works, Yet of itself it can do nothing. It has neither personality nor power, except as its friends impart vitality to it. Itis to be the reflection of their wisdom and care, or the 
memorial of their ignorance and impotence. ‘The erection of a fino building is one good step ; 
furnishing it well another; employing a good teacher is not the least item. But beyond these 
the improvement of the yard and grounds is worthy of much attention. Children catch the
-P-A-G-E-31
81 
sentiment of aplace as by inspiration. The beantiful lawn, the shady grove, the inviting play- 
ground, have a charm forthem. Even the flower border impresses rough and reckless fellows 
with respect. It helps to refine their thoughts and purify their hearts. 
In many districts, houses are yet to be built. Defective ideas 
cannot be too speedily displaced by Mr. Chase’s suggestions. Be- 
gin right—correct ideas of school-house-building are cheap—but 
tell powerfully upon the community by affecting the health, shaping 
the tastes and habits of neatness and order of the young. They do 
much to determine the tone and character of feeling, and so of the 
training of the young. Health, good taste, comfort, cleanliness as 
a result of skill in building a school-house generally do not add to 
its cost. School officers are culpable who do not secure them in 
every house they erect, whatever its materials, whether sawn tim- 
ber, brick, stone, or logs, as most in some quarters of the State are 
likely to be for some time. It is one of the recommendations of 
the little Manual, that it gives the model for a house of logs. The 
educator in Tennessee should not do such violence to his opportuni- 
ties as indifferently to consent to carry on his work in a house un- 
fitted in comfort and taste. Nature, so ready to offer abundant 
sites, ample in size, healthful in location, beautiful in outline, and 
enriched with grass, and groves, and springs, should not be so 
thwarted in her kindly purposes towards the children of the State. 
All possible should be done to second her inspirations for good, 
What memories are to cluster around these scenes of early educa- 
tion! Who will care to take the responsibility of bringing upon 
his head the bitter curses of the men and women of the coming 
generation for neglect in these simple particulars? Rather, who 
will not prize the blessings of generations yet unborn, for sweet 
memories yielded to all of their future lives from the overflowing 
joy of the hours spent around and in the district school-house 
beautiful for situation and a gem of beauty and taste in itself ? 
- How accurately, too, does the observant traveler or the man who 
would find a home for his family, or profitable investment for his 
capital, judge of the intelligence and virtue in any community by 
the presence or absence or character of the house for the free 
school! 
I find words so fit by a New York educator upon the subject of 
the School-room, that I conclude this topic by their use. He ob 
serves: 
The influence of external surroundings and associations in moulding character 
isa subject of general observation, and certainly at no period in life do they exert
-P-A-G-E-32
82 
so powerful an nfluence in shaping the plastic mind as during childhood and 
youth, As the delicate wing of an insect resting on the newly moulded potter’s 
vessel may feave an imprint there which will far outlast its own fleeting life, so the 
impressions which the mind receives from external objects are ineffaceable, and re- 
main fresh and distinct long after the objects which produced them have perished. 
How well do we remember the school-house where we received our early educa- 
tion, the foundation upon which has been reared all our subsequent attainments ! 
What a prominent place does this picture occupy in memory’s galaxy! We view 
ali its surroundings; every tree, rock, and shady nook has its own little story of 
childish sports and youthful pleasures. There, too, we recall everything connected 
with the internal arrangement, the maps which relieved its dusky walls, the few 
inferior pictures which attracted our youthful fancy, the arrangement of the school 
furniture and its adaptation to the wants of the pupils; and all these impressions 
as certainly had their effect in moulding the character as the instruction which was 
imparted by the teacher. We may not have recognized it at the time, and may not 
now be conscious of it, yet we know, from general principles, that it must be the 
case. 
Take, forexample one of the shattered, broken down school-houses that we so 
frequently find scattered throughout the country. There is no play-ground at- 
tached; weeds grow rankand luxuriantly around it. Externally it looks like a 
relic of the former age. Enter: the door creaks complainingly on its hinges, and 
you find yourself in a smail, low, dark room, where ventilation is secured by 
openings beneath door and windows, through which the wind howls dismally; the 
walls are without maps or charts, and stare at you with such blank faces that it 
seems a, relief to see your shadow there. The room is cold and comfortless, the 
children are found huddling together as near the stove as possible to secure greater 
warmth. What must be the effect of such surroundings upon the youthful mind 
which here receives its first impulse in the path of knowledge? No wonder that 
the children look upon it asa place of torture, and that, in after years they recall 
their school days, not as the happiest seasons of their lives, but rather as a period 
of imprisonment from which they longed to escape. 
On the contrary, let us visit in imagination, 9 neat, substantial, tasteful school 
house, such as, we are happy to say, do dot the country here and there, and which 
should serve as models to be imitated or improved upon by all succeeding architects 
of school houses. The'site is beautiful; it is surrounded by ample grounds, taste- 
fully adorned ; the building itself presents an attractive appearance; and within 
are all the appliances necessary to the comfort of the pupils and their rapid ad- 
vancementin study. The furniture is appropriate, the walls ave clean and white, 
or neatly papered and furnished with blackboards, maps and charts, such as will 
best facilitate the acquisition of knowledge in all the branches pursued; and here 
and there, looking calmly down upon the proceedings of the school room, is a paint- 
ing or engraving of one of the world’s great men, to which the teacher can occa- 
sionally point asan example worthy of imitation by all the pupils. Pictures of 
such men will render the children familiar with their faces, character and history, 
and convey impressions to their minds which will never afterward be forgotten. 
Such things as these give an air of refinement to the school room that renders it 
attractive to all hearts; and in after years, hundreds who have bid farewell to its 
hallowed scenes, recall with delight, the associations of their school days. 
The school room gives us almost our first impressions of life, aside from home in- 
fluences; and how important that the associations should be pleasant and agreeable,
-P-A-G-E-33
33 
influences refining and elevating! For the ideas and impressions there received 
will be fresh and vivid long after the school house itself may have crumbled away. 
SCHOOL TEACHERS. 
The Teacher has his share in every thought of education; indeed, 
a French writer declares, “The teacher is the school, the teacher 
is the text-book.” Ancients and moderns put in his hands the 
secrets of the future of the young. He stands in the place of the 
parent. The orator, the poet, the artist, and the historian, cele- 
brate his influence alike upon their personal attainments and upon 
the destinies of their nations and epochs. The teacher is the indis- 
pensable actor, the necessary part of every system of culture. As 
our work began, every educator felt that the free schools of Ten- 
nessee were to be like their teachers, ‘his law of likeness is as 
unchangeable as the relation of cause and effect. Several hundred 
thousand children needed instruction. Where were the teachers to 
be found? What qualifications could they bring? . 
For four years the soldier had been abroad and the teacher no- 
where. The necessities of the children cried for the immediate 
opening of schools. No time could be allowed for preparing teach- 
ers. Many were engaged in the State as teachers of colored schools 
who had been trained where schools had not been interrupted; but 
these could not be turned aside, and if they left their places others 
must fill them. Fortunately the County Superintendency furnished 
each county with a man especially to look to this supply, its prompt- 
ness and character, while it afforded me a ready instrumentality for 
effecting results in the way of attainments and qualifications as re- 
quired in the law. Examinations were recommended to be held, 
with questions carefully selected, so as to represent fairly each sub- 
ject in which the candidate was examined, to which answers should,,- 
be given in writing. The advantages of written over oral exami- 
nations are so apparent that the County Superintendents found their 
efforts in that direction cordially sustained. The following form of 
certificate was furnished as the readiest way of communicating 
throughout the State, important ideas—hints at methods of testing 
the qualifications of teachers as the law requires :

Various objections, offered to the requirements of the certificate, 
although they have passed away, are sufficiently instructive to edu- 
cators to be worthy of mention. Some could not see why there 
should be any inquiry into the moral character of candidates. This 
they thought trenching on sectarian ground. Others objected that 
the theory and practice of teaching had never been taught in the 
State, and therefore candidates were not prepared to be questioned 
upon the subject. 
Still others objected that the question of devotion to the Govern- 
ment and topics in the Constitution of the United States and of the 
State of Tennessee, was an introduction of politics. But a little 
observation and experience under the system, and a little time suf- 
ficed, so far as I have heard, to answer these objections in all reflect- 
ing minds—at best there is too low a standard of qualifications of 
~ teachers—too few have had good training either in school discipline 
or instruction, too few have seen good schools. 
The idea, the theory, is not sufficiently in the minds of those pro- 
posing to teach, nor are the means of information sufficiently at 
hand. There had been no. Normal Schools for the training of 
teachers, no teachers’ libraries, no teachers’ institutes. The pro- 
fession was not gencrally organized for their own improvement. 
Teachers not sufficiently qualified had to be employed, not with the
-P-A-G-E-35
35 
expectation of no improvement, but with the distinct purpose of ad- 
vancing their ualifications both in the theory and practice of teach- 
ing. Many would take a school simply as a make-shift. There are 
those in the communities who entertain so incorrect notions upon 
the subject that they would encourage Superintendents to give certifi- 
cates without examination, or who think the school system should 
furnish an asylum for incompetents—a support for those who failed 
by every other means to support themselves. Indeed, I must not 
pause to enumerate the dangers and evils besetting the system at. 
this point. Allintelligent educators, parents and citizens feel them. 
What is the remedy ? 
PAYMENT OF TEACHERS, 
An important means of elevating any service is the .character of 
its rewards. The condition of the finances of the State at once 
came in as a special embarrassment. The school officers had no re- 
sponsibility more than other citizens for their embarrassments, and 
no more power to reach them. Their duty was to be done in organiz- 
ing schools, perfecting their work for the young, and faithfully dis- 
bursing the school funds when the State was ready to pay. But 
with the condition of facts as it was, they had to arouse the confi- 
dence to secure the first movement of the system, and at times. it 
seemed as if ninety-nine hundredths of the labor required was. per- 
formed in answering, in conversation or by letter, the thousand and 
more inquiries about payment. It is impossible fully to report these: 
labors and difficulties. The various circulars presented in:the Ap- 
pendix to this report, were too largely called out and shaped:by this 
class of obstacles. 
One among the numerous letters from the office must suffice. to. 
show how this shadow rested upon all the efforts of the school-men, 
whether individual or associated, and the manner in which this office 
sought to dispel it. [See Appendix, N.] 
The degree of confidence felt in the State’s paying out the moneys 
collected for school purposes entered at once into the employment 
and qualifications of teachers. The more easily a lady or gentleman 
could find lucrative employment in some other direction, the slower 
would either be to engage in the free schools, with all the delays 
and uncertainties known to exist, to say nothing of the declarations 
so furiously hurled about, that the State never would pay out school
-P-A-G-E-36
      
                                          
  36 
moneys. This addition to the task of the school officers was most 
unnecessary. The delays that actually came in the payment of 
teachers was sufficient. The letters of distress and tales of suffer- 
ing were not only most trying in themselves, but they added to every 
difficulty in the way of the success of the schools, especially in- 
creasing the objections to good and competent teachers taking em- 
ployment. Almost entire counties, after receiving warrants for their 
school money, were delayed months before they could be cashed, 
and the teachers generally declined to engage in the schools 
again. 
Even these obstacles, added to those natural and usual in the way 
of advancing the standard of qualifications among teachers, have not 
prevented a steady improvement in the profession. 
County Teachers’ Associations were recommended to all Superin- 
tendents. As a means of adding interest to these meetings and 
creating a spirit of emulation among the teachers, Superintendents 
were advised to call for a monthly report from each teacher. The 
presentation of these reports would show the excellencies or de- 
ficiencies of each school, and afford an opportunity to bring out by 
discussion among the teachers, or remarks by the Superintendent a 
clear view of the best method of discharging each of the difficult 
duties imposed upon the teacher. It is an easy method of communi- 
cating to all the teachers of the county the ideas and skill of the 
best. ‘They were advised also, to establish in each county, a teach- 
er’s library, which should contain works upon the subject of the 
theory and practice of teaching. 
A. 8. Barnes & Co., presented for their use a large number of 
volumes of their Teachers’ Library. Dr. Sears, Agent of the Pea- 
body Fund, also arranged to co-operate in furnishing this means of 
diffusing educational information and advancing the qualifications of 
teachers. 
The success of these county efforts has been various, In some 
counties, such as Davidson, Bedford, and Knox, the results have 
been conspicuous for their excellence. 
In Bedford I found an association already in existence. At the 
meeting which I attended the following was the arrangement of the 
order of exercises : 
Criticism on English Grammar, by C. L. Randolph. 
Phrenology a Science, by Rev. E. M. Anthony, 
Mind and Matter, by John Douglass,
-P-A-G-E-37
37 
Mathematics the only Perfect Science, and no perfection in any science can be 
had without its aid; by Milton Kimsey. 
Atmospheric Electricity, by J. W. Palmer. 
J. R. SHorrner, Chairman E. C 
The essays to which I had the pleasure of listening, were evi- 
dently prepared with great labor, and were full of valuable facts 
and thoughts. 
During the exercises a recess was taken, when Col. Shoffner, one 
of the excellent neighbors, and his daughter, came forward and 
offered those present a free and abundant lunch. This was espe- 
cially enjoyed by those who were fifteen or twenty miles from 
home. 
Aside from essays, discussions and addresses, the Association 
voted to secure, if possible, books on the theory and practice of 
teaching, and on the sciences taught; thus laying the foundation of 
a teachers’ library. They had already some volumes on the subject 
of teaching. 
A plan was also proposed to make the meetings of the Associa- 
tion serviceable—more after the manner of the Teachers’ Institute 
—presenting illustrations and discussions of the best methods of 
teaching. . 
The Association has an interesting and suggestive history. 
Formed in 1855, it was broken up by the war, but reorganized at 
its close. Composed now of persons who took opposite sides in the 
war, nothing could be more harmonious than their educational la- 
bors, so completely are the exercises of the Association and efforts 
of its members devoted to the advancement of education and the 
improvement of the young. All its members offer their co-opera- 
tion to the County Superintendent in his arduous work of organizing 
the free schools of the county. 
I extract the following published account of one of the mectings 
of the Davidson County Association: 
“Davidson County boasts of one of the most energetic County Teachers’ Associa- 
tions in the State. This Association holds its regular mouthly meetings at Nash- 
ville. But the regular meeting of March was held over the hills and far away at 
Goodlettsville. Three hack loads went from Nashville; and they who were noi 
from Nashville. were three all told. The weather was cold, but hearts were warm, 
and all who went enjoyed it. But we said— 
‘Pile on more wood, the wind is shrill, 
But let it whistle as it will.’ ” 
The following programme was carried out: 
Leciure on Schovl Government, Rev. J. Bradon,
-P-A-G-E-38
38 
Drill in Gymnastics, Rev. J. Bradon. 
Class in Reading, Miss Aggie Hammond. 
Drill in Elements of Music, G. L. White. 
Lecture on Primary Instruction, Prof. J. Ogden. 
What with remarks and general business, and good humored efforts to be 
witty, the day passed swiftly away, and three hack loads of teachers went back 
to Nashville, to rally fur a second attack on some more vulnerable point of the 
enemy's defenses: 
Be it said, that the people of Goodlettsville were stirred up by the Institute, 
and promise better things next time. Atany rate, we propose to pass on the 
light.” . 
In many of the counties, their meetings were attended by direct- 
ors and friends of education. All are susceptible of great improve- 
ment. Wisely directed, their time filled up with. timely and able 
essays, addresses and discussions, they are invaluable educational 
auxiliaries. 
Said Horace Mann: “The great agent for carrying the benign 
work of reform to our schools, must be the teacher himself.” 
Dr. J. C, Warren, a distinguished Boston surgeon, used to relate 
that, when in London, he witnessed a difficult operation upon the 
human eye by a celebrated English oculist, and was so struck with 
- the skill and science of the operator that he sought a private inter- 
view, and inquired by what means he had become such a master of 
his art. “Sir,” replied the oculist, “I spoiled a hatful of eyes to 
learn it.” There are far too many children spoiled in the school- 
room by those who take no other means to learn how to teach. 
It is due that this slaughter of children should cease, and a greater 
effort be made to qualify teachers. 
Training of Teachers is not limited to new systems of education. 
It is not enough to bring out one generation of good and compe- 
tent teachers, The effort must be renewed for each generation. 
But the start is the most difficult of the steps in this process. The 
imperative demand for trained teachers for our schools, all friends 
of the system felt at the outset. Numerous plans were suggested. 
*Normal Schools, designed especially for this work, was the first 
remedy to occur to all. The necessities of the free Christian state 
in this country have been a constant inspiration to efforts for educa- 
tion. “Massachusetts, the first colony to establish the free school 
  
*“The French adjective Normal is derived from the Latin noun Norma, which signifies, a 
carpenter's square, a rule, a pattern, a model; and the very general use of this term to designate 
institutions for the preparation of teachers, ‘leads us to the idea of a model school for practice, 
as an essential constituent part of a Teachers’ Seminary.”

for universal education, was the first also in the educational reforms 
which have characterized the last forty years. Her thoughtful men, 
studying the necessities of the young, saw that the only remedy 
the State could apply was that of free education, and sought to im- 
prove the free schools. They agreed that “as is the teacher so is 
the school,” and sought out the best means of improving their 
teachers. They were not the first who had done this; they only 
repeated the application of a principle employed at some time in 
the history of every nation that has reached any eminence. The 
Hebrews had their schools for the prophets who were to teach the 
people. Plutarch represents Plato as advising nurses “Not to tell 
all sorts of common tales to children in infancy, lest thereby their 
minds should be in danger to be filled with foolish and corrupt no- 
tions.” He also represents the poet as saying, 
“If we'll have virtuous children, we should choose, 
Their tenderest age good principles ¢’ infuse.” 
and quotes the Greek proverb, “He who lives with a lame man 
will learn of him to halt.” He is very severe on those parents 
who would commit the training of their children to the vicious or 
otherwise incompetent; and remarking that “a good schoolmaster 
ought to be such a one for his disposition as the tutor to Achilles,’”’ 
he says, “‘We are to look after such masters for our children as are 
blameless in their lives, not justly reprovable in their manners, and 
of the best experience in teaching.’ The followers of Confucius 
went forth as teachers among the young, with this charge: ‘‘ Wheth- 
er you wake or sleep, consider always what is a proper regard for 
yourself. Whatever you do or omit, never forget that you are set- 
ting an example.” The Prussians repeat, as a maxim, that “ What- 
ever you would have appear in the life of a nation, you must put 
into its schools.” The State must depend upon the teacher to do 
this. The character of education is always determined by those 
who impart it. Therefore it is that normal schools—schools in 
which teachers are taught—by the direct and powerful influence 
which they must inevitably exert upon the principal sources of 
public intelligence, virtue and happiness, will serve to invigorate 
and intensify the entire social organization. 
Tf conducted in accordance with the true intent and spirit; if 
conducted as they may and should be, they will do more in the 
course of years for primary education, for the education of the fire- 
side and the common school, and hence for the real welfare of so-
-P-A-G-E-40
                              
        40 
ciety, than all other agencies combined. For who does not know 
that the moral and intellectual renovation of entire neighborhoods 
is often effected by the almost silent yet potent influence of a good 
school, and a faithful, intelligent, skillful and conscientious teacher 
of youth. 
One of the first great struggles in the revival of education in 
Massachusetts, was for the establishment of Normal Schools. So 
great was the prejudice which they first encountered, that certain 
districts voted against the employment of teachers taught in those 
schools. All this opposition long since passed away, and teachers 
trained in these professional schools have been at a premium. Yet 
it cost the early friends of Normal Schools a long and grave strug- 
le. 
Mr. Chas. Brooks had caught the idea from the Prussian system, 
and began to lecture upon the importance of the establishment of 
Normal Schools by the State, and continued his labors, receiving 
co-operation from such leading minds as Hon. Horace Mann, Dr. 
Channing, Hon. John Q. Adams and Hon. Daniel Webster, [See 
Appendix, Y,] until Mr. Dwight came forward and offered the 
State $10,000 towards trying the experiment, and the Legislature 
accepted it April, 19th, 1838. The result is well stated by Gov- 
ernor Bullock. He says: 
“Tregard the Normal Schools now as much a certainty in the complicated yet 
unified organization of persons and things which we call THe Srars, as the leg- 
islative or executive or judicial departments of the government, To invest these 
schools with all the requisite intellectual machinery, the State now appropriates 
nearly thirty thousand dollars annually; and, I doubt not, will increase this 
amount to meet any reasonable demand. For one, I Jike this, and take it to 
heart. I do not believe we can expend too much in this way. I never did be- 
lieve, and I never shall believe, that, from the time of the apparently extravagant 
expenditure upon Solomon’s Temple until now, too much money has ever heen laid 
out on a church edifice, or that from now to the end of time, too much of the same 
article is likely to be expended upon school-houses or school teachers. 
I think that every observing person who has watched impartially the stages of 
our social progress for the last twenty-five years, must concede that in no calling 
or pursuit has there been greater advancement than in that of teaching; and that 
the Normal Schools have manifestly elevated the professional standard in this de- 
partment. The man who doubts this will doubt all progress,—will doubt the ben- 
efit of all education,—will be unhappy over a world now covered witha network 
of railroads and connected in all its parts by the daily communication of a weird 
tongue which speaks under the seas to all people,—and he ought henceforth to 
have another world and another civilization, all his own. We have nothing to do 
with any such. All men who are fit for our country and our time must agree that 
these institutions have added dignity and grace and power to the department of 
education.”
-P-A-G-E-41

The Massachusetts State Board of Education aemark in their 
last Annual Report: 
It costs the Commonwealth about two hundred dollars annually to support each 
person in her reformatory institutions. It costs less than fifty to prepare a well 
trained teacher for her Public Schosls,—the great antidote for crimes and pauper- 
ism. 
Other States did not long allow such benefits to be enjoyed ex- 
clusively by Massachusetts. Educators throughout the country 
saw that it was clearly demonstrated that teaching deserved and 
would be as much benefitted by special professional schools, as 
Medicine, Law or Theology. 
State and city systems established them on the grounds of ne- 
cessity and economy. 
Hon. B. G. Northrop, Secretary of the Board of Education for 
Connecticut, in a recent very able report, observes: 
There are now fifty-two Normal Schools in this country, forty in the Northern, 
and twelve already established in the Southern States. The number is rapidly 
increasing. 
In Wisconsin six have been established. New York has added eight to the 
very efficient school in Albany. Pennsylvania has six, Massachusetts five—four 
supported by the State and one by the city of Boston. All but two of the other 
States that have long maintained a public school system have one or more Normal 
Schools. 
Cincinnati, Chicago, and St. Louis have, each, a Normal School 
as a part of the city system. New York City has two—one for 
white and the other for colored teachers. 
Our State Efforts.—The importance of securing the benefit of 
this powerful agency for our teachers at the outset in opening schools 
after the war, was urged upon our Legislature in the session of 
1867-8. Rev. B. Sears, D.D., LL.D., Agent of the Peabody Fund 
offered aid. 
Hon. Wm. Bosson, Chairman of the House Committee on Com- 
mon Schools, prepared and presented a bill providing for the estab- 
lishment of the Normal Schools, free to all who were admitted, and 
to be located in each grand division of the State, to be associated 
with some organized university, college, or other school of learning, 
to be under the direction of a Normal School Board of Education, 
to consist of the School Fund Commissioners of the State, “and 
six persons, citizens of the State, to be nominated by the Governor, 
and confirmed by the Senate, two from each geographical district of 
the State, two to be nominated for two years, two for four years, and
-P-A-G-E-42
42 
two for six years;”’ and the State Board were to fix the number to 
be admitted from each county, and the Civil District Directors select 
suitable candidates for admission from each county. 
The endowments and admissions were to correspond with the 
scholastic population of the respective divisions. Each person ad~ 
mitted was to obligate himself or herself to teach two terms in a 
free Common School of the State. 
After instruction twenty-two weeks, the pupil, on passing examin- 
ation was to have a certificate good for ten years, from the Principal, 
indorsed by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction: 
Endowments by the State; also a system of inspection and re- 
ports were provided. 
On solicitation, I presented the outlines of a brief Bill intended 
to inaugurate the system of Normal instruction, to be modified as 
experience should dictate. It provided for a similar Normal School 
Board, similarily appointed, put upon them careful restrictions; 
‘but empowered and required them to establish, as they should 
deem best, one Normal School or two Normal Schools: “Said 
Board of Trustees of Normal instruction are hereby fully vested 
with all the rights of a corporate board, to receive bequests and 
endowments in land, moneys, books, or services; and to buy, hold, 
and sell lands and erect buildings, make improvements, procure ap- 
paratus and library, arrange a course of study, select text-books, 
determine the manner and times of admission of pupils, employ 
teachers, and perform all those acts necessary for the successful 
training of teachers in each grand division of the State, either in 
connection with institutions already established or by the establish- 
ment of separate institutions, or by the conduct of Teachers’ Insti- 
tutes, as they shall in their judgment, deem best.” 
But no Bill passed. This, however, did not change the opinion 
of educators, nor turn them from their purpose. Schools opened 
more widely than any anticipated. More money was paid. The 
great law of demand and supply began to operate. Teachers began 
to prepare themselves for teaching—to seek other and better attain- 
ments in their profession. The ordeal of examination when justly 
conducted, was an effective stimulus. 
They sought teachers to aid them. Schools, academies, colleges, 
and universities began to meet the demand, though the State did 
nothing. They established classes and departments in the theory 
and practice of teaching. A reference to the summary of statistics
-P-A-G-E-43
43 
from colleges, universities, and other institutions of learning, will 
show something of how they co-operated in this great work. Im- 
provement in teaching does not limit itself to free schools. It aids 
the teachers equally in all others. It is a benefit in which every 
member of the profession has an interest. It affects the welfare of 
every child to be instructed, whether in the public or private schools. 
Improve the instruction in one class of schools and that in the 
other must, before long, compete with it. Free schools will not be 
attended if pay schools are better taught; and pay schools cannot 
maintain themselves with poor instruction if it is excellent and 
progressive in other schools. 
But the free school system presents the great demand. It com- 
prehends especially the interest of all the people. A profession of 
three thousand. persons engaged in forming the minds of the young, 
comes quite as near as possible to the vital and essential interests of 
the State. In no way can it better protect itself or accomplish the 
objects of its existence. Their establishment in Tennessee should 
not be delayed. : 
Is there not some Dwight to come forward and make the State a 
donation to aid in their first establishment? Is there not some Brooks 
or Channing among our clergy, some Everett, or Adams, or Web- 
ster among our statesmen, of the foresight and disinterested devotion 
to the public welfare, to come forward and lead the enterprise of es- 
tablishing Normal Schools in the State to a successful issue? 
Female Teachers, as will be seen by reference to the statistics 
from the schools, have not been so generally employed as the interests 
of the State demands, or as is common elsewhere. A single extract 
from a report of the Boston city schools expresses the facts and ar- 
guments so well that I give it in place of an extended statement: 
By far the greater portion of the teaching of our schools is done by women—in 
all five hundred and fifty, to fifty-five males. By our system thus, the sensitive, 
susceptible, quick-responsive nature of woman is brought to the control and guid- 
ance of all the earlier stages of our school progress; the tender, timid spirit of the 
child meets, therefore, all the gentleness ef woman’s love, the fertility of woman’s 
invention, the patience of woman’s long suffering, the hope of womav’s faith, and 
the courage of woman’s confidence; and these gifts of Providence are, as far as 
possshle, transferred from the home to the school room, and the school in some rea, 
sonable degree, is made to reproduce the simple, natural culture of the family. Nor 
is this merely the theory of our system, but the living, effective test by which the ac- 
tual excellence of any school isto be measured—by whose application each teacher 
may discover in these regards the degree of her success or her failure. We have 
done weil in thus avoiding what Richter said he dreaded“ that grown-up, hairy
-P-A-G-E-44
44 
hand and fist, which knocks on the tender, fructifying dust of childhood’s blossoms, 
and shakes a color off, first here and then there, until the proper, many-marked 
carnation comes to be found.” 
The wages paid female teachers, it is gratifying to notice, is in 
some counties equal to that paid males. This promises well. Wo- 
man’s success in teaching will do the rest in winning among us her 
proper place as an educator of the young. 
Government in School.—It is an excellent rule affirming that 
“ All instructors shall exercise as much discipline in their schools 
as would be exercised by a kind and judicious parent in his family.”’ 
An able teacher well says: 
There should be on the part of the teacher a true love for his work, united with 
correct views of the nature of that relationship which ought to exist between the 
scholar and the instructor, leading to a real bond of sympathy. The prominent 
idea in my mind, on the subject of teaching, is the inner, private life of the school 
room; that which is not seen, except as manifested in the ease, happiness, confi- 
dence and enthusiasm of the children, The work of instruction should be ele— 
vated into a sacred profession, the teacher moulding his character by constant 
self-examination, striving to acquire the best qualities, both of mind and heart. 
Then will he find his reward, day by day, in his own progress, and in the improve- 
ment of his pupils. 
Says another: 
If a scholar realizes that the teacher is deeply interested in his welfare; that 
good order and the scrupulous observance of rules are essential to that welfare ; 
and is kept fully employed, he will rarely prove troublesome. Interest a scholar 
in what is useful, purifying, elevating,—and you acquire, almost necessarily, a 
sufficient control over him. 
The difficulties and importance of school government it is impos- 
sible to estimate at the period at which our schools have opened. 
State and national law itself has been so much in abeyance; paren- 
tal authority has had no control; the young have for a period, so 
widely followed their impulses as moved by the exciting and unto- 
ward events that have been passing. The position of teachers has 
been specially trying ; their success has been gratifying. 
The secrets of success are with’themselves. He who would most 
successfully govern others must control himself. Too many chil- 
dren catch the spirit of a word and a blow, or a word and a threat. 
The school should seek to put reason in the place of passion, and 
reduce all fictitious notions of honor to the principles of right, and 
teach the young to be more careful about giving insults than 
anxious to see them and resent them unto death. A sound and
-P-A-G-E-45
45 
healthful subjection of the will and impulses of the young to con- " 
science and right, by the teacher and parent, will put them more in 
their own control and less at the command of those who would play 
upon false notions of honor. 
A word is a breath, and cannot justify taking life. No laws ad- 
mit it. Besides, in truth, the bad word is more injurious to the 
speaker than those addressed. 
A man is responsible for what he does—not for what others say 
of him. A lie is the liar’s act—not of one falsely accused. 
First.—A most apparent result of government in school, is the 
order and quiet necessary for the successful work of teacher and 
pupils—the successful progress of the school exercises. 
Second.—A direct result is, the training of the pupil’s ideas and 
habits of method and order—a place for everything, and every- 
thing in its place. Each hour has its duty. 
Third.—It prepares the pupils to live in an orderly home, or to 
engage in methodical business, or to submit to the laws of the 
State. The school is a little society; nay, a little State. 
Fourth.—Its ultimate result should be the training of every 
child’s will to the habit of obeying conscience and the right. 
The will can not acquire knowledge; but it does acquire stub- 
borness, obduracy, or obedience. 
Whatever else the child has or acquires, his will must direct it, 
and determine his strength, or weakness. He may know by other 
powers, but he does by force of will, A wisely legislative govern- 
ment in school has, therefore, a most direct bearing upon the in- 
terests of the homes represented, as well as of the State. Each child 
that is a law unto himself is sure not to break the law of his par- 
ents, and bring down their gray hairs with sorrow to the grave, 
nor to break the laws of the State, and bring himself to an un- 
timely end upon the gallows. 
MORAL TRAINING. 
Something more than good government in school is needed for 
moral training. The judgment, affections, and conscience, as well 
as the will, bear a part in man’s moral acts. Good or bad com- 
pany, pure or impure imaginings, are powerful agencies of purity
-P-A-G-E-46
46 
or corruption. The school must guard them with sleepless vigilance 
We need good hearts, as well as good heads. Greatness of intel 
lectual parts is not all of this greatness. 
“Jf parts allure thee, think how Bacon strived, 
The wisest, brightest, meanest of mankind.” 
Dr. Loudon makes the following significant statement : 
“Of about thirty boys, educated in contempt of useful knowledge and oceu- 
pation, who spent their days in reading novels, the lives and confessions of pi- 
rates, murderers, etc., and their nights in the streets, dram-shops, gambling-sa—- 
loons, circus, and theatre; of these boys, at the age of forty-five, one had been 
hung for murder, one for robbing the mail, and three as pirates; five died in 
the penitentiary, and seven lived and died useless vagabonds about the streets ; 
three were useful mechanics; the fate of the remainder is unknown. Of about 
forty boys educated with me, by a really scientific teacher, under the old fogy 
system of restraint, at the age of fifty-five, one was a member of Congress; one 
judge of the supreme court; two judges of the circuit court; three physicians ; 
five lawyers; fourteen were dead; and the remainder were farmers and mechan- 
ies; and, so far as is known, not one of them was ever called before the bar of 
his country on a criminal charge. They all had comfortable homes, exeept two 
or three; and every one of them was passably respectable.” 
Our schools should promote the formation of that well-balanced 
character which comprehends in itself, “whatsoever things are true, 
whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatso- 
ever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever 
things are of good report.” The teachers should be an example 
of what the scholars should be. The time of the pupil should be 
occupied with labor or innocent amusement. We shall never be 
too old to remember with advantage those words of the child’s 
hymn: 
«Por Satan finds some mischief still 
For idle hands to do.” 
The incidents of school life, and anecdotes ilustrating moral 
conduct, should be used by teachers to convey moral lessons. The 
conscience should be kept acting. Cowley’s Moral Lessons, in-~ 
cluded in the list of Text-books for the State, is the most admired 
little Manual for this purpose yet proposed. 
The following are the well-chosen subjects of its lessons, all of 
which are illustrated by appropriate anecdotes : 
1. Do unto others as you would have others do to you. 
2. Repay all injuries with kindness. 
8. A little wrong done to another is great wrong done to ourselves. 
4, The noblest courage is the courage to do right.
-P-A-G-E-47

. Be slow to promise, but sure to perform. 
. Honor thy father and mother. 
. Think the truth; speak the truth; act the truth. 
. Do good to all as you have opportunity. 
. Speak evil of no one. 
10. Carefully listen to conscience, and always obey its commands. 
11. We must forgive all injuries, as we hope to be forgiven. 
12. Learn to help one another. 
18. The greatest conqueror is the self-conqueror. 
14. Swear not at-all. t 
15. Be faithful to every trust. 
16. Be neat. 
17. Right actions should spring from right motives. 
18. Labor conquers all things. 
19, Be honest in ‘little things,” upright in all things. 
20. A person is known by the company he keeps. 
21, Learn to deny yourself. 
22. Live usefully. 
23, Be kind to the unfortunate. 
24, Do right and fear not. 
25. Be patient and hopeful. 
26. Be merciful to animals, 
27, It is better to suffer wrong than do wrong. 
28, It is more blessed to give than to receive. 
29. Think no thoughts that you would blush to express in words. 
30. Live innocently if you would live happily. 
21. We must learn to love others as we love ourselves. 
82. The good alone are great. Oona 
The difficulty which the use of the Bible in schools of the State 
gives to some, it is very hard to explain on patriotic grounds. With- 
out that holy book I can see neither the origin nor progress of our 
American institutions. It is their corner stone. It may not be 
mentioned in them, but they would have been impossible without it, 
and will crumble as soon as it is removed. Sectaries may find 
their hostile texts in it. With sectarian interpretations the public 
schools have nothing todo. But the young in them should never be 
deprived of the wholesome influence of its precious precepts and 
sovereign truths. 
The morality of all systems pales before its Divine light. Be- 
sides, no other book exhibits such high appreciation of whatever is 
picturesque or grand in nature as the Bible; no other book contains 
such exquisitely beautiful allusions to whatever is fitted to excite 
admiration and please the taste, in field and. forest, in air and earth 
and sea. There is no inspiration of genius, no brilliancy of lan- 
guage, or power of description; no tenderness, pathos, energy,
-P-A-G-E-48
48 
simplicity, in poetry and eloquence, such as the old Hebrew proph- 
ets left us. Shakspeare and Milton are immeasurably inferior, in 
all which constitutes their glory, to David and Job; while the 
eloquence of Ezekiel, and Isaiah, and Moses, and John, whether 
for clegance or force, whether for argument, persuasion, or invec- 
tive, leaves all the orators of ancient and modern times, far be- 
hind. 
Those who wish to pursue this topic are invited to look at Appen~- 
dix, [B,] where I have quoted for the benefit of those making in- 
quiries upon the subject an able summary statement of the legal 
opinions which prevail upon it and relative questions. 
As a Christian people we certainly ought not to come short of the 
liberality shown in the royal speech of Madagascar’s queen on the oc- 
casion of her coronation: “This is my word to you in regard to the 
praying: it is not enforced, it is not hindered, for God made you.”’ 
INSTRUCTION IN SCHOOL. 
However important the direct instruction in school may be, it 
should not be misunderstood as comprehending all of merit which 
the teacher does. Such a misconception throws instruction out of 
its true relations. The machinery of school work would go wrong. 
The mental character produced would not be symmetrical or natural, 
but would be more or less misdirected or deformed. Neithor should 
instruction be degraded, and equal harm done by its neglect or its 
incorrectness, or want of logical handling of the subjects presented, 
or of proper adaptation to the minds under training. 
How is it that any one pretending to be a musician and has 
called around him his hearers, but, on attempting to play shows no 
knowledge of his instrument is so promptly condemned; and yet 
persons are put forward as teachers, to play the harp of a thousand 
strings, who know nothing about it. The only explanation is the 
false or incorrect ideas abroad in regard to what instruction in 
school and out of it should be. The human mind reccives the 
knowledge that it works up in the process of its growth, first, by 
observation; second, by reading ; third, from the living teacher. 
All of this acquisition has its value only as it is related to the 
progress of life, and is worked into its woof and warp. It is not by 
pouring out much before the child the greatest amount of knowl-
-P-A-G-E-49
49 
edge or reading that gives him the greatest growth, any more than 
the great quantity of rain that falls will assure the greatest growth 
of the plant. Too much, as well as too little, may be destructive, 
The character and amount must be regulated by the power of ab- 
sorption or digestion and use. The teacher should know all that 
is in the text books, and more too; and should, besides, be able to 
give instruction that is not merely correct and sufficient, but that is 
also fitted to the pupil’s capacity and his methods of apprehension. 
Ruskin’s remark concerning art is equally true of teaching: 
“Exactly in proportion as an artist is certain of his end, will 
he be swift and simple in his means.” The teacher should be 
full of his subject, but fuller of his work. He is to make 
men and women. Coming short of this, his instruction fails, 
though he has ali knowledge; attaining this, he succeeds, though 
he understands only the one subject presented. / 
It is not enough to fill the memory with masses of facts. The- 
most healthful condition and growth of the human mind has an in-. 
herent degree of forgetfulness. The memory should be carefully. 
trained and stored; but something, day by day, passes out of im- 
mediate recollection in the most growing intellects. 
Dr. Wilbur well remarks, “That in the early stages of educa-- 
tion, mental steps are by no means ‘mental acquirements;’ since 
in these, as in the higher stages, a thousand facts and ideas having 
been used as steps in the development procéss, may be laid-aside. 
and forgotten. For what a miserable affair a man would be, ifvhe 
could remember or did remember, all the facts and ideas that helped’ 
in his growth towards manliness.” 
All instructors should aim to impart to the pupil the art of self 
instruction. 
The day of schools will soon pass for each child. Their instrue- 
tion should not destroy, but increase his power to observe, think and 
judge for himself. 
Object Lessons will be given him through life. This is the way 
Providence teaches. ‘The Great Teacher, so gladly heard by the 
common people, taught in parables. He spoke to the eye and ear. 
The habit of heeding such teaching, is the habit needed through 
life. Their eminent usefulness is well illustrated in the career of 
Franklin. It not only gives readiness and correctness of observa- 
tion, but it rouses, directs and disciplines the powers of inquiry and 
reason. .
-P-A-G-E-50

Says Miss Edgeworth, ‘The first thing that strikes us, in look- 
ing over Dr. Franklin’s works, is the varicty of his observations 
upon different subjects. Wherever he happened to be, in a boat, in 
a mine, in a printer’s shop, in a crowded city, or in the country, in 
Europe or America, he displayed the same activity of observation. 
When anything, however trifling, struck him, which he could not 
account for, he never rested till he had traced the effect to its cause.’” 
We get an instructive explanation of this in his autobiography. 
Speaking of his father, “ At his table,” he says, “he liked to have, 
as often as possible, some sensible friend or neighbor; and always 
took care to start some ingenious or useful topic of discourse, which 
might tend to improve the minds of his children, By this means 
he turned our attention to what was good, just and prudent, in the 
conduct of life.” 
James Corrie, Principal of the Edinburgh Training College, well 
says: 
“ The predominant aspect of the object lesson is the mental exercise it gives; 
it is meant to awaken the intelligence, and to cultivate the different phases of ob- 
servation, conception, and taste, without which little satisfactory progress can be 
“made in their future education. It is a disciplining, not a utilitarian, process; 
the information it gives is a means, not an end. 
‘The range of this department of instruction is exceedingly comprehensive. 
It draws its material from all the branches of knowledge, dealing with. things 
which can interest the child or exercise his mind. Thus, it is Natural History for 
children; for it directs their attention to aniatuls of all classes, domestic and 
others, their qualities, habits, and uses; to trees and plants aud flowers; to the 
metals and other minerals, which, from their properties, are in constant use. It 
is Physical Science for children; for it leads them to observe the phenomena of 
the heavens, sun, moon and stars, the seasons, with the light and heat which make 
the changes of the weather, and the properties of the bodies which furm the mass 
of matter around us. It is Domestic Economy for children; for it exhibits to 
them the things and processes daily used in their homes, avd the way to use them 
rightly. It is Industrial and Social Economy for children; for it describes the 
various trades, processes in different walks of art, and the arrangements as to the 
division of labor which society has sanctioned for carrying these on in harmony 
and mutual dependence,” 
In every subject the teacher should aim to use the eye of the 
pupil, as far as possible, as an aid; the chart and blackboard in 
teaching the alphabet; the blackboard and numeral frame, and 
specimeus of forms and solids, in teaching arithmetic; globes and 
maps, and the face of nature around, in teaching geography. 
Thoroughness.—Everything should be well done. Each step 
of progress should be intelligently taken. Subjects should be in-
-P-A-G-E-51
51 
vestigated thoroughly. Reviews should be frequent. The habit of 
pupils, when they are far enough advanced, writing out their un- 
derstanding of a subject, is very useful. 
Attention to the Lower Studies—So called, is an imperative 
necessity. Too many parents would put their children to college 
before they are ready to leave the nursery; as a consequence, 
many institutions are called colleges, whose students would not pass 
examination in some of the better primary schools. There is too 
much predisposition to big-headedness in our times. It is a fatal 
disease, at whatever age it attacks a person. Education should be 
specially guarded against it. Many attempt to talk French, who 
cannot talk good English. Our mother-tongue is murdered, and 
some college study deified. The free schools, directed by the 
people, are the very ones to abolish this folly, and make good English 
more fashionable for our youth than bad Spanish, and bad spelling, 
bad grammar and outlandish pronunciation, so disreputable, [See 
Appendiz,| that no amount of college and university diplomas can 
render them respectable. No doubt one cause of a prevailing dis- 
taste for primary studies is a miserable manner of teaching them. 
Proper progress in the theory and practice of teaching will remove 
this excuse, and render it impossible among those long in the im- 
proved schools. 
EDUCATION. “ 
These facts and considerations point to a system of schools in 
which education is something more than being in school so many 
months, or merely having good houses or good teachers, or a set of 
good school officers. It contemplates education as a necessary 
function of life. The human soul does not exist, and cannot exist, 
without it. Every sight seen, every sound heard, every thought 
acquired or imagined, remembered or forgotten, every influence felt 
or exerted, has its effect upon the soul, and so educates it, disciplines 
it, develops its powers for good or evil. Education is coterminous 
with life. It begins with the first breath, and can only end with 
the last throb of existence. All human powers are subject to its 
laws. It does not, therefore, begin, and cannot end, with schools. 
It will go on, whether neglected, or wisely or indifferently directed. 
Its power is more effective in youth, when the mind and character
-P-A-G-E-52
52 
are in a formative condition. Parents, nations, and all propagand- 
ists, act upon this fact: “As the twig is bent, the tree is inclined.” 
They seek to make the boy and the girl what they would have the 
man and the woman. They consider education “whatever tends to 
train up to a healthy and graceful activity our mental and bodily 
powers, our affections, manners and habits.’ “The education,” 
says an able writer, “required for the people is that which will give 
them the full command of every faculty of body and mind; which 
will call into play their powers of observation and reflection ; which 
will make thinking and reasonable beings of the mere creatures of 
impulse, prejudice and passion; that which, in a moral sense, will 
give them objects and pursuits, and habits of conduct favorable to 
their own happiness, and to that of the community of which they 
will form a part; which, by multiplying the means of rational and 
intellectual enjoyment, will diminish the temptation to vice and 
sensuality; which, in the social relations of life, and as connected 
with objects of legislation, will teach them the identity of the indi- 
vidual with the general interests; that which, in the physical 
sciences, will make them masters of the secrets of nature, and give 
them powers which even now tend to elevate the moderns to a 
higher rank than the demi-gods of antiquity.” 
This is no sham, by whomsoever it is undertaken. No acquisi- 
tion of mere accomplishments, nothing artificial, can be substituted 
for it and equal it. It answers the demand for a sound mind and a 
healthy body, and meets the condition of Emergon’s declaration, 
that, “The first thing in every efficient man is a fine animal.” In- 
tellectually, it corresponds to the soundest philosophy of human 
development. Says the learned Prof. Henry: “The several facul- 
ties of the human mind are not simultaneously developed; and in 
educating the individual, we ought to follow the order of nature 
and adapt the instruction to the age and mental development of the 
pupil. The laws which govern the growth and operations of the 
human mind are definite, and as general in their application as those 
which apply to the material universe; and it is evident that a sys- 
tem of education must be based upon a knowledge and application 
of these laws. The aims and methods of this education answer the 
conditions of that wise remark of Sir William Hamilton, in which he 
declares: ‘The primary principle is the determination of the pupil 
to self-activity, the doing nothing which he is not able to do for him- 
self”” It permits no misdirection or misuse of any human capacity.

Educational Agencies—Are numerous. The press and forum, 
the pulpit and bar, the lecture and conversation, are classed among 
them by all. But the work is specially intrusted to others. 
The Family—ls the first, and, for a time in each person’s life, 
the exclusive agency; and no educator can be expected to do his 
fullest and best work without the aid of the family. Indeed it is 
society and state in miniature. There the child meets with the ex- 
ercise of authority, either in civilized or savage life. Patriarchal 
and aristocratic conditions of society attempt little education aside 
from what is domestic. Wealth and seclusion may give the family 
school, by itself, considerable success. But, as society is organized 
with us, the child is not safely out of the cradle before he is under 
educational influences entirely beyond the control of his parents. 
He begins to pass more of his time with others than in the home 
circle. The home training may be never so good, its results are by 
no means insured. Alas! how many families feel this: A city 
missionary visited an unhappy young man in jail, waiting his trial 
for a state prison crime. “Sir,” said the prisoner, tears running 
down his cheeks, “T had a good home education; it was my street 
education that ruined me. I used to slip out of the house, and go 
off with the boys in the street. In the street I learned to lounge ; 
in the street I learned to swear; in the street I learned to smoke; 
in the street I learned to gamble; in the street I learned to pilfer. 
QO, sir, it is in the street the devil lurks to work the ruin of the 
young.” 
The Church Schools—Come to aid the parent. They may be 
ever so excellent; yet, as every community is divided into various 
sects, and as some do not adhere to any sect, it would be impossible 
for one church or all churches to do effectually what the family fails 
to accomplish. 
Even church preaching on the Sabbath reaches but a small fraction 
of the people. How much less adequately could they furnish day 
school instruction and training? Besides, they would, from the 
first, intensify theological differences and partisan contentions. 
Schools under Private Control, are organized to do what 
neither the family nor the church accomplishes. These institutions 
are numerous and various in character. Parents may associate 
themselves together and employ a teacher for their children—or a
-P-A-G-E-54
5A 
teacher may open a school on his own responsility and admit pupils 
on the payment of iuition fees. Several persons may get an act 
of incorporation as a Board of Trustees for an academy, college, or 
university, and regulate the studies, matriculation, curriculum, and 
graduation, charging such rates as they decide, whether they have 
endowments or not. These institutions are sometimes established 
by the church. They have accomplished vast results. 
The independent colleges of America have placed all the interests 
of the country under obligations to them. But when all these have 
done their utmost, a great portion of the people remains wholly 
uneducated; and this portion, instead of itself raising and bringing 
up others, sicks and drags down others into barbarism. The coun- 
tries where all these systems prevail illustrate this statement. 
Joseph Kay, Esq., M.A., Barrister-at-law, an acknowledged au- 
thority, in a work on ‘The Social Condition of England and Europe,” 
gives these items in his summary: 
“1, It has been calculated that there are at the present day in 
England and Wales, nearly 8,000,000 persons who cannot read. 
“2. OF all the children in England and Wales between the ages of 
five and fourteen, more than half are riot attending school. 
“3. Even of the class of farmers there are great numbers who can- 
not read and write.” 
It is estimated by the highest authority, that in England more 
than two millions of children are left to grow up in total ignorance. 
Before the Parliamentary Committees, the testimony has been most 
startling. Observe the following: “I am vicar of a parish which 
contains a population of 10,000 souls, and I grieve to say there is 
but one school-room in it.” “I am curate,” says another, “of a 
poor parish of 3,000 of population, and there is no school-house of 
any kind.” And again, “The population of the village of which I 
am an incumbent, is not less than 20,000; there is no free school in 
the whole place; hundreds of children receive no education what- 
ever.” Such is the evidence from innumerable witnesses. 
When Horace Mann returned from Europe, he said, “England is 
the only country among the nations of Europe, conspicuous for its 
civilization and resources, which has not, and never has had, any 
system for the education of its people. It is the country,” he adds, 
“where, incomparably beyond any other, the greatest and most ap- 
palling social contrasts exist; where, in comparison with the intel-
-P-A-G-E-55
55 
ligence, wealth, and refinement of what are called the higher classes, 
there is more ignorance, poverty, and crime among the lower. . . . 
And yet in no country in the world have there been men who have 
formed nobler conceptions of the power, and elevation, and blessed- 
ness that come in the train of mental cultivation; and in no country 
have there been bequests, so numerous and munificent as in England. 
Stil, owing to the inherent vice and selfishness of their system, or 
their no system, there is no country in which so little is effected, 
compared with the expenditure of means; and what is done only 
tends to separate the different classes of society more and more 
widely from each other.” 
Such was the opinion of a candid and accurate observer twenty 
years ago. The samo testimony is given by Professor Arnold, of 
Oxford, to-day—one of the most candid, clear-sighted and truthful 
of men; English by birth, culture and:taste; associated as a scholar 
and man of letters with students in the University. And yet, with 
this natural bias, he plainly declares to his countrymen, “Our mid- 
dle classes are the worst educated in the world;” and, speaking of 
the more deplorable population, he calls them an “obscure embryo, 
moving in darkness; . . . the immense working class, now so with- 
out a practical passage to all the joy and beauty of life!—England,” 
he says, “has not yet undertaken to put the means of education 
within the people’s reach.—I should mislead the English reader,” 
he says, “if I should Jet him think that I found in France, a schoo)- 
less multitude, like the 2,250,000 of England.” There are ‘over 
17,000 schoolless children” in Manchester alone; and, ‘in London, 
it is estimated that there are some 200,000 who, ignorant and de- 
graded, are neither at school nor at work.” 
But, aside from the most destitute, Arnold eloquently pleads for 
the middle classes as well. ‘‘The aristocratic classes in England 
may, perhaps, be well content to rest satisfied with their Eton and 
Harrow, but the middle classes in England have every reason not 
to rest content with their private schools. The State can do a great 
deal better for them.” He is convinced that important movements 
in England are near at hand. “Undoubtedly,” he says, “we are 
drawing on towards great changes.’’ It is almost certain, he writes, 
that the English people ‘will throw off the tutelage of aristocracy. 
The masses of the people in this country,” he says, “are preparing 
to take a much more active part than formerly in controlling its 
destinies. The time has arrived when it is becoming impossible for
-P-A-G-E-56
56 
the aristocracy of England to conduct and wield the English nation 
any longer. The superiority of the upper class over all others is 
no longer so great; the willingness of the others to recugnize that 
superiority, is no longer so ready. While it is losing its power to 
give to public affairs its own bias and direction, it is losing also its 
influence on the spirit and character of the people which it long ex- 
ercised. The course taken in the next fifty years,” he writes, “by 
the middle classes of this nation will probably give a decisive turn 
to its history.’ Calmly, considerately, urgently, he argues for a 
wider, and more adequate education; pressing the subject home as 
the duty and necessity of the times. 
What can bedone? The whole people are interested. Some form 
of action must be devised in which all of the people can take part and 
be assured of benefit. 
The People Establish Schools for themselves through the 
State. Every other form of action is defective by its own limi- 
tations. ‘The very child unreached may be the one designed by 
Providence to do the most good or harm in the community. There 
is one agency expected to look to the good of all the people; for 
that purpose it exists, and its various functions are exercised. This 
agency is the Nation, or State. 
COMPATIBLE FOR THE NATION TO'EDUCATE. 
Noczhing in the nature of education is incompatible with the ob- 
jects for which the Nation or State exists. Every conception of 
national well-being accords with the purposes of educating the 
young. ‘This is illustrated by all the ideas of benefitting the peo- 
ple which have characterised the great minds of the past. A cen- 
tral idea in the political economy of the Theocracy was the teach- 
ing of the ycung in the doctrines of duty. Alexander the Great 
when he would most benefit his people, favored the founding of 
schools and libraries ; so did Peter the Great. Mahommed enjoined 
the teaching of the Koran, and schools were the chief jewels in the 
crowns of some of his followers. Constantine, Alfred of England, 
Charlamange of France, all are conspivtuous illustrati ns of the 
consistency of national direction of education with the nature of 
government, Macaulay tersely declares: ‘The right to hang in- 
cludes the right to educate.”
-P-A-G-E-57
5T 
Education is the readiest means by which a nation can 
benefit its people. Governments are established for the general 
welfare. For their own preservation they may take the property 
and the life of the subject. For the general good they establish 
laws, fix penalities, and have officers to adjudge and enforce the 
laws. For this purpose they require each citizen to pyy # tax from 
the income of his toil, or the profits of his wealth. The objects for 
which revenues are collected and expended are numerous. . 
In this compact each individual surrenders up something which 
would be his in a condition of solitude, or of unorganized society, 
for the liberty and security to person and property which he is to 
enjoy. He pays a tax for roads, though he may never pass over 
them; he pays a tax for courts, though he may never have a case 
in one. If every man was a law to himself, each would know and 
do what was right towards every other, and there would be little 
need of the present vast and complicated machinery of governments. 
But this is not possible to human society. Laws must not only be 
made and the expense of making them be met by the whole body 
of the people and of the entire property benefited, but there must 
be an executive to enforce them, sometimes armed with an army 
and navy; and all this expense must be met also. More than this, 
there must be a complicated system of adjustment of differences, 
and detection and punishment of crime to make communities en- 
durable, or property valuable. Vice, crime, misdirected human 
activity, is the source of these expenses; and experience has found 
that they are susceptible of being increased or diminished by the 
way in which the young are trained. As virtue increases, all the 
expenses occasioned by crime diminish. If the State may punish, 
and must take all steps necessary to do it, it may certainly, with 
equal propriety, exert its power to prevent crime, and save the ex- 
pense of punishing it. It does not hesitate to step in and punish 
the parent that treats cruelly or takes the life of his child. If the 
parent would destroy the moral life of the child—teach it beggary, 
and theft, or murder—has not the State an equal right to enter in 
and prevent it? Nay, is it not bound to do it? If a person is 
abroad with an infectious disease, such as small pox, the laws shut 
him up, and all say well done. But if a child is abroad with a 
moral infection—for a single neglected girl or boy may have the vices 
and offer the temptations which will ruin the best child of the best 
trained families—and some one says “Educate them, train them for
-P-A-G-E-58
58 
something better, or if you cannot do that, you can save the ruin 
of other youth,” we are at once met with the sage declaration that it 
is wrong to tax one man’s property to educate another’s children. 
If the State only makes laws for the enforcement of equality be- 
tween man and man, and leaves all the sources of vice and crime 
to voluntary efforts for their prevention, it exposes itself to an indefi- 
nite increase of their evils and their charges. It might as wel 
leave the punishment of crimes or‘the entire machinery of govern- 
ment to the voluntary efforts of good men. Education for the 
young, universal and free, reaches the root of the evil. It benefits 
the families of the best, by making the success of their home-train- 
ing possible. It benefits the poor and outcast by training them in 
virtue and intelligence, instead of allowing them to go down toa 
life of brutish degradation. 
Lord Macaulay in one of his speeches advocating the education 
of the people as the first concern of the State, declares that it “is 
not only an efficient means” for promoting and obtaining that 
which all allow is the main end of government, but that it is “the 
most efficient, humane, civilized; and in all respects the best means 
of attaining that end.” 
AMERICAN IDEAS AND METHODS. 
There is no American characteristic more. striking to foreigners 
than the attention to the education of the young in this country. 
The benevolent and philanthropic find no other field so likely to 
produce rich returns for their charity, Statesmen know no oppor- 
tunities so full of returns for their efforts to be repeated down the 
progress of ages. The monuments of brass and stone pass away 
like strokes on the sand, but work on the immortal mind becomes 
part of itself and partakes of its own immortality. 
Lord Thomas Babington Macaulay says of the fathers of our 
liberty:— 
“Though their love of freedom and conscience was illimitable and indestructi- 
ble, they could see nothing servile or degadirg in the principle that the State 
should take upon itself the charge of the education of the people. In the year 
1642 they passed their first legislative enactment on this subjec, in the preamble 
of which they distinctly pledged themselves to this principle——that education 
was a matter of the deepest possible interest to all nations and to all communi- 
es; and,‘that, as such, it was in an eminent degree deserving of the peculiar 
attention of the State.
-P-A-G-E-59
59 
“J have peculiar satisfaction in referring,” he adds, “to the case of America 
What do we find to be the principle of America, and of /all the greatest men she 
has produced? ‘EDUCATE THE PEOPLE,’ was the first admonition addressed by 
Penn to the Commonwealth he founded. ‘EDUCATE THE PEOPLE, was the un- 
ceasing exhortation of Jefferson. ‘EDUCATE THE PEOPLE, was the last legacy 
of Washington to the Republic of the United States.” 
Who does not linger in a charmed reverence around these words 
of almost prescient wisdom? Said Washington: “ Promote, as an 
object of primary importance, institutions for the general diffusion 
of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a government 
gives force to public opinion, it is essential that public opinion 
should be enlightened.” 
The elder Adams declared in his Inaugural Message— 
“The wisdom and generosity of the Legislatures, in making liberal appropria- 
tions in money for the benefit of schools, academies and colleges, is an equal 
honor to them and their constituents, a proof of their veneration for letters and 
science, and a portent of great and lasting good to North and South America, 
and to the world. Great is truth—great is liberty—great is humanity—and 
they must and will prevail.” 
Instead of quoting Mr. Jefferson’s declarations, I give, as more 
clearly showing his ideas, an extract from his autobiography. 
He says: 
“We thought that on this subject, a systematical plan of general education 
should be proposed, and I was requested to undertake it. I accordingly pre- 
pared three bills for the Revisal, proposing three distinct grades of education, 
reaching all classes. Ist. Elementary schools, for all children generally, rich 
and poor. 2d. Colleges for a middle degree of instruction, calculated for the 
common purposes of life, and such as would be desirable for all who were in 
easy circumstances. And 3d, an ultimate grade for teaching the sciences gener- 
ally, and in their highest degree. The first bill proposed to lay off every 
county in Hundreds or Wards, of a proper size and population for a school, in 
which reading, writing and common arithmetic should be taught; and that the 
whole State should be divided into twenty-four districts, in each of which should 
be a school for classical learning, grammar, geography, and the higher branches 
of numerical arithmetic. The second bill proposed to amend the constitution 
of William sha Mary College; to enlarge its sphere of science; and to make it, 
in fact, a University. The third was for the establishment of a library. 
“And in the Elementary bill, they inserted 2 provision which completely de- 
feated it, for they left it to the court of each county to determine for itself when 
this Act should be carried into execution within their county. One provision 
of the bill was, that the expense of these schools was to be borne by the inhabi- 
tants of the county, everyone in proportion to his general tax rate. This would 
throw on wenlth the education of the poor; and the Justices, being generally of 
the more wealthy class, wree unwilling to incur the burden, and I believe it was 
not suffered to commence in a single county.” 
Said the benevolent and far-sighted Wm. Penn, “That which
-P-A-G-E-60
60 
makes a good constitution must keep it, namely: men of wisdom 
and virtue; qualities that because they descend not with worldly in- 
heritance, must be carefully propagated by a virtuous education of 
youth, for which spare no cost ; for by such parsimony ALL THAT IS 
SAVED 1S LOST.” 
Chancellor Kent declared, that “The parent who sends his son 
into the world uneducated, defrauds the community of a lawful citi- 
zen, and bequeaths to it a nuisance.” 
Hon. Edward Everett found no more fit subject for his eloquence, 
and observes: 
I know not to what we can better liken the strong appetence of the mind for im- 
provement than to hunger and thirst after knowledge and truth, nor how can we 
better describe the province of education than to say, it does that for the intellect 
which is done for the body, when it receives the care and nourishment which are 
necessary for its growth, health and strength. 
From this comparison I think 1 derive new views of the importance of education, 
It is now a solemn duty, a tender, sacred trust. 
What?! feed a child’s body and let his sou] hunger! pamper his limbs aud starve 
his faculties! 
Plant the earth, cover a thousand hills with your droves of cattle, pursve the fish 
to their hiding p!aces in the sea, and spread ont. your wheat fields across the plains 
in order to supply the wants of that body, whicl will soon he as cold and senseless 
* as the poorest clod, and let the pure spiritual essence within you, with a!l its glo- 
rious cafac ties for improvement, languish and pine! What! build factories, turn 
in rivers upon the water-wheels, unchain the imprisoned spirits of steam, to weave 
a garment for the body, and let the soul remain unadorned and naked! 
What! send out your vessels to the farthest ocean, and make battle with the 
monsters of the deep, in order to obtain the means of lighting up your dwellings 
and workshops, and prolong the hours of labor fur the text that perisheth, and 
permit that vital spark which God has kind/ed, which he has entrusted to our care, 
to be fanned into a bright and heavenly flame; permit it, I say, to languish and 
go out ! 
The orators and statesmen of Tennessee, however widely differing 
in sentiment, have vied with others in the exaltation of education. 
The Hon, Neill 8. Brown recently said in an eloquent welcome of 
the National Teachers’ Association to the State:— 
The teacher forms the warrior and the statesman, The efforts of the teacher are 
like bread scattered upon the water—they will be gathered somewhere some time 
hence, He had no hesitation in placing the judicious, weil-trained teacher in the 
front rank of society. It is by the beautiful law of contrast that. we come to a true 
appreciation of what is good and beautiful. Let us take, by way of illustration, 
heinhabitants of Africa and compare them with those of Europe and America, 
and the contrast at once furnishes overwhelming evidence of the superiority of the 
magic power of education. The one has made no progress, built no cities; no 
steamers ply their rivers, no ships of theirs cover the seas; their voice amid the busy
-P-A-G-E-61
61 
hive of mankind is silent. With the other there is life, thrift and enterprise, 
whether you find them on the highlands or scattered in the vales of Italy, or far 
out on the ccean in the paths of exploration. All this because they have been ed- 
ucated. Whenever ignorance and vice become predominant our government goes 
down. It is particularly here in this country that the necessity of education is 
most imperative A government founded oh the will of the people must be sup- 
ported by the virtue and intelligence of the people, for it would be as impossible 
to perpetuate a government like this without virtue and knowledge, as to perpetu- 
ate the natural laws of the earth without the sun. In behalf of the committee, of 
which he was one, and of the citizens in general, he extended a hearty welcome to 
the members of the Teachers’ Association. 
Hon. W.'G. Brownlow, United States Senator, when Governor, 
addressed the following letter to the teachers of the State: 
Srare or Tennesser, Execurtive DEpaRTMENT, 
. NasuvitLe, November 14, 1867. 
Hon. Wm. Bosson, President Tennessee Teachers’ Association, Ladies and Gentlemen 
of the Association : 
The condition of my voice precludes my addressing you in person, but 
I take the liberty to assure you of my appreciation of the work you have to do, and 
of the difficulties you bave to overcome, end to extend to you the assurance of my 
sympathy and co-operation. | 
‘he thoughts of the people are turned anxiously toward the education of their 
children, They expect something more universal and better than they have ever 
had. 
Nothing is plainer than that the destructive shock from which we are recovering 
did not spring upina night, It was the growth of years, in the education of 
public sentiment. We have upon us the evils left behind by the war, its wastes 
and its poverty, its ignorance, vice and crime, and the remaining hostile sentiments 
out of which it grew. 
Burdened with these ills, we must rebuild the State. It has been my deltermina- 
tion to resist all rebuilding on a foundation of sand, and to allow no flaw in the 
rising structure of State 
Our legislators have wisely removed the traces of inequalities from our laws, 
and souglit to place them on the corner-stone of justice. These laws and their 
administration in the courts, and the spirit of the times, are uniting their infiu- 
ence for the development of sentiments fitted to restore public confidence, peace, 
prosperity and patrioti-m 
The press and pulpit, and institutions of learning, are adding their influence. 
But the work they leave undone looks to you, beseeching you, by all the wastes 
and ruins of the past, and by ailthe uplifted hands of the rising generation, to do 
wisely and well the school training of every child in the State, We can afford to 
be indifferent to no child, however humbly born His brains are not measured 
by the poverty of his father’s purse, He will grow up either to produce public 
virtue and wealth, or to destroy them. If he is not trained in your schools, be

the courts, and his punishment in the prison. 
Your meeting is fraught with great consequence in determining the spirit of in- 
struction to be given in the free schools about to be opened in the State.
-P-A-G-E-62

We must not expect our schools to be better than our teachers. And their quick_ 
ning of the minds of our youth must determine the character of our citizens for 
the observance of law and for the production of wealth in the various pursuits of 
life. 
Well conducted schools must furnish that skillful labor which shall increase ten- 
fold the productions of our rich soil and evoke from our unexplored mines untold 
millions of wealth. 
Thus statesmen expect your labors to give us a system of internal improvements 
more productive than any of a purely material character. Indeed, what you do, 
not only affects all other interests, but in a great measure controls them; and we 
therefore expect you to diminish the burdens of the State, andto multiply every 
individual and public virtue and good. The moment isa critical one. You cannot 
be too sure you are right, nor when you have combined the light of all wisdom on 
your course, can you go ahead with too much courage or step too firm and steady. 
Do not disappoint the better expectations of the public. You work not only for 
your generation and Tennessee, but for other States and generations yet unborn. 
Your labors deserve most liberal compensation; but let no lack in this respect, 
nor any other obstacle, however trying tothe highest elements of character, deter 
you. 
Should you direct the public sentiment of our State to a successful and early 
competition in educational advancement with the best systems of the country, you 
may be sure a people will rise up to call you blessed, and your liberal pecuniary 
compensation will be a matter of course. 
Desiring that you may be successful in seeking for the youth of Tenneesee the 
best culture, I bid you a most hearty God-speed. 
Very respectfully, yours, etc., 
W. G. BROWNLOW. 
The Hon. H. 8. Foote in a brief but learned address before the 
National Teachers Association, said: ‘The reasoning power is 
that which distinguished man from the beasts of creation, and said 
that he thought cultivated or educated reason is that which chiefly 
distinguishes civilized men from savages. In the broad and extended 
views which he took upon the subject, the heart, he thought, was as 
much concerned as the head. Education which only trains, ex- 
pands and invigorates the intellectual nature without imparting cor- 
responding improvement to the moral nature is of very little value 
indeed. Alison, the celebrated English historian, in one of the 
most noted chapters of his immortal work, has, he thought, unfor- 
tunately urged upon his readers, in language remarkable for its elo- 
quence and persuasiveness, that the general effect of education up 
on mankind has been such as to heighten the capacity for commit- 
ting crime of every kind, and especially those of a certain astound- 
ing character, so common in the present age, and which are of a 
nature seeming to demand the exercise of uncommon intellectual 
resources and an amount of science not usually possessed. And he

endeavored to support this discouraging theme not only by reason, 
but by the elaborate Jcitation of recorded instances arising in the 
most civilized countries, which he (the speaker) never could read 
without shuddering and_dismay. Educate the mind of man, culti- 
vate it as highly as you please, strengthen his reasoning powers, 
improve his imagination, invigorate his memory, make him the 
most profound mathematician that the world has known, imbue him 
with all geographical knowledge, bring him into familiar acquaint- 
ance with chemistry, botany, mineralogy and all other sciences; 
teach him all the spoken and unspoken languages of the earth; and 
leave the moral faculties in an uncultivated state; neglect to ‘plant 
the virtues which do most dignify human existence in his immortal 
soul, and you will only aid in the formation of a monster, a sort of 
modern Cyclops, possessed of wondrous powers for mischief, and 
devoid alike of inclination and of power to do aught that is calcula- 
ted to add to the true happiness and dignity of the human race. 
“J am desirous that, in the formation of the youthful character 
by our practical educationalist, care shall be taken by them to see 
that the seeds of vice, of prejudice, of low and groveling selfishness 
are not sown at all in the rich and prolific soil with which they have 
to deal; or, if sown by other hands, that they shall be rooted out 
before the growing plant shall have borne its evil fruits. I wish 
that our schools may inculcate love of country, genuine philanthropy, 
concord, benevolence, universal brotherhood, the love of free insti- 
tutions, and the determination to maintain them at all hazards. Our 
noble government itself subsists upon two pillars alone—one is in- 
telligence, and the other is virtue. It is our duty, and particularly 
the duty of our teachers of youth, to strengthen and solidify both 
these pillars of our national prosperity and happiness to the full 
extent of their power. From the union of virtue and intelligence 
flow all our social blessings, all- our individual dignity, all our na- 
tional felicity and honor. 
“‘ Whenever mind or moral capabilities are found existing, there 
itis the duty of the government to see that the blessings of educa- 
tional learning shall be supplied, without regard to lineage, race or 
sect. Every particle of force which belongs to a State or nation 
should be made available for the nation’s welfare.” 
Hon. Horace Maynard, addressing the State Teachers’ Conven- 
tion at Lookout Mountain, is reported as follows :
-P-A-G-E-64
‘64 
“J may, in the estimation of the assembly, be thought to adhere to the old rather 
than to the new. But the old is sot aliogether to be rejected. The two thoughts 
are old, ‘each your boy what he will use when he becomes a man;’ and again 
there is no royal rond to knowledge. In our State we have not been indifferent to 
education For years we have hada system of Common School education in our 
laws. The State has professed to care for her children, We have now a new sys- 
tem on trivl, Ler all the sacts in every department appear, because the day that 
takes away the light of education from the child will beadark one. Send tre 
child to school; yea, require him to go by law. He is the child of the State. The 
State protects itself in so doing. 
“Take the law. Professional men have come to the bar who were not, and never 
could be lawyers. So it is with the pulpit, A very learned minister may preach 
his people to sleep, while another net nearly so gifted will edify and interest his 
congregation. This is a law which the teacher can not escape. If he be a teacher 
by nature, let him teach on successfully If he find himself unsuccessful, let him 
endeavor to find employment in some uw ther calling. 
“In closing, let me say, see to it that education be provided for all. I care not 
what color, whether the child be black or white, he should receive an education, 
Any man is the better if educated, than if ignorant. It 1s a mistake to suppose 
that the counterfeiter, the convict, or the burglar is the educated nan, Your wicked 
and abandoned men are your ignorant men, Have schools provided for all at the 
general expense. Learn by your failures, as wellasby your successes. Help your 
teachers; sustain them, make common eause in the great work, and success will 
erown your efforts. 
“The child has a teacher. Let that teacher separate the substantial from what is 
not. A young man who starts out to teach will make a good teacher if he has the 
root of the matter ia him. If he has nota gift, he will never make a gnod teacher, 
If he has natural gifts, these can be developed by training He may study the best 
modes with ever-increasing growth. The greatest teachers of mankind haye been 
those who have especial gifts. . 
“Kliphalet Nott, of New York, was one of these. He tovk a broken-down’col- 
lege, in New York, and built it up to be one of the most successful in the country 
Under bis instruction some of the most unpromising students, rejected from other 
colleges, became the most prominent men of the country. This leads me to say 
that success in teaching is as much conditioned upon natural gifts as success in 
any other department of effort.” 
GENERALS MARION AND SHERMAN. 
Nor are these forcible views of the educators limited to our civil- 
ians. General Marion held opinions quite as unmistakable as any 
above presented, but I have not his language at hand. 
General Sherman, addressing the assembled alumni at the Dart- 
mouth College Centennial, recently, used the following significant 
words: 
“I feel the eame interest in education that you do. It lessens my task; it les-
-P-A-G-E-65
65 
sens the task of every Governor and of the Chief Justice, when throughout the 
land, in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Florida, and Ohio, schools and colleges 
are founded, and men are taught what law means, what order means, what civil- 
ization means, what refinement means; for it is far easier and more pleasant to 
govern intelligent men than to govern unlettered men. The one acts froma high 
motive and principle, aiding and supporting you in carrying out your purpose 
without confusion; whereas, the other must be driven to it by force. Therefore, 
Thave a personal interest in education. I hope it will pervade all America, and 
when it does there will be no need of armies and very little need of courts.” 
Men that have led armies are not dishonored in leading youth 
to the triumphs of intelligence and virtue over vice and crime. 
But all that has been well said has not been followed by all that 
should have been done. Our National Government has undoubtedly 
been negligent of this essential safeguard of the entire nation. 
National Action and Sentiment.—The following semi-official 
statement is fitted to give every American a consciousness of na- 
tional duties unperformed, of safeguards to the domestic peuce of. 
the country neglected: 
“In that year (1840) there were 549,905 white persons, over 20 years of age, un-- 
able to read or write; which number had increased in 1850 to 962,898, and in 1860 
to 1,126,676. To this number should be added 91,726 free colored illiterate adults, 
and 1,653,800 adult slaves, and we had in 1860 the alarming aggregate of 2,872,- 
1, or nearly 3,000,000 of our adult population to whom a written Constitution is. 
a blank,” 
J observe the statement is published that a recent statistical re- 
port in regard to New Mexico, shows that, out of a population of 
68,516 persons, there are 57,233 who can neither read nor write, 
and that “to-day there is not a single free school for the education 
of a single poor child within the broad expanse of the territory.”’ 
Already it is apparent that the General Government could not 
have hada wiser requirement or expenditure at once on the close of the 
recent war, so destructive to all educational institutions and oppor- 
tunities in the South than to have opened schools for instruction in 
the rudiments of learning throughout the disturbed regions. The 
right that sent the soldier includes the right to send the school- 
master. 
But these omissions of the General Government are not due to a 
want of educational sentiment. ‘This has been strongly and uni- 
formly manifested from the first. On May 20, 1785, an ordinance 
passed Congress with the following provision for education: 
“There shall be reserved the lot No. 16 of every township for the maintenance 
of public schools. 
The Ordinance of 1787 “for the government of the Territory 
5
-P-A-G-E-66
66 
north-west of the River Ohio’’ confirmed the provision of 1785, 
and declared that “religion, morality and knowledge being neces- 
sary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and 
the means of education shall be forever encouraged.” 
In addition to other grants, those for the establishment of Agri- 
cultural Colleges are now conspicuous before the country. March 
2a, 1861, an act establishing, at Washington, a department, was 
approved. That distinguished educator, Hon. Henry Barnard, 
L.L.D., is the Commissioner. All white and colored friends of 
education can address him and receive information. One report 
has been published; others will be forthcoming. [See Appendiz.] 
The national sentiment in favor of universal education was never 
stronger than now. Its practical workings have been left like 
many other interests, to State action. 
State Action.—This vast and fundamental interest was not 
deferred till the organization of States. Many of the colonies 
guarded no interest more closely than that of universal education. 
Each State has an educational history, differing in some features 
from all the others. 
The idea of State action in some form, is so acceptable to the 
popular sentiment, that no one of the States has been, or is, without 
some sort of a system of public schools. 
The necessities of slavery, which so imperatively forbade letters 
and learning to the principal class of laborers, could not effectu- 
ally keep from constitutions and codes provisions for popular edu- 
cation, however it might nullify their practical workings. 
But in States, as fast as slavery disappeared, free universal edu- 
cation has been marked by a progress unparalleled in the annals of 
history. It has proved an interest which no man or class of men 
could attack or injure and retain public approval; and public men 
of whatever partizan affiliations or principles, have, as a result, vied 
with each other in efforts to perfect the free systems of schools, for 
universal education. One class of men go out and another enter 
official positions, but the free schools know no injurious change, but 
keep on the even tenor of their upward way, fighting the battle with 
ignorance, idleness, non-productive labor and crime. Better 
houses are built, better teachers are employed, better plans devised, 
larger taxes levicd, and, in some instances, the other burdens of 
government are reduced to the minimum by the increase of efforts 
for education.
-P-A-G-E-67

In the schools, that intelligence and virtue are secured and uni- 
versally extended among the people, which furnish the eternal vigi- 
lance that is the price of liberty. “A free government,” says 
Machiavelli, “in order to maintain itself free, hath need, every day, 
of some new provision in favor of liberty.” 
This, the American States attempt to do by training every indi- 
vidual, of each generation, for a faithful discharge of his duties to 
himself, his family, and to the nation. The world has taken knowl- 
edge of the results. 
Foreign Testimony.—Matthew Arnold, referring to America, 
alludes to ‘its boundless energy of character,” and ‘its boundless 
field for adventure, where the people have not, unquestionably, been 
enervated by education.”’ ‘I speak,” he adds “with more than 
respect—with warm interest—of a nation of English blood: with 
which rests, in large measure, the future of the world.” 
Dr. Frazer, an able Englishman, sent to this country to report 
on our schools, saw those in Boston, which he desired to transport, 
unchanged, for the benefit of his people athome. [See Appendiz.] 
Historie View.—The colony of Massachusetts Bay was the 
first to adopt most of the principles of education by the people, in 
accordance with State action, which have proved successful in the 
practice of centuries. In 1686, sixteen years after the settlement of 
Boston, the colonyappropriated £400 for the establishment of Har- 
vard College. 
In 1642, it was ordered by the General Court that the proper 
officers of every town shall have “a vigilant eye over their brethren 
and neighbors, to see first, that none of them shall suffer so much 
barbarism in any of their families as not to endeavor to teach by 
themselves, or others, their children and apprentices so much learn- 
ing as may enable them, perfectly to read the English tongue, and 
knowledge of the capital laws; upon penalty of twenty-five shillings 
for each neglect therein.” 
Here is the germ of universal education, provided and enforced by 
the State. 
In the same year, “‘to the end that learning may not be buried 
in the graves of our fathers,’ they enacted that “every township 
increased to the number of fifty householders, shall appoint one to 
teach the children.” They further enacted that “any town in- 
creased to one hundred families’ shall “set up a grammar school, 
where youths can be fitted for the university,’ and in case of neg- 
lect, a penalty “of five pounds per annum,” was affixed.
-P-A-G-E-68
68 . 
Here the legislation is by the colony. The town was to perform 
the duty. A graded system of schools is provided—primary, 
grammar and university—the lower departments sustained by the 
town, and the university by the State. There were no funds to re- 
lieve the burthen; all were sustained by tax. Daniel Meads was 
chosen to “ the office of free schoolmaster in Boston in 1636 ” 
Dorchester, May 30th, 1639, voted to lay a tax on the proprie- 
tors for the maintenance of a school. In the colonial charter of 
1692, the proper “officer or inhabitants,” were required to “take 
effectual care for schoolmasters.” Says Dr. White, their present 
able Secretary of the Board of Education— 
Take from the public schools of Massachusetts the two characteristic fentures of 
entire freedom of attendance, and support by general taxation, and you have at 
once robbed them of their highest value as the means of educating our whole peo- 
ple, and have inflicted an incurable woand on our social and civil State. 
The colonies of Connecticut soon acted, but did not start their 
schools so as to secure them from the pernicious influence of rate 
bills. 
In 1809, Pennsylvania provided by law for the education of the 
poor, gratis. 
The action in Virginia is sufficiently apparent from the quotation 
already made from Mr. Jefferson’s Autobiography. 
These systems contained in germ, the various forms of Sate ac- 
tion until 1834-7. 
The other States adopted some of these forms wholly, or par- 
tially, as precedents. 
New Hampshire followed Massachusetts, and always had free 
schools supported by general tax. 
New York had rate bills. After the lapse of years the several 
grants of lands were so disposed of in many States as to produce a 
fund generally held in trust by the State, the interest to be expended 
annually for schools. . 
The history of education for two centuries after the first action 
named above, presents a varied fortune. Schools were 100 dependent 
upon the teacher or the presence or absence of a school man in the 
neighborhood. : 
The communities generally availed themselves of the advantages 
and teachers obtained skill, so that no other nations could compete 
with ours. The library was a common and important auxiliary. But 
the influx of ignorance from the old world, its increase among na~
-P-A-G-E-69
69 
tives and the evils incident to a population growing rapidly dense, 
aroused many of the most thoughtful men to a conviction that some- 
thing more was needed. 
Revival of Education.—Prussia had adopted a vigorous com- 
pulsory system of education. Its effects were manifest in the im- 
provement of houses, teachers and schools, and in. the intelligence 
and skill of the people. They were studied by American educators. 
Horace Mann, Dr. 0. E. Stowe and Dr. Bache, each gave the coun- 
try a book on the subject of education in Europe. Individuals and 
States published them. A conviction resulted, not only that public 
welfare demanded a better educational machinery, but that it was 
the duty of the State to provide it. The revival in education 
commenced somewhat over thirty years ago. It resulted in estab- 
lishing :— 
Ist. State supervision as a means of improving the schools for 
the people. . 
2d. Educational journals and literature. 
3d... Normal Schools and Teachers’ Institutes for the improve- 
ment of teachers. 
4th. Graded schools. 
5th. City and county supervision. 
6th. The township or civil district as the primary territorial unit 
of organization. , 
Tth. Abolition of all rate bills, and the entire support of the 
schools by tax. 
It would be impossible to give the details in the increase of in. 
telligence and its enjoyments, the decrease of ignorance and its 
evils, the development of skillful industry and the masterly hand- 
ling of the secrets and forces of nature for the promotion of indi- 
vidual and social well being during this period, and the compara- 
tive results in different States as they adopted more or less fully all 
of these great educational improvements for the benefit of their 
people. At best, we can give only hints. Figures convey no ade- 
quate ideas. Yet they must be the basis of our calculations and 
opinions. Kentucky is greatly behind her sister States in edu- 
cational provisions, for her people have ‘ust, by a large majority, 
voted to increase the tax for school purposes. 
Tn presenting arguments in favor of a larger tax, the Hon. L. F. 
Smith, the able and zealous Superintendent of Instruction, publishes 
the following interesting tables :

Educational facts in regard to Tennessee, at that date, were not 
considered worthy of insertion. Her name could only be followed 
by a blank. May it never occur again! To-day, as will be seen by 
reference to the statistics of this report, she has risen in the space 
of two years, amid a sea of troubles, to a position of respectability 
in the number of schools and of pupils. enrolled in them. 
Unable to command time to prepare tables from original sources, 
or even to test those prepared by others, I quote the following as a 
summary statement of the results of educational effort in the re- 
spective States. 
The first compiled from the United States census returns, exhib- 
its the number of persons who can neither read nor write in each 
one thousand of the inhabitants of the respective States :

Having at hand no more recent data containing the industrial 
results in the respective States, I use the following from the report 
of the Secretary of the Treasury on the finances of 1856-57, in 
which the ratio of annual per capita production to each man, wo- 
man and child, white and black, in the respective States, exclusive 
of the gains or earnings of commerce, stood as follows:

Tt has been found that persons who can read and write, are on 
the average, worth twenty-five per cent. more to labor with their 
hands than those who cannot. A higher education greatly increases 
their productiveness of labor. 
Moreover an eminent student reaches the conclusion from the 
statistics of crime and ignorance, that on the average, there are 
fourteen-and-a-half per cent. more chances of the commission of 
crime against the laws among those who cannot read and write, than 
there is among those who can. 
These tables and inferences contain volumes of philosophy. In 
them we see something of the fruit borne by the educational senti- 
ments of the fathers of American civilization. Here are some of 
the trophies of their victories: They not only fought the renewed 
ignorance of each generation with success, but they triumphed 
over the influx of ignorance from all quarters of the globe. In 
their schools they received all nations and all kindreds under the 
heavens, and assimilated them to their own high order of civilization. 
Whatever the adults, fathers and mothers might be, their children 
trained in the American school were no longer any other than an 
American in tastes, habits of thought, principles and purposes. 
But these figures present vast contrasts. They speak by affirma- 
tion of what education is in its high results, and by denial of any 
sinister results to its subject. 
How vast the battle! What an army of teachers are employed 
by those States where success has been most complete! What 
millions of annual expenditure! Yet-all the world pronounces the 
grand triumph cheap. I have sought to present alongside with 
these figures the expenditure of the respective States for all pur- 
poses besides education. 
Further Comparisons.—For the purpose of securing trust- 
worthy ground of comparing in detail the methods and machinery 
by which these results have been secured, I addressed the follow- 
ing inquiries to the Educational Department of the several States:

Hon. Joun Earoy, JR.: 
Dear Sin—Your circular of July 23d, was received a day or two since. 
The several questions therein asked are answered, as follows: 
land 2. The Public Schools of Connecticut are under the general supervision of 
the “State Board of Education,” which consists of the Governor and Lieutenant- 
Governor, '‘exz-offciis,” and four other persons, (one from each Congressional Dis- 
trict,) chosen by the General Assembly for four years, one going out of office each
-P-A-G-E-75
75 
year, but re-eligible to the same position, This Board appoint their Secretary, who 
has the direct and active supervision of the Public Schools. For the detail of his 
daties, as defined by law, I refer you toa pamphlet containing the school laws, 
which I have already mailed to you. See pages 17 and 18 of thatpamphiet. See, 
also, pages 9 to 14 of the “Connecticut School Report for 1863,” which I also mail 
to you. 
8. The Secretary of the Board of Education has one Assistant, who takes charge 
of the office work—such as correspondence, the answering of inquiries, the prepara- 
tion and distribution of blanks and circulars, and the compilation and tabulation 
of returns for the Annual Report to the General Assembly. 
4. This State supervision is found by experience to be essential to the practical 
efficiency of the schoo) system. So large a body needs a head as a guiding force, 
By these means, algo, life and activity are secured, new ideas are diffused, and the 
system of Public Schools accomplishes, at least in part, the good results it is de- 
signed (o secure, 
5. There is (6) no county supervision of schools in this State, but (¢) each town, 
i. @., township, has charge of the schools within its limits. (See page 21 of pam- 
phlet, and onward.) Every town selects a “Board of School Visitors.” (d) Cities, 
as such, have no special arrangements; but the cities of New Haven, Middletown 
and Norwich, conduct their schools according to the provisions of section 39 of the 
school laws, (pages 19 and 20 of the pamphlet.) New Haven also employs a Su- 
perintendent, at a salary of $2,400 a year, and Middletown is beginning to follow 
the example. (a) Each town is usually divided into districts, though such subdivi- 
sion is now discouraged, and the ‘Union of Districts” is earnestly recommended. 
Several towns have abolished districts altogether, and the tendency is now in that 
direction. 
6. The yearly cost of State supervision is about $6,500, including expenses of the 
office for stationery, postage, etc. 
7. The cost of subordinate supervision cannot be given with any accuracy. Act- 
ing Visitors have $2 a day for the time actually employed. If their pay is assumed 
to be, on the average, $100 a year, the total cost would be about $17,000, which is 
probably near the truth, but the lowest pay is not over $20 to $25.a year, and the 
highest is $2,400.

For the exact figures, see Report of 1869, which was sent to you a month or two 
ago, page 18 or 119. 
10. Amount expended by the State, for all purposes other than education for the 
year ending March 31, 1869, $857,148.39, Add to this, for payment of State war 
debt and interest on the same, $305,061.18, 
11. Taking the average number registered, and including in the “cost of tuition” 
the amounts paid for “teachers’ wages,” and for “fuel and incidentals,” the “ av- 
erage monthly cost of tuition” was one dollar, six cents and five mills per child. 
But, taking the average of actual attendance, (which is but 72 per cent. of the average 
number registered,) and the ‘average monthly cost of tuition” was $1.46. 
12. The answer of this question cannot be given; but the cost in private schools 
is from two to five times that in public schools.

18. The Connecticut Normal School was established in 1849, and went into op: 
eration in 1850.. In 1867, by an adroit and unprincipled measure in the Legis! 
ture, it was deprived of funds. The next year the Legislature directed it to bi 
re-opened, and the present year provision was made for that purpose. It will re 
sume its sessions a month hence, Perhaps this statement, and the fact that th 
State gives $7,500 a year to the School, is the best answer to your question. 
Yours, very truly, 
JOHN G. BAIRD, 
Assistant to B. G. Northrop, Sec. Board of Education. 
STATE OF NEW YORK, 
DepartMENT oF Pusiic InsrRucTION, SUPERINTENDENT'S OFFICE, 
ALBANY, August 28, 1869. 
Hon. Joun Earon, Jz., Sup’t Public Instruction, Nashville, Tennessee: 
Srr:—Your Circular of the 23d ultimo, culling for certain information in 
relation to the Common Schools and Common School System of this State has 
been received. The following is submitted in answer: 
1, State Supervision of our Common Schools is exercised by the Superintendent 
of Public Instruction. 
2. The duties of that officer, aside from visiting schools and educational institu- 
tion, are, briefly, the following: To report annually to the Legislature; to appor- 
tion the State school funds among the several counties; to advise and oversee all 
local school officers; to organize Teachers’ Institutes in the several counties; to 
oversee the several Normal Schools, appoint the teachers and apportion the pupils 
thereto, and to prescribe the course of study therein; to hear and decide all ap- 
peals involving questions arising under the School Law; to organize and visit 
Indian Schools on the several reservations; to visit and inspect the Institutions 
for the Dea 1.4 Dum), and the Kb: n }, ete., ate. 
3. The Superintendent is assisted by a deputy, and “as many clerks as he may 
deem necessary”—now four in number. 
4. The result of State supervision is to establish a degree of uniformity in the 
manner of conducting the Common Schools; to create a uniform system of re- 
ports from the several districts; to advance the standard of qualification on the 
part of teachers; to insure the maintenance of schools in every district for at 
least twenty-eight weeks in each year; and to hold local schovl officers to the 
proper performance of their official duties. 
5, Local supervision is exercised by the following named officers: (a) In every 
county, by oneor more School Commissioners; (b) In every city, by the Board of 
Education, and the City Superintendent of Schools; (c) In every district, by the 
Trustees, or Board of Educat on. We have nosystem of town supervision, al- 
though the Supervisor and Town Clerk have each certain duties to perform in re- 
lation t. the schools. 
6. By means(of local supervision, teachers are licensed, employed and paid; the 
schools are visited and inspected; the necessary blanks and books are distributed; 
the proper reports made to the State Department; the school money distributed in 
proper proportion among the several districts of the respective counties; and all 
nevessary loval schoul taxes are levied and collected.
-P-A-G-E-77
TT 
7, The estimated yearly expense to the State of the Department of Public In- 
struction, including salaries and printing, is $35,000. 
8. The yearly salaries of the several School Commissioners amount i in the ag- 
gregate. to $118,000. Supervison in the several cities of the State costs, probably, 
$75,000 per annum. School district officers receive no pay, with the exception 
of the Collector, who is entitled to from one to five per cent. collection fees, 
9. The State appropriation for the support of Common Schools, exclusive of 
appropriations for Normal Schools, Teachers’ Institutes, and the Department of 
Public Instruction, is $2,520,000. The amount received from local sources for the 
support of schools, is, $7,000,614 32. 
10, The yearly expenditures of the State for purposes other than those of edu- 
cation, are about $12,500,000. 
12,18. Ihave no means for ascertaining, with certainty, the average monthly 
cost of tuition in the public and private schools of the State. 
18. Hight Normal Schools have been established in this State, six of which 
have been opened. They are designed to impart to teachers, by a judicious course 
of study and training, that professional skill which will enable them to employ 
all methods and practices calculated to awaken interest, incite thought, and de- 
velop power in the scholars placed under their charge. If these schools be held 
strictly to their proper work, I see no reason to doubt that they will afford im- 
portant aid to the cause of Common School education in the State. 
Your obedient servant, 
ABRAM B. WEAVER, 
Sup't Public Instruction. 
STATE OF WISCONSIN, 
Orvice or SUPERINTENDENT oF Pubic Instruction, 
Mapison, August 10, 1869, 
Hon. Joan Eaton, Jr., Sup’t Public Instruction, Nashville, Tennessee: 
Dzar Srr:—I answer your Circular as follows: 
1. A State Superintendent, elected, once in two years, with the other State 
officers. 
2. For duties, see’ Code forwarded, pages 7, 8and 9. He is also ex-officio, a 
member of the Board of Regents vf Normal Schools, and by eustom, Secretary 
and Chief Executive of that Board; he takes order for the holding of the Teach- 
ers’ Institutes, (see Code, pages 183, 184,) and visits and assists in the Institutes. 
Also takes order for issuing “State Teachers’ Certificates” to “teachers of eminent 
qualifications,” after an examination by a suitable Board, appointed by him; also 
countersigns diplomas issued by the State Normal Schools, after their graduates 
have given evidence of good success in teaching. 
8. One assistant, appointed by him, (see Code, page 9,) one clerk, 7. ¢., allowance 
for clerk hire, and a messenger. 
4, To secure intelligent general supervision and unification of public educational 
work; to enable‘the Legislature to act intelligently and understandingly by means 
of the information thus gathered, and suggestions thus made, in developing and 
perfecting an educational system. 
5. County supervision, city supervision, and single district supervision, by the
-P-A-G-E-78
78 
District Board. Town, or township supervision has been provided for, and is be 
ing introduced, to take the place of single district supervision. (See reasons fo 
this change, in Reports of 1867, pages 44-54, and 1868, pages 29-39.) 
6. County and city supervision are necessary, as arms are necessary between th 
head and fingers; a local supervision is necessary, as fingers are necessary, at thi 
ends of thearms, The intermediate supervision is all-important, as tending t: 
elevate and enlighten public educational sentiment, and to improve the school: 
and teachers, Much depends, however, on the Superintendents. The, ~ 7 
selected for fitness, and not on political grounds. The conviction is : 
that they should be appointed, as in Pennsylvania, rather than elected, | ' 
vote. Our City Superintendents are appointed—our County Super : 
are elected. 
7. Including salaries, traveling expenses, clerk and messenger hire, about 
$6,000. ; 
8 County supervision—total, $380.00; average, $690; ranging from $250 to 
$1,200. City supervision—not reported—about the same average. Local distric 
supervision, gratuitous, and about wseless; town supervision, when generally in. 
troduced, will be paid for by a per diem, 
9. Income of. school fund disbursed, $178,128; local taxation and expenditure, 
$1,774,478, (no general or State school tax laid.) These figures do not include the 
expenditure on Normal Schools, $50,000, nor the expenditure for the State Uni- 
versity, $31,000, which would make the grand total expended by the State for 
educational purposes, $2,033,600; but the disbursements for Normal Schools and 
the University, are of the incomes of “funds” arising from the donation | 
State of lands, by the General Government, so that the people of the Stat: 
out of their own pockets, for general or public education, the sum above ment 
$1,774,473. 
10, The general disbursements of the State for other purposes, during the year, 
were $946,519. 
11. Forty-six cents per month (in 1867.) 
12. Not reported, but estimated. at $1.50 to $2.00. 
18. Normal Schools are essential to an efficient system. A system of at least 
six Normal Schools is contemplated; two of which are in successful operation, 
and the buildings for a third are in course of erection. The.third school will be 
opened, it is hoped, in one year; a fourth in five years. Localities compete for 
these schools, donating land or money or buildings for the purpose. Itc- * 
about $12,000 to “run” one of the schools each year, after it is opened ai 
ped. Our Normal Schools are supported by a fund arising from swar 
given to the State. The fund is now $600,000, and will eventually 
$1,000,000. We look upon our Normal School system as the backbo: 
whole system. Very truly yours, 
J. B..PRADT, Assistant Sup’t, 
For A. J. CRAIG, Sup’t Public Tetrratinn 
All who read these valuable. statements must be 
with 
1. The degree of perfection to which the school. wor 
States has been carried; and
-P-A-G-E-79
79 
2. The great struggle, not only to hold what has been gained, but 
to make improvement. 
It is not enough that any system is all that it can be to-day; it 
must grow and strengthen, and perfect itself, with all the opportu- 
nities of to-morrow. 
A little neglect would let a generation of ignorance come forward 
to destroy the pillars of the State, and the peace of society, and to 
befoul with harpy touch the social places of intelligence and virtue. 
Hon. Wm. Bosson, who, more than any other is credited with labors 
for the preparation and passage of the present school laws in Ten- 
nessee, and who has been the untiring supporter of its administra- 
tion, has, on solicitation, furnished an interesting statement of its 
origin and passage, presented in Appendix [A.] It shows how 
carefully these excellencies of other school systems were consulted 
in its preparation. It did not grow up in anight. Tt was no par- 
tisan trick. It was grounded on the opinions of the fathers of the 
country, and sought to gather into the system, for the sons and 
daughters of Tennessee, all the accumulated excellencies of two 
centuries of experience. This report early calls attention to the 
contrast between the old law and the new. Having noticed its inaug- 
uration, and having also taken a glance at some of the general 
principles of education on which it is based, and their successful 
developments elsewhere, we are better prepared to look at it es- 
pecially prominent features in the briefest space. All expect some 
law on the subject of public schools. Friends and foes of the edu- 
cation of the people agree in this—foes would have an inoperative 
system; friends, the most efficient. 
The popularity of a school system in some form, is too great even 
for its foes to oppose it openly. They must admit a system, but 
destroy its vitality, the force by which it accomplishes its benign 
results. Education is an admitted necessity; school-houses and 
teachers are admitted necessities. The qualification of teachers is 
a subject not to be ignored. It is possible to have all these, and no 
living power for the education of all classes prevailing over all op- 
position, Indeed, education for them may pass into desuetude. 
It may pass on so comfortably that a large, ignorant class may 
come up in the State, one fourth or one-third, or one half of the 
population, or, as in South Carolina, more than one-half, unable to 
read. The profits of industry, the capital of the poor, may be re-
-P-A-G-E-80
80 
duced accordingly. But start the improvements which will bring 
all under the benign influence of education, which gives the system 
means and fitness to accomplish its own ends, and its enemies 
are aroused. They cannot be easy. 
These essentials to its success they pronounce wrong; they must 
return to the old system; they see lions in the way; it is too com- 
plicated, too expensive. They have the same opposition to offer 
the features which assure its success, that thieves, robbers and 
other breakers of the laws have to a system of laws that have no 
room for the escape of crime, and enforces its full and just punish- 
ment. They object to Legislatures and Courts, to Governors and 
Sheriffs. These, they plead, cost too much; they constitute a gov- 
ernment too complicated. Give them the simplicity of the nomadic 
relations. Let everybody do as he pleases. 
This is the logic of opposition to a system of free education. Car- 
ried to its final conclusions, it would destroy all governments, and 
reduce society to the chaos of barbarism, The educational senti- 
ment therefore becomes a measure of the probabilities of the suc- 
cess of a vigorous system of schools. Especially is this true in a 
popular government, where the formation and enforcement of law 
depend upon the action of the people. 
The excellent educational systems, and vast results we have con- 
templated elsewhere, were impossible without an appreciating senti- 
ment on the part of the citizens, which sustained them, and sccured 
their benefits to their children. 
No vigorous system, not even when taking to itself the compulsory 
feature, has failed in a republic or monarchy, to receive the strong- 
est support. : 
No taxes, asa rule, are paid so willingly, as those for the edu- 
cation of the young 
Upon this point I introduce the following pertinent valuable tes- 
timony: 
Mr. Kay, late Traveling Bachelor of the University of Cam- 
bridge, in his work on “The Social Condition and Education of the 
People of England and Hurope,” vol. IL, pp. 27-29, states as fol- 
lows on this subject: “I went to Prussia, with the firm expectation 
that I should hear nothing but complaints from the peasants, and 
that I should find the school nothing but a worthy offshoot of an 
absolute government. ‘To test whether this really was the case or
-P-A-G-E-81
81 
not, as well as to see something of the actual working of the sys- 
tem in the country districts, I traveled alone through different parts 
of the Rhine Provinces for four weeks, before proceeding to the 
capital. During the whole of my solitary rambles, I put myself as 
much as possible into communication with the peasants, and with the 
teachers, for the purpose of testing the actual state of feeling on 
this question. Judge, then, of my surprise when I assure my 
readers that although I conversed with many of the very poorest of 
the people, and with both Romanists and Protestants, and although 
I always endeavored to elicit expressions of discontent, I never once 
heard, in any part of Prussia, one word spoken by any of the 
peasants against the educational regulations. But, on the contrary, 
Teverywhere received daily and hourly proofs, of the most une- 
quivocal character, of the satisfaction and pride with which a Prus- 
sian, however poor he may be, looks upon the schools of his locality. 
Often and often have I been answered by the poor laborers, when 
asking them whether they did not dislike being obliged to educate 
their children: ‘Why should I? The schools are excellent; the 
teachers are very good and learned men; and then, think how much 
good our children are gaining—they behave better at home; they 
make our families all the happier, and they are much better able in 
life to earn their own livelihood. No, no! we do not dislike the 
schools. We know too well how much good our children are gain- 
ing from them.’ And one very poor man of Cologne added: ‘You 
see, if we are not rich enough to pay the school fees, or to give our 
children clothes decent enough for the school-room, the town does 
this for us. So, really, we have not the least reason to complain.’ 
Lhave heard this said, over and over again, in different parts of 
Prussia, Saxony, Bavaria, Wirtemburg and Baden; and, indeed, I 
may add that throughout Germany I never heard one single word 
of discontent uttered against these truly liberal and Christian estab- 
lishments. Every one of the richer classes with whom I con- 
versed corroborated the truth of all that the peasants had told me. 
I particularly remember a very intelligent teacher, at Elberfeld, 
saying to me: ‘Iam quite convinced that if we had a political 
revolution to-morrow, none of the peasants would think of wishing 
to have any great alteration made in the laws which relate to the 
schools.’ Recent facts have proved the truth of the assertion.”

EDUCATIONAL SENTIMENT. 
Educational sentiment must precede and direct educational activ- 
ity. But these school efforts began in a period when public senti- 
ment had been torn with hostile demonstrations. Vacant places in 
the family, and little mounds marking the struggle and march of 
armies, concentrated sentiment. The first-born, now dead, absorbed 
more thought and feeling than the needs of the living youth. He 
who came to divert thought, and restore it to its usual devotion to 
those soon to enter upon the stage of active life, was neither sure of 
a welcome from child or parent. Those in most need of the healing 
which his offices might bring were in danger of seeking to fight the 
battle of the dead past over with him again. The conception of a 
pure educational sentiment, disinterested and devoted to the public 
good, seemed wanting. Too few entertained it, and those who did 
not have it in their own breasts could not accredit it to others. Its 
clear crystallization seemed to demand a settling of the muddy 
waters of feeling and thought. But these, in their agitation, refused 
to admit at once certain results of the period of war as conclusive. 
They must be reargued and refought. From what centers could 
these influences of crystallization go out? The pulpit? That felt 
itself literally girded with the armor of the Church militant. From 
the press? That found itself little sought, if it indulged in any- 
thing so peaceful and free from the smell of powder as education. 
From the politicalcaucus? Who gave that any credit for a position 
if it was not arrayed on the line where the armies last fought? 
From statesmen? Alas! the smoke of carnage left them few and 
far between, and little disposed to treat surrounding ills by a 
remedy so indirect and slow as the training of the young, however 
sure of the results. Yet, amid all the occupation of sentiment 
otherwise, and its collisions, there were hearts anxious and studious 
for the young. However undefined or unadmitted as a distinct 
educational sentiment, it mingled in the fears and hopes of thought- 
ful fathers and mothers and citizens, and of not a few of the young. 
Schools under private control were reviving just then, in spite of 
all embarrassments. Colleges and professional classes were re- 
forming. And those who were not participating directly or by 
their friends in educational activities felt a demand for something 
not possessed—something more than the past afforded. Some 
agency must be found to help thought and feeling to rise into other
-P-A-G-E-83
83 
regions of intelligence and virtue than those in which they were 
left by the period of hostilities. Brougham must send the schaol- 
master abroad in place of the soldier. Out of the State, out of a 
county or district, can a sufficient number be long enough agreed 
to do this? The revised law left no option for its officers. But the 
strong and well-marked intelligent sentiment in its support, and 
the agencies for its dissemination, as seen from this office, gave two 
large reasons for hesitancy. No educational periodical was pub- 
lished in the State, nor had any a considerable circulation in it. 
Treatises upon the subject of education were rare. There were 
no educational libraries. No one made pedagogy his subject of 
study or writing. Comparatively few had even a passing ac- 
; quaintance with the facts in educational systems in this country or 
in Europe. 
The information was not in possesion of the public mind, upon 
which an educational sentiment must depend. Tere and there the 
most crude and incorrect notions of education, in its various func- 
tions, departments, objects and methods, were expressed. For a 
quarter of a century the elder Dr. Lindsley had charged his elo- 
quence with the delivery’ to the intelligent minds of the State of a 
knowledge of the duties and responsibilities of education. Doak 
and Anderson, and their compeers in the work, had guided the edu- 
cational forces around them, with the hope of permanent and wide 
results. Great and good men had come from this training, but they 
had passed away; their voices were silent in the grave. The cars 
that listened to them had ceased to hear. No libraries, filled. with 
their thoughts, were read in every neighborhood. No schools, free. 
to all, furnished a universal medium for communication of their 
principles among the people, and perpetuated them from generation 
to generation. Virginia, in other days, held ideas remarkably like 
Massachusetts. How did they, par nobdile fratrum, walk avm-in-arm 
in the struggle for independence! But Virginia, another day, with 
the family, the private school, seminary and the church, all great but 
limited agencies for diffusing and perpetuating those principles, finds 
herself by degrees limiting them, disavowing them, and, as appears 
in the treatment of Mr. Jefferson’s plans for education, adopting 
others diverse or hostile, till she is prostrate in the dust. While 
Massachusetts, in addition to all the limited agencies which re- 
stricted these same principles of human action to the individual, the 
family or the church, had the free common school, which, by sup-
-P-A-G-E-84
84 
plying universal intelligence, guaranteed a medium of diffusion and 
perpetuity limited only by the number of the minds in the Com- 
monwealth. The life of Dr. Lindsley, the educator of hundreds of 
young men, with rare power of impressing himself upon his students 
—the life even of this man, so widely claimed as a friend, prepared 
with care, published with his choicest efforts, in excellent style, had, 
as Lam authoritatively informed, found hardly more than half a 
dozen purchasers in the State. Orators, statesmen, jurists and 
teachers, great and renowned, had come and gone, but their lives 
had been rarely written and lessread. Their living contributions to 
the educational sentiment had, with themselves, become too much of 
the past. The State and county never, and a city seldom, had 
published a report on schools or education. 
The power of organization, too, had been little tried for the dis- 
semination of just sentiments in support of labors for the promotion 
of universal culture. The very structure of society had limited 
what was attempted, to a condition of liberty and of race, and de- 
clared the principles of universal education impossible. This lim- 
itation of the fundamental principle imperiled all results, even for 
the few it would gladly benefit. Ignorance was given an advantage. 
Learning found other classes than slaves difficult of access. Labor 
and poverty went too easily aside into the darkness assigned only 
bondmen, The idea found encouragement for the separation of 
schools into those for the rich and those for the poor, with a tend- 
ency to arousing all the hostilities and animosities of wealth and 
pauperism. Educational sentiment, therefore, in the fall of 1867, 
however deep and solicitous, was undefined ; found few methods of 
public expression; had little trust in any plan offered; was not 
able to cast out its own antagonisms; was injured by defective 
notions of the past, and was without books, periodicals and other 
instrumentalities needed for its dissemination and correction. The 
revised law was first offered as a text for study and information. Its 
execution should be better than educational lectures. The free and 
full publication of facts, as developed, should supply at once 
philosophy of universal education and the arguments for its amplifi- 
cation and illustration. But confidence, the first and most needed 
thing, was not possible, in the troubled state of the public mind. 
Misstatements, false reprepresentations and accusations against 
its purposes and the character of its officers found ample room for 
publication and credence. If the system gave no special signs of
-P-A-G-E-85
85 
life it was passed by in silence. This suggested that a proper system 
of schools on paper, and the levy of the school tax and its uncon- 
stitutional use for other purposes, were admissible; butif its officers 
pressed it into execution according to the spirit and terms of the law, 
no matter how competent, faithful, honest, self-sacrificing or wise 
they might be in doing just what the State needed, there seemed to 
be no accusations too base, and no language too violent for use against 
them. The phenomena presented might long furnish studies for 
amusement, did not the effects upon the young, creating distrust, 
closing schools, sending the children again abroad in ignorance, and 
in thousands of instances depriving them of their only opportunity 
for a knowledge of letters, afford a counterpart most sad to contem- 
plate, 
The State Association of Teachers was organized in July, 
1865, or two years before this office was opened, and had had annual 
meetings, able addresses and discussions, and had done much in the 
right direction and manner to arouse public attention and fix it upon 
this great necessity. They had taken a stand, first, in favor of free 
schools ; secondly, in favor of guarding and honoring the profession 
of teaching, and thirdly, in behalf of Normal Schools. They had 
“set forth the importance of preparing the freed people for the ex- 
ercise of their rights and the performance of their duties as citizens, 
and commending the work of their education. A resolution was 
also passed advising the formation of auxiliary district and County 
Teachers’ Associations.’’ They urged the Legislature to a liberal 
provision for education and pressed the doctrine that the property 
of the State should educate the children of the State. Many of the 
most prominent friends of learning and virtue in the State appear 
in the earliest records of the association. 
These several meetings have been the occasion of great interest. 
Their discussions, addresses and proceedings, have done much to 
spread abroad correct information in regard to education as a 
means of forming the sentiment necessary to save the children from 
the effects of ignorance and its vices and crimes. Through the in- 
defatigable and well directed efforts of Colonel M. C. Wilcox, Sec- 
retary of the Association, its proceedings and some of the addresses 
have been published for circulation. An effort was made by the 
Association to secure the benefit of a school magazine in the State 
among the teachers and friends of education. An arrangement was
-P-A-G-E-86
86 
made with the Ohio Educational Monthly, Hon E. E. White, ed- 
itor and proprietor, to publish a Tennessee edition, with four pages 
of matter furnished by the State, on condition that four hundred 
subscribers were secured in the State. 
The matter for the Tennessee department was furnished several 
months, but the subscribers did not reach much above one-fourth of 
the number required, and it has not been deemed just to the pub- 
lisher to put him to the expense of furnishing a Tennessee edition. 
The counties of Hamilton, Shelby, Davidson and Jefferson, were 
especially wise in putting a copy of an educational journal in the 
hands of the Clerk of each District School Board. 
This is a most cheap method of improving schools and_benefit- 
ting the young. It is a serious commentary upon the condition of 
educational thought, that a system of schools though just starting, 
yet having in its employ three thousand teachers, and conducted by 
eighty County Superintendents and five thousand Directors, should 
not be able to carry the subscription to a valuable educational 
monthly beyond one hundred and fifty. But this difficulty is always 
encountered in the struggle with vice andignorance. The State that 
enters the conflict must shape its agencies accordingly, in order 
to succeed. Different States freely aid the publication of journals 
for the benefit of schools. Some bestow fifteen hundred dollars 
annually on this object. It is to be hoped that ere long Tennessee 
will have a journal of its own, aided, as far as needful, by the State. 
The special lack of a knowledge of what others are doing—of the 
improvements made in the different systems of what our best men 
have thought and said—has induced me to give more full quotations 
in this report than would otherwise have been necessary. Atten- 
tion is specially invited to Appendix, [-A.] 
How deeply our eminent educators feel the necessity of a free 
and general diffusion of educational information, is well indicated 
by the letter from the Rev. B. W. McDonold, D. D., President of 
Cumberland University. Received too late for action before my 
retirement from these duties, yet I may express the hope some ad- 
equate steps will be taken in this direction at an early day. 
Lusanon, Tewn., Sepiember 16, 1869. 
Gey. J. Eaton, 
Srx;—I make the following proposition to the Educational Bureau: 
I will prepare an elaborate series of articles on the common school interests, and 
educational interests of the common people, if the Department or Bureau, will se- 
cure me the loan of such books as I shall need for the investigation,
-P-A-G-E-87
87 
Leare not where or how they get them; and they shall all be returned to the 
office at Nashville, when I complete the service. . 
I shail need all of Barnard’s works, Quarterly, etc., together with various other, 
books, German, French and English; I should say, five hundred dollars worth of 
books, 
Sincerely, yours, 
B. W. McDONOLD, 
Some States, for this purpose, send agents abroad to observe and 
report what is done in other States and counties, in educational in- 
terests, Ohiosent Dr. C. E. Stowe; Massachusetts, Hon. Horace 
Mann; their reports have been republished by other States. The 
eminent Dr. Ryerson, Chief Superintendent of Education for the 
Province of Ontario, published a special report, full of varied infor- 
mation, collected with care, in regard to European and American 
systems. 
A somewhat similar summary was furnished the Legislature of 
New York by Hon. V. M. Rice, so long the distinguished Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction. 
The peculiar circumstances in which popular education among us 
must be revived, renders some special effort peculiarly necessary. 
The educational ideas of the past had naturally conformed to the 
existing conditions of society. The enslavement of one entire class 
in the community, having been exchanged for their freedom, re- 
quired corresponding modifications of the training with which each 
should be furnished. Having proceeded upon the theory that labor 
should be absolutely under cuntrol, and needed no intelligence; nay 
that culture, that knowledge of letters on the part of the slave, was 
especially perilous to the system, that the only need of culture was 
on the part of the master, and this he was amply able to secure for 
himself, the intermediate class of persons—those who did not own 
slaves, and who were not owned as slaves—oceupied a most unfortu- 
nate position. The richer classes had not the property interest in 
them, and did not consider them part of the same classification, be- 
cause they were not slave owners. These general ideas, modified 
by local influences, shaped education accordingly, While, as I 
have intimated, the popularity of a State school system demanded 
its enactment, the wealthy expected no advantage to their children 
from it, for they sent them to pay schools. These facts left the 
public school soon in bad odor as pauper schools. 
Governor Hammond, of South Carolina, in 1843, pronounced the 
system “a failure,” and affirmed that it was so regarded by the pau-
-P-A-G-E-88
88 
pers, for whose children it was intended; and adds, that “their pride 
revolts at the idea of sending their children to school as poor 
children.” This condition of schools in the State could but give 
prevalence to a perverted educational sentiment. 
None but a perverted system could suit it. It confounded good 
men. They felt the appalling necessity that was upon the State for 
education, yet could not see any easy solution. There was no un- 
tying the knot; it must be cut; schools of nearly all characters, 
and almost universally, were suspended early after the war broke 
out. The whole public thought was occupied with war. War was 
the subject of speeches, of sermons, of newspaper articles, of 
cross-reads’ and friend’s conversation. Boys and girls had grown 
to manhood with no school training, yet under the influence of the 
excitement of the period. One of the first acts of the reorganized 
State should have been the opening of schools. But it is said the 
State was poor. Yes, it was poor; yet, no State or man is so poor 
that he can afford to neglect the child. 
The man devoid of natural affection is pronounced worse than 
an infidel; the State that is inhuman in not providing for its chil- 
dren cannot be less reprehensible. Suppose, for a moment, the 
State had opened a system of schools in the summer of 1865. 
Some one says there was no money. There was money for other 
purposes, and there could as well have been money for schools. 
Had the schools been opened, a large number of youth, who con- 
sidered themselves too old in 1868, when we succeeded in starting 
schools, would have attended. Many would haye learned to read 
and write, who now will never learn. Some would have been in 
school one year, others two, others three. Who can calculate what 
effect such efforts made throughout the State would have had? 
Parents, children and citizens, would have had some other subject of 
thought and conversation, besides the dead, but bitter, topics of the 
war. Children would have improved, and parents and friends 
would join with them in their gladness. Intelligence and virtue 
would have been on the increase. Industry would have multiplied 
its skill and products. But,as it has been, how many of these same 
youth have been the criminals that have gorged our jails and peni- 
tentiary, broken the hearts of mothers and fathers, or, in their 
rashness or madness, formed the parties who have openly, or under 
cover of night or of disguises, whipped people, broken open houses, 
burned school-houses, and disturbed the peace of communities here
-P-A-G-E-89
89 
and there, until men of all classes have come to unite their voices as 
one man, in condemnation? ‘ : 
Thus, all have been compelled to suffer the consequences of de- 
ranged industry, reduced incomes, delayed immigration, and the 
reluctance of capital to accept investment, and the additional evils 
of continuing, in a measure, the military conditions of the war, and 
meeting its added expense by taxation. Can there be any doubt 
that the policy of opening schools would have been better and 
cheaper than the one pursued? Nay, the State had better have 
enforced education. M. Cousin, the French Minister of Public In- 
struction, in one of his able papers, remarks: “A century since, 
the country of Baden was one of the least improved countries. At 
the close of the wars of the Republic and the Empire, it came forth 
from its lethargy. Compulsory instruction, decreed in principle in 
1803, received in 1834 the most important developments, and one 
generation suffices to make the Grand Duchy one of the most pros- 
perous States of Germany.” What have been the consequences? 
He adds: “The morality and riches of the country have increased, 
and the prisons become empty.” 
Doctor Dietz, the Educational Commissioner, referring to this 
transformation, declares the principal instrument of this develop- 
ment has certainly been the compulsory education of the popular 
classes. M. Baudouin, the French School Commissioner to Ger- 
many and Switzerland, in his Report to the Emperor, says: 
**Germany, which was the first to enter upon the career of school reform, and 
which had first transformed into public and free schools the numerous convents 
with which its territory was covered, received, long since, the fruits of an initiative 
as happy as it is bold. In the sciences, in literature and arts, it soon occupied an 
eminent rank among the most advanced nations. Agriculture, the working of 
mines, industry and commerce, sprang into life; and at this day it is impossible to 
study attentively tue activity and riches of its great industrial centers, Leipsic, 
Hamburg, Elberfeld, Bremen, Crefeld, ete., without being siruck with the connec- 
tion which exists in a country between the spread of instruction and the develop- 
ment of public prosperity. Until these better times Southern Germany, (Austria, 
Bavaria, ete ,) left the control of instruction in unskillful hands, or to those accus- 
tomed to restrict it, in order to prevent it from going out of the ruts of the old 
track; thus, notwithstanding the richness of its mines, the excellence of its pas- 
tures, the fertility of its soil, the general state of its affairs is not comparable to 
that of the provinces of the North. Switzerland renders these deductions almost 
palpable, because the terms of the comparison are nearer each other. In the 
Cantons of Bale, Zurich, Berne, Neufchatel, etc., public instruction is obligatory. 
The authorities are watchful to sec that the school laws are strictly observed; the 
pastors encourage and stimulate the masters; the Grand Councils interest them- 
selves in the progress of the schools, and excite emulation, In the Cantons of Lu-
-P-A-G-E-90
90 
cerne, Soleure, ete., the Commissions of Overseers remain indifferent. The Grand 
Councils, composed of ignorant farmers, think that the state of schools is perfect, 
in remaining what it was in their time. Thus, when one travels in Switzerland, 
not to admire the beauty of the landscapes, but to examine thoroughly into its in- 
stitutions, and to seek counsel in results, he has no need of looking at the territorial 
limits to perceive that he is passing from 1 Canton in which instruction has been 
neglected into another in which it has been carefully cultivated.” 
Let us conclude, then, without fear of deceiving ourselves, that 
the prosperity of a country marches parallel with public instruc- 
tion—advances, retrogrades or remains stationary with it, and that 
there is always between the two parts, an incontestible connection, 
which bears the authentic character of cause and effect. 
But Tennessee not only did not adopt the enforcement of educa- 
tion; the State did nothing but collect a school tax. As we have 
seen, the provisions of the Code were a dead letter, and those of the 
new law almost equally so, from its passage in March, 1867, until 
the opening of this office in the following October. 
Education of the Colored People.—The special change in 
educational ideas and practice in the State, required by the freedom 
of those who were formerly slaves, was the one hard point to pass. 
No matter what system or what set of men attempted it, the old 
prejudices were not ready to witness its progress in quiet. The 
general judgment that it must be done; that it was better it should 
be done, for the whites as well as blacks; that, so they would be 
more a law to themselves, their industry would be more skillful 
and productive; that they would be more productive of wealth 
and of virtue than if left in the ignorance of slavery, did not suffice. 
All reasoning, however it attempts other conclusions, comes towards 
these by some approach. No bitterness of feeling, no strength of 
prejudice, can avoid it. 
All invention is employed to give perfection to machinery, so 
that it may approach more nearly to the skill of man. Could the 
industry of the ox be given human skill, how schools for oxen 
would multiply! The conclusions by parity of reasoning, in favor 
of educating the colored laborer, are so manifest that common sense 
accepts them before they are stated. Human nature must come 
under the laws of that nature. No man, on account of his place 
of birth or the color of his skin, can claim to be an exception. 
All men are not geniuses, but all have some degree of ability, 
which is susceptible of improvement. No one need be a dunce. 
The Spartan—one of that people renowned for courage—we dre
-P-A-G-E-91
91 
tald, said his sword was too short, when he was answered: “'Too 
short? Why, then, add a step to it.” If his sword was not long 
enough to reach his object, then he could step nearer his object. If 
any man’s talent did not enable him to reach the object of his life 
without effort, and no man’s talent does, then he must secure that 
object by effort. 
Education gives him the training and the information by which 
to direct that effort, and make it successful. The school gives the 
key to knowledge. Knowledge is power, but it is not all in books. 
Michael Angelo, when eighty years of age, walking in the Coliseum 
by moonlight, was asked why he was there, and replied: “I go to 
school that I may learn.” Knowledge is on the streets, in the 
shops, wherever man wanders or labors. The mind of a man once 
aroused and trained to thinking— 
“The field’s his study—nature is his bok.” 
As physical labor or exercise makes man strong and active, so the 
intellectual training necessary for the acquisition of knowledge 
makes him mentally “broad-shouldered, symmetrical, swift.” 
The State is but the aggregation of individuals. The more ex- 
cellent and complete the individual, and the more of them there are 
in the State—no matter what their color—the stronger and better 
the State. Colored education is alike the work of the philanthrop- 
ist, the statesman and the Christian. A noted murderer, when 
about to be hung, said he was the “creature of circumstances.” 
These, so far as in the control of man, should, therefore, be made 
destructive to vice, and favorable to virtue. This is the legitimate 
function of universal education. : 
A Word of History.—These difficulties in the direction of col- 
ored education did not exist altogether because there were no exam- 
ples of its success. 
Various towns in the State had for several years had successful 
colored schools. 
I find in a statement by Rev. L. H. Cobb, that “in the early au- 
tumn of 1862, Miss Lucinda Humphrey, (afterward Mrs. Capt. Hay,) 
who was a hospital nurse, opened an evening school for the colored 
employes of the hospital at Memphis.’’ Others followed, increas- 
ing from year to year, until in the winter of 1864°5 a method was 
provided for the colored people to enter actively into the work of 
supporting their own schools, and after which, in about five months»
-P-A-G-E-92
92 
they paid for the purpose, some four thousand dollars, and the at- 
tendance was reported in and around Memphis, as high as 1,949, in 
April, 1865, before the organization of the Freedmen’s Bureau. 
In Clarksville, schools were established for them in 1864, and by 
the spring of 1865 had realized an attendance of some 800. Dur- 
ing the same period, Rev. J. G. MeKee and his associates opened 
similarly flourishing schools in Nashville, Mr. Mitchell in Murfrees- 
boro, and othersin Chattanooga, Knoxville, etc. Indeed, before 
the Bureau R. F. & A. L., was organized in the spring of 1865, it 
is believed over four thousand colored children were under instruc- 
tion in the State. They showed special avidity in the acquisition 
of the rudiments of education. Under the Bureau, the schools’ at- 
“tendance well nigh doubled. The Superintendent of Montgomery 
county, speaking of these efforts, observes, ‘““The good order that pre- 
vailed, the peaceable character of the laborers, and the manifestly 
useful tendency of their efforts, tended powerfully to prepare the 
way for the public school system by demolishing old prejudices and 
pointing outa better way. But the struggle is not one to be closed 
in amoment.”” 
It has furnished a rare test of men. Public profession was not 
always found indicative of the course of action. Moral heroes and 
moral cowards have been found on every side of political and sectarian 
questions. ‘The struggle for colored education in Marshall county 
was severe, and at times seemed likely to go against colored schools, 
until Col. W. B. [folden, who fought in the war against the Federal 
Governwent, with a good sense and manliness that our common hu- 
manity delights to honor, became the teacher of the colored school 
in the principal town in the county. Here and there throughout 
the State, the nobler and truer sentiments have found some worthy 
representatives, and universal education has progressed as no one 
expected. Nothing could give me greater satisfaction than to record 
its complete triumph and leave all that is unpleasant of the past to 
forgetfulness and oblivion. 
Old prejudices are not all dead. In places, colored teachers have 
’ deen recently whipped, school houses burned and schools closed. 
Men of Tennessee, of humane and Christian sentiments, have not 
closed their labors for colored education. The struggle still con- 
tinues and they cannot be spared. Itis not enough to say that 
violence is committed only by the drunken and abandoned. If the 
colored citizen owes unqualified fealty to the government, the State
-P-A-G-E-93
98 
owes him absolute protection to his life and property, and security 
to his liberty and pursuit of happiness. 
Citizens who enforce law in other respects, must in this. The ad- 
mission of lawlessness towards any class in the community estab- 
lishes the fact of the disregard of law, opens the gate, and no mat- 
ter how strong the entire enclosure beside, there is ample room for 
the commission of crime and the escape of the criminals; and thus, 
by degrees, all life and all property are imperilled. 
A man that can harm the State, its citizen, or his property, the 
State is bound to restrain. His color should not change or prevent 
his punishment. 
Those who oppose the education of the colored children do not 
oppose the punishment of colored criminals. But as we have seen 
at various stand-points in the progrees of this report, the neglect 
of education in any class, turns them over to the temptation of vice 
and crime. 
Closing the school houses against the colored children, decrees 
for them the jail and prison. Refuse to build school houses for 
them, and we must build jails and prisons, Refuse to meet the ex- 
pense of their education, and we must meet the greater expense of 
their crimes, while we have all property and life exposed. Besides 
the additional fact of their enfranchisement now makes them part 
and parcel of the power which chooses the officers and makes the 
laws for the whole people. 
Certainly, citizens of a republic can not be less wise than those 
of a monarchy, under similar circumstances. Recently, when there 
had been an extension of the suffrage*in England to the lower 
classes, the Queen, in opening Parliament, made the education of 
the people the subject of special reference, and Earl Russell came 
forward with the following resolutions in the House of Lords: 
Resolved, That in the opinion of this House, the education of the working 
classes in England and Wales, ought to be extended and improved; every child has 
a right to the blessings of education, and it is the duty of the State to guard and 
maintain that right, In the opinion of this House, the diffusion of knowledge 
ought not to be hindered by religious differences, nor should the early employ- 
ment of the young in labor be allowed to deprive them of education. 
2. That it is the opinion of this House that Parliament and government should 
aid in the education of the middle classes by providing for the better administra- 
tion of charitable endowments. 
3. That it is the opinion of this House that the Universities of Oxford and Cam- 
bridge may be made more useful to the nation by the removal of restrictions, and 
by the appointment of a commission to consider the better distribution of the 
large revenues for instruction in connection with said Universities,
-P-A-G-E-94

4, That the appointment of a Minister of Education by the Crown, with a seat 
im the Cabinet, would, in the opinion of this House, be conducive to the public 
benefit. 
Taxation for Colored Schools has, notwithstanding, been a pe- 
culiarly obnoxious feature of the law. I will not attempt to repeat 
what has been said. There were feelings which could not endure 
great taxation. If the colored man could steal an education, or 
pay for it himself, and nothing be said to them about it, they might 
suffer it; but to tax them for the support of colored schools, was too 
much. Yetthe support of schools by tax is fundamental and es- 
sential to success. 
The form of this tax corresponds, as provided in the revised law, 
to the successful systems in Europe and America. ‘Two forms of 
tax—one State, the other district—were provided to meet the ex- 
pense of public education. The law set a standard below which it 
was not deemed safe, for its own interests, to go. It required a 
school of five months each year, and made the teaching of each 
school in each district the condition of State aid. It provided for 
the raising of the State fund for annual disbursement, by the levy 
of a State tax, and enacted that the district, by vote of the people, 
should raise the balance by assessing a tax upon themselves. 
Tn neither case could a just and equal expenditure for colored 
children be avoided without utter destruction of the principles of 
universal education. 
Special Additional Reason for Immediate Universal Edu- 
eation.—But ere we have settled this vast interest, we stand at the 
threshold of another—the education of the incoming multitudes 
from China. They have been taught at home. The ideas of their 
paganism and of their morality are deeply rooted. They are an old 
nation, and have long possessed many of the greatest improvements 
of which the Caucasian boasts the discovery. Our statesmen are 
anxious with the forebodings already upon them, of the issues pre- 
sented. Our poets already sing to them the song of the American 
spirit: 
“Brothers, whom we may not reach 
Through the vail of alien speech, 
Weleome! welcome! eyes can teil 
What the lips in vain would spel]— 
Words that hearts can understand, 
Brothers feim the Flowery Land!

  The vast population of China has been long swarming out over 
her seas, along the coast of Java and other portions of Asia. In 
America they meet ideas and opportunities and attractions nowhere 
else found. Already a line of steamers is established between our 
Western coast and their seaports. The Pacific Railroad brings 
them within a few weeks of our productive valleys, and soil and 
climate, our great resources and our imperfect industry. The Amer- 
can mail delivers as many letters in China asin Italy. Their num- 
bers are hundreds of millions to our tens of millions. They could 
send us a larger population than now inhabits the United States,
-P-A-G-E-96
96 
and benefit, rather than discommode, those left at home. How soon 
Tennessee must bear its share in these questions, none can tell. 
We cannot be too well prepared. Already it has been found that 
the American school is the only instrumentality successful in as- 
similating them to our civilization. 
The Competition into which Tennessee must Enter.—No 
future or present interests allow us to neglect the education of a 
single human being in our midst. Every State now controlled by 
its own organization is at work. Able and active educators, and 
public-spirited citizens and statesmen, are pressing forward im- 
provements. Kentucky has voted to increase the tax for school 
purposes. Tennessee cannot do as laggards suggest, nor as she 
might if no other State existed around her. She must win or lose, 
in the competition of free schools, Here is the spirit expressed by 
Mr. Smith, which is taking possession of Kentucky: 
“Already, many of our sturdy and industrious yeomanry, feeling that their 
children were doomed to ignorance and obscurity in Kentucky, while open and 
free education offered the rewards of intelligence, enterprise and progress to them 
in other States, have turned their backs upon their old homes, and emigrated 
among the strangers of a distant land; and we will plead in vain for foreign sup- 
plies of labor to till our neglected farms, while the agents of other States are able 
to hold out the tempting bonus of one hundred dollars’ worth of education per an- 
num, against our meagerness and destitution. A man’s children are his hope, his 
pride, his all! For them he lives, labors and sacrifices, Open to the poor man the 
prospect of the advancement, culture and elevation of his children, and he will 
hazard all else for the attainment of these, Popular education would seem to bea 
necessity to a republican government, The people are the depository of sovereign 
power, and create its institutions by the exercise of their suffrage. If the charac- 
ter cf the government depends on the wisdom with which the suffrage privilege is 
used, it is of paramount importance to the security of our lives, liberties and prop- 
erties, that the people should be enlightened and intelligent as sovereign electors; 
and to this end the government should provide ample means, 
‘Nor is the argument of economy and utility exhausted. Skilled and educated 
labor rapidly enhances in productive value over that of crude ignorance; and it 
may be safely estimated that every educated laborer increases his industrial ca- 
pacity two-fold, and thus becomes doubly valuable to the body politic. If educa- 
tion of the masses promotes and fosters general intelligence, enterprise, skilled labor 
and prosperous independence, and abates crime and pauperism, as is ably and con- 
clusively argued from the grounds of reason and experience, its advantages to the 
mere material wealth of a government are incaleulable. Patronized with a liberal 
confidence, as the energizing agent of modern civilization, its magic power awakens 
intellectual activity, inventive genius, speculative enterprise, physical science and 
art, and experimental and practical industry, out of which are born our railroads, 
telegraphs, navigation, commerce, manufactures, and other institutions and ele- 
ments of material growth and greatness, so essential to social and civil development,
-P-A-G-E-97
97 
as well as material prosperity. The path of interest, honor and duty, lies before 
us, evident and well defined; and in such an era of progress and reform, of en- 
lightenment and refined sentiment, the character and reputation of our beloved 
and grand old Commonwealth cannot afford to lie under the paralysis of stagnation 
longer, whilst the living policy of progress is in force on every hand around. 
“To those nations which have wooed and won her smiles, education has brought 
the heritage of glory, renown, power, wealth, enterprise, enlightenment, culture, 
refinement, and all that contributes to the enriching, ennobling and elevating of 
humanity, To these which have slighted its patronage and caresses, there hag 
come the heritage of degradation, obscurity, weakness, poverty, stagnation, ig- 
norance, and all that brutalizes human nature and reduces man to barbarism, 
The United States, England, France, Prussia and Germany, are examples of the 
favoritism of this queenly benefactress, whilst the fates of Mexico, Spain, Turkey 
and Egypt, illustrate the evils which have befallen those whom the inspiration of 
her love has never touched,” 
Local Taxation for Schools.—However great the reluctance 
to increase the present burden of taxation, and notwithstanding the 
outbursts of wrath were so violent against the free school system 
while being put in operation, yet its objects were so manifestly 
right and in the interest of all right-minded persons, and County 
Superintendents succeeded so well in showing the necessity of pro- 
viding school-houses and supplementing the fund distributed by the 
State, that numerous districts proceeded, in accordance with the 
law, to levy the small tax necessary. In some instances it was col- 
lected in full; in others it was in process of collection; in most, just 
levied, or about to be levied, when the Supreme Court, by the de- 
cision of two of its members-—-Mr. Justice Shackelford and Mr. 
Justice Smith—affirmed that such levy by districts, though by vote 
of the people, was unconstitutional—Mr. Justice Andrews dissent- 
ing. According to tle best information at my command, the erec- 
tion of not less than five hundred district school-houses was pre- 
vented. The right arm of the system was stricken off. To many: 
friends of education the blow seemed fatal, as it struck at a principle 
which had been so essential to all successful State organization. 
Two forms of action, involving something of this principle, re- 
mained : 
1. The right of counties to levy a tax for school purposes. 
2. The right of incorporated towns to levy a tax for this purpose. 
Attention was called to this at once as a source of relief. Few 
places availed themselves of it. The county is too large to feel 
the proper sympathy with the school, to do all for it as required, 
The school stands next to the family. It is an affair of neighbor-

hoods. Family interests and neighborhood interests sustain its 
they emulate each other in efforts to have the best house, best 
teachers and best school, inspired and guided by a supervisory in- 
fluence which brings them into an acquaintance with all other lo- 
calities, and holds them to a faithful discharge of their duties. The 
Board of County Commissioners for Davidson county showed their ap- 
preciation of the importance of this local aid to supplement the State 
action, by appropriating $11,000 for educational purposes in the 
county, outside of the city. The benefit of this small amount from 
the county is manifest in the school houses erected and the success 
of the schools in the county. The logic which urges an ample State 
and local tax is, I believe, conclusive. But practical experiments 
are generally more satisfactory than abstract reasoning. Fortun- 
ately, on this point in educational policy, they are numerous, and 
all lead to one conclusion—illustrating the wisdom of raising school 
revenue as provided in the revised school tax. Rather than use my 
own representation of these experiments, I introduce a most compe- 
tent and disinterested witness: Rev. Dr. Ryerson, of Ontario, Cana- 
da. In his special Report on Education in Europe and the United 
States, he makes the emphatic statement that, “In all those coun- 
tries, with the exception of England and Ireland, (but including 
Scotland), the elementary education of all classes, and especially of 
the poor, is made a charge upon the landed and other property of 
the nation. This charge is viewed, not as a burden or charity, but 
as a debt, as much as any other public charge—one of the condi- 
tions of the tenure of property, and one of the means by which the 
security and value of property are maintained and promoted. Had 
this principle been recognized in England and Ireland from the 
period of the Reformation, as in Protestant countries of the conti- 
nent, the lower classes would have been among the best, instead of 
being the worst educated and most wretched in Europe, except in 
some parts of Southern and Central Italy. Hundreds of millions, 
which have been expended in administration of poor laws and in 
relief of the poor, would have been saved; as also vast expenditures 
for reformatories and prisons, and the loss of the intelligent labor 
and good example of hundreds of thousands of the working classes. 
The annual Parliamentary grants for elementary education in the 
United Kingdom involve a much larger sum than is provided by the 
Legislature even in France for both elémentary and secondary edu. 
cation; but the education for which those grants provide does not
-P-A-G-E-99
99 
keep pace with the increase of the uneducated classes. Wor do Z 
believe that any material progress in the extension of elementary 
education in England will take place until the system of local rates 
on property for that purpose, ts established, and all the local interesta 
and influences, which local rating invariably develops, are brought 
to bear on the education of the masses.” 
In Massachusetts the State aid has been disbursed on condition . 
that one dollar and fifty cents per school child should be raised for 
educational purposes. The careful administration of the law, in 
reference to this point has alone freed many localities from an en- 
tire loss of schools. Too many would expend the State aid upon 
the building of school houses. 
A writer upon the revival of education in France half a century 
since, states a fact which illustrates this point. The State at first 
proposed to do all, and finally did nothing; but expended all its 
money in building school houses, and the grand scheme of the period 
did not establish a single school. The State expenditure being made 
without the compliance with any conditions on the part of the peo- 
ple, the entire plan was afailure. [See Appendix, F. and I.] 
The expenditure of the State fund for disbursement is only on con- 
dition of full compliance with the Jaw, and therefore instruction 
has assured its success. 
Remedy for the Constitutional Difficulties.—The friends of 
education, as obviating the difficulty presented in the decision of the 
Supreme Court, proposed to bring each civil district under the power 
of corporate towns; to levy a tax by so amending the school law, 
“That every civil district in the several counties of this State should 
bean incorporated town for school purposes, to be known by the name 
and number of the civil district ;” but the bill proposed failed. 
The subject is one demanding the early attention of legislation; 
and, if it is not in the power of legislation, that power should be 
given by the amendment of the constitution. No State will suc 
ceed in the present race for prosperity that does not allow its people 
to tax themselves for the education of their children. 
Schools Free.—The desirableness and necessity that all public 
schools should be free already appear in this report wherever it ap- 
proaches related topics. The excellence of this feature of the re- 
vised school law is beyond representation. It does not bring upon 
itself the odium of pauper schools. It has enabled us to reach a

much greater number of children than would otherwise have been 
possible. The States that ever allowed rate bills have found them 
most injurious to the interests of the schools. New York, the year 
after their abolition, reports an increase in the average attendance 
of 24,697 pupils, although the terms of school were on an average, 
two weeks and one day longer. Connecticut and Michigan, States 
that long retained the rate bill, report a similar experience. 
The tendencies of all improved systems of education is towards 
making the schools entirely free. No State abolishing rate bills has 
ever, to my knowledge, re-established them. Pennsylvania once at- 
tempted to do so but failed; and the man who, more than any other, 
was credited with the defeat of the backward move never afterwa: ds 
could ask of the people anything they were not ready to give, and 
remembered with more satisfaction that speech than any other in 
his prolonged and conspicuous public career. 
Uniformity of Text Books.—-I may adopt with emphasis the 
remark -so common in school reports: “A want of uniformity in 
text books has been a serious drawback on the progress of our 
schools.” I find in.a recent report of one of the oldest State sys- 
tems, where this vexatious question has been allowed to go by de- 
fault, the following significant statement : 
“The variety of text books on the same subject, which I find in very many 
schools, is a great hindrance to classification and progress. Each new teacher is 
allowed to introduce his favorite authors. New scholars from other districts, towns, 
or States, retain their old books. In one school I found seven classes in Geography, 
where, with uniformity of books, they would be reduced to three, to the great im- 
provement of the school. In another school, with nineveen scholars, there were 
six cla-ses in spelling, seven in reading, five in Arithmetic, and seven in Geography, 
The result is ‘confusion confounded,’ the embarrassment of the teacher, and dis- 
couragement of the pupil, Instead of system, classification, and thoroughness, the 
teacher’s time is wasted on a medley of text books. When no two have the same 
book, the recitations of each individual by himself must be hurried and super- 
ficial.” 
This subject received early and careful consideration as required 
by law. [See Appendix, D.and G.] The law, fortunately for the 
interests of the State, committed this difficult question to the super- 
vision of the State and county. 
The pecuniary interests of publishers introduces an embarrass- 
ment that does not enter into the question of merit. No one would 
think of leaving the choice of books to them; but, if they did de- 
termine the selection, there would be, not ohly interminable war,
-P-A-G-E-101
101 
but bitter feelings on the part of those who did not succeed. The 
selection left to the child, no one would be satisfied; no two would 
uniformly agree. Left to parents, there would be an improvement 
over leaving the decision and selection to the children. The variety 
would be somewhat reduced, and changes would not be so frequent, 
but the evils would be still unendurable in schools. Few families 
would agree, and the diversity would well nigh equal the number of 
families sending to the school. The selection left to the teacher, 
there would be still an improvement in the school. He would be 
likely to have all of the same grade of qualifications supplied with 
the same books; and so secure the best economy of classification. 
But the change of teacher would involve a change of books. 
Better still would be the authority of the district directors to select 
the books. Changes in the district would be less frequent; but few 
districts lying contiguous to each other would agree, and every child 
or family that removed from one district to another would be sub- 
jected to the expense of a new set of text books. The selection left 
to the county would be still better; all these evils would be reduced ; 
yet rarely two counties agree, and every child transferring his resi- 
dence from one county to another would be obliged to buy new books. 
Our poorest population—those who can least afford the expense— 
are movable. By looking at our census reports, it will be seen that 
the colored population goes from district to district, and from county 
to county—a single year showing great changes. The selection, as 
now made for the State, by the united action of the State Superin- 
tendent and County Superintendents is the only method which pre- 
vents all these evils. It gives a uniform set of text books for the 
State. ‘They could hardly pass the serutiny of a majority of such 
a body of men without possessing merit. The amounts saved to the 
people, over and above the expense by any other system, securing an 
annual change would be, as it is estimated, $70,000 a year, to say 
nothing of the saving of time, by reducing the number of classes in 
the different schools. A school of eighteen scholars reports as high 
as twenty-four classes. Sometimes the number of classes in reading 
equals the number of scholars. This destroys all possibility of class 
emulation, and subdivides the time of the teacher to a degree that 
renders his instruction almost useless. Good progress is being made 
towards uniformity. 
Graded Schools.—A specially wise feature of the revised law is 
its provision for graded schools. This is simply introducing into
-P-A-G-E-102
102 
school management some of the best principles of political economy - 
[See Appendix, pp. 21 and 22.] Eighty or eight thousand children 
are to be provided with instruction within a given unit of territorial 
organization. The graded school system does not form a separate 
class for each pupil in each subject, but arranges the places of at- 
tendance centrally, and classifies the pupils in each branch, so that 
those of the same advancement recite together; reducing the number 
of classes, and bringing under each teacher only such a number of 
classes as will occupy his time, preventing the loss of teaching hours 
and energy; economising the expense of instruction, and assuring 
better work ; carrying the instruction higher than is otherwise pos-~ 
sible, and securing to the spirit of the schools the benefit of all the 
active motives to effort coming from a proper association of the 
young of similar stages of progress in similar pursuits. 
Says an eductional writer: ‘The benefits of close gradation are 
becoming more and more evident each year, and it will be found 
that the child who is permitted to pass through the several grades 
of our schools in the ordinary prescribed course of study, will have 
performed the work with greater ease, in shorter period of time, and 
much more accurately than he could have done under the old form 
of mixed schools.” 
Success of these Schools.—It is, as has already been noticed, 
a special object in the disbursement of the Peabody fund, to promote 
the establishment of this improved class of schools. Their multi- 
plication over the State has been gratifying, as well as the uniform 
success which has attended them.* 
The school law is defective in reference to graded schools, in pro- 
viding for only a term of five months annually. The welfare of the 
young, and convenience of parents, demand, in concentrated popu- 
lations, schools for not less than ten months, The law, in this re- 
spect, needs amendment. Every incorporated town in the State 
  
*CuaTTaNnooga GrapeD Scoot —Mr. Woodbury gives, in the Knowville Whig, 
an interesting account of the graded school in Chattanooga, taught by J.S. Wiltse. 
After commending the exercises highly, he adds: 
“It is but justice to say that there was no cramming for this examination. The only prepara- tion for it was the frequent reviewing throughout entire term. More than all this, it has evi- dently been the aim of the teachers to cause their pupils to think earnestly, and correctly to. compare, and to acguire habits of personal investigation. 
“But the school is adjourned. This excellent effort will have been, after all, of little avail. 
It has become only an incidental circumstance. These budding powers are given over to weeds, for seven months. What natural ability, or untrained, although zealous, enthusiasm of child- 
hood, will survive this periodical waste?” . 
When shall we haave a law extending our graded schools more than five months?
-P-A-G-E-103

should make haste to establish a thorough, ample and growing sys- 
tem of graded schools. Now, in the principal villages of most of 
the States in the country, the child of the mechanic, who is borne 
down with daily toil in the support of his family, can, without a 
dollar’s expense, in the free graded schools, step into a path of 
competition for the highest honors of sholarship with the son of the 
wealthiest. The actual taxation in such village is not greater than’ 
in similar villages in Tennessee; but there it is chiefly spent for 
education; here, chiefly for police. Is it because the wealthy there 
prefer to educate, and here prefer to punish, the children of the 
poor? ‘This may be the result, but it cannot be the general and de- 
liberate intention. Jn this fact is seen sufficient reason for the man- 
ufactories which cluster around those villages in other States, and 
make them thriving manufacturing centers, hives of wealth, and 
profitable markets for the farmers of the surrounding country. A 
skillful mechanic, with a large family of children, finds this a con- 
trolling motive in seeking a home. To pay the tuition of his chil- 
dren at school, would cost him more than he can earn. He cannot 
suffer them to grow up in ignorance, and goes where they can be 
educated free. And the town makes well out of him; his skill, 
whether in wood, iron or leather, is what its landed and mercantile 
profits demand; and, by the town’s teaching more, and having to 
police. less, these sons of mechanics, with their ideas of economy and 
industry, become, most likely, the pillars of the community in the 
next generation. Nothing is so profitable as the production of men 
of intelligence and virtue. 
Our Country Schools.—These are especially exposed to neglect. 
Many of them are not within a free and general circulation of books. 
They are out of the currents of thought which drive forward im- 
provements in cities. Often, the population is sparse. There are 
serious etnbarrassments in the way of combining a cultivated edu- 
cational sentiment sufficiently strong, to erect good school-houses, 
and secure a regular and punctual attendance. But, neither the 
State, nor the country people can afford to allow any of these things 
to deter them from success, 
Our cities, as a rule, do not produce the men who preserve their 
commercial or intellectual supremacy. The country is the great 
source of supply for characters of vigor. The children of the coun- 
try should have such educational opportunities so amply furnished
-P-A-G-E-104
104 
them, that the usual reasons for hastening to the city will not exist. 
The vast agricultural, manufacturing and mining opportunities of- 
fered in this State, the beauties and grandeurs of scenery, should 
not be overlooked. Better, far, that the tendency for the young 
should be from the city to the country. Health and purity are 
surer there, 
“From school and ball, and rout she came, 
The city's fair, pale daughter, 
To drink the wine of mountain air 
Beside the Bearcump Water. 
“Her step grew firmer on the hills 
That watch our homestends over; 
On cheek and lip, from the summer fields, 
She caught the bloom of clover.” 
Au efficient system of county free schools, is its best possible 
means of balancing these influences. Out of them will spring the 
intelligence and refinement to adorn and render homes attractive, 
and the skill to render the farmer’s toil more remunerative, and 
thus afford him the means of surrounding himself and his family 
with books, instruments of music, and works of art, that hurry so 
many prematurely, without safeguards or means of success in any 
honorable position, into the busy whirl of city life. Improve the 
country schools if you would make country life more attractive, or 
increase the products of the farm. Certain European Clergy have 
the habit of saying, “All evil comes from the town.” This is not 
yet true of American civilization; it would soon however, be too 
nearly so, if intelligence has not proper aids in the country. It is 
not only true as inforced by Franklin, that “Learning is better than 
house and lands,” but according to the truth embodied in the 
Spanish Proverb, “He is the best scholar who has learned to live 
well,” learning furnishes the surest means of securing both, and 
giving them value; not only does the owner himself need this learn- 
ing, but his own enjoyment and the value of his property require 
that all around him should share it. Says a writer: 
“We are not aware, perhaps, how much the value of property depends upon the 
state of morals and education in the place where it is located. Some time ago, for 
instance, there was @ certain farm, delightful for its surrounding scenery, on the 
bank of a winding river, enriched with orchards, prolific in fruit, grain and grass, 
having every advantage that nature could bestow. Yet, when this was offered for 
sale, no respectable purchaser could be found that would give for it one-half of its 
worth. Why was itso? The explanation is easy, Education and morals were at 
a low ebb in the neighborhood where it was located. The people, many of them,
-P-A-G-E-105
105 
gave little, cared little, for educational or religious institutions. It was environed 
with settlements where ignorance, joined as it commonly is with the habits of drink- 
ing, rum selling, sabbath-breaking, and their attendant vices, prevailed.” 
A proper dissemination of intelligence gives assured honor to 
the cultivation of the soil. No State can afford to permit a course 
of events which shall throw disgrace upon the tillers of its soil. 
“God speed the plough-share! Tell me not 
Disgrace attends the toil, y 
Of those who plough the dark greén sod, 
Or till the fruitful soil. 
Why should the honest. ploughman shrink 
From mingling in the van 
Of learning and of wisdom, since 
*4is mind that makes the man. 
“ God speed the plough-share, and the hands 
That till the fruitful earth; 
For there is in the world so wide 
No gem like honest worth. 
And, though the hands are dark with toil, 
And fiushed the manly brow, 
It matters not, for God will bless 
The labors of the plough.” 
Farmers, if they expect the honors of manhood for their sons, 
and the tastes and attractiveness of womanhood for their daughters, 
must give them more opportunities than the ox under the yoke, or 
the favorite dog with which they sport. Their minds must be cul- 
tivated, their characters improved; neither all play, which makes 
Jack a mere toy, nor all work, which makes Jack a dull boy, will 
answer. ‘The farmer glorying in the privileges of the country for 
his children, giving them all the benefits of training in labor, in the 
field and in the house, may fitly exhort them in the words of the 
poet: 
. ‘Deeper, deeper, let us toil 
In the mines of knowledge, 
Nature’s wealth and learning’s spoil, 
Win from school and college, 
Delve we there for richer gems 
Than the stars of diadem. 
“Onward, onward we will pass 
Through the path of duty— 
Virtue is true happiness, 
Excellence true beauty. 
Minds are of superval birth— 
Let us make a heaven of earth.” 
Teaching the Constitution of the United States and of 
the State of Tennessee.—The feature of the school law requir- 
ing this instruction, will always vindicate itself to the patriotic

as a government, depend upon the intelligence of the people. We 
boast that every principle is submitted to the people, and determin- 
ed by them; yet as a matter of fact, how little is generally known, 
either of the fundamental principles of our government, or of the 
details of their practical developement, or the laws on our statute 
books? I need not make any special statement of facts in regard 
to Tennessee. The necessity is general, and I quote in preference 
to any words of my own, the following in regard to one of the lead- 
ing Western States : 
‘Let such questions as the following be propounded: 
“What three forms of government existed among the thirteen original colonies, 
prior to the Revolution. Define each of those three forms of government. Which 
of the colonies were under a Provincial or Royal government? Which were un- 
der a Proprietary government? Which of them had Charter government? 
Throvgh what three distinct forms has the Government. of the United States passed? 
When did each form begin and end? What is the history of the Articles of Con- 
federation? What led to the abandonment of the Vonfederate form of government, 
and the adoption of the Constitutional? What States were represented in the Con- 
stitutional Convention? Who was chosen President? Who were the delegates? 
When did the present Constitution go into operation, that is, how long has the 
présent form of government existed? Give an analysis of the fundamental law. 
State “the principles upon which the government is founded—the political and iv- 
dividual rights of the citizens--and the manner in which the sovereign powers are 
organized, distributed and administered.” These points are few, and strictly 
elementary, yet how many of our citizens can answer them? Can one in a hun- 
dred of the uneducated? Can one in ten of the boys in the advanced classes of 
our graded and high schools? Can ail the graduates of our colleges, seminaries, 
and universities, answer them ?” 
For want of text-books on the subject, the instruction in our 
schools has only been oral, and in many instances it is believed to 
be entirely omitted, on account of the lack of governmental infor- 
mation on the part of teachers. However, public attention has been 
turned to the subject; the bug bears started in regard to it have 
come to naught, and a more healthy. appreciation of its necessity, 
objects and benefits, prevails. 
Libraries —The State Library, now for sometime under the 
scholarly Dr. A. Gattinger, the special monument of the wisdom 
and foresight of R. J. Meigs and his co-laborers, whose care and 
toil nourished its growth, is a most valuable collection of books, and 
an honor to the State. But, alas! it is poorly supported by libra. 
ries for use among the people. Indeed, on inquiry in the first year 
of my service here, I ascertained that not a free circulating library 
“existed in the State.
-P-A-G-E-107
107 
The moderate-sized college libraries will appear in connection with 
their respective institutions. The lack of good books is supplied as 
far ag supplied at all, alas! too generally, by such shameless publi- 
cations as the “ Police Gazette.”” Says Mr. Northrup, ‘“ Obscene 
books, papers and pictures are the worst of outlaws.” No honest 
friend of virtue can contemplate the dissemination of very much of 
the reading matter sold on our railways, and at news-stands, without 
misgivings. Ask our booksellers, and they will tell you how few 
good and substantial books are bought. ‘Travel through the coun- 
try, and you will see the dearth of good reading, in the midst of 
which the young are growing up. Libraries must be to many the 
sources of knowledge. As crystal fountains sparkle among our hills 
and mountains, so should the gems of thought in free circulating 
libraries, for the benefit of the young in all our country towns. But 
even our cities are as yet without these inestimable sources of good. 
Says Dr. Turner: “(As an educational force the public library is 
second only to the public school.” 
Dr. H. L. W. Burret writes Mr. Northrup: 
“ My own opinion is that the power of district libraries as an educational force 
is ten-fold that of any public library. Books in school district library reach 
thousands who would never pay the slight expense nor take a book from a public 
library, and those too who eminently need the lessons taught by them. 
“T give you the following axioms, as I think them: 
“1, The masses of the people will be better reached by district libraries than by 
any other plan conceivable. 
**2. Many who do not take a newspaper, that greatest of the educational powers 
of to-day, will learn to read and appreciate a book picked up on the fireside table. 
“8. Should the State by statute furnish to each district funds fora small library, 
end compel it to give an equal amount, such library would be well read, and would 
reach ten minds where any public library does one. 
“Given a free book—fireside book—a child’s influence—what method can you 
desire to reach the mind of a laboring man or mechanic better than that ? 
“Great, massive, marble public institutions, libraries, ete., have been reared in 
this country to please the eye and taste of a few rich and learned men. The public 
school is the only gift of society to the great working masses of the State. It alone 
needs more money, more power, more books. When will our politicians get the 
idea out of their heads that public schools are a charity, and that they are to be 
doled out as such to the people!” 
Massachusetts has the following law upon the subject : 
“Each town and city may establish and maintain a public library therein, with 
or without branches, for the use of the inhabitants thereof, and provide suitable 
rooms therefor, under such regulations as may from time to time, be prescribed by 
the inhabitants of the town, or by the City Council.
-P-A-G-E-108
108 
“ Any town or city may appropriate money for suitable buildings or rooms, and 
for the foundation of such library, a sum not exceeding one dollar fur each of its 
ratable polls, in the year next preceding that in which such appropriation is made; 
may also appropriate annually, for the maintenance and increase thereof, a sum 
not exceeding fifty cents for each of its ratable polls, in the year next preceding 
that in which such appropriation is made, and receive, hold and manage any devise 
bequest, or donation, for the establishment, increase, or maintenance of a public 
library within the same.” 
Hon. Caleb Cushing, then Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, 
as he read the bill, gave it his cordial approval, saying that “it did 
not need reference to any committee.” It was accordingly reported, 
and, without such reference, was adopted unanimously. After a 
trial of seventeen years, this law commands the general approval of 
the people. 
These libraries now, it is believed, contain over a million volumes ; 
some single libraries in smaller towns containing as high as 400 
volumes. What powers for good would such libraries be, scattered 
throughout the State ! 
Stone, the noted mathematician, explained to those who wondered 
how he ever acquired so much knowledge: “ Why, I first learned 
the twenty-six letters of the alphabet, and then I found that by 
means of these I could learn anything else that I wished to learn.” 
The present child of genius, with libraries widely scattered, could 
have a chance to illustrate this truth. 
Mr. Northrup, Secretary of the Board ot Education for Con- 
necticut, well says: 
“A studious youth, in a secluded house, would, on some winter’s evening, sit 
down, with his tallow candle, to peruse a book of travels from one of these libraries, 
perhaps reading portions of it to the listening family. In imagination he would 
range through various climes, and among various nations, until, in his delight, he 
could enjoy them as if his own. In the language of Goldsmith, he could say: 
“Ye glittring towns, with wealth and splendor crowned; 
Ye fields, whose summer spreads profusion round; 
Ye lakes, whose vessels catch the busy gale; 
Ye bending swains that dress the fow’ry vale, 
For me your tributary stores combine; 
Creation’s heir, the world, the world is mine.’ 
“He could enjoy all the delights of the traveler, without his fatigues, exposures 
and temptations.” 
So all learning is brought within his reach. It has been with me 
a most earnest desire to see all of these benefits speedily secured to 
the youth of Tennessee. An outline of a plan has been communi-
-P-A-G-E-109
109 
eated to the County Superintendents. With a few to aid them in 
securing action in their respective counties, I suggested that the 
Legislature should enact : 
“That for the purpose of encouraging reading, and of extending its benefits to 
those now unable to receive them, that the Executive School Board of exch county, 
together with the Superintendent of Instruction, shall constitute a Library Board, 
of which the Superintendent of Public Instruction shall be Librarian and Secre- 
tary ; that said Board shall elect a President, and are hereby granted the neces 
sary corporate powers for the conduct of a free-cirenlating Library, and of a 
Lyceum; to receive, hold and sell property, receive bequests, and to establish regu_ 
lations for the preservation, circulation and use of books and other reading matter, 
within said county; and further, that said Library shall be in the office of said 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, or elsewhere, as the Board may direct. And 
furthermore, that it shall be lawful for the County Court to encourage the increase 
of said Library, by the payment of necessary expenses, or the appropriation of 
money for the purchase of books; and hereafter, for the purpose of preserving for 
reference, in each county, & history of the State, each County Library shall be en- 
titled to, und shall receive, in the distribution of the same, a copy of all acts and 
publications of the General Assembly, and of the Executive and Judicial Depart- 
ments of the State Government, and that the expense of the same shall be met as is 
usual in the case of similar publications, 
The effort failed; but I would earnestly commend it to future 
legislators. 
COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, 
The State has, at different periods, aided three universities—one 
in each grand Division—but has no such connection with them as to 
authorize this office to exert any direct influence over them. But 
their relation, and that of other incorporated institutions, to general 
education is such, that I took the liberty to address to a large num- 
ber in the State the following letter: 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Orrick SUPERINTENDENT PuBuic InsTRucrION, 
Nasuvinix, September 10, 1869. 
Dear Sir: Believing that you hold with me that the interests of learning 
are one, and that free schools, in all their grades, must depend upon the colleges 
and universities for their efficiency, and that the university and the college must 
look to the primary and other grades of schools for their supply of students for 
honorable matriculation; and, further, that in a report of the State System of Schools 
it is fit that all institutions should be represented for their own benefit, and for the 
information of the pub‘ic, I take the liberty, in preparing the report from this office, 
to ask you for the following statistics in reference to your institution, The reports

State Superintendent. 
Valuable replies have been received from a considerable number 
of Institutions, all of which are presented in the Appendix. While 
it is gratifying that these and other similar Institutions have been 
‘able, since the war, to accomplish so much, there is manifestly still, 
in the higher education they offer, a deplorable deficiency. These 
Institutions, instead of their present limited attendance, should be 
filled to their overflowing; and, in place of doing so much of the 
primary work, should find that so well done that they would have 
all they can do in the sphere of collegiate and professional studies. 
Their first work for themselves is the elevation and perfection of 
free, universal education ; and I am happy to recognize, on the part 
of the officers of these Institutions, an appreciation of this fact. 
The spirit of giving, for the education of the young, needs to possess 
the hearts of our citizens of wealth, that these Institutions may pass 
from the weakness of poverty into the strength and growth of 
abundance. May we not hope, too, that the State may, at an early 
day, so perfect its educational system that the college and uni- 
versity shall, as well as the Primary and High School, offer a free 
education to every aspiring son of Tennessee.

THE SCHOOLS IN MEMPHIS AND NASHVILLE 
These cities are the only ones in the State so fortunate as to have 
permanently organized, classified and graded free schools, under 
competent professional supervision.. Nashville is more fortunate 
than Memphis, in having early provided some good school-houses 
Some of the teachers and schools in each city will compare favora- 
bly with any in the country. Memphis, under a better school law, 
is now making more rapid progress in erecting good school-houses. 
Financially, both cities have suffered from a lack of promptness, on 
the part of the State, in paying over the School Fund. Each sys- 
tem has had a severe struggle for recognition by certain classes in 
the community. For some time, however, no one has been able to 
claim better instruction for any other schools than that which is 
given in the free schools of Nashville; and, having the advantage of 
fair buildings, those free schools have overcome opposition, and won 
an approval that can be lost only by defective management. Each 
of these cities suffers for lack of manufactures. These schools, 
when well known, will furnish a special motive to skillful mechanics 
to locate near them. Already, we hear of parents seeking Nash- 
ville as a residence for the education of their children. Whatever 
success has attended these schools in the past, their officers have 
have come to no place for rest. Their progress in improvements 
should be steady, and keep pace with the best schools in the coun- 
try. Not a day can come without some defect to be removed, some 
advantage to be gained. What they accomplish will be specially 
dependent upon the efficiency of the supervision. Friends of edu- 
cation in the State should take notice that supervision has been the 
special instrumentality by which these schools have been brought to 
such a degree of excellence. They should take courage, too, from 
the favor with which they are now regarded by the best citizens. 
The same approval follows well established and well conducted free 
schools everywhere. ft 
Several special duties seem to devolve upon these advanced city 
educational systems : 
1, They should do more to disseminate, not only within their own 
limits, but throughout the State a knowledge of what free schools 
are, and a sentiment in their support: (a) by the publication of re- 
ports; (b) by bringing their excellencies more before the public 
observation of educational meetings.
-P-A-G-E-112
112 
2. They should do more for the training and improvement of 
teachers—their own teachers—all teachers need it; but these 
schools should be making teachers by the dozens yearly, and these 
city systems should give them an opportunity for special training in 
the theory and practice of teaching, The officers of the city sys- 
tem of schools will fail properly to respond to the relation of city 
culture and capital to the surrounding country, who do not seck ag 
far as in their power to disseminate all the exccllencies of good 
training and education. There is a limit to all city growth in the 
midst of a surrounding country of ignorance and correspondingly 
unskillful and unproductive industries. 
3. They should institute publ‘¢ libraries. 
.4, They should institute reformatory institutions for the education 
of juvenile offenders. They have in their midst the population 
especially in need of these institutions, and their Boards of Educa- 
tion should meet the responsibility of obtaining the facts, taking the 
evidence, and pressing the State action to successful conclusions. 
I am happy to be able to present, in the Appendix, information in 
regard to the Nashville Schools. 
CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS. 
The charitable institutions of the State hold a most important 
relation to public education, indeed are some of them especially 
educational ; and all of them, like the public school, are intended 
to alleviate the ills to which man is heir. They spring from a noble 
Christian charity that is not satisfied with leaving the defective in 
mind, or sight, or hearing, or speech, to the family in which they 
were born, or to the overflowing of voluntary benevolence. 
The Lunatic Asylum—Presenting a melancholy view of mind 
in its wreck, enforces the importance of all those wisely conceived 
instrumentalities and methods of training which may reduce the 
number of the insane by preventing the conditions of insanity. 
The asylums for the deaf and dumb and for the blind are also re- 
sults of the same charitable Christian conception of man. They 
unjock the doors of knowledge to those otherwise specially excluded 
by natural defects. They are schools for teaching those who cannot 
be taught elsewhere. All these institutions do honor to the 
State, and deserve wise and ample aid,
-P-A-G-E-113

THE PENITENTIARY. 
‘ . 
This stands over against every home and school in ths State. 
Its inmates have numbered, during the year, 511, of whom 102 
could neither read nor write. Go among them, seck the origin or 
date of their first steps towards ruin ; how uniformly are you pointed 
to a nevlected, misdirected or vicious youth? Something more or 
better of home influence, or school influence, might have prevented 
their career of peril to the community, and of cost to the State. 
Moreover, the greater the degradation in crimes, the more likely are: 
we to find a corresponding greater neglect. Hun. J.P. Wickersham 
Superintendent of Public Instruction for Pennsylvania, obser: es, 
after reviewing the criminal statistics of the State: “It is found 
that the uneducated convicts in our penitentiaries have committed, 
in much larger proportion, than the educated, crimes against per- 
sons— crimes arising from unrestrained passions—gross, revolting 
crimes, like murder, manslaughter and rape. 
The cost of the Penitentiary is fabulous. Its weight upon the 
Treasury of the State is great. Who would not sooner pay the same 
money out for education than for punishment? “Attention is invited 
to facts appearing under the head of “Statistics,” and to Appendix. 
It has been gratifying to find in the Penitentiary considerable 
opportunity for reading, an.l that upon the Sabbath, for an hour, 
persons of Christian zeal are ready to go in and teach those in the 
Scriptures. who are disposed to study them. The prison undoubt- 
edly contains many who should be: sent to a reformatory institution, 
if there was one in the State. Their presence increases manifold 
the desirableness of instruction and the hopefulness of results in 
simparting it. The spirit of Christianity so pervading the age, the 
consideration of our common humanity forbid the omission of any 
effort which may reform or improve a single inmate even of this 
home of criminals. Often we hear it said a convict goes out im- 
proved, by learning a trade. Would he not be much more improved, 
and the State and community afforded corresponding advantage, if 
he would there learn the trade of virtuous conduct? 
Jails.—In traveling about the State, Ihave taken occasion, as I 
have had opportunity, to observe the condition of the jails. Some, 
as that at Elizabethton, are in a deplorable condition; others, as 
at Memphis, Shelbyville and Pulaski, are among the structures 
8
-P-A-G-E-114
114 
which impress a stranger, and are generally in an excellent condi- 
tion. The one in Shelby County cost not less than a quarter of a@ 
million, and that in Bedford, and also that in Giles, over twenty 
thousand dollars each. It is a significant fact, that neither of these 
counties have, by tax, expended anything like the same amount on 
school-houses. When this relation of expenditure is changed, or 
even when these counties have expended as much upon school- 
houses as upon their jails, it may be safely submitted they will have 
less to pay for crime. 
I have taken great pains to get some correct idea of the cost of 
crime in the State. The result will be found under the head of 
“Statistics.” “ 
Much could be done to prevent the dissemination of crime by the 
separation of the young and less hardened persons committed from 
the adepts and confirmed criminals. ; 
INTERMEDIATE REMEDIAL INSTITUTIONS. 
Free, universal education, proposes to leave no. child out of its 
benefits. Many States, to render these results sure, have adopted a 
law, making it obligatory on every child to have, annually, a speci- 
fied number of months’ training in school. It may be either in 
private or public schools. We have already noticed the success of 
this feature of school laws. But where the most has been done, 
there is still a considerable number who w-ll early get some taste 
of crime. These, condemned at once to the jail or Penitentiary, 
are simply put to the school of crime under adepts as teachers. 
They must be expected to come out worse than they entered. 
Thus, the very system of justice becomes an aid to progress in 
crime. When the young have taken these preliminary steps in 
crime, society revolts at their mingling freely in the associations of 
the innocent. They are not expected to attend school in common 
with others. Therefore, if not confined in the jail or Penitentiary, 
they are abroad in the streets and in the resorts of vice and crime, 
preparing for their perpetration. War always greatly increases 
this class of young vagabonds and criminals. They constitute a 
class of criminals by themselves. Out of it graduate the most of 
the adept robbers, thieves and murderers. They are an enigma to
-P-A-G-E-115
115 ‘ 
*. 
Judges and juries. The common punishments do.no good, only to 
restrain them for the time. They should be under the care of 
fathers and mothers and schools; but all these their hardness has 
long since condemned. No common agencies of good are anything 
to them. The church can only reach them through a special adapta- 
tion of its benevolent agencies to them. Looking at criminal 
dockets, any one will see how often some of those names appear 
and reappear, as if the courts were, in a measure, only judicial 
mills, to grind their cases over and over again. Estimate the cost 
of each of these respective trials to the State, and of all their con- 
finements, and we reach some idea of what the cost of one of these 
young criminals is destined to be. Besides this class, there are 
others who, later in life, against their early instruction, fall out of 
the path of virtue. Cast into the common prison they are lost, and 
yet they are too guilty to be abroad for the time in society. Evi- 
dently, society and the State must make some provision for this 
class of persons, between the school, where the virtuous young are 
trained, and the Penitentiary, where the confirmed or greater crim- 
inals are confined, or be exposed to all their stealing, robbing and 
murdering; and, finally, in preference, bear the burden of their ex- 
pensive trials and continued imprisonment.. Intelligent statesmen 
have ceased to hesitate. They have established, in various coun- 
tries and States, a class of reformatory and punitive institutions, 
where juvenile offenders are received, put to industry, and subjected 
toa firm but kind treatment, which results, on an average, in re- 
turning three-fourths of them to society, good citizens. And stub- 
born cases, that will go on from bad to worse, it has been found 
cheaper to restrain in institutions where they may be employed at 
some productive industry, than to let them go at large, exposing 
property and life to their repeated crimes, and the State to a cor- 
responding multiplication of costs. In some instances, private 
charity takes the initiative in these efforts, But the policy of es- 
tablishing these institutions has been so successful, that they are 
steadily increasing in our country. No such institution exists in 
Tennessee. There is no Board of State Charities, with all those 
subjects under their control, calling legislative and public attention 
to the evils and cost of crime, and the best means and methods of 
preventing or reducing them. But the educator cannot overlook 
them, or regard them with indifference. Every child abandoned to
-P-A-G-E-116
116 
crime is a direct loss to the production of wealth and virtue, and a 
perpetual threat of evil or expense to those who support themselves 
and sustain the State. 
SABBATH SCHOOLS. 
These are often regarded as exclusively sectarian agencies, yet 
any one fully informed in regard to their work is well aware how 
little of what is dogmatic in theology, and how much of what is 
simple and forcible in morals and. piety, constitute the burthen of 
their instruction, . But should they be as sectarian of any or all 
denominations as their enemies charge, no friend of the young, no 
earnest educator can regard with indifference, or without approval, 
their worth in Tennessee since the war. Thousands have thus 
Jearned to read who had no other means of acquiring a knowledge 
of letters. They have added to the interest in public educa- 
tion, and in some cases increased the attendance upon our schools. 
Their friends are friends of light and virtue. These schools, too, 
have a most salutary effect in sowing the seeds of virtue, of pre- 
venting the progress of crime among the young, and thus of con- 
tributing to the good order and security of communities. Their 
rapid spread in portions of the State during the past year has been 
especially gratifying. 
EVENING SCHOOLS. 
There has not been, I have thought, in some of the larger towns 
of the State sufficient attention to the conduct of evening schools. 
The war has left many a mechanic without the knowledge of common 
subjects he would have acquired in times of peace; besides, it has 
left him too poor and hard pressel for him to spare time from his 
daily labors for stuly. He feels that his ignorance cramps his 
manhood, and limits the skill of his industry; and, if there was 
some place where instruction is given out cf the hours of labor, he 
would avail himself of. its benefits with avidity. Evening schools 
furnish this opportunity. Boards of Education in our large towns 
should annually consider the importance of opening them in the 
winter months.
-P-A-G-E-117
117 
SCHOOL SUPERVISION. 
The supervision provided in the law accords” with the results of 
the best educational experience ih this and other countries. Yet it 
hag been the object of great opposition and unmeasured misrepre- 
sentation. No enemy of the system failed to see that the super- 
vision, State and county, was its vital part. If the supervision 
could be destroyed, the destruction of the rest of the system was 
easy. Every disorderly person, whose chance for the exercise of 
his propensity, would be limited by the advance of intelligence and 
virtue, every foe to the education of the people, every opponent of 
the education of the poor, every opposer of graded schools, every 
one disinclined to be taxed for educational purposes, every one who 
would use the funds for schools in some other way, everybody op- 
posed to what is new, simply because it 7s new to him, whether good 
or bad, had a blow to strike at supervision. Honest and fair- 
minded men found difficulty in getting at the truth in regard to its 
objects and its usefulness. Theoretically contemplating the s:tua- 
tion, before any organization was effected, no better agency could 
be devised to accomplish the object sought. The law represented 
the express will of the State; its execution had to proceed from 
one source, giving one interpretation, administering it equally, al- 
lowing no neglect, no fraud, inspiring all counties and districts with 
its high and beneficial aims. Its history and results confirm the 
theoretical view. When the code was operative before the war, it 
could and did include only whites; it did not touch the question here 
so difficult—of educating blacks. 
However, in localities here and there, where there was some man 
or men to be to the community more than the law, good was accom- 
plished. Some schools of value were taught, but more of no value, 
and more by far than the law required were not opened at all. 
Large amounts of money, disbursed by the State, were invested in 
houses on private lands, to which the owner laid claim, to the exclu- 
sion of the public. 
Very considerable amounts went to private schools, over which 
the officers of the law had no control. Generally, rate bills pre- 
vailed, and those too poor to pay were excluded after the State 
dole was exkausted. The spirit of caste grew and flourished 
under its culture. The poor were made to feel, even in childood, 
that there was an impassable gulf between them and the rich. The
-P-A-G-E-118
118 
worst passions, which finally upheave a State, were engendered. 
The system was utterly inadequate to educate even the entire white 
population. It had no central force, energizing the whole body— 
giving growth in correctness and perfection to all its parts. Records 
were not kept, as a rule; reports were not made. The State could 
not tell then, and cannot tell now, whether the State aid then did 
much or little. 
There was no way in which the people could see whether the 
work was done well or ill. ‘After the State was revived, at the 
close of the war, the old law had two years to show its excellence 
before it was revised. It did not offer the cup of knowledge toa 
single child. It had no living center—had no life in its members. 
The weeds of vice and crime had no resistance, found no obstruc- 
tion, as they spread in the hearts of the young, arising from the 
school laws of the Code. The need of supervisicn is further seen 
in the fact that even the revised law was a dead letter, as already no- 
ticed, until this supervision commenced. Districts neither elected 
Directors nor took the scholastic population, though specifically 
required. Every step waited for the application of the motive 
power. 
State School Supervision.—The State Superintendont is elected 
for a term of two years, by the people; and necessarily, whether he 
would, as an educator, or not, he does become related to party politics. 
He is more likely to be selected, from his relation to a party, than 
on account of his fitness or skill as an educator. But there is also, 
notwithstanding this objection, an advantage in the election by the 
people, in the greater amount of educational discussion, pro and 
con., likely to occur; and, with the advance of intelligence, what- 
ever party should hold sway, his ability and attainments alone can 
assure him any chance of success in seeking their suffrages. In 
some States the Superintendent is elected by the joint ballot of the 
Senate and House of Representatives. This, with many, is a fa- 
vorite method, and it agrees with the manner pursued in different 
States, of electing other subordinate State officers. Quite » number 
of States establish a State Board of Education, of eminent citizens, 
of which the Governor or State officers are ex-officio members, those 
who are citizens being nominated to the Senate by the Governor, 
and serving one year or two years, so that the Board always has a 
large majority familiar with its effects during the year, at any time 
immediately precedent. Although the Board may embrace the
-P-A-G-E-119
119 
officers of the State, yet the majority are very sure to be well out 
of the reach of partisan feelings. This Board elects a Secretary, 
likely, if possible, to be still further removed from partisan feeling, 
who has an adequate salary, and supervises the schools, under the 
direct advice of the Board. The most eminent educators more gen- 
erally. perhaps, favor this method. Or, again, he is nominated by 
the Governor, and confirmed by the Senate. But no State now at- 
tempting a vigorous system of education, expects to succeed without 
this State supervision. Prussia, Switzerland, Holland and Sweden, 
are illustrations, and, as a rule, the States in the American Union. 
Tn some instances, the Educational Department has been put in. 
charge of some other State officer—in one State the Secretrry, in 
another the Treasurer; but this plan has uniformly failed, and a 
separate officer, skillful to direct education, has been selected, and 
clerical assistance furnished him. The term of service, in some in- 
stances, is two years, but often four. Tooshort terms of service, too 
frequent changes of the head of the department, have been found 
specially deleterious to the public schools. 
The Duties of the State Superintendent—Are regulated by 
underlying general principles, which correspond, in general, in the 
different States, though differing considerably in their details. 
They look to the successful enforcement of the law, the report of 
what is done, and the information of officers and people, in regard 
to all improvements required to keep up with the educational 
progress of the age. His duties embrace not only the keeping of a 
system of records and accounts, and the.carrying on of a most varied 
and extensive correspondence, which requires a vast amount of cler- 
ical work, but traveling, lecturing, and the studying of educational 
principles and systems, as illustrated in the various civilized quar- 
ters of the globe. He must kecp a steady move’ forward, yet con- 
duct it with such wisdom, that no backward step need be taken. 
The partial services of an already overtasked officer, provided in 
the law, who must do all he does clerically for the office elsewhere, 
is most inadequate. A proposition to furnish one clerk was made 
before the last Legislature, but failed. Perhaps the slight compara- - 
tive expensive of a single man could not have been applied in any 
other way, with such great benefit to the prosperity of the State. 
Lack of such clerical aid has limited all of the work I had laid out 
to do, outside of the office. It could not be accomplished without 
the power to be in two distant places at the same time.
-P-A-G-E-120
120 
Method of Doing Business.—Every consideration enforced 
the necessity of the most simple methods of doing the business of 
the office, consistent with accuracy. There was no clerk to mark, 
and index, and file, papers; no one to take exclusively in hand the 
correspondence; no one to keep his eye exclusively on the financial 
papers——their coming, and going, and filing. The mind of the Su- 
perintendent, over-occupied with the general work in hand, must 
also attend to all their details. Every paper must go through his 
hands. ‘ 
The Finances,—Upon this point I must invite special attention 
to the Appendix. ‘The law provided for the receipt by the State 
Superintendent, of school moneys. His heavy bond was given for 
their security. There seemed to be a better way. All moneys for 
the Treasurer are reported to the Comptroller, and, on his order, 
paid into the Treasury—school moneys, as well as others. The 
Treasurer is keeper of the funds of the State; the Comptroller, the 
auditor of all the funds of the State. No school moneys could be 
reached by any bill due for school purposes, until the whole amount 
for a given year is reported to this office by the Comptroller, for ap- 
portionm ui. Wah the collect on of the school moneys, and their 
handling until such report is made to this office, the Superintendent 
has nothing to do. The general responsibility over the entire 
School Fund—that which is permanent, and that which is for an- 
nual distribution—is vested in the Board of State School Fund 
Commissioners, composed of the Governor, Secretary of State, 
Comptroli-r, Vreasurer and Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
My financial responsibility, sufficient in all respects, was, therefore, 
individually limited to the faithful disbursement, according to law, of 
all the school moneys apportioned. I had nothing to do with any 
others, save as a member of the State Board. The Code and re- 
vir ed law required separate accounts kept of all school moneys in 
the Revenue Department of the State. The new law allowed no 
pa met of these moneys for any other than school purposes, and 
then only on the approval of the Superintendent of Public Instruc- 
tion. I decided, therefore, that I could best discharge the responsi- 
bility of faithful disbursement resting upon me, by the following 
method: 
I. Having such facts furnished the office in reports required by 
law as would show compliance with its conditions.
-P-A-G-E-121
121 
II. Such records of the facts as would constitute legal ground 
for my approval of the disbursements. 
TIL. Letting the funds remain in the custody of the Treasurer 
after announced to me for apportionment as they have been before 
that announcement, and as all other State moneys are, he being 
their bonded keeper; thus, also, relieving the State of the special 
embarrassment in the depressed condition of its finances of paying 
over any large sum at once.* 
IV. Adopting a method of payments by which the Comptroller: 
would not only have cognizance of the issue of school moneys in 
bulk, some thousands or hundreds of thousands, as the whole amount 
might be, but have certified statements of each issue in detail, show: 
ing separately what was for salaries, what was for schools, and these 
subdivided into colored and white, for each civil district in the State. 
V. Doing this by preparing forms for duplicate vouchers, one of 
which should remain in my files, and the other go to the Comp- 
troller, and authorize his warrant on the Treasury ;. thus carrying 
each separate payment, whether for salary or for schools, through 
the three offices—this, the Comptroller’s and the Treasurer’s: so 
that nothing in my power should be omitted to secure accurate and 
faithful disbursement. This method gave the Treasurer and Comp- 
troller more labor, but they have not complained. 
VI. Prescribing for County Superintendents, forms for their office 
which, first, should correspond with the central office methods and 
simplify their accounts; and, second, enable any one in their coun- 
ties, who desired, to get a clear view of the condition of the county 
school finances; and render it possible for their annual settlement to 
be made by the Executive School Board of the county, who should 
examine their accounts, receipts and: expenditures, and compare 
their vouchers with their accounts of expenditures, and send a certi- 
fied copy to this office. [See Appendix, Ff.] 
  * Extract from Report of Jannary 26, 1869: “You have observed in the office that, in dis- 
bursing the school moneys, none are taken into my personal care, though I'am under bonds 
tothe amount of one hundred thousand dollars, and such a course is admissable by law. In- 
stead of this, I have desired the Treasurer to act as custodian of the school moneys, as he is 
of the funds of the State in general, and adopted a method of business calculated at once, 
“Ist. Fully to meet my responsibility to see that every dollar of school money is disbursed 
ascording to law. 
“2d. To avoid its being scattered in the counties, without securing the estvblishment of 
schools. On this point I received special caution from finding in the hands of County Trustees 
large sums of the old fund. Various suits are now pending for the recovery of these moneys. 
“3d. So, also, as fo trouble as little as possible the over-burthened Treasury, by allowing 
the money to remain in the control of the Treasurer until required in payment for services 
rendered.” ~
-P-A-G-E-122
122 
It seemed to me this method of separating school money trans- 
actions from all others, the officers being Superintendents for the 
purpose of doing this special work well, the whole supervision, State 
and county, being held to a strict accountability, unmixed and un- 
relieved by other officers, and carrying the whole, at the Capitol, 
upon the books of the financial officers of the State, as well as all 
for each county upon the books of the Superintendent in the county, 
and thus bringing his entire aceounts under the inspection and ap- 
proval of three men chosen from the whole body of Directors in the 
district, left no chance for mistake or fraud which it was possible to 
provide against. The result is before the State. Deficiencies are 
occurring in various directions in the collection of the State revenue, 
But so far no Superintendent is reported deficient in the settlements 
coming into my hands. Some settlements have been delayed out 
of time; and, should any one be deficient in the settlements which 
remain to be made, the evidence will be clear and indisputable, and 
the proper steps for prosecution can be taken at once; and, if 
County Court Clerks have faithfully guarded the bonds, there can- 
not be a cent lost. 
Manifcstly it is not possible to mix these duties up with others ; 
to put these duties into the hands of men who have been elected to 
their position for other and entirely different purposes, and at the 
same time to hold them thus before the public to an accountability 
so clearly and sharply defined. 
No one now, no matter how much a stranger, can go to the 
office of a County Superintendent, where the books have been kept 
in accordance with instructions, or come to this office, and look at 
the records of any county as kept here, and fail to understand thom, 
or to detect whatever may be wrong, if there should be anything. 
Complaints about Moneys.—Notwithstanding the excellencies 
of the methods by which moneys have been handled, delays have 
occurred, Many have supposed these delays were all due to the 
Superintendents of schools, whereas the delays are not due to them ; 
but they are to be credited with the fact that there have been any 
schools organized, or any money paid out for schools. 
They have pushed the taking of the scholasti¢ population, and 
reported it, on which the apportionment of money is made; they 
have pushed the schools into operation, and reported them for pay- 
ment, and urgently and emphatically demanded promptness. Not 
a cent for the districts has come into my hands. Every apportion-
-P-A-G-E-123
123 
ment made has been reported most promptly to the counties and the 
public generally. But there have been grounds for complaint in 
regard to finances, although the supervision is in no way responsible.* 
I. The non-settlement of the obligations of the State, in reference 
to the permanent School Fund, in violation of all constitutional ob- 
ligations, has deprived the schools of its annual benefits. No con- 
dition of facts could justify this non-action, and the consequent 
harm to the schools of the State. 
II. The moneys paid into the Treasury, for school purposes, have 
been used to pay railroad interest and other State expenses, as they 
became due. But this is only the continuance of a time out-of-mind 
practice. It was no new thing. 
III. No separate accounts are kept of school and general revenue. 
This, also, is only a continuance of the old form of account. In- 
deed, the same most competent and laborious accountant, who kept 
the books before the war, keeps them just the same now. 
IV. The lack of money to pay the above warrants when issued is” 
the necessary result of the overwhelming weight thrown upon the 
Treasury, in carrying the railroads of the State, Finally, these 
have been found so vast—railroads have, so many of them, proved

delinquent, that the State has come to neglect the responsibility, 
and let the interest pass unpaid. 
The effort to carry a debt so out of proportion to the financial 
strength of the State, and neglect the education of the children, 
has failed. 
The responsibility does not rest exclusively on any one individual 
or class; nor is it limited to any one year of the State organization. 
It has grown with the growth of State methods of business, and 
State ideas and practices. The fault is general, and the present 
responsibility is, that there has not been sufficient concentration of 
wise thought and determination to remove the general fault inher- 
ited from the past. The school system has labored under it, as 
under a night-mare. The evils that have been due it have been 
charged upon the school system, asif the medical counsel doing all 
in the power of medical skill to overcome the ravages of disease, 
and heal the patient, is to be charged with the evils of the disease ! 
This Report can hardly be glanced at, either in the main body or 
in the Appendix, without a sight of the struggle of the system, 
especially the supervision, with the evil condition of our finances. 
The people pay the taxes for the support of schools; their chil- 
dren need the schools; as the free schools have opened and ad- 
vanced in improvement, as they should, in their midst, fathers and 
mothers have found them the best to which they have sent. The 
teachers’ services are rendered, and the parents demand the money 
back for payment of these services for their children. It is natural 
and right that they should be sensitive about any delay. But the 
source and root cf the difficulty should be reached. No charging 
of the responsibility where it docs not belong will accomplish any 
good; that only serves to turn the corrective efforts from the true 
source of the evil. Some would abolish the supervision, as a remedy; 
but this would be striking down the special agency by which every- 
thing has been forwarded to the present results—taking out the 
heart of the man to cure the lack of vigor in the circulation of the 
blood. .Unfortunately, some have made these difficulties the subject 
- of partisan rancor. They lie too near the State vitals to be put in 
such peril. No question of State interest demands a treatment 
more completely removed from every personal or partisan feeling, 
or requires a more disinterested or far-seeing statesmanship in its 
consideration. The basis of opinion must be fact, truth; not con- 
jecture ; not ill-considered theory or ill temper.
-P-A-G-E-125
125 
What Should Have Been, Financially.—When this office 
opened, the people had paid one year’s tax, and had nearly finished 
paying another year’s tax, to the State, for school purposes. They 
should have had the scholastic population reported here; the or- 
ganization should have been complete, as we have seen, and my first 
financial act should have been the announcement of an apportion- 
ment. When the scholastic population was secured, in August, 
nearly a year afterwards, the collections from 1866 and 1867 should 
have been included. When the collections for 1867 were reported 
to the office, those for 1868 had been made, and should have been 
included. Each district should have had, after this system com- 
menced organization, the benefit of the State aid one year earlier 
jn each instance—that is, before this, not only the collections from 
1866 and 1867 should have been paid out where schools have been 
taught, but the collections from 1868, also. The interest on the 
permanent School Fund, [See ‘Appendix, p. XX1L,| should have 
annually been paid over, without diminution or perversion, for the 
benefit of free schools. Whatever has in any way occurred to the 
fund, in the catastrophes of the past ten years, it appears to me, 
the State is holden, as Trustee, for the entire amount, the: princi- 
pal never to be diminished, and the interest to be, annually, faith- 
fully disbursed. This interest should have been included and paid 
in each of the apportionments already made. There should also 
have been income from escheated lands, and lands sold at tax sales. 
What Has Been, Financially.—1. No benefit has been re- 
ceived by the schools from the permanent fund. The fund is in an 
unsettled condition. 
2. Little or no benefit has been received from escheated lands bid 
in from tax sales, in the name of the Superintendent of Public In- 
struction. 
38. The collections from taxes, for scheols, amounting to $178,- 
075.34, for the year 1806, have been apportioned; and we com- 
menced drawing upon them in August, 1868, two years after the 
assessment, 
4. The collections for schools, amounting to $472,331.86, for the 
year 1867, have been apportioned; and _we commenced drawing 
upon them in February, 1869, somewhat less than two years after 
the assessment. 
In the case of the general revenue, it will be noticed, the assess- 
ment occurs, the collection follows, and as soon as a dollar is col-
-P-A-G-E-126
126 
lected, it can be paid out for any bill due against the State. The 
difference between assessment and use of the money is hardly more 
months, than the difference in time between assessment and use of 
school moneys is years. This is too great a violation of decent 
financial policy to need comment. The prompt use of the general 
revenue, for the objects for which it is collected, is just and rght; 
the wrong is in the handling of collections for school purposes. 
Again, there is great loss to the State, and injury to the School 
Fund, by connecting the sale of lands, for tax, with the School 
Fund. Those parcels redeemed are bid in for the State, in the name 
of the Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
The law proposes to increase the School Fund, but operates very 
differently. These tax sales are not understood to give good titles. 
So common a proceeding should be too well understood to need 
statement here; yet, I have found it so far from being compre- 
hended, and the evil is so great, that I cannot, in justice, omit 
reference to it. Each parcel of land entered on the tax duplicate, 
on which the tax is not paid at the specified date, goes tosale. The 
fees of the Clerk, Printer and Collector, are four dollars on each 
parcel. The fees of all that are redeemed, or go into private hands, 
are paid by the parties redeeming or buying. But the fees of all 
that are bought in for the State, in the name of the Superintendent 
of Public Instruction, are paid by the Comptroller from the School 
Fund. These fees reach a large amount, and, together with the 
taxes lost to the State, make an alarming showing. Hon. George 
W. Blackburn, Comptroller of the State, has furnished me the 
following figures, from his books, for Shelby County, for the year 
1867: 
Tax on property sold,     
     $57,416 80 Collectors’ tees on same, 8,053 00 
Printer’s fees, 4,579 50 
Clerks’ fees,. 4.579 50 
Releases by t 14,174 41 
$83,803 21 
With such a system of revenue, it is difficult to calculate with 
any certainty upon the income of the State. The point of interest 
here in connection with the school finances does not consist merely 
in the loss of so much of the tax levied by sales and by releases, 
but in the additional consideration that all of the fees are paid out 
of the school moneys. The sale, as it is said, being for the benefit of 
schools, they were expected to pay the fees. The result, moreover,
-P-A-G-E-127
127 
is not only great loss to the general and the school revenue, but 
room is opened for frauds throughout the State. 
As I entered upon my duties, reports began to’ come to me of 
lands here and there sold’as above, and held in the name of the 
Superintendent of Public Instruction, in-some instances re-entered 
for tax and re-sold year by year, and in others, though held in that 
title, occupied and successfully cultivated. No exact record of them - 
had been so kept as to be readily accessible. No one looked to the 
State interest in them. In trying to meet my responsibilities in 
that direction, I found on further investigation the time within 
which redemption could be effected had been extended, and that the 
rate of interest for redeeming lands from the State had been so re- 
duced that, according to the records examined, men of wealth found 
it more convenient to let these lands go to sale, and redeem them 
from the State, and pay the per cent. required on the amount of 
their taxes, than to loan money at 14 per cent. a month and 
pay their taxes. Several amendatory provisions were enacted by 
the Legislature, with a view to the removal of these large losses. 
Lack of clerical aid has prevented my doing more than getting a 
sufficient view of the facts to know that the State and honest tax- 
payers have a large interest in this direction, which should be pro- 
tected. Judge John M. Lea has given the subject careful considera- 
tion, and I take the liberty to refer to him, as one who is seeking 
to apply the proper corrective to these evils. 
School Lands.—These large donations to the State in trust for 
learning, it is believed by some, have, in some instances, been ille- 
gally sold, The case of a sale in Ducktown has been reviewed by 
the higher courts, and the lands restored to the use of schools. The — 
records of these sales it has been my purpose to examine. I have 
made many inquiries upon the subject, but, for lack of clerical aid, 
have been unable to prosecute the subject as it demands. My im- 
pressions, however, had become so strong that, if I had had assist- 
ance in my office which further attention required, I should have 
re-opened the question in the courts. / 
Other Educational Funds.—It is well known this State has 
divided educational funds in three directions: First, for common 
schools; second, for academies; third, for universities. I have ex- 
amined the subject sufficiently to receive the impression that the 
treatment of these funds by the State should be revised; indeed,
-P-A-G-E-128
128 
that it will be revised before public sentiment and titles to the land 
sold are fully and finally settled. . 
The Permanent School Fund.—The condition of this fun 
should receive an early and exhaustive examination; its exact 
amount be ascertained and conclusively settled, and prompt pro- 
vision be made for meeting the State’s obligation to pay over its 
annual interest for the support of common schools. [See Appen- 
dix, He.—for reports of Committees on the subject, to the last 
Legislature. ] 
Effectual preventives of the delays in apportioning and paying 
out the school money, for annual distribution, can, it has seemed to 
me, be readiy applied. If the system of tax sales and releases be 
remedied, and the school fund be relieved of all embarrassments in 
that quarter, much will be accomplished. But the evil of waiting 
till the taxes are not only collected, but all tax collectors have 
settled, should also be removed. The school revenue should be 
available for use the same year it is collected. The people should 
have the benefit of it as promptly as possible, after they have paid 
it over to the State. On solicitation, I furnished the last Legisla- 
ture the following memorandum of an act which would, in my 
opinion, meet the most serious difficulties now encountered, and give 
universal relief and satisfaction in this particular. 
Be it enacted, That hereafter, the scholastic population shall be taken by the re- 
spective Clerks of Districts, between the first and third Mondays of March, in each 
and every year, and be reported to the State Superinteudent, by the County Su- 
perintendents of Public Instruction, on or before the first day of May, in each 
year; and that the County Court Cierk and Tax Collector of each county. shall 
keep in their offices a separate account of the school taxes, and report the same to 
the Comptrolier separately, who shall, on or before the first day in June, in each 
year, report to the State Superintendent the amount of such taxes, less ten per 
cent., together with the accrued interest from the State Scuvol Fund, to that date, 
which amount of school taxes, and interest of School Fund, the State Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction shall apportion pro rata, of the schola-tie population 
to the severa) counties, and announce the same to the County Superintendents, by 
the first day of July in each year; and the scholastié year shail hereafter begin on 
that day; Provided, that any incorporated town, which shall fail to make a return of 
the schulastic population, as required by this Act, shall not be entitled to receive 
any poriion of the school funds for the current year. 
The measure failed to pass. The experience and observation 
added since hardly sugges: any revision of the leading ideas. The 
object of allowing the deduction of a per cent. from the face of the 
tax duplicate for school purposes, is the fact that sucl.a deficit dues
-P-A-G-E-129
129 
actually occur in the collection of the taxes. The apportionment 
made as above, would enable every district to know what it might 
expect from the State, before its schools opened in the summer or 
fall; and by the time the schools closed, the money would be col- 
lected and ready to be drawn, and paid to teachers. The present 
delays and embarrassments would not be known. The item of the 
beginning and end of the school year, included in the above memo- 
randum is an interesting one. The State embraces so diverse in- 
dustrial interests; its sowing, and planting, and gathering seasons 
differ so greatly in the different sections of the State, that it is diffi- 
cult, and perhaps impossible, exactly to suit all. The Ist of July 
has been, however, more generally recommended in answer to my in- 
quiries upon the subject, than any other date, This, it might also. 
be added, would afford ample time to close reports, and prepare 
them for. the time now fixed for the assembling of the Legislature: 
County Supervision.—A recent national association of educa- 
tors expressed the prevailing educational idea of supervision by the 
following resolution: , 
“ Resolved, That State, County and City Superintendents are indispensable to 
any system of public instruction.” 
This conclusion has not been reached by a theoretical jump. 
Philosophy confirms its wisdom, but the hardest and most costly 
experience alone has sufficed to secure its adoption. One of the 
original colonies enacted that the management of the schools should 
be a part of the duty of “ye chosen men for managing the pru- 
dential affairs.” “* Every grammar schoolmaster was to be approved 
by the minister of the town.”’ The duties of “ye chosen men” re- 
quired them to compel the attendance of all the children upon the — 
schools; they were to visit all the schools, and supervise their regula- 
tions, and the discipline and “the proficiency’ of the pupils, and they 
were to “see to the morals” of the teachers. Out of this germ of 
local supervision, unpaid and limited, has grown the systematic, 
paid, professional, educational supervision that is now the power 
which is compelling from every civilized nation commendation of 
American schools. 
City Supervision.—The concentration of population in cities so 
increases the conditions which favor the production of vice and 
crime that intelligent citizens, anxious to advance the value of their 
property and preserve the public virtue, have vigorously sought the
-P-A-G-E-130
180 
         
   most efficient methods of improving schools and assuring universa: 
culture. Supervision by a practical, skillful educator they hav 
almost universally adopted as an essential means of success. Ne 
York City has an able Superintendent, who is furnished five assist 
ants and a clerk. 
Supervision is being still further perfected in some cities, by re- 
quiring each principal of a school to supervise the subordinate 
departments in his school, and impart to them, if possible, through 
their teachers, his own skillin teaching and discipline. City Super- 
intendents are paid from one thousand to five thousand dollars per 
annum. But, however great the expenditure, its economy is un- 
questioned. In Ohio and other States, where graded systems of 
schools have attained great perfection, even each smaller city or 
village, like Greeneville, Knoxville, Chattanooga, etc., has a Super- 
intendent of schools, who devotes his entire time to their improve- 
‘ment. - They increase their educational expenses, and reduce their 
outlay for police. Knoxville expends $7,000a year for police, and 
nothing for public schools, by municipal action. This increase of 
taxes on account of crime will ere long wake up any city or village to 
the necessity and cheapness of free school education of the most per- 
fect character. But, when the supervision in the organization of a 
-system of schools is allowed to come up out of this necessity, instead 
of being adopted from a correct and wise understanding of its uses 
and benefits, it is generally limited to the city, and the country 
schools are left to halt and stumble, suffering from poor houses, 
poor teaching—a scandal to the community—putting the youth of 
the rural districts to a great disadvantage in the struggle of life, 
until supervision in some form comes to the country schools to devise 
-and enforce their advancement. Ohio, honored by the number and 
-excellence of her town schools under Superintendents, is equally 
disgraced by the deplorable condition of her country district schools, 
where there is no adequate supervision. The expense of a complete 
system of supervision over all the schools is increased, but the 
country schools are left to take their chances, while the town schools 
get the exclusive benefit. Her educators, appreciating” the evils 
from which the rural population is suffering, are rousing themselves, 
‘the people, and their Legislators, to the adoption of county super- 
‘vision. 
New York—After trying various plans, has adopted assembly 
district superintendence, with general approval,
-P-A-G-E-131
. 181 
Arkansas—Is organizing schools with Congressional district 
supervision. But the favorite and most successful form of inter- 
mediate or local superintendence is county supervision. Few topics 
are more generally discussed in recent reports on education. 
Ohio.—Hon. E. E. White, when Commissioner of Schools for 
Ohio, strongly urged county supervision, and says: 
“A careful inquiry into the practical workings of the county supervision in 
different States shows that whatever lack of efficiency it has exhibited may be 
traced directly to incompetent officers, and that one of the prime sources of this mis- 
chief is political influence. Wherever-the office has been made the foot-ball of party 
organizations and cliques, there its usefulness has been seriously impaired. What 
is needed is not simply the supervisory office, but the office so created as to guard it 
effectually from unqualified aspirants.” 
Massachusetts.—Hon. J. White, Secretary of the Board of . 
’ Education for Massachusetts, writes: 
“Next to the employment of able and skillful teachers, the exercise of an intelli- 
gent and careful superintendence, is the most important instrumentality in the 
successful management of onr schovls. It is no less true here than in any other 
enterprise which gives employment to any considerable number of persona, working 
separately, yet towards the production of the same result, that the highest degree 
of success in the result will largely depend on the skill and ability of the oversight 
employed.” 
Indiana.—An Indiana educational writer observes: 
* “There is no officer under our school law upon whom depends so much the wel- 
fare of the great mass of our public schools, and there is no officer 80 poorly paid, 
The meager pittance of three dollars per day will hardly pay his necessary travel- 
ing expenses, and few competent men can be found who are willing to devote 
themselves to this work, as a labor of love. The result is that either various sub- 
terfuges are resorted to, and oftentimes other branches of business are tacked on 
to eke out a salary, or else the schools are entirely neglected. A supervisor, who 
will give his undivided attention to the schools, while they are in session, is needed 
in every county in the State. There is more’reason for such an officer for our 
tural districts than for our cities and towns; and it is ag inconsistent to attempt to 
run a machine shop, employing 9, hundred laborers, without a foreman, as to expect 
uniformity and efficiency in the work of a hundred different schools, without the 
direction and control of a competent Superintendent. Our Legislature has made it 
possible to carry on @ free school in every district in the State for ten months in the 
year, if desired, and itis certainly wise to employ a responsible agent in every 
county to systemize the work, and secure a judicious expenditure of the school 
fund.” 
Michigan—Triumphing in her higher departments of public edu- 
cation before older States, struggled long to bring her country 
schools up to the standard without County Superintendents. An 
enlightened public sentiment at last forced its adoption. The 
following year the State Superintendent, Hon. O. Hosford, said:
-P-A-G-E-132
182 
“Doubts are entertained by many with regard to the success of the ¢. 
County Superintendency. It was an experiment in this State, yet not ar 
ment new and unheard of, but one whose success was confidently predict 4 
friends, from its good results in other States, and goes on at length to detail it 
be. efits.” 
Pennsylvania.—t{n Pennsylvania, where county supe: "~ - 
early adopted, the State Superintendent, Hon. J. P. Wick: 
his Report for 1868, declares: “The county superinten |

workings would be willing to see the act establishing il 
No statement is needed to make known the good it has : 
fruits speak for it. It has been called, and with good 1 
right arm of the system.” 
Ilinois.—Hon. Newton Bateman, Superintendent of Instruc**-~ 
for Illinois, in one of his earlier Reports said: ‘The great wan: 
our school system, as such, is supervision.”’ In his Report for 1&v., 
he traces the progress and growth of this county supervision in use- 
fulness and adds: 
“Jn 1867, the compensation of County Superintendents of Schools was increased. 
from three to five dollars a day, for services actually rendered. The good effect of 
this action of the last General Assembly is shown, in part, by the statistics of work 
avid progress, elsewhere given in this Report. But the full extent and value of 
that measure cannot be exhibited in statistical form. It has given a prodigious im- 
pulse to the whole line of Common School forcesinthe State. It has enabled many 
able and efficient Superintendents, for the first time, to bestow their whole time and 
energies upon the duties committed to them, and the results have been in the 
highest degree encouraging. More and better institutes have been held in the 
State, and more and better work has been done in all the departments of the school 
system, than in any preceding two years of our free school history. Thisis abun- 
dantly shown by the preceding summaries of results. ‘Ihe general tone of public 
sentiment and feeling, in respect to education, has been vitalized and strengthened 
to an unwonted degree. ‘While this is partly due to other causes, the main cause is, 
without question, the vastly increased vigor and power of the County Superin- 
tendency—the reduplication of time, and effort, and labor, which the wise liberality 
of the last Legislature brought into the field. The uplifting and renovating energy 
of the Superiutendency, since the passage of the act referred to, has been manifest 
in every county, without exception, whose Superintendent is qualified by education, 
experience and character, for the duties of the position.” . 
Attention should also here be called to the pertinent testimony 
upon this point, in the letters from several States, quoted on pp. 73 
to 78, : 
Manner of Selecting County Superintendents.—In Penn- 
sylvania, they are elected as the law provides for their election in 
Tennessee, in 1870, by the Directors of the civil districts of the
-P-A-G-E-133
4 
188 
county. In Michigan and Wisconsin, they are elected by popular 
vote of the people of the county. 
County Supervision in Tennessee.—On page 9, and incident- 
ally elsewhere in this Report, the absolute necessity of the County 
- Supervision, in organizing the free schools of the State, is apparent. 
The oft-repeated remark of the Chiéf Commissioner of Popular Edu- 
cation in Holland,—‘‘Take care how you choose your Inspectors; 
they are men whom you ought to look for with a lantern in your 
hand,”—I could not forget, as I looked’ for men to make known.the 
system, and put it in operation in the counties. On their repre- 
sentation, the people were to approve or disapprove of the system. 
An objection was early raised, and persistently urged against them, 
most surprising and singular among American citizens, viz: that 
they were not natives of the State. Professional skillin any depart- 
ment—law, theology, medicine, engineering, and especially in edu- 
cation—is usually so earnestly sought, without reference to nativity, 
but solely in regard to its excellence, that this objection was all the 
more surprising. Teachers and Superintendents are drawn from the 
uttermost parts of the country. Wisconsin goes to Connecticut for 
aman to become chief of her educational system, and even Con- 
necticut goes to Massachusetts for a Secretary of its Board of Edu- 
cation. But, in looking at the facts, the absurdity of the objection 
appears, if possible, more striking. The frequent changes that have 
occurred have left the list the same no great length of time. At 
the date, however, when my attention was called to the fact that 
the selection of these gentlemen was an offense, it was found that 
sixty-three out of the eighty-four were natives of the State and 
vicinity, and that, of the twenty-one against whom the offense could 
be charged, of not having been’born in Tennessee, sixteen of them 
had the advantage of college or professional education, or of special 
experience as teachers, and that all had practical knowledge of es- 
tablised and successful school systems. Another similarly serious 
charge, which was new to me, as holding against the fitness of a 
person for educational service, was, that many of the Superintend- 
ents were clergymen. Instead of recognizing this as an unfitness, 
T could but congratulate the friends of education that, in addition 
to good ability and good practical sense, and willingness to labor for 
the public good, out of the sixty-three born in the State or the vi- 
cinity, forty-two were known to be either graduates of colleges or of 
professional schools of medicine, law or theology, or experienced
-P-A-G-E-134
134 
teachers. Among the remaining twenty-one, it is believed, though 
not known, that others have enjoyed similar advantages; and all 
had a willingness to undertake a task at present so laborious, with a 
most inadequate compensation. 
Compensation of County Superintendents.—None could be 
paid until the first apportionment of school moneys was made, Au- 
gust 3d, 1868, or nearly. a year after their services commenced. In 
a Report, January 26th, I observed: 
“Too much cannot be said in praise of the good faith and confidence in the State, 
and self-sacrifice of Superintendents and teachers, who have labored, some of them 
at great personal inconvenience, others at considerable expense, for the public wel- 
fare, amid the most discouraging misrepresentation and opposition, without a far- 
thing of compensation from the State. When has our Staie carried on so far, so 
gréat an enterprise, simply on faith? 
“The law leaves a discretion with regard to the salary of the County Superin- 
tendenta, with the State Board of School Fund Commissioners. As Secretary of 
that Board, I may say, that they endeavored to discharge this delicate responsibility 
so, as nearly as possible, to do exact justice, and to subserve best the public in- 
terest. 
~The name of each county and its Superintendent, andthe number of its scholastic 
population, together with all suggestions that had been received from Directors 
and others, of views in regard to what the pay of each County Superintendent 
should be,.were before them. The diversity of amounts mentioned was great, 
varying from ten dollars to two thousand per annum. It was recollected that a 
conviction had been expressed in the passage of the original bill by the Legisla- 
ture, that their salaries would likely average five hundred dollars per year, which 
was below the amount generally paid elsewhere; even Maryland paying in her 
smallest county, according to the Report of 1866, not less than $700, and, on an 
average, over $950; while Pennsyslvania expends, in paying County Superintend- 
ents, $60,000 annually, 
“ But the Board, on trying to fix a uniform salary, saw that the conditions on 
which a salary should depend were exceedingly various, and did not exactly agree 
in any two counties, and it was concluded that the same amount of pay to each 
Superintendent would operate exceeding unjustly. The question was then raised 
of regulating the salary according to the scholastic population. This was appa- 
rently more reasonable, but it was observed that some of the counties of smaller 
scholastic population were larger in territory, and the same school work would re- 
quire much more time and travel, and that a salary, fixed according to scholastic 
population, would work other inequalities and hardships. 
“After considerable discussion of other propositions, it was 
“Resolved, That in fizing the salaries of the County Superintendents of Public 
Instruction, as required by law, this Board, following the rule of the law of the 
State in respect to the compensation of other public services, do hereby fix the 
salary of said Superintendents at the rate of four dollars per diem for the time 
actually spent in the discharge of their official duties for the first six months, the 
same to be certified as correct by the Executive Board of the county. 
“You notice this is not ona gold but currency basis. The State Board attempted
-P-A-G-E-135
  135 
only to fix the amount per diem, and left the Executive Board.of the county to pass 
upon the correctness-and justness of the days’ services.* 
“The Executive Board of the County, you remember, are elected by the Clerks 
of the District School Boards, from their own number, and are likely to be among 
the most intelligent and competent men in the county. The State Board has before 
it a comprehensive view of the field, and regulates the per diem. 
“An able County Board, familiar with the affairs of the county, and in full’ sym- 
pathy with its interests, revises and approves the Superintendent’s account. Sinoe 
this method was adopted by the Board, the satisfaction expressed from various’ 
quarters of the State, has been greater than I had expected to result from any 
possible solution of this difficult question. 
This action of the State Board provided a rule only for their pay 
the first six months. There was no meeting of that board for fur- 
ther action until May, 1869; consequently payment for services 
after the six months waited till that meeting, when the board voted 
that three dollars per day should be the amount allowed. 
This applies until March, 1870, when the Superintendents are to 
be elected by the directors of the respective counties, and the pay 
to be determined by them. They have been paid with the above 
delays for each six months, as required by law, when their bills 
have been presented, reckoning from the time in which supervision 
was commenced in the county, ‘This settles with some up to date, 
while it leaves others soon to bring in their accounts for another six 
months. Had the money been in the Treasury, it was my purpose

to require the settlements to be made so as to begin and end with 
the fiscal year of the State. 
_ The deduction of their salaries also from the amount due to the coun- 
ties I have omitted until the State was prepared to come nearer meet- 
ing its obligations. When the State is no longer a year or two years 
behind with the payments to the school fund for distribution, but pays 
all its school obligations when due, these salaries should be annually 
deducted from the amount for apportionment. Had the taxes for 
1868 been reported as I hoped, I should have closed these accounts. 
A still further reason for the delay of this settlement is the fact 
that there are considerable amounts forfeited by different districts 
on account of non-compliance with the law. This forfeiture I have 
not thought it just at present to enter upon the books, and conclude; 
because many districts have been making special exertions to com- 
ply, of late, and secure the advantage of the money under section 
17, Act of March 14, 1868, by which the State Superintendent may, 
before the complete organization of the system of free schools in 
the State, recoynize acts as valid if performed in accordance with 
the spirit of the law, though not at the date required. The books 
and vouchers of the office show in detail the condition of all these 
accounts, the summary of which appears in the Appendix. 
Change of County Superintendents—An amendment to the 
law gives the State Superintendent authority to withhold or with- 
draw the commission for incompetency of the County Superintendents 
to take the candidate’s oath, or to discharge the duties of said office 
in any respect. But I have not exercised the authority so vested. 
The repeal of the entire section is desirable. The frequent change 
of these officers is exceedingly injurious to the public welfare. 
None, however unaccustomed to school affairs, can follow this Re- 
port thus far without abundant reason to know that school manage- 
ment is essentially professional. Unskilled hands run great risk in 
undertaking it. When skill has been acquired, certainly the com- 
munity should not hastily or capriciously be deprived of it. 
Rev. Dr. Ryerson, of Ontario, Canada, already quoted, an able, 
candid and disinterested witness, makes the following weighty ob- 
servations upon the frequent changes in our American system, 
which, although it dwells more upon the selection of the State officer, 
yet it applies with proportionate force to the changes of the County 
Superintendent, as he observes at the close: 
‘A fruitful cause of inefficiency in the American systems of popular instruction
-P-A-G-E-137
187 
appears to me to be the mode of appointing the administrators of their school sys- 
tems, and their tenure of office. In all the neighboring States, this mode of ap- 
pointing their State Superintendents has been by popular universal suffrage vote, 
and for a period not exceediug three years, and in some instances, not exceeding 
two years; in the election of their County or Town Superintendents, the seme 
system hag been pursued. In New York and Pennsylvania, a beneficial change 
has been introduced, in regard to the appointment of their State Superintendents— 
in the former, the State Superintendents being appointed by the joint ballot of the 
Senate and House of Representatives, and in the latter by the Executive, with the 
advice of the Senate; but the teuure of office in both States is for three years, as it 
is in the State of Ohio, where the State Commissioner of Common Schools is still 
elected by universal suffrage throughout the State. In looking at the school history 
of these States, for the last twenty years, there are very few. if any, instances of 
any one of these highest educational officers continuing in office more than three 
years atatime. There is no department of civil government in which careful 
preparation, varied study and observation, and independent and uniform action, 
are so important to success and efficiency, as in founding and developing a system 
of public instruction, which it is utterly impossible to do where no one placed at 
the head of the system has time or opportunity to establish and bring into effective 
operation any one branch of it, School legislation, therefore, with our American 
neighbors, is as unsettled now as it was at the beginning of the last twenty years, 
and more; and their schools, (except in cities and towns,) are less improved than 
their country in every other respect. They seem to forget that the representative 
functions of government—the power to exercise which is based on popular elee- 
tion—relate chiefly to the making of laws and the imposition of taxes; but that the 
administration of law should be free from the influences of popular passion, and 
be based on immutable maxims of justice and patriotism, Our American friends 
appear to me to suffer equally, if not more, ‘in their educational interests, from their 
love of rotation of office and frequent popular election to it, in respect to their 
County and Town Superintendents of Schools. Their system appears to me to be 
inconsistent, as a general rule, with the selection,of competent Superintendents by 
the parties by whom they are elected or opposed, and to whom such Superintendents 
are looking for votes at an approaching election. Under the operations of such a 
system, it appears to me, there must often be as much electioneering as school su- 
perintendence or administration; that the latter will often be warped to advance 
the former, or, as is expressed in an American Report, that there will be much 
‘log-rolling or pipe-laying,’ to secure the universal suffrage of election or re-election 
to the office, at the expense of the advancement of the schools,” 
The Election of County Superintendents, as now provided 
by Jaw, will occur “on the first Monday of March, 1870, except in 
those counties where the election of 1868 was holden in time and 
manner to be recognized as legal. The Directors of the civil dis- 
tricts meet in convention on that day, and elect, viva voce, by a ma- 
jority of the whole number of Directors present.” They determine 
the annual amount of compensation for the Superintendent. He is 
to serve three years. The School Directors, of all persons in the 
county, are likely to be thoughtful of educational interests, and care-
-P-A-G-E-138
188 
ful to elect no one unfit for the place. Indeed, the law is specific 
in its requirements; he shall be ‘a person of skill and acquirements 
in the art of teaching.” This corresponds more nearly to the 
manner of electing City Superintendents by the City Boards of Edu- 
cation. 
The election of School Directors, being separate from political 
elections, is less likely to be shaped by partisan feeling, and their 
election of a Superintendent is still another remove from those un- 
happy contests. 
The universal extension of intelligence, and appreciation of edu- 
cation, can afford the only assurance of a wise result. 
Appreciation of the Duties of County Superintendents.—A 
considerate educator cannot fail. often to be surprised by the appre- 
ciation he here and there finds of the duties of these officers. What 
can be thought of that condition of public sentiment, in which a speaker 
should think it popular to attack the only man in the county devoted 
to the education of the young, universally, solely because this is what 
his duties required, and he tries to discharge them faithfully? What 
interest in any county is greater than the training of the young? 
All other interests center in it, and are wrapped up by it. If it is 
thought proper to put half a dozen other and subordinate interests in 
a county, each, separately, in charge of an officer, and pay him for his 
services, what shall we say of the proposition not to put the interest 
of the education of the young, so inclusive of all others, in the care of 
anybody in particular?. Better, by far, dispense with any other one 
of the county officers than with that one who supervises the culture 
of the youth. All other officers might discharge their functions, 
and the community go hack to barbarism; but education cannot do 
its work efficiently without the progress of the people in civilization 
and its virtues. Some other territorial unit—that of Senatorial, or 
Judicial, or Congressional District—might be mentioned for local 
supervision. But no other territorial unit in the State is so satis- 
factory to the traditions of the people. County spirit and pride are 
strong. Besides, the nature of the County Superintendents’ duties 
is such, that they can be far better performed within the limits of a 
county. The counties are generally large. Postal communication 
is imperfect. I have been told of counties in which a letter is three 
weeks going in due course from a post-office in the county to another 
in the same county; and intelligence is so limited that greater mail 
facilities would not pay. If the State proposes, therefore, that
-P-A-G-E-139
139 
schools shall go into these regions, it must devise an agency ade- 
quate to the end. What is better than putting one man skilled in 
the art of teaching, of large common sense and hearty zeal for the 
public good, in each county, for this purpose? Look at his duties: 
I. He must examine teachers. 
II. He must see that the scholastic census is taken. It would 
seem that the securing of a dollar and fifteen cents from the State 
for school purposes, for each child of school age, would be sufficient 
motive to render the discharge of this duty doubly sure by the 
people. But what are the facts, after all that has been said from 
this office, and repeated by the County Superintendents? Not half 
of the counties of the State reported the scholastic population of 
this (the third) year in season. 
TLL. He must see that the people are aroused to building school- 
houses. Alas! who would want to represent Tennessee in a World’s 
Fair, by an average specimen of the school-houses of the State? 
IV. Indeed, he must go back of these duties often, and attend to 
keeping up the Boards of Directors. 
V. He must visit the schools, and aid the teachers in -securing 
the best methods of discipline and instruction. In these visits he 
not only improves the teachers’ work, but powerfully affects the in- 
dividual pupils. How often the words. dropped on these occasions 
shape important characters! How frequently we read such testi- 
mony as this: ‘(A few words, which I heard in my boyhood from 
Horace Mann, changed the history of my life, and first inspired me 
with a desire and a determination to secure a liberal education.” 
Says a Connecticut educator : 
“JT doubt if the Governor of the State, in time of: peace, could do a greater 
service to the State than by visiting the public schools, and thus encouraging the 
friends of education, by showing a personal interest in the work. All that ie 
necessary is to make the public think how important it is that the public schools be 
well sustained. They will then see that it is done.” 
These young minds are the richest jewels of the State. Their 
polishing is more important than work on gold or diamonds. The 
County Superintendent not only visits the place where they are 
polished, to improve the work, but to inspire other men of scholar- 
ship to do so, and to bring in the parents. He aids the teacher in 
making the school the focus of neighborhood thought, interest and 
visitation. Should he be incompetent, or neglect his duty, the sys- 
tem should not be charged with his failure. But a man cémpetent 
and worthy of the duties should be secured.
-P-A-G-E-140
140 
VI. He teaches the teachers, and he brings them together so that 
they teach each other. No one expects to raise up officers for an 
army without training. No one expects an army to operate witt out 
ahead and a complete set of subordinate officers. The army of 
teachers arrayed against ignorance and vice can neither be raised 
without training, nor conduct its operations successfully without 
officers. 
VII. The County Superintendents must correct any errors of 
school management. If a teacher is not doing his duty, and after 
proper effort for his improvement he still practically illustrates his 
incompetency, the Superintendent should duly revoke his certificate. 
VIII. He must make sure that all reports are legally and properly 
made. This may be called red tape; so may the care with which 
business men conduct their affairs, and the books and records they 
keep be called red tape. It is the only way to be sure that the 
duties are well done; and the judgment which follows well or ill 
doing is one of the strongest motives for teachers and pupils to 
feel. No school system ean be well conducted that is not well 
reported. 
IX. The Superintendent of the county must be vigilant that the 
school may not be neglected, that parents do not keep their children 
from attendance, and that the children are regular, punctual and 
full of enthusiasm. The efforts of the teachers should be seconded 
by him, | 
X. He must have an office: 1st, to keep his own records; 2d,.80 
that he can be readily seen on certain days, to answer the manifold 
questions of teachers, and directors, and parents, and citizens. 
There he should examine teachers, and, if desirable, have meetings 
of teachers and directors. 
He must attend to the school finances of the county—whether he 
has the money in his own hands, as the bonded Treasurer, or con- 
trols their issue by the Trustee on compliance with the law in the 
districts, by approving all bills before paid, is not essential. 
All these duties must be done in the counties, if the children are 
to be educated. What the officer is called, or how he is chosen, or 
how his pay is determined, are all non-essential; but the duties of 
the County Superintendent now performed are essential. These 
duties cannot go undone, and prosperous schools exist. Suspend 
these duties, and the schools will close—the children go at large; 
vice and crime, and non-production of wealth, go on; capital, im-

out of step and be lost behind the onward march of the age, or 
there will rise up men better and more worthy of our places than 
we, to restore and give success to what the ignorance and prejudice 
of our day destroy. 
Before any one throws a stone at the supervision, suppose he 
apply the test of honest observation; spend a day * with the Super- 
intendent in the discharge of his duties, examining teachers, holding 
teachers’ institutes, or visiting schools, or answering inquiries, or 
removing difficulties. The interest is certainly sufficiently delicate 
and vast to merit fairness. : 
I do not dwell here upon the cost. When the public shall come 
to know and appreciate the work done by County Superintendents 
the cost will be little counted. 
Extracts from Reports of County Superintendents,—The 
statistics of population, of the number of schools taught, of pupils 
enrolled and in the respective studies, are from the Reports of the 
County Superintendents. Imperfect as too many of these Reports 
have been, they yet are full of very important facts for the legislator, 
the philanthropist, the scholar, the educator, and the citizen of the 
State. Much other matter was called for; but there were hindrances 
of every kind in the way of getting exact statements. Still, with 
all their defects, nothing else so full and so trustworthy as these very 
Reports has ever been obtained by the State, in the line of social 
science statistics. How the State can be guided successfully in its 
financial and legislative policy, wethowt exact knowledge on such 
various matters, [do not understand. These things are to states- 
men what elaborate charts are to the marinér. The ship, the com- 
pass, and the skill, may all be. good; and yet, without charts, he 
sails a most perilous voyage. 
The extracts, letters and reports, from the various County Su- 
perintendents, in the Appendix, give some insight into the practical 
working of the system. They show something of the trials expe- 
rienced, and are far from representing the extreme. cases.

known as a teacher, in Cheatham County, was the first appointed

Superintendent in that county. Quietly, but faithfully devoting 
himself to overcoming the difficulties in the way of free schools, he 
was successful in their organization generally in the county. This 
useful and estimable officer died during the past summer, 1869. 
Rev. J. G. MeKee, who opened the first free schools for colored 
children in Nashville, in 1863, originally having the uncertain 
tenure of a church basement, or the open air, for a school-room, was 
clearly pointed out as the man to carry universal, free education 
throughout the county. His zeal and his labors were too much for 
his health, and he died in the summer of 1868. 
To each of these faithful servants, the words of the poet may be 
fitly addressed : 
“Servant of God, well done! 
Thy glorious warfare’s past; 
The battle’s fought, the race is won, 
And thou art crowned at last.” 
The County Executive Board.—This Board, composed of three 
Clerks of the Civil District Boards, is elected by the whole body of 
Clerks of Districts in the county. It has proved to be an exceed- 
ingly useful feature of the school organization. Indeed, so effective 
are they, that they have done much labor in looking after educa- 
tional affairs of the county, not specially required by law. Their 
term of service should be fixed; and it should be provided that va- 
cancies occurring may be filled by themselves, by selection from the 
list of School Board Clerks in the county. :

The enrollment on the 1st of November is undoubtedly 200,000. 
Should the system go on undisturbed to the end of the year, we may 
reasonably look for an enrollment, then, of 250,000, out of our 
scholastic population, (imperfectly reported), of 418,725. 
Such, then, are the actual net results of our present system, in 
its two years of life,

Besides Tennessee’s State outlay, several cities, counties and civil 
districts have raised, by voluntary local tax, and paid out for their 
public schools the gross sum of $131,567, (estimated).

These figures, and others that might be added at great length, 
are the basis of the opinions presented on pages 97, 98 and 99. N. 
school system succeeds without the free and liberal exercise of 
the right of the people, in limited local organizations, to vote a tax 
upon themselves for the support of public schools. The decision 
of the Supreme Court against the constitutionality of the provision 
in the law of 1867 for civil district taxation, necessarily well nigh 
paralyzed all educational efforts in the State. 
Those wishing to make further comparisons with other States are 
‘ referred to pages 70 and 71; also to pages 73 to 78, inclusive. 
And, while it is gratifying that our first educational statistics are so 
great when compared with what would have been shown at any 
former time, yet, when placed by the side of similar statistics from 
many other States, we find abundant reason to stimulate the greatest 
effort of our statesmen and citizens. The work is auspiciously begun, 
and has only to be pressed forward steadily and earnestly to bring 
Tennessee up in line with the foremost. 
VI. Turning from these comparisons of ourselves with others, we 
consider a few points suggested by educational and related figures 
drawn from our own finances. Let us look at what the State has 
done, and what she ought to have done. The schools have had 
apportioned to them the collections from the taxes of 1866 and 
1867, amounting to $645,078 ; yielding to each pupil $1.68 for 
the two years covered by this report. The State collected from 
the people, also, the tax of 1868 for schools, which, added to the 
sum just given, should make a total of $1,110,597; yielding to
-P-A-G-E-147
147 
each pupil $3.78. This includes no income from the permanent 
School Fund. 
VII. The whole scholastic population was 410,000, in 1868. 
The entire enrollment of pupils in attendance at school, is 185,845. 
This leaves 224,155 not in attendance; which shows over one-half 
of the whole, unreached by free schools. How many of these are 
in private schools it has been impossible to ascertain. But the 
expense of tuition in private schools is too great to allow us to be- 
lieve that one-half of all our scholastic population can be supplied 
with schools of this class. 
VIII. The aggregate outlay by the State, $573,795 74, when 
distributed equally among the 185,845 enrolled pupils, gives as the 
cost of educating each in free schools $3.08; whilst in private 
schools it is at least three times as great a sum for each pupil en- 
rolled. Consequently the above-named aggregate outlay of $573,- 
795 would have educated only 61,948 children in private schools, 
instead of the 185,845 actually taught in the free schools. To 
educate in private schools the whole scholastic population of Ten- 
nessee at the actual present rates in such schools, would cost 
$3,762,000 a year; but in our free schools, at the present rate of 
tuition, the cost would be only $1,262,000 a year. Hence, if the 
system could only have had for use the $1,110,597 that was put 
into the State Treasury by the people expressly for the free schools, 
this sum would have paid nearly in full for the five months’ tuition 
of every one of the scholastic population in the whole State; and 
that, too, without an additional dollar of expense for State and 
County Superintendence. 
IX. Instead of this rightful outlay upon its free schools, the 
State has, during these two years, paid out on account of crime 
$1,067,032, which is nearly double the sum paid out on account of 
the schools in the same time. Or, in other words, crime has made a 
direct draft upon the State Treasury of $533,516 a year! This 
for State outlay. Let us next see how the counties and cities are 
bleeding at every pore, on this same crime account. Hzact reports 
it is not possible to get, but close approximations can be made. 
From twenty-eight counties, $113,000 are reported, not including 
Shelby or Davidson, or their cities, Memphis and Nashville. This 
rate would give $331,000 for eighty-two counties of the State. 
A legal gentleman, after careful examination of official records, 
gives me, for the last year’s cost of crime in Davidson County, in- ”
-P-A-G-E-148
148 
cluding Nashville, $250,000. In Shelby County, the Memph 
police alone cost $147,702; making $500,000 undoubtedly a lo 
estimate of the expense of administering justice in that sing] 
county. From these facts we get the aggregate for the eighty-fo 
counties of the State, $1,081,000. This, added to the {i © 
from the State Treasury, gives us, for the cost of crime as | 
Tennessee, $1,614,516. If we had heretofore been pay: 
for schools, we should now be paying less for crime. 11’ 
value of property stolen and destroyed by criminals, I do n 
take to compute. 
The single item of bringing convicts to the penitentiary 
ville has averaged $14,268.50 a year, for the last two year: 
that the average yearly cost of county supervision of schools wa: 
$19,152.50. 
X. In statistics, on page 72, it is shown that the averag 
tion of value to cach man, woman and child, is: 
In Massachusetts, . . 
~“In Tennessee, . 
A difference of $108. 503 in favor of the bleak and ster 
and against the fertile and temperate one. What makes t 
ence? Universal education in the one and the lack ther: 
other. For particulars and details of this vastly important point, 
see Appendix Cc. Let us now apply this vital fact: 
The population of Tennessee is, by last census, 1,109,801. Le 
become as well educated as the population of Massachusetts. ne 
result will be to make each earn an additional $103.50 a year. The 
total addition thereby to the wealth of the State would be $114,864,- 
403 a year. The State debt is less than $38,000,000. Hence the 
addition to the yearly State production caused by the above-named 
increase of intelligence, would pay off the State debt three times in 
a single year, and then leave a balance of nearly a round million 
dollars on hand. 
Another view: It is well ascertained that the intelligence added 
by knowing how to read and write adds one-quarter to the yearly 
product of value by a mere common laborer. Our blacks are 
mainly common laborers. Now the number, of blacks enrolled as 
pupils in our free schools is hard upon 26,000. ‘Their yearly pro- 
duct of value, at the Tennessee rate of $63.10, is $1,640,600. 
Let these 26,000 become good readers and writers; their produc- 
tion rises by one-quarter of itself, and thus adds $410,150 a year
-P-A-G-E-149
149 
to the wealth of Tennessee—a sum nearly equal to.the two last 
years’ outlay for free schools for the whole people of the State. 
If, then, the teaching of 26,000 freedmen does in one year pay the 
two years’ schooling of the whole enrollment of the State, it seems 
worth while to teach them promptly and vigorously. 
PRESSING EDUCATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS. 
1st. Correct ideas should be obtained and disseminated in regard 
to our educational affairs. 
2d. The requirements of the fundamental law of the State in 
regard to school moneys should be more fully understood, and 
should be faithfully observed. This makes every dollar of money 
accruing to the State for school purposes sacred for those purposes, 
and renders it unconstitutional for any power, short of the people 
acting in due form for the abrogation of this feature of the Consti- 
tution, to divert it to any other purpose. The passage of any law 
to use school moneys for other purposes, is clearly unconstitutional. 
3d. It should be distinctly understood that the schools now 
legally opened and conducted in the faith that the State will pay 
over the moneys collected for school purposes, will have valid claims 
which cannot be eonstitutionally repudiated. 
4th. The apportionment of the collections from the tax of the 
year 1868, and the liquidation of claims for services now held by 
teachers, should be promptly made. / 
5th. There should be renewed determination on the part of all 
teachers, directors, parents, and friends of education, and of the 
State, that no backward step be taken. 
6th. Efforts should follow to correspond with such a determina- 
tion. They should improve the present work as fast as possible, 
and let all who desire to know have the facts. 
Tth. Not a school should be closed before its time. Every suc- 
ceeding term of school under the system is an improvement on the 
preceding. The system has this excellent capacity for advance- 
ment towards perfectibility. The multitude of schools now open 
over the State have, as generally reported, twenty-five per cent. 
greater attendance than those opened in the same localities last 
year. Who could contemplate the catastrophe of closing these 
schools with composure? What other calamity could equal it?
-P-A-G-E-150
150 
     
    
   8th. Nothing should be done to create distrust and add to th 
discouragement of school officers and friends of education. 
generous confidence should be given them. Their efforts shoul 
have a fair trial. This is impossible, if every citizen does not d 
his duty. Up to the present, the system has not had a moment o: 
fair trial. Educational meetings should be everywhere held. 
9th. There should be legislation limited and carefully devised, 
removing what experience has found defective in the system, and 
adding what it points out as necessary. None can afford to take 
the responsibility of any other. 
10th. Every school, not already opened in the ‘State as the law 
requires, should be opened at once. The tax of 1869 is new in 
process of collectien. It should yield about the same to the pupil 
as the tax of 1867 did, and it should be apportioned in season to 
pay those now teaching, when their five months’ services close. 
Teachers and officers of the law should have no fear. The people 
pay the taxes for the schools, and the law provides for its expendi- 
ture in support of schools.. Every obligation for services created 
in accordance with law will be valid. 
The people demand the schools, and should not be disappointed. 
A Word of Suggestion in Reference to the Repeal of the 
School Law.—Those who propose to destroy the present school 
law, I would most respectfully suggest, should cofsider that : 
I. It was enacted, after prolonged consideration, at great legis- 
lative cost. 
KI. it has cost much labor and expense, also, to put the law in 
operation. 
Til. The system it establishes is good in itself. 
IV. It has done superlative good elsewhere, and has accomplished 
more in Tennessee than could have been expected under the cir- 
cumstances of want of money, and with opposition so persistent. 
V. It is now over the greatest necessary difficulties in the way of 
its success. 
VI. It is in the line of the education movement of the age. No. 
State in the Union is now satisfied without an efficient system of 
free public schools. If this one, which has been inaugurated at 
such cost’and with such care, is destroyed in Tennessee, it will 
necessarily. be revived. It must be. Nothing can prevent it in 
any American State. The people will have it for their children.
-P-A-G-E-151
151 
The cost would, therefore, have to be incurred again. The responsi- 
bility, as a matter of course, will be traced and fixed where it be- 
longs. Rather who would not have it said of Tennessee, as in a 
late Annual Report of Prussia: “There is not a ‘single human 
being in Prussia who does not receive education, intellectual and 
moral, sufficient for all the needs of common life?’’ 
To the friends of education I would say: 
“Doubt not but success 
Will fashion the event in better shape 
Than I can lay it down in likelihood.” 
Carlyle says: “It is the clearest duty, prescribed by Nature 
herself, under silent but real and awful penalties, of governing per- 
sons in every society, to see that the people, so far as possible, are 
taught; that wherever a citizen is born, some chance be offered him 
of becoming a man. This is forever the duty of governors and 
persons of authority in human societies.” 
CONCLUSION. 
The struggle of these two years has been too intense, and fraught 
with consequences too far out-reaching all human conception, to pass 
even the least aids as trifles. My thanks are due to all who have in 
any way co-operated in perfecting the system of education, and 
promoting its success in the State, whether by railroad facilities, or 
influence of the press, or pen, or speech. They are especially due 
to your Excellency and your predecessor, for uniform and hearty 
co-operation in promoting this great public interest. 
Dr. A. Gattinger, Librarian, who by law receives five hundred 
dollars per annum, as Secretary of this office, though he could not 
be in the office, has labored earnestly and well, often at the cost of 
nights of rest, on the books of population and finance, which he 
could take elsewhere. To Professor Henry Pomeroy, A. M., of 
Dandridge, Jefferson County, formerly Professor of Civil Engineer- 
ing in Lawrence University, Wisconsin, of large experience, ready 
in office work, familiar with the philosophy of our American free 
school system, and observant of the facts in its development, I am 
indebted for continued and very competent assistance, especially in 
the statistics. . 
It is due that I should say to all who have set no measure to the
-P-A-G-E-152
152 
violence of their opposition, and to those who have placed no limits 
to their misrepresentations of the system, and of me, personally, 
that their hostility has not been reciprocated. Guarded by a 
thorough consciousness of the rightness of my own purpose to do as 
well as in my power the work committed to me, at whatever sacrifice 
of convenience and health; though the flames of hostile pyrotechnics, 
thrown never so violently, have arisen about me, they have created 
no hesitancy, nor given me a moment of heat. For the evil they 
have done—stopping the building of school-houses, and closing 
schools, and hindering the success of the system—lI am not responsi- 
ble. My regret is, that they did not save themselves the folly and 
pangs of their sin against the public and themselves, and that more 
schools have not been opened, more and better school-houses built, 
more teachers been paid, and more pupils instructed. 
But those who have, with the hope of personal advantage, made 
attacks on the system and its officers, we may hope ere long to see 
champion it for the same reason. Some appearing to think the 
sensitive condition of the public mind was opportune, have fooled 
themselves for my amusement, by charging dishonesty. There has 
been neither temptation nor trial in that direction. Pecuniary 
honesty has been among the virtues on which I have felt the least tax. 
The task has been to furnish skill and prudence that should never be 
at fault, zeal that should never flag—patience, never lacking en- 
durance—and to keep the over-tasked vital forces from extinction. 
Misrepresentation, bitterness, are not terms adequate to express 
the character of the opposition in different quarters. This has, 
however, in not a few instances, given place to strong favor and 
earnest support. Had the system had ample means, or even the 
moneys the people had paid to the State for its support, or had it 
had no friends that were neither hot nor cold, and no enemies utterly 
unscrupulous of the public welfare, but had it been given a fair 
trial upon its merits, how much more satisfactory its results! 
Committing the system to the Providence under whose favor it 
has been inaugurated, and to the efforts of the noble men who believe 
in man and God, who watch and guard the interests of the young, I 
would remind the ambitious of Napoleon’s declaration, that “the 
true victories, which we need never lament, are those won over the 
domain of ignorance,” and would recall to the recollection of states- 
men the striking remark of the sage historian, who, reviewing the 
rise and fall of States and peoples, exclaimed: ‘ What is the first
-P-A-G-E-153
153 
part of politics? Education. And thesecond? Education. And 
the third? Education.” 
Events with the young will not wait for sluggish movements. 
Soon, all efforts for those now young will be too late. It is stated 
that when the philosopher, Anaxagoras, lay dying for want of sus- 
tenance, one of his distinguished pupils sent him a sum of money. 
“Take it back,” said the dying sage; “if he wished to keep the 
lamp alive, he ought to have administered oil before.” For the 
parent or State that neglects the child there may be occasion for a 
more cutting rebuke. The Scripture maxim, “He that soweth 
sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he that soweth bountifully 
shall reap also bountifully,” holds true of States and their expendi- 
tures for schools.

. ‘“Murrrnusnoro, Sept. 13, 1869. 
Gen. Joun Eaton, Jn., Sup’t Public Instruction: 
S1z:—In reply to your request, made to me, to furnish to your Department, to 
be kept with its records, a history of the origin and of the passage of the “Act for ~ 
the Re-organization, Supervision, and Maintenance of Common Schools,” I respect- 
fully sabmit the following: 
The Hon, John Trimble, on the 13th of April, 1865, offered to the Senate the 
Senate Resolution No, 26, as follows: 
“ Resolved—That it be referred to the Committee on Common Schoo]s and Education, to 
take into early and earnest consideration the whole matter of Free Common Schools, and at as 
early a day as practicable, report a system of Free Common Schools, to be put into operation 
throughout the State, That it also report what tax is necessary, and how the same may be 
raised,” 
This resolution, under a suspension of the rules, was referred to the Committee 
of which T was Chairman. 
The Committee on Education and Common Schools made the following report 
June 3, 1865: . 
“The Committee on Education and‘Common Schools have the important subject referred to 
them under consideration, The educational interest of the State has awakened a new and more 
intense feeling in its behalf, growing out of the belief that the future of Tennessee demands a 
more thorough system of public instruction than that upon our statute books, In connection with this topic, the Committee cannot forbear to say, that the work before them needs careful investigation and comparison of the school systems in successful operation in other States, to 
orgunize one for Tennessee, eminently calculated to elevate the character of our Primary ols. “The Committee ask that the time to make their report be postponed till the next meeting 
of this General Assembly, that they may mature their deliberat ions and perfect a bill, 
W. BOSSON, Chairman.” 
The summer months of 1865 were employed in reading the school systems of 
other States, corresponding with and receiving the reports and suggestions of State 
Superintendents, and perfecting the original bill. On completing this work, in 
September, 1865, I had the bill printed for the purpose of submitting the system 
to the criticism and judgment of Educators of our own and other States. Owing to 
the magnitude of the subject, I deemed it of the first importance to have the sys- 
tem as practicable and perfect as the common councils of Educators could make it, 
having reference to the character of our people as I had observed it for twenty-five 
years, and their new, changed relations. A meeting was called of the practical 
educators of Nashville, and obtained their criticisms and suggestions. Copies of 
the printed bill were sent to George B. Emerson, of Boston, Professor Edwards, of 
Ohio, and Professor L. C. Draper, of Wisconsin, for their consideration, and re- 
ceived their slight amendments and approval. The work was greatly encouraged
-P-A-G-E-160
Iv 
py the friendly and timely suggestions of the Rev. J. B, Lindsley, of the Nashville 
University, the Rev. Mr. Hume, of the Hast Tennessee University, Senator Joseph 
Fowler, Judge Samuel Watson, Professor Lawrence, Professor Ogden, of Nashville, 
and the Hon. Horace Maynard, of Knoxville—all of whom, familiar with the “old” 
system, regarded the ‘new’ as meeting the educational wants, and adapted to the 
existing condition of the educational interests of the State. , 
I incorporated into the system those features of other systems adapted to our 
condition and wants, and which had been found necessary and healthful, leaving 
out much, hereafter to be added when our educational interests shall be more fully 
developed. . 
On the 2%th October, 1863, as Chairman of the Committee, I presented the Senate 
Bill No. 170, “An Act to provide for, the Re-orgainization, Supervision and Main- 
tenance of Common Schools,” accompanied by a written report, from which I make 
the following extract: 
“In entering on the discharge of the responsible duty entrusted to them, your Committee 
coutd see no good reason why the educational systema should not be removed as far as possible 
from all friction with, or dependency. on, any other executive branch of the State Government. 
The object sought by the’ organization—its importance—the .vast interests involving the in- struction of the young the cultivation and development of the intellect of the present and up- 
rising generation of the future—claim that our Freé Common School System should rely for its 
usefulness and success on its own economy, strength, and self-sustaining machinery, and not 
on the disinterested agencies connected with other branches of the Civil Government. 16 will 
be seen, therefore, that we have go arranged the parts and: completed the system that it may stand alone, dignified by its independence, relying on its own agencies and energy for the ac- complishment of its important mission. We have also aimed to remove the agencies and op- erations of the system as far as possible from frequent political influence, which so often mis- 
directs the wisest legislation. The bill preserves the personal interests of Education to the 
electors in the sub-distriets, by the popular election of Directors, and their representalive voice in the election of County Superintendents. Your Committee believe that. a powerful stimulus 
would be given to the zause of popular education by the services of an efficient County Supe 
intendent, who should devote « sufficient time to the educational interests of his special dis- trict, exercising a thorough supervision of the schools and their economy, collecting statistics 
and detailed statements of the conduct of teachers, and the progress and condition of the school 
interests.of his county, cautiously observing that the school law is faithfully executed, and thus inspiring with the teachers, in the schools and among school officers and people of his 
district, a generous devotion and liberal enthusiasm in the noble work of Education, * * “* 
“Phe Committee do not deem it necessary to present an argument in support of Publie In- struction. The experience of the last four years—the long suspension of the work—the ne- 
‘lected: instruction of the children of the State—the inefficiency of the present school system 
fine patchwork: of forty years of legislation) to bulld up and pnotgise popular instruction—all alike demand from the Legislature the organization of a broad and liberal system of Publie In- 
struction, that shall place our own alongside of our sister States in the civilizing and ennobling enterprise of instructing and educating the intellectual and moral character of the rising gen- erations, on whose intelligence and virtue is to rest the future welfare and happiness of the 
State, The Common Schools of Tennessee should be declared as free as the air we breathe, 
as common and as priceless as the gushing waters provided for man’s refreshment, to every 
ghild of proper age, and their support should be derived from a tax on all the property of the   
  The Bill passed its first reading October 28th, 1865, and one hundred copies 
ordered to be printed for the use of the Senate. November 6th, the Bill passed 
its second reading, with slight amendments, every section being read, explained, 
compared, and advocated; ani came up.as the special order for its third reading, the 
5th of December, when it was amended on my motion,.and made the special order 
for the 12th of January, 1866, when its further consideration was resumed; and 
from the 12th to the 22d of January, the Bill No. 170, passed through a searching 
discussion as the continued special order, requiring constant explanation and de- 
fense of its assaulted provisions; and especially that of the 17th section, provid- 
ing for the equal education of the colored children. An amendment was offered 
“that the education of the colored people, shall be by taxation, to be levied and 
collected upon the property of the colored population; that was attempted to be 
amended, by striking out the entire 17th section; both amendments failed. Ayes 
18, Noes 5. The previous question was then moved and carried, and the bill put 
on its reading and lost. Ayes 8 Noes 9.. January 23d, Senator Bowen asked
-P-A-G-E-161
v 
leave to record his vote, and voting in the affirmative, moved a reconsideration of 
the vote rejecting the bill. The 17th section of the bill, so far in advance of colored 
suffrage and colored manhood, was obnoxious, and deemed to be premature. 
The vote rejecting the bill, was reconsidered February 18th, and put on its final 
passage, and after a single argument was passed, but despoiled of some features 
of the original bill. 
The bill was immediately transmitted and came up in the House May the 18th, 
1866; read the first time and referred to the Committee on Education and Com- 
mon Schools. The committee returned the bill without report, and on the 19th of 
May, it wastaken up, and a motion made to indefinitely postpone the bill, which for 
the want of a quorum was not considered. The bill No. 170, was called up May 
25th, and made the special order for November 12th, 1866. This postponement 
afforded an opportunity io members to investigate the subject, and to consult 
their constituents. February 26th, 1867, the bill was again considered, and bill 
No. 865; offered in lieu, which was voted down by a decisive vote; and No. 170, 
made the special order for the 27th and 28th, when it came up for consideration 
on pending amendments, leading to an abandonment of all House amendments, 
and the bill was passed on the 28th. Ayes 88, Noes 29. Transmitted to the Senate, 
and was signed by the Speakers of both Houses, and became the law, March, 1867, 
The opposition to the bill, was founded generally on the following objections: 
First,—To assess @ general tax on property and polls, for educational purposes., 
would require the wealthy counties to assist in the education of the children of the 
poorer counties. 
Second,—That the large cities and towns supported their-own schools, and ought 
not to he taxed and the moneys distributed pro rata for the support of education 
in other localities. This class of objectors-would vote for the bill, if the amount to 
be levied and collected in each county, was permitted to remain to be used for 
school purposes in the city, towns, or county wherein collected. 
Third, ~-That the amoutit of money preposed to be levied and collected by the 
bili, would afford too much education in advance of that which the children had 
been accustomed to receive under the old Jaw. 
Fourth,—The white people owned all the property of the State, and ought not to 
be taxed to educate the colored children of the State. This objection had very great 
weight with Senators and members of the House; and assumed a more threatening 
attitude of opposition, than any others. 
All these objections were more popular at that time, than wise. 
It is gratifying to be advised, that you have found the machinery of the law, to 
work smoothly, when operated by competent hands. That, instead of the ma- 
chinery being too cumbersome, its agents have been only equal to the demand of 
the work, in taking charge of and directing under the law, the most weighty in- 
terests of the State. 
The loss of the School Fund, deposited 3 in the Bank of Tennessee, the interest of 
which was annually appropriated to the support of schools; the financial embar- 
rassment incidental to the war, and the want of a proper. system in accounting 
for the money properly by law belonging to the “Fund,” for annual distribution, 
has generally embarrassed and retarded the smooth working of the law. All that 
is now required, is a wise, justand prompt execution of the law, to accomplish in 
asatisfactory manner the benefits designed to be secured by the organization of 
the system. It should have a fair trial, ought not to be tampered with for “light 
and transient” causes and objections, but time should be afforded to determine 
what wholesome amendments may be required.

Asa Senator, and afterwards as a member of the House, and as Chairman of the 
Committee on Education and Common Schools in the House, on which I happened 
toMiave a seat, the cause of education has received my earnest, honest, and de-

under consideration shall be a success, or that another shall take its place and 
accomplish more good, W. BOSSON.

INSTRUCTIONS. . * 
a 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, . 
Orricz SUPERINTENDENT Pusiic INSTRUCTION, 
NasHvILLE, October 22, 1867, 
Sir :—In communicating to you the notice of your appointment as 
County Superintendent of Public Instruction, I take the opportunity to address 
you more in detail upon the work before you. ‘It is of great importance that you 
should enter at once upon the discharge of your duties with all energy, earnest- 
ness and prudence. Numerous letters, as well as personal representations, reach- 
ed me from different portions of the State, before the law gave me any legal au- . 
thority, and consequently before I could reply officially, asking information in 
reference to all the details of organization under the new School Law, manifest- 
ing great and gratifying interest in the object of the law, and in some cases, not 
a little impatience to see in schools the results of the taxes already paid. 
The gain of ignorance and of vice, through the interruption of educational in- 
strumentalities during the war, and the tens of thousands formerly prohibited the 
advantage of schools, just now crying aloud for a knowledge of letters, unite in 
suggesting considerations, rendering it most important that there should be no 
unnecessary delay in organizing the schools in every district in the State. Special 
responsibilities are imposed upon you by the terms of the law. These have been 
increased by the delay of organization, If the Act of March 5th, 1867, under 
which the schools are now to be conducted, had been fully executed up to this 
time, you should be able to report to this office, forthwith, at least : 
Ist, That.on the first Saturday in June, at'the usual voting place in each civil 
district, a Board of three School Directors was elected for each sub-district. 
2nd, That the records of that election were properly certified to the Directors 
chosen, for preservation. 
8rd, That these Directors, duly qualified and organized by electing a clerk, pro- 
ceeded in the discharge of every duty. 
4th, That the Clerks go elected have organized, as required, as the Board of 
Directors for the civil district, and met at least in regular session, on the “first 
Monday of September.” 
5th, That “the Directors in each sub-district,” “between the first and third 
Mondays in May,” tock “an enumeration of all the white and ‘colored youths 
between the ages of six and twenty years,” and reported as per section 7. 
From some counties, a portion of these facts can be reported, from others 
none. The organization of Boards of Directors, and the taking of the scholastic 
population, are essential to the execution of the law. Lack of information has 
been largely the cause of these omissions. The progress of time has rendered 
compliance with the law, according to the specified dates, impossible ; but the ob- 
ject and spirit of the law remain. The undischarged obligations are still bind- 
ing. The great public good to be accomplished, demands that every obstacle 
should be overcome in meeting those obligations. The spirit of the law not only
-P-A-G-E-164
VIII 
implies a correction of these omissions, but the terms of the law provide for 
that correction specifically in part. It requires “the State Superintendent to de- 
vote hig time to the care and improvement of common schools, and the promo- 
tion of the general interests of the education of the State.” 
This office is made the medium of communicating the information necessary for 
the execution of the laws relating to schools. The Superintendent must not only 
furnish copies to the Superintendents of Counties, but must accompany them 
“with appropriate forms and instructions for carrying said law into execution.” 
Each County Superintendent receives a corresponding résponsibility for his 
county. “The County Superintendent of Education shall have the care of the 
educational interests of the county. He shall visit frequently the sub-district 
schools of the county, counsel with and encourage Directors and Teachers, see 
that the common school law is properly enforced, and do all things to promote 
the cause of education in the county.” 
Now, therefore, in the discharge of my duties, and for the furtherance of the 
discharge of yours, in bringing the execution of the law up to the present time, 
by promoting the doing of what has been omitted, I most earnestly press upon 
your immediate attention the prompt compliance with the spirit, and as far as 
possible, with its terms; and do therefore instruct you to convey to each civil 
district, and to each sub-district, as far as known in your county, copies of the 
law ;—it would be well if you should do this in person,—calling special attention, 
I. To section 4, of the School Act of March 5th, 1867, and furthering, by every 
means in your control, organization according to its provision. The best men, 
who will do most, without compensation, for the education of the people, are 
needed as Directurs. The manner of caring for the records of their-election, and 
the manner of their qualification, as well. as their organizatiog, should be the 
same as if they had been elected in-June. Should there exist any doubt in re- 
gard to the boundaries of sub-districts, you should call attention to. section 1, 
which provides, that “every organized civil district shall compose but one school 
district, forall purposes connected with the general interest of éducation ;” and 
further, that ‘the several districts which now are, or may hereafter be established, 
shall be regarded as sub-districts.” The old school district here recognized as has 
been understood, was according tosec. 981 of the Code, a civil district, unless the 
Commissioners “laid off” the county differently. These Commissioners were re- 
quired to furnish a “plan of the district or districts, altered or created, to the 
County Court Clerk,” “to be registered in his book.” If, on application to the 
Clerk of the County Court,” no information can be obtained upon any such 
sub-division of the civil districts, nor authentic information from any other 
source, then, according to the terms of the Act of March Sth, and of the Code, 
the civil district must be treated as a sub-district in organizing a Board of Direc- 
tors, You will observe, also, sec. 8, provides, “where there is but one sub-school 
in any civil district of the State, the Directors thereof shall discharge the duties 
conferred on the civil district Board of Education, until such time as two or more 
sub-district schools are organized;” that is, if any civil district was divided, as 
provided by the Code, into sub-districts, each sub-district is to be organized as 
provided in.section 4; and if a civil district has not been so divided, then it is to 
be organized as in the ease of a sub-district. Hach old schoo) district, whether 
ite territory is embraced in one or more civil districts, is to be “regarded as a 
sub-district.” ‘The organization of the Boards of Directors completed, you will 
call attention, .

years. It is important that the report to you should give the names of each one 
of the scholastic population. These reports you will consolidate and forward 
here, as required: Section 7 provides: in ease of omission, by the proper sub- 
district officers, to take this enumeration-at the designated date, that “it shall be 
the duty of the Clerk of the Board of Education for the civil district, to employ 
a competent person to do the same, and allow a reasonable compensation for his 
services.” There having been no Directors in the sub-district, there can, of 
course, be.no civil action taken for the omission this season, as suggested in that 
section. If any civil district fails to-organize, and there is, therefore, no Clerk 
of the Board of Education to do this, a case is presented for which there is no 
specific provision in the law; but the necessity for the enameration remains. 
The law, moreover, is imperative and fixes the penalty... Sec. 48 provides, that, 
“any school district, city, incorporated town or village, which shall have failed 
to make and return the scholastic enumeration required by this Act, shall not be 
entitled to receive any portion of the Common School Fund.” ‘The absence of 
the enumeration of scholastic population in a single civil district, will, in the 
first place, deprive the. children of that district of all benefits from the school 
fund; and, second, will interfere with the distribution of that fund throughout 
the State in every county. To you alone, this office looks directly for the report 
of the scholastic population. It is to be most earnestly hoped, that no civil dis- 
trict will, by failing to organize, create a derangement so serious. Should any 
one fail, your wisdom may be able to devise means, through voluntary efforts of 
public-spirited gentlemen in the county, to secure the taking of the enumeration, 
so that the necessary results may be forwarded to this oftice, and the public 
benefits intended by the law for every child may be neither delayed nor turned 
aside. 
III. You should at once call the attention of the Board of Education in cities 
or incorporoted towns, if there are any in your county: Ist, to section 30, and 
obtain for this office a copy of their last report, also the report of the scholastic 
population for their municipality. “You should also call their attention, 2d, to 
section 17;,andif they have not already complied with its provisions, you should 
urge upon them the importance of immediate and adequate action. Should any 
Board of Education refuse to furnish these separate’ schools for colored youth, 
according to the requirements of the law, such refusal they will see, is to be 
reckoned among those acts, the non-performance of which makes it unlawful 
“for the County Superintendent to pay over any portion of the Common School 
Fund to any local Treasurer” of such non-complying school organization. 
IV. Touching the adoption, by any Board of Directors when organized, of 
schools previously established, I should deem anything at present unnecessary, 
were it not forthe numerous inquiries already before me, Manifestly, the teachers 
of such schools must have certificates from the County Superintendent, and the 
schools must, in all respects, comply with the requirements of the law, by being 
under the mangement of the appropriate school officers. If this is done, there 
may be, in some instances, special advantages in taking up existing schools 
These schools are, in some instances, for colored youth, and in others for white. 
The same principle applics to each. Perhaps, however, in'some communities, 
special irritation may be avoided by retaining the schools for colored youth, al- 
ready established, with only such changes:as are necessary to conform to the 
school law.. All friends to the State, and all who wish well for mankind, should.
-P-A-G-E-166

frown upon the unnecessary remarks already made against the law, charging 
that it forces the commingling of races. There is no such provision in it. And 
this excitement of old prejudices can only be injurious. 
Each Superintendent can only be held responsible for the administration of the 
law as it stands. It was not framed, neither can it be executed, in the interest of 
any class, but for allclasses and for all the people. Communities need have no 
doubt that yqu and each Superintendent will be carefully held accountable for its 
impartial administration. It will gratify my earnest desire, should its adminis- 
tration in reference to the point upon which there is so much sensitiveness in so 
many communities, be so just and faithful as to leave no room for reasonable com- 
plaint. 
These first instructious are extended only so far as is deemed essential to start 
the operation of the law. Free and frequent communication is desired from you 
and all others favorable to the great public work. But prompt and full reports 
will be required from you. Your first report should cover, at a date as early as 
possible, all the requirements of these instructions They should specify, 
Ast, The facts of organization. 
(a) The number of Boards of Education in each civil district, their names, and 
the one selected as clerk. 
(6) The extent to which the Boards organized, have acted under the law; 
whether they. have secured the levying of any special local tax, or taken any 
other measures for the establishment of schools. 
(c) The civil districts or sub-districts, if any, which have not organized up to 
that date. 
2d, the scholastic population, by sub-district and civil districts. 
8rd, The school-houses, if there be any, and their condition. 
4th, Any school lands or funds known to belong to the State. 
6th, The probable number of Teachers, and their qualifications, that your county 
can furnish for its schools, 
6th, Any other information bearing upon the execution of the law in your 
county. 
These reports should be complete from all quarters of the State by the 12th of 
November next. We may expect, also, at that date, from the appropriatesouree, 
a complete view of the school revenues. This office will then be furnished with 
the proper data, and can determine the appropriation for each county; and the 
Commissioners for the school funds can fix the salaries of the Superintendents. 
The Boards of Directors in the respective districts will know the amount of money 
they have to expend, and the work of securing houses and teachers and opening 
schools can be entered upon at once. The labors of the Superintendents through- 
out the State will have tested, somewhat, the school law, and have gathered a 
considerable amount of information. 
The Legislature will still be in session, and can, if necessary, take advantage of 
the facts then noted, in determining the modifications of the law, if any in their 
wisdom, are demanded. 
The Teachers of the State meet here November 18th and 14th, and it is 
expected that all the railroads of the State will issue tickets at half fare, to the 
educators in attendance. The most eminent friends of education in the State, 
, and others from other States, prominent as educators in the nation, are expected to be present to assist on the occasion, by addresses and counsels, Your personal 
attendance is desired here at that time, Indeed, if your heart is thoroughly in

the work assigned you, you will hardly consent to forego the oportunity thus af- 
forded you, of preparing for the discharge of your duties, Reach here Tuesday, 
the 12th, if you can. . 
I shall expect to meet all the County ‘Superintendents; for, in addition to the 
advantage they will gain from the great gathering of educators, I shall take the 
occasion, when they are assembled, to “counsel and advise” with them, as required 
by law, on the “selection of school books,” the “qualification of: teachers,” “methods 
of teaching,” “arrangement of school districts,” “location and construction of 
school houses; and to convey to them such other “instruction for carrying” the 
school laws into execution as may then seem to be desirable. I expect to effect ar- 
rangements, by which teachers of Nashville will present model classes, white or 
colored, illustrating— 
Ist, The calling and dismissing of school and classes.

9th, “ Grammar. 
10th, “« “ Singing. 
11th, The training of pupils in conduct, both in reference to their health and 
their morals. 
These model illustrutions, it is expected, will be accompanied with discussion by 
practical educators, You will do well to promote the attendance of all persons in 
your county, who propose to seek of you certificates of qualification to teach in 
the schools under your supervision. A moment’s thought on the condition of edu- 
cational information in the State, will suggest to any one, the great benefit to result 
from such a meeting. If we were able to realize our wishes, its salutary influence 
in aiding to start aright the system of free common schools, will be incalculable 
Every motive should inspire us to do the best. The responsibilities committed to 
us are most delicate, solemn and far-reaching. Trusting to the aid of Him from 
whom these responsibilities are received, and to the intelligent co-operation of the 
people for whose benefit they are undertaken, let us go forward, undeterred by 
any obstacles, expecting that the system now inaugurated, is to give to Tennessee 
all the benefits in material prosperity, andin the advancement of intelligence and 
virtue, derived by any State from the best schools, under the best managenient.

CIRCULAR LETTER TO COUNTY SUPERINTENDENTS. 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, OrFicE SUPERINTENDENT Pupuic INSTRUCTION, 
NasHvIL_e, March 17, 1868. 
The instructions from this office of. October 22, 1867, attempted to clear up th 
misapprehensions and misinterpretations of the School Law, so far as. these had 
been made known to me. In doing these, I also hoped to make all the sugges- 
tions necessary to complete the work of organizing districts and taking scholastic 
enumeration. Those instructions contemplated personal interviews with the 
County Superintendents here at the meeting of the educators of the State, Nov- 
ember 13 and 14, when reports of organization and of scholastic population were 
to be received. Many, though not all, of the County Superintendents were here; 
some at great personal expense and. inconvenience, and all had found so many 
practical and serious obstacles in the way of their educational work, that few 
were able to present the reports required. 
The meeting of the State Association was one long to be remembered for the 
progress it indicated in the educational spirit. The meetings and conferences of 
the Superintendents were, in addition, of great significance. It was especially 
gratifying to me to observe the favorable impression made by the spirit and 
ability of the County Superintendents. They discussed, with great care, all the 
difficulties they hud encountered; embodied their views of such changes as seemed 
to be required in the School Law, and left them with me for the use of the Legis- 
lature’ A considerable time was spent in discussing “the arrangement of 
School Districts,” the “location and construction of School Houses,” “ qualifica- 
tions of teachers,” and “methods of examination,’: and the “selection of Text 
Books.” In reference to this last topic, all seemed to feel the importance of a ju- 
dicious selection, and of using the same books throughout the State; and after 
reviewing several plans for accomplishing their purpose, agreed that each should 
, send to me a statement of the books he preferred, and that, with these statements 
before me, I should select and announce for use those books which would, in my 
judgment, best secure uniformity and efficiency. 
Additional meetings were proposed in other parts of the ‘State, Reports of or- 
ganization of districts, and of scholastic population, were to be forwarded as fast 
as possible, All-were anxious about the amount of money to be disbursed by the 
State, and I could only say that I, as others, had first learned that the school tax 
had not been collected, but that, on inquiry of the Comptroller, I had been in- 
formed that it had been collected, and that his report contained the substance of 
all the information I had upon the subject. The correspondence of the office oc- 
easioned by the difficulties in organization, became enormous, Reports from 
counties came in slowly—not a few quite imperfect. 
Another important educational meeting was held in Knoxville, near the last of 
December, at which were also present many County Superintendents. 
About this time it was made public that the Comptroller had said to an Educa- 
tional Committee, calling upon him for information, that there was no school 
money in the Treasury—that it had all been used to pay interest on the bonds for 
railroads,
-P-A-G-E-169
  XII 
The feelings and inquiries awakened in the public mind by this statement, as 
they reached me through the letters which poured into the office, were depressing 
in the extreme; answering them in every case would have been impossible. No 
school money had come into my hands, or under my supervision, : There had 
been no meeting of the Commissioners of the School Fund. No fund had come 
under their care, The entire educational work depended upon securing funds for 
school purposes, and that was ‘to be determined by the course pursued by the 
Legislatute, in shaping the condition of the revenue. For my own assurance of 
what was possible, 1 was compelled to study carefully and somewhat in detail, 
not only the facts, but the general financial principles upon which the receipts of 
the State were to be increased, and the expenditures for railroad interest, and 
leakages in the revenue diminished. By the leakages in the defective Revenue 
Law, as shown by the Comptroller, it appeared that one county diminished the 
amount-due the State some twenty-six thousand dollars. It was soon plain to me 
that a revision of the Revenue Laws, and firm adherence to a few essential prin- 
ciples of finance; would carry the State triumphantly over its difficulties, and re- 
store means for the use of schools; and my anxiety, never able to overcome my 
confidence in the final issue, soon began to give way to the conviction that the 
Legislature would not only make such school amendments as were necessary to 
the success of the Free School system, were the funds in the Treasury and now 
ready for use, but would also give the finances of the State such improvement as 
would enable payments to be made in a few months, to all places where the 
School Law is complied with and schools are taught. - 
The Legislature has now done its work and adjourned. All the great reme- 
dial measures before it had not time to mature and pass, but enough have be- 
ccme laws to enable us to look with assurance for means to pay the services of 
Teachers and Superintendents when they have been rendered as the School Law 
Amendments require. The publication of these amendments it was my desire to 
have in your hands ‘before I sent out another Circular, but, as I am informed, 
they cannot be furnished at once. I send this as so far a relief to public solici- 
tude, and an answer to most numerous letters, as well as. preparatory tothe in- 
structions to follow the publication of the above law. . . 
The following are two sections bearing upon the manner of preserving and 
distributing the school moneys for the future. . : 
“Sre.—. Be it further enacted, That there shall be kept in the office of the State Treasurer and Comptroller, a separate account of all school moneys received and disbursed, and that all moneys collected for school purposes shall be set apart and expended for those and no other purposes.” 5 . “Suc. —. Be it further enacted, That when the State Superintendent shall have closed the 
enumeration of the scholastic population in the State, and shall ascertain the amount due from the School Fund to each child, he shall announce the amount due; but he shail not be required 0 approve the paying over of the same by the State Treasurer for the benefit of any county, city, or district, until the said amount shall be due for services of Superintendents arid Teach- ers actually rendered,” | 
The scholastic population of half of the counties is not yet reported complete: 
It is of the utmost importance that the suspension of labor occasioned by the 
widely disseminated: feeling that the free school system must fail by reason of 
lack of funds, should be displaced by a renewal of the most energetic and pru- 
dent efforts.on the part of Superintendents, School Directors, and friends of edu- 
cation, The date for enumeration of scholastic population for the ensuing year is 
near at hand. : 
The enumeration for last year should be in before that time arrives, so that all 
counties may be treated as nearly alike as possible. It should be kept steadily 
in mind that the amount due any locality can only be ascertained when the entire
-P-A-G-E-170
XIV 
scholastic population of the State has been reported, and the amount due from t 
State to the School Fund has been divided by the sum total of the scholastic pop 
lation so reported, «lsc that the adjustment.of the bonds of Superintendents, a 
consequently their commissions, depend upon the same factors. 
Some places will prefer not to have their five months’ school until another Fa’ 
after the young men have closed the work on the farm, and have leisure to atten| 
school. Others will wish to have their schools commence immediately. Theil 
choice in this matter must be our guide. But whatever this choice may be, ever.

Superintendents are desired to review those instructions, and if anythiz 
in them remains to be done in their counties to complete the same, an. .L,-.- - 
meat once. In addition, I wish forwarded answers to the following inquiries: 
1st. Have there been any Schools taught in your county under the Schoo. 
Law? 
2d. Ifany, when did they commence and close ? 
8d. If there have been no schools so taught, when will the people of your 
county prefer to have their schools commence? 
4th. What action was taken in your county in reference to the eledtion of 
County Superintendent? 
5th. What time, in days, have-you spent in the discharge of the duties of 
your office? 
6th. Do you deem it best that County Superintendents should be paid, (1st,) 
so much each day spent in the discharge of their duties, or (2d,) so much per 
month, or (8d,) so much per year? 
ith. What rate of pay would you consider fair compensation for the services 
rendered ? . 
8th. This office is called upon by those about to publish a list of instructors 
and institutions of learning in the United States, to furnish the list for this State; 
please, therefore, send me the name of each School, Academy and College in 
your county, with its instructors and number of pupils or students; also, each 
public Library, and its number of volumes. 
For the purpose of facilitating the work of summing up the answers when they 
reach this office, I must ask that you prefix to each answer the number of the 
question to which it replies.

NAsHVILLE, June 18h, 1869. 
Ta County Superintendents ; 
Ata meeting-of the Board of Commissioners of the School Fund, held at Knox- 
ville, June 15th, 1868, the following action was taken on the question. of salaries 
of County Superintendents ; 
“ Resolved, That in fixing the salaries of the County Superintendents of Public Instruction, as required by Jaw, this Board, following the rule of the law of the State in respect to the com- pensation of other public services, do hereby fix the salary of said Superintendents at the rate of Four Dollars per diem for the time actually spent in the discharge of their official duties for the first six months, the same to be certified as correct by the Executive School Board of the County.” 
Blank accounts will be sent to you. The time should be made out with care, 
Before forwarding your account you should have your County fully organized, so 
that the Executive Board will be ready to approve it. You should also be sure that 
you have properly informed this office of your having filed your oath and bond. 
If your bond is three times the scholastic enumeration of your County the Clerk 
will be entirely safe in accepting it, should he not know what the State apportion- 
ment to the County is. . 
IL 
There has been some correspondence with this office in regard to the election of 
Superintendents. Some of the letters were without the name of the place go that I 
could ‘not answer them, some entirely unofficial and furnishing no ground for 
action, But all that came to me as official, and by which I could tell where to ad- 
dress an answer, I have tried to act upon as the law requires, and have sent de- 
cisions accordingly. 
Every letter to which an answer is expected should give the Post-office address 
of the writer. . 
TH. 
In carefully avoiding early disbursements for any thing except educational services, 
Thave not before issued many of the blanks prepared for use. These will now be 
soon in your hands, The Register for the School-room I have prescribed and di- 
rected that it be furnished each Teacher by the County Superintendent, held as the
-P-A-G-E-172
XVI 
property of his office, and included in the expenses for his office paid by the Count, 
and to be returned to him by the Teacher before drawing his pay. 
The Kegister selected is, by far, the cheapest offered, and coutains by the pe: 
mission of the publishers, some blanks important to Teachers and District Director: 
Iv. 
All School moneys remaining in the hands of the County Trustees, from the Fund) 
distributed by the State before the war, or raised for schoo] purposes by local tax 
ations, should, after the County Superintendent is properly qualified, be secure: 
by him for immediate expenditure. 
The children need their benefit, and should be no longer deprived of it. N 
Superintendent should allow one cent of money entrusted to him to go out of his| 
hands, without a legal voucher, for he will be held to a strict accountability. 
Great pains should be taken to secure the full advantage to the public of any 
previous investment of School Funds in School houses or School sites. 
Questions arise in regard to the distribution of these old funds. They are, of 
course, in the nature of trusts, and to be distributed as any new fund raised now 
for like purposes, andin a similar manner. If they come into the hands of the 
County Superintendent as due to any particular District, they must be distributed 
to said District on the order of the Directors of the District. If due to the entire 
county, they should be apportioned pro rata among the scholastic population of the 
county. . 
The County Superintendent, in receiving these funds, should, (if any of them be 
in depreciated paper,) be careful to give a specific receipt—naming the issue, its 
market value at the time, etc. The settlement of the Trustee, responsible for these 
funds, is provided for by law. The County Trustee does not determine the manner 
of this settlement, and should not assume such responsibility ; but simply give the 
receipt for the money in kind, and its value as it comes into his hands; and if the 
person holding the funds delays or refuses to settle according to law, he should 
prompt the taking of the necessary proceedings in court to secure the settlement. 
The law authorizes the Superintendent to call on any Attorney-General to protect 
the School Fund in the Vourts, . 
The amendments to the School Law require certain duties of the County Super- 
intendents in regard to escheated lands, and lands sold at tax sales, the title of 
which is vested in the Superintendent of Public Instruction. The duties are plain, 
and no special instructions from this office have so far, been issued. 
v. 
Many inquiries still come here in regard to the use of the School Fund for private 
institutions. It is well known how quickly such a step would destroy any system 
of free schools. A careful reader of the law, tov, will observe that it guards 
against those mistakes in the past, by which the funds went into the pockets of 
private parties, not at all responsible to the public for their qualifications or man- 
ner of teaching; and by which, also, so much public money was expended in 
houses and Jands owned by private individuals, and that are now controlled and 
claimed-by thom to the exclusion of the public... It will bé noticed that the expend- 
iture of the School Fund is only provided for in a certain way. No Teacher. can 
give a proper receipt for a dollar of the school money unless he holds the requisite 
certificate of qualifications, Should any County Superintendent pay out any of it for instruction without such.a receipt, he would be responsible for the amount. * 
Further, the school must be under the management, exclusively, of the proper
-P-A-G-E-173
    XVII 
Board of Directors, and in all respects, conducted according to the School Law, to 
receive any advantages from the Public School Fund. 
Should any Teacher of a private school, or Trustees of a private school, wish it 
to become part of the Free School System, it can be done by the District Directors 
taking the entire management of the school; for the time, controlling the build- 
ing and hiring the Teacher; and the Teacher being examined and receiving a. cer- 
tificate of qualifications from the County Superintendent; and the school becoming 
in all respects, free and public, as required by the School Law. 
Vi 
Cana “contingent fee” be charged? The law does not provide for this. It isa 
dangerous expedient ; but, in some places it has been found that the opposition to 
a tax was such that there could be no school in any other way; and while the 
school was under the management of the proper Board: of Directors, persons who 
were able and willing to pay a contingent fee, such as was mentioned by the Board 
have paid it, to meet the expenses of repairs of the houses, or of furniture, or of 
charts, or other school apparatus, and so assured the success of the schools, great 
care being taken to demand nothing from those unable to pay, or in any way to in- 
terfere with the freedom of the school to all entitled to attend, 
VIL 
Can persons who choose, subscribe among themselves, the amount necessary to enable 
the Directors to meet the expenses of a school in addition to-the amount due the District 
From the State, instead of raising the amount by tazation on the property and polls of 
the District? Certainly this can be done. Any one man, or number of men, can 
give as much as they choose to any Board of Civil District Directors, as they are 
empowered to receive any “gift, grant, donation, or devise,” for educational pur- 
poses. . 
We should honor any bestowal of money or lands, or aid, ag a public benefaction. 
The more educated and advanced any community, the more frequent these contribu- 
tions will be. Indeed, it will be found desirable, 0 doubt, in many districts where 
prosperity has not been fully restored since the war, to devise various means of 
voluntary aid to the schools, so that the money from tho State may go as far as 
possible. 
Never try to extend the time of holding the school by hiring “a cheap teacher." 
No District can aiford to employ “a cheap teacher.” Nothing could be more 
costly. Such a policy would be worse than throwing away the money. It would 
start the young minds wrong—degrade the idea of what a teacher should be, and 
perhaps render a good school in the locality an impossibility for a generation—ac- 
complish an injury that no money would repair. Let no one think I include this 
among the means to which I refer. But I mean that some persons favorably situa- 
ted can give the board of the teacher-~others can provide the fuel, and thus meet 
the incidental expenses, and save a draft for them upon the school money. But 
the law does not contemplate reliance upon either of these expedients. They are 
too temporary, limited and unreliable, to answer the object of a State in the work 
of educating the children. The State looks to a permanent.existence as the con- 
servator of all that man holds dear—life, liberty, property, and the pursuit of hap- 
piness in all his relations, those of the family, society, and of commercial inter- 
course. . 
- Contemplating this permanency of benefits, the State must devise meang and 
2a
-P-A-G-E-174

methods accordingly. The objects sought are too vast to allow any trust in expe: 
dients or in purposes entively out of its own control. These purposes, if not inj 
unison with the State, or formed in strict harmony with it, may become hostile to 
it, and work its perversion or overthrow. 
These results all centre in the young—what they become, the Staté will be. 
These propositions are of the nature of maxims. The State may as well give up 
its future to chance as to neglect the care of its youth. The State, as a civil or 
political term, is inclusive of all kinds of government. The education adopted by 
it is likely to be shaped to the end to be accomplished. If the State is monarchical 
or aristocratic, the educational methods and ideas are selected to induce among the 
young so as fo preserve among the middle aged and old, monarchical or aristocratic 
notions, principles, polity, customs and institutions. Even nations of this sort, 
have found it essential to their success to enforce universal education, to allow no 
mind within the State to escape its influences. Prussia, long ago, required the at- 
tendance of every child-in some school. Her-reduced influence in the affairs of 
Europe for a period of years has been well known. An eminent writer does not 
hesitate to ascribe to the quickening influence of her educational system upon the 
minds of her subjects, her recent triumphs in battle and her advance in power. Lf 
a monarchy or aristocracy, in which the exercise of power is vested in a limited 
ruling class, cannot afford to allow a single mind, however low down in the scale, 
to escape the disciplinary and quickening influences of its educational system, 
much less can a republic, in the making and administration of whose laws every 
man may participate, 
~ Men in a community must either add to its benefits or detract and take from them

or wealth; consumers add to the burthen, The training of the child determines, 
as far as is in human power, to which class he shall belong. Philanthropy, the church, 
good men, virtuous families, direct their efforts to this point. They seck, by good 
training, to make the child a benefit. But when all these agencies have done their 
utmost, multitudes of children remain in ignorance, open to the influences of vice, 
- to be led bya thousand ways into idleness and crime; not only into the non-pro- 
duction of good, but into the destruction of virtue, and of property, and of life. 
It has been found that persons who can read and write, are on the average worth 
twenty-five per cent. more to labor with their hands than those who cannot. 
If a State, then, would increase its product of wealth twenty-five per cent., its 
easiest way is to teach its children to read and write. If so great a benefit could 
be secured by improving the skill of a male, or of the machine, the duty of making 
that improvement would be plain. But advanced training gives a much greater 
per cent. of producing capacity. Out of it comes that invaluable skill which opens 
mines, devises machinery and methods of agriculture, and facilities of commerce, 
that multiply so many fold, man’s wealth and producing power. 
Besides, it has been found by the study of the statistics of crime and ignorance, 
that, on the average, there are fourteen-and-a-half more chances of the commission 
of crime against the laws among those who cannot read and write, than there are 
among those who can, If the State can reduce its chances for crime fourteen-and- 
a-half per cent., and the expense of crime to a corresponding extent, is it not 
bound to do it? 
‘These are the results of averages of a great aumber of facts, Their value is no 
more and no less; but they are sufficiently trustworthy to point to important con- 
clusions—conelusions which certainly no citizen of a republic can afford to neglect.

Education seeks to make every child in the matter of conduct so observant of right 
that he shall be a law to himself, so that he shall be obedient to law and a supporter 
of law, instead of joining the class of violators of law, for whom the whole expense 
of police, magistrates, jails, prisons, and courts and armies, is incurred, 
Could every child-so become a law to himself, not only the court and prison 
would be less expensive, but rcbbery, stealing and murder would cease ; bolts and 
bars and locks would no longer be needed. 
With facts and considerations so important before it, the State, as the great con- 
servator of every citizen’s good for coming generations, as well as for the present, 
cannot trust the work of free education to any.expedient. We must establish such 
methods as will be, as far as possible, bey ‘ond contingencies. 
There may. be good men in a given neighborhood who this year, or for this gen- 
eration, would voluntarily bear the expense of free education for all; but in the 
next neighborhood, or in the next year, or generation, there may be no such men, 
and the young go straight to vice and crime. The State, therefore, while it. wel- 
comes and receives all that individuals will do, or can do, must adopt such’ instru- 
mentalities and methods as will be sure to promote these results every year, in 
every neighborhood, equally for every generation—that is as long as children 
come into the world, and by instruction and training, are to become intelligent and 
virtuous, or by neglect, vicious and criminal. 
This is the method adopted by our State law. The tax will be so light that it 
will be little felt compared with the tuition of pay schools,’ Fairly tried in any 
community, it, vindicates itself, and the people would not allow it to be displaced by 
any other method. So far, the expenditures for jails and penitentiary, and courts— 
indeed, for the various means of detecting and punishing crime—have greatly ex- 
ceeded the expenditures for education, in the State. 
Aad’ in some-localities where the private expenditures for education have been 
large, it is believed by good judges, that by the method adopted by the State, every 
mind could be reached and benefitted, and the advantages for those now enjoying 
itimproved instead of injured, with no greater cost than for the comparatively 
few who are now educated. At the same time, this more general education would 
inereage the ‘product of wealth and diminish the tax for crime, and ‘improve the 
chances for the.attainment of virtue among the young of all classes—a condition 
of society which greatly adds to the value of real property. 
VII. 
Many questions are asked about the use of the Slate Fund. Indeed, there seems 
to be considerable misunderstanding about the object sought by the State in levy- 
ing the school tax. Remembering the objects and methods as indicated above, it 
will be noticed that the State does not propose todo any more asa State than ex- 
perience indicates is required to secure the free education of every child. The 
State determines the methods, enacts the laws, by which these shall be carried out, 
Specifies by what officers its provisions shall be executed, and the manner of raising 
and expending the necessary funds. 
On the principle that che property of the State should educate the children of the 
State, a State School Tax is levied, collected into the Treasury of the State, and 
disbursed pro rata among the children of school age in the State. This is not in- 
tended to be all that is necessary for free education in any locality, but sufficient 
to lighten the burthen in every locality, and so make it possible, as well as to in- 
spire the poorest district to do what is necessary for the free education of every
-P-A-G-E-176
XX 
child in it. Was every locality able and willing of itself, to do it all, to raise its 
own tax, and order a proper school, the State would do less, What the State does 
it intends to do equally. It levies an equal taxon property and polls, and gives 
an equal amount to each child. 
This general view of State action will aid us in understanding how to use State 
funds. Bring into this view the question “Shall the State funds be expended in 
building school-houses?”’ First, It will be observed that the house, its site and 
furniture, do not become the property of the State, but that the title is vested in 
the local Board. They become the property of the civil district as such, and prop. 
erly to be paid for by the district. Second, These properties are necessarily une- 
qual in cost and value. One district gets along with a house costing five hundred 
dollars, and another demands an expenditure of thousands. Tho State could not, 
therefore, undertake to provide these properties without violating its rule of equal 
taxation, unless it gives so much for these purposes to every child, which it has 
not attempted specifically. Third, If it did bestow so much of its funds for build- 
ing purposes to each child, it might fail of its object. It might build good school 
houses all over the State, This would not make schools: indeed, this might be, and 
not a single child taught. Fourth, The expenditures of the State Fund, as provided 
by law, for educational services, when rendered, puts the motive for local action held 
out by the State as near the completion of the object sought, as possible, to-wit: the 
education of every child. 
Short of these completed services nothing is expended. The completion of ser- 
vices can hardly be reached without proper and commensurate local action—enu- 
meration of population, organization, work of Directors, employment of teachers, 
provision of site and house, and conduct of school involving the services of teach. 
ers, attendance and efforts of pupils, and the district provisions of additional 
means by tax, or otherwise, 
Could any one in this view, expect the State so to vitiate and defeat its own 
action, as to allow the funds it distributes to be expended in the erection of build- 
ings? 
There are other slight expenditures incidental to instruction, and much of the 
same character—indeed, often included with those for instruction—for which, itis 
believed the State Fund may also be paid.out, should there be any over and above 
what is required to pay for teaching. But the more carefully the State Fund is ex- 
pended for educational services, and all other expenses are met by local taxation, 
the better satisfaction there will be.

In answer to the many inquiries still coming to this office in. reference to the 
Peabody Fund, and the way in which the Old Academy properties of the State may 
become useful in this day of educational need, I introduce here the following letter 
which has been published, but has not yet, it appears, reached all of the School 
Officers : 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Orrice Sur's Pustic Instruction, 
Nasuvintn, Feb. 8, 1869. 
Hon. Wm. Bosson, Chairman House Committee on Common Schools: 
Sim :—The following generous offer of aid from Rev. B, Sears, D. D., the efficient 
ageut for the Peabody Fund, towards the establishment of graded schools, is an 
opportune encouragement at this moment, so depressing to our educational labors.
-P-A-G-E-177
XXI 
T quote tbat portion of his letter just received relating to ‘this point. He says; 
“Tf acity or town needing aid will provide Free Public Schools, properly organized, for all the children of 2 school-going age, numbering not less than 700, and will do it at an expense of not less than $3,000 to themselves, we will add $1,000 to that sum. For half that number of children (850,) and half the amount of money rajsed ($1,500.) we will give $500; and we will give in that proportion for other schools in any one place, if they are properly arranged and graded, when the pupils of that place number not more than 700 or less than 100,” 
it seems to me the conditions imposed are based on the principles quite as wise 
as the offer is generous. There is a considerable number of towns and villages in 
the State—places whose population is so compact as to warrant the attendance of 
the children on such central schools as not only to secure proper classification, but 
gradation of classes—that may, if they will, avail themselves of this offer of one 
dolar to every three of their own raised for the establishment of such Free Public 
Schools under the direction of the proper school officers. ‘This character of schools 
has met the approval of the advancing educational movements of the age; indeed, 
one of our most distinguished national educators said: “The thorough grading of 
schools, wherever it is practicable, has now become the settled policy of all enlight- 
ened educators.” Really, it is only the application of good sense and system to 
the work of establishing schools. A person who was to provide education for 
children in village would not study so to arrange the classification that no two 
attending to the same subject should recite together.. It would be quite as sensible 
to build a separate house and have a separate teacher for each pupil, The very 
idea of school includes the bringing of pupils together. A wise man would ascer- 
tain the aumber of pupils for whom he had to provide instruction, then about how 
many could be taught by one teacher in the respective studies, and arrange for the 
building of houses and the employment of teachers accordingly. He would con- 
sider each ag deserving of equal advantages with every other, and the whole to be 
taught according to their progress in learning, and not according to what part of 
the village or town they might live in. This would enable him to bring those ca- 
pable of engaging in the same recitation in every subject—as, for instance, addi- 
tioa in arithmetic—together in the same class, and occupying the time of only 
one teacher instead of thatof three or four. Better school houses, better arranged, 
better furnished, together with better teachers, can thus be obtained at less ex- 
pense than poorer houses and poorer teachers on the unclassified and ungraded 
plan. I feel, therefore, that we have special reason for gratitude to the gentlemen 
who are the almoners of this fund, not only for the generous offer made, but for 
their wisdom in prompting us at once to adopt this better way here, at the outset 
in the reorganization of schools in Tennessee. Moreover, I can but consider it 
specially fortunate that the school law provides for exactly such schools under the 
direction of the civil boards, enabling all of our thickly settled districts not only 
to organize graded schools at once, but when they are in need thus to come for- 
ward, and having complied with the conditions of the offer, to avail themselves of 
its advantages. 
All well know how vice and crime flourish where population becomes more 
dense, All know well, also, how the young are thus endangered, and need from 
the State greater provision for their education. Village vices run not only on the 
* boys of the village, but those of the country, The force of these concentrated 
evils has, during the war, fearfully increased over all our educational and counter- 
acting influences, 
In this respect, also, this offer seems to me specially considerate; that it helps 
just where most needs to be done, and where most can be done. Such graded 
schools can be established only where there is the more dense population. But
-P-A-G-E-178
          “XXIE 
girls and boys in more sparsely settled districts need the same free opportunities| 
and gan have them by the Board of Directors transferring them, with the amoun 
_ of school money to which they are entitled, to such graded schools, so that the or 
ganization of a graded school in a village becomes not a benefit as an econom, 
and otherwise, to a village district only, but to all the districis of the county. Fro. 
stich superior schools in each county we might justly expect pupils to begin to 
‘come forward as instructors to supply the demand for good teachers now so deeply| 
felt throughout the State. The institution of the academy took into the account 
many of these considerations. The displacement of the academy, which can be 
attended only by those who can pay tuition, by the graded schools free to all, is 
now the order of educational events. Many of the old academies of this State are 
located just where the graded schools are now needed. Some of these academies, 
too, now unable to do anything of themselves in the way of education, have valu- 
able properties, either in lands, or buildings, or moneys. Their control is so 
vested in the proper academy trustees—this control is so much of the nature of 
vested rights—that it must remain with them, and can not be alienated, but it can 
be leased,.and that for any definite number of years. This property, when so 
leased to the Board of Directors of the civil district will thus, more than ever be- 
fore, become useful for educational purposes. It would, so used, certainly so far 
lessen the expense of establishing schools. Very likely, therefore, by a wise use 
of these properties in this way, and the timely organization in the village districts 
and raising by their own efforts the amount specified, many may not only avail 
themselves of the offer so gencrously made, but be enabled to secure for their 
children an amount and quality of instruction which they have not anticipated ; 
perhaps find this hour seemingly so dark for free schools, the moment from which 
their better day shall begin. . 
The County Superintendents and Boards of Directors, I doubt not, will see this 
combination of favorable considerations and act uponthem. The establishment 
of so grand and beneficial a work as the free and universal education of the child- 
ren of the State, we can neither expect to accomplish without difficulties, nor to 
perfect at once; but as we appreciate its importance and the wisdom with which it 
should be prosecuted, we can but gather new energy from the hope inspired by an 
offer go generous, and with new zeal seek to devise and labor in our laying of the 
foundations that those who come after us will not declare what we have done in 
their way and have occasion to tear it down, but find it in accord with the Great 
Corner Stone that need not and can noé be moved; and so, though incomplete, . yet 
exactly and wisely filted, to receive the work which the busy hands and wise 
prains of ever coming generations, may.do to the rising structure of American 
Civilization. Very respectfully, your obedient servant, —

. [Avousr 3, 1868, This circular has been delayed for an apportionment from the Comptroller. The amount due fom the collection of revenue for the fiseal year ending with September, 1866, he has this 
day réported to me, which apportioned pro rata tothe scholastic population of the'State, yields fo each child included, the amount stated below in the answers sometime since prepared to nu- merous inquiries. In drawing on this.apportionment, all requisitions of the Baperine nts should be made out and signed in duplicete—two additional Treasurer’s receipts should be 
signed alse. Each Superintendent, before receiving any money, should be sure that his bond is made and filed according to law, and this office notified of the same. 
Proper blank receipts and requisitions are sent to each Superintendent.] 
The amount of fund for annual distribution, the subject of so great public
-P-A-G-E-179
XXTIT 
anxiety, can be exactly specified only after the accounts of the County Revenue 
Officers, Collectors and Clerks, have been settled with the Comptroller—these set- 
tlements under the revenue system of the State, in many cases, have been greatly 
deferred, and often at the last date a large amount of releases come to the Comp- 
troller ag an offset for the amount due, according to the tax duplicate; besides, 
the School Fund has to pay certain fees which greatly reduce its amount in some 
counties. © 
These difficulties are now, for the first distribution of the re-organization of the’ 
the schools, still further increased, on account of the unsettled condition of the old 
School Fund accounts. 
The amount of money for any year depends on these two sources il, Taxation, 
2, Income from Sehool Funds and Fscheated Lands. The law regulating the tax 
for school purposes, in existence before the war, was moilified so as to increase the 
amount by the Act.of March Ist, 1867. In re-organizing the State, the old School 
Fund was found to have shared the fate of the Bank of Tennessee. Among the 
recovered assets of that Bank were certain funds which were set apart as so much 
of the School Fund. . 
These, at first, under the charge of a Board, of. which the Governor was chair- 
man, were invested in United States Bonds, except twenty-three old State Bonds 
which were not changed. The Legislature took the control of the fund from the 
above Board, and put it in the hands of the former Treasurer, who deposited it in 
the Bank at Memphis, and afterwards committed suicide. 
The Legislature called upon the Bank for a return of the fund—about one-half 
was returned, and the Bank closed. The former Comptroller receipted for the 
amount collected. 
Now this whole matter remains in the unsettled accounts of the former Treasurer 
or Comptroller, or in.the settlement of the Bank at Memphis; all; however, is be- 
ing pressed to conclusion and settlement, It should be noted that the annual in- 
come from this source only-is for annua] distribution—the principal must be pre- 
served intact, The yield of School Fund from the two sources, taxation and interest, 
since the re-organization of the State Government, was in the custody of the proper 
State officers, The State, under the Internal Improvement Law, of long standing, 
issued and indorsed railroad bonds to the amount of over thirty millions, If the 
railroads paid their interest and principal at maturity, this was no burden to the 
State, and the improvements greatly increased its revenue and the wealth of its 
citizens, by. promoting the development of its vast and rich mineral resources. At 
the close of the war, the railroads generally, in a greatly damaged condition, re- 
ceived further special aid from the State, as it was thought thus to secure a more 
speedy return to prosperity. They were unable to meet the interest due, and the 
State paid it. Some have continued unable to meet the interest, and the State 
having indorsed their bonds, was bound to pay it. The destruction of property in 
the State, and crippled resources of the people, were felt; the State found in its 
hands for school purposes the incomes above mentioned; no free schools were or- 
ganized; there was no action on the part of the people which required the annual 
distribution of the school revenue, The State was responsible for every cent of it, 
and instead of allowing it to lie idle, employed it as a loan to liquidate the interest 
claims, instead of hiring an additional amount from bauks, or levying a tax on the 
people for the purpose. In opening this office in October last, Superintendents 
were promptly appointed, and instructions sent out, looking to an early compliange 
with the law, on the part of the people, so that the benefit of Free Schools could at
-P-A-G-E-180
XXIV 
once be secured. Unfortunately, after the work was auspiciously begun, a convic 
tion spread abroad, that there could be, and would be, no money for school pur. 
poses, and the efforts to organize districts, and to take the scholastic enumeration, 
were well nigh paralyzed. However, I took the responsibility of closing the enu- 
meration, and reporting to the Comptroller in May, Had this been furnished me, 
in November last, as it might have heen, an immediate call for the apportionment 
of the collection of school moneys for the years 1866-’67 would have been made; all 
excuse for the use 6f this money in any other way would have ceased, and the de- 
mand for school purposes could have.been met as readily as the demand for interest 
on railroad bonds, Some places seeing this, and having faith in the action of the 
State, took the scholastic population, organized, reported here, and had schools 
taught. On the report from this office to the Comptroller, in May last, he proceeded 
to close the accounts due and make the apportionment. He reports to me that he 
has progressed so far ag to close the collections for 1866. The necessity for an im- 
mediate distribution is so pressing, that a final settlement of all now due for dis- 
tribution, which would require so much greater delay, is not made, but this amount 
is at once apportioned. It amounts to 48 cents and 7-100's of a cent for each child 
of school age in the State, and reported to this office. 
It does not include the interest due in 1866, on acgount of the unsettled condition 
of that portion of the school revenue. As slightas the amount hore announced due 
one child is, it would be some relief where the law has been complied with, and pay- 
ments are due for services rendered; great difficulties have been overcome; it starts 
the movement of the fund. All will at once ask, how much there will be for distri- 
bution for the use of schools now opening, or to be opened this and the following 
month? It will be seen by the above statement that no one can tell exactly. I 
have purposely made this statement so circumstantial, that others may have the 
same basis of judgment, as faras possible, for their guidance, as there is before me. 
‘They can easily estimate the increase made in the school revenue by the amend- 
ments of March, 1867. The revenue for each of the years 1867 and 1868, will be 
more than-that of 1866, and both will be due when the five months’ schools, now to 
be opened, will be ready to close. Willit be paid at that time? I think it will, 
The Constitution of the State of Tennessee is explicit in regard to the sacred use of 
school moneys: The people have neither granted to any executive officer, nor to 
the Legislature, nor reserved to themselves, the right to divert a dollar of this 
money, without first changing the Constitution. Consequently, a law or vote to 
this effect would be unconstitutional and void, and any executive officer would be 
chargeable with misdemeanor for doing it, and be pecuniarly responsible to the ex- 
tent of bis bond. The difficulties in the way of organization overcome, tog>ther 
with the obstacles to the first payment, and the obligations to use the fund sacred- 
ly, being so supreme, and the public interest in the education of the youth being 
80 unspeakably great, can not every officer, Superintendent and Director, go for- 
ward with assurance? This, it seems to me, should be sufficient to overcome every 
obstacle, and secure the opening of the necessary schools in every district, The 
revenue for the two years, 1866 and 1867, coming together, will be greater than 
can be expected as a rule for any one year by itself. If any District has now ex- 
pended more than is realized from the income of 1866, the Directors will be able to 
calculate approximately how much the total due for instruction will be at the end 
of the next five months’ school, together with the balance still due on the five 
months already taught, so as to estimate very accurately what amount it will be 
necessary to raise by a local tax. In such case, I may add, in answer to inquiries,
-P-A-G-E-181
XXV 
when the amount now distributed does not enable a District to meet the amount 
now due the teachers, the whole amount due to all the teachers in the District 
should he ascertained, and the whole amount due the scholastic population of the 
district, divided equitably among them, paying the same per cent. on each claim, 
In order that all may understand the efforts being made by the Board of Commis- 
sioners of the School Fund to get that fund into shape, and have its annual income 
ready for use, I quote the following resolutions, adopted at the last meeting of the 
Board: 
“ Resolved, That, for the purpose of furnishing this Board an official statement of the condi- 
tion of the Schoo! Funds committed to its charge, the Comptroller and Treasurer be, and are 
hereby, called upon to furnish to this Board an exact statement of the same as they appear in 
their respective offices, giving the source of each item, and the ,mamner in which it accrued, 
and its present condition and manner of investment. 
“ Resolued, That in the opinion of this Board, in making out the indebtedness of the State to 
the School Fund, the State is justly bound to pay interest at 6 per cent. for the time it has been loaned for other State purposes, and that the statement called for above should be made out 
on this basis

STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
OFrFicr SuPERINTENDENT Pusiic InstRucTion, 
. NasHvitLE, August 1, 1868, 
To County Superintendents of Public Instruction : 
Uniformity of text-books throughout the State saves a scholar the price of new 
books every time he changes school, guards the public against the expense, and 
the disastrous influence upon scholarship, of too frequent change of books, and be- 
comes an object to be sought under the general obligations imposed upon every 
school officer, and especially upon this office. The general law, moreover, is spe- 
cific in requiring this duty, except for the cities of Memphis and Nashville, the 
selection for which is vested in their respective educational officers. _ 
The County Superintendents, with these considerations in view, at a meeting of 
a large number of them in November last, after considerable discussion, agreed it 
was best that the Superintendents throughout the State should examine the books 
sent them, and furnish me their views, and that with their statements, and 
the books before me, I should announce for use those books which would, in my 
judgment, best secure both uniformity and efficiency. This action was stated in 
a circular letter to all Superintendents. Their names and addresses were printed 
for the benefit of publishers. . 
The correspondence on the subject has been considerable; some valuable and 
critical opinions have been presented. I should have been pleased with more, 
In reference to some subjects, the diversity of opinion has been great. 
After careful consideration, therefore, with the exception above mentioned, I 
hereby announce as selected for use in the free schools of the State, the following

STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Orrics SurerinrenvEeNT Pusiic Insrrucrion, 
Nasuvinuz, December 4th, 1868, 
To the Boards of School Directors :— 
Blanks for the preliminary reports of Clerks of the Civil Districts, are now in 
your hands—delays and enquiries make it necessary for me to address you, These 
blanks indicate something of the various and important responsibilities resting 
upon yours Board, with reference to the youth of your District. Be not troubled ~ 
by their scope; the benevolent soul loves responsibility. Giancing: at the items 
included, you will see something of how, in the system of free schools, under the 
direction of the State, numerous agencies perform their part, each recognizing and 
co-operating with the other—none in conflict. 
A free State, as a governmental organization, neither exists solely by the agency 
of any particular class, nor for its exclusive benefit, but through the instrumen- 
tality of all its faithful citizens, and-for the benefit of all whether faithful or un- 
faithful. The object of its existence, is the welfare of the public, which is inelu-
-P-A-G-E-184
XXVIII 
sive of the personal good of every individual. The people provide, in the law 
certain methods of securing these results, These laws indicate those rights an 
privileges of the individual which are inalienable, and can neither be infringed Db; 
any or all other persons, and regulate all those rights and privileges which ar 
subordinated to the public welfare. Those elements of human nature which ren 
der society unendurable, where no government exists, are subject to modification. 
may be increased or may be diminished. Governments require men, as officers 
and money, collected by taxes, as revenue; and as these elements of evil increase, 
the expense of enforcing law is multiplied; as they are reduced, that expense cor- 
respondingly diminishes. The period in which these elements of evil Auman na- 
ture are susceptible of the most rapid change, is childhood and youth. 
The State recognizes this fact; sees that it is cheaper to educate than to punish, 
and whatever it does to train its youth aright, is most productive of material 
wealth, as wellas of inteligence, virtue, and refinement, without which, wealth is 
impossible. .An Astor, with all his possessions, in the midst of the kingdom of 
Dahomey, would be worse than penniless, The skill in the minds of the people, 
and not the richness of the soil they possess, makes the State opulent, 
The training of youth, therefore, which prevents crime, and cheapens the expense 
of government, and makes persons and society more virtuous and happy, and 
gives wealth to individuals and to the State, is fundamental, underlying all other 
concerns of the State, and of the utmost importance. In no direction does the 
State require greater wisdom than in devising and executing the system and 
measures by which this is to be assured. The history of man’s development from 
time immemorial, all philosophy and all experiences in education, should be laid 
under contribution. 
Our country presents excellent models—millions have wrought upon them for 
the past centuries; Tennessee seeks the best. Like those model systems and 
measures, hers recognizes the principle that the property of the State, receiving 
its value from the intelligence and virtue of the people, should educaie the children 
of the State, that what the State does, should be free, equal, and universal. Its 
methods and measures, its officers and their duties, are provided by State enact 
ment. It attemps this responsibility only with reference to the children, in that 
formative period, between six years and twenty years of age. You are required 
to take an enumeration of them in your District, The State levies a general tax, 
which, when collected, is to be apportioned pro rata among the scholastic population 
thus reported to this office. Its disbursement is to be conditioned on the compli- 
ance with the law in each District. Free Schools are to be furnished all these 
children five months each year. It is not intended the State fund shall pay the 
entire salary of the teachers, and you are authorized to levy a tax for the balance 
in the District. 
The school-house, its site and furniture, are vested in you as a corporate body 
of the District, andinirusted to your care. They are paid for by a tax.on the Dis- 
trict, voted by the electors. The Civil District is treated as a town incorporated 
for school purposes. . 
You have been selected because of your fitness for these duties; you have taken 
an oath to discharge them, It has. been a source of inexpressible satisfaction in 
organizing our Free Schools, to know that many men, most eminent for ability, 
learning and character, members of the learned professions, Judges of the Courts, 
Presidents of the Colleges, and others, who allow themselves to participate in pub- 
lie affairs in no other way, have generously, without compensation, earnestly un-
-P-A-G-E-185
  XXIX 
dertaken the fundamental work of the Boards of Directors. These blanks provide 
for an account of this great stewardship, Form No, 19 is intended to enable you 
to give a complete account of the scholastic population you have previously re- 
ported. The teacher keeps a register on his desk, from which he makes to you on 
the blanks furnished him, a report of the enrollment and attendance of the pupils, 
and the studies they pursue; you have space also for those benefited by instruction 
in private institutions of learning, and for those defective by nature, such as the 
blind, who can only be trained in schools or asylums conducted or specially ar- 
ranged for them; also space for the number attending no school. 
These are naturally divided into the employed and unemployed. The State may 
reckpn that all its children who attend any school are being improved, and that 
those who attend no school, but are employed, are gaining skill at industry. But 
the unemployed will be busy with some mischief, and may soon be counted in the 
class arraigued for crime. 
You may not be able to give the exact figures in regard to crime, either the, num- 
ber of individuals arraigned, or the cost of courts, fees, and other-expenses of de- 
tecting and punishing crime, or to set down exactly the amount of property destroy- 
ed by crime, but an estimate can be given closely approximating the exact amounts, 
and presenting an interesting comparison between the cost of crime and the cost of 
education. 
Form No. 20, calls for a detailed statement of the school money and property un- 
der your direction, The County Superintendent is the only officer in the county 
specially under bonds for safe-keeping of school moneys, and therefore receives 
and disburses all for the county, whether raised by Jocal or State tax. But you are 
responsible for the disbursement of all received by your district from the State, or 
raised by its own taxes. No financial statement ia to be included in this prelimin- 
ary report of transactions since the close of the fiscal year of the State, September 
30th. All the items in the other two blanks, should be brought up to the close of 
the report, even'if the schools have but just opened; that fact, the name of the 
teacher; and the number of pupils, can be given. 
Form No..21, calls for valuable miscellaneous items. 
All copies of the School Laws, notwithstanding ten thousand of the first were 
reported to me as published by the Legislature, have for some time, been exhausted. 
A new supply has been ordered, together with various forms for the guidance of 
school officers, This, it is hoped, will answer a multitude of inquiries and facili- 
tate work, A clear undersatnding of the system of free schools will relieve its 
introduction of many embarrassments. Once known, and its value tested, no 
other system of education isso great a favorite. Its introduction requires study, 
labor, patience and sacrifice. Ignorance is always opposed to improvement. In 
addition, we have to encounter all the evils left behind by the late civil convulsions. 
The notions and prejudices of the past are busy with misrepresentations and ob- 
Jections. Every valuable principle in the free school system is attacked. It is 
charged with elevating one class over another, and at the same time opposed ke- 
cause it provides equally for cach child, no more for the rich than poor. In the 
same breath, it is declared expensive, and its schools slurred as pauper schools. 
It is pronounced a sham; the management of its funds by the State, a cheat. The 
old system of so-called free schools is admitted a failure, and the new system 
charged with all its faults, If you will, for a moment, compare what Commis- 
sioners did then, and what you are expected to do now; the difference between 
the two systems will be sufficiently manifest. Who can now tell how the money of
-P-A-G-E-186
XXX 
asingle year was then expended? Or the simple fact of how many at'ende 
school in any one year? You will bear testimony that the work imposed on yo 
is nosham. Some may desire compensation for it, but the best educational system 
have always found some choice spirits in each district sufficiently interested in it 
welfare to perform the work gratuitously. Tennessee cannot be an exception in] 
this respect, 
The more fairly every feature of the system is tried, the better judgment can be 
formed of it. The provision of the school-house, and the employment of the 
teachers, are most important duties devolved upon the District, A small Manual 
of Architecture, giving full, but simple directions for the erection of school-houses, 
the best adapted to our wants of any that I know of, I have been able, by the 
kindness of General Howard, to procure fram the Bureau of R. F. & A. L., and 
have distributed it widely through the State. Iam happy to.hear of neat school- 
houses being erected on its models. Neatness and taste may cost nothing, but add 
unspeakably to the place where the characters of the young are to be moulded. 
Every school-house should be ¢omfortable. There should be nothing about it to 
imperil the health or lives of the children. A seat too high, so as to let the feet of 
the scholars dangle in mid air without resting properly on the floor, may make 
them lame for life; or benches without backs.may give them crooked spines, from 
which they can never recover, 1 
Land is abundant, and ‘the grounds shound be ample and healthful. It is grati- 
fying to know of the many generous spirits.in the State who appreciate this, and 
- have given whole sites for their Districts. “You should be careful to see that the 
law is fully executed, and the title vested in your Board. Many school-houses 
have been lost to the State on account of neglect on this point. The earlier you 
have a good school-house for your District, aud your school has’ a habitation, the 
sooner one of the great difficulties in your way will be overcome. Each year after, 
you will not. have to run about and worry, about finding a place for the school, bat 
the house will be ready, and you have only to open it and the school goes in. 
The qualifications of teachers are determined by the County Superintendent. Do 
not urge him to certify that a person is qualified who is not. A poor school teacher 
is dear at any price. Think, for the time being, he is put in the place of the parent 
‘in respect to every child in the District! . What a delicate and important responsi- 
bility! It-has passed into a maxim, “Like teacher, like school!” ‘The teacher 
should be in all respects, what you would have your best children be. When you 
have thus employed your teacher, you should frequently visit the school, and get 
the parents throughout the District to do so, and encourage and sustain him. The 
sentiments of the home and of the community have much to do with the work of the 
school. No pains should be spared to secure the regular and punctual attendance 
of every chiid in the District at school. The County Superintendents should have 
your hearty co-operation in all their endeavors to secure the execution of the law 
and advance the educational interests of the county. Their labors have been most 
arduous and trying; they have been messengers of good for the children. Not a 
free schoot in the State has been opened without their efforts ; their. compensation 
is exceedingly moderate, compared with what similar services command in other 
pursuits. 
Your attention is especially called to the importance of County Teachers’ Asso- 
ciations, and other meetings for the presentation and discussion of educational sub- 
“jects, What could be more healthful or beneficial than turning the attention in 
every community, to the improvement of the children?

To thé Pupils in the Free Schools of Tennessee: 
My Young Frienps:—TIt would give me great pleasure to visit you. The pro- 
vision 6f schools for you has been for the past year, the object of my cares and 
toils, Tam most anxious that you should have a good school, and that you should 
make the most of it. “1 hope you have a good teacher anda pleasant house; but 
these are nol proof against pupils misusing their privileges. Some of you are just 
entering upon your school years; others, just closing your school days, and must 
assume the duties of manhood and womanhood. No one of you can too highly 
prize the days of school as they pass. You cannot afford to lose a day, or to be 
latea moment, Punctuality and regularity of habits will save-you much in future 
life. A day lost may deprive you of the very lesson on which your success may 
sometime turn, Take care of the minutes, and the hours will take care of them- 
selves, Do riot expect excellence without labor. What costs us most, we prize 
highest.” There is no royal road to learning. Do not expect to ascend the hill of 
science without climbing. It is not enough to see, or hear, or.speak, or reckon, or 
write; you should do each accurately, Seek perfection in each by practice. Have 
method in your studies. The order and. arrangement of the school will aid you in 
this, Do noduty by halves. Go whole-souled into every requirement of the school. 
Do not go'over subjects of study, but through them. Be thorough. Not only re- 
member, but understand, and be able to communicate to others. Concentrate your 
attention, and give it undividedly and closely to whatever subject your teacher 
directs it. : 
Talk of your studies at home, and get the aid of your parents and older brothers 
and sisters, in understanding them. 
When your school closes, do not lay by your books to mould; but keep fresh in 
mind what you learn now, and be ready, if possible, to take up ‘the work next term 
where you leave it this. 
Aim high in all you do. Neither speak nor acta lie. Never utter 9 profane or 
vulgar word. In your conduct, remember the Golden Rule: be kind to all, and 
render a cheerful obedience to your teacher and your parents. Something is 
wrong if these relations are unpleasant, and you should seek to correct it. What- 
ever is right, is honorable, —that is, worthy to be honored; have the courage to be 
right, 
The order of nature, the laws of the State, and the opinions and customs of
-P-A-G-E-188
XXXIT 
society, have put the mature judgments of teachers and parents in the place of the 
inexperienced judgments of the young, for their guidance. Your reasonable acqui- 
escence in this, will prove your best means for making your own judgment habitu- 
ally prudent and wise, as well as be your best aid in securing the submission of 
your impulses and will to your own convictions of duty, when you no longer have 
teachers and parents to advise and direct you, 
Avoid.bad company; familiarize your mind with the lives and characters of those 
who have been benefactors of their race. 
Store your memory with useful knowledge, especially with the choicest precepts. 
This care of your life will not destroy its pleasures or hasten your oldage. Pru- 
ning the tree neither destroys it, nor dries up its sap, but adds vigor to its growth, 
and beauty and grace to its appearance. The rose becomes, by culture, more at- 
tractive in variety aud beauty and flavor. 
Seek the best gifts, and may God speed you in securing them.

STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Orrick SurERinzENDuXT PuBiic InsTRUGTION, 
Nasuvitiz, December 10th, 1868. 
To the County Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
For the County of- 
Srr :—There seems, by the numerous inquiries, to be some misunderstanding in 
regard to the drawing of the apportionment of forty-eight and seven hundredths 
cents to the individual, of the scholastic population, made and announced last Sum- 
mer. All benefit from the School Law is conditioned on compliance with it. All 
civil districts that complied with the law, so as to secure its benefits and opened 
their schools in the last fiscal year—thatis, before the close of September last,— 
should at once draw for the amount due them, by filing the requisitions herewith 
sent, Each requisition should be made ouf and signed in duplicate; and each 
Treasurer's receipt signed in duplicate, also. One requisition is retained in this 
office as my voucher; the other goes to the Comptroller to secure his Warrant; 
and the Treasurer’s receipts are filed as vouchers in the offices of the Treasurer 
and Comptroller, respectively. No school moneys are held in this office. I do not 
receive them. The Treasurer is charged with the custody, as he is with all other 
State moneys, I can approve only such requisitions on the School moneys as the 
Jaw allows. 
The blanks are exactly conformed to the requirements of law, save in the 
exceptions named in the law, and which could not well be inserted in the requisition, 
Look carefully at the certificate. The population on which you draw is the enu- 
meration for 1867, The exceptions to the certificate, are cases in which the colored 
scholastic population does not exceed twenty-five, and in which the average at- 
fendanee of a colored school falls below fifteen, for any one month, and is discon- 
‘inued,  
-P-A-G-E-189
SXX0T 
The law is our guide. We must seek its faithful execution, Iam gratified at 
the effort I witness among the County Superintendents to administer it faithfully. 
Any effort to prevert it should be carefully guarded against.’ No personal interest 
should be allowed to harm the public welfare. The difficulties in your way are 
great. They are the more trying because often so unnecessary. False reports and 
personal interferences should not disturb your patience. 
Follow closely the law and the instructions, and you will find your work soon 
yielding abundant proof of its excellence. Unfortunately, I often get many in- 
quiries from Superintendents after the questions have been carefully answered in 
cireulars or letters. I invite, therefore, close attention to all points on which any 
communication is made. This will save you much inconvenience, and me great 
labor. | ‘ : 
Do not let your mind be disturbed by the advice of men opposed to free educa- 
tion, or opposed to a faithful execution of the law, or disposed to thrust ia your 
way their personal interests, I hear of persons traveling about and under various 
pretenses, interfering with the execution of the law and instructions from this 
ofice. The yielding to any of these untoward influences will render county and 
all supervision useless, or injurious, as now charged by those who would abolish it 
altogether in our State. Whereas, every one’s faithful discharge of his duty in 
accordance with ihe law and instructions given him, will secure'an excellence of 
results that neither ignorance nor self-interest, nor villainy, can successfully assail, 
We have in our hands a beautiful germ of a great system of education, that may 
bear fruit for the good of coming generations; its success depends first and es- 
sentially upon the State Superintendent and County Superintendents. Having 
appointed you to your posts, I shall feel keenly any injury that may come through 
your act as well as through mine, 
The Preliminary Report is not intended to be a complete annual report. It is 
expected only to give the condition of the work so far as it has already progressed. 
The particularity-of its blanks leaves little room for misunderstanding what is ex- 
pected. It will be seen that they begin with Form No. 19, and proceed continu- 
ously, according to the blanks furnished Clerks of Districts, item corresponding to 
item, until the “Summary from Superintendent’s Records” is reached, when 
your office should furnish what is required. The number of districts and of teach- 
ers, ete, provided for on different pages, is equal to the number in most counties. 
Additional pages were printed for those counties that may require more, and will 
be sent as the Superintendents give me notice of the pages and number they re- 
quire. | 
It is excéedingly important that the reports should be made out promptly as 
possible. Few counties can now give all the items; but every Superintendent 
should fill the report as far as possible, and send one copy to this office, and retain 
the other on file in his office, for the use of the county. 
Simply making out these reports will be found » great educational measure, of 
‘value in every county.and district. 
Very respectfully, yours, -ete., 
JOHN EATON, Jz, 
Superintendent Public Instruction.

Rev. E. 0, Tanz, Superintendent Public Instruction, Hamilion County : 
Dear Sizn:—Your several letters are received. I rejoice in your educational 
labors and zeal, and in the fact that you have found so many tosecond your efforts. 
It would give me great pleasure to comply with your invitation to be with you at 
your meeting, but I am at present utterly unable to answer the numerous demands 
with being in many places at the same time. Your inquiries about the State School 
Fund are like those from all quarters of the State. The educational fund, as you 
know, has not yet come under my supervision; indeed, the State has not yet paid 
the postage for this office, What shall be the means for schools in the future, is 
for the Legislature to determine. Will they pass such amendments to the school 
Jaw as will make it successful in its operation? Will they so regulate the finances 
of the State by the sale of railroads, and the increase of the revenue, as to enable 
the State to pay to each place its proportion of the school money after that has 
been ascertained and becomes due? 
I think they will, They have such measures now before them. No one has the 
power, not even the Legislature, to divert a cent of school money to any other pur- 
pose. The Constitution is very specific on this point. Our State Government has 
labored under untold embarrassments, but has nobly risen above them all. Its re- 
organization is based on those principles which recognize universal education as 
essential to the security of our institutions. Every public man is committed to 
these principles, Every school enforces them. They will grow with the growth of 
the State. The peace of communities, the skill of industry, the profits of com- 
merce depends upon them. The purpose of your meeting looks to their success.

Every county should be a centre of influence, contributing to their advancemen 
There is room and work for all. Every high quality is laid under contributio: 
especially, are wisdom and patience. 
What is to be done now is of the nature of Isying the foundation, A 
approaching the first works on a bridge, as that now being erected over 
Louisville, sees nothing for months, perhaps, but structures for defending ..-.-—_ 
from the water, and machinery for excavation down deep out of sight, the work 
men remove rubbish, lay the foundation for the piers sure beyond all contingency. 
Slowly each stone goes into its place, every stroke of the hammer and chisel tells, 
till with patience, time and wisdom, the work rises to view, and at last the span is 
thrown across and becomes the thoroughfare of travel.and commerce, and attracts 
the admiration of all beholders. The engineer saw the work from the beginning. 
His plan was complete at the start. Neither he nor the workmen faltered because 
others did not understand or appreciate—nor must we. If the duties imposed are 
great and trying, the results, we may he sure, will be commensurate. They will 
last when the hills have passed away. What others may say will not change the 
movement or our endeavors. 
The work of instruction is the calling of angels. Indeed, every instructor has 
as an example—the Great Teacher. Deity has not despised the profession, and men 
will everywhere honor it in dua time,

Meeting of the Board of School Fund Commissioners. 
  
Knoxvitiz, March 24th, 1868, 
The Board of Commissioners of the School Fund met upon the call of the Presi- 
dent. ‘ 
Present: W. G. Brownlow, Governor; John’ Henry, State Treasurer; and 
John Eaton, Jr.; Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
Absent: A.J. Fletcher, Secretary of State; and George W. Blackburn, Comp- 
troller. . 
A dispatch was read from Mr. Blackburn, stating that he could not be present. 
The laws constituting the Board and defining its duties were carefully examined, 
also the Comptroller's statemént of the condition of the School Fund. 
The Superintendent of Instruction stated facts in regard to the organization of 
free schools, and the immediate demand for funds to pay services as rendered, and 
the duty devolved upon the Board of ascertaining the exact condition of the entire 
fund. The Governor suggested that an immediate call should be made upon the 
Board having in charge the finances of the State. The Treasurer communicated 
facis in regard to the present condition of the School Fund. 
On motion, it was unanimously 
Resolved, That the Board of Commissioners of the Schoo! Fund, having before them the evi- 
dence as furnished by the Comptroller’s Report of the indebtedness of the State to the School 
Fund to the amount of one million and five hundred thousand dollars, ($1,500,000,) more or 
Jess, call upon the Board of Finance to provide, without delay, two hundred thousand doilars 
($200,000) for immediate expenditure in payment of services of Teachers and Superintendents 
Tendered, and to be rendered. 
On motion, the following was unanimously adopted: 
Wuerzas, This Board is charged with the “superintendence of the School Fund,” and is 
required to guard it against diminution, and see that the fund for annual distribution shail be 
inviolably paid over tothe support of Common Schools, for the benefit of all the people, as provided for by this Act and no other use, and Wuereas, It is also-provided ‘that there shall be kept in the office of the State Treasurer 
andjComptroller a separate account of ull school moneys received and disbursed, and that all 
moneys collected for school purposes, shall be set apait and expended for those and no other 
purposes ;** therefore, 
Resolved, That this Board deem it essential to the discharge of its-duties that the respective 
officers in charge of school moneys comply with the exact terms of. the law, and hereby spe- cially invite their attention to the same. 
On motion, the Board adjourned.

Q. 
Address of the State Teachers’ Association to the Governor, Legislature 
and People of Tennessee: 
Assembled in Convention, at Lookout Mountain, for the purpose of promoting 
the cause of Popular Education—having listened to addresses and discussions, and 
taken counsel together as citizens and friends of this good cause—we desire res- 
pectfully to submit to your notice the results of our deliberations, and ask of you a 
candid and thoughiful hearing. Though representing, as we believe, almost every 
shade of political sentiment, yet it has not been as partisans that we have met, nor 
as such would we presume to address you; but from a nobler and better position 
would we speak. Anxious only for the highest welfare of our people, and the best 
interest of our beloved Commonwealth—encouraged by the general and increasing
-P-A-G-E-200
XLIV 
interest already manifested in this cause, and cheered by the sure promises of suc- 
cess which have ever attended faithful and disinterested effort in this direction, 
we would lay before you in brief the convictions which have prompted us in our 
endeavors, trusting that they will commend themselves to your judgment and 
hearty approval. 
We believe that the cause of Common School Education, or education for the 
masses of our people, is bound up in all the highest and best interests of the State 
—that a calm and comprehensive view of this matter will invariably lead to this 
conclusion. This is and ever has been the result of much thought given to it by 
the ablest minds of the nation, and history, the revered chronicler of the past, con- 
firms it with her thousand testimonials. 
It has been found to be true, in the language of Edmund Burke, “that Educa- 
tion is the cheap defense of nations;” that no police expenditures are so judicious 
and effective as those of an educational character; that “prevention is better than 
cure;” and that if we would diminish crime and pauperism, and the attendant bur- 
dens of taxation, wo must educate with greater care, the masses of our people. 
Statistics very clearly show that school houses are much less expensive in the end 
than pauper houses; that school teachers and school books cost much less than 
jails and penitentiaries and criminal courts; and a considerate people, it would 
seem, will not fail to act accordingly. 
We believe, also, that education is one of the most prolific sources of wealth among 
a people; that, as Chief Justice Chase has remarked, “that power created by edu- 
cation, and made available in all forms.of labor, and in all processes of arts and 
science, * * ° * is worth many times its cost.” An intelligent people are a 
thrifty people, It is this which sets all the wheels of ingenuity and enterprise in 
motion—which stirs the mind with new activities and inventions, and enables it to 
unfold new projects, and lay a firm grasp upon all the resources of nature and art. 
It is moreover the case, that a thorough and general system of popular educa- 
tion in a State becomes strangely attractive to immigration. Experience has long 
since proved that, however poor and humble he may be, the new comer to our 
shore is generally very thoughtful in this, and such do not, and will not, go in any 
numbers to those States which deal with a slack hand in éducational matters, So 
long as the parental instinct is alive, just so long will the desire for the education 
of the child and his rise in the world be deep and operative; and all the inven- 
tions, and immigration societies and boards in the world, cannot change this thing. 
But let this matter be wisely and practically settled as one feature of the perma- 
nent policy of the State, and its fayorable influence will become more and more 
apparent, 
It is furthermore to be remembered that in our day the educational character 
ofa State has much, very much, to do with the good name and credit of the State. 
This no well informed person will deny. Capitalists discern with eagle eyes the 
bearings of these things. The connection of bankruptcy with ignorance, and 
thriftlessness, and lawlessness, and crime, is seen to be very natural and logical, 
and it is vain to attempt to deceive any one in these things. Our reputation as a 
State in the financial markets of the couniry, is a matter which it becomes us to 
guard with much jealousy and care, and very few things, it is believed, are © better 
fitted to give confidence in our future than this. 
With these views of the situation, we would respectfully urge upon the avo citi- 
zens of the State, a thoughtful and judicious regard for all our school interests, 
We earnestly hope that no suggestions or propositions of any backward movement
-P-A-G-E-201
XLV 
will be seriously entertained, and that no ideas of that character will meet with 
any favor. Every wise and true man must see that any movement in that direc- - 
tion will be alike deeply injurious to our welfare and prosperity at homé, and to 
our interests and good name abroad. We greatly desire that our honored and be- 
loved Commonwealth may move steadily forward in the pathway of peace, prosper- 
ity and true greatness; and it.is our profound conviction that this end cnn only be 
attained by fostering .with a kindly care the public schoo) system which has been 
adopted, and improving and strengthening it by such amendments from time to 
time, a8 experience may suggest. The results already attained, as seen in the ac- 
companying statistics of the Superintendent of Publi¢ Instruction, have satisfied us 
that in its main features it is most excellent, and compares favorably with similar 
statistics in the States of the Union. We believe that its financial provisions, if 
left undisturbed, will prove in a few years, to be ample for all legitimate school 
purposes. We are of opinion that the system has already obtained a hold upon the 
hearts of the people, with which it would be unwise to interfere. In the slight 
modifications which we suggest, our only desire isto. increase’ its efficiency, and 
make it more fully promotive of its great and noble purpose. 
Experience thus far goes to show that much difficulty would be avoided by the 
abolition of the sub-district system, and the incorporation of the regular school 
district, for legitimate school purposes only. Let all school funds of the State be 
held sacred for school purposes, and no other, and the strictest economy be ob- 
served in all educational matters. 
In making this appeal to our fellow-citizens, we beg to assure them that we seek 
alone the public good, and we earnestly hope that it will be met by a spirit as can- 
did and conciliating as that. in which it is presented, We believe that the storm- 
clouds which have overshadowed our State are fast passing away, and that our 
future is bright and cheering. Prompted, as we trust, by enlarged views of public 
policy, and guided by the wise experience of the past, we would go forward in the 
high pathway of national progress and honor, and we ask the steadfast co-opera- 
tion.of the wise and true men of this Commonwealth in the good work which is 
before us.

SPEECH OF REV. DR. SEARS. 
At the session of the State Teachers’ Association on Wednesday evening, Dee. 
80, 1868; Rev. Bannas Sears, D. D., Agent of the Peabody Fund, spoke in substance 
ag follows: . 
I know from your countenances that you want me to make a practical instead of 
an eloquent speech, and I shall doit. I shall choose as my subject the observations
-P-A-G-E-202
XLVI 
of my experience through the country. The want at the present time is a free sys 
tem of the Public Schools. This want, I find, is universal. This country canno 
prosper till education becomes universal. All must receive it. If it is worth any: 
thing to any mind, it is to every mind. Ido not say that all men have the same| 
natural ability, or that every person could be made an able man by education; but 
Imean to say that all should have the privilege of education.’ It is often the case 
that many of the strongest minds amount to nothing for want of it; and to-day we 
might have more able men in our country if education had been more universal. 
And why is there such indifference to this matter, when every cultivated mind 
helps society so much? Our country cannot afford to lose so many great minds 
that we hear nothing of. She could have more if all had the same advantages. 
Then I beg of you to encourage universal education. It is for your interest—-it is 
for the interest of us all. 
We may say that Providence has-distributed the great minds almost equally over 
the world. Every nation is made great by its leading men, and these men we can- 
not lay aside any more than the Greeks and Romans could their great men. 
Why should not nations look as much to their intellectual as their physical treas- 
ures? A country that abounds in intellect is greater than a wealthy country. 
Look over the nations that have made their mark in history. They are not found 
ia the plains of Asia, but where they have worked for advancements for the educs- 
tion of the masses, What made Holland, England and France so great? It was 
not their geographical position, but it was their effort to produce men. They edu- 
cated everybody; worked their whole material, and from it selected the best for 
leaders. We find the want of universal education in the comparison of England 
and Prussia, The former has had all the means she could wish to carry on her 
schools, yet the masses have not received the benefits of it, and as a consequence 
are in a most degraded condition. In some places it has produced great men. There 
is here a radical defect in the method of education. Prussia has not expended so 
much money as England. It has really been a poor country, and yet her people 
everywhere are enlightened. In our own country we seo how one system has 
proved a failuure and the other a success. It is the public schools that make edu- 
cation universal—their advantages reach everybody. The private schools may do 
much good, but you can’t rely on them to educate the masses. Neither can you 
expect much from charitable institutions. There is a self-respect that prevents 
many from sending their children to such schools. Many parents desire that their 
children should be kept from the society of children, and especially from that of 
the lower class, Here they commit a great error. By working together there is 
that interest created and preserved which there would not be if they were alone. 
They make acquaintances and establish friendship which they keep forever. They 
go forth into active life together, as brothers; the different elements are thus har- 
monized and greatly contribute to the prosperity of the whole. The private schools 
are unsuited to the demands of the people; they throw away half the power—they 
throw away half the money. If all the means which is consumed by the private 
schools was given to the support of the public schools, the best school buildings 
could be provided and the best teachers secured. The character of each system is 
greatly different. 
Education is the end of the publicschools. What is the end of private schools? 
They are institutions that bring in personal, pecuniary interest, just as that of a 
railroad. The business of the private school teacher is to make a. living. He re- 
ceives pupils of every grade—the only qualification he requires is the ability to pay
-P-A-G-E-203
XLVII 
the tuition, He has no system of gradation in the school—he can have none—for 
scholars of every age, of every degree of advancement are admitted to his school, 
He must teach them one by one. The private schools are really nothing but strag- 
gling armies, 
Tfind, in traveling through the country, that what schools need very much is 
more scholars. -With a larger number, those not fitted for it could be transferred 
and enough would remain. In a town of but eight or ten schools I find there are 
seldom but one or two graded, and only by being graded can they succeed, 
Besides, I believe that teachers are too often transferred from grade to grade. It 
is much better for the school to have the same teacher all the time. If he desires 
promotion let hig salary be raised, and I know he will be satisfied. 
It is surprising to find so few schools‘in the South. I have visited eleven States, 
and I regret to say that not one-third of the children are being educated, and yet 
the expense is more than it need be to furnish education to ali. In atown in Ar- 
kansas, the leading men there most interested in education met together and formed 
an estimate of the expense of private schools, This was over seven thousand dol. 
lars, It was found that half of this was sufficient to maintain free schools for all, 
By the Free School system all the children of any State could be educated for less 
than half the sum required to maintain private schools, and it is very singular why 
the people are not more willing to adopt it in the South. The private school system 
then, I say, is wasteful in money, is wasteful in energy, and should be dispensed 
with, The public schools are graded, Every teacher has just such scholars and 
justas many as he should. They are under the control of directors who are educated. 
men, and who give their entire attention to the interests of the schools. I find the 
only objection raised to the schools is that the people don’t like the auspices under 
which they are controlled, They don’t like the antecedents of the teachers ; in 
short, they don’t like their polities. My advice to the teacher has always been to 
have no politics ina partisan sense. I am often asked what my polities are. I 
tell them Iam a progressive conservative. Conservative of everything that has 
stood the trial of experience, and progressive in everything that promises improve- 
ment,” 
The public system of education must have sympathy. Only by cominon interest 
and co-operation can it succeed. The work of education must grow, like a tree; 
you cannot build it, like a housé, It must have the means of growth. It must 
have confidence, generosity. If you find some defect in it, remove that, and not 
the system. To oppose the system because some features of it may seem objection« 
able, would be like cutting down an apple tree because some of its limbs were de- 
cayed. As with the tree, so with the system, Prune it cautiously. Cut off its 
dead limbs. That part which has been successful should be adhered to. Don’t 
throw it away, 
Pardon me, ladies and gentlemen, for speaking so. practically, but I have done 
as I promised you at the commencement. 
Ss. . 
The following memoranda of Dr. Sears’ address taken from the newspapers of 
the date will be specially valued as the sentiments which direct the disbursements 
of this Fund for Southern Education: 
The address, from want of preparation, was of a conversational rather than formal character. 
He held that the success of an educational system depends upon the union of ideas and 
events. Theory or an ideal view of all subjects, social, scientific or political was necessary to
-P-A-G-E-204
XLVIIL 
all progress. It sets before the mind a goal to be reached, and keeps it pressing straight for. 
ward to a given end. The importance of this speculative philosophy as applied to the practi 
eal problems of life, could not be questioned. ‘But when trusted to exclusively, it has two o 
three very serious drawbacks, which could not be overlooked. We live ina world where we 
are surrounded by mysteries. There is much that we cannot know entirely. Ail knowledge| 
is imperfect; of speculative knowledge this is especially true. Theories leave out of account 
civcumstances and events which often modify and overthrow them. Not every measure which 
ig wise in itself is successful, Accidents, unforeseen and unexpected, arise and grow into con- 
trolling forces. Again, theories may be only plausible, only right in theory, and when applied 
to the practical affairs in life, may be found to be utterly faulty. Natural objections and social 
prejudices are often overlooked, which, in the end, set aside and overthrow systems which are 
theoretically correct. : 
Again, a proper equipoise is necessary. One system like the French philosophy will hurl a 
nation into chaos and ruin. Another follows in the footsteps of our forefathers, satisfied with 
ideas and systems centuries old, and is so slow as to defeat all progress. . 
The English Constitution was much to be admired, but there were those who thought it too 
slow. On the other hand there were many who.thought.the French philosophy too fast. There 
should be a combination of the two systems of thought and action. One is a proper cheek 
upon the other. 
All these things apply to school legislation. The fundamental maxim is, that évery step of 
progress must be taken so slowly that it shall be permanent. There should be no step back- 
ward. There is nothing so discouraging in social progress as fluetuation. 
"The State that makes one grand mistake in establishing an educational systen, postpones 
the subject for a generation. There is nothing which requires more care. Public confidence is 
easily destroyed. He had had several years’ experience on the point, and his success was due 
to the co-operation of wise men who gaid that no step should he taken that would have to be 
retraced. Steady progress begets confidence. You gain much if youcan show a series of 
years in which no great mistakes have been made. Of course mistakes cannot always be 
avoided. We must always learn by experience. The light of experience shines but a little way into the future; theory looks far into the distance, We should go-only so faras the two 
can be united. Every step should be taken in the light of experiments on a small seale, 
The speaker then proceeded to speak of the importance of a system of universal education. 
However it might have been in other times and in other countries, we now live in a crisis in 
the history of education. This necessity cannot be ignored or escaped, We are borne on by 
a current of events which cannot be res‘sted. Free labor demands free thought; free thought 
demands intelligence, and no’ system of education which overlooks this requirement, ean 
stand for any length of time. There is no way but to meet it squarely, and at once. Industry 
has changed its form, and there is a demand that it should be intelligen & There is no demand 
more imperative in respect to the progress of this and other commonwealths. Intelligent la- 
boris what is wanted, Weelive in an age when industry is under the dominion of science. In traveling through our State, he had: looked with admiration and wonder upon its Tesources, 
agricultural and mineral, but he thought he could see that all this could benefit the State but 
little, without the intelligence and skill necessary to develop them. There must be machinery, and it must be placed imder'the control of skillful hands and intelligent brains. He regarded it as an axiom that the development of the mental resources of a State, is necessary to the de- 
velopment of its ‘physical resources. 
Could anything be plainer than that the amount that a man shall receive should be measured, 
not by the strength of his muscle, but by the intelligence which resides within him ? Young 
men had often applied to him for assistance in starting in life, and his invariable reply had 
been, ‘Deserve the first place, and nobody can keep you out of it.” When we employ a man, 
we pay for the qualities. of his mind, and not his muscle. 
But there can not be universal education without a system of free public schools.- Private 
schools can not reach all the people. They can.not miake provision for all the people, neither 
ean they obtain their attendance. Private schools are monéy-making affairs. They take the 
pupils that will pay, without reference to their advancement. Jn a private school everything 
depends upon the character of the man in charge. It may be successful one year, and fail the 
next, or itmay change hands. It is subject to the utmost fluctuation. This is so the world 
over. He said nothing in derogation of private schools; but they could not secure universal 
education. Educate a portion of the population, and you limit yourself to a fraction of the 
mental resources of the country. 
Observations in Europe, as well as America, had convinced him that the middle and lower classes have their fill share of energy and talent, ‘This energy and talent we cannot afford to 
acrifice ; ‘but they cannot be reached except by a system of free public schools.
-P-A-G-E-205

But it is objected that by this system the rich must educate the poor. Who is it that builds 
our railroads and harbors, and construets all our great improvements? Yet these are in the 
greatest degree a benefit to the poor, ‘The analogy of the human body holds good, the health of the-wholé depends upon the health of the parts. ‘The testimony of rich men was, that thay 
contd well afford to pay their tax for the support of schools. The value of property is en-- 
hanced by the intelligence of the community, its schools and churches. In the end, there will 
be no more ardent supporters of public schools and of a public tax for their support, than the 
heaviest tax payers. 
The speaker referred to the system pursued by the different States for raising funds for 
achool purposes. In some States this was done by a general State tax, and in others each lo- 
cality was left'to lay its own tax, and in others each locality was left to lay its own tax and manage its own schools. In Massachusetts each town votes its owntax. The system hag 
some advantages. 
It excites a healthy rivalry among neighboring towns, each trying to place its schools in ad- 
vance of others. Each town expends its money on its own children. and expends it under its 
own supervision and according to is own ideas, 
The speaker referred to the importance of a State department, under the control of a State 
officer, who should give his personal attention constantly to this one work. The suggestions 
of such a man, if competent to the position, would be of inestimable yalue to the Legislature 
of the State, in deliberating upon measures in, the interest of education. Others have not the 
means of juformation, and are not able to make themselves familiar with the condition and 
wants of the schools throughout the State. Legislation must be graded by the intelligence of 
the people. The people must be educated or legislation will. be dragged down to their level. 
Hence the importance of an intelligent public. 
The speaker dwelt at some length upon the absolnte necessity ‘of a State normal school or schools, 
The Prussians have a motto, “as is the teacher, so is the school,”, and no adage could be 
moreitrue, “It might be objected that it is expensive to employ a good teacher. True, but it 
is also expensivé to employ a good tailor, yet it is poor economy to let d poor one rein your 
cloth. No poor teacher was ever acheap teacher. A professional education for teachers was 
ag necessary. as for other professions. One skillful teachor will accomplish as much as ten 
poor ones. This had been demonstrated by experiment. In Massachusetts, atfirst there was 
a strong prejudice against normal schools, but the result of the experiment had been that nor- mal schoois could not furnish teachers fast enough to supply the demand made upon them,. 
The importance of having skillful-trained teachers can hardly be overestimated. It is a most 
difficult task to teach achild, much more difficult than to teach a class of college students, 
The teacher must understand the philosophy of the child's mind, and must adapt his inethod to the capacity, state of advancement, and cast of the mind of the child. 
To be sure all this would cost money, but so do railroads. It is not the amount of cost ‘that 
determines the judiciousness of an expenditure, but the relation of the expenditure to the.re- 
sult attained, . . 
The trustees of the Peabody fund had determined to devote the fund to the maintevance-of 
public free schools exclusively. They would not take from the people what properly be- 
longed to them, by establishing schools and assuming their control. It had ‘seemed to 
them best that the people should be left.to take all initiative steps to establish their sys- 
tem of public sehoois and have. entire control of them, and then aid would be. extended 
in whatever measure it could be given. 
The speaker concluded by expressing his gratification at the opportanity given him of 
addressing the Convention, since he wished them to know that they must take the initia- 
tive. He urged them to go forward and establish schools. “The work which they wished 
to aid was exactly the one which this Association and the. Legislature has in hand.

George Peabody.—His Career and his Benefactions—Charasteristic 
ecdotes —His Sojourn at the Springs—The Southern Education Fuuu. 
  
GREENBRIER, WarrE Sutpnur Springs, 
August 25th, 1869. } 
The presence of Mr. Pranopy within our borders for the first time since he be 
came specially eminent, suggests the thought that a brief review of the career and 
benefactions of that great philanthropist, together with some notice of his present 
sojourn at our favorite fountain, may prove inieresting. With this ideain view, we 
have, through the kindness of the relatives and friends of that gentleman who at~ 
tend him here, gained trustworthy information as to all the facts to which reference 
will be made: He, fortunately, needs no partial pen to impress the world with the 
greatness of its obligations to his benevolence. 
George Peabody comes of an ancient English family, settled in America as early 
as 1635, and was born in Danvers, Mass., on the 18th of February, 1795. He 
commenced business as a clerk ina store at the early age of eleven, and continued 
thus to serve in several places in New England, for six years. At the age of sev- 
enteen he formed a partnership in the drapery business, in Georgetown, D. C., with 
Mr. Elisha Riggs, who furnished a capital of $3, 000, young Peabody having the 
management: of the business. That this partnership was mutually satisfactory the 
following anecdote sufficiently proves: At ‘he time it was formed the age of his 
youthful partner, already six feet high’ and unusually mature in appearance, was 
unknown to Mr. Riggs, who, in conversation with him some time after its establish- 
ment, remarked that many men improperly entered business when too young, as- 
suming respousibilities for which their experieuce did not qualify them, etc. Mr. 
Peabody at the time made no reply, but, upon coming of age recurred to this re- 
mark of his associate, and informed him that though they had been in partnership 
nearly four years he was now only twenty-one. Mr. Riggs heard this with aston- 
ishment, but without complaint, and a few years after, upon the winding up of the 
concern, received $150,000 as his share of the profits on the original capital of three 
thousand. 
During his residence in Georgetown the war with Great Britain was going on, 
and the young merchant for a time became a soldier, serving in a volunteer artil- 
Jery company in defense of the capital, In 1815 the house of Riggs & Peabody was 
established in Baltimore. The style of the firm subsequently became Peabody, 
Riggs & Co., and branch houses were opened in New York and Philadelphia. In 
the year 1837, Mr. Peabody fixed his home in, London, where he has ever since re- 
sided, though still claiming to be a citizen of the United States. He has crossed 
the Atlantic fourteen times, and if his health permits, will next spring make his 
fifteenth passage. 
His business in London was that of a banker and commission agent, and his sa- 
gacity in all financial concerns was soon conspicuous. It seems only less wonder- 
ful than his liberality because it is oftener paralleled. The foundation of his for- 
tune, for example, is said to have been due to his extensive purchase during the 
crisis of 1885, of Maryland bonds, the Stat» being then in danger of repudiation— 
an act by which he saved her credit, and himself realized largely. He also ren- 
dered similar service subsequently to various States and corporations in America.  
-P-A-G-E-207
Ll 
Numerous railways in the United States are indebted to him for their speedy com- 
pletion ;. he supplying them with iron and taking their bonds in payment. In this 
way, while adding greatly to the wealth of his native land, he is understood to hav 
acquired no small part of his private fortune. © foe 
Mr. Peabody’s extraordinary liberality, if not before evinced, developed itself as 
early as 1851, when he assumed the entire expense of arranging the American de- 
partment in the Great Exhibition in London, and in 1852, when he gave $10,000 
to defray the cost of the second expedition in search of Sir John Franklin. The 
same ‘year he bestowed $20,000 (since increased tenfold)—his first educational 
grant—to found the Peabody Institute in his’ native town, then celebrating the 
centennial anniversary of its corporation. The Legislature of Massachusetts has 
recently changed the name of this town from Danvers to Peabody. It is, however, 
within eighteen years past, that his benevolence has been most striking. and what- 
ever may before have been the case, all that he has done in that time has not been 
the result of impulse, bat the carrying out of a pre-conceived plan. This is indi- 
cated by the following incident: . 
Mr. W. W. Corcoran, of Washington City, his friend for half a century, and a 
gentleman well known for his great wealth and numerous noble charities, had sig~ 
nalized himself by providing for the wants and transportation to the far West, of a 
large body of Hungarians who had just been landed ‘at New York in a state of 
utter destitution. Mr. Peabody, in a letter.from Loudon to Mr. Corcoran, dated 
October 8, 1851, uses the following language: —~ 
‘However liberal I may be, [cannot keep pace with your noble acts of charjty at home, but 
one of these days I mean to come out, and then, if my feelings regarding money don’t change, 
and Thave plenty, I shall become a strong competitor of yours in benevolence. * * * You acted nobly by the Hungarians,’ . 
How the pledge thus given has been redeemed, the world knows. The only 
change in his benevolent intentions regarding the United States, as then enter- 
tained, that is known to have taken place, is, that funds which were designed to ad- 
vance education in the whole country he has since the war devoted entirely to the 
South, His own words to a member of the Board of Trustees of the Southern Edu- 
cation Fund, on the occasion of his last great donation, were: ‘I do this for the 
South for the benefit of the whole country.” . 
Mr. Peabody is known to be charitable on principle, to recognize his obligations 
to God as having prospered him above others, and to consider himself merely a 
steward of his bounty. He says that he gives according to his means; that he 
does ro more, could do no less. Great, however, as is lis liberality, he never enter- 
tains applications for aid from strangers, and habitually declines to read or answer let- 
ters containing them. On one occasivn he committed to the flames as many as 4,000 
such letters, One of his most striking characteristics—more or less illustrated in 
every gift he has made—is a freedom from sectional or sectarian prejudice and 
bigotry ; a catholicity of spirit and Jarge hearted benevolence. He declares that 
he never has bestowed benefits upon any particular religious denomination as such, 
and that he never will do so, and he has distinctly expressed ‘the wish that this 
policy should obtain in the apportionment of the fuad for education in the South. 
He is not a member of any church, though educated a Presbyterian. 
The total amount he has given away inthe last seventeen years, is but little short 
of ten ruillions of dollars. His splendid gifts to the poor of London—about two 
millions of dollars in the aggregate—are still fresb in the minds of all, and the 
letter and miniature of herself sent him by the Queen everywhere remembered. 
A well-written and most interesting account of the manner in which this mouey
-P-A-G-E-208
LIT. 
has been bestowed is found in Appleton’s Journal for July 31, 1869. The city of 
Baltimore, for twenty years his home, has received for educational purposes, not 
less than a million of dollars. and the cause of southern education double as much- 
Most of his other donations in the United States have been in the North, chiefly 
New England, and are too numerous to detail here. He has distributed among his 
living relatives in America more than two millions of dollars, and has built in 
Georgetown, Mass., as a memorial to his mother, a new church at a cost of a hun- 
dred thousatid more. 
The first donation in behalf of southern education, made in 1866, was $1,000,000 
in cash and $1,000,000 in Mississippi State bonds. The second donation, made 
within the last eight weeks, was $1,000,000 in cash and $486,000 in Florida State 
bonds. The nominal amount, therefore, is more than $3,500,000, though only 
$2,000,000 are at present available. This is judiciously invested, and’yields an- 
nually about $180,000. . In special recognition of the former of these donations, 
the Vongress of the United States, on the 16th March, 1867, voted to Mr. Peabody 
a magnificent gold medal, since made and presented to him, This testimonial, 
though called s medal, is more properly a piece of symbolic statuary about one 
foot in height—an exquisite work of art. It was manufactured in New York, and 
cost. $7,000. 
Some notice of the policy pursued in its distribution by the almoners of Mr. 
Peabody’s bounty to the South, seems in. this connection appropriate, and will be 
given. . . 
It being of course impossible, with the means at their command, for the Board 
of Trustees to assist all schools, or even all those of one class worthy. of their aid, 
they have, after mature deliberation, and with the approbation of the great donor, 
determined for the present, to confine the benefits of the fund to public sree schools 
for elementary instruction, believing that in this way the neediest portions of the 
whole population can be most readily reached. The entire cost of maintaining 
schools is in no case met by the Board, but communities are encouraged to establish 
them by a contribution from the Board of a part—generally a small part—of the 
money necessary for that purpose. .A school being established, the portion con- 
tributed by the Board is applied by the same municipal agents that control the 
outlay of the rest, the economical administration of which, as it is produced by 
taxation, the people are sufficiently jealous in guarding. All expenses to the 
trustees in making this contribution available is thus avoided, and a system of 
schools introduced, which, being entirely controlled by the organs of the people and 
those immediately interested in their success, are generally acceptable, and likely 
to be perpetuated even when the aid in question is withdrawn. The fund being, 
as before intimated, wholly insufficient to assist all needy communities, it should 
be added that the plan of the Board thus far has been to concentrate it upon cities 
and towns where the largest number of children are accessible, thus’ employing it 
most efficiently—exhibiting models to the surrounding country of a successful 
system, and encouraging the foundatian of similar schools elsewhere. 
Mr. Peabody’s gift being designed for the benefit of both races, the inquiry is 
suggested, and has been often made, whether “mixed schools” are contemplated 
by him or his representatives. To this question pointed reply can be given. The 
Board, as indicated above, assume no control whatever over the arrangement of the 
schools to which assistance is accorded, leaving all such matters entirely with the 
local authorities, who establish and chiefly maintain them; consequently no por- 
tion of the fund can be expended on mixed schools except by the sanction of those
-P-A-G-E-209
LI 
authorities—a sanction which, so far as is known, has been uniformly withheld, 
In point of fact, much the larger part of the help hitherto given has been to white 
schools, those for colored children having been to a large extent provided for from 
other sources, and the Board always affording their aid where it is most needed. 
Mr. Peabody is attended at the Springs by his nephew, Mr. George Peabody Rus- 
sell, and Mrs. Russell, of Salem, Mass., as well as by the Rev. B. Sears, D. D., LL. 
D,, of Staunton, Va. This gentleman was’ formerly Superintendent of Public In- 
struction in. Massachusetts, and subsequently succeeded the celebrated Dr. Way- 
land as President of Brown University, at Providence, R. I., an office which he re- 
signed to assume the duties of General Agent of the Southern Education Fund. 
For this position his talent, experience, and character, eminen'ly qualify him. He 
is known to possess the entire confidence of the distinguished gentlemen composing 
the Board of Trustees—a confidence which Mr. Peabody has confirmed in the 
warmest terins to the present writer, 
Mr. Peabédy shares with ex-Governor Wise, the uppermost cotiage in Baltimore 
Row, and sits.at the same table with General Lee, Mr. Corcoran, Mr. Taggart, and 
others, “He is now in his seventy-fifth year, and is, fortunately for the world, a 
hachelor.’ Being quite infirm, he has been seldom able to come to parlor or dining- 
room, though he has received many ladies and gentlemen at the cottage, and seems 
fond of society. His manners are singularly affable and pleasing, and his counte- 
nance one of tne most benevolent we have ever seen. It is also indisputably hand- 
some. It is pleasant to know that he is particularly gratified with the reception 
he has met here, and with the considerate attention that has been'on every hand 
shown him. Such evidences of regard are highly appreciated by a man who has 
steadfastly declined titles and decorations at the hands of the greatest sovereign in 
Europe. 
U. 
American Schools as Seen by English Eyes. 
  
“« Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face ?”” 
“ No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself 
But by reflection by some other things.” 
We do not value the views others have of us because they are sure to be correct! 
bat because they are quite certain to give us a view different from our own, and so 
help our understanding of ourselves and of our own. .An élaborate report on 
American schools has appeared among the English blue books, It is written by 
Rey, James Frazer, a minister of the English Church, and Assistant Commissioner 
of Education. He came to this country in the spring of 1865, made extended and 
careful observations, and returned in the autumn of the same year. He writes in 
an unusually candid and manly style for an Englishman when writing about any- 
thing American, whether he makes remarks about us pleasant or unpleasant for us 
tohear . Writing of the American people, he observes, “It is no flattery or exag- 
geration to say that it is, if not the most highly educated, yet certainly the mos 
generally educated and intelligent people on earth.” Again, he says, ‘I cannot 
disguise it from myself that the average American, and particularly the average 
American of the mechanic or laboring class, stands on 2 vantage-ground in respect 
both of knowledge and intelligence, as compared with the average Englishmen.
-P-A-G-E-210
LIv 
Alluding to the interest in education during the war for the Union, he says, 
“Never before were realized so strongly the national blessings of education and 
the necessity for democratic institutions resting for a foundation upon the intelli- 
gence and public spirit of the people. Never before, therefore, were more liberal 
appropriations voted for the support of schools; never before were private bene- 
factions more frequent or more munificent; never before was there displayed a 
more universal determination to uphold, in all its integrity, and, if possible, to 
carry onward to a still higher degree of efficiency, the education of the people.’’ 
‘The teacher of the humblest district school,” he remarks, with apparent surprise, 
“ occupies a far higher social position than the teacher of an elementary school in 
England, Opinion and sentiment upon » matter of this kind are formed in the 
two countries by two entirely different influences, As far as his profession is con- 
cerned, he is on a level with anybody.” 
He finds in Americans, particularly our women, special aptness to teach. * They 
certainly have the gift of turning what they know to the best account; they are 
self-possessed, energetic, fearless; they are admirable disciplinarians, firm without 
severity, patient without weakness; their manner of teaching is lively and fertile 
in illustrations; classes are not likely to fall asleep in their hands. They are fona 
of their position, and fired with a laudable ambition to maintain the credit of their 
school; a little too anxious, perhaps, to parade its best side and screen its defects ; 
a little too sensitive of blame, and a little too greedy of praise; but still, as I 
judge them from the samples which I saw, in spite of num2rous instances to the 
contrary which I read of, but did not see, they area very fine, capable body of 
workers in a noble cause. The very best of teachers are produced in abundance in 
the United States.” 
He speaks of the Boston English High School as one that he “ would have liked, 
if possible, to put under a glass case and taken to England for exhibition as a 
model.” He was ‘not so much impressed by its programme as by the excellent 
spirit that seemed to pervade it; the healthy, honest, thorough way in which all 
the work on the part both of masters and pupils, seemed to be done. Everything 
is done to sustain the intellectual toné of the school at a high pitch, ye without 
straining; while there was an honesty, a frankness and absence of restraint in the 
relation between the teacher and the taught which indicated that the moral at- 
mosphere of the school was as healthy and bracing as the intellectual—the model 
school of the United States.” 
He does not hesitate to point out many defects with the same candor. He does 
not find the “training” of our teachers equal to their natural capacity. More and 
better training is needed for teachers. He finds it difficult to find how they are so 
poorly paid, He finds great “lack.of inspection” in our system of education. 
He remarks sharply and fitly upon the abuse of text books. He points out the 
danger of the “high pressure system.” He has made an excellent.contribution to 
the literature of education, We wish his report could be widely circulated and 
read among us. “

  Proceedings of the Board of School Visitors of the Memphis City Schools, 
The Board of. Visitors of the Memphis City Schools met Tuesday evening, De- 
cember Ist, in special session, at the rooms of the County Conimissioners, H. H. 
Higbee presiding. Present, Messrs. Slaughter, Uook, Megibbon, Connell, Bruce, 
Buttinghaus, Comer, Higbee and Atwell. 
W.8. Bruce, chairman of ihe committee sent to Nashville to procure a portion 
of the money due the public schools, read and submitted the following report: 
Gentlemen of the Board of School Visitors : 
Your committee would most respectfully submit the following report, viz: 
We reached Nashville on the 16th instant, and not finding the State. Superin- 
tendent, General John Eaton, Jr., in the city, we proceeded at once to the office of 
the Hon. G. W. Blackburn, Comptroller of the Treasury, and Hon. A. J. Fletcher, 
Secretary of State, who are, by Section 47 of the School Law, together with the 
Governor and State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Commissioners of the 
School Fund. 
The Comptroller received your committee with great kindness and courtesy, and 
proceeded at once to give them all the information and satisfaction in his power, 
and from him-and his published repert to the Legislature, we obtained the follow- 
ing points of information : 
Ist. That the School Fund is greatly reduced, and its total amount rendered 
very uncertain by-a most expensive, circuitous and incomprehensible system of col- 
lecting delinquent taxes, which is now practiced under existing laws. By the 
operation of this system, or “system of systems,” as the Comptroller has been 
pleased to call-it in-his annual report to the Legislature, it seems that some coun- 
ties, paying quite a respectable school tax, are brought in debt to the State, and 
instead of.increasing the general School Fund, they diminish it. This may seem 
improbable, but we are assured that it is really true. 
2d, That the appropriation of $500,000 made by An Act of 1865, has been so 
construed that all other claims against the State should be paid first. So, of course, 
this not only “remains undrawn,” as the Comptroller states in his report, but will 
in all probability, ever remain go. 
8d. That the original State School Fund which was brought back from the 
South aud paid over to the State Treasurer, amounting to the sum of some $600,- 
000, has been used for other than school purposes by the State officials, 
4th. That the Comptroller, in direct violation of Section 47 of the School Law, 
intends to use whatever of the School Fund there may be remaining after all the 
drains, losses and deductions, te pay current expenses and interest on the State 
debt. The Comptroller told your committee, distinctly, that all the benefit the gen- 
eral system of common schools of this State would ever receive from the assess- 
ment of 1867, former assessments, appropriations and accumulated funds, would 
be the pitiful sum of $1,200, paid as the salary of. the State Superintendent. 
Hence, gentlemen, you will see that partly in consequence of the operations of 
bad revenue laws, and partly by the violation of the 47th Section of the School 
Law, there is not a ray of hope that we shall receive any aid from the State, ex- 
cept in the efficient action of the Legislature, to which we would advise an urgent 
and earnest appeal—without delay.
-P-A-G-E-212

In conclusion, your committee take much pleasure in stating that the members 
from this county showed us every attention, and gave to us such information as 
they were able to render. Also the Hon. W. Bosson, of the House, seems to take a 
very deep interest in the public schools of the State, and will, we. believe, use his 
influence to have action taken during the present session of the Legislature, that 
will do credit to the State, Very respectfully submitted,

Extract from an Address by Rev. T. E. Bliss. 
The sentiments of the following extract from an able educational address, by 
Rev. T. E. Bliss, are widely and deeply felt by educators: 
To be successful in our educational work, it is important that we be careful on 
all public occasions and in all public affairs to put gross ignorance at a discount: 
Shakespeare says that there is “no darkness like ignorance,” and Plato, ‘ages 
since, inculcated the maxim “ Beiter to be unborn than untaught,” for “ignorance,” 
he adds, “‘is the root of misfortune” We need not go beyond our penitentiary to 
learn that ignorance isthe bane and curse of a people. It is ever proving itself to 
be the prolific source of vice, crime and lawlessness of every shade and form. It 
operates as @ paralysis upon all enterprise, thrift and advancement, and is the 
cause, in a great measure, of that narrow mindedness, jealousy.and local and sec- 
tiona) hate which are ever so productive of evil. Ignorance may well be called 
Satan’s right arm of power. By means of it, he would still hold the world in sub- 
jection. ‘It stadds in the way of ‘all progress, improvements aad inventions, and 
not unfrequently incites the ungoverned passions of its subjects to Jawlessness, 
riot and blood. The introduction of Arkwright’s spinning-jenny, for this reason, 
met with riotous opposition. They were too ignorant to appreciate its, blessings, 
but only knew enough to be jealous; the fate, usually, of little and utieducated 
minds. In our 6wn time, the battle with ignoratice has had to be fought.by the 
power-looms, the mowers and reapers, the sewing machines, and every form of 
labor-saving and mechanical invention, There is little apology for gross ignotance 
in our day, and it is and ought to.be disgraceful. Regarded as a sin and-shamey 
and it would not be long before our free schools would become a refuge for multi- 
tudes who would, in turn, become their strongest advocates, Especially would 
this be the case with all aspirants for office and public honors. Let it once be dis- 
tinctly understood that henceforth ignoramuses have nothing to expect in public 
life, from ‘an intelligent people, and thi¢ whole subject of popular education would 
Soon assume a very different aspect. Forbearance in this matter has already ceased 
to bea virtue. Experience has shown that there is no Himit to the presumption of 
such men, oo often has intelligence been insulted by their ungrammatical and 
senseless jargon, and too long have we been disgraced before the nation by the
-P-A-G-E-213
LVIE 
blundering exhibitions of such representatives. Men who write God with alittle “g” 
—who know nothing of the geography of the country-~who have hardly mastered 
the rudiments of mathematics far enough to count and add--who couple the singa- 
lr verb with the plural noun, and who are forever torturing in one form or another 
the grand old language of their mother tongue—who, in their wonderful flights of 
fancy after the American eagle, perform such hazardous rhetorical gyrations as 
are sufficieut to frighten that noble bird out of all sense of propriety or cause her 
toscream in anguish from sheer sense of disgust,—such men, we say, do not know 
enough no be in public life, are utterly unfit to be of any real service in the,coun- 
cils of State or nation, aud area dishonor and reproach tothe people who put them 
forward. The influence of their illiterate, vulgar and abusive tirades, upon the 
publie is pernicious in the last degree. This is the chief staple of their har- 
angues—their stock in trade, In this they are at home, and in nothing else. They 
are utterly unequal to a fair, intelligent and manly discussion of any question in- 
volving true statesmanship or sound philosophy. Andso long as such men are 
continued in public life, so long will ignorance be at a premium, and the cause of 
popular education at a discount: Therefore, let us take a stand on this point, and 
bear our testimony and give our influence (other things being equal) to intelligence 
everywhere. Experience has shown that honesty and fitness are guite as likely to 
be coupled with knowledge and good sense as with their opposites. It.is therefore 
alike safe and wise to honor those who honor themselves enough to be creditably 
fitted for the positions to which they aspire.

. GREAT THOUGHTS ON EDUCATION. 
Here and there the great thoughts of the best men in regard to education appear 
in this Report. Few are aware of the attention this subject has received from the 
greatest minds. The following extracts are introduced as specialiy deserving of 
attention ; . . 
A Sentiment for School Trustees.—‘I promised God that I would look upon 
every Prussian peasant. child as a being who could complain of me before God, if I 
did not provide for him the best education, as a man and a Christian, which it was 
possible for me to provide.”——School-Counsellor Dinter. 
Obligation of Parents to Society.—“ A parent who sends his son’ into the 
world uneducated, does a great injury to mankind as well as to his own family, 
for he defrauds the community of a useful citizen, and bequeathes to it a nui- 
sance.”"— Kent. : 
A Forcible Truth Forcibly Put.-—The mobs, the riots, the burnings, the 
lynchings perpetrated by the men of the present day, are perpetrated because of 
their vicious or defective education when children. We see and feel the havoc and 
the rage of their tiger passions now, when they are full grown, but it was years 
ago when they were whelped and suckled.”—Kent. 
“The right to nana includes the right to epucaTE.”—Macaulay.
-P-A-G-E-214
  LVIIL 
Obligation to Hducate the Poor——‘ Wherever there are poor who want t 
be maintained by charity, there must be poor children who, beside this, want to bi 
educated by charity; and whenever there began to be need of legal provisions fo 
the. maintenance of the poor, there must immediately have been need also of som 
particular legal provision in behalf of poor children for their education, this no 
being included in what we call their maintenance.’—Bishop Butler. 
Striking Thought.—“ If poor children are not trained up in the way the: 
should go, they will certainly be trained up in the way they should not go, and inall 
probability will persevere init and become miserable themselves and mischievous to 
society, which in event is worse, upon account of both, than if they had been ex- 
posed to perish in their infancy.” —Bishop Butler. 
Blevate the Masses.—“ The plan of this nation was not, and is not, to see 
how many individuals we can raise up, who shall be distinguished, but to see how 
high, by Free Schools and Free Institutions, we can raise the great mass of popula- 
tion.”—Rev. John Todd. : : 
Education a Threefold Character.—“ Education is the proper training of the 
whole man—the thorough and symmetrical cultivation of allhis noble faculties. If 
he were endowed with a mere physical nature he would need—he would receive— 
none but a physical training. On the other hand, if he were a purely intellectual 
being, intellectual culture would comprehend all that could be included in a per- 
fect education. And were it possible for a moral being to exist without either 
body or intellect, there would be nothing but the heart or affections to educate. 
But man is a complex and not a simple being. He is neither all body, nor all 
mind, nor all heart, In popular language, he has three natures, a corporeal, a ra- 
tional and a moral, These three, mysteriously united, are essential’to constitute a 
perfect man ; and as they all begin to expand in very early childhood, the province 
of education is to watch and assist, and shape the development; to train and 
strengthen, and discipline neither of them alone, but each according to its intrinsic 
and relative importance.”—Dr. Humphrey. 
Value of Physiological Knowledge.—" Every person should be acquainted 
with the organization, structure and functions of his own body—the house in which 
he lives; he should know the conditions of health, and the causes of the numerous 
diseases that flesh is heir to, in order to avoid them, prolong his life and multiply 
his means of usefulness If these things are not otherwise learned, they should be 
taught—the elements of them, at least,—in our primary schools.’—Dr. Combe, 
In What Education Consists.—‘ Education should have for its aim the de- 
velopment and greatest possible perfection of the whole nature of man; his moral, 
intellectual and physical nature. My beau-ideal of human nature would be a be- 
ing whose intellectual faculties were active and enlightened; whose moral senti- 
ments were dignified and firm; whose physical formation was healthy and beauti- 
ful; whoever falls short of this in one particular, be it but the least—beauty and 
vigor of body—falls short of the standard of perfection.""—-Dr. Howe. 
Mental and Physical Training.—‘ Man possesses 2 material and an imma- 
terial part, mutually dependent on each other. These are so intimately connected, 
and sustain such a reciprocal relation to each other that neither can be neglected 
Witkout detriment to both. The body continually modifies the state of the mind, 
and the mind ever varies the condition of the body. Mental and physical training

should then go together. That system of instruction which relates exclusively to 
either is » partial system, and its fate must be that of a house divided against 
itself. Education hag reference to the whole man. It seeks to make a complete 
creature after his kind, giving to both mind and body all the beauty and all the 
perfection of which'they are capable.”"—Prof. Mayhew. 
Mere Cultivation of Intellect not Sufficient —“Numerous have been the instances illustrative of the fact, that the greatest scourges of our race are men of 
gigantic cultivated intellect. Where knowledge but qualifies its possessor for in- 
flicting misery, ignorance would indeed be bliss.” Prof. Mayhew. 
Same Thought.—“ Most men leave out, or regard as of very little importance 
some of the essential elements of a good education, They seem to forget that the 
child has a conscience and a heart to be educated as well as an intellect, If they do 
not lay too much stress on mental culture, which, indeed, is hardly possible, they 
lay by far too little upon that which is moral and religious. They expect to elevate 
the child to his proper station in society—to make him wise and happy, an honest 
man, ® virtuous citizen and a good patriot, by furnishing him with a comfortable 
school house, suitable class books, competent teachers, and, if he is poor, paying 
his quarter bills, while they greatly underrate, if they do not entirely overlook, 
that high moral iraining, without which knowledge is the power of doing evil 
rather than good. Itmay possibly nurture up a race of intellectual giants, but, 
like the sons of Anak, they will be far readier to trample down the Lord’s heritage 
than to protect and cultivate it.”-Dr. Humphrey. 
Cultivate the Moral Nature.—‘‘ Keeping all the while in'view the object of 
popular education, the fitting of the people, by moral as well as intellectual discip- 
Une, for self-government, no one can doubt that any system of instruction which 
overlooks the training and improving of the moral faculties, must be wretchedly 
and fatally defective. So fax from crime and mere intellectual cultivation being 
disassociated in history and statistics, we find them, unhappily, old acquaintances 
and tried friends. To neglect the moral powers in education is to educate not quite 
half the man. To cultivate the intellect only, is to unhinge the mind and destroy 
the balance of the mental powers; itis to light up a recess, only the better to see how 
darkitis, And if this is all that is done in popular education, then nothing, liter- 
ally nothing, is done toward establishing popular virtue, and forming a moral peo- 
ple.”—Hon. Daniel D. Barnard, 
Children Must be Trained Somewhere.—“ Let it be borne in mind, that all 
the children in every community, will be educated somewhere and somehow; and 
that it devolves upon citizens and parents to determine whether the children of 
the present generation shall receive their training in the school house, or in the 
streets; and if in the former, whether in good or poor schools.”-—-Prof. Mayhew. 
Education Dissipates the Evils of Ignorance,-—“ Ignorance is one princi- 
pal cause of the want of virtue, and of the immoralities which abound in the world. 
Were we to take a survey of the moral state of the world, as delineated in the his- 
tory of nations, or as depicted by modern voyagers and travelers, we should find, 
in almost every instance, that ignorance of the character of the true God, and false 
conceptions of the nature of the worship and service he requires, have led, not 
only to the most obscene practices and immoral abominations, but to the perpetra- 
tion of the most horrid cruelties.”--Dr. Dick. 
Education Increases the Productiveness of Labor.—‘‘ Education has a
-P-A-G-E-216
Lx 
power of ministering to our personal and material wants beyond all other ag 
cies, whether excellence of climate, spontaneity of production, mineral resources, 
mines of silver and gold. Every wise parent, every wise community, desiring t 
prosperity of its children, even in ‘the most worldly sense, will spare no pains 
giving them » generous education.”-—Horace Mann. 
Money Value of Intelligence.—“In proportion as man’s intelligence increas 
is his labor more valuable. A small co:npensation is the reward of mere physic 
power; while skill, combined with a moderate amount of strength, commands. hi 
wages. The labor of an ignorant man is scarcely more valuable than the sa 
amount of brute force; but the services of an intelligent, skillful person are a hu 
dred fold more productive.”—Prof. Mayhew. 
The Superiority of the Educated,—‘' The hand is found to be another ban 
when guided by an intelligent mind. Individuals, who, without the aid of knowl 
edge, would have been condemned to perpetual inferiority of condition, aud sub 
Jected to all the evils of want and poverty,-rise to competence and independence 
by the uplifting power of education. In great establishments, and among larg: 
bodies of working men, where all services are rated according to their pecuniary! 
value—where there are no intrinsic circumstances to bind a man down toa fixed 
position, after he has shown a capacity to rise above it—where, indeed, men pass 
by each other, ascending or descending in their grades of labor, just as easily and 
certainly as particles of water of different degrees of temperature glide by each 
other—under such circumstances it is found, as an almost invariable fact, other 
things being equal, that those who have been blessed with a good common school 
education, rise to a higher and a higher point in the kinds of labor performed, and 
also in the rate of wages received, while the the ignorant sink like dregs, and are 
always found at the bottom.”—Prof. Mayhew. 
It is the Interest of Property to Educate All,-— Property is deeply in- 
terested in the education of all. There is no farm, no bank, no mill, no shop—un- 
Jess it be a grog-shop—which is not more valuable and more profitable to its owner 
if located among a well educated, than if surrounded by an ignorant population. 
Simply asa matter of interest, we hold it to be the duty of Property to itself, to pro- 
vide Education for All.” —Horace Greeley. 
‘Education the Parent of Material Riches.—“ A mass of facts, collected by Horace Mann from the most authentic sources, seem to prove incontestably, that 
education is not only a moral renovator, and a multiplier of intellectual power, but 
that it is also the most prolific parent of material riches. It has a right, therefore, 
not only to be included in the grand inventory of the nation’s resources, but to be 
placed at the very head of that inventory, It is not only the most honest and 
honorable, but the surest means of amassing property. Considering education, 
then, as a producer of wealth, it follows that the more educated a people are, the 
more will they abound in all those coriveniences, comforts and satisfactions, which 
money will buy; and other things being equal, the increase of competency and the 
decline of pauperism will be measurable on this seale.’—Prof. Mayhew.     
         
Education Diminishes Pauperism and Crime.—‘ Education is to be re- garded ag one of the most important means of eradicating the germs of pauperism 
from the rising generation, and of securing, in the minds and in the morals of the 
people, the best Protestion Sor the institutions of society. "—English Report to Home

Striking Results.— ‘The different countries of the world, if arranged ac~ 
cording to the state of education in them, will be found to be arranged also accord- 
ing to WEALTH, MORALS and GENERAL HAPPINESS ; at the same time, the CoNnDITION 
OF THE PEOPLE, AND THE EXTENT OF CRIME AND VIOLENCE AMONG THEM FOLLOW 4 
LIKE ORDER. ”—WNational Education, by Fred. Hilt. 
Education the best Insurance to Property.—‘ For those who possess the 
greatest share in the stock of worldly goods, the most effectual way of making in- 
surance on their property, would be to contribute from it enough to sustain an 
eflicient system of Common School education—thereby educating the whole mass 
of mind, and constituting it a police more effective than peace officer's or prisons, 
If then, poverty is at once a cause and effect of crime, as is stated by a late writer, 
who has made an extended survey of the relative state of instruction and social 
welfare in the leading nations of the world, it is directly inferrable that education 
will, and from the nature of the case, must, act in a compound ratio in diminishing 
both pauperism and crime.’—Prof. Mayhaw. 
Political. Necessity of National Education.‘ In proportion as public 
opinion gives force to the structure of a government, it is essential that public 
opinion should be enlightened.”— Washington, 
“T do not hesitate to affirm, not only that a knowledge of the true principles of 
government is important and useful to Americans, but that it is absolutely indis- 
pensable to carry on the government of their choice, and to transmit it to their 
posterity.” —Judye Story. 
“The stability of this government requires that universal education should pre- 
cede universal sufferage."—Mayhew. 
Some kind of Religious Instruction a Necessity — Till men can be 
taught to live and be healihy and strong without food; till some way is discovered 
in which the social state can be perpetuated and made happy with a total separa- 
tion of the sexes; till the time arrives when these things can be done, we cannot 
expect to relieve the human mind from having some kind of religious faith. This 
being the fact, a system of education which excludes attention from this part of 
the mental constitution is as essentially incomplete as a system of ‘military tactics 
that has no reference to fighting Lattles; a.system of mechanics which, teaches 
nothing respecting machinery ; a system of agriculture that has nothing to do 
with planting and harvesting; a system of astronomy which never alludes to the 
stars; a system of politics which gives no intimation on government; or anything 
else which professes to be a system, and leaves out the very element most essential 
to its existence. The history of all ages, of’ all nations, and of all communities, is 
a continued illustration of this truth. Where did the nation ever exist untouched 
either by religion or superstition? which never had either a theology ora mythology? 
When you find a nation that exists without food of some sort, then-you may find 
anation that subsists without religion of some sort; and never, never before. How 
unphilosophical, how absurd it is, then, to pretend that @ system of education may 
be complete, and yet make no provision for this part of the mental constitution. 
It is one of the grossest fooleries which the wickedness of man has ever led him to 
commit. Butit is not only unphilosophical and foolish, it is also exceedingly mis- 
chievous; for where religion is withheld, the mind inevitably falls to superstition, 
as certainly as when wholesome food is withheld the sufferer will seek to satisfy 
his craving with the first deleterious substance which comes within hisreach, The
-P-A-G-E-218

want exists in the soul. It is no factious, no accidental or temporary want, but an 
essential part of our nature. It isan urgent, imperious want; it must and will 
seek the means of satisfaction, and if a healthful supply be withheld, a noxious 
one will be substituted.”"—Dr. Stowe. 
Elevating Influence of Popular Education.—“ In what countries, let me 
ask, are the people most given to the lowest forms of animal gratification, and 
most regardless of the lives and happiness of others? Is it not in Pagan lands, 
over which moral and intellectual darkness broods, and where men are vile without 
shame, and cruel without remorse? And if from Pagan we pass to Christian 
countries, we shall find that those in which education is least prevalent are the 
very ones in which there is the most immorality, and the greatest indifference to 
the sufferings of animated and sentient beings. Spain—in which, until recently, 
there was but one newspaper printed, and in which ouly about one in thirty-five of 
the people are instructed in schools—has a population about equal to that of Eng- 
land and Wales, Popular education in the latter countries, although much behind 
several of the other European States, is still greatly in advance of what it is in 
Spain, and there is an equally marked difference in the state of the morals in the 
people of these two countries. In England and Wales the whole number of con- 
victions for murder in the year eighteen hundred and twenty-six was thirteen; 
and the number convicted for wounding, etc., with intent to kill, was fourteen ; 
while in Spain, the number convicted during the same year was, for murder, twelve 
hundred and thirty-three ! and for maiming with intent to kill, seventeen hundred and 
seventy-three / or a more than one hundred fold greater number than in the former 
countries. Facts like these speak volumes in favor of the elevating influences of 
popular education, while they show most conclusively the low and degraded condi- 
tion to which people will sink in countries in which education is neglected.—Prof, 
Mayhew. 
Education an Insurance of Property.—‘The people do not yet seem to 
see, that the intelligence and the morality which education can impart, is that be- 
neficent kind of insurance, which, by preventing losses, obviates the necessity of 
indemnifying for them; thus saving the premium and risk. 
“What is engulfed in the vortex of crime, in each generation, would build » 
palace of more than oriental splendor in every School District in the land; would 
endow it with a library beyond the ability of a life-time to read; would supply it 
with apparatus and laboratories for the illustration of every study and exemplifica- 
tion of every art, and munificently requite the services of Teachers worthy to pre- 
side in such a sanctuary of intelligence and virtue.’—Horace Mann. 
Influence of an Ignorant Man.---To send an uneducated child into the 
world is injurious to the rest of mankind; it is little better than to turn a mad dog 
or a wild beast into the streets.”--. Paley 
Moral Quarantines.—‘ Much as we may need energetic remedies against conta- 
gious diseases, we need them against contagious vices more; and quarantine laws in favor of mora] health are the most necessary of all sanitary regulations.”’---Hor- 
ace Mann. ‘ 
Duty of the State to Educate—‘ In Prussia it is said that every child is ‘due 
tothe School, Here, it may be laid down as one of our social principles, that, as 
the best services of all her children are due to the State, so itis the duty of the
-P-A-G-E-219
LIL ; 
State to bring out, to their fullest extent, all the talents and powers for good, of all 
her children.”’--- Thomas H. Burrowes. 
Cultivate the Minor Morals.—‘‘ Cleanliness of person, decency of conduct and 
propriety of manners, are as essential to the comfort and happiness of thé social 
state, as a cultivated intellect and a well ordered store of practical knowledge are 
to individual success. When regarded in their relation to society, those decencies, 
which have been aptly denominated ‘the minor morals,’ rise at once to importance, 
and demand the utmost care at the hands of those to whom the training of the 
youth of a country is intrusted.”---Burrowes, 
Education ana Crime.— Taking whole communities together, I believe the legit- 
imate and inevitable conclusion to be, that every advance in knowledge, amongst a 
people, is, pro tanto, an invasion of the domains of crime.”--.Horace Mann, 
A Fearful Responsibility —“If, with such educational means and resources as 
we cap now command, eighty, ninety, ninety-five, or ninety-nine per cent. of all 
children can now be made temperate, industrious, frugal, conscientious in all their 
dealings, prompt to pity and instruct ignorance instead of ridiculing it and taking 
advantage of it, public-spirited, philanthropic, and observers of all things sacred ; 
if, Tsay, any given proportion of our children, by human efforts, and by such a 
divine blessing as the: common course of God’s providence authorizes us to expect, 
can be made te possess those qualities, and to act from them; then, just so far as 
our posterity shall fall below this practicable exemption from vices and crimes, and 
just so far as they shail fail to possess these attainable virtues, just so far will those 
who frame and execute our laws, shapé public opinion, and lead public action, be 
criminally responsible for the difference.”---Horace Mann. 
Love of Children.— He is not worthy to, have the care of children, either as 
officer or teacher, whose heart does not yearn toward them with parental fondness 
and solicitude,”--- Horace Munn. 
Compulsory Education—‘I hold that the State has a right to compel parents 
to take advantage of the means of educating their children. Ifit can punish them 
for crime, it should have the power of preventing them from committing it, by 
giving them the habits and the education that are the surest safeguards.” -Hon 
Josiah Quincy. 
The Redeeming Power of Common Schools.—‘‘ If all our schools were under 
the charge of teachers possessing what I r. gard as the right intellectual and moral 
qualifications, and if all the children of the community were brought under the in- 
fluence of these schools for ten months in the year, I think that the work of train- 
ing up THE WHOLE communiry to intelligence and virtue, would be accomplished as 
completely as any human end can be obtained by human means,”--- Rev, Jacob Ab- 
bott 
Same Thonght.—If the attendance of all the children in any commonwealth 
could be secured at such improved Common Schools as we have been contemplating, 
for ten months during the year, from the age of four to that of sixteen years, they 
would prove competent to the removal ol ninety « -nine one-hundredths of the evils 
with which society is now infested; in one geueration, and would ultimately redeem 
the State from social vices and ‘crimes.”- -Prof. Mayhew. 
A Momentous Question —‘‘Under the soundest and most vigorous system of 
education which we can now command, what proportion, or per centage, of all the
-P-A-G-E-220
LXIV 
children who are born can be made useful and exemplary men, honest dealers, con- 
scientious jurors, true witnesses, incorruptible voters or magistrates, good parents, 
good neighbors, good members of society? In othér words, with our present 
knowledge of the art and science of education, and with such. new fruit of expe- 
rience as time may be expected to bear, what proportion, or per centage, of all 
children must be pronounced irreclaimable and irredeemable, notwithstanding the 
most vigorous educational efforts which, in the present state of society, can be put 
forth in their behalf? 
“What proportion, or per centago, must become drunkards, profane swearers, de- 
tractors, vagabonds, rioters, cheats,thieves, aggressors upon the rights of property, 
of reputatidn, or of life? 
‘‘In a single phrase, what proportion must be guilty of such omissions of right 
and commissions of wrong, that it would have been better for the community had 
they never been born? This is a problem which the course of events has evolved, 
and which society and the government must meet,”---Horace Mann. 
Better than Soil, or Climate, or Government.— That vast variety of ways, in 
which an intelligent people surpass a stupid one, and an exemplary people an im- 
moral one, has infinitely more to do with the well-being of a nation than soil, or 
climate, or even than government itself, except so far ‘as government may prove to 
be the patron of intelligence and virtue.’”’---Horace Mann. 
A Truth Human knowledge is a proud pillar, but it is built in the midst of a 
desert of ighorance, and those who have ascended the highest have only gained a 
more extended view of the waste.” 
Godlike Powers of Intellect.—Le Verrier, the discoverer of the planet Neptune, 
wrote a letter to Galle, of Berlin, in which he said: ‘This star po one has seen, 
but it exists. I have measured its distance. Thave estimated its size. I have 
calculated its diameter. Itis there. Look for it and you will find it.’ It was dis- 
covered from the observatory of Berlin on the 28d of September, 1846, just where 
the student, in his closet, had told the practical astromomer to look. 
A Striking Picture —“ Were we to visit all the Primary Schools of the common- 
wealth, we should be sure to find nearly all the ministers, lawyers, manufacturers, 
and, in short, all the most intelligent, active and useful men of the next generation, 
in these schools. We cannot now point them out by name. We cannot tell who of 
them will be governors and judges, and merchant princes, but they are.all there. 
«They are receiving the rudiments of their education under such teachers as we 
provide for them, and in the period of life when the most lasting impressions are 
made. 1 will venture to say, more is done, during the first ten or twelve years, in the 
humble district School House, to give tone and shape to the popular mind, than in all 
the years that follow.---Dr. Humphrey. 
‘Wonderful Results—‘It is thus established, that a good system of common 
school education, one that is sufficiently comprehensive to embrace all our country’s 
youth in its benevolent design, would free us as a people from a host of evils grow- 
ing out of popular ignorance; that it would increase the productiveness of labor, 
as the schools advanee in excellence, indefinitely ; that it would save to society, in 
diminishing the number of paupers and criminals, a vast amount of means absorbed 
in the support of the former, and in bringing the latter to justice, a tax which 
upon every present generation is more than sufficient for the education of the next
-P-A-G-E-221
  LXV 
succeeding one; that it would prevent the great majority of fatal accidents that 
are now depopulating communities wherever ignorance prevails; that, by im- 
parting w knowledge of the organic laws, the observance of’ which is essential to 
health and happiness, it would save the lives of a hundred thousand children in 
the United States every year, and that by promoting longevity, in connection 
with the advantages already enumerated, it would tend more than alt other means 
of state policy to increase at once the wealth and the population of our country ; 
that its legitimate tendeucy would be to diminish, from generation to generation, 
not only drunkenness and seusuality in all its protean forms, but idiocy and in- 
sanity, which result from a violation of the laws of our being, which are the laws 
of God; that it would, in innumerable ways, tend to diminish the sufferings and 
mitigate the woes incident to human life, while it would acquaint man with the 
benevolent Creator, and lead him to cherish an habitual desire to yield obedience 
thereto; and that it is the only possible means of perfecting and perpetuating the 
inestimable boon of civil and religious liberty to the latest generations, and thus 
securing to the race the maximum of human happiness. “Yes, a system of popu- 
lar educaiton adequate to the requirements of the States of.this Union will do all 
this. None, then, it would seem, can fail te see that true staté policy requires the 
maintenance of improved free schools, good ‘enough for the best, and cheap enough 
for the poorest, which are a necessary means of universal education.” ‘Prof. 
Mayhew. ; : 
The Prison and the School.“ The great difference, in a moral point of view 
between a school and a prison is, that one is intended to prevent what the other 
aims to punish.” —George B. Emerson, . 
Duty of Parents. That parent who refuses to send his children to the school 
established and opened in his neighborhood, oes to those children a cruel injustice, 
and commits a flagrant wrong upon the ‘community and the State.”—Gov. Briggs. 
‘What Criminal Statistics Show.— Scotland’ and Spain have been referred to, 
not to bring. out a few facts in history merely, but to illustrate an. important truth. 
Where a good system of popular education is well administered in a country, and, 
88 & consequence, intelligence, ‘industry and morality become universal among its 
citizens, they will-eventually become a wealthy and a highly prosperous and happy. 
community, even though they derive their subsistance from @ naturally unfruitful 
soil; but, on the contrary, where popular education is néglected in a common-.. 
wealth, and-its future citizens, as a consequence, grow up in ignorance, idleness. 
and vice, squalid poverty and flagrant crime will become prevalent throughout a 
wretched and degencrate community, that is scarcely able to gain a@ mere _Subsist-. 
ence from a naturally productive soil. 
“Tn further confirmation of the truth of.the proposition that education dimin~ 
ishes crime, I will introduce the following statistics, gleaned from various official 
documents, respecting prisons, According to returns to the British Parliament,, 
the ‘commitments for crimes in an average of nine years, in proportion to- popula- 
tion, are as follows: In Manchester, the most infidel city in the nation, one in 140; 
in London, one in 800; in all Ireland, one in 1,600; and in ‘Bootland, celebrated 
for learning and religion, one in 20,000! 
“The Rev. Dr. Forde, for many years the Ordinary of Newgate, Londen, repre- 
sents ignorance as the first great cause, and idleness as the second, of ail the crimes 
committed by the inmates of that celebrated prison. Sir Richard Phillips, Sheriff 
of London, says that, on the memorial addressed to the Sheriffs, by 152 criminals 
ba
-P-A-G-E-222

in the same institution, 25 only signed their names in a fair hand, 26 in an illeg- 
ible scrawl, and that 101, two-thirds of the entire number, were marksmen, signing 
with a cross. Few of the prisonors could read with facility; more than half of 
them could not read at all; the most of them thought books were useless, and 
were totally ignorant of the nature, object, and end of religion. 
“The Rev. Mr. Clay, Chaplain to the House of Correction in Lancashire, rep- 
resents that, out of 1,129 persons committed, 554 could not read; 222 were barely 
capable of reading; 88 only who could read well; and only 8, or onein 141, could 
read and write well. One-half of 1,129 prisoners were quite ignorant of the 
simplest truths; 37 of these, one in 20 of the entire number, were occasional read- 
ers of the Bible; and only one, out of this large number, was familiar with the 
Holy Scriptures and conversant with the principles of religion. Among the 516, 
represented as entirely ignorant, 125 were incapable of repeating the Lord’s Prayer. 
“In the New York State Prisons, as examined a few years ago, more than three- 
fourths of the convicts had either received no education, or a very imperfect one. 
Out of 842 at Sing Sing, 289 could not read or write, and only 42--less than one 
in twenty—had received a good common school education. Auburn prison pre- 
sents similar statistics. Out of 228 prisoners, only 59 could read, write and cipher, 
and 60 could do neither. 
“The Chaplain of the Ohio Penitentiary remarks that, not only in the prison of 
that State, but in others, depraved appetites and corrupt habits, which have led to 
the commission of crime, are usually found with the ignorant, uninformed and 
duller part of mankind, Of 276, at one time in that institution, nearly all were 
below mediocrity, and 175 are represented as grossly ignorant, and, in point of ed- 
ucation, scarcely capable of transacting the ordinary business of life.”—Prof. 
Mayhew. 
Why Society Should Educate the Poor.—‘‘The same humane reasons which 
lead civilized communities to provide for the maintenance of indigent adults by 
legal enactments, bear even more strongly in the case of their children. These re- 
quire sustenance in common with their parents. But their wants, their necessities 
stop not here; neither does the well-being of society with reference to them. Both 
alike require that such children, in common with,all others, be so trained as to be 
enabled not only to provide for themselves when they arrive at mature years, but 
as shall be necessary to qualify them for the discharge of the duties of citizenship. 
Then, instead of taxing society for a support, as their parents now do, they will 
contribute to the elevation of all around, even more largely than society has con- 
tributed to their elevation.”—Prof. Mayhew. 
Great Effects from Little Causes.—‘ The Vizier having offended his master, was 
condemned to perpetual captivity in a lofty tower. At night his wife came to 
weep beneath his window. ‘Cease your grief,’ said the sage; ‘go home for the 
present, and return hither when you have procured a live black beetie, together 
with a little ghee (or buffalo’s butter,) three clews, one of the finest silk, another 
of stout packthread, another of whipcord, and finally a stout coil of rope.’ When 
she came to the foot of the tower, provided according to her husband’s commands, 
he directed her to touch the head of the insect with a little ghee, to tie one end of 
the silk thread around him, and to place the reptile on the wall of the tower, Se 
duced by the smell of the butter, which he conceived to be in store somewhere 
above him, the beetle continued to ascend till he reached the top, and thus put the 
Vizier in possession of the end of the silk, who drew up the packthread by means
-P-A-G-E-223
  LXVIE 
of the silk, the small cord by means of the packthread, and by means of the cord 
a stout rope, capable of sustaining his own weight—and so at last he escaped from 
the place of duress.”—London Quarterly Review. 
The Germ of Crime.—“He is no more physically blind, or bereft of his natural 
senses, who cannot see a culprit inthe hands of a Sheriff, or a criminal court with 
its officers, or a prison with its armed guards, than he is morally blind who does 
not see criminal manhood in noglected childhood.’— Horace Mann. 
How Education Diminishes Crime.“ Great as is her poor-tax, New York con- 
tributes annually an immensely greater sum for the support of her criminal po- 
lice; for the erection of court houses, and jails, and- penitentiavies, and houses of 
correction; for the arrest, trial, conviction and punishment of criminals, and for 
their support in prison and at the various landing places on their way to the gal- 
lows and to a premature and ignominious death. Now, had one-half of the money 
which this State has expended in these two ways been judiciously bestowed in the 
early education of these unfortunate persons, who can question that the poor and 
criminal taxes of that State would have been reduced to less than one-tenth of 
what they now are, to say nothing of the fountains of tears that would be thus 
dried up, and of the untold happiness that would be enjoyed by persons who, in 
every generation, lead cheerless lives and die ignoble deaths? 
“Lest some persons may labor under an erroneous impression in relation to 
this subject, I will give the statistics of education and crime in New York, as de- 
rived from official reports, for the last few years, Of eleven hundred and twenty- 
two persons—the whole number reported by the sheriffs of the different counties of 
the State as under conviction and punishment for crime during the year 1847— 
twenty-two only had a common education, and only six were well educated. Of 
the thirteen hundred and forty-five criminals so returned in the several counties 
of the State, for the year 1848, twenty-three only had a common school education, 
thirteen only had a tolerable education, and only ten were considered well edu- 
cated! The returns for other years give like results. Had the whole eleven or 
«-rteen hundred of these convicts been well educated instead of only six or ten—- 
and the moral and religious education of even these were defective—how many of 
them would society be called upon to support in prisons and penitentiaries? In 
all probability, as we shall hereafter, I hope, be able to show, Not onz. And what 
is true of the city and county of Philadelphia and of the State of New York, will 
apply io other cities, counties and States of this Union.”—Prof. Mayhew, 
Necessity of Moral Education.—‘ The exaltation of talent, as itis called, above 
religion and virtue, is the curse of the age. Education is now chiefly a stimulus 
to learning, and thus men acquire power, without the principles which alone make it 
good. Talent is worshipped; but if divorced from rectitude, it will prove more of 
a demon than a god.””— Channing. 
A Startling Alternative. We are brought, then, to this startling but inevitable 
alternative. The natural life of an infant should be extinguished as soon as it is 
born, or the means should be provided to save that life from being a curse to its 
possessor ; and therefore every State is bound to enact @ code of laws legalizing 
and enforcing infanticide, or acode of laws establishing Free Schools.’ °— Horace * 
Mann.

ation, for which we personally receive little benefit. I know not how much I may 
have paid'during the last thirty years, for the judiciary administration of the laws 
yet I have never availed myself of the courts as a means of obtaining personal 
justice. And there are many citizens who never had a case in court, and perhaps 
never willhave. Yet we all cheerfully submit to taxation for the support of the 
Judiciary Department, because the public good is supposed to require it. We vol- 
untarily act on this unselfish and philanthropic principle in all-our religious and 
charitable associations. We build churches, employ and pay religious teachers, 
and support religious institutions, not for our own personal benefit. We usually 
fancy we can be devotional and yeligious in our own quiet way. But the good of 
society requires expensive organizations for religious purposes, and we are all 
willing to bear our part, 
“These principles of sacrifice of selfishness—of submission to ‘taxation of some 
kind for the public good, must lie at the foundation of every form of civilized so- 
ciety on earth, If we proscribe the principle, we must go back to a state of natu- 
ral society—to barbarism—to savage independence. Our people are a liberal, a 
generous, a magnanimous people, and when the general interests of public educa- 
tion in the State require some sacrifice from the more successful individuals in 
favor of the poorer families, who will hesitate to act the part which honor and 
magnanimity require?’—LHon. W. C. Larrabee, State Superintendent of Indiana. 
Argument for the Payment of School Taxes.‘ Some .persons who are willing 
to pay taxes in proportion t9 their property, for general State purposes, object to 
any species of taxation for educational purposes. This objection is founded on a 
radically: wrong notion of the relation of the children, and the education thereof, 
to the Srate. - The State, within constitutional limits, has sovereign power over the 
property within its jurisdiction, The children within the State. are, in a certain 
sense, the children of the State.. The State taxes her property for the education 
of her children, not for the personal interest of the children, nor for the interest 
of their parents, but for her own interests asa State. This is the American idea, 
and whoever cannot become reconciled to this idea had better emigrate to some _ 
other country,”—Hon, W. C. Larrabee. 
A Home Thrust—* You say you have no children to educate, and why should you 
be taxed to elevate the children of your neighbor? So, perhaps, you have no vcca- 
sion to travel over a particular country road, and why should you be taxed to build 
it? You have no case in court, why then should you be taxed to build the court 
house, or pay the. salary of the Judge? You have no criminals of your own fam- 
ily to try, and to put in jail, why then should you be taxed to’ pay the expenses of 
trying criminals raised by your neighbors, and to build jails to hold them? 
“ You answer, the good of society requires court houses and courts, So does the 
good of society require School Houses and Schovls. You say the good of society 
requires that criminals should be tried and punished. So does the good of society 
require children to be educated, The criminal, you say, is not tried and punished 
for his own benefit, or the benefit of his family so much as for the protection of 
society. So, the child is not educated so much for his own benefit, or the benefit of his family, as for the protection and the good of society."—-Hon. W. C. Larrabee. 
For those who Object to the School Tax.—‘ A gentleman was complaining to me Of his school tax. Ho said «he bad educated his own children at his own expense, and yet he was annually paying tax to eduaate others,’ I told him he was indi-

recily compensated four-fold for all his expenditure.. ‘He ridiculed the idea. Said 
J, there are-two farms of one hundred acres each, intrinsically of the same value. 
One is located in an intelligent and virtuous commanity, the other in heathendom, 
or where ignorance and vice prevail, How-much more would you give, per acre, 
for the former than the latter 2. ‘Ten dollars,’ said he. The interest on one thou- 
sand dolfara is sixty dollars per annum—your school tax is six dollars, Your com- 
pensation is ten-fold. The argument was conclusive.”—J. V. Gibbon's Report. 
Testimony against Flogging.—“ In truth, the maxim is rapidly fixing itself in 
the public mind, that the ability to govern, by moral means, an appropriate number 
of pupils, is a fair test of the capacity and fitness of the Teacher. Failure to pov- 
ern well-a class of forty or fifty children, without the use of the rod, is fast coming 
to be considered an indication that the Teacher has mistaken bis vocation, And I 
must take occasion to remark, as a fact within my official observatlon, thatthe 
order and excellence of those schools is precisely of the highest character, which 
in their government have dispensed altogether with corporal punishment.’”— Wm. 
A. Walker, Superintendent of New York City and County. 
Corporal Punishment not Indispensable.‘ It appears from the reports of 
the committees, and from other equally authentic evidence, that not less than five 
hundred schools in the State were taught last year without the infliction of a blow. 
As it is the almost uniform testimony of the committees, that the Schools so kept, 
have stood in the foremost rank for regularity, diligence and good order.” —Zforace 
Mann. 
Young Children should not be Confined.—“It would be infinitely better aad 
wiser to employ suitable persons to superintend the exercises and amusements of 
children under seven years of age, in the fields, orchards and meadows, and point 
out to them the richer beauties of nature, than to have them immured in crowded. 
School-rooms, in a state of inaction, poring over torn books and primers, conning 
words of whose meaning they are ignorant, and breathing foul air.”—Dr. Caldwell, 
Effects of Bad Ventilation in Schools.— Both irritability of the nervous sys- 
tem and dullness of the intellect are unquestionably the. direct and necessary result 
of a want of pure air, The vital energies of the pupils are thus prostrated, and. 
they become not only restless and indisposed to study, but absolutely incapable of 
stuoying. “Their minds hence wander, and they unavoidably seek relief in mis- 
chievous and disorderly conduct. This doubly provokes the already exasperated 
teacher, who can hardly look with complaisance upon good behavior, and who, from 
a like cause, is in the same irritable condition of both body and miad, with them- 
selves. Hetoo must needs give vent to his irascible feelings somehow. And what 
ig more natural under such circumstances, than to resort to the use of the ferule, 
the rod and the strap ?”"—Praf Mayhew. 
Value of Vocal Music in Schools.—“I here introduce a fact which has been 
suggested to me by my profession, and that is, that the exercise of the organs of 
the breast by singing, contributes very.much to defend them from those diseases 
to which the climate and other causes expose them. The Germans are seldom 
afflicted with gonaumption, nor have I ever known but on instance of spitting 
blood: This, I believe, is in part occasioned by the strength which their lungs acguire 
by exercising them frequently in vocal music; for this constitutes an essential branch 
of their education."—Dr. Rush. 
Frequency of Recess.—‘‘A law of the muscular system requires that relaxation
-P-A-G-E-226
Lxx 
and contraction should alternate; or, in other words, that rest should follow exer- 
cise. In accordance with this law it is easier to walk than to stand; and in stand- 
ing, it is easier to change from one foot to the other than to stand still. This ex- 
‘plains why small children after sitting awhile in school become restless. Proper 
regard for this organic law requires: that ithe smaller children be allowed a recess 
as often, at least, as once an hour; and that all be allowed and encouraged fre- 
quently to change their position.”’—Prof. Mayhew. 
Bvils of badly.constructed School Furniture.“ There is a radical defect in 
the seats of our School Rooms. Malformation of the bones, narrow chests, coughs, 
ending in consumption and death in middle life, besides a multitude of minor ills, 
have their origin in the Schoo! Room. To the badly-constructed seats and writing 
desks, are we to look, in some measure, for the cause of so many distortions of the 
bones, spinal diseases and chronic affections, now so prevalent throughout the 
eountry.”’—Dr. J. V. C. Smith. 
Act upon it.“ High and narrow seats are not only extremely uncomfortable for 
the young scholar, tending constantly to make him restless and noisy, disturbing 
his temper and preventing his-attention to his books, but they have a direct ten- 
dency to produce deformity of his limbs. Seats without backs have an equally 
unfavorable influence upon the spinal column. If no rest is afforded the backs of 
the children while seated, they almost necessarily assume a bent and crooked posi- 
tion. Such a position often assumed and long continued, tends to that deformity 
which has become extremely common among children of modern times, and leads 
to diseases of the spine in innumerable instances, especially with delicate female 
children.”—-Dr. Woodward. 
On Imparting Collateral Knowledge.—'‘ We cannot remind teachers too often 
of the signal benefits they may confer upon their pupils, by communicating collat- 
eral knowledge tothem ;—that is, such knowledge as is directly connected with 
the subject of their lessons, though rarely, if.ever, found in a text-book. This 
practice should be commenced with a child the first day he enters the School Room, 
and should never be discontinued until the day when, for the last time, he leaves it, 
“The whole business of the Schoo! Rcom, from morning till night, should in this 
‘way, be made attractive and profitable. Children do love information which ig 
adapted to their capacities, and they will desire to go where it can be found, as 
naturally as bees to flowers. An absurd objection is sometimes urged against such 
a course; namely, that it will only amuse children, turn what should be toil into 
pastime, and create a disrelish for close, pains-taking, solitary application. This 
objection is theoretic, merely. It is urged only by such as are too ignorant or too 
indolent to make the necesgary preparation. Not only reason, but experience, 
proves that it is the best possible means of kindling a desire for knowledge in the 
bosoms of the young; and when this desire is once kindled, the teacher has only 
to direct the car instead of dragging it.’—Horace Mann. 
A Noble Sentiment, Eloquently Expreased.—‘The Greek rhetorician, Longi- 
nus, quotes from the Mosaic account of the creation what he calls the sublimest 
passage ever uttered: ‘God said, Let there be light; and there was light’ From 
the centre of black immensity, effulgence burst forth. Above, beneath, on every 
side, its radiance streamed out, silent, yet making each spot in the vast concave 
brighter than the line which the lightning pencils upon the midnight cloud. Dark- 
ness fled, as the swift beams spread onward and outward; still they move to this 
day, glorifying, through wider and wider regions of space, the infinite Author
-P-A-G-E-227
UXXI 
from whose power and beneficence they sprang. But not only in the beginning, 
when God created the heavens and the earth, did he say, ‘Let there be light,’ 
Whenever a human soul is born into the world, its Creator stands over it, and again 
pronounces the same sublime words, ‘Let there be light.’ 
“Magnificent, indeed, was the material creation, when suddenly blazing forth, 
in mid space, the new-bcrn sun dispelled the darkness of the ancient night. But 
infinitely more magnificent is it, when the human soul rays forth its subtler and 
swifter beams—when the light of the senses irradiates all outward things, reveal- 
ing the beauty of their colors and the exquisite symmetry of their proportions and 
forms, when the light of reason penetrates to their invisible preperties and laws, 
and displays all those hidden relations that make up all the sciences; when the 
light of conscience illamines the moral world, separating truth from error, and 
virtue from vice. The light of the newly-kindled sun, indeed, was glorious. It 
struck upon all the planets, and waked into existence their myriad capacities of 
life and joy. As itrebounded from them, and showed their vast orbs all wheeling, 
circle beyond circle, in their stupendous courses, the sons of God shouted for joy. 
That light sped onward, beyond Sirius, beyond the Pole-star, beyond Orion and the 
Pleiades, and is still speeding onward into the abysses of space. But the light of 
the human soul flies swifter than the light of the sun, and outshines its meridian 
blaze. It can embrace not only the sun of our system, but all suns and galaxies 
of sung; aye! one soul is capable of knowing and enjoying Him who created the 
suns themselves; and when ‘these starry lustres that now glorify the firmament 
shall wax dim, and fade away like a wasted taper, the light of the soul shall still 
rewain; vor time, nor cloud, nor any power but its own perversity, shall ever 
quench its brightness, Again, I would say, that whenever a human soul is born 
into the world, God stands over it, aud pronounces the same sublime fiat, ‘ Let 
there be light ;* snd may the time soon come when all human governments shall 
co-operate with the divine government in carrying this bencdiction and baptism 
into fulfillment.”—Horace Mann, 
«That legislators and rulers are responsible. 
“Tn our country and in our times no man is worthy the honored name of a states- 
man who does not include the highest practical education of the people in all hig 
plans of administration, 
“He may have eloquence, he may have a knowledge of all history, diplomacy 
jurisprudence, and by these he may claim, in other countries, the elevated rank of 
a statesman, but unless he speaks, plans, labors at all times and in all places for 
the culture and edification of the whole people, he is not, he cannot be, an Amer- 
ican statesman.” —Horace Mann. 
‘That which makes a good constitution must keep it, namely, men of wisdom 
and virtue; qualities that because they descend not with worldly inheritance must 
be carefully propagated by a virtuous education of youth, for which spare no cost; 
for by such parsimony all that is saved is lost.’— Wm. Penn, 
“ But there are other things, of the worth of which the demand of the market 
is by no means a test; things of which the utility does not consist in ministering 
to inclinations, nor in serving the daily uses of life, and the want of which is least 
felt where the need is greatest. This is peculiarly true of those things which are 
chiefly useful as tending to raise the character of human beings. The uncultivated 
cannot be judges of cultivation. 
“Those who most ueed to be made wiser and better usually desire it least, and if

they desired it, would be incapable of finding the way to it by their own lights. It 
will continually happen‘on the voluntary system, that, the end not being desired, 
the means will not be provided at all, or that the persons requiring improvement 
having an imperfect or altogether erroneous conception of what they want, the 
supply called forth by the demand of the market will be anything but what is 
really required,: Now any well-intentioned and tolerably civilized government 
may think, without presumption, that it does, or ought to possess.a degree of culti- 
“vation above the average of the community which it rules, and that it should, 
therefore, be capable of offering better education and better instruction to the 
people, than the greater number of them would spontaneously selects 
.** Education, therefore, is one of those things which it is admissible in principle 
that the government should provide for the people. The case is one to which the 
reasons of the non-interference principle do not necessarily or universally extend.” 
—John Stuart Milt. | . 
“To make the people fittest to choose, and the chosen fittest to govern, will be to 
mend our corrupt and faulty education, to teach the people faith, not without vir- 
tue, temperance, modesty, sobriety, economy, justice; not to admire wealth or honor; 
to hate turbulence and ambition; to place every one his private welfare and hap- 
piness in the public peace, liberty and safety.”——John Milton

which all mankind in all ages, will send up against you, if you stand still and suf- 
fer a far deadlier foe than the Turcoman,—suffer the parent of all evil, all fatse- 
hood, all hypocrisy, all discharity, all self secking—bim who covers over with pre-

MORE EXTENDED OPINIONS OF EMINENT MEN; 
The following extracts from the writings of eminent men of the’ country are 
specially pertinent to the present state of educational matters in Tennessee, 
Hon, Joun Quincy ADAMS says: 
‘We see monarchs, expending vast sums, establishing Normal Schools through ao 
their realms, and sparing no pains to carry knowledge and efficiency to all the 
children of their poorest subjects. SHALL WE BE OUT DONE BY KINGS? Shall 
monarchs steal a march on republics in the patronage of that education on which 
arepublic is based? On this great and glorious cause let us expend freely; yes, 
Mors freely than on any other. There was a usage,” he adds, “in the ancient re- 
public of Sparta, which now occurred to him, and which filled his mind with this 
pleasing idea, viz: That these endeavors of ours for the fit education of all our 
children would be the means of raising up a generation around us which would 
be superior to ourselves. The usage alluded to was this: The inhabitants of the 
city, on a certain day, collected together and marched in procession; dividing 
thomselves into three companies, the old, the middle-aged, and the young. When 
assembled for the sport and exercises, a dramatic scene was introduced, and the 
three parties had each‘a speaker; and Plutarch gives the form of phraseology used 
in the several addresses on the occasion, The old men speak first, and addressing 
those beneath them in age, say: 
. ‘We have been in days of old, 
Wise, generous, brave and bold.” 
Then came the middle-aged, and casting a triumphant look at their seniors, say 
to them: : ” : 
‘That which in days of yore ye wero, 
We at the present momentare.” 
Last march forth the children, and looking bravely upon both companies who 
had spoken, they shout forth these: 
‘Hereafter, at our country’s call, 
‘We promise to surpass you all.’ 
Hon. Danie, Wexster said: 
“He was anxious to concur with others in aid of the project. The ultimate aim 
was to elevate and improve the primary schools, and to secure competent instruc- 
tion to every child which should be born. No object is greater than this, and the 
means, the forms and agents, are each and all important.” He expressed his ob- 
ligation to town schools, and paid a tribute to their worth, considering them the 
foundation of our social and political system, He said “he would gladly bear his 
part of the expense. The town schools need. improvement; for if they are no 
better now than when I attended them, they are insufficient to the wants of the 
present day. They have till lately been overlooked by men who should have 
considered them, He rejoiced at the noble effort here made of late, and hoped 
they might be crowned with entire success. * * * It has become the fashion

     to teach every thing through the press. Conversation so valued in ancient Greec 
is overlooked and neglected; whereas it is the richest source of culture. We teac 
too much by manuals, too little by direct intercourse with the pupil’s mind; wi 
have too much of words, too little of things. Take any of the common depart 
ments, how little do we really know of the practical details, say geology. It i 
taught by books. It should be taught by excursions in the fields. So of other| 
things. We begin with the abstracts, and know little of the detail of facts; w 
deal in generals, and go not to particulars; we begin with the representative, 
leaving out the constituents. Teachers should teach things. It is a reproach that 
the public schools are not superior to the private. If I had as many sons as old 
Priam, I would send them all to the public schools. The private schools have in- 
jured in this respect, the public; they have impoverished them They who should 
be in them aré withdrawn; and like so many uniform companies taken out of the 
general militia, those left behind are none the better. The plan of a Normal 
School in Plymouth is designed to elevate our Common Schools, and thus to carry 
out the noble ideas of one of our Pilgrim Fathers. There is a growing need that 
this be done. But there is a larger view yet. Hvery man and woman, every 
brother and every sister is a teacher, Parents are eminently teachers. Every 
man has an interest in the community, and helps his share to shepe it. Now, if 
Normal Schools are to teach teachers, they enlist this interest on the right side; 
they make parents and all who in any way influence childhood, competent to their 
high office, The good which these seminaries are thus to spread through the com- 
munity is incaleulable. They will turn all of the noblest enthusiasm of the land 
into the holy channel of virtue and knowledge. Now, if our Plymouth school 
succeeds, they will go up in every part of the State, and who then can compute 
the exalted character which they may finally create among us. In families there 
will be. better teaching, and the effect will be felt throughout society. This effort 
thus far has done good. It has raised up in many minds a clear conclusion of the 
importance of competent teachers; and a clear benefit to follow this will be to 
raise the estimation in which teachers should be held. He hoped that this course 
of policy would raise, even beyond what we expected, the standard of elementary 
instruction. He considered the cost very slight. It cannot come into any ex- 
panded mind as an objection, It is an experiment—it is a noble one, and should 
be tried.” 
Mr. Webster has always stood out a bold and eloquent advocate of Common 
Schools, In his Centennial Address, at Plymouth, in 1822, he paid the following 
noble tribute to the policy of New England in this respect: 
“In this particular, New England may be allowed to claim, I think, a merit of 
peculiar character. She early adopted and has constantly maintained the prin- 
ciple, that it is the undoubted right and the bounden duty of government, to pro- 
Vide for the instruction of all youth. That which is elsewhere left to chance, or 
to charity, we secure by law. For the purpose of public instruction, we hold 
every man subject to taxation in proportion to his property, and we look not to 
the question, whether he himself have, or have not, children to be benefited by 
the education for which he pays. We regard it as a wise and liberal system of 
Police, by which property, and life, and the peace of society are secured. We 
seek to prevent, in some measure, the extension of the penal code, by inspiring 6 
salutary and corrective principle of virtue and of knowledge in an earlier age. 
‘We hope to excite a feeling of respectability and a sense of character by enlarg-
-P-A-G-E-231

ing the capacity and increasing the sphere of intellectual enjoyment. By general 
instruction, we seek as far as possible to purify the whole moral atmosphere, to keep 
good sentiments uppermost, and to turn the strong current of feeling and opinion, 
as well as the censures of the law, and the denunciations of religion, against im- 
morality and crime. “We hope for a security beyond the law, and above the law, 
inthe prevalence of enlightened and well-principled moral sentiment. We hope 
to continue and prolong the time when, in the villages and farm-houses of New 
England, there may be undisturbed sleep within unbarred doors. And knowing 
that our government rests directly on the public will, that we may preserve it, we 
endeavor to give a safe and proper direction to the public will. We do not, indeed, 
expect all men to be philosophers or statesmen; but, confidently trust, and « ur ex- 
pectation of the duration of our system of government rests on that trust, that 
by the diffusion of general knowledge and good and virtuous sentiments, the 
political fabric may be secured, as well against open violence and overthrow, as 
against the slow but sure undermining of licentiousness.”’ 
Ina speech delivered at Madison, Indiana, afier congratulating the people of 
the State on the attention they had paid to Common School education, Mr. Web- 
ster adds: 
“Amongthe planets in the sky of New England—the burning lights which throw 
intelligence and happiness on her people—the first and most brilliant is her system 
of free Common Schools. I congratulate myself that my first speech on entering - 
public life was in their behalf. Education, to accomplish the ends of good gov- 
ernment, should be universally diffused. Open the door of the school-house to all 
the children of the land. Let no man have the excuse of poverty for not educating 
his own offspring. Place the means of education within his reach, and if they remain 
in ignorance be it his own reproach. If one object of the expenditure of your rev- 
enue be protection against crime, you could not desire a better or cheaper means of 
obtaining it. Other nations spend their money in providing means for its detection 
and punishment; but it is for the principles of our government to provide for its 
never occurring—the one acts by comrcron the other by PREVENTION. On the 
diffusion of education among the people rests the preservation and perpetuation 
of our free institutions. I apprehend no danger to our country from a foreign 
foe, The prospect of a war with any powerful nation is too remote to be a mat- ’ 
ter of calculation. Besides, there is no nation on earth powerful enough to accom- 
plish our overthrow. Our destruction, should it come at all, will be from another 
quarter, From the inattention of the people to the concerns of their govern- 
meni—from their carelessness and negligence, I must confess that I do appre- 
hend some danger. I fear that they may place too implicit a confidence in their 
public servants, and fail properly to scrutinize their conduct; that in this way 
they may be made the dupes of designing men, and become the instruments of 
their own undoing. Make them intelligent, and they will be vigilant; give them 
the means of detecting the wrong, and they will apply the remedy.” 
Horace Mann says, in his Lectures on Education: 
“The most momentous practical questions now before our State and country, 
are these: In order to preserve our republican institutions, must not our Common 
Schools be elevated in character, and increased in efficiency? and in order to 
bring our schools up to the point of excellence demanded by the nature of our 
institutions, must there not be a special course of study and training to qualify 
teachers for their office? No other worldly interest presents any question com-

namely, Whether the teachers of our public schools require a special course oj 
study and training to qualify them for their vocation? I solicit your attentio: 
during the residue of this address. Ishall not here insist upon any particulai

to the exclusion of all other institutions. What I insist upon is not the form, 
but the substance In treating this subject, duty will require me to speak o: 
errors and deficiencies; and of the inadequate conceptions now entertained of the 
true office and mission of a teacher, This: isa painful obligation, and in dis- 
charging it I am sure that I shall not be misunderstood by any candid and intel-| 
ligent mind, Towards the teachers of our schools—as a class—I certainly pos- 
sess none but the most fraternal feclings. Their want of adequate qualifications 
is the want of the times rather than of themselves. Teachers heretofore have 
only been partakers in a general-error—an error in which you and I, my hearers: 
have been as profoundly lust as they, Let this be their excuse heretofore, and let 
the ignorance of the past-be winked at; but the best service we can now render 
” them, is to take this excuse away, by showing the inadequacy and the unsound- 
ness of our former views.. Let all who shall henceforth sirive to do better stand 
acquitted for past delinquencies; but will not those deserve a double measure of 
condemnation who shall set themselves in array against measures which so many 
wise and good men have approved, at least until these measures have been fairly 
tested? When the tree shall have been planted long enough to mature its fruity 
then LET Ir BE KNOWN BY ITS FRUIT, 
“No one has ever supposed that an individual could build up a material temple, 
and give it strength, and convenience, and fair proportions, without mastering the 
architectural art; but we have employed thousands of teachers for our children, 
to build up the immortal temple of the spirit, who have never given to this divine 
educational art, a day nor an hour of preliminary study or attention. How often 
have we sneered at Dogberry in the play, because he holds that ‘to read and write 
comes by nature,” when we ourselves have undertaken to teach, or have employ- 
ed teachers, whose only fitness for. giving instruction, not only in reading and 
writing, BUT IN ALL OTHER THINGS, has come by nature, if it has come at all; 
that is, in exact accordance with Dogberry’s philosophy. 
“In maintaining the affirmative of this question, namely, That all teachers do 
require a special course of study and training to qualify them for their profes- 
~ sion, I will not higgle with my adversary in adjusting preliminaries. He may 
be the disciple of any school in metaphysics, and he may hold what faith he 
pleases respecting the mind’s nature and essence. Be he spiritualist or mate- 
rialist, it here’ matters not; nay, though he should deny that there is any such 
substance as mind or spirit at all, I will not stop to dispute that point with him, 
preferring rather to emulate the example of those old knights of the tuurnament, 
who felt such confidence in the justness of their cause, that they gave their adver- 
saries the advantage of the sun and wind. 
“For whatever the mind may be in its inscrutable nature or essence, or whether 
there be any such thing as mind or spirit at all, properly so called, this we have 
seen and do know, that there come beings into this world, with every incoming 
generation of children, who, although at first so ignorant, helpless, speechless, so 
incapable of all motion, upright or rotary, that we can hardly-persuade ourselves 
that they have not lost their way, and come by mistake into the wrong world
-P-A-G-E-233

yet after a few swift years have passed away, we see thousands of these same 
ignorantand helpless beings expiating horrible offenses in prison-cells, or dashing 
themselves to death against the bars of a maniac’s cage; others of them, we see 
holding ‘colloquy sublime,’ in halls where a nation’s fate is arbitrated, or solving 
some of .the mightest problems that belong to this wonderful universe; and others 
still there are, who, by daily and nightly contemplation of the laws of. God, have 
kindled that fire of divine truth in their bosoms by which they become those 
lumanaries, whose light shineth from one part of the heavens unto the other. 
And this'amazing change in these feeble and helpless creatures—this transfigu- 
ation of them for good or for evil—is wrought by laws of organization and of 
increase, as certain in their operation, and as infallible in their results as those 
by which the skillful gardener substitutes flowers, and delicious fruits, and heal- 
ing herbs, for briers, and thorns, and poisonous plants. And as we hold the 
gardener responsible for the productions of his garden, so is the community re- 
sponsible for the general character and conduct of its children, * # * * * 
“You must pardon me if on this subject I speak to you with great plainness, 
and you must allow me to appeal directly to your own course of conduct in’ other 
things You have property to be preserved for the support of your children while 
you live, or, when you die, for their patrimony; you have health and life to be 
guarded and continued, that they be not bereaved of their natural protectors; 
and you have the children themselves, with their unbounded, unfathomable capa- 
cities of happiness and misery. Now, in respect to your property, which is it 
your wont to do, when a young lawyer comes into the village, erects his sign, and 
(the most unexelusive of men) gives to the public a general invitation? Though 
he has a diploma from.a college, and the solemn approval of bench and bar, yet 
how warily do the public approach him. How much he is examined before he 
is retained.. How many premeditated plans are laid to appear to meet him acci- 
dentally to talk over indifferent subjects with him—the weather, the crops, or 
Congressional matters-—in order to measure him, and probe him, and see if there 
be any hopefullness in him. And should all things promise favorably, the young 
attorney is intrusted in the first instance only with some outlawed note, or some 
doubtful account, before a Justice of the Peace. No man ever thinks of trusting 
a case which involves the old homestead to his inexperienced hands. He would 
as soon set fire to it.’ So, too, of a young physician. No matter from what medi- 
cal college, home or foreign, he may bring his credeutials, From day to day the 
nejghbors watch him without seeming to look at him. In good-wives’ parties the 
question is confidentially discussed, whether, in a case of exigency, it would 
be safe to send for him. And when at lust he is gladdencd with a call, 
itis only to look at some surface ailment, or to PorHER a little about the extremi- 
ties. Nobody allows him to lay his unpracticed hand upon the vitals. Now, this 
common sentiment—this common practice of mankind—is only the instinctive 
dictate of prudence. It is only the tacit recognition of a truth felt by all sensible 
men that there are a thousand ways to do a thing wrong, but only one way to do 
it tight; and if it be but reasonable to exercise such -vigilance and caution in 
selecting a healer for our bodies, which perish, or a counselor for our worldly 
estates, who shall assign limits to the cireumspection and fidelity with which the 
teachers of our children should be chosen, who in the space of a few short years, 
or even months, will determine, as by a sort of. predestination upon so much of 
of their future fortunes and destiny. * * * ° *

regard to the subject-matter of his work: First, its natural properties, qualities| 
and powers; SECONDLY, the means of modifying and regulating them, with a view 
to improvement. In relation to the mechanic arts, this admitted by all. Hvery- 
body knows that the strength of the blow must be adjusted to the malleability of 
the metal. It will not do to strike glass and flint either with the same force or with 
the same implements; and, the proper instrument will never be selected by a person 
ignorant of the purpose to be effected by its use. If a man working on wood 
mistakes it for iron, and. attempts to soften it in the fire his product is—ashes. 
And so if a teacher supposes a child to have but one tendency and one adaptation, 
when he has many; if a teacher treats a child as though his nature were wholly 
animal, or wholly intellectual, or wholly moral and religious, he disfigures and 
mutilates the nature of that child, and wrenches his whole structure into de- 
formity. * * * 
“But, says an objector, can any man ever attain to such knowledge that he can 
touch as he should this ‘harp of thousand strings?” Perhaps not, I reply; but 
ask in my turn, Cannot every man know better than he now does? Cannot some- 
thing be done to make good teachers better, and incompetent ones less incom- 
petent? Cannot something be done to promote the progress, and to diminish the 
dangers of our schools? Cannot something be done to increase the intelligence 
of those female teachers to whose hands our children are committed in the earliest 
and most impressible period of childhood, and thus in the end, to secure the in- 
telligence of mothers—for every mother is ex-officio a member of the college of 
teachers? Cannot something be done by study, by discussion, by practical obser- 
vations—and especially by the institution of Normal Schools—which shall diffuse 
both the art and the science of teaching more widely through our community 
than they have ever yet been diffused? My friends, you cannot go for any con- 
siderable distance in any direction within the limits of our -beloved Common- 
wealth without passing one of those edifices professedly erected for the education 
of our children. Though rarely an architectural ornament, yet always they are 
a moral beauty to the land in which we dwell. Enter with me for a moment into 
one of those important, yet lowly mansions. Survey those thickly-seated benches, 
Before us are clustered the children of to-day, the men of to-morrow, the immor- 
tals of eternity. What costly works of art; what splendid galleries of sculpture 
or painting, won by a nation’s arms or purchased by a nation’s wealth, are com- 
parable in value to the treasures we have in these children. How many living 
and palpating nerves come down from parents and friends, and center in their 
young hearts; and as they shall advance in life, other loving and palpating 
nerves, which no man can number, shall go out from their bosoms to twine 
round other hearts, and to feel other throbs of pleasure, or of pain, or of rapture, 
or of agony. How many fortunes of others shall be linked with their fortunes, 
and shall have an equal fate. As yet to the hearts of these young beings crime 
has not brought in its retinue of fears, nor disappointment its sorrows. Their 
joys are joys, and their hopes more real than our realities; and as visions of the 
future burst upon thoir imaginations, their eye kindles like the young eagle's at 
the morning sun-beam. Grouping these children into separate circles, and look- 
ing forward for ,but a few short years to the fortunes that await them, shall we 
predict their destiny in the terrific language of the poet: 
Tuxsz shall the fury passions tear, 
The vultures of the mind,

That mocks the tear it forced to flow; 
And keen Remorse, with blood defiled, 
And moody madness Jaughing wild,

orconcentrating our whole souls into o eresolve—high and prophetically strong— 
that our duty to these children suaLz BY DONE, shall we proclaim in the blessed 
language of the Saviour, ‘It is not the will of your Father, which is in heaven, that 
one of these little ones should perish.’ ” 
Hon. Epwarp Evzrert, in an address at the opening of a Normal School, at 
Barre, Mass., said: 
“This occasion requires a few remarks on the character and objects of Normal 
Schools, and the importance of a systematic education of teachers. Much has 
been said and written of late on this subject. Not to mention foreign publications, 
itis discussed at length in the legislative reports to which I have alluded, and a 
very valuable essay by Professor Stowe on Normal Schools and Teachers’ Semin- 
aries, has recently been given to the public, The necessary limits of an address 
of this kind will require my remarks to be of a very general character. 
“The office of the teacher in forming the minds and hearts of the young, and 
training of those who are to take our places in life, is all-important. After all 
that has been said, in all ages, on the subject, more than justice has not, and 
never can be done to the theme. With no small part of the children in the com- 
munity, the intercourse of the teacher with the young is scarcely inferior in close- 
ness, and the length of time for which it is kept it, to that of the parent—not at 
all inferior in the importance of the objects to be attained by it. As soon as the 
child is old enough to be sent to school, the teacher is relied upon to furnish occu- 
pation for the opening faculties of the mind, to direct its efforts in the acquisition 
of the elements of knowledge, and to suggest the first distinct ideas on some of 
the most important questions in conduct and morals. The child is committed to 
the teacher’s hands in the early morning of life, when the character, still more 
than the young limbs, is, so to say, still in the gristle. They have, both limbs 
and character, acquired some of their proper consistency and power of resistance; 
but to how much of the intellectual and moral frames are not the first: impress 
and shaping to be given at school. Is this a light matter? If the teacher was to . 
fashion your chi d’s personal proportions, or to remould his features, with what 
jeatousy would you inquire after his qualifications for that task. Is it of less im- 
portance how he fashions and models the features of the mind? Is it of small 
account whether your child’s germinating faculties—to use a proverbial expres- 
sion to which no rhetoric. can add force—shall be ‘nipped in the bud,’ a bud in 
which the seeds of immortal life and heavenly intelligence have been curiously 
wrapped by the Creator? The husbandman can tell us if it is a matter of little or 
no importance whether you employ a skillful or an unskillful person to raise a 
crop of corn, the growth of a few months under a simple process of culture. And 
yet so much depends on proper management, that from the same seed you may 
see in one field the corn towering, vigorous, swelling into life and strength, its

broad and healthy leaves crackling till the farmer thinks he can both hear ita 
see it grow; the graceful tassel dancing on the summit of the stalk and droppi 
its fertilizing powder on the silken filaments, which force their way from the top 
the husk to receive the vita) principle, and carry it to the ripening ear; and, pe} 
haps, on the other side of the way, in a corner of the sluggard’s garden, stru; 
gling with rank weeds for the joint possession of the encumbered soil, you wi 
ace from the same seed, a scanty, blighted, sickly crop, yellow as saffron, when 
ought to be green, and black when it ought to be yellow, and scarce promising 
few meagre stalks for the barn-yard. Whenever I witness such a contrast in the 
. natural world, I ask myself, with trembling, Whether the mind is a principle 5 
niuch less delicate than a blade of grass; whether the proper care and culture o: 
the intellect, the raising up and the training up of that unspeakable mystery on] 
earth, a thinking, # reasoning, discerning, immortal creature, are so inferior in 
importance, in difficulty, and in the amount of the consequences involved, that 
while we would trust the tillage of our fields, the sowing of our-corn, and the 
gathering of the harvest only to an expert and a judicious hand, any one may 
be trusted to keep our schools and cultivate the minds of our children? These in- 
quiries scarcely need an answer. Every man’s reflection, who is able to reason 
on. the subject, every one’s observation who has turned his attention to it, every 
one’s experience who has had children of his own confided toa succession of 
teachers, and still more, who has at any time himself been engaged in the busi- 
ness of instruction, will satisfy himself that the teacher's duty is important, com- 
plicated, and arduous. It is not a mere piece of job work to which any one may 
turn his hand, but-a professional calling, which requires knowledge and experi- 
ence. There is scarce a thing conceivable as even a solitary act, consisting of 
several paris or movements, which does not admit of every degree of excellence 
in the manner and'sense.of the performance. Sce two men handle an axe in cut- 
ting dewn a tree, one.a new hand, the other a practical woodsman, ‘Look at two

illustrations of the necessity of diligent preparation of every calling; and no one 
can seriously suppose that the office of instructor makes an exception, But inas- 
much as institutions for the education of teachers are as yet hardly known by 
Dame among us, it is a natural question, how teachers in our country have hither- 
to been able to prepare themselves for the discharge of their duties. May not 
the means which have hitherto proved adequate for the supply of our schools with

answer, “Whoever considers that of the teachers in times past and at the present 
day in our schools, thera are those possessing .all degrees of qualifications from 
very high to. very low, it will seem « pertinent inquiry, what their source of _pre- 
paration has been; and such an inquirer will probably be of opinion that. we need 
amore systematic and. efficient preparation for this purpose. "We must assume, 
then, first, that natural aptitude goes very far on the plan hitherto pursued in de- 
ciding the qualifications of the teacher. . This, under the. circumstances, will be 
an important element, One man will be a better teacher with little or no train- 
ing or experience, than some others who pass their. lives in the business. This, 
however, is, equally. the case in every pursuit or calting—in law, physic, and 
divinity ; in trade, manufactures and farming—and is never thought to supersede 
the necessity of education. Some remain inefficient and incapable after every 
imaginable adyantage;.others with slender opportunities, bound as it were at.a 
single leap to the front rank. 1 have seen a person who, from his infancy, never 
knew a want;, who passed from the arms of a careful nurse into the care of the 
best teachers; who.enjoyed, from the first, every couceivable aid and encourage- 
ment (excepé the mast efficient of all, the spur of necessity,) the best of masters, 
the best of books in abundance, and steady schooling, and at theclose of his school 
education grossly ignorant.in every branch of knowledge; while another of the 
same age, educated under the stern discipline of necessity, with limited means, 
the ordinary chance of instructors, the old books which his father wore out before 
him, and attendance at school far from steady, has advanced from one branch to 
nother, mastering each as he goes, with a keen relish for learning and an ever- 
craving appetite for new truth. Whatever may be the calling of. these two men, 
one is destined to eminence, the other to-failure. Should circumstances call them 
to the instructor's desk it is quite evident that he who haa learned little will have- 
still less to teach, while the other will be very likely to exhibit the same facility in. 
the communication as in the acquisition of knowledge. In the next place the: 
teacher's fitness, at the preseat day, depends very much on the kind of instruction, 
which he received himself while at school. If he was so fortunate as to be taught. 
by a sound, accurate, judicious instructor, he will be not unlikely to exhibit that 
character himself. A good degree of the school-keeping capacity, and I may say: 
algo,incapacity, are traceable to this source. wos 
“Our schools.are under a kind of traditionary discipline. To a considerable. 
extent they are kept hy young men and women who make a pretty rapid transi-. 
tion from the pupil’s bench to the teacher's and mistress’ chair, Unless they 
possess strong, original minds,—which are not ,very common,—there is not much: 
likelihood that they will rise.above the standard of the schools where they were- 
themselves taught. If these were very good they will be more apt to fall: below-its. 
Mediocrity is much more apt to be propagated than excellence. If.a teacher of 
average capacity keep the school for a few years, he will not be likely. to make any: 
improvements, and will do very well if he hands it over to his successor as good as 
he found it. When this state of things prevails in a community for a long course 
of years, we behold the. painful spectacle of schools in the rear of everything else, 
There is progress,in everything else, but the schools are degenerating. I have 
heard judicious observers express the doubt whether the ayerage of.our district 
schools are better at the present day than they. were thirty years ago. If the 
remark is just, it isa state of things not very creditable to. the commonwealth, 
To keep pace with the general progress of improvement.they ought to be much bet- 
ter. We should be ashamed to be quoted hereafter as a proof that there is a law .

in the intellectual and moral, like that which has been observed in the natural world 
with respect to’many of the products of theearth—that the fruit that is borne on the 
graft runs out on the original stock, Good husbandry requires that attention should 
be given to the discovery of improved methods, and the introduction of new vari- 
eties raised from seed. Tradition is closely allied to degeneracy. 
“Where the teacher engages in his pursuit for life, a new source of qualification 
presenisitself of great value: .I mean experience, He qualifies himself. Butsuch 
teachers are not found, I presume, in many of our common schools. They rise to 
higher stations. Besides this, is may happen when Experience is the teacher, as 
with teachers of other kinds, the pupil is by no means sure to excel his master. 
Self-instruction is not always ‘improving. It depends on the character of a man’s 
mind how mich advantage he derives from experience. The experience of one man 
is clear and decisive. He commits:an error, perceives it, and henceforward avoids 
it. Ie is struck with the advantage of some procedure or method, traces that ad- 
vantage to its principle, builds a rule upon it, and enlarges or amends bis practice 
to the end of life. The experience of other men yields.them no-such fruit.. It is 
vague and irresolute, They live and act, but have no experience, properly so-called. 
Proceeding without steady principles. of conduct, without the intelligence or the 
moral aptitude to profit by their mistakes, the working of one day cuunteracts 
that of another. [It is only when order, the first law of earth ag well as heaven, 
presides, that day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night showeth forth 
knowledge. Without this guide of conduct, experience may perplex instead of di- 
recting. The mistake of to-day produces the mistake of to-morrow, and life is ex- 
hausted in half-finished experiments and constantly repeated blunders, so that 
whether a man’s experience profit him depends upon whether it is good experience, 
which may be either successful experience or unsuccessfol experience, wisely heeded; 
and it may often happen that the recorded experience of another more judicious 
mind will in réality, guide a.man better than his own. * * * & 
“We are thys brought to the necessity of some specific preliminary preparation 
for the office of teacber—a preparation which shall fit him in-some degree befare- 
hand for his duties. “To afford this-proparation is the principal object of the Nor- 
mal School, Nothing is further from my purpose than to set up the pretension that 
there can be no well qualified teachers without such’ school, but that great ad_

provement, on which the faithful teacher must exciusively depend. ‘To afford this 
instruction is the object of the Normal Schools now established in the Common- 
wealth. It.is impossible that it. should be so thorough and comprehensive as the 
theory of a perfect institution of this kind requires. There are no funds app.ica- 
ble to the expense of such an establishment ; and our young men and women could 
not well afford the time requsite for a very long course of preparation, because the 
majority of our districts do not require and would not support teachers who, hav- 
ing been at great expense of time and money in fitting themselves for their calling, 
would need a proportionate compensation. We suppose that many who resort. to 
these ‘institutions will at present be able to pass but part of one year in the en- 
joyment of these advantages; but while provision is made for the shortest time for 
which any individual could reasonably wish to be received, a thorough course of 
instruction will also be arranged for those who desire'to devote a longer time to 
their preparation as teachers, Such a course of instruction will obviously consist 
of the following parts:
-P-A-G-E-239
. , LXXXUL 
1. Accareful review of the branches of knowledge required to be taught in our 
common schools ; it beitig of course the first requisite of a teacher that he should 
himself know well that which-he is to aid others in learning, Such an acquaint- 
ance with these branches of knowledge is much less common than may be gene- 
rally supposed. “The remarks may seem paradoxical, but I believe it will bear ex- 
auination, when Isay that a teacher thoroughly versed in those branches of knowl- 
edge only which are taught at our common schools is #8 difficult to find as a first- 
rate lawyer, divine, or physician, statesman, man of business, or farmer. A good 
schoolmaster should be able to read and speak the English language with. proprie- 
ty, ease and grace; and this cannot be done without a thorough knowledge of its 
grammar. He should possess at the same time, a clear, shapely and rapid hand- 
writing, and be well versed in the elementary principles of numbers. uO 
Without going beyond these three branches—best designated by the good old 
names of reading, writing and arithmetic—I venture to say that a man who pos- 
sesses them thoroughly is as rare as one of corresponding eminence in any of the 
learned professions. And yet the law requires such masters of our district schools. 
What says the statute? ‘Iu every town containing fifty families or householders, 
there shall he kept in each year, at the charge of the town, by a teacher or teach- 
ers of competent abilities and good morals, a school for the instruction of children 
in orthography, reading, writing, English grammar, geography, arithmetic and good 
behavior” How feweven of those conceded men of good education are thoroughly — 
versed even in the branches required by law in our common schools? How much 
fewer who know them as a teacher should know them—for a teacher dught to know 
of everything much more than the learner can be expected to acquire. The teacher 
must know things in.a masterly way—curiously, nicely, and in their reasons. 
* * * * * x * * * * 
2, The second part of instruction ina Normal School is ihe art of teaching, 
To know the matter to be taught, and to know it thoroughly, are of themselves, 
though essential, not all that is required. There is a peculiar art of teaching. 
The details of this branch are inexhaustible; but it is hoped that the most import- 
ant principles may be brought within such a compass as to afford material benefit 
to those who pass even the shortest time at these institutions. The subject should 
be taken up at its foundation, in those principles of our nature on which education 
depends; the laws which control the faculties of the youthful mind in the pursuit 
and attainment of truth; and the moral sentiments on the part of the pupil which 
must be brought into harmonious action. The future teacher must be instructed 
in the most eff.ctual way of teaching the untaught mind—a process subtle, difficult 
aud varivus. The first thing requisite often will be to ascertain what has to beun~ 
Jearned, both as to positive errors and bad habits of mind. The child who hag 
been accustomed to add numbers together by counting numbers on his fingers in- 
atead of learning a simple addition table by rote at the outset; who has formed to 
himself a small, ill-looking and illegible scrawl, under the name of a running hand, 
without even having learned to shape the letters in bold and fair proportions; or 
who, under the notion of refinement, beyond the common standard, has been taught 
such barbarisms as “‘he shew me the book;” “I have began to read it;” “had I have 
had time to go;” such a child, I say, comes into the hands of the teacher heavily 
laden with a cargo which it must be the first labor and care of the teacher to throw 
overboard. But the art of teaching is not confined to the correction of the errors 
or the reform of the bad habits of the untaught pupil. When nothing of this kind 
is to be done, the mind of the learner is still to be guided, aided and managed in its
-P-A-G-E-240
LXXXIV 
progress. The perfection of the art of teaching consists in hitting the precise 
point between that which the studious pupil must do for himself and that which 
the instructor may do with and for him. It is not enough in teaching a child to 
read, to correct with a harsh voice some gross error which he may make in reading 
averse or two in the New Testament or the National Reader. The teacher must 
himself patiently, kindly, and with a gentle voice, read the passage over repeat- 
edly and see that the learner understands the meaning of every word and of the 
whole sentence, It is peculiar to arithmetic that though there are degrees of read~ 
iness in performing its operations, there are no degrees of clerrness and certainty 
in the knowledge of principles. The incredible vexation which attends the study 
of this branch with many children generally arises from the unskillfulness of the 
teacher in not taking care that the learner, as he goes along, understands thor- 
oughly each successive step. If this be done, the child of ten years old will know 
what he knows at all as well as Sir Isaac Newton, Some simple schoolboy muse 
in. former times has recorded his sorrowful experience on this subject in the follow- 
ing plaintive, and in my day, very popular strain :— 
Multiplication is vexation, 
Division is as bad, 
'Phe rale of three doth puzzle me, 
And practice makes me mad. 
But if. proper care be taken that every step be thoroughly understood before ad- 
vancing to the next, multiplication and division will be found as simple as addi- 
tion and subtraction, while the rule of three and practice have been shown in the 
recent and beat school books to be wholly unnecessary, inasmuch as all questions 
usually performed by their aid can be more readily performed by simple processes. 
One thing is certain—that there can be no difference in the average capacity of 
equal numbers of children in two schools in the same county. There is often a 
vast difference in the average scholarship, after the same amount of schooling, To 
what can the difference be ascribed but to the different degrees of skill on the part 
of teachers? It is not an uncommon thing to find children who, after having been 
months and even years employed either on the lower elements or on the higher 
branches of learning, leaving school at last knowing nothing thoroughly, and not 
much superficially. They cannot read with fluency, force and intelligence, to say 
nothing of grace and beauty. They write a poor, unsteady, hieroglyphical hand; 
they have no clear notion of grammatical construction, and are awkward and in- 
correct in the use of numbers, Perhaps this is the description of nearly half of 
the children who leave school in town or country. The little that is learned of 
Latin and Greek is equally inacurate and shal'ow. The fault is commonly laid to 
the pupil’s dulness, especially if he has had what is commonly called schooling 
enough, I think, however, generally, that the fault is with the teacher, who is fre- 
quently not thoroughly versed himself in what he attempts to teach—more fre- 
quently unskilled in the art of teaching. The astonishing difference sometimes 
noticed in the progress in the same school under different teachers in successive 
seasons, shows how much is justly attributable to this canse. Besides the gen- 
eral art of teaching, there are peculiar methods applicable to each branch of knowl- 
edge, which should be unfolded in the instructions of a Normal School. But this 
is a topic in which my limits do not permit me to engage. 
8. The third branch of instruction to be imparted in an institution which con. 
cerns the important subject of the government of the school, and which might per- 
haps have been named the first. The best method of governing a school—that is
-P-A-G-E-241
LXXXV 
of exercising such a moral influence in it as is most favorable to the improvement 
of the pupils—will form a very important part of thecourse of instruction designed 
to qualify teachers for their calling. Itis this part of their duty which is least 
considered by themselves or their employers, for the reason, perhaps, that qualifica- 
tion in this respect is the least capable of being estimated by external standard. 
But how much is not implied in the words “to govern a school?” For several 
hours in the day the teacher is to exercise the suthority of a parent over fifty or 
sixty, perhaps over ninety or a hundred children. Parents can form au opinion 
whether this is a'task to be executed without system and without principle and as a 
matter of course, or whether it is not that of which the youthful teacher will stand 
most in need of all the preparation which it is possible to acquire. Without the 
aid of that instinct of natural affection which perfects paternal authority, he is 
expected, with a parent’s power, to control alike the docile and the obstinate, the 
sullen and the gay. While his entire intercourse with his pupils is that of con- 
straint and requisition, he must acquire an absolute control over many a youthfut 
spirit which has already been irritated by caprice, soured by tyranny, or spoiled 
by indulgence at home. Andhe is to do this, not by violence and storm, but by 
wisely threading the maze of that living labyrinth, the affections of the youthful 
heart. In this department perhaps greater improvement has of late years taken 
place than in any other; there has been a general call for moral influence 
rather than for physical power. Ido not say that this last should never be re- 
sorted to, but I trust that the day is forever past for.the ferocious warfare he- 
tween master and pupil which was once so common, and with no other effect than 
that of turning the teacher’s office into a hateful tyranny, and the happy season of 
childhood into a long martyrdom. Dr. Johnson, in composing a legal argument to 
be used by another person, puts into his mouth the sentiment “that a school can 
be governed only by fear.” It would, I think, have been much nearer the truth to 
say that a school can be governed only by patient, enlightened Christian love, the 
master principles of our nature. It softens the ferocity of savages; it melts the 
felon in bis cell, In the management of children it is the great source of influence; 
and the teacher of youth, though his mind is a storehouse of knowledge, is igno- 
rant of the first principles of his art if he has not embraced this as an elemental 
maxim. But let it not be thought that these are smooth sayings, and that moral 
discipline is unattended with difficulty and preferred by an indolent age for its 
comparative ease. The reverse is nearer the truth. To walk the round of the 
school with aratan in the hand to be bestowed as liberally on the thoughtless exu- 
berance of youthful spirits; on the restlessness of the little urchin unused to his’ 
confinement, and on the mistake of mere inadvertance or absolute ignorance ag on 
hardened perversity and resolute disobedience, is a much easier task than to grad- 
uate each of these cases on the scale of moral demerit and to treat them accord- 
ingly. Itis related of the late Dr. Bowditch that he very early manifested that skill 
in numbers which afterward raised him to the level of the first mathematicians of 
the day. Whilé quite a child at school he performed a difficult sum in arithmetic 
with astonishing readiness. His schoolmaster was at once so ignorant of the mode 
of governing a school, and was so little himself with the powers of his pupil’s mind 
that he thought it impossible that the task should have been performed with- 
out assistance, and asked who had helped him. On being told by young Bowditch 
thaé he had done it himself, the coarse tyrant severely chastised him for falsehood; 
a treatment well calculated to subvert the entire moral frame of a sensitive lad,
-P-A-G-E-242
LXXXVI 
but much more simple than it would have been for an understanding such as thi 
master possessed to enter into a careful analysis of the capabilities of his forwar 
pupil, The instruction of the Normal Schools will, therefore, dwell on the govern 
ment of youth as of paramount importance; as that part of the teacher's dut, 
which demands the rarest union of qualities; which most tries the teacher, and 
will add when faithfully and judiciously performed, is most important in its results. 
Give me the child who has embraced, without violence, the gentle love 
in whom the sprightliness of youth has not encroached on deference 
and I would rather have him for my son, though at the age of twelv 
have his alphabet to learn, than be compelled to strugglé with the caprive us) 
a self-willed, obstinate youth whose bosom has become a viper’s nest of the unamiable 
passions, although in early attainments he may bé the wonder of the day. There 
are many other topics connected with the teacher’sduty on which it may be expected 
that instruction will be afforded in the Normal School. Among these is the import- 
-ant subject of direct instruction in morals and religion, the relation of teachers 
and parents, of teachers and tho higher school authorities, and the duties.of teach- 
ers to each other and to the community, and the community to them as members of 
a respectable profession. I am necessarily prevented by the limits of the occasion 
from entering upon any of these subjects. * * * *

Opinion of Hon. Anson Smyth, Late Common School Commis’r of Ohio. 
Has a teacher the legal right to open his school with prayer? 
On this extremely délicate and important matter I have not been‘able to find 
any decision of the Supreme Court of this State. But in the State of New York 
it has been decided, under a school law similar to that of this State, that “ teach- 
ers‘may open and close their school with prayer and ‘the reading of the Scrip- 
tures, provided they take care to avoid all controverted - points or sectarian 
dogmas,” 
In ‘some States it has been held that teachers cannot claim this right as a mat- 
‘ter of course, but that school officers may, in the exercise of a sound discretion, 
permit them to open and close their schools with prayer, provided the inhabit- 
ants of the districts do not seriously object; and provided also that the harmony 
of the district would not seriously be disturbed thereby. 
If the teacher in his prayers avoids all sectarian dogmas and does not improp- 
erly consume time, I do not see why he may not be permitted to do what he be- 
lievés to be his conscientious duty for the welfare of those committed to his 
charge, by appropriately invoking the blessing of God upon his important and 
responsible labors, as by properly addressing or lecturing his pupils upon the 
importance of a'strict adherence to the principles of truth, justice, and morality. 
But the teacher should not insist on this privilege, nor should, the local Direct- 
ors grant it, in cases where it would create dissatisfaction in the district, or in- 
duce a, portion of the inhabitants to withdraw their children from school, because 
of sincere conscientious scruples on the subject, ° 
‘The question as to the right of opening a school with prayer is one of great del-
-P-A-G-E-243
. LXXXVII 
icacy, and should be treated accordingly. In a matter of such grave character, 
involving the interests of religion, the freedom of conscience, and a sense of duty, 
school officers, teachers, and the inhabitants ‘generally, should exercise great for- 
bearance and a spirit of conciliation, John O. Spencer, one of the most distin- 
guished jurists in the State of New York, while acting as Superintendent of Com- 
mon Schools.in that State, decided a similar question as follows, viz.: “Prayers 
cannot-form any part of the school exercises, or be regulated by the school dis- 
cipline.. If had at all, they should be had before the usual hour of commencing 
school inthe morning, and after the hour of closing school. in the afternoon. - If 
any parente are desirous of habituating their children to the practice of thanking 
their Oreator for his protection during the night, and invoking his blessings on 
the labors of the day, they have a right to place them under the charge of the 
teacher for that purpose. But neither they nor the teacher have any authority 
to conipel. the children. of other ‘parents, who object, to. the practice, ftom 
dislike of the individual or his creed, or from any. other cause, to unite in 
such, prayers, 
“And, on the other hand, the latter have no right to obstruct the former i inthe 
discharge of what they deems sacred duty. Both’ parties have rights; ‘and it is 
only by aimutual and reciprocal regard by each of the rights of the other, that 
peace can be maintained, or a school flourish, The teacher may assemble in his 
schoolroom, before nine o'clock, the children of those parents who.desire him to 
conduct religious exercises for them; and the children of those who object to 
the. practice will be allowed: to retire or absent themselves. from the room. If 
they persist in, remaining there, they must conduct with the decorum and pro- 
priety becoming the-occasion. If they do not so conduct, they may be dealt 
with as: intruders.” 
In the same State, it was held by General John ‘A. Dix, an eminent statesman 
and jurist; that “the teachor of a school may open it'with prayer, provided he does 
not encroach on the hours allotted for instruction, and provided the attendance of 
the scholars ia not exacted as a matter of school discipline.” . ~ 
Ina case-which came beforé- Henry S, Randall, Superintendent, and which set 
forth that ine certain Common School “the religion and faith of. Catholic chil- 
dren were interfered with by thelr being- compelled to ‘join in prayers, and ‘to 
read and commit’ portions of a version of the Bible which the Uatholic Church 
disapproves,” he says: In theory, I-have never -been able to doubt that intellect- 
ugl and religious instruction shoyld go hand in hand. To divorce them entirely, 
and to bestow attention on the former only,.is to draw forth and add to the powers 
of the mind, without giving any moral helm-to-guide it; in other words, it is to 
increase the capacity without diminishing the propensity to do evil. To banish 
religious eduction from the schools is, in a multitude of instances, fo consign it 
to the care of the vicious, the ignorant, the careless, or those who feel that they 
have no time to attend to it. The placing of it in its: natural connection with in- 
tellectual education in the schoolroom; has met, howaver, in our country, with 
serious practical-obstacles. 
“The government not relying. on the ability or willingness of every part of the 
State to'maintain efficient schools for the. edueation of. the young; by voluntary 
contributions, and recognizing the imperative nevessity of universal education 
for the maintenance of our civil and political institutions, organized a general Com- 
mon School system, and made provisions to aid those sending to school, in sustain- 
ing it, by the pdyrhent of a large sum annually fromthe treasury. To prevent this
-P-A-G-E-244
LXXXVIII 
money from being misapplied, it prescribes the conditions on which it shall b 
received and expended; and it created a special State officer, with administrativ 
and judicial powers, towcarry out and enforce the system.. The Common Schools 
were thus clearly made a government institution. To introduce into them, or 
permit to be-introduced into them, a course of religious itistruction conformable 
to the views of any religious denomination, would be tantamount to the adoption 
of a government religion—a step contrary to the Constitution and equally at 
variance with the policy of a free government and the wishes of the people. To 
form for the-schools a course of instruction which could bear the name of a relig- 
ons gneyand which would moet the views of all, was manifestly impossible. To 
. give every sect a pro rata share of the school moneys to enable it to support its 
. own schools, and teach its own system of religious faith in them, would be to 
‘divide into a dozen or more schools the children within the territory convenient for 
attendance on a single school, and in which the ‘support:of all the inhabitants 
is frequently scarcely adequate, with the aid of public moneys, to sustain a single 
efficieat school, Indeed, under this arrangement, a single indigent family would 
often be required to support its own school, to go without any, or to violate its 
conscience by joining with others in one-in which a religious system was taught 
wholly at variance with its own. There are other reasons which have gone to 
convince the public mind of the impracticability of carrying out such a plan so 
as to.attain the object sought—the education of ali the people—which do not re- 
quire enumeration. 
“Tn view of the above facts, the position was early, distinctly, and almost uni- 
versally.taken by our statesmen, legislators, and prominent friends of education 
—men of the warmest religious zeal, and belonging to every religious sect—that 
the instruction in our public schools should be limited to that ordinarily included 
under the head of intellectual culture, and to the inculcation of those general 
principles of morality in which all sects, and good men belonging to no sect, can 
equally agree. - : 
“We have seen that even prayer—that morning and evening duty which a man 
owes to his Creator—which even the pagan and savage do not withhold from the 
gods of their blind devotion—which, conducted in any proper spirit, is no more 
sectarian than that homage which constantly goes up from ‘all nature, animate 
and inanimate, to the bountiful giver of all things—has been decided by two 
eminent jurists .as inadmissible as a school exercise within the school hours, when 
seriously and conscientiously objected to by any-portion of the inhabitants of a 
school district. > . : : . 
“This decision has been acquiesced in without a murmur, by the whole religious 
public. The intelligent religious public have felt that there was no. middle ten- 
able ground between. religious instraction—strictly so calied—in our Commen 
Schools, and the broadest toleration. . not : 
“Compelied by circumstances to adopt the latter position, they have embraced 
it in its most comprehensive import, and have nerved themselves to the task of 
supplying a lamentable omission in the public schools, by increased agsiduity to 
the spiritual wants of their offspring in the family circle, in the Sunday-school, 
and in the church. In our crowded cities, where poverty sinks to its lowest ebb, and vice puts on its most unmitigated forms, where multitudes of children would 
Teceive no religious instruction from or through the instrumentality of their Parents, voluntary church and individual organizations are putting forth their endeavors to supply such instruction. Many, doubtless, are not reached by these
-P-A-G-E-245
LXXXIX 
efforts; nor would they be reached if religion was taught in the Common Schools, 
for the children of the extremely poor and the vicious oftentimes could not or 
would not, attend them.’” .

Result of Educational Reform in Massachusetts during Twenty Years 
after Commencement of Educational Reform. 
  
Rerort or Hon, G. T. Bourwenn. 
|. Her population has increased from 691,222 in 1887, to 1,182,688 in 1855; and 
the valuation of the State has risen from $200, 457,662 in 1830 to $597,986, 955 i in 
1850, The annual productive power of the State has increased more rapidly even 
than its accumulated capital or its population. In 1887 the production of Massa- 
chusects was $86,282,616, equal to one hundred and twenty-four dollars for each
-P-A-G-E-247
XCI 
man, woman and child within our boundries. And even as recently as 1845, the 
average production did not exceed one hundred and fifty dollars per annum, So then 
it may be said that the State annually produces an amount nearly equal to fifty 
per cent, of ifs aggregate capital, or one-half of what remains of the labors of 
eight generations of men. And it is to be borne in mind that this inerease has 
been attained without a corresponding increase in prices; indeed in many depart- 
ments.of industry the prices of manufactured articles have “beeri reduced. At 
some points we can connect this material prosperity with the intellectual culture 
of the people; but it would be unjust to claim: for the public schools the.exclusive 
merit which so great a change implies. But their important agency in this work 
cannot be denied.. They have not only furnished education to all who have chosen 
to accept it, but they have furnished in the dopartment called High Schools, a het- 
ter practical education than could have been obtained thirty years ago, in any in- 
stitution in Massachusetts. In this period labor hag been revolutionized It is no 
longer, in its leading characteristics, a manual process, but is in its force and 
value, essentially intellectual. Upon the land, for two hundred years, the processes 
of agriculture were exhaustive, the mind not often devising means by which com- 
pensation could be made for what the hands removed and the bodies consumed ; 
while now we behold a system of agriculture annually more and ‘more promising 
in the accumulated power which is to yield yet richer harvests in the future. In 
like manner the-prosperity of the mills and shops is based quite as much upon the 
intellectual vigor as upon. the physical power of the laborers. Labor is not imita- 
tive, merely,—it is inventive, creative. The laborer is no longer servile, yielding to 
laws and necessities that he cannot comprehend, and therefore canno'trespect; but he 
has been elevated to the regions of art and works by laws that he appreciates, and 
aspires to a perfection as real, at least, as that of the sculptor, painter, or poet. 
An uneducated people have but few wants and no excess of means;, but. intellec- 
tual culture creates additional wants, and provides for their satisfaction; and it 
must always happen that the variety and extent of comforts enjoyed, and the sur- 
plus productions of a State, are in proportion to the general intelligence. The 
laws of labor are the laws that exist, and are recognized in art, eloquence and 
science, .The great law of this latter unquestionably is that every student shall be 
at the same time an original thinker, investigator, designer and producer. If the 
artist is a producer merely, he is necessarily an imitator, and the art itself is not 
advanced by his agency. So, if the laborer is, a producer merely, he does some- 
thing, no doubt, to sustain the present order of things, but he makes no contribu- 
tion to the world’s progress. 
Massachusetts, from her history and position, i is necessarily a manufacturing and 
commercial State. These pursuits are entirely dependent upon the culture. of. the 
intellect. The invention of machinery demands a high order of learning, and the 
best machinery becomes impotent in the hands of the ignorant. Commeree, then, 
depends for materials of its growth and prosperity on the intelligence of the labor- 
ing classes—upon the land, and in the shops and mills. Thus we connect the pro- 
ductive-power of our State with its institutions of learning. -These twenty years 
have been marked by a continuous effort to give to every-child the intellectual cul- 
ture that ig essential to a thinking, inventive, creative, virtuous life of honorable 
labor... The partial success attained has wrought out results that seem credible 
only because they are baged upon careful personal and local examination. In 1837 
the cities and towns of the State raised by taxation, for teachers’ wages, board, 
and incidental expenses, the sum of $887,124.17, while in 1855 the sum of $1,218,- 
et
-P-A-G-E-248
XOIr 
958.55 was appropriated for the same purposes. There has been in this item of 
expenditure an annual increase amounting in the aggregate to the vast sum of 
$826,829.88, In 1837 the appropriation for each child between the ages of five and 
fifteen years, was $2.15, and in 1855 it was $5.48, an increase of one hundred and 
nine percent. In 1840 the appropriation was $3.19, in 1845 it was $3.60, in 1850 
. $4.71, and in 1850 it amounted to $5.48 for each child in the Commonwealth be- 
tween the ages of five and fifteen years. In 1837 the property of the State was 
equal to $293 for each inhabitant, in 1840 to $406, in 1850 to $600, and in 1855 
it was not less than $7.90, or an increase of one hundred per cent. in twenty years. 
It is thus seen that the increase of appropriations in this branch of expenditure 
has excelled the increase of capital in the State nine per cent. The facts already 
stated, also show that the productive power of each individual has increased one 
hundred and eleven per cent. since 1887; and from the entire view presented we 
are able to deduce the yet more remarkable truth that the appropriations for the 
education of each child, the accumulation of capital, and the annual individual 
productive power of our people have been promoted in corresponding ratio. In 
1855 the cities and towns expended in erecting and repairing school-houses for the 
use of the public schogls the sum of $588,213.55; while in 1887 the expenditures 
upon school-houses did not exceed $80,000, thus showing the remarkable difference 
between the two years of over half a million of dollars. In April, 1854, the 
School Committees appraised the public school-houses at $4,576,457.26, and after 
allowing for additions, and making also reasonable deductions for depreciations, 
they must now possess an intrinsic value of more than five millions of dollars. 
This array of figures does not present a perfect idea of the nature and extent of 
the change that has been effected, yet it may produce the impression that less re- 
mains to be done than the facts warrant. Mr. Mann, in his third annual report, 
says: 
“ By what 1 have learned from authentic sources, and have seen in three annual 
circuits through all parts of the Commonwealth, respecting its three thousand 
school-houses, I am convinced that there is no other class of buildings within our 
limits, erected either for the permanent or the temporary residence of our native 
population, so uncomfortable, so dangerous to health by their construction within, 
or so unsightly and repulsive in their appearance without, * * * # *% # * 
I do not think that there are more than one hundred of the three thousand school- 
houses in the State erected, at all superior, even if equal to that of the very poorest 
public building of any other kind in the very poorest and most sparsely populated 
portions of the Commonwealth. Leaving the city of Boston out of the account, 
it would be easy to select a hundred churches, which the parents have built for 
themselves, worth all the three thousand school-houses, collectively, which they 
have built for their children.” 
In 1848 Mr. Mann estimated the value of school houses in the State at $2,750,000, 
and also that $2,200,000 of that sum had been raised subsequently to the Report on 
school-houses and schocl-house architecture, made by the Board of Education in 
1838. From these statements we gather the opinion that the three thousand school- 
houses in Massachusetts, in 1888, had an aggregate value of $550,000, or some- 
thing less than $200 each. Upon the assumption supplied by the number of stu- 
dents entered, that there were 4,000 school-houses in the State in 1855, their ayer- 
age value would be $1,250. But, however this may be, we are aunually expending 
upon school-houses a sum of money equal to the entire investment twenty years 
ago; and within $1,000,000 of the whole expenditure from 1839 to 1843, inclusive.
-P-A-G-E-249

But it should be observed in this connection, that the change has not been univer- 
sal. There are towns where the description given by Mr. Mann is as applicable 
as it ever was in the history of the State, and vastly more discreditable to those 
who permit the witnesses of their indifference to testify continually against the 
public sentiment and wisdom. But the work of regeneration is going on; and 
what was true of the entire State twenty years ago is now true of a few localities 
only.. In the cities and many of the towns, both great.and small, the work of re- 
formation bas been radical and complete. But there are, after all, important sec- 
tions and classes of people whose sense of duty in this matter is to be quickened, 
whose courage is to be increased, whose faith is to be stimulated, that they may 
join heartily in ‘removing the evidences that now remain of a dark period in 
our educational history. The reports of the various committees are filled with val- 
uable testimony upon two points; first the marked and uninterrupted progress of 
the last twenty years, and second, the necessity for uninterrupted effort in the 
same work until every dilapidated, inconveient, unhealthy structure has given 
place to a commodious, tasteful and inviting school-house.

GENERAL CIRCULAR.   
[This Cireular will be sené to many persons whose letters it has been impossible to answer, It inclades so many topics of inquity, that 1 hope it will be read by eve Superintendent. Dit reetor and Teacher in the State. “It should be remembered that with all the manifold duties of this officecorresponddenco, accounts, instructions, travel, attendanee upon meetings, ad- dresses, settlement of difficult questions, keeping the light'of other educational systems on the Tennessee system--the only assistance provided by Jaw is that of the State Librarian, who is alse shepister for the State, and who has énough for ‘one man to do either as Librarian or gister. 
STATE OF TENNESSEE, 
Orrick SUPERINTENDENT PuBiic InsTRUCTION, 
Nasuvinte, July 3, 1869, Dear Sir: 
The Scholastic Census for this year should have been taken in May, as 
required by law.‘ Each year should find all officers of the free school system, if 
possible, more prompt and successful in the discharge of their duties. 
The better they are discharged, the sooner the system will be understood and ap- 
preciated, and the easier all educational requirements will be found. It will be- 
come, as it should be, one of the most agreeable, as it is one of the most useful 
duties, to care for the training of the young. . 
The taking of the census, or any other annually recurring requirement, should 
not be irksome, when it is seen with the accomplishment of what public good it is 
associated, . : 
Superintendents’ Salaries The Board of School Fund Commissioners, com- 
posed of the Governor, Secretary of State, Comptroller, Treasurer and Superin- 
tendent of Public Instruction, in May, fixed the salary at three dollars per diem 
for the timeof County Superintendents actually spent in the discharge of official du- 
ties. Accounts in the future will be made out at this rate, and will be approved 
when sent here, Each six months’should be made out separately. 
Time of their Services.—The number of days for which the allowance is 
made is approved by the Executive Board of the County.
-P-A-G-E-250
xXCcIV 
If the records of the Superintendent’s office are kept as the blanks from this 
office indicate, the Board will have no trouble in knowing exactly the number of 
days of his service; for. what he has done each day will appear. 
The labor required in different counties differs greatly, Some organize and go 
forward with their schools with little opposition: Others do not move without 
monthe of the hardest labor by the Superintendent. 
The Superintendent will do well to consult with the Directors of his county, es- 
pecially with the members of the Executive Board, in regard to the time desirable 
to spend in doing his duties, Their intelligent sympathy and approval would be 
specially valuable: Great economy of effort can be exercised by County Superin- 
tendents. 
Set days for examinations, If the answers are written—which is the best 
method—« large number can be examined at the same time. By having particular 
days to be at the county seat and the- ‘principal places of business, many persons 
can be seen and much business done in a single day, that would require days of 
travel. County meetings of the Directors ‘will be exceedingly useful. 
In visiting schools it is desirable that the neighborhood should know the day the 
Superintendent will be present, and attend with him and comparé views; certainly 
the Directors should bé present to confer. 
The strictest system in. the county office will greatly relieve this office of its 
overwhelming duties. Much economy of labor can hereafter be secured in making 
out the requisitioris for pay, especially if all the schools are taught and open so. 
near together that all can be drawn on a single requisition. 
County Superintendents’ Accounts. —These, if kept in the manner pre- 
scribed in the blanks furnished by this office, will show at any date, to the satisfac- 
tion of all interested, just the condition of the school moneys of the county. 
Some counties have not furnished their Superintendent the proper books for 
their accounts, This is a most serious fault, It is most embarrassing to the 
County Superintendent. He should not cease to apply for the books to the County 
Court till they are farnished, meantime keeping accurate accounts, at his own 
expense, fyr his own protection, and as necessary to the discharge of his duties 
correctly. 
Before the war the money was. disbursed to the counties, whether | there were 
schools. or not. That money was notoriously used for private purposes, 
Now the object of the law-——free schools, five mouths, for the children of the State 
--must be ‘assured before the money is disbursed to the counties; and no teacher 
' can be paid until the services have been rendered. 
This strict adherence tothe object in view is opposed by all the old ideas and 
habits in regard to all school ‘affairs. Before the war there was no exhibition in 
the State of the accountabilities of the respective officers. Now the system is 
transparent; the public are invited to see and scrutinize what ig done at every 
step. It is intended that any one in this office shall get a complete view of all 
school facts in the State; so with each county and district where. the work is done 
as required by the law and the instructions furnished. 
Accounts are kept here with each Civil District in the State. A separate ac. 
count with each sub-district would be out of the question with the lack of. clerical 
aid. The reports required here give:a full view of each man’s work, and furnish 
the ground for the assurance contained in the first Circular to Superintendents 
" from this office; “Communities need have no doubt that you and each Superintendent 
will be carefully held accountable for its impartial administration.”
-P-A-G-E-251
xXovV 
Lrepeat here, és in the Circular of June, 1868, “No Superintendent should al- 
low one cent of money entrusted to him to go out of his hands without.a legal 
youcher, for-he will be held to a strict accountability.” 
‘The extreme sensitiveness of the public mind upon the subject of the school 
fund, has seemed ‘to tempt designing men to start rumors and nurse false state- 
ments into éxistenoe for the purpose of personal ends, or for the injury of the free 
school'sysiem. “As regards this office, no opportunity is given for a possible pre- 
text for any of those charges to be true, by never taking ‘into it a cent of the mo- 
ney going to the counties; and no watchfulness is spared to see that every dollar 
sent to,the counties secures its results, The response to this purpose, on the part 
‘of the County Superintendents, has been gratifying. Many charges have been 
made against their faithfulness. : 
So far, after the'closest examination into all cases of accusation, whatever the 
difficulties ‘or misfortunes of the County Superintendent, I-have found every dol- 
Jak reaching ite legal destination. 
There is abroad a féeling that public moneys can be used for the private bene- 
fit of public officers. 
Sometimes their bondsmen are said to demand unlawful advantages, 
No school officer should listen for a moment to these temptations, : 
Whatever others may do, let him be careful that never a dollar of money due 
the district passes out of his hands without the proper legal voucher. 
The school system should s set an example of the intelligence and virtue ‘that it 
would inculcate,” 
The fear exists that the State wilt not meet its obligations to the schools. 
It is specially sought to spread the belief that this office is Taithlesa in refer- 
ence to the school fund. 
A-look at the facts will satisfy all fair minds, First—observe the method 
adopted—mientioned. above—by which not a dollar of the permanent fund, or of 
the fund for distribution, comes into this office, Second—the ‘direct and well- 
known efforts made by the State Superintendent to secure a most faithful dis- 
charge of all school obligations, urging the settlement of the deranged and lost 
fund, paying the interest due, and collecting the fragments scattered in the vari- 
ous counties, and the return of all school moneys to the use for which they were 
raised. The dejays and embarrassments in the prompt payment of obligations to 
the schools, 1 have keenly appreciated, as well as the struggles of the State to 
maintain her integrity and meet all classes of obligatious; and while intending to 
criminate neither on one hand nor on the other, I have endeavored not to fail to 
do my whole duty in seouring for the schools their dues. I said, January 26th, 
1869, in answer to inquiries by » Joint Committee of the Legislature, “The law 
says such a tax shall be levied on polls and property, and whatever that produces, 
shall be divided equally among’ tha children of the State; and paid, when districts 
comply with the law, The amount to be distributed, and the number of children 
among whom it is bestowed, must, therefore, be known before what each will ree 
ceive can be told, 
“This requires delay until the taxes are collected, before it can be said what 
any district is to receive; and consequently before it can be calculated what to 
raise by local tax. The estimate for the entire State, would require an estimate 
from each district of what it proposed to expend. 
“ Just now nothing can relieve the anxiety and distress arising from the present de- 
lay and uncertainty, but an immediate apportionment of the moneys due for distribution
-P-A-G-E-252
Xcvi 
From the interest accrued and tax collected up to and including January 1st, 186 
This done, untold obstacles would pass away, and under the method of business| 
adopted by this office, the Treasury 3 need fear no special embarrassment; for though 
the amount due should bea million of dollars, so far from being all drawn out at 
once, it would be called for only in small amounts, month after month, till the 
close of the fiscal year, September 30th, 1869; and, indeed, perhaps not all of it 
would be demanded even then; for any place, which does not comply with the 
law, will secure no money. 
“Tn order to avoid this uncertainty,and its evils, for the future, I have taken 
_ the liberty to suggest, that such changes should be made as will require the scho~ 
lastic census to be taken in March, and reported here, to correspond wich the re- 
port of the tax duplicates from the different counties to the office of the Comptrol 
ler, and that, after deducting from the total of the school tax, so reported, such a 
per centage as has been found to be the average annual deficit, an apportionment 
of the balance shall be made among the scholastic population, and aunounced by 
July ist, of each year; thus enabling each. district to know at the outset what it 
can expect to receive from the State on compliance with the law.” 
Third—Observe what has been accomplished. When this office was opened in 
October, 1867, free schools, like negro enfranchisement, were extremely odious. 
There was no school money in the Treasury, and there was a wide-spread, almost 
unanimous, belief, that there would be none. “Sham,” “humbug,” were slurring 
terms used to designate the system, Without District Directors, without County 
Superintendents, as a general thing without school-houses and without teachers, 
and the idea prevailing that free schools meant only inferior schools for paupers; 
no money to pay the slightest expense for this office, or the County Superintend- 
ents; no money reported to the office for schools till August 3rd, 1868, ten months 
after it was opened: now houses have been built and repaired, teachers have been 
found, excellent men have filled the places of Directors and Superintendents, and 
in spite of all conceivable opposition, schools, white and colored, have sprung up 
all over the State. Almost every county reports them in progress. Many counties 
have had as many schools as the law requires, and every county gives assurance 
that free, schools will open before September closes. 
The quality of the schools, though not so good as we seck, bas nevertheless been 
such as widely to relieve them of the false charge of being pauper schools, and 
secured for them, in not a few instances, the reputation of being the best in the 
county, 
Teachers, though the State, heavily pressed with indebtedness, could not always 
promptly pay their claims, have patiently pursued their daily toil, held conven- 
tions, and advanced-their qualifications, and at last found their work rewarded 
quite as surely as when dependent upon tuition fees. Overcoming all obstacles, 
the inauguration of the system has so far advanced, that, though the first money 
was-reported to it by the Comptroller August 8rd, 1868, for apportionment, there 
had been approved $456,142.80 up to May 22nd, 1869, when the total requisitions 
for school money in this office were last summed up. 
This does not indeed indicate the progress we have sought. Jt does not show 
that the Treasury of the State has met all its obligations to the schools; but it is 
very different from nothing, or very different from a failure to do anything. Com- 
pared with what the State ever did before, it is remarkable. In the two years 
Preceding the war, the total amount disbursed by the State under the old system 
was, 1859, $220,872.75; 1860, $237,091.20—being a total of $457,963.95, or only
-P-A-G-E-253
XOVIL 
about a thousand more than the $456,142.80 drawn upon the Treasury and cashed 
generally between August 3d, 1868, and May 22d, 1869, a period considerably leds 
than one year. In estimating the effort it has cost to do this, it should not be forgot- 
ten that the work was largely done before this money was ready, and done against 
a wide-spread belief that there would be no money forthcoming when services 
were rendered. A no less satisfactory result is obtained, when we compare what 
“has been done in Tennessee with what has been accomplished by any of the free. 
school systems going into operation in any 0 of the States wrecked in the rebellion, 
and recently re-organized. 
Familiarity everywhere with the statistics and accounts of the County Superin- 
tendents, will leave no room for honest doubt of the work done or the efficiency of - 
the system. : 
The warrants of the Comptroller, now in the hands of County Superintendents, 
it is hoped cnn be paid by the collectors of revenue in the counties. 
Over their payment, this office has no control. Superintendents holding them 
should correspond with the Comptroller or the Treasurer in regard to them. 
‘Opening Schools.—There. is much inquiry about the beginning of the school 
year. This is not fixed in the law. The industries of the State differ so widely in ” 
the period of greatest or least occupation, that the date when the greatest number 
can most conveniently attend school differs greatly in the different sections of the 
State. Perhaps as far as facts indicate a conclusion at present, July Ist may be 
said to be as convenient to all ae any date for the commencement of the school year. 
Each section or locality should open its schools when its industries will be best 
accommodated. They should open generally between the middle of June and the 
last of September. 
All districts.that so far have not had the schools to entitle them to draw on the 
apportionment of $1.15, made February last, can secure that apportionment, by 
opening schools before the close of September next. 
Districts which have had their schools, and drawn that apportionment, can open 
their next term of schools, expecting to draw from the State whatever the appor- 
tionment may be from the taxes of 1868, which should at least equal the $1.15 of 
1867, The tax of 1869 is now being collected. Should the suggestion which I 
have urged be carried out, that tax also would be available at the close of the next 
term of five months. 1 cannot ‘understand why the State should not as promptly 
pay out the revenue collected for schools, when the services contemplated have 
been rendered, as it does revenue collected for any other purpose. The taxes are 
now coming in. The general revenue thus coming in can be drawn on at once by 
any bill that comes due, but the schoo] money that comes in at the same t me re 
mains unavailable for school purposes & year, ag the tax for 1868, though general- 
ly collected last December, is still unreported for apportionment, and so cannot be 
drawn by any bills in this office; and the amount cannot be reported, because it is 
not known what it will be till the settlement with tax collectors for that year has 
been effected. School officers cannot too clearly understand or state this fact. Its 
removal is essential, and will carry with it an untold host of difficulties in the 
way of free schools, for which school officers have no more responsibility than any 
other citizen. : 
Tt is easy to see what an impetus ready money in the Treasury for school pur- 
poses would give the school work, 
But what has been accomplished is the best assurance that more will be accom~ 
plished in the future, Let every officer, teacher and district, go forward in opeving

schools, with assured confidence in the State's meeting its obligations. Do not de- 
stroy what has been the means of securing so much, hecause it ha: not done impus- 
sibilities, and brought out of the Treasury all the money collected for school pur- 
poses, but sustain the school system ;. press its efficiency to the highest point. The 
State’s financial embarrassment will pass away ; or if’ it does not, the education of 
the young will be seen and felt'to be so fundamental and so much before ull other 
interests, that nothing caa delay the most exact fulfillment of all obligations to 
schools. . . 
Cheaper to Educate than to Punish.—It is not surprising that thoughtful 
and disinterested persons, observing the Siate, county and city expenditures for 
crime, and the reluctance with whicn school expenditures are made, are struck with 
the fact of 80 many and various assaults upon the school system, when the expendi- 
tures and losses by crime go almost unnoticed ; whereas elsewhere there is a constant 
comparison between the cost of education and the cost of crime, showing how 
much better it is to educate, and thus prevent crime, than to permit crime in its 
untold forms agvinst person and property, and in addition to all the losses occa- 
sioned by it, be compelled to bear an expense in punishing it greater than the cost 
of reducing or preventing it by educution. 
Clositg the last fiscal year, the Comptroller is compelled to report the expendi- 
ture of $534,457.92 in the payment of various expenses required for the suppres- 
sion of disorder or the punishment of erime. 
Here are $78,309.12 more than the sum given above, as approved for school pur- 
poses, since the opening of this office to the 22d of May. Who has called it in 
question, or has sought to apply a remedy? When after twenty months of hardest 
service for the prevention of these expenses for crime, by the establishment of free 
schools, the total amount paid to eighty-four County Superintendents was $14,480, 
what wisdom was displayed in efforts to abolish supervision altogether! What a 
folly and expense it was here and there pronounced!! Did any one call attention 
to the amount it cost to transport criminals to Nashville? Did any one object to 
the bill of $14,433 08 in a single year for that purpose, and show his wisdom’ by 
calling for the abolition of the transportation of criminals to the penitentiary at 
Nashville? . 
In estimating this cost of crime, it must be remembered the State bears only one 
part of it—that each county and city has, besides, its fees, and constables, and po- 
lice, and jails. Then comes in the property stolen by thieves and robbers, and 
destroyed by incendiary fires. Can any one tell it accurately? Reports of 
these items are coming to me. Here and there over the Slate have been great 
fires, destroying $50,000, or $75,0)0, or $100,000 worth of property, and caused 
by some ignorant person, whom the community never did anything to tench bet- 
ter. Do those who object in so many ways.to free schools, want these losses and 
taxes ? 
What is the interpretation of their objections? Are there men who prefer the 
progress of ignorance and crime to the advancement of knowledge and virtue? 
Are there parents who would willingly be taxed more to pay for punishing their 
sons as criminals, than to pay for their edugation? Are there parents who would 
have sons villains rather than honest men? Arethere citizens who would sooner have their property and lives expused to destruction by criminal sons of their neighbors, who grow up in ignorance, and in addition pay a heavy tax for their punishment, than pay a slight tax for their education in virtue? Chancellor Kent said, “A parent who sends his son into the world uneducated does a great injury
-P-A-G-E-255
Xcrx 
to mankind, as well as to his own family; for he defrauds the community of a 
useful citizen, and bequeaths to it a nuisance.” 
Every man who attacks or opposes a free school system, or throws discredit upon 
it, or strikes at its vital parts, or throws obstacles in the way of its officers, may 
well pause and inquire what answer to the above and similar questions, be thus 
giver. Daniel Webster declared, “ Among the planets in the sky of New England, 
the shining lights which throw jntelligence on her people, the first and most bril- 
liant is her system of free schools. I congratulate myself that my first speech on 
entering public life was in thejr behalf. If I.had as many sons as old Priam, I 
would send them, all to public schools. Education should ‘be universally diffused, 
That which is elsewhere left to chance or charity, we secure by law. For the pur- 
pose of public instruction, we hold every man subject to taxation in proportion to 
his property.’ We regard it as a wise and liberal system of police, by which prop- 
erty and life, and the peace of communities are recured.. By general instruction, 
we seek, ag far as possible, to purify the the whole moral atmosphere. We hope 
for security above the law in the prevalence of enlightened public sentiment. On 
the diffusion of education among the people rests the preservation of our free in- 
stitutions,” * 1 . 
Chancellor Kent again writes, “The mobs, the riots, the burnings, the lynchings 
perpetrated by the men of our day, are perpetra‘ed because of their vicious or de- 
fective education when children. We sce and feel the havoc and ravages of their 
tiger passions now, when they are full grown, but it was years ago when they 
were whelped and suckled.” 
Facts upon thig point may be found in every community + 
Cincinnati, 0., pays for schools $623,540.00—for police, $807,956.00. Chicago, 
IL, pays for schools $854,447.85—for police, $555,025.00. Memphis, Tenn., pays 
for schools $52,867.00—fur police, $147,702.17. 
Paying well for schools, we shull pay less for crime. 
County Eductional Meetings.—1 should have been pleased if, before.the- 
opening of the schouls this season, as I have written to some in answer to ingni- 
ries, the teachers in each county could have had some opportunity for specially ad- 
vancing their qualifications. Many, I have been happy to know, have been attend- 
ing school. Some schools, too, are giving special training in the theory and 
practice of teaching. But I would advise each county, 1f possible, to have.an ed- 
ucational méeting at which Superintendent, Directors, and all interested in advanc-. 
ing education may attend, but especially those who are to teach this session. The 
standard of examination was too low last year. It should be higher this year, aud. 
each year following; besides, many will begin their work as teachers, and all need 
such a meeting to prepare them for their duties in the school room. Most counties 
have gentlemen of attainments—clergymen, lawyers and docturs—who wauld 
gladly assist Superintendents and teachers in making such a meeting pleasant and. 
profitable. Let it continue one day at least, and several days if possible, 
It may be organized, if you picase, as a Teachers’ Institute, or Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation ; may elect a President and Vice-President, who shall introduce its exer~ 
cises, see that a carefully prepared programme is carried out, and preside over its 
deliberations; and may elect Secretaries, who shall keep an accurate record of its 
proceedings; and an Executive Committee, whose duty it shall be to furnish a care- 
fally prepared programme and daily exercises, to appoint a critic, who shall justly, 
criticise each exercise and show its defects, and ‘how it might be improved. Those 
who excel in particular departments or branches, should be called out upon these. 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
” c 
topics. Let the educational thought and. experience of the county have expression 
Exercises should be short, embracing essays, lectures, discussions, criticisms, mu- 
sic, and business. The best methods of conducting the entire routine of school 
work should be fully brought out; best methods of organizing and classifying 
a school; of opening and closing; of securing quiet. and order, of increasing 
attendance, and rendering it regular and punctual; of managing questions of 
discipline ; of conducting recitations in al] the varions branches taught; of se- 
curing the interest of parents in the school; of keeping the registers; of keep- 
ing the grounds, house and room, in good condition ; of improving the manners 
and morals of pupils. Especially should teachers be impressed with the high 
aim and momentous consequences of their work. They should; by means of 
catching inspiration these meetings be more and more imbued with the true 
spirit of teaching, from the great modelsin their profession, Their contract to 
teach so many days should mean to them not sponding so miny days in the 
school-room, or indifferently going through with a prescribed routine, and re- 
ceiving so many dollars aspay. ‘No art has so high a mission as this work upon 
the human soul, They should tremble and beware “to lay rude hands upon God's 
mysteries there.” They should strive that there be nothing in their principles, 
characters, habits, scholarship, methods, manners, speech, conduct, pronunciation 
—in.a word, nothing in themselves they would not sce reproduced in the lives and 
conduct of their pupils. After the schools have opened, these meetings should be 
kept up regularly. The teachers’ library should be brought into constant use. 
Every teacher will do well'to take an educational journal, Says an eminent edu- 
cator, “No person shoujd assume the employment of teaching who does not pos- 
sess enough of profes@pnal interest to cause him to aid in the support of a pericd- 
ical devoted to the greut interests of his profession.” + 
School Registers.—Every school should have a copy. of thé school register. 
Superintendents should be prepared to furnish from their office, paid for by the 
county, a register to each teacher, before the school opens, which at the close of the 
school the teacher shall return to the Superintendent, to become a part of the 
records of his office. Without the register I can wnderstand how teachers, when 
called upon for reports, know so little about their schools, 
No merchant will trust his business to scraps of paper or to memory. A teacher 
is dealing with, golden moments of time in the life of every pupil, and with the 
thoughts and purposes'which are to make up his life and character that cannot die. 
He can bring neither to his own mind,.nor to the mind of his pupil, or to those 
of his friends, or of the community, @ proper appreciation of the value of the 
pupil's making: the most of every moment, and of doing well every required duty, 
without a record of attendance and of what he has done, as the register provides. 
This record is the special aid in furnishing the parent a correct ides of what the 
- child does. It works against absence and tardiness, and all disinclination to duty, 
and has a tendency to inspire teacher, pupil, parent, and community with greater 
efforts for the suecess of the school. Superintendents should examine registers 
carefully when visiting the schools, and see that they are well and neatly kept. 
The attention of parents and other visitors should be frequently called to them. 
Correct Knowledge of the System.—tThe registers are the source of all 
the information of that class of reports which show what schools have accom- 
plished. 
The registers well kept, the teacher's report is only a summary of what the reg- 
ister and the class-books contain; and all the reports of statistics beyond to the last
-P-A-G-E-257
rere cr 
Teqiared are only copies and consolidations of these. They all tally each with 
the other, and render the system visible in all its parts, easy to be understood by 
any one who wishes to take the trouble to see it as it is, The schools are for the 
public good. The law claims to be framed solely with that view. For this pur- 
pose it gives and restricts powers. It is believed that all it requires of each afficer 
should be fully exposed to the examination of all interested. If it is right, should 
it at first cross prejudices, or interests, or favorite notions, it will secure the ap- 
proval of right reason, and finally win general approval, and succeed. If the 
system is not right, it ought uot to prevail. Wisdom has always -a final majority, 
Whatever the system is, it is of and for the people, and they should know it fully. 
Ithas never failed where tried. It is not likely to fail’ here, Every school officer 
should try to convey to atl around him a correct idea of wkata free school system is. 
This done, a conviction cannot fail to follow, that such a system furnishes the best 
means for public instruction the world has ever yet devised; that no one’s real 
interest is subserved by opposing it; that all will be benefited by its speedy in- 
troduction and complete organization and execation. 
What I see assailed, in much that is said and written against as bad in our 
system of schools, or as done by our school officers, is neither the school system in 
Tennessee, or anywhere else, and was never done by the school officers of the State. 
Let all you devise aud all you do for the schools of your county be known. If it 
is right, men of right minds will begin to approve, adopt and sustain it. If it is 
not right, we should be thankful for any aid in enabling us to see and prevent or 
correct the wrong. The purpose of the officers of the system should include noth- 
ing but what is included by the intentions of the law, and in those of the system of 
scbools it establishes. . 
Conscious of the integrity of their motives, and of the faithful discharge of their 
daties as required bag. its officers can afford, unmoved, to recvive the agsaults of 
those hostile to the é@ication of all the children of the people. For if they do 
their duty thus faithfully, the charge of their fraudulent or unfaithful conduct is 
not-only false, but can only have the effect to weaken or embarrass the schools, and 
_ Prevent their success; and when the full results are seen, it will be manifest that 
the hostility was not so much to the individuals administering the law, or to im- 
perfections in the law, as to the object of the law, and to the work it is doing in 
opening a path of light and virtue to every child in the State. Your work, well 
and faithfully done, you may leave all attacks upon it to those who advance in 
character and excellence through the schools you establish, 
Be sure that the system is honestly and competently administered. Every objec- 
tion then against its administration must mean, by necessity, one of two things— 
either that those who object and find fault want dishonest, incompetent and inefii- 
cient administration of school affairs, or no administration of them at all; that is, 
no free schools worthy of the name, but rather an unrestricted opportunity for 
popular ignorance und its ‘consequences. Set your faces resolutely against all 
efforts to defraud the State of an educational system, whether made against fands 
devoted to schools, or made to render it useless, by falsifying or misrepresenting 
the facts in regard to it, and so destroying public confidence in it. The system 
dep. nds upon funds and character for its success. Its enemies may attempt to 
steal either. An honest man will neither defraud it of its money or its good name. 
Every schovl officer, and teacher and citizen, as he understands and fulfills hig 
relations to the interests of the young as bound up in the’ free school system, will 
omit nothing in his power to do for the protection of either, as vital to the progress

of universal education. Iregret to say that I am sometimes astonish 
ments from school officers and intelligent citizens, indicating at once 
confidence in what they know about schools, and an equally surprisin 
of State School Systems in general, and of the Tennessee system in p: 
Because a man has een a free school syst: min a district, or village, or city o 
some other State, or read an article ora report upon it, he is. not therefore sure 
be fully informed as to what that system is. Besides, education is the most pro: 
gressive of all things in this most progressive country, in this most progressi 
age. It is central to all progress, and leads all: No successful school system i 
now whal, it was thirty, or twenty, or ten years ago. 
No school officer should attempt to introduce his defunct schemes of education, 
Don’t dress the system in the cast-off clothes of othersystems. Tennessee deserves 
the very best, the latest and most perfect product of the educational thought and 
experience of the world. | Her educatorsand schools should take front rank. The 
prevailing ideas of education should be corrected according to the best models. 
Her song and daughters are as deserving as others, and should not be put to dis- 
advantage with other youth whom they are toencounter in the pursuits of life, by 
a defective system of education, or a good system imperfectly understood or inter- 
preted, or badly administered. 
The system must begin where education now is, and take it, forwarded by the 
way most economical, as regards money’ and time, and mind and character, to its 
competition with the best system elsewhere. This can only be done by the best 
plans, operated by (he best methods. 
Free Circulating Libraries.—Early after entering upon the organization of 
the schools, my inquiries upon the subject were ahswered from all parts of the 
State, that there were no Free Circulating Libraries The;plans which I have 
suggested to many County Superintendents, { am happy @ know, are in some 
quarters progressing with fair progpects of success. If my labors allow, a circu- 
lar detailing the plan of planting'at least one such Library ina county will be 
given. But the correspondence on the subject, it is quite impossible for me to 
answer. . | 
Encourage Every Youth.—Inquiries and solicitations, brought to me in 
person and by letter, indicate that there are many young persons in our State, of 
special promise, fighting and struggling for an education, for an opportunity to do 
something for their own improvement, for the betterment of mankind, who have 
neither access to schools or libraries. and have no parental aid and no symputhy 
from the communities around, but who, with a little intelligent and kindly co-opera- 
tion, would distinguish themselves in the different walks of life. School officers 
should be quick to discern these young persons, and say the fit word to them, and 
co-operate to give them the direction and aid they need. The eminent persons of 
the future are boys and girls now, and they, according to the analogies of the past 
are largely to cowe from thisclass of youth struggling for knowledge and virtue 
ander difficulties. To a benevolent mind, and to the statesman who would render 
productive of worth and virtue all the mental resources of the State, a pleasing 
feature of a free school system is the fact that it opens the door of knowledge to 
every child, however humble his parentage, and invites him to come up to the 
highest attainments in physical, mental and moral power. It proposes to do what 
it ca to leave none to ignorance, or to idleness, or to vice, or to crime, but to 
arouse all to do no harm to others in person or estate, and to inspire each to be 
the most, and do the most in his power for the good of all the interests, individual 
and associated, which the public welfare includes.

If a man who makes two blades of grasa grow where but one grew before, is a 
benefactor of mankind, how much more is he who is the means of inspiring a 
human soul to a higher destiny—to increase the good of his life two and three fuld 
—~or who starts a Rhea, or a Fulton, or.an Edwards, or a Washington, on his career ? 
What, too, may the influence of one such youth be on his immediate associates ? 
A free school system should everywhere be alive with the spirit and instrumen- 
jalities which arouse and aid for good the force latent in the youth of the State. 
Indeed, every man who has had an opportunity for progress himself, should feel 
that that opportunity places him under special obligations to aid every other man 
or youth who seeks to advance in knowledge and improve in character. Especially 
is one bearing @ part in an educational system bound. to do this. Minds, like 
plants, are searching around seeking light. We cannot tell by the home whence 
they came, or the name they bear, or the clothes they wear, the size or character of 
their soul. 
Besides, the child that schools do not invite, the prison or halter is more likely to 
catch, 
Let there be light for all!

The Permanent’ School Fund—Extracts from Reports of Committees, 
  
The Committee on Education and Common Schools, in obedience to Senate Resointion No. —, having examined and ascertained the amount of school fund which constituted a part of the capital stock of the Bank of Tennessee, report as the result of their labors, the following statement of facts : 
From the books of the Bank of Tennessee, it appears that the capital stock of said bank was adjusted on the 1st of January, 1859, and the achool fund constituting a portion of the capital 
   
      stock.of said bank, was as follows : . 
School fund.. $ 215,647.35 Scloot fund “Ocoee 576,536.81 school fund, U.8. public Jands.. 11,189.80 Garplas revenue, (one-haif 466,439.59 ger balance...... 44,621.18 
$1,414, 484.73 Total, es tenose snseseceen: esevaseaseneetes . 
It will appear from the foregoing statement thatthe amount due from the State of Tennessee 
to the school fund amounts to the sum of $1,316,434.73. . 
The foregoing sum includes the amount received from the Bank of Tennessee, in specie, 
which, by order of the Legislature, was converted into United States seven-thirties, and which 
subsequently passed into the hands of the Tennessee National Bank at Memphis, and amount- 
ing in seven-thirties to over $600,000. 
Your committee do not see the necessity or propriety of issuing ordinary coupon bonds for 
the school fund orany part thereof, as the same might be stolen, misappropriated, or other- 
wise disposed of, and have instructed me to recommend that the Governor issue one bond to 
be lodged with the Comptroller, acknowledging the indebtedness of the State to the school 
fund to be one million three hundred and fifteen thousand and four hundred and thitiy-four 
and seventy-three one-hundredth dollars (1,315,434.73,) with interest, payable annually, and that 
said bond on its face be noi transferable, 5 
All of which is respectfully submitted.

Address to the People of Tennessee on Popular Education, 
Submitted to the State Teachers’ Association, at Nashville, October 12th, 1869, by J. B. 
Linpsury, R. P. Weuts, 8. R. Ropanes, Committee, and adopted by the Conven- 
tion. ‘ 
This able, well-timed Address, prepared by Rev. J. B Lindsley, D-D., LL.D., 
Chancellor of the University of Nashville, an earnest and constant friend of the 
system of free universal education in Tennessee. Iinsert not.only for its in- 
trinsict merit, but as essential to # correct ides of the opinions and efforts which 
led to the establishment of this system in the State. 
The distinction and glory of man is intellect. But intellect uncultivated and 
undeveloped is as though it were not—emphatically a blank. Individual men 
rank by their intellectual culture and growth, and so nations and communities. 
France stands foremost among the uations of the earth, not because of her admir- 
able geographical position, or her enormous military strength, but because of the 
acuteness of mind and brilliancy of genius belonging to her inhabitants, and be- 
cause of the fertility of ideas consequent upon the high cultivation of mind so 
long prevalent in her midst. Russia, with a continental territory and a vast pop- 
ulation, is only beginning to be a power among the nations, because but recently 
entéred upon a career of intelectual culture. Just as she has advanced in this 
career so has her influence and power advanced. and her rank among the nations 
of Christendom. Not territory, not population—mind makes a State. 
Tennessee, one of a large community of States, constituting in the aggregate 
continental, imperial republic, must hold rank in this great sisterhood of States, 
not because her position geographically and climatically is pre-eminently favor- 
“able, and her industrial resources of peculiarly rich and varied character, but 
mainly because inhabited by a people who possess the highest culture of the age, 
and are thus justly entitled to take » high stand among contemporaries. In the 
past periods of the brief history of our State her position has been high, because 
of the great influence exercised by her people on the affairs of government. 
Hereafter this high relative standing cannot be retained unless by a more extended 
culture and exercise of mind. Every Tennessean must, if not altogether devoid 
of patriotic instincts, be deeply solicitious that his native or adopted State should 
thus retain its high renown in the great commonwealth, so that always hereafter 
as heretofure, her children may with honest pride and fond affection, pronounce 
her musical and venerated name. 
In the new career upon which we in common with so many of our sister States 
are now entering, much, if not all, depends upon the manner in which we make 
our s'art as @ State. Our people cannot too often reflect that their prosperity 
and welfare depend maivly upon the action of their own General Assembly, for 
which they, the people, are solely responsible. The United States of America 
may be admirably well governed, and so may the large State of California and 
Tinois, or the small ones of Massachusetis and West Virginia; while Tennessee, , 
through unwise or in defect of wise legislation, may languish in poverty and igno- 
Tance a scorn and contempt and proverb among the citizens of her wiser and hap-
-P-A-G-E-263
cevit 
pier compeers. The principal hopes of government—the ones most vital to the 
daily well-being of the citizen, by the American system of government, fa'l with- 
in the province of each individual State Legislature. In States where these 
bodies are wise, liberal, enlightened, the private citizen being sust:ined in all 
honest and useful enterprises, is encouraged to the utmost and to long-continued 
effort, and hence the State makes rapid and secure advances in prosperity and 
power. Where the contrary spirit prevails nothing remains for enterprising, 
active men but to leave the unfortunate, misguided State; or else, which is the 
true, patriotic course, earnestly to fight against bad legislation, and by patiently 
enlightening their fellow-citizens to work a reformation and relieve the country 
of 4 curse. 
Among the subjects on which the individual State has virtually unlimited and 
supreme control, there is one so vital to the welfare of the community, and so 
wide-reaching i in all its relations and effects, that had the Legislature no other 
function than the direction of this one element of civilization it would be still an 
assembly of supreme importance to Tennessee. This subject is education, which 
by the American Constitution is left entirely to‘State control. the National Gov- 
ernment having no function in this respect other than the expression of good 
will by donations more or less extensive to the separate States, which to the - 
dasting honor of the American Government have been bestowed with unstinted 
hands, 
It has so happened, that while prudence and liberality have characterized the 
past legislation of Tennessee on several points of great public moment, her rec- 
ord in this respect is one of reproach and regret from the beginning to the end- 
ing. Going back to the early acts of her General Assembly, we 6nd that higher 
oruniversity education was deprived by repeated legistation—ail the while pro- 
tested’ against—of the just and handsome provision made for it by the parent, 
State—North Carotina—and by the National Congress. And as popular educa- 
tion has ever been an outgrowth from the university, and never flourished with- 
out the university, it need not excite surprise that ever from that day to this, the 
hopes of the masses have been deceived by futile and nugatory legislation—that 
ambitious and selfish political leaders have ever promised the people a good sys- 
tem of pu'ilic schools and have ever falsified these promises, until at length Ten- 
nessee had fastened upon her magnificent and heaven-blessed domain the menn- 
est, poorest, most fruitless school system in America, ranking her among the 
very foremost States in the Union for deficiency in the elemental arts of reading 
and writing, 
In casting our thoughts back upon the history of the past two generations we 
cannot avoid, 
1, The pajaful reflection, however much of political and military renown and 
reputation the honored names of our illustrious public men have bestewed upon 
Tennessee, that yet these distinguished men of the past did signally fail of their 
obligations to the great masses of the people to whose aid and support they wero 
indebted for high office and distinction. Evident it now is, that they sought too 
much their own promotion and elevation, aud far too little that of the people. 
Let the public men of the coming period avoid ihe error, so that when their lives 
become historic their names may be recalled, not merely with pride, but with the 
warm affections of multitudes whose condition has beon made better by their 
well-timed exertions. The great truth ever stands, to-wit: That statesmanship is 
not the wielding the masses for self-aggrandizement—it is the devotion of self to
-P-A-G-E-264
CVIIT 
the welfare of the masses. The latter style of statesmanship alone, bestows un- 
dying glory. ’ 
While thus plainly adverting to the deficiencies of the past, we must not fail to 
do justice to the patience, zeal and devotion of the friends of university and aca- 
“ demic education, through whose persistent and ill-requited labors Tennessee has 
maintained a deserved reputation for knowledge and intellect. They have done 
whatever has been done, and far more than could have been anticipated, to re- 
deem the neglect and indifference of the State; and hereafter their names will 
become household words among an intelligent people, yet to oceupy the territory 
within the four lines bounding Teanessee. 
Thus, with regret and sadness recalling the past, we may be permitted earnestly 
to hope, that amid the storms and tempests of the past four years, the Tennessee 
system of public instruction has finally perished, never hereafter to be mentioned 
unless us a warning. . 
Now, that of necessity a new start must be made, let all Icvers of education, 
and all true-bearted Tennesseans call for no half-way measures. Profiting by 
the ripened experience of other communities, and looking at the peculiar condi- 
tion and wants of our own, let us put in operation a system of public education 
which shall liberally. endow the seats of higher learning and provide an efficient 
training for every child within Her borders. Nothing less than this is worth at- 
tempting, and unless this much is done, it is best to do nothing, Far better for 
the State to wait, and at length do something worthy her name and serviceable 
to the public, than to create again a miserable system vainly burdensome to the 
people and promotive of ignorance rather than knowledge. 
| As to universiry education, without ample provison for which Common Schools 
ave an impossibility, the readiest method would be to execute justice and. to wipe 
away a deep and enduring reproach from our annals, by carrying out the arrange- 
ments contemplated in the compacts entered into more than half a century siiice, 
for the endowment of a high seat of learning in either end of the State. The 
spirit of these compacts now being complied with, would yield so large a fund, 
that these institutions might safely be left to depend upon that private liberality 
and beneficence slways exhibited by the Anglo-Saxon in behalf of colleges and 
universities. Wealthy individuals and public-spirited cities and towns, influenced 
by religion, philanthropy, or honorable civie pride, will, beyond doubt, amply-sus- 
tain any institutions thus fairly set afloat. 
The great educational work of the State, since all experience teaches that the 
State alone is competent to it, and since it has never been accomplished except 
by the State, is the making provision for the education of the multitude; the 
putting into practice the idea that intelligence ‘and citizenship are inseparable, 
the seeing to it that no one shall grow up to maturity without having ac- 
quuired the two arts which open the doors to all knowledge—the art of reading 
letters and the art of making letters. , 
Great as is this work, there is no insurmountable obstacle in the way of its 
Perfect success. Tennessee can just as readily provide a thorough and efficient 
system of public instruction for all her inhabitants, as can her sister States of 
Maseachusetts and Michigan; or the European kingdoms of Saxony and: Prus- 
sia; or the motntain-bound republic of Switzerland. In the latter, a State sys- 
tem of instruction .went into operation so recently as 1838, the result of which is, that in a population of over two millions, hardly boy or girl can be found 
who cannot read and write. The same statement is made of Prussia, with its
-P-A-G-E-265
crx 
population of more than sixteen millions. Indeed, Northern and Western Ger- 
many, the land of great Universities and deep learning, is alxo, by all odds, the 
land of common schools nd universal intelligence. What a wonderful contrast 
to our own lovely State, where, in a population of rather more than eight hund- 
red thousand white people, there are, at this day, more than eighty thousand 
adults-who can neither read nor write. Surely our rulers have been sadly re- 
miss, and our people sadly asleep. Let us now awake; and although we may 
not expect in one or in ten years, to reach the educational position of the above- 
named communities, in which time and money have done so much 3 yet, certain- 
ly. like eminence will in due time be attained when once the State has, in earn- 
est, entered upon the same career by which this great work is to be carried on- 
ward to perfection are easily found and comprehended. There is no difficulty or 
mystery about the matter,. Our people must value the accomplishment of this 
end sufficientty to be willing to pay for it. Just as they would infinitely prefer 
high taxation to the shame and degradation of dishonored credit, so must they 
prefer high taxation to the shame and inferiority of popular ignorance. Just as 
they are willing to pay vast sums for the support of the various branches of the 
State government, and sums yet more vast to sustain the National goverument, 
so must they be willing to pay vast sums for the distinguished ‘privilege of Uni- 
versal Education. As the large amounts needed for governmental purposes are 
raised from year to year, by direct or indirect taxation, sv should it be with the 
public schools, The only school fund really worthy of the name is that annu- 
ally contributed by a willing people—taxes cheerfully voted and cheerfully 
paid, because the eminent benefit resulting from the expenditure of the money 
is apparent to all. 
In Tennessee, we have a scholastic population of something more than three 
hundred thousand children, to give each of whom the benefits of a thorough sys- 
tem of public instruction would require the expenditure of about a million per 
annum, . 
This may seenta very large amount to be raised from the people of Tenneseee, 
annually, for this purpose. But if we compare the expenditures of our people 
for railroads, and other purposes, or the amounts raised in other States for edu- 
cational purposes, it will not appear out of proportion, or beyond our ability. 
The State government of Tennessee, with the support of courts, county govern- 
ments, ete., ete. costs, annual’y, in the neighborhood of $800,000. The amount 
required to pay the interest upon the State debt, annually, is close upon $1,200,- 
000, and this is mainly for internal improvements. 
Massachusetts, with a population of 1,231,000, raised by taxes in 1862, for the 
support of public schools, $1,500,501; besides large sums for school buildings, 
ete. 
New York, in 1862, with a population of 8,880, 755, expended for school pur- 
poses, $4,468,741, 
Pennsylvania, in 1862, with a population of 2,900,115, expended on public 
schools, $2,559,415. x 
Ohio, with a population of 2,839,502, raised in 1868, by State tax for’ school 
purposes, $1,155,221; and by local taxation for school purposes, $1,021,012, mak- 
ing in all, $2,176,288, 
Michigan, with a population, of 749,118, expended in 1862, for teaching and 
for school buildings, $604,170. 
Illinois, with a population of 1,711,951, expended for school purposes, $2,007, 
312, in 1862.

Thus we could go on and make our enumeration tediously compl-te. Enough 
has been cited to show, that in, our sister Stutes.education is the principal cause 
for public expenditure; a fact wich has excited the admiration and applause of 
the greatest European philosophers, and is the most convincing proof of the 
truly democratic eharacter of thoge States. 
Heavy as would be the annual tax necessary to place Tennessee upon a level 
with the above-named States, we need not doubt its being cheerfally submitted 
.to by the people, since no money contributed from their purses to public objects 
so quickly and so visibly produces a welcome return, Indeed, in most other 
cases. the multitude do not perceive to what end their taxes are applied, or the 
benefit they each and all derive from the expenditure. The benefits of the ad- 
ministration of justice are needed, but exceptionully, the: momentous value of 
public credit requires reflection to be rightly appreciated; and thus it happen, 
that Universat Epvucation is the only. object of public expenditure which 
from its peculiar character, commends itself to the attention, the interest, and the 
good wishes of every child, woman and man in the community, When once its 
advantages are felt, never will they be foregone; and the last taxes of which a 
free people will complain will be those imposed for the education of their chil- 
dren, These are precisely the taxes of which the poor are most anxious to reap 
the benefit, and which the wealihy are most willing to contribute to the common 
good, 
In closing this brief address, we do earnestly ask our fellow-citizens to give 
this subject the full attention its importance demands; to sustain, by a hearty 
co-operation) all those public men who are active in promoting the cause of edu- 
cation; to aid all legislation in this behalf, by giving it a patient trial; and not 
to be satisfied with public men and with legislation, until Tennessee takes her 
rank among the foremost States for intelligence; until the gifts so profusely 
Javished upon her territory are worthily enjoyed by a gifted, intelligent, ener-

“More than 850 Students attended this School during the past year; about 50 of 
this number have been engaged in teaching in this and other States, during a part 
of the year, at salaries ranging from $25 to $50 per month. The prospects for at- 
tendance the ensuing year are still more encouraging. 
Boarding accommodations for at least 100 students have been provided in the 
« Home,” where the very ‘best facilities are afforded for the promotion of nentness, 
comfort, and healthy progress in all, that pertains to the education of body, soul 
and intellect. 
A competent Teacher of Musie has been secured, who will be present at the open- 
ing of the term, and give special attention to this'branch of education. 
A Commercial Department is organized, in which spe¢ial attention will be given 
to Penmanship, Book-keeping, and the ordinary forms of business. Young men 
and women, not members of the School, ean n by special arrangement, be admitted 
to this department, 
The Collegiate Department, in which classes. have already been formed, will be

East Tennessee UNIVERSITY 
Histsry—North Carolina, in ceding Tennessee to the United States, set apart 
100,000 acres of land for the maintenance of two colleges. This grant was con- 
firmed by Congress, in 1806. One of the institutions te be supporced by it, was 
chartered in{J807,:as “East Tennessee College” The endowment, however, was 
realized only in part, The Legislature of 1839 and 1840, created the College into 
a University.” With various changes and intervals of suspension, it continued in 
operation until 1862, when it was suspended by the war, In January, 1869, it was 
endowed with the College fund, derived from the United States, by Act of Congress, 
passed July 2d, 1862. The Trustees gave their consent to this change, and have 
taken steps to inaugurate the Industrial College as soon as possible. About $160,- 
000 of the proceeds of the sale of land scrip, have been invested by the Governor, 
8a
-P-A-G-E-270
CXIV 
Comptroller and Secretary of State in 6 per cent. Tennessee State bunds, for the 
use and benefit of the new institution. The remainder of the scrip will yield, as is 
supposed, over $100,000, and will also be-invested, by law, in similar bonds. The 
annual income of the College from this source is expected to be about $24,000, if 
the State punctually and faithfully pays the semi-annual interest upon its own 
bonds, held by the University. Inasmuch as the State has chosen to place the 
fund from the United States, given for this. purpose in these securities, the Trustees 
rely upon the State meeting its obligations to them, and have therefore proceeded 
to organize the Industrial College, with its farm, its sufficient buildings, its enlarged 
corps of Instructors and its several courses of study. 
“Aims of the Institution.—The Trustees are of the opinion, that the new Col- 
lege may, according to the terms of the United States Law, “be laid upon a broad 
foundation, as regards its work of instruction, and may embrace a wide range of 
studies.” Whatever it is, its leading,object must be to teach branches of learning 
pertaining to Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, But while doing that, it may, 
according to the evident intent of the donor of the endowment, be made to do 
moré. The words ofthe Act of Congress are, “not.excluding other scientific and 
classical studies.” The-Trustees, therefore are at liberty to provide in the proposed 
institution for the instruction of the students in all departments of Collegiate 
knowledge. The means at command may not allow of this being done, or the 
wants of the youth of the country may not require it.. But there is no legal re- 
striction to prevent it. The Trustees can act upon their discretion in selecting 
branches of learning, outside of those relating to agriculture and the mechanic 
arts, to be taught in the College. of 
The chief object of the endowment in this case is obvious. By the wise liveral- 
ity of individuals and States, large provision had already been made in the United 
States for the thorough education of youth in the Classics and in some of the 
Sciences, and students in the principal Colleges, (generally the sons of people of 
weulth or culture or of both,) have found in them the means of preparation for 
study of one or other of the learned professions, to the practice of which they have 
afterwards devoted themselves. It was therefore, the mind of the authors of this 
endowment, that the higher education of the industrial classes should have gener- 
ous aid from the Federal Government, It was designed, not to detract from the 
value of the professions of Law, Medicine and Theology, or to disparage,the usual 
College” cur calum, however largely it may consist of the Latin and Greek langua- 
ges and cf .lathematics, but that “agriculture and thé mechanic arts” should be 
brought from the back-ground, and have imparted to them those attractions which 
science and mental culture are capable of investing them with, to the view of edu- 
cated men; and that labor in the field or shop, shall no longer to such men appear 
in the light of relative disesteem, but be placed on a level with other work. It 
designed that the labor spoken of should not be left to be performed as a drudgery 
by those who, however worthy otherwise, have had few opportunities of education, 
or even of learning all that is interesting and valuable, and that may be learned, 
concerning their own busingss; but that the generations to come shall see the 
great body of the farmers and mechanics instructed in scientific knowledge, im- 
bued with a love of literature, and informed upon all subjects familiar to men of 
mental cultyre, equally with the great body of the Lawyers, Doctors, Clergymen 
and Merchants of the land. Itis as if a rich man, whose few older sons had been 
supplied with the means of commencing business and making a living, each for 
himeelf, seeing that they all have a fair share of success in the world, should re-
-P-A-G-E-271
cxv 
solve to take his many younger sons by the hand and. give them severally a good 
startin life. This illustration is imperfect, in that the doors of the new College 
will be open to youth, not only from the industrial classes or who intend to follow 
industrial pursuits, but from all classes, and whose purpose it is to make an honest, 
useful and lawful work their business in life. Allthat has just been said, however, 
‘will serve to indicate what was the aim and purpose of the United States in mak- 
ing the endowment, with which the Trustees of East Tennessee University have 
been put in trust. . 
Preparatory Schools.—The Trustees of the University have thought it advisable 
to put the requircments for admission to the College as low as possible, and for the 
time, to furnish the necessary preparation to boys who give satisfactory evidence 
” that within two years they will be ready to enter upon the College Course 
In accordance with the preceding remarks, the Preparatory Course will be made 
as short as possible, and will be discontinued as soon as the necessity for it ceases. 
It has already been stated that the endowment in this case is strictly for College 
purposes. For that reason the Trustees do not feel authorized to maintain a Pre- 
paratory Department that is not nearly or quite self-supporting. No student will, 
therefore, be admitted to it free of tuition. . 
It is arranged that there shall be two Preparatory Schools, one for scholars who 
intend to pursue a classical course, and the other for those who wish to take an 
Agricultural or Scientific course. Each of these schools will have a very compe- 
tent Principal and Assistant. Pupils in them will be thoroughly instructed in 
Reading, Spelling, Penmanship, Rudiments of Drawihg, Arithmetic, Algebra, (in 
part,) Geography and English Grammar. Two grades will be established in each 
school, and each grade will be provided with a separate school-room and teacher. 
Tuition and incidental expenses will be $17.50. per term of five months for the 
bigher grade, and $15.00 for the lower one, 
Applicants for admission must be thirteen years of age; and be able to spell and 
read well; must understand Common School Arithmetic through Fractions, and 
have such maturity of mind and such ‘knowledge of Penmanship, Geography, Eng- 
Jish Grammar and Mental Arithmetic, as will enable them to enter College, after 
not more than two years further instruction. , 
Hilitary.—The law requires that instruction be given in Military Tactics to the 
students. Attendance upon military exercises will be made obligatory upon every 
able bodied student, with power vested in the President and Faculty, to grant 
special exemptions therefrom, for adequate reasons, The Military Professor will 
be charged with all the details of his department, subject to the paramount author- 
ity of the President and the established code of the University. The course of in- 
struction in Military Science, will require from: those who pursue it, attendance 
upon a recitation lecture of one hour’s duration or three days of the week durin 
the last Academic year. Military exercises will be so ordered as to subserve all 
the ends of a complete system of physical culture. A uniform of cadet ‘eloth will 
be required and may be obtained here at wholesale prices. 
Labor Corps.—All able bodied students will be required to perform a small 
amount of manual labor, and whenever possible, in the way of scientific experi- 
ment. Remunerative employment will te furnished when practicable. By the 
establishment of the rule that no student shall be exempt altogether from manual 
labor, or from military exercise, and that a military uniform shall be worn by all, 
the feeling of caste, it is believed, will be prevented. . 
Other courses of study than those already stated will be provided for in the Junior
-P-A-G-E-272
OXVI 
and Senior years for students who wish that their Collegiate education shall re- 
ceive a more special direction, as Civil Engineering, or Mining and Metallurgy. 
For the present, such provision does not seem to be necessary. The Trustees will 
endeavor, as the means of the University shall admit, to meet every obvious call for 
advanced means of instruction in particular branches of science and Christian 
education. . : 
Earnest students, who go to school to learn, are wanted at the University, and 
no others. This institution is not intended to be a reform school. Each applicant 
for admission must be provided with credentials from his last instructor, or from 
the institution with which he has been most recently connected. These must be 
presented to the President before the student can enter upon his examination. 
It is expected that non-resident students will have lodging in the College Dor- 
mitories, but only those whose deportment is in all respects quiet and orderly, will 
be allowed to do so. The Faculty elect are as follows: 
Rev. THOMAS W. HUMES, D. D., President and Professor Mental and Moral 
Philosophy.

Expenses. Each county of the State can send three students free of tuition, 
upon the nomination of the Representative of the county. Tuiticn to all others, 
$15 for five months. Room rent is $5 per year; incidental expenses, for janitor, fuel, 
&c., are $5 per year. Each student will be required to keep a depostt of $5 in the 
Treasurer's hand for a damage fund. Damages will be charged to those who cause 
them where they are known. In other cases they will be divided equally among 
all the students. Board may he obtained at prices ranging from $2.50 to $5.00 per 
week. The younger pupils in the preparatory schools should be provided with 
homes in families, The President will assist parents in selecting good places for 
their sons. To enable him to do this, citizens are requested to furnish the informa- 
tion whenever they can accommodate students.

Extracts from County Correspondence and Reports. , 
I.. EAST TENNESSEE 
Anderson County, January 5th, 1868—For want of school houses we were 
unable to open schools in all the civil districts in time to draw 48.07 cts. from the tax 
of 1866. If the State pays out the school money promptly, we need no longer con- 
sider free schools in Tennesese a failure. 
July 17th, 1869.—I find it impossible to obtain all the requirements of the pre- 
liminary report, on account of the Directors being either unwilling or unable to 
report anything but what is specifically required by law: 
September 30th, 1869.—I forward to you the preliminary report, very imperfect, 
indeed. The Directors and teachers must’ be educated to making such reports; at 
present they are strangers to the business. CHARLES D. McGUFFEY, 
County Superintendent. 
Blount County, January 1, 1869.—All the civil districts are able to draw the 
money of 1866, except two, and these would have been, but could not get teachers 
in time. Hope they will not lose it, The present school system is becoming very 
popular since we are able to pay some money to the teachers, Ihave no fears of 
its success if we are only able to meet our obligations. . 
August 24th, 1869.—I have forwarded all reports. The school system has given 
general satisfaction here. Tho grand drawback is the tardiness with which the 
State has disbursed the school money and the uncertainty of future disbursements.
-P-A-G-E-274

Schools are slow to report this Fall, as there is a general fear that the Legislature 
ill not allow the apportionment of 1868, T. J, LAMAR, 
“ee pe County Superintendent. 
Bledsoe County, October 27th, 1868,--I find a hostile element in this 
county much in the way of starting free schools. The objection urged is that 
we will never get anything for it. Ifthe State will only.do her duty and let us 
have the money, the objection will be groundess. I do hope this will be done. 
C. C, STRANAHAN, 
County Superintendent. 
Bradley County.—4. E. Blunt, A. B., the First Superintendent, in reporting 
the schools for the first five months, observes: , 
The many difficulties’ encountered in preparing to open. the schools were almost 
entirely overcome by the persevering efforts of the Directors. Too much credit 
cannot be given them for their untiring zeal and incessant labor amid thé great op- 
position and utter indifference to free schools. The principal difficulties met with 
were few and miserable school houses; the want of good, thorough teachers; the 
Tack of confidence in securing the school money; the little interest manifested in 
edneation by the parents, and the constant discouraging obstacles thrown in the 
way of teachers, 
In July nearly al) the schools were opened under the most favorable circum- 
stances as far as numbers were concerned, but unfavorable in all other respects 
above mentioned, Of the forty-five schools, all have been taught five mouths but 
six, which were suspended when within three or four weeks of their term on ac- 
count of insufficient houses, non-attendance and sickness. The town schools have 
been taught ten months, This non-attendance arid irregularity are certainly de- 
plorable. At their opening, nearly every school was crowded. Two or three 
months—and with many, only as many days and weeks satisfied most: children, so 
little do they love study and their parents appreciate education, small schools nec- 
essarily were found in most distriets—hardly large enoungh to pay a month's 
board, To remedy this evil the coming year it is proposed to divide the five months 
into two half sessions, one to be taught early in the summer, the other when it is 
most convenient for the farmérs to send all their children. It may be advisable to 
employ female teachers for the first half session, as almost all the scholars will be 
smali, and engage males to control the second half session. The Directors must 
decide by the wish of the majority of the patrons of each sub-district, when to 
commence, close, and which to employ, male or female. ‘ 
Of sixty-two applicants to teach, fifty-six passed an examination, securing a 
certificate. Fifty of these have taught ‘five. months, with three or four exceptions, 
in the county. According to @ decision of the Board of Education, the certificate 
qualifies teachers at the low rate of sixty per cent. Of these fifty six teachers 
eleven received a grade between sixty.and seventy per cent; thirteen between sev- 
enty and eighty ; twenty-one between eighty and ninety; and eleven over ninety 
per cent. 
Inasmuch as the school system looks to the advancement of the childre n, it is 
reasonable to expect the teachers will lose no opportunity in improving their 
chances to become*more proficient and perfect themselves in every possible way 
from year to year. The grade should be raised from one examination to another, 
in order to cut off all incompetent teachers, It is supposible that no perfect cor- 
tificate can be given or ought to be issued; consequently there is no limit to quali- 
fications; as the children advance and new methods of teaching are introduced, 
they demand a corresponding proficiency on the part of their instructors. Some 
who hold certificates cannot satisfy this demand the coming year, owing to a defi- 
ciency in Mental Arithmetic, Geography, Spelling, Writing and Theory of Teach- 
ing. Teachers are expected to keep themselves informed in all departments of the profession ; keep step with the best methods of teaching, and dispense with im- Proper pronunciation and ungrammatical expressions. Nothing is more painful than to witness the teaching of improper pronunciation, bad and imperfect expres- sions, to intelligent looking schools. Noisy, blustering, incompetent teachers are
-P-A-G-E-275
> CXIX 
,too numerous. Too many fail in discipline, in moral and Christian example, in 
quiet determination and honest faithfulness, Some still insist—in this enlightened 
age—on following a system of training too ancient for this generation. Everybody 
who expects to teach ought to avail himself or: herself of every chance to visit 
other teachers in their schools. This is the only way one can get a correct idea of 
good government and the best methods of imparting knowledge of the several 
branches to be taught in free schools. As much, perhaps more, sometimes, can be 
learned of the art in a badly governed school. Teachers must be qualified to teach 
any suthor—not only ‘the one ihey studied,” but all that any educated men, di- 
rectors, State authority deem expedient to put into the hands of a child. Men who 
teach for a “little money,” “to kill time,” “because they have nothing else to do,” 
ete., ought never to be employed. They are in no way fit for the echool room. The 
grounds taken by all experienced educators are, “that none should be allowed to 
teach who do not love the work, and none should be employed who have no taste or 
patience for teaching.” There are men and women’enough who will follow the 
profession if sufficient encouragement is offered. Better by far have a few good 
teachers than many poor, cheap and incompetent pedagogues. Those who like the 
business, and expect to spend at least three or four years in the school room; those 
who will make some effort to prepare themselves, studying the best methods and 
acquiring all possible information requisite to the position, should be the teachers 
of this county, and those alone should be employed by the Directors at good prices. 
Itis found by comparison that the younger teachers of this county are far ahead 
of their seniors in the most important duties of the school, One or two items may go to prove this and give a reason, Asa general thing the older teachers rely too 
much on a. reputation they have heretofore acquired jn some communities by a° 
show that can be gotten up at the close of a session, while the younger teachers 
work to acquire a name; to keep a place ameng real live teachers. Tie Directors 
should employ no one who is lazy in or outof theschoolroom. An indolent teacher 
will not do. He must be industrious, active, wide awake, working for each scholar 
as a lawyer works for his client—ever improving and approving every means that 
will spur the child onward. Merits, demerits, rewards, etc, are very good to stim- 
ulate the pupils if put into the hands of discreet teachers. They cannot be used 
by every one with beneficial results; rather evil comes from their use. Prizes are 
certainly out of place in every school room. They beget ill-will, prejudice and 
contention not only in school but in families of the district, The.most common 
and safest stimulus is that adopted by most all teachers, viz: that of taking places. 
No teacher in the exercise of his duties should strive to please every one. He can 
not do so, . Let him be a judge between right and wrong, justice aud injustice, and 
proceed to his duty regardless of any information he may obtain from this one or 
that, and place no child or parent one above another. All must be treated alike. 
Those that live in fine houses and fare sumptuously and such as are not able to 
furnish you a chair or an apple must be visited ani called upon an equal number of 
times. Every child must be noticed and occupy the same place in the eyes of all 
concerned. . 
A great lack of industry and faithfulness is apparent in our schools. Seven or 
eight hours’ teaching a day, by those who do not love the ‘business is merely © kill- 
ing time” for money—nothing more—while six hours’ wholesome training by real 
live teachers, who do more in two hours than the others do in days, advance chil- 
dren faster and much more to their satisfaction. The habit of allowing the larger 
scholars to whisper indiscriminately without leave and about everything but their 
lessons, disqualifies any one for this calling. Perfect order. with such seats and 
houses as are found in the county, is impossible—it is not expected. Whispering 
toeach other without permission, laughing, playing, running to the doer to see 
every passer by and such things, can be avoided. The idea of a teacher permitting 
the larger boys to sit outside, playing and looking through into the room to the an- 
noyance of everybody but a timid teacher () is utterly repugnant, and ought cer- 
tainly (o displace any one from so responsible a position, If the room is crowded 
- and it is inconvenient for all, it is well enongh to permit the larger boys to sit out- 
side, but never behind the house or against it, nor out of sight of the teacher. 
Each one should have a place, a seat assigned him and a little distance from the 
door or window, and the teacher should enforce order there as well as in the room, 
If a man or woman have not moral courage to declare that he or she is master— 
even to the largest—and is afraid to do right in refusing such things and worse,
-P-A-G-E-276

the school room is no place for them. As every act, word and even motion are 
carefully weighed by his pupils his example should be worthy of imitation. ‘Like 
teacher, like school.” Summing up‘all qualifications in a word, “common sense,” 
is the best, It teaches how to govern all—-the most ungovernable-—it enables one 
to assign proper lessons and have them recited correctly; it furnishes material—not 
rules—to keep every one busy and out of mischief; it controls noisy and talkative 
teachers; it subdues passionate and scolding dispositions ; it punishes wrong and 
rewards merit; it elevates virtue and degrades vice; and lastly, it makes all things 
in the school room harmonize to acquire the great end of improving the mind. 
It will be out of pluce in this report to advocate the employment of female 
teachers. The prejudice existing in most communities to this class of instruct- 
ors is as groundless as it is unjust. The apposition arises from not knowing 
anything of their qualifications, ability and fitness to train the little child. The 
éight lady teachers who have so honorably acquitted themselves in our School 
this year, have proved, beyond a doubt, their capacity to teach, govern and man- 
age the largest and most unruly. They are not only equal to male teachers in 
the exercise of the common duties of the school-room, but far better adapted to 
advance the the class of scholats now attending the free schools. In moxt cases, 
are found good qualities, good habits, strictly moral and christian traits, which 
are so essential to the moulding of the growing intellect. It may be saying too 
much, but experience proves that all schools of a primary grude are much more 
profitable when under the control of lady teachers. It is hoped that the directors 
will give this subject a careful consideration, and employ female teachers where 
the school will consist of small children. : 
The most discouraging hindrance to the progress of all schoclts—the greatest every teacher encounters—is the want of books, uniform text-books in the hands 
of his scholars. This want does not arise from incapacity, as a general thing, on 
the part of the parents. Some, it is true, are too poor to supply a large family 
of children with suitable books Too many think Webster’s spelling book. is enough fur any child, and all other branches are subordinate. Ifa trial were 
made—by those who-hold this opinion—on two classes, one having the speller 
and the other’a reader, experience would show at the end of five months, that 
the latter class would be two or three months in ddvance of the other. Every 
child should havea reader and speller; and if far enough along, an-arithmetic, 
geography, grammar, and writing books should be put into his hands. These six books would cost much less than three bushels of corn. What boy in the 
county; what girl that earnestly desires to learn; and what parent is there that loves his child, is not willing to work, raise or procure, three bushels of corn for their own intellectual good? Books are made to use, and not to be abused. 
The same six books will answer for a younger brother or sister, provided care be 
taken of them, . . . . 
The State Superintendent, at the request of a majority of the County Superin- 
tendents, recommended a list of text-books to be used in the Free Schools 
throughout the State. The objects to be attained by the uniformity of text-books 
in county and State are wholly and solely for the benefit of the parent and child. The teachers and book-stores derive nothing from such uniformity. The child with the same books as his class, will learn ninety per cent. more in a year than one would alone and with other books. Many other beneficial results eome from 
uniformity to both child and parent. In case the family move into another dis- trict, county, or part of the State. they have the.same books; they have ho new ones to"buy; no money to spend to gratify new teachers, and thus save not. only the book bill, but the learning the child has already obtained at home. 
This county was specially fortunate in having an excellent graded school 
opened in Cleveland, the principal town, through the zeal and efficiency of Rev. 
R. D, Black, . ., 
The old Academy was leased to the Trustees of Free Schools for the District, 
Mr. Blunt says: 
_ Rev. R. D. Black opened the school in January, 1868, under very unfavorable circumstances. The house was entirely too small, having no fences, no outhuild- ings, no black-boards, no partitions, and no doors that could be locked. Mr. B., with his usual energy, and the assistance of the directors, went to work fitting

up the houge, and supplying every convenience for the comfort of the pupils. 
Many trials have been made by different teachers in this house, and'as many 
fuilures, This is the only decided success the district has had for some years. 
Mr. B. deserves the highest credit for his efforts in this school.

Hox. Joun Eaton, JR., State Sup't Public Instruction: € 
Smm:--In compliance with your request, as to the success of the present system 
in my county, I would first state there is no failure in the system here. But we 
have had several difficulties in carrying out the law: Ist, in gotting competent 
men to serve as Directors. 2nd, in getting the County Courts to make appropria- 
tions for Registers, Blank Books and Stationery for District Clerks, ctc. Whatever 
like failares have occured in connection with the present system, in my opinion, 
Lave been owing to the failure in getting the sthool funds; which is not owing to a 
defect in the law, for that provides that the school funds shall not be paid out for 
any other purpose than education. I think Sub-District Directors ought’to be dis- 
pensed with. A Civil District Board of three is all that I think necessary. County 
Superintendents ought to be elected by the County Courts or the people. When 
. People fail to elect Directors, the County Superintendent should appoint without 
the approval of the State Superintendént. The law allowing County Superintend 
ents to regulate the time they occupy in their duties, at will, ought to be changed 
80 as to define their duties and their pay. The school funds collected in each county 
ought to be kept in the Gounty, and paid into the County Superintendent's O tee, 
and disbursed by him for the per cent. now allowed. County Superintendents 
ought to be required to give bond in open court, for such amount as the court may 
tequire. The scholastic population ought to be reported to the State Superintend~ 
ent by the Ist of Mav, and the apportionment made by the first of July, The 
school term of five months ought to be divided, when it is thought necessary—one- 
half in the Fall, and the other in the Spring. The people should be compelled to 
furnish good school. houses, or forfeit their school funds, and required to send their | 
children to school. . 
These are changes that, in my opinion, would add to the present school system 
already, in my opinion, far better than we have ever had in the State. 
With these suggestions, I have the honor to remain, : 
Your obedient servant, 
W. M. WILLHOITE, 
Superintendent Bradley County.

How. Jonw Eaton, Jx., Superintendent Public Instruction :--March 13th, 1869.— 
Sra: I see it announced through the press that the apportionment of school funds, 
from the tax for the year 1868, hus been made. I hope to be able to show that 
our efforts in the cause of universal education have not proveda failure. Not- 
withstanding all opposition, and the. uncertainty of securing funds with which to 
pay off, we have had taught-twenty-seven schools in the county. I anticipate 
no trouble in the future in the matter of opening schools, as I find that the prospect 
of getting public funds with which to pay off the oldclaims, gives confidence 
that nothing else could, in the stability of the present efficient school system,

Claiborne County. — September 80th, 1869. 
Hon, Joun Eaton, Jn., Superintendent Public Instruction —Sir: In compliance 
with circular letter. from your office, under date of September 11th, 1869, I herewith 
submit my report of the working of the Free School system in my County. 
I make this report to cover the workings of the system since the organization of 
the office, October 27th, 1867, a8 far as the data at hand will admit, alth ugh my 
appointment only dates from August 17th, 1869. Atthe time cf the appointment of 
the first Superintendent there had been no schools (either public or private) taught 
for six years, and there seemed to be no interest manifested in the cause of educa- 
tion, The people had no corifidence in the ability or willingness of the State to | 
assume the education of their children, and in the original organization the Super- 
intendent was almost invariably met with: “We have tried one school law, and it 
has been Of no benefit to us, and it is useless to go to any expense’ or labor in the 
matter, as it.can be of no earthly use.” However, the Superintendent succeeded in 
perfecting the organization and making the first report of scholastic population in 
December of 1867, but Was at that time unable to build any school-houses. He 
canvassed the county again in May, June and July, of 1868, and succeeded in get. 
ting interest enough awakened to be able to prevail upon directors in some of the 
districts to open schools. The number opened in July, August and September, 1868, 
was 47, These schools were so much of a success, although the grade of teachers 
were very low, that there was a great interest awakened in every neigh- 
borhood in the County; and although the teachers were compelled to wait six 
months, after the close of the schools, for their pay, they were not paid more than 
75 per cent. of their claims in any case, and often not more than 50. There have 
been up to date 62 schools opened in the County, during this year, the teachers 
risking the apportionment of 1868 for their pay. Under the present system there 
have been more schools opened, and a larger enrollment of pupils made in the two 
years that it has been in force, and more good accomplished to the children of the 
county than was done under the old system during its entire enforcement. There 
have been, since January, 1st, 1869, twenty school-houses built in the county, | the 
buildings are much more comfortable than those built prior to the war, but are by 
no means noted for their elegance or comfort. One improvement introduced into 
most of them is in the matter of combination seats and desks to take the place of 
the old slabs with wooden pegs, that had become as much of a fixture of our school- 
houses, as Webster’s Elementary Speller. 
If the present law, perhaps with some modification as to Sub-District Directors 
is continued, there will be scarcely a child of school age in the county, either 
white or black, that can not read and write in 1871. If the law is entirely re- 
pealed, we may make up our minds to go back to barbarism.

J. I. HOLLINGSWORTH, 
Superintendent Claiborne County. 
Cumberland County, January 12th, 1869.—For various reasons the people 
of this county desire that. Free Schools should not be opened until July Ist, 
1869, * we * The discussion, pro and con, of school officers will, I believe 
finally result in establishing the present school system, upon a more permanent

October 15th, 1860.—But few of our teachers are properly qualified for their 
high calling, education having heretofore been at so low an ebb; therefore our 
schools are nearly ull of a primary grade. Our school-houses are very inferior, 
but I can not expect improvements until such time as the necessary funds can 
be raised by local taxation, N. T. CUSTEAD, Superintendent. 
Fentress County, February 20th, 1869—We were unable to open any 
schools in our county in 1868, as all of our school-houses were destroyed during 
the war, and it was impossible to impress our people with sufficient confidence 
in the certainty of receiving funds from the State with which to carry them on 
to, build the neceseary houses; but I trust that we shall be able to perfect an 
organization this year. 
August 14th, 1869.1 have pledged myself to our people that there would 
certainly be funds with which to pay off the claims of teachers of our schools 
now in progress, upon their close; and have succeeded in opening ten, and will 
certainly have fourteen more opened by the 80th inst., making in all twenty-four. 
L. C. WRIGHT, Superintendent 
Grainger County, January 12th, 1869.—I find it very difficult to get the di- 
rectors to act in unison; and, further, they are slow and exceedingly careless in 
the matter of making the necessary reports. 
March 25th, 1869.—The feeling towards the present free school system is im- 
proving, and I trust that I shall be able to have schools opened in every dis- 
trict in the county this year. INO. MURPHEY, Superintendent. 
After Mr. Murphey’s resignation, H. Clay Griffith, his successor, writes: 
October 5th, 1869.The schools are now in operation in every civil district in 
the county, and are giving general satisfaction. 
Greene County, August 19th, 1868.—After much work in organizing the 
schools, and careful attention to the details of the system, I would suggest that 
the following would be improvements: 
I. In each civil district elect three directors, who should, like other county 
officers, be paid for their services. Do away entirely with sub directors. They 
complicate the machinery, aud hinder its easy and smooth working. 
IL Instead of one five months’ session in the year, have two sessions of three 
months each—one in winter, and the other in summer.’ This arrangement will 
better suit the convenience and the wants of all ages and of all classes, 
III. Each child of school-going age should be compelled by law to be in 
school at least three months each year,-unless kept out by sickness or the like. 
Without such compulsion, not over half of the children will be in school. 
W. B. RANKIN, Superintendent. 
Hamilton County, September 80th, 1869.—In closing my second annual re- 
port, and perhaps my last, as County Superintend: nt, it is but natural to take 
a look over one’s shoulder, as if he stood upon some eminence. 
This look produces a double-emotion, strangely mingled. If it were possible 
for regrets to make good the mistakes and the failures of the past, how deep and 
how pungent might those regrets be! ‘As none know the road better than he 
who has often traveled it, so none, perhaps, will better understand the feelings 
of a fellow-laborer in this great cause than yourself.

have held for the past two years as State Superintendent, I would feign bear tes- 
timony to your persistent fidelity. More than once, but for your words of hope and

discouragements which at times seemed heavier than mountains.

Hancock County.— , 
Hawkins County, April 17th, 1869.—The money that came into my bands 
for school purposes created quite a sensation through the county, inspiring all 
classes with confidence relative to the forthcoming of the funds in future. 
August 7th, 1869.—The cause of education will suffer greatly in my county, 
unless Iam able to get the Comptroller's warrant, which I hold on the appor- 
tionment of the school fund for 1869, cashed soon. The report is prevalent 
through the county that there is no money with which to pay off the claims of 
teachers, and unless the funds are forthcoming it will be quite impossible to em- 
ploy teachers for the schools of the county this year. Some of those who taught 
last year are really suffering for the funds so long due them. If these claims 
are not paid off soon, it will be useless to attempt to open schools in the county 
this year. 
Johnson County, November 8th, 1867.—I received my appointment as 
County Superintendent, October 3d, 1867, and as it was necessary for me to start 
for Nashville November 10, my time for organizing was necessarily limited to 
ten days. It was unfortunately necessary for me to ride into every district, also 
to write notices of the election of directors, and to urge citizens to attend. When
-P-A-G-E-281
CXXV 
it became apparent to me that directors could not be chosen in time to.secure the 
report of scholastic population, my best resort was to find “public-spirited gentle- 
men” who would perform the labor gratuitiously—a consummation devoutly to be 
wished but seldom obtained. Allow me to suggest the absolute necessity of so 
amending the law as to allow appointment of directors in such districts as fail to 
elect them, ‘ 
Jane 2d, 1869.—My schools have closed their sessions, and if I can pay y the 
teachers the amounts due, I shall have no difficulty § in opening all of the schools 
in the county during the next fiscal year. G, A. GRACE, Sup’t. 
Jefferson County, February 10, 1868.—1. The first great difficulty came at the 
very outset; namely, the difficu'ty of putting the system into actual operation, 
and thus getting free schools opened and working. I found, on examination, 
that in 1840, the county had been laid off into 47 districts; and later, by sub- 
divisions, into 63. There was great ignorance of the boundaries of the districts: 
afact which made it hard to get the machinery to moving. Also, there was great 
ignorance of what the law requires in the matter of schools for the colored chil- 
dren, As soon as these two matters were clearly explained, there was no diffi- 
culty in getting the choicest citizens to act as school directors-—among them the 
Judge of the Circuit Court; also, the wealthiest and most energetic and enter- 
prising business man in the county, Col. Samuel Fain, of Mossy Creek, who re- 
ports a good new frame house, at his own cost, now ready for occupation by a 
free school, and to be forever given to that purpose, 
I. But the greatest difficulty of all lies in the distrust prevailing everywhere, 
and directed against the State officers, growing out of the loss of the permanent 
school fund and the using of school revenue to pay interest due from railroads; 
adistrust which no amount of argument relieves. The only thing that has done 
anything towartls laying this feeling, was the receipt of the apportionment of 
487-100 cents out of the school tax of 1866. If, now, the taxes of 1867 and 1868 
could have been apportioned and disbursed promptly—disbursed when they ought 
tohave been-—all this distrast would have vanished. As to the misuse of the 
school tax by State officers, three opinions, expressed by three different men of 
high standing and consideration in the county, deserve notice. They are severally 
as follows: 
Ist. That the Legislature ought to pass a law making it a felony for any State 
officer to delay beyond a certain day (of each year) fixed by law, the apportion- 
ment of the school revenue. 
24, That the State Superintendent ought at once to sue out a mandamus directed 
to the Comptroller, for the purpose of speedily getting an apportionment of the 
schocl moneys now lying in the State Treasury, and long ago due to the counties. 
8d. That so long as we pay heavy taxes for the express purpose of 1 taaintaining 
free schools, and yet by reason of the wrong-doing of State officers, have so little 
return in the shape of schools, the system will be a nullity and a sham. 
September 25, 1869.—At this date; I am able to say that our people arc, as a 
whole, in favor of the school system. ‘They want it fairly tried. Persons of all 
shades of political opinion agree in this—the exceptions are few. Thave no re- 
commendations to offer respecting changes in the law, further than a provision for 
voluntary local taxation for -building school-houses, and for similar purpo-cs. Ag 
to putting the school money in the bands of the County Trustee to dishu 
can see no advantages and several disadvantages: 1, It will cost more than 1}

per cent, if the work of making out frequent requisitions be laid upon the Trus. 
tee. 2d, There would surely be conflicts of opinion between Trustee and Super. 
intendent as to whether this and that teacher deserve pay. 3d. The managing of 
school matters, instead of being simplified by such a course, would be made com- 
lex and fuil of petty annoyances,

Knoxville, Tenn., October Ist, 1869. 
“Hon. Joux Eaton, In., Superintendent Public Instruction : 2 in conformity with 
the law, I have the honor herewith to transmit my annual report. 
I received my appointment October 17th, 1867, took the oath of office and entered 
upon the discharge of my duties October 27th, 1867. 
I found the County sub-divided into eighty-two School Districts, making from 
8 to 6 sub-districis in-each of the ten Civil Districts of the County—these in the 
new organization were reduced in number to 75, and now consist of ‘but 64, several 
of the best organized districts having énlarged their first sub-District boundaries 
until they are identical with those of the Civil District, thus obliterating the 
troublesome subs. Some considerable trouble was experienced by the County Su- 
perintendent in finding willing hands to assist in the organization of the districts, 
filling the posts of Directors, teking the scholastic enumeration, ete. In many dis- 
tricts parties were employed and. paid for enumerating the scholars; in others the 
Jabor was performed cheerfully by Directors properly electéd and anxious to try 
the new system which promised » five months school, and to such I return my 
warmest thanks, for by their timely assistance I was enabled, by dint of persever- 
ance, to overcome all obstacles and report my County organized. . 
The first schools were opened in the 18th Civil District, May 14jh, 1868. The 
last school reported as opening September 13th, 1869, making the 126th schoo} 
opened in the County, and increasing the enrollment of different scholars to nearly 
7,000, [See Statistical Report appended.] The schools were taught hy 107 differ- 
ent teachers—86 male, 21 female, 99 white and 8 colored; there having been 7 
white teachers in colored schools, 8 male and 8 female: 108 schools for white, and 
28 schools for colored children. 
During this time there have been 26 school-houses built, 16 for white and 10 for 
colored children; of the latter number, the Fréedmen’s Bureau assisted in the con- 
struction of four (4). The majority of houges in the county used for school pur- 
poses have been built by private enterprise and general subscription, and are situ- 
ated on ground owned by individuals. Of the new school-house sites, 14 have 
been secured in the name of the Civil District Boards. Their construction is gen- 
erally of hewn logs, frequently unhewn, with bark on, and afew frame. One brick- 
“house has beon erected at Mars Hill, 11th Civil District, in place ofa miserable hut 
rudely constructed of poles without chinking or daubing, doors or windows to protect 
the inmates from the inclemencies of the weather. But to the credit of the Direct- 
ors, patrons and friends of the school, be it said, that they are awakened on the 
subject of education and are now taking the lead in advancing Free Public Schools. 
The schools in the county are generally without apparatus of any kind, not even 
black-boards or maps. The furniture is of most primitive style—benches without 
backs being the soft side of an oak or poplar slab supported by wooden pegs, which 
often penetrate the upper surface, much to the annoyance of the pupils perched 
upon them; for they are generally too high for » majority of the scholars. A board
-P-A-G-E-283
OxxviL 
placed horizontal on pins inserted in the wall answers all purposes, viz: General 
receptacle for hats, caps, bonnets, shawls, dinner-baskets, buckets, ete; also a place 
to write; the'scholars taking turns for position. . 
The Mth Civil District takes the palm in the erection of new school buildings 
during the past year, having secured the titles to the sites, and built four new 
houses—three of hewn logs and one frame—and furnishing the same with stoves, 
black. boards and improved seats. . ‘ 
Knoxville, the county seat of Knox County, is the most important point in the 
Eastern Division of the State, with a population variously estimated at from 10,000 
to 15,000—is composed of the First and part of the Second Civil Districts. It has 
no public or free school buildings, The public schools were opened in July, 1868. 
The Board of Education finding it necessary to rent buildings at ‘high rates, did so 
with great reluctance. As the schools progressed they grew in public favor, and 
ere the complction of the first month, were crowded to overflowing. It was found 
necessary to suspend them during a portion of August and rent and fit more build- 
ings, To do this means were necessary. The Board had none at their disposal. 
But believing that the necessary amount could and would be raised as provided for 
by law, the Superintendent, with the aid of one gentleman, resident of Nashville, 
procured and advanced the necessary funds to repair, heat and furnish the neces- 
sary rooms—furnishing accommodations for 1,196 pupils in the First District, and 
236 in that part of the Second, lying within the city limits. For report of the First 
see Appendix E. The schools were graded with some.difficulty. All the accommo- 
dations offered were accepted, and the Free Schools grew in public favor, being pat- 
ronized by all classes without reference to previous prejudices—--the word politics 
being banished from the school-rooms. A full corps of intelligent teachers labored 
diligently, aud they were rewarded by beholding their labors crowned with success. 
Four hundred and Ninety-one Dollars and twenty-six cents was drawn from the 
State Treasury August 2lst, 1868, for this district, ‘This amount, together with the 
procecds of the sale of some old funds, State Bank of Tennessee, received from the 
late County Trastve, Hiram Barry, Eyq., belonging to this district, enabled the Su- 
perintendeut to meet promptly the first months’ salaries due the teachers, but Sep_ 
tember, October, November and December éame in turn, and no’ money came from 
the State on 1867 moneys due the county, At intervals during three months, the 
Exchange and Deposit Bank advanced the September’ money to assist the teachers 
in their necessities---this was returned from the 1867 fund when apportioned. Jan- 
uary Sth, 1869, through Dr, Barnas Sears, $2,000-was received from the Peabody 
Fund, $1,000 to be applied to the paynient of teachers’ salaries and $1,000 to meet 
current expenses. “Thanks to the courteous and efficient agent, Dr. Sears, for this 
timely relief, and all honor to the distinguished philanthropist, George Peabody 
for his generous kindness to the children of the South. The Board of Education 
proceeding in conformity to the law had estimates prepared for supplying the ne- 
cessary, deficits, ctc., when the Supreme Court of the State rendered its decision 
in the Clarksville case pronouncing those sections of the law, authorizing 
taxation, etc., nuil and void, Being in Nashville at the time the decision was rend- 
ered, the Legislature still in session, I procured the introduction and passage of an 
amendment to the Charter of the City of Knoxville, giving them all the rights and 
privileges with regard to the organization and maintenance of a public school sys- 
tem, enjoyed by the City of Nashville, I presented the maiter to the City Board of 
Mayor and Aldermen, the amendment was accepted, and the question submitted to 
the people on the first Saturday in April, 1869, whether or not they would submit

to an assessment of three mills upon the dollar taxable property, for the support 
and maintenance of the publicschools, The tickets read “Free Public Schools open 
toall,” “Assessment” or “No Assessment.” The vote carried; but for reasons bet- 
ter known to the Board than to the public, the assessment never has been made 
and the city corporate has never given one dollar to the support of public schools: 
She has received from the State two apportionments, that of 1866, $491.26, and 
1869, $1,734.21. One more is due, yes, past due 9 months, that of 1868, with which 
the balances due'teachers, who have waited long and patiently will be paid, when 
received from the State. 
After the decision of the Supreme Court and the non-appropriation by the city, 
the schools closed in the midst of a prosperous session, and at the lowest estimate, 
five hundred children, whose parents are unable to keep them in private schools at 
the present high rates of tuition, are turned into the streets, there to grow up 
steeped in vice and ignorance, educated in the street school for crime’s darkest 
pages, to be registered on the Recorder’s books and in the Police reports as villains, 
rather than in moral and intellectual schools, receiving that instruction which 
would fit them for honest neighbors and good, enterprising citizens. Yes, the rich 
and prosperous city, with ber estimated taxable $3,000 000 and upwards of proper- 
ty, paying (for police force) as per letter of Recorder W. H. Swan, from October 
Ast, 1867, to October Ist, 1869, $12,560. Amount of fines assessed in these two 
years, about $8,000; and not one dollar for public schools. 
While her prominent financiers and influential citizens are exercised over pro- 
jects to enhance the mechanical .and manufacturing interests of the city in publie 
meetings and otherwise, I have not noticed that it has once been suggested that a 
public school system would bethe greatest and most swecessfud emigration scheme ever 
started. Capital and skillful labor must come hand in hand, and each work for 
the mutual benefit of the other. . Natural and vast resources has the State to attract 
the capitalist, but little to induce the poor, yet skillful and intelligent mechanic 
Even advanced wages will not induce the steady artificer to leave his work shop in 
the thriving manufacturing cities of the East, and remove his family of growing 
children from the advantages 6f a good practical education in the free public 
schools of those cities to one where tuition and chargesin private schools practically 
exclude the working classes, or Consume their scanty substance. The mechanic’s 
first question is, when asked to emigrate, “Have you a good system of free public 
schools where my children can be educated?” What is the answer, and what the 
result? The vast and undeveloped resources of the: South answer _ The richest 
in the world—we lie untouched. . 
The schools of the county have been all that could be expected, all things con- 
sidered, and clearly manifest the superiority of the present over the former system. 
The free schools met with strong opposition at the outset, but I am pleased to state 
that there is now a growing desire in this county for their success; and this in the 
face of the fact that to this day-a majority of the teachers have balances due them 
for services rendered months ago. The unfortunate rotten condition of State 
finances I consider the great drawback to the complete success of the present sys- 
tem of public schools. 
The friends of the system all acknowledge its defects, but they can be remedied 
by judi-ivus legislation. But just so long as funds collected for school purposes 
and pad into the State Treasury can ‘be, and are, used for any and all other pur- 
poses, w.thout reference to the law on the subject, [See Appendix, H.,] just so long 
will tus or any other system, be crippled in its practical workings, and complaints
-P-A-G-E-285
OXxIx 
toa greater or less extent will be made against the school, school system, school of- 
era,and everybody connected with the schools. While the condition of the schools 
hasbeen generaily prosperous, surpassing anything heretofore known, yet we by 
np means hold that there have not been other and just grounds for complaint. 
Grave causes for complaint often exist, arising from local circumstances, ete., 
i.¢, the’passions and prejudices of men, the ‘neglect of school officers, the ineffi- 
ciency of teachers, the defects of the law relative to the construction of suitable 
achool- houses, and the fitting of the same—that it does not work as fairly and 
evenly as it is intended in mountainous regtons—too many sub- -divisions, too many 
school officers, etc. The difficulty lies in finding a remedy fur these defects; yet 
we believe that the law might be more completely adapted to the situation, thus 
perfecting a system calculated to give all, even the poorest, who may choose to 
accept the privileges offered, a thorough knowledge of the essential branches of a 
common English education, and in its higher graded schools afford places of learn- 
ing, where the ambitious poor, as well as the rich, could acquire. polished educa- 
tion. The education of the people, from the humblest to the highest, is a social 
and public necessity. Ignorance is the mother of vice and crime. Her votaries 
are most easily led by demagogues and conspirators. ‘Just in proportion as the 
common people are. educated, are their political and social rights, their per- 
sonal and private liberties. safe. The history of millions prove this. 
Public schools should be opened by reading a passage of Scripture and the repe~ 
tition of “The Lord’s Prayer,” either by the teacher alone, or the sehool repeat~ 
ing in concert after the teacher, or, if preferable, a voluntary prayer by the 
teacher. The “Bible,” the “fountain of all knowledge” should be in every gchool- 
Toom and a portion of sacred pages read daily. Guard well the “portals” of your 
Schools in this respect, Let moral and religious training be ever upper- 
most in your daily introduction. Do not understand me to mean sectarianism. 
Nol Call the attention of your pupils to these divine truths, i, ¢: Obey, because it 
is right; study, because it is right, etc. Man, without moral culture, becomes.a 
monster, and the more his intellect is cultivated the more dangerous he becomes... 
A teacher failing to teach morality fails to perform his or ‘her duty. 
Having strenuously’ advocated moral and religious training in the- public:~. 
schools, I am pleased to report that it has ‘been attended with very gratifying . 
results upon both teacher and pupil. 
As the child enters the school-room, place in its hands a slate and pencil. If 
you have alphabetic and word charts, use these in place of the primer-or-spellers 
When a character or mark. is pointed out to the child, and it is told that the. 
name of that character is A, it should then be taught to print the character on, 
its slate; then B, 6 ete. through the alphabet, in the same manner. When it. 
has learned two or more letters, these may be formed into a word, if it, be the. 
name of some familiar object or animal, as Hat, Dog, etc. Some use the. “word. 
method” from the beginning, with very good success, using words and a few 
short sentences, containing all the letters. Thus you occupy the mind and. fingers 
of the child, and little difficulty will be experienced in governing, if the latter 
are kept employed. By this meana, it is believed that the form of. the letter or 
word is more definitely fixed in the mind, and thus a proper basis is laid: for cor- 
tect spelling, both oral and written. Experience has confirmed me in the. belief 
that the course thus. marked out, if followed through school days, learning to 
write from dictation with rapidity, is a wise one. Scholars thus taught, can

hardly fail to be able to oxpress their sentiments and thoughts in a clear and 
forcible manner. : 
Extracts from my recommendations on the manner and style of pursuing other 
branches of study might be proper, but time and space forbid. : 
On the subjects of text-books, no radical changes were recommended. 
My method of examining teachers for certificates, is written and oral. Written 
answers to the questions in Grammar, Arithmetic and Geography, are required: 
in other branches, the examination. is oral, The written examinations of each 
applicant are kept on file. . 
The Knox County Teachers’ Institute was organized during the month of 
August, 1868, and held its first regular session November 20th and 2tst, with 
flattering success. The second session, held February 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th, 
1869, was largely attended, not ‘only by teachers of the county, but by teachers 
and superintendents from other counties, and the-friends of education generally, 
The third session was held July 28th and 29th, and again August-14th and 15th, 
met in joint session with an educational convention. . 
Many teachers, abandoning the “old-field” plan of allowing scholars to study 
aloud, have adopted the silent study system, with general and specific directions 
as to calling classes and conducting recitations. About fifty teachers report 
good success, and say that the syStem of calling classes by signal, requiring the 
scholars to move to and from recitations in a regular manner; to arise and as- 
sume a standing posture during recitation, remaining seated while the balance 
of the class.are reciting, etc., has resulted in disciplining their schools almost 
imperceptibly to an extent never attained before, and’ with little seeming exer- 
tion. 
A. true teacher loves ‘his work. He does not go plodding through his duties day 
after day, but, with spirit and energy, brings new attractions, and opens daily to 
the minds of his pupils a new life, full of information. The true teacher -feelg 
an interest in his pupils; he takes pleasure in pointing out the better way; his 
grand motive is to do good. He is always jirm; ‘having once taken a position, he 
only yields when he finds he is in the wrong; his rules are few and simple, but 
he requires them to be promptly obeyed. Yet, with all his firmness, he unites a 
kind and mild manner. He strives to understand what he teaches: to do this, 
he is a constant student, reviewing the lessons before going before his classes, 
He is posted as to what is transpiring around him; he reads the current news, 
and the edugational journals; he never loses an opportunity to add to his pro- 
fessional knowledge and skill; he teaches the child to wse to the best advantage 
ALL the faculties God has given it; and-herein lies the secret of “How To DU. 
OATE;” he teaches the child to sce what he looks at; to understand what he sees 
and to remember it so well that he can tell it afterward.. The true teacher is 
well versed in books and abstract science, but knows a vast deal more of practical 
life, learned from personal observation and experience, and is thus the better 
prepared for the ‘world’s broad field of battle ;” and as is the teacher, so will 
the scholar become, to a greater or less extent, by those involuntary influences, 
powerfully impressed by his presence and pervading spirit; his-every act and 
habit is swelled into importance, as associated-with his position; his general 
temper ‘and spirit become the prevailing spirit of the school. If there is a 
roughness and want of refinement in the teacher's address, all. his awkard and 
ungraceful phrases and manners, greatly exaggerated, will re-appear in the con- 
versation and intercourse of the scholars. How perfect then should he be!

An eminent writer says: “The character of a State depends upon the character

The only means the Board yill have for liquidating the above, will be the ap- 
portioument of 1868, which is now due, but has not yet been paid by the Comp- 
troller of the State, It will-probably be quite sufficient for that purpose. 
It is due to Col. Wilcox, Superintendent of:Public Instruction, to state that which 
is known only to the Board, that when the Public Schools were opened in July and 
September, 1868, no funds were at the command of the Board with which to furnish 
the necessary accommodations for the large number of scholars seeking admission. 
Col. Wilcox procured and advanced means to'fitup every building for the white 
children in the City of Knoxville, as well as the needed furniture-for the colored 
schools and algo the rent for rooms. But little of this has been repaid, and he isto day 
the actual owner of the greater part of the school furniture in the public school- 
rooms of this city, no account for which is found in the foregoing statement. 
The suecess of the schools in thisdistrict isshown in the fact that the enumeration ~ 
was 1,508, and the number enrolled in the public schools. was 1,190. The average 
attendance was 81 percent. These results compare favorably with those of any 
of the old Staies, and are due very greatly to the @ efficiency of our Superintendent. 
By order of the Board, - 
Knorville, May 8th, 1869. 1 8. H. SMITH, Clerk. 
McMinn Co:nty.—December 14th, 1868.—I have organized and had taught 
thirty-four (34) schools in this county. How are the teachers to be paid? A gen- 
eral impression prevails that the State will never pay the teachers for their services, 
and unless they can be paid off now, it will be impossible to perfect the system. 
March 28d, 1869 ---The decision of the Supreme Court as to the unconstitution- 
ality of that part of the school law, empowering districts to lay.a special tax for 
school purposes, and the failure to get the funds due the children from-the “ peo- 
ple’s tax” has well nigh paralyzed our efforts'in the matter of opening schools. 
Marion County.—~Nothing. ’ 
Meigs County, July 30th, 1867.—I am called upon every day to know if there 
will be money to carry on our frée schools this year. If not, all our labor of or- 
ganization will be Mown away---utterly lost. 
E, H. MATTHEWS, Superisitendent. 
Monroe County, December 26th, 1868.—This county has a very strong element 
that is hostile to popular education ; and it sticks at nothing to embarrass the 
working of free schools. 
August 9, 1869.—Have opened ten schools in the second session. Think that 
with the lawful funds, promptly paid, we shall be able to do much good this year. 
F. BEALES, Superintendent. 
Morgan County, April 30, 1869,—I hereby respectfully tender my resignation 
ag County Superintendent of Morgan. My only reason for so doing is failing 
health. No branch of the public service so much demands vigorous realth as this; 
for the Superintendent must be always about, and will find it necessary to do the 
greater part of the ‘daty of all the school officers of the county.

June 7, 1869,---Highteen of our schools have closed; and two others now in 
session will close soon. Some of these schools I have visited four times; the rest, 
twice. The amount due to teachers is $3,675. I have been holding the office 18 
months; during which the organization of the schools has been made: My pay for

September 30, 1869.-.-I think the State Superintendent should be elected by the 
Legislature, or else appointed by the Governor, and confirmed by the Senate. If 
the people fail 'to elect directors, théy should be appointed by the County Superin- 
tendent, but not confirmed by the State Superintendent. The Comptroller should 
be compelled to declare the yearly apportionment of school money a year -earlier 
than he hag hitherto doneit. The moneys taken from schools to pay other State 
debts, should be repaid at the earliest possible day. Parents should be compelled 
by law to send their children to school. Sub-Districts are a hindrance instead of a 
help, They should be done away with. Three directors are enough to do ‘all the 
school business of a Civil District. We have had much trouble with worthless 
school-houses, in winter time. Asa general thing, the people feel no interest j 
building new school-houses, or in making the old ones decent and comfortable.

fidence will be restored, at once, and all opposition will speedily die out.

cation of the people, H. C. ROGERS, Sup’t,

money for my own profit; whereas I have in fact received no money at all for any

perfeot success. Men who did everything in their power to put them down are now 
giving in and acknowledging that the system isa much better one than they had 
thought it to be. . . J BR THOMAS, Supt. 
Davidson County.—Now that we have had nearly two years of the present 
school system, we should be able to say somethiug concerning it, and give the 
public some information as to what has been accomplished under it... 
In putting the present school system in operation, we had difficulties without 
end to contend against, all of which are now in a measure overcome; at least 
the poverty, prejudice, and want of buildings, occasioned by the late war. 
At first every thing was to be done, and we had ‘nothing with which to do it; 
for the war had left hardly the skeleton of an educational spirit. Directors were 
to beelecied; but in only a few Civil Districts would the people hold the elec- 
tions, and in still fewer cases would the men‘act when elected to that office, 
The County Superintendent had to ride almost ‘day and night, for over six - 
months, before he got the scholastic population of the county. At last, this was 
accomplished, and a few schools started in the Civil Districts immediately around 
the city, All over the county, the people began to get interested in school mat- 
ters, and were talking of building or repairing houses, and starting schools, when 
the news went forth, the School Fund is lost, and there is not a cent with 
which to pay the teachers.” The ill-fated breeze, which brought the unweleome 
news, bore down with it what little faith the people had in the school system, 
and cast us back to the foot of the hill, upa part of which we had climbed with 
such difficulty. 
‘When we recovered from the shock, and gazed at the ground passed over in 
vain, we must confess, that we were discouraged, but not cast down. We col- 
lected our energies, and went to work ona second ascent, which, we found more 
difficult than the first, on account of néw obstacles in the way, which our inglori- 
ous descent threw up. This time we had to meet and overcome both difficulty 
and insult, in almost every place we went on Public School business, up to the 
first of August, 1868, at which time there was an apportionment announced for 
the payment of teachers, which in a measure stemmed the tide of wrath which 
was flowing against the Free Schoo) officers. . 
‘This, although not one-fourth of what we should have had, was a fulcrum upon 
which to place the school lever and shove along the system; or, rather, it was 
something which enabled us-to persuade the people into doing their children jus- 
tice, by starting schools for them. It also enabled us to get teachers to accept 
positions in the frée schools, who before would not touch them, because the one 
or two who had taught on faith had not yet been rewarded, Men cannot be ex- 
pected to be willing to labor where the prospect for wages is poor. ~ 
| Among the great difficulties to be overcome, one of the greatest was the get- 
ting colored schools started. There were no houses for that purpose, and there 
was a general prejudice against negro education, so that there were only a few 
white people who would, ‘and dared assist, the colored people in building school- 
houses. In most casés, they were too poor to build them for themselves, The 
Freedmen's Bureau assisted, in some cases, to build school-houses; but it did not 
do half that it could or might have done. . 
The agent, we think, lost sight of “the greatest good to the greatest numbers 7 
or, in other words, the public good, by keeping his eyes too closely fixed upon 
what might be called private enterprises, as they are more denommational than

national. But this, with all other difficulties, was overcome, so that before the 
end of the year 1868, with the exception of one Civjl District, the schools of Da- 
vidson County were fully organized; and, even in that one, two free white 
schools were taught, so that the adage was verified, “labor ominia vincit. 
During the progress of the schools the first year, five schoul-houses were burnt 
~four colored, and one white—by some malignant parties, who prefer i ignorance 
to knowledge, and vice to virtue. But as evidence that there is more satisfaction 
than dissastisfaction among. the people, as such, with the present system, for the 
five school houses that were burnt, twenty mew ones have been built ia the 
county. Where we could scarcely get a director to serve, they are now compet- 
ing for the position, and serving well; where we could hardly get.a teacher to ac- 
cept of a situation in the Free Schools, we have three applicants for every posi- 
tion that opens. 
These things go to show that the system is gaining the confidence of the peo- 
ple; and, indeed, there would be no lack of confidence if the State would only do 
its duty, and make the apportionment of each year’s School Fund within the year. 
For it has been the uncertainty of how much, and when the School Fund would 
come, that has caused thé want of faith, and the dissatisfaction among the peo- 
ple. Here, just now, is an instance of the bad treatment of the school system 
by the State. We have never so much as heard of the money for 1868, although 
the year 1869 is almost gone. Such. treatment as this would damn any school 
system; and the only wonder is, that so much has been done. 
The school: Jaw tay require improvement, and does, as nothing human is per- 
fect. But in spite of its imperfections, and the almost insurmountable difficul- 
ties with which the school officers had to contend, much has been done to estab- 
lish a permanent free school system in Tennesseo. I might venture to say, that 
more has been done here to that end than in any other State in the Union in 
the same time,under similar circumstances, Take Davidson County for an in- 
stance: During the year ending Sept. 80th, 1869, nearly one hundred schools, of 
five months, have been taught outside the city of Nashville; about thirty of 
these colored. Ten thousand, or over, have been reported enrolled in schcol, out 
of a scholastic population uf over sixteen thousand. It js our opinion, that the 
above is a good showing for the first year of.a school system, as it really was the 
first year of operations—the time previous being as good as lost by the failure to 
get the School Fund, 
These facts and figures are the arguments we present in favor of the school sys- 
tem; and, in our opinion, the are in themselves conclusive. Wherever there has 
been the slightest sign ot its proving a failure, those signs were caused by, the 
State acting in bad faith; in keeping back the School Fund for nearly two 
years after it became due; and, misapplying it in paying the interest of the 
State debt, etc, and not from any thirig in itself. 
I hereby resign my office, and am happy.to know Dr. A. J. Roper is to be ap- 
pointed in my stead. In him I have the utmost confidence, as to his ability, in- 
tegrity and love of popular education; and ask for him the hearty co-operation 
of directors, teachers, and all friends of education in the county. I would sug- 
gest that every Civil District should be incorporated for school purposes, and 
all sub-districts abolished. "With thig change, the system is a success: it may be 
without it, ~ , J.P. McK EE.

Dickson County, April 20, 1869.—Our people have so much distrust about 
the State officers doing their legal duty in the matter of paying over to schools the 
tax which was levied and ‘collected for schools, that they hang back very much 
from organizing and opening the schools. If the money could only be had promptly, 
there would be no delay and no troubleat all.. * * #* Besides this outside diffi- 
culty, (arising from the neglect. of official duty by certain State officers at the 
Capital), there is much home opposition from ignorance, bigotry, narrowness and 
prejudice among our own citizens, : Tf. F, McCREARY, Sup’t.

Hon. Joun Eaton, JR., Superintendent of Public Instruction, Nashville, Tenn.— 
Dar S1z:—In compliance with the requirements of the law, I hereby respectfully 
present you my annual report of the free schools of: Giles County. 
Thave issued 54 certificates to teachers; 41 to whites, and 18 to’ colored-—all of 
the second and third grade. A few of those to whom certificates were given, took 
no schools, and others are teaching the third term with second certificate. 
Although the number of schools opened in this county in the year 1869 ig not 
quite half the number that should have been opened, yet when we consider that 
with our untiring efforts, we opened but three schools in 1868, we feel encouraged 
to believe that with proper supervision, our system will be'a final success. 
Iwould recommend a change in the time of taking the. scholastic population, 
(see. '7,) for two reasons: Ist, It is the busiest time of the year with farmers; and 
2d, It makes the basis of appropriation of a given year depend upon the enumet- 
ation of the preceding year. . 
Twould add also, that many districts that have refused to report this year, by 
which they would be deprived of the benefits of the school fund for 1870, cou'd be 
induced to report and organize schools, I therefore respectfully recommend to our 
Legislature to have the law amended to require the taking of the scholastic popu- 
Jation early in January of each year. I would also recommend any legislation 
that wouid more effectually guard our school fund, and have it apprepriated to its 
legitimate uses. Very respectfully,

   system in this part of the State. Immediately upon receiving my appointment it 
1867, I proceeded to canyass the county preparatory to organizing the schools, 
The people generally went to work to build and repair school-houses, but lack o1 
confidence in the State Treasury soon cast a damper upon their energies, and thi 
whole work’ ceased, 
In the summer following, I called teachers and directors together and organized 
a County Educational Association. I then canvassed the county, addressing the 
people, and after many tribulations I succeeded in-.awakening the people to the 
importance of the subject, and inspiring them with sufficient confidence in financial 
affairs so that by the middle of September most of the districts had orgavized their 
schools, And here I claim-also to have led the other counties surrounding me. 
When the great majority of my schools were opened, directors from neighboring 
counties called upon me for information and instruction upon the law, etc. The 
organization of schools in this county gave an impetus to the‘neighboring counties. 
In September I required teachers: to dismiss schools and organize a “Teachers’ 
Institute,” which was attended by nearly all the teachers in the county,.continu- 
ing four days. From the first. of August until the last of January, 1 was in the 
saddle nine-tenths of the time. I have visited every Educational Association 
which has met at Nashville since my appointment. Ihave spent from my own 
pocket, between two.and three hundred dollars, expenses necessarily attached to the 
performance of my duties. The difficulties have been, first to give the people con- 
fidence in the efficiency of free schools, the old school system having created a pre- 
judice against them, 2d. To establish confidence in the State finances. I had not 
only to contend with a lack of confidence in my own county, but'in the adjoining 
counties where also reports were in circulation derogatory to State ‘finances, owing 
to the fact that their Superintendents did ‘not labor sufficiently to dispel these 
wrong ideas, until nearly twe months after my schools were organized. 
The pesple of this county are generally in favor of the new school law, and the’ 
only drawback is-want of promptness in making State disbursements, The law 
should be so amended as to require the Comptroller to state by the first of July or 
June the amount due each child for the schools to be opened that year, 
The constitution should be so amended as to allow the Legislature the privilege to 
vest power in Educational Boards to raise local taxes, to build, repair school-houses 
nd pay teachers. I can see no reason why the school system should not be a oom. 
ess, if the State Government, will do its duty.

Gen. Joun Eaton, Superintendent Public Instruction, Nashville, Tennessee :— 
Dear Sir :-~In aiming to organize this county, the difficulties consisted of a re- 
luctance on the part of suitable persons to become Directors; unwillingness of 
teachers to take the risk of getting pay when the five months’ services ended; 
and deficiency in school-houses. At length, in each civil district, Directors were 
elected, or appointed. In July, 1868, teachers began to’ be willing to commence 
schools; and where school-houses were needed, the surrounding communities 
have done much in supplying the want.
-P-A-G-E-295
CXXXIX 
Between July, 1868, and July, 1869, the number of five months’ schools was 
seventy-four. one-third of which were for colored persons. The number now in 
operation is upward of eighty, and I expect this fall’s schools to be above ninety, 
for which we shall in due time, be looking for our portion of the fund of 1868, 
The first difficulties were, we ought to mention, some of another kind, though 
compared with the past, they are rather of a pleasing character. Formerly, I 
sought to persuade the people, to start the schools; now, they visit me, saying, 
‘sre wish schools to the amount of our portion of the school fund.” It may be 
safely said, though much needs yet to' be done, that the Public Schools of Maury 
County are a success. Respectfully yours, ~ Wm, MACK,

Montgom:ry County.— Clarksville, Tena., September 25, 1869. 
To Gun, Joun Eaton, Jr., Superintendent Public Instruction :—S1n:--Your 
letter of appointment was received on the 18th day of June, 1808, and on the 
20th of the same month, I entered upon the discharge of my duties, as Superin- 
tendent of Public Schools for Montgomery County. From that day, to the 
present time, I have uninterruptedly devoted myself to this business. 
At the date of my appointment, Civil Districts 4, 7, 12, 16, 17 and 19, were 
the only districts which had established public schools. Part of the other dis- 
iricts had elected Boards of School Directors, and part had nt. In some cases, 
also, there had been great difficulty experienced, in finding men willing to setve 
as Directors, By the exertions of my predecessor, many’ obstacles had been rb- 
moved, and a disposition to operate under the law, with the prospect of receiving 
-mMoney, was largely developed. ,The month of June, and the whole of July, 
were spent in preliminary wrk. After the annonncement of the first apportion- 
ment, August 18th, we began to sce a prospect of doing something effective and 
definite. When the people saw that money could actually be got out of the 
State Treasury for school purposes, and feeling everywhere the byrden of taxa- 
tion, they began to be in haste to avail themselves of all the advantages afforded 
them by the public school system. 
It is not possible, nor would it be profitable, to give a-history of all the local 
struggles, or even of the final triumphs of the friends of the system, in the nine- 
teen districts of this county. . It isenough to say here, and now---Ist, All the 
districts of this county have been organized under the law@g 2nd, That in each 
and every district one or more public schools have been taught the legal term of 
five mcnths® 8d,:That several districts hate enjoyed the benefit of such schools, 
several times, 4th, That sixty schools have been opened, ‘of which 46 were for 
white and 19 for colored children; 5th, That 1992 children have at various times 
been enrolled in these schools. 6th, That about $15,000in all have been earned 
by the public school teachers. 7th, That some $8,000 have been actually paid 
them for their services, according to law. 8th, That the remaining indebtedness 
of the State to the teachers has been liquidated, and will be paid as soon as funds 
have been received from the State Treasury for that purpose. And 9th, That 
there seems to be a general disposition on the part of the people to operate under 
the law, as fast a8 the means of sustaining schools in the several districts accu- 
mulate. 
The prejudice against the education of the colored people, which existed in 
this county two years ago, has given away wonderfully. Now, it is my pleasure 
to report, that we seldom meet with a person who does not admit the advantage 
of promoting this object.
-P-A-G-E-296

We have reason to believe that the principal opposition to our system of pub- 
lic schools, as at present established, and that is now operative, is founded on the 
following things. Ist, An unwillingness on thé part of many persons to pay 
any taxes, and especially taxes for ends that promote the general benefit, in a 
way which they cannot immediately see. 2nd, An unwillingness on the part 
of those who have at heavy expense educated their own children, or who are able 
to do so, to contribute for the cducation of other people’s children. 3d, Politi- 
cal prejudices arising from the past unhappy condition of a large part of the 
poople of the State. 4th, Mistuken views of the economy of any system of pub- 
lic education. And 5th, Mistaken impressions as to the expensiveness of the 
system established in this State. , . 
The first two grounds of objection exist in all communities, aid are not pecu- 
liar to the State of Tennessee. They can only be removed by the gradual opera- 
tion of time and improvement. Political prejudice will soon have no room for 
“exercise, since the. recent revolution has put the whole political power of the 
State in the hands of those who were exercised thereby, There can be little 
doubt, that the facts, which are spread out.in the statistical reports and judicial 
statements accompanying this report, and the general report from your office, 
will furnish everything necessary to remove all mistaken notions, which have 
hitherto hindered our progress. It ought to be enough then, to say, that when, 
ina half operative end developed system, thé same or better teachers can be 
employed, for from 5 to 6 dollars per scholar, -per term of five months, which in 
private schools cost from 10 to 15 dollars, the general economy of the system is 
evident, : 
The local, or county superintendence of the public schools of Montgomery 
County, for the laet fifteen months, has cost $84.27 per month. This sum has 
been about equal to 163 cents per year, for each scholar, per scholastic enumera- 
tion of the county, or about eléven per cent of the whole money received from 
the State. ee : 
The question of continuing the county superintendency of the Public Schools, 
‘thas been raised, and will most probably come before the next Legislature for 
consideration and final settlement. It is evident, that the work done by the 
County Superintendents must be done by some one; unless it can be dispensed 
with altogether. That it cannot be dispensed with, without injuring the effi- 
ciency of the publ: schools, is evident from several considerations. Ist, Every 
system of education has such work to do, and has made some provision for hav- 
ing itdone, 2nd, The principle of supervision is inherent inthe sministration 
of all public business, as is evidenced by the proverb, “What is everybody’s 
business is nobody’s business.” 3d. Under the old law, four different officers 
discharged the duties now required of one; the County Court Clerk, the. County 
Trustee, the Board of Examiners and the District Treasurer. It may be assumed, 
that if they did their work, they ought to have been paid for it, and that if they 
‘were not paid, it was because they did not do their work. Besides, under the old 
law, there was no provision made for the regular visitation and oversight of 
the schools, such at least, as is made in the contemplation of the present law. 
4th. In the States which have had most experience in the matter of public 
schools, either the principle of County Superintendence has been incorporated, 
and found to work well, or the want of it, or its equivalent, has become so appar- 
ent, that educators, district.directors and the people at large, are clamoring for 
it. 6, If you divide the work to be done, as was the case under the old system,
-P-A-G-E-297
CXLI 
you lose responsibility. If, by concentrating these duties in one office, you are 
forced to pay for their discharge, you secure responsibility, so that the blame of 
neglect may rest. on the proper person, and he may be punished. And 7th, The 
question of the salary of the County Superintendents, and the choice of the offi- 
wera, Which has had much influence, étc., after the Ist of March next, will rest 
with the body of School Directors, and they will be able to know and consider, 
both the mind of the people, and the wants of the schools. 
In this connection, it may not be amiss to say, that the 14 per cent. commis- 
sion on the woney passing through their hands, should not be reckoned a part of 
the salary of the County Superintendent, as the aggregate of it has been found 
not to be more than enough to pay for office rent, fuel, and such other expenses 
as will not be covered by appropriations by the County Court. 
In writing further of the wants of this system, as. developed by our: experience 
and observation, it will be convenient to furnish the history of our operations, 
1, There is a difficulty about taking the scholastic enumeration. In the thinly 
settled country districts there is comparatively little difficulty in having this 
work done, because the directors know their fleld so well that they can tell how 
many children they have in the district, without inquiring at every man’s door. 
In other districts, and the larger towns, the case is different. Much trouble and 
expense are here necessary. I suggest, therefore, that an allowance, from the 
fund due the district, of two cents for-every head enumerated, will pay for the 
work, and secure promptness. The enumerator should always be required to 
give the names of parents and guardians, and to post the list in some. public 
place, for general inspection. . 
Evil, in the shape of dissension and injustice, is apt to arise from a loose prac- 
tice, supposed to be common all over the State, Directors, on account of the 
pressure of other business, and sometimes from want of. interest in the public 
schools, manage the affairs of their districts without holding regular meetings, 
and keeping a record of their proceedings, sometimes indulging in the facile 
habit of committing everything to the management of one person. The law 
should declare all contracts, and opening of schools, and orders for pay to’ teach- 
ers, to be illegal, that are not part of the proceedings of a directors’ meeting. 
These meetings might be held by stated appointment, once a month, wherever 
a quorum is present. 
Qur experience teaches us that there should be no sub-district Boards of Di- 
rectors, The district may be sub-districted to define the range of certain schools 
but the Civil District is a small enough unit of organization.” When the Civil 
District is divided—the bounds too small already, must be divided accordingly. 
Poor schools are the result, or some sub-districts have none. In the end dissen- 
sion arises, and the whole enterprize becomes a clumsy failure.’ With some rea- 
sonable extent of territory, and some show of funds, a little more than ‘a drop in 
a bucket,’ the directors are encouraged ‘to magnify their office,’ and devise ‘lib- 
eral things,’ for the benefit of their people. 
Our greatest difficulty is owing to the want of funds, The apportionment 
from the State School Fund is scarcely half enough. The recent decision of the 
Supreme Court, that the law authorizing local taxation to be sanctioned by a 
vote of the people is unconstitutional, cuts us off from the most natural and easy 
resource. It is respectfully suggested that provision to meet this exigency might 
be made in the following manner: Let the Legislature pass a law---1st, requiring 
every District Board, once a year, to estimate the number, time and location of
-P-A-G-E-298
CXLIL 
the schools necessary to give the whole population a reasonable opportunity of 
having a public school for from five to seven months in the year, and the cost 
therevf. 2nd, Enlarging the powers of the Executive School Board of the coun- 
ty, so as to require a meeting, say four timos a year, at one of which the above 
mentioned estimates shall be submitted by the District Boards. 8d, Requiring 
the County Court, upon the recommendation of the ex-school board, to assess and 
order to be collected off the property and polls of the district the sum necessary 
to maintain such’ schools, after deducting the amount to be received from the 
State Treasury. This plan would have several things to recommend it. Ist, 
Xt would make the people more careful to elect persons suitable to be Directors 
of the Public Schools. 2nd, It would in like manner make the Clerks of the 
District boards more careful in the election of the most suitable “three of their 
own number to constitute the Executive School Board.” 8d, It would require 
the exercise of the power of taxation, by the authority, to which all admit, it 
was especially committed ‘for county purposes,’ by the Constitution. 4th, It is 
assunied that in this county, at least, there is so much zeal for education, that the 
people at large would rejoice in the adoption of a system which would give em- 
ployment to all good teachers; give permanence to the local schools, equalize the 
advantages of education, and lessen its burdens about one-half in the total cost 
thereof. 
The series of text-books for the public schools, recommended alike by the Con- 
vention of County Superintendents, has been partially adopted in this county. 
Care has been taken not to put parents to unnecessary expense in changing the 
books, and orders have been given to make the change where it could be done 
conveniently, Almost all the directors, teachers and parents, who have spoken 
at tuis office, on the subject, approve both of the plan and of the selection. Uni- 
formity is particularly called for in the county, where the schools have been 
changed often and where parents have frequently been shamefully imposed on 
by un unnecessary change of books. The objections to the change, or rather to 
the acto pt to secure uniformity, have generally come from parties iuterested in 
the sale of other series, or, from incompetent teachers, who kuow only their 
text-buoks, and are incapable of teaching ‘a subject.’ From the effort, as far as 
made in this county, and quite extensive observation of the evils of the other 
pian, L am decidedly of the opiniun, that we ought to persevere in this matter. 
In regard to the examination of teavhers, the majority of Directors and other 
persons who have spoken of that feature of the law, appear to be satisfied to have 
the examining power vested in the County Superintendent. Upon opening the 
office, u series of questions for examination was prepared, of which a copy ace 
companies this report. It was designed to take a middle course—that is, not to muke them too difficult, nor too easy. The examinations have ail been in wri- 
ting, and the exercises of the caudidates are on file in. the office. Whether i¢ 
would be better to examine publicly, on a set day and ina public place, at the courthouse, is a question not so clear as desirable. In # public examination, we 
would lose much of the modest and really worthy, and have too much of the bold and hard faced element. As experience has snowa that modést sensible fe- Tales in the majority of cases, make our best public school teachers, it does not feone visable to throw any obstacles in the way of their entering upon the pro- 
wwe wanPt bas been made to classify by’ any numerical method. of grading ers, the certificates, which have been issued from this office. The reason is,

As far as my observation goes, and the reports of directors and others throw 
light on the subject, there is goud reasun fur believing thet tbe majority of 
the teachers of this county are trying to do their duty honestly, They have 
struggled with difficulties and disappointments They suffer from poverty, oad 
in some eases from pinching want. They ure taunted for their confidence ls the 
system, and their faith in the honur and integrity of the State eenalled on all 
hands. Yet they have persevered, and amid these trials bravely completed thelr 
tasks. And then after their work is dyne, they have waited patisntly fur ibe 
zooney, and suffered for the want of it. This day, there are many whose bearte 
would be gluddened beyond expression, could the County Superintendent prompt-

fifty per cent. to the original amount, has enabled them again to resume opera-

The accounts of the office, which are all based upon a voucher similar to that 
used elsewhere in the public service, have ‘been examined and certified by the 
Ex-School Board of the county. They will show that there has been no holding 
back of the school funds here. On the contrary, authority has been stretched to 
its utmost limit, to meet the requirements of the public schools. The county su- 
perintendent did not receive any salary,.except the sum of $188, until eleven 
months after appointment, and he has used diligence in all known ways, to ob- 
tain money, and pay it over to the teachers. : 
Not only is the amount of money furnished for the support of the public schools 
inadequate, but the uncertainty as to the time of ‘payment has bzen the occasion of 
unutterable anxiety and distress. It is to be hoped that the Legislature will take 
prompt measures for settling this matter on a firm basis. It is impossible by any 
apologies, drawn from the financial embarrassment of the State, or from any other 
consideration, to satisfy the people who pay their taxes, on the assurance contained 
in a solemn law of the Legislature, that the proceeds shall be used for school purposes 
only, that itis right for the Comptroller, or Board of Finance, or the Legislature 
itseif to usé that money. for any other than that contained in the law which raised 
thefund. The people feel, that as the Legislature has the supreme power of taxa- 
tion, it should exercise its authority in such a manner as to maintain the sacred- 
ness of its own pledges; and that a failure to do so, is proof either of dishonesty, 
or incompetency. . 
A word ought to be said specially about the colored schools. “They were estab- 
lished in several places in this county, before any schools were started for the white 
population, under the school.law. Most of these schools were originally sustained 
by charitable associations at the North; and many thousands of dollars were ex- 
pended in their support. Since the restoration of civil authority, and regular 
action of the functio:.s of government, these schools have been brought under the 
provisions of the law, and sustained in whole or in part by the public funds, The 
white citizens have assisted the colored people to a greater or less extent in erecting 
buildings, which have done double service, beth for church and school. The bulk 
of the planning and labor, and in some cases of the funds, have come from the col- 
ored peuple themselves, and they should have the credit of the enterprize which 
they have manifested. In five or six instances in this county, the Bureau has ag= 
sisted in this work, and also to quite a considerable extent in sustaining thé teach+ 
ers of colored sebools. It is with regret, that Lam obliged to say, that although 
“the Greeks are at their doors,” the religious zeal of the hundreds of thousands of 
Christians in this region, has not yet prémpted them to enter this species of “mis- 
sionary service.” -In most cases therefore; it has been found necessary to employ 
as teachers, young men and women of color, who have as yet received only partial 
training for the business of teaching, in the first named schools Several ladies of 
respectability and character from the North, continue in this work; but in no in- 
stance, that has come tomy knowledge, have any of the white people, native of the 
State, undertaken the task. Nevertheless as before stated, there is a general ad- 
mission of the feasibility and desirableness of the education.of the colored race. 
Having now dwelt on the seyeral topics suggested by the attempt to inaugurate 
and sustain the public schools of Montgomery County, during the last two years, 
and feeling that I have drawn largely upon your patience, it remains only to addy

Robertson County, July 13th, 1869.—If I could have drawn the money

their schools were out, there would have been no difficulty at all in organizing the 
schools of the county. G. W. WALKER, Sup't, 
Rutherford County.—Mountains of prejudice have been overcome, and the 
way ina great’ measure prepared for a hearty co-operation of all the districts with 
thé friends of public schools. Great difficulty has been experienced in getting 
active, working directors to take hold of the school interes&. Nearly all of the 
teachers of this county have received a part of their salary from the people. The 
total amount paid in this manner is not stated. The enrollment and attendance, as 
usual, is much larger in the colored, than in the white schaols. The want of school- 
houses for the colored schools has delayed their opening, although three or four new 
houses built during the year, are reported. Schools of some kind have been estab- 
lished in every district in the county. An average of three schools to the district 
was expected to be in operation this fall. The Teachers’ Association was expected 
to be organized in the latter part of October. - W. H. WALLACE, Sup't. 
Sumner County,— Gallatin, Tenn; October Ist, 1869. 
Hon. Joun Earon, JR., Superintendent Public Instruction, Nashville, Tenn ;:— 
Sir :—I have the honor to submit the following report-of the condition of the 
Free Schools in my county, together with the enumeration of the scholastic popu- 
lation for the present year, . 
After the close of the 88 schoo!s opened prior to November 380th, 1868, and the 
payment of the teacher’s salaries for said session, a much greater interest was 
manifested by the people in general in the common:school system. The various ru- 
mors in circulation, in regard to there being no money in the Treasury, were thus 
proved to have been unfounded. The system had been tried and found to have 
been a good one in all of its main features. Many men who had denounced began 
to make inquiries in regard to the law; constant demands for copies of the law were 
made upon me, One of the results of this awakened interest was & complete or- 
ganization as to district and School District officers, and if money sufficient to pay 
a liberal: salary to teachers could be safely relied on, or some means provided for 
raising a sufficiency, no other change would be necessary to make the pfesent syse 
tem a complete success. 
At the present time there sre some fifty schools in session, and afew more to 
open, which Will probably increase the number of schools for the present year to 
fifty-five, an increase of seventeen over last year, witha much larger average at- 
tendance in proportion to the enrollment. There isa great scarcity of qualified 
teachers, The want of Normal Schools is seriously felt. I believe thata Normal 
School in each Congressional District, fostered by the State, would meet the wants —
-P-A-G-E-304

of the schools, and do more for the cause of education than almost any other step 
that could be taken, aside from the one to furnish means. 
-The cause of education among the colored population, notwithstanding the many 
drawbacks, is progressing. There are eight school buildings owngd by the Freed- 
unten. ‘Iwo others were destroyed by fire last year, besides there are several schools 
taught i in private houses. One colored school has closed (term completed). Two 
have been broken up, and five now in operation, with three more to open. ‘ 
- Although a much better condition of things exists than at any previous time, 
yet much more remains to be done to complete the work. If no serious change is 
made in the law, except to add to its efficiency, we shall confidently expect a result 
that will satisfy the warmest friends of education. 
Tam very respectfully, your obedient servant, 
: H. C. McQUIDDY, Sup’t. ry 
Smith County, November 30, 1868—I am succeeding far beyond my high- 
est expectations, As yet, there is but one colored school. The great difficulty in 
the case is the disposigion of the blacks to’ make frequent Bhifts of residence. Nev~ 
ertheless, I expect another colored school shortly. 
September 16th, 1869.—At this date we have a number of colored schools in.op- 
eration; but it has cost a deal of: work and pains to get them. 
IRA W. KING, Sup’t, 
Stewart ‘County, December 5, 1869.—At present, most people in Stewart 
County Jook upon the free school system as an “abolition” plan of educating the 
blacks only; hence they are slow to take hold to do anything towards organizing 
the county under the school law. I get prontises to act; and weeks afterward find 
nothing done. I have visited every Civil District and almost every sub-District in 
the county. . 
May -8, 1869.—At last we are doing something in the way of public schools. 
Nine are now taught, and more will shortly-be opened. Of those in operation, two 
are colored. Many more schools would be opened, if only the people had any con- 
fidence, or ground of confidence, that the State officers at Nashville controlling the 
public funds would obey the school law and let us have our school money when the 
Jaw meant we should have it. 
September 8, 1869.—Last year there were two schools taught five months each; 
this year nine of five months each, and 24 sre now reported in operation. The 
County Court refuses to pay for the blanks, records, etc,, necessary in my office, 
B. @. ALDEN, Sup’t. 
Wan Buren County, March 8, 1869.--The schools of the county are now 
closed, having given generel satisfaction, The District Clerks are so careless and 
remiss in making out their reports to me, that my report to you is delayed badly. 
* * * # Another year of trial will make the free school system. a complete 
success, E. E, RODGERS, Supt. 
Warren County, January 12, 1869.---Reports are going abont that our county 
will draw no money. If this tale be true, the sooner it is known the better for all . 
of us. Most of our teachers are men of small means; and if, after teaching five 
months, they get nb pay, their families must suffer. 
Fuly 26th, 1869, ---The teachers of this county have had no pay except the ap- 
portionmens of 1866; that of 1867 is now due to them, and over due. I have in my
-P-A-G-E-305

hands the ‘Comptroller’s warrants for this money of 67; but as he has forbidden 
the Revenue Collector of the county to cash them, they are uselegs to us here. I 
will forward them. This action of the Comptroller is a severe blow to our schools. 
It has utterly crushed all confidence, and utterly destreyed all interest. Not a 
teacher will undertake a free school again, so long as the arbitrary and unlawful 
order of a State officer can rob him of his hard-earned pay. 
August 81st, 1869.---Necessity of more interest in Hducation,--The census of 1850 
gives the white female population of Warren county, over ten years of age, 2,858. It 
also gives the adult white females who cannot read and write, 1,004, which is more 
than one-third of the white females in the county, who are over ten years of age. 
Other counties inthe State exhjbit a still greater proportion of illiterate white fe- 
males: In my visits around the county, I heard of one woman that said to her 
neighbor who was sending to a free school, and using her influence to get others to 
send, ‘If F ketch one of my gals with a book in her hand, [ll slap her over, Me and 
my old man haini got no larnin, and I don't want the gals to have none.” With these 
facts before us, there are men in this county, who say, “Abandon your free school 
system, repeal all your free school laws, take the school fund which is now on 
hand, to aid in paying the State debt, and leave the cause of education entirely to 
private enterprise,” I am opposed to such a measure, and I believe that, if the sys- 
tem is abandoned, in fourteen years w majority of those in Warren County, who 
are now of scholastic age, over 6 and under 20, will not be able to write their 
names, 
The State needs a more efficient ‘system of free schools. People are beginning 
to see that all classes should learn to read. Some men, owning fine property, and 
living in the country, reason with themselves in this way. “Though we are able to 
educate our own children by sending them away from home to school, yet, they 
will asgociate more or less with our neighbors’ children; hence, it is an advantage 
to us that our neighbors’ children should be educated, and should be raised with 
some refinement and culture;” and when the free school system is fairly in opera- 
tion, they will pay their school tax as willingly as they pay any other tax for the 
support of the government. Again, there are many people im this county who are 
taking no paper. Their excuse is, they live so far from any post-office, that a paper” 
is of no.service to'them. Now, if all their neighbors could read and write, morr 
postoffices would soon be established. Some men in this county are living eight 
miles from: any place where they can receive their papers by mail.. 
School-houses.---In visiting 40.schools in the county, I found that not more than 
ten were taught in houses that were suitable for the purpose for which they were 
used, In fact, many of them are miserable structures, not so good as many stables 
would be, if they were cleansed, and furnished with a few seats and windows.

Wayne County,--- 
White County, June 28, 1869. The people are generally in favor of the

Williamson County, March 81st, 1869.--Our people's dislike of free

January 4, 1869.---Our Quarterly Court convened-to-day. Upon examination, it 
: was found that the county owed the school fund $2,200. They instruct the Judge 
to issue ® warrant on the County Trustee for that amount. * * * More inter 
- est is shown to-day in the cause of education, than ever before in Williamson 
county. * * ® On Friday night 800 masked men rode through the village of 
Franklin, yelling like demons. Mr. Gray, a director in the 4th District, (where 
they had given notice that the less done about negro schools, the better), let it be 
known that he wanted to talk with them. They rode to his house, and after quite a 
Jong parley, consented to let the negro school go on without disturbance, provided 
it was managed and controlled by white men. J. A. EDMONSON, Sup’t. 
Wilson County, January 6, 1869,---Nearly all the rich and influential people 
of Wilson County dislike the free school system violently. The District Directors 
the county through, are unwilling to lifta hand towards starting the schools, until 
they can know exactly how much school money will be coming to us, and when it 
will be paid. I have tried hard to get them to hire teachers at a certain definite 
rate a month; and then, whatever the public money lacks of paying them in full, 
make up to them by voluntary contribution from those benefitted, or by local tax’ 
Astoa » tax, all the directors believe it would work very badly at present. 
N. G. ALEXANDER, Sup’t 
III. WEST TENNESSEE. 
Benton County, January 5, 1869—Owing to the opposition heretofore 
existing, several schools that had opened, were closed again when it was found 
the school money was not to be had when due by the law. Funds having at last 
been received, some of these schools want to open again and teach, out the 5 
months’ session. Can they receive their share of school money, if this be 
doue? ‘ 
, April 13, 1869.-Civil Districts 1, 3, 7 and 11, are as yet destitute of free schools. 
The school money had’nt come, and the Directors did’nt believe it would come. 
So they were unwilling to hire teachers. Confidence being at last gained, they 
are now anxious to have the schools begin; but jing by their former neg- 
lect, forfeited the apportionment of 1866, they are still somewhat sore. Can't 
something be done to recover that forfeited money of 1866? 
July 26, 1869.—Am glad to say that.after all the opposition we have had to 
work against and fight against, the general sentiment of this (Benton County) is 
quite decidedly in favor of our excellent free school system, and the cause of edu- 
cation is getting on finely with us, GEORGE HOLLOWELL, Sup’t. 
Carroll County, February 5, 1868.—The project for a graded free school 
in Bethel College, is at last successful. Next Monday the school will open with 
3 teachers, To carry it on, we must raise $500 by local taxation; and we want 
to get as much from the Peabody Fund, if wecan. At McKenzie, where there 
are no legal voters, I appointed District Directors, and organized a school. They 
are taking hold of the work with spirit and interest. Also, at the same place, I 
started a subscription school for colored pupils, which will, after a while, be turned 
into a free school, but not just yet. Public opinion will not yet admit the thing. 
March 26, 1868.—Al] our Civil Districts, except 2 or 3, are now organized for 
free school purposes. These2 or 3 failures are caused by the rumors that thé

system is a failure. * * * * The people, generally, prefer to 
have the school year begin on or near the 1st of July. 
February 28, 1869.—Have just learned of that most astonishing decision of 
the Supreme Court, declaring that a district may not levy a tax upon itself for 
school purposes. Three weeks ago we opened our graded school with 3 teachers 
and 50 or more scholars, If the measles had not been raging badly all through 
the neighborhood, the attendance would be at least twice as large. One week 
ago, in conformity with the provisions of the law, we held an election and voted 
atax. The vote was very small. Some men had been very noisy, and their 
bravado and bluster kept considerable numbers away from the polls. Now, then, 
does this decision of the Supreme Court touch our case? If it does, is there 
any help for us? Must we lose all we've gained? 
March 15, 1869.—It being now unconstitutional for us to tax ourselves for our 
own good in the matter of schools, I must try to raise $500 by subscription in 
behalf. of our graded school heretofore spoken of. Hope that won't be unconsti- 
tutional! We shall also try to’ get help from the Peabody Fund Few places 
need it more than McLemoresville. Am sometimes fairly appalled ai the 
amount and intensity of ignorance inthis county. 
August 2, 1869.—I have not been able to get a single dollar upon the warrants 
issued to me last May. Have written to the Comptroller, but get no answer. 
Teachers are getting very restive under this delay of paymient 0 of their hard 
earned wages. 
September 18, 1868.— When I go to Huntingdon on a public day, I am at once 
beset’ by numbers of poor teachers whose pay has been due from one to ten 
months. I have been giving promises till E am tired of chat. I am now forced 
to tell them that the State officials are not acting in good faith towards them. 
October 7, 1869.—It is now very hard to get our district boards to act. All 
confidence is destroyed by the failure to pay over school moneys when dae. You 
can scarcely conceive of the mischief done by this bad management of school 
moneys. J. L. McDOWELL, Sup’t. 
Dyer Gounty.—Our péople are now getting to see and understand the free 
school system in its true light. Our schools are successful—our teachers are 
pleased—the children are taught—and the prejudices against free schools, (which 
12 months ago caused me to be insulted,)} are now giving way. There are only 8 
pay schools now in Dyer; and Newbern Academy, the only one in the county, has 
just organized itself asa graded free school. 
J. B. CUNNINGHAM, Sup ¢. 
Gibson County, October 4, 1869.—Our people have become so despondent 
in regard to the schools, they now care little for them, Some districts will not 
take the scholastic census. = * * —# No one expects another cent from 
the school money to be distributed to the counties. Every day I hear men con- 
demn the whole system, and express the hope that it may be abolished. They 
hate the schools and free education simply and solely because it provides educa- 
tion for colored children. W. H. STILLWELL, Sup’t. 
Hardiman County, June 3, 1869.—After considerable exertions, I have 
induced the directors to open schools in nearly every Civil District in the county.
-P-A-G-E-308

and some districts are fully under way. The colored people are so scattered 
that it is hard to get enough together; and the freedmen don’t exhibit so much 
zeal as they ought. I got a colored school started here, and although we have 
118 colored school children in ‘the district, and nearly all within attending dis- 
tance, yet but 18 have attended yet. - 
Lam getting the scholastic returns in very fast; but could do nothing until I 
i.saed a circular, (a copy I enclose you.) 
Please say to me the prospect of the teachers getting their pay for teaching 
the schools. - Would there be any probability of making an arrangement to get 
our own money from our tax collector, as he eollects it? I would like it. It 
would save much red tape. 
‘September 18, 1869.—I1 enclose receipts for State Warrants; but now my trou- 
ble begins, I find that our collectors are notified by Mr. Blackburn not to have 
anything to do with our Warrants, but to take nothing but money, and send it 
to him. I think this extremely hard, as this county paid for schools,

Lauderdale County.---This is the only county in Tennessee which had 
not organized free schools before October 1, 1869. 
September 18,'1869.--The canse of the people's education in this county is in 
a most lamentably backward state. Not a single free school has yet been taught

Madison County, September 8, 1869 ---Here in our county, the interest in 
free schools is growing fast, as they become better known; and confidence in the 
system is getting to be felt, as the school money comes to us from the State Trea- 
sury. All will goon well and satisfactorily if the incoming Legislatare will 
ony act wisely, and “let well enough alone.” D. RB. J. WILLIAMS, Sup't.

Gen. Joun Eaton, Js., State Superintendent Public Instruction :---Sir :--I have 
.. the honor to submit the following. report of the free schools of Shelby County 
while under my charge as Superintendent: 
T received my commission on February fifteenth, 1869, and proceeded at once 
tO quality and to enter upon the duties of my office, I found that .my able pre- 
decessor, Rev. W. H. Pearne, had, by hard work, secured the scholastic popula- 
tion of all the civil districts in the county, and had successfully organized schools 
in eight of the seventeen civil districts outside of the City of Memphis. In sev- 
eral of them, however, noschool directors had been elected or appointed. The
-P-A-G-E-309
‘CLIT 
greatest difficulty had been encountered in obtaining any persons willing to serve 
in that capacity, and far more in finding such as would ‘perform zealously and 
intelligently the duties assigned to them by the schoollaw. Had it not been for 
the provision of the law empowering the Superintendent to appoint where, 
through apathy and indifference, if not outright hostility to free schools, the elec- 
tion of directors was had, the organization of the county’ would have been im- 
possible. Every civil district is now completely organized with Boards of Di- 
rectors. . 
For the most part, the difficulty in securing good -citizens to act as such, has 
now happily passed away. The mass of these officers are now earnestly endea- 
voring to discharge their duties with fidelity and to the public advantage. 
Only a very few are stumbling blocks, instead of helps, in the efficient estab- 
lishmest of free schools. Some are deserving of the highest praise for their de- 
votion and energy thanifested in furthering this important interest. 
Of the last, without invidious discrimination, I may mention Capt. A. B. 
Haynes, F. C. Stephenson, Dr. Edward Irby,‘and J. W. Vernon, Dr. A. Row- 
lett and Rev. I. N. Shepherd. A great difficulty to be overcome, was the utter 
destitution of school-houses in nearly al] the districts This has compelled a 
resort to every make-shift, for temporary purposes. In one instance, a colored 
school was organized in a shady grove, and there successfully taught until a 
building was secured. The want of central location in the matter of school- 
houses, has greatly inconvenienced sections of districts, which have justly com- 
plained of the inequality of educational facilities. . 
The increasing interest in free schools has enabled public-spirited citizens, by 
the donation of lands, to secure the erection ofa considerable number of fair 
buildings in the county. ‘The prospect in this respect is now very encouraging. | 
Free schools have now been opened in every civil district. of the county. The 
oppesition to any part of the system at first encountered, has changed into a 
hearty welcome of schools even for colored children. The teachers have gener- 
ally acquitted themselves very fairly; and, in some instances, have achieved 
marked success, Of the latter, Messrs. Davie Laughlin, R. B. Mumford, J. P. 
Clark, G. M. Curtis, George Locke, J. M. Gragg, Misses M. E. Palm, Mattie Ro- 
pinson, and Mrs. 1. N. Shepherd, are deserving of honorable mention. 
The difficulty in securing teachers for the first schools was so great that none 
could be had, except for the highest salaries. This.necessitated too tew schools 
for the accomodation of all the children in the several districts. Upon entering 
upon the discharge of the duties of this supervision, I caused a general reduction 
of teachers’ salaries, of fully forty per cent. In this way, I have been enabled 
to furnish » larger number of schools to each district, and the fund has thereby 
been more fairly distributed; but the want of school-houses, in proper locations, 
still prevents the full realization of my aims in-this direction. Notwithstanding 
the reduction of salaries, the number of applications for positions as teachers, has 
shown a steady increase, and their,qualifications a similar improvement. There 
could be no more gratifying indication of the growth of the popular confidence 
in the free school system. Many teachers had taught private schools with suc- 
cess, in the same localities in which they were engaged in thé public schools, [ 
have always given the preference to such teachers, when found possessed ef the 
proper qualifications. I have endeavored, in all cases, to secure the best teach- 
ers at my command. co 
In con ducting examinations for certificates, both oral and written answers have
-P-A-G-E-310
cLIV ‘ 
been required, At first, there was the greatest confusion in text-books; and, in 
consequence, the number of classes in the” schools are most absurdly and incon- 
veniently multiplied. The adoption ofa uniform series of books has lessened, 
the number of classes, enabled the teachers to instruct each more fully and thor- 
oughly, and added largely to the general efficiency of the schools. 
While all ‘has not been accomplished in the county which could have been 
desired, I have the gratification to be able to report at the close of this, the 
second year of the operation of the free school law in the State, that, notwith- 
standing the various obstacles and discouragements met with, every civil district 
has been properly organized with boards of directors: that school-houses have 
been built, or are being projected, in every district; that in‘every district free 
schools have been opened; that, in fact, some ninety are now in progress, and 
that while the free school system was at first looked upon askance, as a most odi- 
ous measure, it is now everywhere recognized as a popular necessity, 
For the report of the scholastic population of the county, the attendance upon 
the schools, and the cost of instruction, I refer you to the accompanying statis- 
tics, _ Very respectfully, etc., 
H. BE. ANDREWS, 
Sup't Schools of Shelby County. 
Weakley County, December 5th, 1868—Most of the directors in this 
county shake their leads when I talk to them about colored schools, and say this- 
isnot the time for’such schools. Others are willing to do all they can in further 
ance of such schools, but are afraid of public opinion. 
Decerhber 11th, 1868.—-Reports come in from the district clerks very slowly; 
and it is only by going. to them in person that I can get any reports at all. 
July 19th, 1869.—The colored school, at Dresden, is in fine condition, number- 
ing more than fifty pupils. The prospect for free schools, white and colored, is 
now quite promising, 
September 6th, 1869.--Last Thursday night the teachers of the colored school 
at Dresden, were forced from their boarding-house by armed and disg ised men 
dragged tothe woods; severely whipped with withes; forbidden, under pain of death, 
to teach colored people any longer in this county; and ordered to leave immedi- 
ately. Both these teachers were colored young men, of good education, excellent 
morals and manners, and uncommonly skillful and successful as teachers.

Our county does not improve very fast.. It was but the 24th of August, (just 
gone,) that a colored man was taken from. jail, at Dresden, by maskéd men, and 
hanged. He was charged with committing an outrage upon a white woman; but 
it is now nearly certain that Ae was wholly innocent, and another colored man is 
under arrest as being the guilty one. A. M. HUGHES, Sup’t.

Extract from an Address delivered before the State Teachers’ Association at Lookouy 
Moyntain, August 9th, 1869, by Hon. Wm. Bosson, President of the Association 
‘The educatiorial statistios of 1870, it is believed, will show that thie importan 
nierest has kept pace with the growth of the country, in population, wealth and 
prosperity. And it may be further said, that while in the Southern States educa-
-P-A-G-E-311
CLV 
tional support and energy was suspended generally for a period of six years, that 
so wise and successful have been the agencies created to promote systems of pop- 
ular education, that in all those States a great advance will have been made, and 
that the censys of 1870 will disclose the interesting fact, that more thorough sys- 
tems of free school education haye taken the place of the inefficient ones of the 
past, and that there is a wonderful increase in the scholastic population and the effi- 
ciency of the new system. 
We are justified in this conclusion from the knowledge we possess, that in the re- 
modeling the constitutions of the States, there has been in every instance, mani. 
fested a wise sagacity in providing by constitutional and statutory law, enlight- 
ened systems of publio instruction, inspired by and adapted to the new birth of the 
States, in the change in relations of inhabitants. 
Alabama, in November, 1867, revised its constitution, and gave in charge all its 
educational interests to a Board of Education, with full legislative powers in refer. 
ence to public educational institutions; and it is made the duty of the Board to 
establish, throughout the State, in each township, common free schools to educate 
all the children of the State, without-distinction ; and besides other large revenues, 
the constitution deyotes exclusively one-fifth of the annual aggregate revenue of 
the State to the maintenance of public free schools. 
Arkansas, by her remodeled constitution, adopted March, 1868, established a free 
common school system for all, without dis‘inction of color; and in addition to the 
interest on its school assets, assessed a tax of one dollar, on every male inhabitant, 
for the support of its free schools, to be kept not less than three months in the, year 
im each district, and authorizes and requires the Legislature to provide the means 
therefor, and for the purpose of building and furnishing @ sufficient number of suit- 
able school-houses, and furnishing the same for the accommodation of all the pu. 
pils. Itis also provided, that the General Assembly shall, bylaw, require every child of 
sufficient mental and physical abilility, to attend the the public schools. 
Florida adopted its new constitution February 7, 1868, which provided for free 
common school instruction to all children, “without distinction or preference.’ 
Each county is required to raise annually by tax, not less than one-half appropri_ 
ated by the State, to maintain in each precinct a school for three months. 
Georgia, the 11th of May, 1868, adopted » new constitution, which provided for 
athorough system of general education, free to all children of the State, and re- 
quires a tax to be assessed on persons and property, equal to the cost of instruction, 
Louisiana, by constitutional provision, adopted March 9, 1869, requires that there 
shall be éstablished in-every parish, one free public school, aud provides the means 
of their support, and prohibits separate schools, or institutions of learning “estab- 
lished exclusively for any race, by the State of Louisiana.” 
Mississippi, January 1868, formed a new constitution, which roquires a four 
months free school to be kept in each school district, annually; assesses an annua, 
poll tax of three dollars, and otherwise provides the means for the support of the 
schools, without distinction as to race.~ 
North Carolina, by her constitution adopted April, 1868, provides for a general 
and uniform system of public instruction, and requires that there shall be kept a 
four months school. The General Assembly is required to enact, by law, thate very 
child of sufficient mental and physical ability shall attend the public schools, during 
the period between 6 and 18 years, for a term of not less than 16 months. 
South Carolina adopted her new constitution March, 1868. It provides for a 
uniform system of free sch 4, for the period annually of 6 months, without dis-
-P-A-G-E-312
CLVI 
tinction of race, and makes it the duty of the Legislature to provide for compulsory 
atiendance of all children of scholastic age, for a term equivalent to 24-months in eight 
years, and to appropriate an afount equal to the support of the schools. 
Virginia formed her constitution December, 1867, which establishes a system of 
public free schools, requires their free, introduction into all the couyties of the State 
by the year 1876, .and provides that the Legislature shall make such laws as shall 
not permit parents and guardians to allow their children to grow up in vagrancy and ig- 
norance, . 
This exhibit affords testimony conclusive of the progressive setiment incorpora- 
ted into the new constitutions of the States, so much in advance of those they have 
superceded, and which will vitalize the cause and efficiency of education, and 
highly promote intelligence and virtue. . 
Extract from an address by Rev. T. H. Prarye, D.D., before the State Teachers’ 
Association, at Memphis, January Ist, 1869: 
“Prast.—Edueation tends to the elevation of the people, and thus to prevent and diminish 
pauperism and crime. 
Sxoonp.—Education tends, as we have already seen, to promote industry, which is a double 
benefit to society; and, therefore, the State is under obligations to provide means for its ac- 
quisition. . ~ . 
Turrp.—But industry, as growing out of education, tends to increase the material wealth 
and prosperity of the State. 
It does‘thus, directly, because industry is a producer. It converts the minerals 
of the earth into implements of useful labor. It adapts the crops to the soil, and 
yields more enriching returns to-husbandry. It renders the air, and water, and 
rain, and snow, and lightning, subservient to human enrichment It propels 
the spindle, loom, reaper, plow, mower, thresher; the forge, the foundry, the roll- 
ing mill, the steamboat, the locomotive, and the printing press; so multiplying 
the products of human labor manifold, and filling the coffers of the individual, 
and the State with its never diminishing, ever receiving, revenues. Place an ed- 
ucated community in a sterile country, amid bleak rocks and barren ‘mount- 
ains, where the seasons are rigorous, and the elements unkind; where everything 
produced must be wrung from the soil by severe application and stern endeavor. 
Place an ignorant people in a fertile region, where the soil is prolific and the 
seasons are genial; where growths are spontaneous, and fruits to sustain life need 
no culture, At the end of five years, the former will be rich, thriving, prosper- 
ous, happy and cultivated; while the latter will be poor, squalid and miserable. 
Indirectly, by awakening the mind to an inventive power, which produces 
lebor-saving machines, education enriches the State. An ignorant man, who 
will plow for me for a dollar a day, earns his money well; but aman who can 
apply machinery to the same work, and can do the labor of ten men or twenty, 
is worth to me, or to the State, ten or twenty times as much. 
The man whose inventive genius is quickened by education to discover modes 
of applying machinery to the production of wealth, is worth more to the State 
than a regiment of clod-hoppers, whose only skill is that of uninstructed labor. 
And, also, and especially education, by enlarging and stimulating the powers of 
the mind ‘to discover mew sources of wealth, and the best means of accumulating 
it, is promotive of the material prosperity of the State.
-P-A-G-E-313
CLVIE 
That State is far advanced in the scale of progress and wealth, where the hum- 
blest citizen can convert the various forms of matter around him into objects of 
utility, beauty, or power; who can convert the slate and marble, flint and gran- 
ite, and various ores; the grasses. ‘and trees; the creeks and rivers; the swamps 
and the hills, into wealth, comfort, and means of culture. How easy to make the 
comparison, and draw the conclusion. 
Here is a child of poor parents, who, without education, will grow up to be a 
non-producer, indolent, unthrifty, dishonest, a yagrant, or a criminal. We will 
suppose he grows up and remains in the same community where born, to be- 
come a pauper—and this is the mildest form to'put it,—for his support alone he 
will cost the county or State more in one yeur than would have educated him in 
the common schools; and so, probably, have prevented him from becoming a pub- 
lic charge. But suppose for a lack of education he becomes a criminal; disturbs 
the public peace, and costs the county or the State hundreds of dollars to convict 
and punish him, how much cheaper for the State to have educated him? 
On the contrary, suppose the taxes to educate that same boy would have 
cost the people of his district a few cents or dimes, for five or ten years,and he 
becomes thereby an inventor of machinery, or a discoverer of the secrets of na- 
ture, enriching the State and the world by millions of dollars, how wonderfully 
strong the argument in favor of popular education ! 
On principles purely commercial, as a simple question of loss or gain, it is 
cheaper for the State to educate the children than not to do it. 
Wecan better afford to build school-houses than jails: to pay school teachers 
than constables and sheriffs; to tax the citizen to educate, rather than to tax the 
citizen to support paupers or punish crime. Asa simple question of dollars and 
cents in the matter of cost, education is cheaper than any other protection, 
But the question may arise—has the State the right; the power to provide edu- 
cation for the children? Because, if it has not, then the argument as to the obli- 
"gation of the State fails. For, however desirable or important it may be for the 
people to be educated, if the State lacks the right or the power to do it, the obliga 
tion does not exist. No man or corporation is under obligation to do what it can- 
not do. But I maintain the State has plenary power in thé premises, All our 
ideas of the nature of civil government chrystalize into this form: all rightful 
governments derive their just powers from the consent of the people governed. 
With this as & basis, the conclusion is irresistible, that the State has the power to 
establish common schools, if the people so will. The difficulty, then, is not in the 
State, but with the people. 
But let us analyze the nature and powers of a State, What are they ? Clearly 
to maintain the rights and preserve the interests of the people. With this para- 
mount idea of the design and object of the government, it is easy to sustain our 
position as to the duty of the State to educate its citizens. Looking to the great 
cardinal object ofall good government—the conservation of public order and per¢ 
sonal welfare—the State has a right to do for itself, and for the promotion of this 
object, whatever is necessary for its safety, permanence, prosperity and efficiency, 
just as an individual has. No one doubts the right of the State to provide against 
infectious or contagious diseases. But no disease is so deadly to the State or na- 
tional welfare, as popular ignorance. Certainly, then, the State has a right to 
guard against this, by providing and fostering its antidote—Education, 
The State is under obligation to maintain the rights of the citizen against any 
who would, by force or by fraud, deprive him of them, 
 
-P-A-G-E-314
cLYIIT 
But popular ignorance will not only sap the rights of those who are themselves 
ignorant; it will endanger the liberties of all the other citizens as well. There- 
fore, the State has aright to prevent this, by providing the means of education. 
The State has a right to punish crime, For this, our courts are established ; for 
this, our jails are erected, and our constables and sheriffs elected; for this, we are 
taxed, and we submit to be taxed. : 
All admit the right of the State to punish crime; logically, the right to prevent 
crime, when it can be done without restraining, violently or unlawfully, the liber- 
ty of the citizen, is equally irresistible. 
Education is a sure preventive of crime and its results, and it can be popularisep 
without invading the rights of any; therefore the right of the State to Promote 
it, is unquestionabdle. 
  
Extract From the Address of Hon. N, A. Patterson 
Before the State Teachers’ Association, on Things Necessary to the Success of he 
Common School System in Tennessee. 
DELIVBRAD avaust 19TH, 1869, 
‘He dwelt especiaily upon the fact, that two ‘‘things” are necessary to the success apecially de- 
aired, and they are both large, highly important and indispensible. First, a large measure of ad- 
ministrative and excoutiye ability; and, second, @ large amount of money—genuine dollars and 
cents, The work to be performed is a large one, most vitally important, involving the largest in- 
terest of the country, and cannot be performed with limited effort and little means. 
‘Without entering into particulars, Jet me say that the important item of preliminary labor in 
the promotion of our common school system by our State Superintendent, Gen. Eaton, and the 
officers acting under hia appointment and direction, throughout the State, has been most extraor- 
dinary, and clothed with, may say, unexpected and unparalleled success. In expressing my 
opinion and estimate of this-prelirninary work, I presume I cannot be suspected of the design of 
B mero compliment. I speak from the official reports and my observations of a portion of the field 
of labors ; and Lam glad of the opportunity thus to pay a deserved tribute to a class of earnest, 
honest and efficient officers—officers who, from the Superintendent-in-chief down, have performed 
amore arduous labor, physical.and mental, attended with better results, and for which they have 
received less in the way of salaries, than any class of officials heretofore known in the history of 
our State, In fact, their labor has been almost gratuitous, Perhaps no County Superintendent 
has performed Jess labor, and in most cases greater by far, than the Governor of the State. 
The'grand total for tho State exhibits as the result pf twenty-two end a half months’ labor, 
the opening of 2431 schools, employing 2462 teachers, and giving free instruction to 135,732 pu- 
Pils, The exhibit shows a cost to the State of instruction to each student, for a session of five 
months, of only $3.59, whilst the lowest average expense for such session in other institutions is 
not less than $10.95. Bear in mind, if you please, too, that this work—this great success—is but 
the preliminary work, All the disadvantages of organization and_ initiation had to be contended 
with. Now, that the work has beer so favorably commenced, its progress under the management 
of the same heads and hands would be a still higher success. So I conclude that oneof the rn1nas 
NxEcEssARyY is, or would be if possible, a continuance of these efficient public: servants in office, 
‘The question is, can such be hoped for? Or, ia it possible that so efficient and good a class of men 
can be found to fill their places? 
I regret exceedingly that politicians, under a gross misapprehension of the facts, have thought 
it necessary not only to assail our common school system, but the efficient Superintendents who 
have labored so earnestly and efficiently to inaugurate it uader the law. 
After coreful inquiry, Ihave yet to hear of any authentic proof of the charges so recklessly 
made against Superintendents. All tnoneys provo to have been faithfully applied under the law, resulting, as stated, most favorably to the special interests of the country. When the whole field 
of action shall have been carefully scanned and well understood, the verdict presented by an ap 
preciative public sentiment will be, ‘Well done, good and faithful servants,’* 
am gratified to know that so full a measure of earnest administrative and executive ability has been employed, The necessity is for its continuance and increase,
-P-A-G-E-315

The ather rune needed is a large amount of material resources—dollars and cents. This has 
been and is lacking; and ought to be supplied. It is a mistake of overgrewn proportions that 
money appropriated by a State, the Government, or an individual, for the purposes of education is 
an investment without adequate return. It is better than stock invested in first-class bank or 
railroad incorporations, And why? Because, in adding to the value of the citizen, as a man or 
woman, it adds a high current value to the Government or State. 
It is said that every man has his price, That is, that he can be bought for a fixed price. How- 
ever that may be, Lam safe in asserting-that every man and woman in the country has a fixed 
definite value; and its grade depends upon the measure of scientific, literary aud practical knowl- 
edge possessed or acquired. The man or woman without educated training is, as 2 machine, fixed 
at alow nominal value. Worth to him or herself and to others, a few dollars, perhaps not ex+ 
ceeding one hundred per annum; but ono with high practical educated training is worth even 
thousands of dollars per annura. To possess this high value is, of course, worth a liberal outlay. 
If you buy a good house, a tract of highly productive soil, or a valuable piece of merchandise, 
you expect to pay e full and round price; and you do so, readily ; even so, to secure # high and 
efficient system of education requires a liberal bestowal of dollara and cents; and even then, I assure you, the bargain is a good one. Did you ever note the fact that the cheapest articles of apparel for the body, from head to foot, are those that cost a round price? And that the dearest articles are those commonly called cheap ones ? °

In the High Schools, there throo classes, called, respectively, Junior Middle and Senior. The time de- yoted 10 the studies of each grade and class, is generally one year, so that a pupil that enters the first grade, at the age of six years, and passes all the examinations for promotion to higher grades, will graduate at the High School, at the age of 17 years. When practicable, the pupils in cach grade are divided into three classes—-those of nearly equal scholarship being putin the same class, Sometimes the pupils in tho first, or highest class, pass over two grades in one year, An cffort is always made to have the grading so close that the progress of pupils of good capaci. ty, is not retarded by those having dull and sluggish intellects, Examinations.—At the end of cach school month, there are written and oral examinations of all the grades, In the higher grades, the examinations are, for the most part, written. At the end of each school yaar, there ure examinationa for determining the grades of the pupils for the following year. In the different schools, the pupils of the samo grado, have the same questions submitted to them, so that theschools may be compared with each other in the matter of scholar- ship. Aftor the examination papers have been carefully overlooked, and the percentage uf cach determined, the proper classification for the next year can be ascertained. Course of Study.—By r-ference to the Cours® of Study, it may be seen that the standard of scholarship in these schools, is us high as that fixed for the schools of much older cities, in which systems of public schools have been in.operation for many yesrs. Pupils are not advanced in grade, unless they pass a creditable examination on the studies of the grade to which they belong. in this matter, no favoritiem is shown toany one. The rich and the poor ate judged by precise.

the same rules. In the lower grades, pupils are required to answer 80 per cent. of the ques- 
tions proposed for examination, as a condition of “passing grade.” In the different schools, these 
questions are the same for like grades.

SEVENTH AND HIGHTH GRADES. 
In these grades, the subjects of study in the preceding grades are completed, and the pupil is prepared for entering the High School. P & ern : pievew pup High Schools.—-Inasmuch as the schools have been in operation but for a short time, and as all pupils are requird to pass fair examinations for promotion to higher grades and cusses, the num- ber in attendance at the High School, is small. The number enrolled during the past year, was 113, and of this number about 60 belonged to tho Eighth Grade of the Grammar achouls. Tho pupils of this grade are, for the ‘present, taught by the teachers of the High School. At the close of the last scholastic year, there was ‘a graduating class ,of six. In the opinion of competent and disinterested judges, the members of this class acquitted themselves at the closing exercises of the school, with much credit. Their examination. papers, now on file in the Superin: tendent,s oltice, establish their scholarship beyond all question. At presont, (October, 1869,) the graduating class numbers 13 pupils, Colored Schools.—The pupiis in these schools, are also making commendable progress. Most of the pupils in these schools, belong to the lower grades. Nearly all of them are found in the first four grades, There is a small class in the Fifth Grade.

OLXXXXIII 
COMMUNICATION .FROM THE COMPTROLLER. 
Geverat Joun Earoy, Jn., Srate SuparinrenpEnT Common ScHooLs :— 
Dear Sir :--Your communication of the 27th ult., calling my attention to 
certain resolutions adopted by the Board of School Fund Conimissioners, was re- 
ceived long since. My failure to reply sooner, was caused partly by the fact that 
this office is unable to impart the information asked for by the resolutions, and 
partly on account of the fact that a continued press of business in my hands, has 
caused me to forget your communication. 
This office is not the custodian of the Schoo] Fund, and officially, cannot and 
does not know any thing abont it, further than-—as an impracticable law di- 
rects—make a statement to the State Superintendent of Common Schools, annually 
of the amount of money paid into the State Treasury by the tax-payers of the 
State, for school purposes, as provided by the Revenue Laws of the State. 
This annual statement, required to be made by the Comptroller, is simply the tax 
on property and polls, for & given year, and other taxes for the same year. It 
follows necessarily, therefore, that the Comptroller can not state the amount 
afforded for schools by our school tax laws, until the Tax Collectors close their ac- 
counts for that year——I mean the year for which the statement is to be made, 
The statement of the amount collected for school purposes, for the year 1868, 
has not yet been made, becuse the Tax Collectors have not yet closed their ac- 
counts for that year; and because it is impossible to make the estimate until the 
money Jor that year is collected, and the Collectors’ accounts setiled. The law 
that requires the Comptroller and State Treasurer to set aside the school money 
as it is collected, is inoperative and dead, of necessity; for the school tax ‘is col- 
lected with the State tax, aud by the revenue officers of the State, paid’ into the 
State depositories, and never reported to this office, or the office of the State Trea- 
suréer. ” We never see it; never hear anything aboutit; know nothing of it, and 
cannot. In the meantime, claims are presented to this office against the’ State, 
are examined, and Warrants drawn on the State Treasurer, instructing him to pay 
the amount allowed, If there is any money in the Treasury, a check is given, 
and the Comptroller's warrant taken up; warrants in fayor of Common Schools, 
in common with warrants for other purposes, Thus the matter works, and so it: 
will continue to work, while the law remains as it is. 
Very respectfully, 
G. W. BLACKBURN, Comptroller.

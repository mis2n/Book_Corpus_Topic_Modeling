PREFACE 
In sprte of the immense importance of agriculture in the 
life of the American people no one has yet had the temerity 
to essay a comprehensive history of this dominant branch of 
our economic activities. There exists a number of excellent 
studies of special phases or periods of our agricultural develop- 
ment, but no one of these is satisfactory for use as a textbook 
- on the subject. The growth in the number of colleges of 
agriculture and of agricultural high schools, however, is evidence 
of a demand for such a book. The writer has ventured, there- 
fore, to put out as an independent volume the chapters in his 
“Eeonomic History of the United States” which relate to this 
topic. It is hoped that this little book, brief as it is, may 
serve acceptably the needs of teachers of agriculture or of 
agricultural economics. If it meets with as cordial a reception 
as has been accorded the larger work, its publication will be 
fully justified.

CHAPTER I 
THE LAND AND ITS RESOURCES 
1. The conditions of economic development.— The main 
conditions of the industrial growth of any country consist of 
two factors character of the people and the natural 
resources. Only when the gifts of nature are bountiful and 
are intelligently utilized.by man can a nation attain to the 
highest degree of strength and prosperity. The presence of 
rich natural resources alone has not been sufficient to secure 
the development of a weak, ease-loving race like the Latin- 
American, nor has mere growth in numbers, as in China or 
India, been enough to make the nation wealthy and strong. 
“On the other hand, even a bold, vigorous race like the Scan- 
dinavian has not been able to make great advance in an in-~ 
hospitable country like Iceland. In the territory now included 
in the United States, a virile, energetic people found extraor- 
dinary opportunities for industrial development, and devoted 
themselves to the exploitation of the natural resources with 
wonderful success. The keynote of the national history of 
the United States is to be found in this work of winning a 
continent from nature and subduing it to the uses of man. 
A truly gigantic task, it has absorbed the main energies of the 
American people from the beginning, and has been approached 
in significance only by the struggle to preserve the Union. 
Inevitably it has left its impress on the character and ambi- 
tions of the people. For this reason, says Woodrow Wilson, 
. “the history of the country and the ambitions of its people 
have been deemed both sordid and mean, inspired by nothing 
better than a desire for the gross comforts of material abun- 
dance; and it has been pronounced grotesque that mere bigness  
-P-A-G-E-12
  2 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
and wealth should be put forward as the most prominent 
grounds for the boast of greatness. The obvious fact is that 
for the creation of the nation the conquest of her proper terri- 
tory from nature was first necessary; and this task, which is 
hardly -yet completed, has been idealized in the popular mind. 
A bold race has derived inspiration from the size, the difficulty, 
‘the, danger of the task. Expansion has meant nationaliza- 
tign; nationalization has meant strength and elevation of 
yiew.” 
/ 2. The character of the people.— Combining the best 
; /characteristics of many of the best stocks of Europe, the Amer- 
fies people have yet developed some distinctive traits. They 
are characterized by qualities of nervous energy, intelligence, 
independence in thought and method, boldness in initiative, 
and perseverance in enterprise. The absorption in material 
pursuits and the over-emphasis of the value of material suc- 
cess, in part the result of inheritance and selection, has been 
largely developed as a result of the industrial environment. 
Partly as a resutt of these same forces and partly inherited, a 
peculiar aptitude in the invention and use of labor-saving 
machinery has been noted. by all writers as a special charac- 
teristic of the American. Equally quick in devising original 
methods or adapting the ideas of others, he has applied ma- 
chine methods to every line of production. Called into being 
at first by necessity, American ingenuity has been fostered and 
developed, and has found probably its best application in the 
invention of complicated tools. ‘ 
| 3. Area of the United States.— The second great factor 
| in the development of the country has been its material ad- 
vantages. These purely physical foundations of greatness 
consist of expanse of territory, abundance of minerals, metals, 
and forest products, and extent of seacoast. In the first of these 
respects the United States has always been rich. By the 
treaty of Paris, 1783, the new nation came into possession of 
an immense domain of 827,844 square miles. Since that 
time the area of the United Ctctcs has been vastly increased,
-P-A-G-E-13
THE LAND AND ITS RESOURCES : 3 
by purchase, by conquest, and by cession, until, in 1900, the 
United States consisted of 3,726,500 square miles or about 
one-fourteenth of the entire land surface of the earth. Con- 
tinental United States, exclusive of Alaska or our island 
possessions, contains 2,972,584 square miles of land surface, 
or somewhat less than Europe, which has an area of some 
3,700,000 square miles. « 
4. The coast line. — The Garten to a nation of having 
a seacoast well provided with numerous bays and harbors 
are obvious. Not less important for the internal commerce 
of a country is a system of long and navigable rivers. In 
both these respects the United States is wonderfully well 
provided. The Mississippi River with its tributaries drains 
over 1,000,000 square miles of territory in the very heart of 
the most fertile region of the country. Cities more than 1000 
miles inland have direct water communication with the sea- 
board, and coal is transported more than 1000 miles from 
Pittsburg to the upper reaches of the Missouri River. Alto- 
gether, it is estimated that there are 18,000 miles of navigable 
rivers in the United States, while the shore line of the Great 
Lakes extends for at least 1500 miles more. The coast line 
on both oceans, including indentations, is not less than 18,000 
miles in length, which gives about one mile of shore line for 
each 165 square miles of surface. Europe, which is the most 
favored. in this respect of any division of the old world, is 
estimated to have 19,500 miles of seacoast, of which 3000 are 
within the Arctic circle, leaving only 16,500 available for com- 
merce, or one mile of coast for each 224 square miles of 
surface. 
5. Water power. — In this connection should be mentioned 
the amount of water power available for industrial use in the 
United States. In colonial days this was of chief importance 
and determined the location of many a town. With the in- 
vention of the steam engine and the use of coal as a motive 
power, industry became less dependent upon water power, 
but with the rise of electrical appliances and the harnessing of

our streams and falls for their service, we are beginning to value 
this item in our national wealth more highly. “It is prob- 
able,” says Shaler, ‘“ that, measured in horse power or by 
manufactured products, the energy derived from the streams 
of this country is already 
more valuable than those 
of all other lands put 
together.” The most val- 
uable water powers are 
found east of the Missis- 
sippi River and west of 
the Cordilleran chain. 
Even in the case of the 
best water power there . 
are, however, in spite 
of its cheapness, certain 
drawbacks: it must be 
applied where it is found, 
except as it is used to 
develop electric power, 1

the other hand, may be 
developed where it is needed, at any time and to any amount. 
On this. account the presence of coal has proved a more 
important factor than water power in determining the 
concentration of the population and the regional distribution 
of industries. 
6. Coal. — Fortunately for the human race, coal is widely 
distributed throughout the world, although Europe and the 
United States to-day supply practically all the coal now 
mined. Professor Tarr estimates: the actual coal-producing 
area in the United States at not over 50,000 square miles, of 
which only a small part is being worked. According to the   
    
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  6 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
United States Geological Survey there are 35,000 square miles 
of coal-bearing strata in this country, but much of it is too 
thin or impure to be available for industrial use. It serves, 
however, in many localities as domestic fuel, and few places in 
the United States are far removed from burnable coal. By 
far the greatest part of our available supply is bituminous, 
the area which is underlaid with anthracite being not more 
than 484 square miles. Not merely in the extent of the area 
underlaid with coal are we favorably situated, but our supe- 
riority over Europe and the rest of the world is made more 
evident by a comparison of the thickness of the seams, the 
depth, the dip, and the cost of working. In all these respects 
we have an advantage. 
7. Iron. — Next in importance to the fuel supplies of the 
United States rank its stores of iron ore. These exist. in large 
quantity and are widely disseminated, though in the main they 
occupy three great fields. On the east the Appalachian field, 
which stretches from Newfoundland to central Alabama, con- 
tains large deposits of rather impure ore. The deposits of the 
Lake Superior region are extensive and of remarkable purity, 
and are so situated that economical methods of mining and 
transportation to market are possible. In the Cordilleran 
district there are some ‘scattered sources of supply of iron, 
but owing to the distance from coal suitable for smelting, the 
ore remains undeveloped except for local purposes. Colorado 
smelts some iron ore from other States. The conditions of iron 
production in the United States are set forth as follows by 
Professor Tarr: ‘ An iron ore, in the present state of the iron 
industry, must occur in a very favorable position as regards 
market; it must be of good quality and considerable quantity, 
and favorably situated for extraction and smelting. Iron is 
now so cheap that, where mining operations are difficult, as, 
for instance, where the mine is deep, the vein narrow, gangue 
abundant, or transportation difficult, it cannot be mined.” 
Tron and coal, more than any other mineral substances, 
form the material basis of our industrial prosperity, and in
-P-A-G-E-17
THE LAND AND: ITS RESOURCES a 
_ the possession of large supplies of both, the United States 
is greatly blessed. 
8. Other metals.— Next after iron, copper ranks as the 
most necessary metal in the industrial arts. In primitive 
civilizations, as among the Indians, it was especially valuable 
because easily worked. With the discovery of processes for 
smelting iron, copper lost its earlier importance, which it has 
regained only in the last decade or so as the result of a rapid 
exténsion in the use of electricity. The United States is the 
L eenel copper-producing country in the world, turning out 
over half of the total amount. Most of it is mined in the 
States of Arizona, Montana, Michigan, and Utah. 
Lead and zine are often’found associated; in the circum- 
stances of their distribution they resemble copper, with which 
they are frequently found associated. In the production of 
both of these, the United States is surpassed by Europe. A com- 
paratively small amount of aluminum is produced here, but 
this, with other metals, is of minor importance. 
Of less total value, as well as of subordinate importance in 
the industrial arts, are the so-called precious metals — gold 
and silver. In the production of /both of these, the United 
States ranks second, the first places being held respectively 
by the Transvaal and by Mexico. These metals occur in 
many places throughout the country, but all the important 
deposits are found in the Roédky Mountain region. Since the 
discovery of gold in California, the Appalachian deposits have 
remained practically unworked. California heads the list of 
States as a producer of gold, and Nevada of silver (1912). 
9. Other minerals. — In addition to the metals some of the 
non-metallic mineral products of the United States should be 
mentioned. The country is well supplied with building stone, 
though, owing to its weight and size, the production of all but 
the best ‘varieties remains local. Phosphates, of which large 
deposits exist in Florida, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and 
in Utah and Wyoming, and other mineral fertilizers are of 
growing value as the need of enriching the exhausted soil
-P-A-G-E-18
8 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
becomes greater. Salt is obtained from the deposits of rock salt 
in New York, Kansas, and some other States, and also by the 
evaporation of brine in Michigan, Ohio, and New York. Struc- 
tural materials, as cements, clays, gypsum, and slate, and chem- 
ical materials, as sulphur and borax, can only be mentioned. 
10. Animal life. — The principal animals, as also the vege- 
table products, which do not constitute the original resources 
of the country, but are rather the results of man’s efforts, will 
be treated elsewhere under the appropriate headings. In this 
connection will be noted simply the value of the native fauna. 
The animal life indigenous to North America had enormous 
economic significance to the aborigines, less to the colonists, 
and has scarcely any to us to-day. Of all the fauna of native 
origin the turkey is the only one which has been domesticated. 
To the Indian the wild game, such as deer, buffalo, moun- 
tain sheep, etc., were of greatest economic importance, since 
they furnished him with food, and the materials for clothing, 
shelter, weapons, and other necessaries. To the early colonist 
and fur trader the fur-bearing animals, such as the beaver, 
squirrel, mink, sable, badger, fox, and weasel, were more val- 
uable. The presence of quantities of game in the neighboring 
forests was moreover of considerable importance to the colo- 
nist, as he was thus able to supply his table and vary his diet 
with a minimum expenditure of effort. Quantities of edible 
wild fowl too passed overhead every year, as pigeons, turkeys, 
prairie chickens, ducks, geese, quail, etc. To-day these have 
been practically exterminated, or a small remnant only sur- 
vives under the protection of strict game laws. 
Of far greater.importance from an economic standpoint are 
the fishes, the supply of which has not been so easily reduced. 
The salmon of the North Pacific coast stands easily first among 
these; foll followed by the cod, mackerel, herring, and shad of the 
Atlantic coast; and white fish, lake herring, and sturgeon of 
the Great Lakes. Oysters, gathered by the Indians in im- 
mense numbers, still form the basis of a lucrative industry on 
the middle Atlantic coast. The exploitation of all these native
-P-A-G-E-19
  THE LAND AND ITS RESOURCES 9 
resources of the United States has proceeded recklessly and 
ruthlessly, and only recently has some effort been made to 
conserve and maintain for future generations by scientific 
methods our native animal and vegetable wealth. 
11. The forest. — The forests of the United States cover 
an area of about 700 million acres, or more than 35 per cent. of 
the area of the country. Of these by far the greater part is 
found in the section east of the Mississippi, which originally 
was a vast continuous forest. In the northern States there 
stretched the great white pine forest, from which most of our 
lumber has come, from colonial days to the present; south of 
this in a broad belt lies the southern pine forest, whose most 
important tree is the yellow pine. In the Mississippi valley 
are found the hardwood forests of oaks, hickories, ashes, gums, 
etc. West of the Mississippi stretches a forestless, often tree- 
less, area of millions of acres; with the Rocky Mountains 
‘begins again the coniferous interior forest, and still further 
west the Pacific coast forest. In this interior section the chief 
lack has always been water rather than wood. 
* “ Our civilization is built on wood. ” From the cradle.to the 
coffin, in some shape « or other, it surrounds us as a convenience 
or a necessity.” The early settlers drew upon the forests for 
food, fuel, and shélter. And yet the dense woods of the 
Atlantic coast, which had to be cleared before crops could be 
raised, and which often concealed hostile Indians and animals, 
were regarded rather as an obstacle than a blessing. Vast 
areas were ruthlessly burned down and the land denuded of its 
forest growth. This lavish waste of one of our most important 
natural resources has persisted almost down to the present 
time, and we are only now beginning to realize the necessity 
and possibility of preserving and increasing this source of 
wealth. 
12. The fertility of the soil.— Among the valuable re- 
sources of a country should be included a good climate and a 
fertile soil: together, these are of great importance in promot- 
ing the welfare, prosperity, and material comfort of the people.

Considered as a whole, the fertility of the soil of the United 
States is remarkably great, but this can best be seen by de- 
scribing separately the six physical regions into which the 
. country is usually divided. Generally speaking, the dominant 
geographical features are two extensive plains and two great 
highland areas, each of which runs in a north and south direc- 
tion. The six regions may be briefly described as follows: 
(1) The Coastal Plain Region, although not very fertile, 
was the portion of the country first settled. Not more than 
12,000 square miles is untillable, it is well forested, and suited 
to the growth of wheat, corn, tobacco, and cotton. Furnished 
with unrivaled water power at the falls of the rivers and 
splendid harbors at their mouths, this region has been the 
seat of many large and important cities. 
(2) The Appalachian Region contains the greater part of 
the States of New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, the 
Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Ohio. .“ Taken 
altogether, this mountain system is perhaps the finest region 
for the uses of man that the world affords; its great length, of 
more than 1500 miles from north to south, gives it a range of 
climate such as would be had in Europe by a mountain-chain 
extending from Copenhagen to Rome. The total area of this 
Appalachian district, mountains as well as table-lands, is about 
300,000 square miles. This is an area equal to near thrice the 
surface of Great Britain.” ! 
(3) The Middle Prairie and Lake Region has an exceedingly 
fertile soil and an abundant rainfall; in the South, indeed, 
the moisture is excessive except for such plants as sugar, 
cotton, and rice, which form the staple crops of the lower 
Mississippi. The soil of the prairies is exceedingly fertile and 
is capable of supporting an immense population. Owing 
probably to glacial action the land is very level and there are 
no great forests in this section of the country. The natural 
advantages of this section for water transportation and for the 
cheap construction of railways are remarkable. The Missis-

sippi River and its tributaries, the Ohio and the Missouri, are 
navigable for over 10,000 miles, while for fully half that 
distance they are accessible by vessels of considerable size. 
| On the north the Great Lakes offer unrivaled facilities for 
water transportation, and with the “ Soo, ”’ Welland, and Erie 
canals afford an outlet to the ocean for the agricultural and 
| mineral products of the Northwest. 
| (4) The Great Plains or Steppe Region are a treeless ex- 
panse of grass lands. As a result’ of deficient rainfall, agricul- 
ture is impossible except where irrigation is used or along the . 
river bottoms. Consequently, the region is given over mainly 
to grazing and stock raising. z 
(5) The Cordilleran or Plateau Region is, next after the 
Himalaya system, the most extensive region of great altitude 
in the world. Probably nineteen-twentieths of its lands are 
irretrievably barren, while their great height reduces much of 
the land to the east to a condition of sterility. They contain, 
however, immense_mineral_ wealth. 
(6) ‘The Pacific Slope Region is of great fertility, well 
watered, and with an exceedingly equable and attractive 
climate, though containing also much barren land. Unfor- 
tunately, the coast of this region is broken by few harbors or 
navigable rivers, and its commercial development is therefore 
unlikely to equal that of the less fertile Atlantic coast region: 
it is also separated by a wide ocean from industrially unde- 
veloped countries. 
13. Temperature. — Next in importance to the fertility of 
the soil may be ranked the distribution of temperature and 
tainfall. Temperature has both a direct influence upon man 
and an indirect influence through its effect upon the plant and 
animal life at: his disposal. A cold climate seems best adapted 
to call forth those virtues which are helpful to economic prog- 
ress. Those portions of Europe which have sent forth the 
most energetic peoples and have developed the highest civi-° 
lization are situated between the lines of forty and seventy 
degrees average annual temperature. It is noteworthy that 
 
-P-A-G-E-23

THE LAND AND ITS RESOURCES . 13 
\ orth America is broadest in_ the temperate zone and tapers 
down to a narrow point in the tropical zone, in which respect 
it is the opposite of South America or Africa. The tempera- 
ture of the United States is substantially the same as that of 
western Europe, the mean annual temperature being 53° F., 
though the extremes of heat and cold are much greater in this 
country than in Europe. 
14. Rainfall.— Of not less importance than the temper- 
ature is the amount and distribution of moisture. An annual 
rainfall of at least 20 inches is essential to agriculture, districts 
with less than that being suited only to grazing, while a rain- 
fall much exceeding 50 inches produces a rank growth harmful 
to most of the plants grown in the United States. The average 
annual rainfall of the United States is 29.6 inches; east of the 
one hundredth meridian, however, the average is much higher 
and gradually increases towards the east and southeast: West 
of the one hundredth meridian the rainfall decreases as one 
proceeds to the west and southwest, the temperature rising as 
the rainfall declines. About three-quarters of the population 
are found in the regions enjoying an annual rainfall of between 
30 and 50 inches, the conditions there being most propitious 
for sustaining a dense population. : 
Climate and economic development.— Several advan- 
tages result from the possession by the United States of this 
varied yet well-balanced climate. Owing to the wide varia- 
tions in the climate and character of the land there exists an 
immense variety of plant life. The danger of a general failure 
of our staple agricultural crops is slight, for a loss in one part 
of the country is almost certain to be made good in another. 
A certain stability is thus given to agricultural products and 
prices. Another advantage exists in the variety of crops which 
such a wide range of climate ensures. Not merely does the 
United States lead all countries in the production of dairy prod- 
ucts, corn and wheat, of coal, iron, copper, lead, zinc, phosphate, 
sulphur, and petroleum, but the greater part of the lumber, 
meats, tobacco, and cotton, which enter into the world’s trade

come fron its forests and fields. This diversity of climate 
and resources has meant great diversity of occupations with 
attendant differences of interests, habits of living, and modes 
of thought. ‘While this fact has had a certain influence in 
dividing the people into sections with opposing interests, on 
the whole it has made for broadness of view and catholicity 
of interests. 
In its direct effect upon the race which has grown up in 
the new world, the environment seems to have made for a 
stronger and hardier people than any of those of the old 
world. The best available statistics on this point are prob- 
ably those gathered by Dr. .B. A. Gould, during the Civil War, 
' which are based upon measurements of over 1,000,000 soldiers.

CHAPTER II 
AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 
15. Colonial occupations.— During the colonial period 
agriculture was the main and, except in New York and New 
England, the only important industry. In those sections 
gommerce and fishing afforded other outlets’ for enterprise, 
but even there agriculture remained the most important in- 
dustry until after the beginning of the nineteenth century. 
When the first colonists landed they were compelled to resort 
immediately to the raising of food supplies, to keep them from 
starving, and what necessity dictated at first, was found later 
to afford the largest returns. In the Virginia Colony mis- 
guided efforts were made at the outset to direct the energies 
of the colonists into other channels, especially manufactures, 
by legislation and the offer of prizes and bounties, but the 
production of the more profitable tobacco soon absorbed all 
the energies of the colonists. In New England, on the other 
hand, the effects of a sterile soil and severe climate were 
supplemented by the restrictive legislation of England, which, 
by partially depriving the colonists of a market for their 
agricultural staples, helped to direct their efforts to fishing, 
ship-building, and commerce. The same circumstances 
characterized, to a less degree, the occupations of the middle 
colonies. In all the colonies, agriculture was the founda- 
tional industry, and limited and determined manufactures 
and commerce, where these existed. 
16. Pioneer farming.— The great attraction offered by 
America to the industrious settler — as by every new country 
— was an assured and independent existence. Owing to the 
quantity of free land, to be had practically for the asking, and 
17
-P-A-G-E-28
  18 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
the great fertility of the soil, even the pioneer with little or no 
capital could set up for himself and earn a living from the very 
beginning. Clearing a few acres for corn and a garden, and 
building a rude house alone or with the aid of his neighbors, 
he could, like the Indian, eke out his existence the first year or 
so with the aid of gun and net. After the second or third year, 
by clearing more land and raising a few cattle and hogs, his 
living was assured; and a large family, so far from being a 
burden, but made his work the easier. Such a pioneer farm, 
as were most of those in the northern colonies, was almost 
self-sufficing, producing practically everything needed in the 
household. All the necessary food, as well as flax, wool, and 
* hemp for clothing, leather for shoes, lumber for building, were 
raised at home. The few things’ not thus produced, such as 
salt, sugar, tea, coffee, and iron implements, could be pur- 
chased with the surplus produce. Unless situated on a river, 
with easy access to a market, there was little or no money 
profit in such an undertaking; the average colonial farmer 
handled little ready cash in the course of his life 
In the South the character of the staple products — tobacco, 
rice, indigo—demanded considerable capital, and conse- 
quently the lands fell into the hands of a wealthier set of 
~ proprietors. But even here the small farmer, ‘without the 
necessary capital to buy slaves or a large plantation, was 
able to support himself in comfort, if not in luxury. The in- 
terior counties of all the southern colonies saw a considerable 
settlement of these yeoman farmers. 
17. A Jack of all trades. — While practically every man in 
the early colonial period was a farmer, every farmer was at 
times also hunter and trapper, lumberman, or sailor. The 
pioneer settler, as later the frontiersman, supplemented his 
efforts in the fields by hunting and fishing as long as game 
abounded. Both for personal use and for sale for cash or 
supplies furs were in constant demand. With the growth of 
settlements and the disappearance of wild game, the colonist 
devoted his spare-time to getting out rough lumber products, 
   
-P-A-G-E-29
  
AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 19. 
such as planks, staves, and shingles. These could be made 
during the long winter months, by the fireside of an evening, 
while the women spun or wove. On the coast ships were 
built, and from every New England town many a farmer’s boy 
went on the fishing expeditions to the Newfoundland Banks. 
It was not long before these industries became so important as 
to call for the full time of those who pursued them. With the 
growth of towns, there was increasing opportunity also for 
division of occupations, but the farmer in the rural districts 
had to be a Jack of all trades throughout the whole colonial: 
period. Even in the towns a man was accustomed to turn 
his hand to almost anything that offered. Weeden gives an 
account of one John Marshall, who was a good typical speci- 
men of such laborers. He “ received about 4 shillings a day at 
Braintree from 1697 to 1711. He farmed a little, made laths 
in the winter, was painter and carpenter, was messenger, and 
burned bricks, bought and sold live stock. He was a non- 
commissioned officer in the Braintree Company, and a con- 
stable of the precinct. In one day he could make 300 laths.” 
18. Agriculture of Europe.— We shall obtain the fairest 
picture of colonial agriculture if we notice briefly its develop- 
ment in Europe at the time when America was settled; for the 
general equipment of knowledge and implements with which 
the colonists began their work in this country determined their 
immediate advance. The principal cultivated plants. of 
Europe, and more particularly Great Britain, at the beginning 
of the seventeenth century were few: wheat, barley, oats, rye, 
beans, peas, vetches, onions, cabbages, and apples. The list 
of tools was still shorter: those drawn by domestic animals 
were the plow, harrow, and cart; of hand implements, there 
were the sickle, hoe, and spade, essentially the same as had 
been used by the Egyptians four thousand years before; the 
flail and fanning mill, and the ax, completed the list. But 
simultaneously with the settlement of America there began a 
wonderful improvement in the agriculture of Great Britain 
‘through the introduction of the turnip and other root crops, 
 
-P-A-G-E-30
  20 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
the clovers and artificial grasses. These made possible a more 
scientific rotation of crops and the abandonment of the waste- 
ful two-field and three-field system. This improvement in 
British agriculture continued for over’a century, from about 
1600 to 1732, and emigrants to America during this period 
brought with them the results of these advances. 
19. Indian agriculture. — The colonists were also the bene- 
ficiaries of the knowledge of the Indians, from whom they 
rapidly learned the best methods of raising the indigenous 
crops, as well as economical methods of clearing and preparing 
the land for cultivation. As the early colonists practically 
adopted the Indian methods a description of these will serve 
as a picture of primitive colonial agriculture. Localities 
naturally devoid of trees were selected for cultivation where 
possible, or partial clearings were made in the forest by killing 
the trees, either by girdling them with stone axes or by build- 
ing fires around their bases. When they fell, they were burned 
into suitable lengths, rolled into a heap, and reduced to ashes; 
in this way the land was cleared with a minimum of labor. It 
was estimated that an industrious woman could burn off as 
many dry fallen trees in a day as a strong man could cut with 
a steel ax in two or three days. Even before the deadened 
trees fell the underbrush was cleared off and the corn planted 
amid the standing trunks. The corn was planted in rows, -and 
a dead fish often dropped as a fertilizer into the hole with the 
kernels; later it was hilled a foot or two high, and beans and 
pumpkins planted between the rows. This primitive agricul- 
ture was not merely rude; it was extremely wasteful and dis- 
orderly. But it had the merit of yielding quick and fairly 
large immediate returns for a minimum of labor expended, and 
on this account was largely employed by the early colonists. 
20. Colonial methods of farming.— The processes and 
methods of farming were primitive and traditional during the 
whole of the colonial period. Custom and often s ition 
controlled every step, and there was little or no advance made 
after the middle of the eighteenth century, when agriculture
-P-A-G-E-31
AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 21 
had probably fallen to its lowest ebb. Rotation of crops was 
unknown and manures were but little used. The Swedish 
traveler Kalm, writing of the James River Colony in 1748-9, 
said, “ They make scarce any manure for their corn-fields, but 
when one piece of ground has been exhausted by continual 
cropping, they clear and cultivate another piece of fresh land, 
and when that is exhausted proceed to a third.” Near the 
  A Coton1aL Wueet Prow or 1748 
The plow, which was clumsy and short, was sometimes attached to a pair 
of wheels. The ill-shaped share and mold-board did not plow deep or 
straight, and great strength and skill were necessary to guide the plow. 
“The wheels upon which the plow-beam is placed, are as thick as the 
wheels of a cart, and all the woodwork is so clumsily made that it 
requires a horse to draw the plow along a smooth field.” (Kalm, 
“Travels in No. Amer.,” II, 195). 
seacoast, indeed, they did fertilize their crops by planting 
fish with the grain, as they had been taught by the Indians, 
but this was not everywhere possible. 
Contemporary critics invariably called attention to the 
wasteful and unintelligent methods of agriculture practised 
in all the colonies. The author of “ American Husbandry,” 
writing just before the Revolution, criticises severely the 
_ general practice of exhausting the land by planting the same 
crop year after year: “they have not a just-idea of the im- 
portance of throwing their crops into a proper arrangement, 
so as one may be a preparation for another, and thereby saving 
the barren expence of a mere fallow.” He complains of the 
lack of enclosed fields to keep out the cattle, of the insufficient 
and slovenly tillage —“ worse ploughing is nowhere to be 
seen,”— and finally of the poorness of their implements. 
On the other hand, it must be remembered that the soil was 
extremely rich and did not require very careful tillage to yield 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
large returns. And when the productiveness of the soil was 
reduced it was cheaper to take up fresh land, of which there 
were practically unlimited quantities, than to restore the ex- 
hausted qualities. In the colonies labor was the most expen- 
sive factor in production and everything was done to 
economize in its expenditure; land, on the other hand, was 
cheap and was used prodigally. From the standpoint of the 
colonial farmer this was good agriculture, but it shocked the 
traveler from abroad who was accustomed to an agriculture 
based upon dear land and cheap labor. While it was not 
possible to apply European standards to the totally different 
conditions in America, still it must be admitted that this 
process of “ earth-butchery ” led to bad habits and was ulti- 
mately wasteful—a fact to which the country has only 
’ recently awakened. 
21. Experimentation and adaptation. — The first great task 
of the colonists was that of clearing the land and subduing the 
forces of nature; the second was to ascertain what crops were 
best suited to the new conditions. The problems presented 
to the colonists in the growing of crops were many and 
peculiar. They came to a country whose climate and soil 
were unfamiliar to them. The qualities of the native plants 
with which they were confronted had to be determined by 
experience. Seeds and plants from every part of Europe and 
even from Asia and the West Indies, which were brought here 
by settlers, had first to be tried in each colony before it was 
known in what soil or clime they would best flourish. For a 
century and a half this process of experimentation, adaptation, 
naturalization, and selection continued in all the American 
colonies, and so successfully that in the next one hundred 
years only a single commercially important new plant, namely 
sorghum, was introduced into the United States, and that 
about the middle of the nineteenth century. Hemp, indigo; 
rice, cotton, madder, millet, spelt, lentils, lucerne, sainfoin, 
were tried and failed in New England. In the southern 
colonies wine and silk culture, and such products as figs,
-P-A-G-E-33
ee ee 
AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 23 
oranges, olives, cinnamon, and allspice, were tried, but were 
found unsuited to that climate. On the other hand, many 
European crops proved to be especially adapted to the new 
environment and have become fully acclimatized. There was, 
however, practically no improvement in the plants, vegetables, 
and fruits by culture and selection, after they were once intro- 
duced, except in the case of tobacco, rice, and indigo, the 
quality and preparation for market of which were all greatly 
improved. 
22. Native plants.—To the early settlers the indigenous 
plants which they found in the new world were of far greater: 
importance than those which they 
brought with them. Of these, by 
far the most important at the time 
and in the subsequent history of 
the country was maize or Indian 
corn. The advantages of this grain 
lay not merely in the speedy ma- 
turity, the large yield, the inde- 
pendence of seasonal changes, and 
the usefulness of all parts of the 
plant, but especially in the ease 
with which it was cultivated. The 
early settlers soon learned from the 
  Hanp Corn SHELLER 
Indians the trick of planting it 
among the deadened forest trees, 
without plowing, with the pumpkin 
between the hills. Without this 
grain the early settlements 
would -have been much more diffi- 
cult of establishment. Maize, 
indeed, formed the main food 
crop of the colonists throughout To shell corn from the ears 
was one of the tasks carried 
on in colonial times during 
the long winter evenings. It 
was usually done by scraping 
the ears on the iron edge of

of a frying-pan, but some- 
times primitive hand-ma- 
chines were used. 
their entire history. 
Of considerable consequence also was the potato, both sweet 
and white. The food value and methods of cooking the 
former were early learned from the Indians, and the sweet  
-P-A-G-E-34
ee ee 
24 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
potato was in general use throughout the southern colonies. 
While the early history is somewhat obscure, it seems certain 
that the white potato was carried from Peru or Chile, where it 
was indigenous, into Spain about the middle of the sixteenth 
century. From that country its use spread throughout Europe, 
and it was introduced from Ireland into North America by 
the colonists about’ 1718. Since that time it has been an 
article of general consumption, although it has not occupied 
such an important place in this country as in the European 
dietary. The early use was retarded by the superstition that 
if a person ate potatoes every day he would not live longer 
than seven years; they were called “ Devil’s apples.” 
Timothy is another distinctively American plant, its culti- 
vation having begun about 1720. A few years later it was 
introduced into England from this country. This plant was 
of vast economic importance in the northern portions of the 
United States, where it was necessary to feed live stock 
during the winter upon hay gathered during the summer 
months. In the earlier colonial period cattle often starved to 
death in the long, severe winter, owing to a scarcity of food. 
‘Among other plants which the early colonists found, and 
which had an important effect upon their dietary, should 
be mentioned the pumpkin, squash, and probably also the 
strawberry. 
23. Tobacco. — Of all America’s gifts to the old world the 
most widely accepted has been tobacco. It was mentioned 
in Columbus’s diary for November 20, 1492, and is commonly 
understood to have been introduced from America into Eng- 
land by Sir John Hawkins about 1565. It soon came into 
general use and was made the object of regulation by successive 
English monarchs. In 1624 it became a royal monopoly, and 
in 1624, 1628, and again in 1631, the cultivation of the plant in 
England was forbidden, thus giving the colonial planters a 
monopoly of the British market. About 1616 its serious culti- 
vation began in Virginia, and from that time increased 
rapidly, until it had displaced all other crops and most other  
-P-A-G-E-35
  AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 25 
forms of industry. From the very beginning tobacco was one 
of the greatest articles of export from the North American 
colonies, constituting between one fourth and one half of all 
the exports during the colonial period. Tobacco combined a 
high value with a small bulk, and was thus well suited for 
export, as the cost of transportation was small in comparison 
with its value. The first shipment, in 1619, amounted to 
20,000 pounds; in the ten years 1700 to 1709 the average

Tobacco is grown in many parts of the United States, from southern 
Wisconsin to Louisiana, but the largest tobacco area, about 600 miles 
long and 400 miles wide, extends from Kentucky to Maryland, and from 
central Ohio to North Carolina. The illustration shows a modern tobacco 
field of the best type, as is evidenced by the size of the plants. The head of

annual export was 28,958,666 pounds; by 1775, 85,000,000 
pounds were exported annually, whose value was about 
$4,000,000. 
The production of tobacco was carried on in a very wasteful 
manner: the land was cleared by girdling the trees and was 
then planted in tobacco for three years and afterwards in corn.

sulted in exhaustion of the soil in from three to eight years, 
when fresh land had to be taken up. The population was 
consequently widely dispersed, the plantations of Virginia in 
1685 covering an area as large as England itself. 
24. Other plants. — The principal European grains and 
fruits were early introduced into the colonies, and their cul- 
tivation proceeded side by side with those of native origin. 
Indeed, the majority of the plants of great economic value 
to-day are of foreign origin. Next to maize the principal 
crops of the North were rye and buckwheat, and following . 
these wheat, oats, and some barley. The culture of wheat was 
given special attention and met with considerable success in 
the middle colonies. In the southern colonies, after tobacco, 
rice was the most important crop. Introduced into South 
Carolina in 1694, it grew abundantly; by 1724, 100,000 barrels 
were exported from that colony alone, and in 1761, when the 
white population was not more than 45,000, the value of the 
rice crop was over $1,500,000. Little cotton was produced 
during this period, but indigo, which was first successfully 
planted in 1741, was of considerable importance; in the last 
decade before the Revolution, South Carolina alone exported 
500,000 pounds a year, worth from two to five shillings a 
pound. Various fruits were early brought over from Europe, 
and grown wherever climate and soil were favorable, of which 
apples and pears were the most common; in addition to these 
were stores of wild fruits, as plums, grapes, and cherries, and 
berries and nuts to be had for the gathering.

can origin:

In general the principal agricultural products of the colonies 
were as follows: New England and the middle colonies, corn, 
rye, oats, buckwheat, wheat, and barley, with some tobacco: 
from.Connecticut; Maryland and Virginia, tobacco; the Caro- 
linas, tobacco, rice, indigo, corn, and a little cotton; Georgia, 
rice and indigo. Wool, flax, and hemp were also raised 
in- considerable quantities for home use in the different 
colonies, as were the more common vegetables such as turnips, 
onions, peas, carrots, parsnips, pumpkins, and cucumbers. 
25. Live stock— European cattle were imported into 
Spanish, French, and English colonies at a very early date, 
and increased very rapidly, especially in the South and South- 
west. The cattle brought over from England were much 
smaller than our present stock. According to Prothero, the 
average size of cattle and sheep sold in Smithfield market, 
London, as late as 1710, was: beeves, 370 Ibs.; calves, 50 lbs. ; 
sheep, 28 lbs.; lambs, 18 Ibs. The reason for the small size 
was that little or no attention was paid to the culture of 
grasses and vegetables for feeding the stock; they were left to 
   
-P-A-G-E-38
  28 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
graze, winter and summer. In 1795, after the general intro- 
duction into England of root crops and artificial grasses and 
clovers, the weights in London were: beeves, 800 Ibs.; 
calves, 148 Ibs.; sheep 80 lbs.; lambs, 50 Ibs. : 
The severe climate of New England caused a deterioration 
in the stock of that section; in the southern colonies, where 
they were turned loose in the forests, they multiplied rapidly. 
The author of “ American Husbandry ” reserved his severest 
criticism for this feature of American farming: “ Most of 
the farmers in this country are, in whatever concerns cattle, 
the most ignorant set of men in the world. Nor do I know 
of any country in which animals are worse treated. Horses 
are in general, even valuable ones, worked hard and starved: 
they plough, cart, and ride them to death, at.the same time 
that they give very little heed to their food; after the hardest 
day’s work, all the nourishment they are like to have is to be 
turned into a wood, where the shoots and weeds form the chief 
of the pasture; unless it be after the hay is in, when they get 
a share of the after-grass.... This bad treatment extends 
to draft oxen; to their cows, sheep and swine.” 
By 1639, the Jamestown Colony, in spite of this bad treat- 
ment, already had 30,000 cattle; in 1770, Wynne described the 
large herds, often numbering a thousand cattle, that were 
found in the Carolinas. Cattle-raising was an important 
frontier industry in many of the colonies, and dairy products 
were yielded in all of them for home use. Considerable quan- 
tities of butter and cheese were produced in New Jersey for 
export. Hogs multiplied rapidly, especially in the Southern 
colonies, where they ran at large in the forests. As a result 
there grew up a considerable export of pork; and Virginia 
hams and bacon came thus early to have a high reputation. 
Of animal food there were also, in addition to domesticated 
animals, plentiful supplies of wild game and fish in all the 
colonies. 
26. Farm implements.— One of the greatest obstacles to 
agricultural progress was the scarcity and rudeness of the
-P-A-G-E-39
  AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 29 
farming implements which the colonists possessed. Plows 
were imported from time to time, but they were extremely 
heavy and unwieldy. In 1637, there were but 37 plows in 
the colony of Massachusetts Bay, and towns often paid a 
bounty to any one who would keep a plow in repair, in order 
to do the plowing for 
the community. Virginia 
was rather better off in 
this respect, having 150 
plows in 1648. The mas- 
sive old wooden plow, “

addition to this imple- {be,2s"0m, a8 well as the fork, were ment, the colonists had 
the spade, a clumsy wooden fork, and now and then a harrow. 
All of these were rudely made of wood; the only metal avail- 
able was made of bog iron ore, which was very brittle and 
made the implement liable to break in the middle of a day’s 
work. The grain was cut with a sickle or “ hook” and was 
usually separated from the chaff in the southern provinces by 
the treading of horses on threshing-floors; in the North the 
flail, though slower, was more generally used. Hay and straw 
were raked and pitched by hand-rakes and forks made 
entirely of wood. Methods of farm transportation developed 
slowly, owing to the bad roads. Skids were sometimes used, 
and two-wheeled carts were common; a cart-wheel shod with 
iron was a prized possession. 
27. Appropriation of the land.—The claims of the European 
nations to the lands of the New World were based upon 
priority of discovery and exploration, of conquest, and of set- 
tlement. Of these the last named was the most important and 
the decisive factor in giving title. Thus the papal bull 
dividing the newly discovered lands between Spain and 
 
-P-A-G-E-40
30 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
Portugal did not deter other nations from taking possession 
of territory which they wished.. Nor was greater regard 
paid to the rights of the original possessors of the iand, the 
Indians. Some of the proprietors, like William Penn, or the 
states, like New York, made treaties with the Indians, by 
which these ceded their possessions to the white man; and 
after the establishment of the union the federal govern- 
ment was always careful to make treaties with the Indian 
tribes in which cessions of the land were made. But the 
early settlers were usually satisfied with titles to owner- 
ship based upon royal grants, and did not inquire too closely 
into the right of the European monarchs to claim and dispose 
of the land. 
28. Land tenures. — At the time of the settlement of North 
America, land in Europe was still generally held on feudal 
tenures, and the possession of land carried with it both social 
and economic privileges. The land system was a most intri- 
cate one, and land could be transferred only by elaborate 
feudal methods, while the rights of inheritance and bequest 
were still further limited. Ownership vested in a few, and 
not even the greatest thrift could obtain for the poor man a 
farm of his own. But land in a new country, where it could 
be had almost for the asking, soon came to be held and trans- 
ferred like any other species of property, and ownership of it 
conferred no special rights, except as it was generally made 
a condition to office-holding or the franchise. In some, 
especially the proprietary colonies, large estates were created 
whose proprietors enjoyed special privileges, while it was also 
made difficult for small cultivators to obtain land. 
The prevailing theory in England was that the title to land 
in America was vested in the crown, and from him all subse- 
quent rights were derived. By grant from the crown land 
passed to chartered companies and* tc proprietors and was by 
them regranted to individuals, while in the royal provinces 
the governors were given authority to make grants of land 
directly. By one way or another the land passed into the 
 
-P-A-G-E-41
AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 31 
possession of the actual cultivator. Many of the grants, 
especially those to the proprietors, were made under some 
form of feudal tenure, such as the exaction of an annual 
quit-rent. This followed from the theory that the king could 
not alienate the property of the crown and that the proprietor 
was really a tenant. When the proprietors in turn regranted 
the land, they also exacted a quit-rent which, though it was 
generally merely nominal, also proved a troublesome feature. 
The Revolution, however, swept away practically all traces 
of feudal land tenure or of feudal land laws. 
29. Land-holding in New England and the middle colonies, 
—wWhen the first settlement was made, the Pilgrims held 
their land and other property on a communal basis, turning 
their labor and products into a common pool, but a few years 
of failure caused the abandonment of this plan, as had been 
the case several years before in Virginia. Each of the original 
or new settlers was granted a certain number of acres as his 
share in the colony. Large estates never became the rule in 
New England, but small farms were typical, owing largely 
to the character of the soil and the crops, which necessitated 
careful cultivation. Throughout the whole section, and as 
far south as Delaware, communal holdings in the towns were 
also found; fields—usually three—were at first held in 
common, and the cultivation was decided each year in general 
meeting. Later, as the towns filled up and grew strong enough 
to protect outlying fields against raids, the arable meadow 
and wood land was divided. 
In the middle colonies, the land system was practically the 
same as in New England, both in character and results. Small 
farms held in fee simple were the rule. The only ex- 
‘ception lay in the large manorial grants made by the Dutch 
and confirmed and extended by the early English governors 
in New York. The manorial system, however, was restricted 
to the valley of the Hudson, and the large estates of from 
50,000 to even 1,000,000 acres lay in large part uncultivated 
until they were broken up into small holdings. The type of 
 
-P-A-G-E-42
  32 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
agriculture in the northern colonies as a whole, however, was 
self-sufficing, aiming to supply only the wants of the colonists, 
as little demand existed abroad for their grain. This self- 
sufficing system made necessary a large number of small 
farms worked by their owners, and these in turn produced a 
democratic, type of society. 
30. The plantations of the South. — While small farms were 
characteristic of the North, large plantations were in vogue 
in the South, though in both sections there were exceptions to 
the general rule. These large landed estates were owned by 
comparatively few proprietors, who constituted an aristocratic 
upper class in a strongly stratified society. The difference 
between New England and the South was mainly the result of 
economic causes: the fertile soil and the presence of a few 
staples for which there was a good market abroad, and which 
lent themselves to intensive cultivation, made the large 
plantation profitable in the southern colonies. They conse- 
quently devoted themselves to the production of tobacco, 
rice, indigo, and sugar cane, and developed a commercial type 
of agriculture, which demanded a large supply of cheap labor. 
The average size of the Virginia estate was about 5000 acres, 
while in New England the average farm was probably not 
far from 100 acres. On the other hand, in the seventeenth 
century, the value of an acre of New England land was about 
fourteen times that of an acre in Virginia. 
The law and practice regarding grants and inheritance was 
also partly responsible for the enormous estates of Virginia 
and of other colonies. Grants were made to the companies 
and “adventurers,” who undertook to establish colonies; as 
“head right” for the importation of settlers; to the settlers _ 
themselves; for meritorious service, to clergymen, physicians, 
and even to servants; or as gifts for purely personal reasons. 
The occupation of the land granted and the payment of a 
small annual quit-rent were the usual conditions to the issu- 
ance of a patent or title deed. 
Inheritance in the southern colonies, as also in New York,
-P-A-G-E-43
  AGRICULTURE AND LAND TENURE 33 
followed the law of primogeniture; the principle of entail was 
even more strictly applied in these colonies than in England. 
In New England and Pennsylvannia, while the right of the 
eldest son, was still recognized, he received only a double por- 
tion, the rest of the property being divided equally among the 
- other children. Primogeniture and entail were not abolished 
entirely until the Revolution. 
SUGGESTIVE TOPICS AND QUESTIONS. CHAPTER II 
The problems presented to the colonists in connection with agri- 
culture were several. The one first solved was how to raise the 
necessary food supplies; then came those of determining the best crops 
for each section andthe most profitable methods of production, and of 
obtaining the necessary capital in the form of farm implements. Finally, 
the best methods of distributing and granting title to the land were 
worked out.

CHAPTER II 
COTTON AND SLAVERY. AGRICULTURE 
31. The introduction of cotton culture.— Up to the time 
of the Revolution the culture of cotton had remained prac- 
tically undeveloped. Other products, as tobacco in Virginia, 
rice in South Carolina, and pitch and tar in North Carolina, 
had proven more profitable. Under the English colonial 
system, moreover, cotton manufacturing for export was for- 
bidden in North America. Even more important was the 
difficulty and expensiveness of cleaning the fiber from seed and 
impurities. According to Whitney a man could separate the 
seed by hand from only about one pound of lint of the short 
staple variety, or about ten pounds of the sea island cotton, 
in a day, which made the cost of cotton goods prohibitive 
for general use. 
With the outbreak of the Revolution and the consequent 
demand for garments, together with the removal of colonial 
restrictions and the encouragement to manufactures, consider- 
able stimulus was given to cotton production. Sea-island 
or long-staple cotton was introduced into the lowlands of South 
Carolina and Georgia in 1786, and proved well adapted to 
conditions there, so that its préduction increased rapidly. It 
could be cleaned of its seed by a simple roller gin; but the 
area suitable for growing it was limited, and attention was 
next directed to the development ofthe short-staple or 
“upland ” cotton on the interior lands. By 1789 the produc- 
tion of both varieties was estimated by Woodbury at 1,000,000 
Ibs.; in 1790 at 1,500,000 Ibs.; and in 1791 at 2,000,000 Ibs. 
Of this South Carolina produced three fourths and Georgia 
most of the rest. At the same time, the improvements in 
cotton machinery in England had created a vastly increased 
85

  36 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
market for raw cotton, the number of persons engaged in the 
spinning and weaving of cotton having increased from 7900 
in 1760 to 320,000 in 1787. 
32. Whitney’s cotton-gin.— The way was now open for 
the rapid development of cotton culture in the South; the only 
obstacle was the difficulty of 
cleaning the fiber. In 1792 
Eli Whitney, a Connecticut 
school teacher, while visiting in 
Georgia, had his attention 
directed to the need of a ma- 
chine for doing this work, and 
in April, 1793, succeeded in 
perfecting a cotton-gin by 
which the lint was picked from 
the seed by means of saw-teeth 
on a revolving wheel. By this 
machine three hundred pounds 
of cotton could be cleaned by 
one person in a day, and imme- 
diately the demand for it 
spread throughout the entire 
cotton region. Mr. Whitney 
and the partner he associated 
with him, Mr. Miller, made the 
mistake of endeavoring to 
monopolize the production and 
sale of the gins, but the 
planters would not wait for 
such a valuable invention to be 
supplied so slowly, and soon in- 
vaded his patents. The State 
of South Carolina granted him 
  Ent Wuirney 
Whitney was born in Massachu- 
setts in 1765 and graduated from 
Yale College in 1792. He then 
went to Georgia as a teacher 
and while there was asked by 
the neighbors, because of his 
known ingenuity, to make a ma- 
chine for them that would clean 
the seed from the cotton, which 
at that time was done by hand. 
His efforts resulted in the cot- 
ton-gin, the most important ma- 
chine ever invented in the 
United States. His patents were 
invaded and he made nothing 
from this invention, though later 
he acquired a fortune from the 
invention of firearms. 
$50,000 to secure the privilege of the gin for her citizens, and 
North Carolina about $12,000, most of which was soon spent 
in wasteful law-suits.

After the invention of the cotton-gin, American cotton, 
which had beer dirty and poorly picked up to this time, be- 
came a popular and marketable commodity. The production 
and export increased by leaps and bounds, as will be seen from 
the appended table.

Until Whitney’s invention the seeds had been 
removed from the cotton either by hand or by 
the roller mill. Now the cotton was forced by 
toothed cylinders through wire ribs, which 
separated the seeds from the lint. In a day a 
slave could clean by hand 1, by the roller mill

not know that cot- 
ton was raised for 
exportation in the’ 
United States; he 
accordingly in- 
cluded it among the 
articles not to be 
exported from the 
United States in 
American bottoms. 
The Senate, how- 
ever, did not agree 
to this provision.

not only in the North, where by 1804 legislation had been 
passed in all the States providing for its ultimate abolition, 
but in the South also. Except on the rice and indigo planta- 
tions of the Carolinas and Georgia the economic disadvantages 
of slave labor were so apparent that many prominent 
Southerners favored its early abolition. By 1796 Virginia, 
South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, and Maryland, 
of the southern States, had all forbidden the importation 
' of slaves. Indeed, so far had the movement towards the ex- 
tinction of slavery proceeded by 1794, that Tench Coxe was 
able to write in that year: “The separate American states 
(with one small exception) have abolished the slave-trade, 
and they have in some instances abolished negro slavery; 
in others they have adopted efficacious measures for its 
certain but gradual abolition. The importation of slaves 
is discontinued, and can never be renewed so as to interrupt 
the peace of Africa, or endanger the- tranquillity of the 
United States.” Even from Georgia came the statement 
by a representative in the fifth Congress: “Not a man in 
Georgia but wishes there were no slaves; they are a curse 
to the country.” The fall of the price of slaves was a 
further evidence of the growing unprofitableness of slavery: 
in 1790 the best hands could be bought for two hundred 
dollars each. 
The following quotation from the journal of Philip Fithian, 
a Princeton student and a tutor to a rich family in Virginia in 
1774, gives an enlightened view of slave labor on a great 
plantation during this period: “ After supper I had a long 
conversation with Mrs. Carter concerning Negroes in Virginia, 
and find she esteems their value at no higher rate than I do. 
We both concluded (I am pretty certain that the conclusion 
is just) that if in Mr. Carter’s, or in any Gentleman’s estate, 
all the Negroes should be sold, and the money put to interest 
in safe hands, and let the land which these Negroes now work 
lie wholly uncultivated, the bare interest of the price of the 
Negroes would be a much greater yearly income than what is
-P-A-G-E-49
  COTTON AND SLAVERY. AGRICULTURE 39 
now received from their working the Lands, making no allow- 
ances at all for the risk of the Masters as to the crops, and 
Negroes.” It is probable that, but for the invention of the 
cotton-gin and the consequent extension of cotton production, 
slavery would gradually have declined and _ disappeared 
through voluntary action. 
34. Effect of cotton culture on slavery. — With the first 
development of cotton-growing, white labor was resorted to 
and was expected to. prove adequate. The scarcity of such 
labor in the South, however, led to an early recourse to the 
use of slaves. The large slave-holders, too, eagerly seized the 
opportunity afforded by a new crop to employ their slaves 
in its production, for the former staple southern crops — 
indigo and rice — were declining in importance. As soon as 
the culture of cotton was undertaken by slaves on an extended 
scale, the social odium attaching to manual labor by a white 
man diminished still more the supply of free labor, and made 
cotton from that time on essentially a slave product. The 
same causes operated to repel immigrants from the southern 
cotton-fields, and made the South more and more dependent 
upon slave labor as the production of cotton became more 
important. The white farmers, who might have grown the 
cotton, either bought slaves themselves and became planters, 
or, tempted by the high prices at which they could sell their 
land, parted with their holdings and moved to the cheaper 
land on the frontier. 
It has been frequently asserted by southern writers that 
the success of cotton culture depended upon the existence of a 
supply of slave labor, and that the two were indissolubly con- 
nected. While the introduction of slave labor into the United 
States had, as we have seen, no connection with the production 
of cotton, it is true that the development of cotton culture at 
this time gave new life to a decaying institution and furnished 
it with an economic reason for existence during the next half- 
century. But cotton would have been grown with free white 
labor, if.slave labor had not been available.

35. Extension of cotton culture. — The movement towards 
abolition of slavery received a fatal check as soon as the culti- 
vation of cotton was shown to be profitable in the South. The 
demand for slaves increased with the extension of cotton cul- 
ture, and “side by side slavery and cotton pushed westward 
into the ‘back country’ of the Carolinas, across the pine 
hills and prairies of Georgia and Alabama, took complete 
possession of the alluvial lands along the Mississippi and Red 
rivers, and by 1860 were laying claim to the great central 
region of Texas.” At the beginning, in 1791, South Carolina 
and Georgia were the only important cotton-producing States. 
By 1801 Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee produced 
a scant quarter, and ten years later Louisiana added a little to 
the total production, but South Carolina and Georgia still pro- 
duced three fourths of the cotton grown in the United States. 
The rapid rise in the price of cotton during this period 
greatly stimulated its production: from 144 cents a pound in 
1790 the price steadily rose to 44 cents in 1799, owing to the 
increasing demand in England and at home; after this it de- 
clined to 19 cents in 1802, near which point it remained for 
the next six years. ‘The stimulus thus given to the extension 
of cotton culture may be judged when these prices are com- 
pared with the estimate of Woodbury that where lands and 
labor were low, 2 cents a pound for cotton in the seed, or 
8 cents when cleaned, would pay expenses. The production 
of cotton consequently increased from two million pounds in 
1791 to forty-eight millions in 1801, and to eighty millions 
in 1807, while the exports rose from less than two hundred 
thousand pounds to twenty-one million and sixty-four million 
pounds respectively, for the same dates. 
36. Growth of the slave-trade.— The increased demand 
for slaves to be used as hands in the cotton-fields led at first to 
an extension of the slave-trade and to fresh importations from 
Africa. Although the separate States had forbidden the 
traffic, the profits were so enormous as to encourage the growth 
of a vast illicit business. Finally, in December, 1803, South
-P-A-G-E-51

Carolina, influenced no doubt by the great gains to be secured, 
~ repealed all prohibitory laws and threw open her ports to the 
slave-trade. Charleston became the most important slave- 
mart in the United States, and grew rapidly in wealth and 
importance; in size it was the fourth largest city and seemed 
destined for a brilliant future. New England traders carried 
on a large share of the traffic, and slave-ships were fitted out 
in Boston and New York; the voyages were usually made 
  Deck Puan oF A Siave-SHip 
The men were ironed in pairs by the ankles, and men and women 
were compelled to lie on their backs on the deck with their feet 
outward, the irons on the men being usually fastened to the deck. 
The space “between decks” where they were confined was about 
3 feet 10 inches high, and packed so close that a space of only 
6 feet long and 16 inches wide was allotted to each slave. Here 
they remained while the human cargo was being collected (3 to 
6 months) and during the passage across the Atlantic (6 to 10 
weeks). In a tropical climate and under these conditions the mortal- 
ity was frightful. 
under the flag of a foreign nation. From 1804 to 1807 inclu- 
sive two hundred and two cargoes of negro slaves were taken 
into Charleston; of these, 8488 were sold for account of per- 
sons living in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. 
On January 1, 1808, the constitutional restriction upon federal 
interference would expire, and on March 2, 1807, Cuugress by 
law prohibited the importation of slaves. The act was disre- 
garded, however, as the punishment was insufficient — ille- 
gally imported slaves if captured were sold for the benefit of 
the State into which they were being brought — and a con- 
siderable illicit trade continued. Not until 1820 was the 
traffic made piracy, the penalty for which was death.
-P-A-G-E-52
  42 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
The restriction of the slave-trade, together with the growing 
demand for slave labor, forced up the price of slaves, which by 
1815 was two hundred and fifty dollars a head. This demand 
was met by the sale of the slaves from the exhausted tobacco 
plantations of the border States; they were sent to the cotton 
regions by the tens of thousands. 
37. Agriculture in the South, — The agricultural methods 
employed in this period were those which had come down from 
colonial days and were a wasteful kind of extensive agricul- 
ture. The land was cleared for cotton, as it had been for 
tobacco and corn, by girdling the trees and then burning them 
as they decayed and fell. Before the fields were ready for 
cotton a few crops of Indian corn or wheat would often be 
gathered. The ground was prepared and cultivated in a very 
primitive fashion, but few agricultural implements being used 
and those only of the rudest and strongest kind, such as even 
the most careless slave could not break. Fertilizers were but 
rarely used, not even the cotton seeds being returned to the 
soil, while-rotation of crops was unknown. 
Although cotton is ‘said to be the least exhaustive to the 
soil of the great staple crops of America, such methods rapidly 
wore out the land. “Agriculture in the South,” said John 
Taylor of Carolina, “ does not consist so much in cultivating 
land as in killing it.’ The land was used until exhausted 
and then deserted for a fresh piece. Owing to the ease of 
moving his slaves, which constituted the greater part of his 
capital, the planter was ever ready to move on. It is evident 
that such a one-crop system required unlimited quantities of 
land, and this fact explains the steady westward movement 
of cotton culture for the next fifty years. How far the use of 
slave labor was responsible for the wasteful character of agri- 
culture in the cotton regions it is impossible to say, but the 
relation between the two was intimate and southern agricul- 
ture showed no improvement until after the Civil War. 
38. Agriculture in the North. — Little progress was made 
in agriculture until after the Revolution; this event directly
-P-A-G-E-53
COTTON AND SLAVERY. AGRICULTURE 43 
and indirectly brought about changes which materially aifected 
American industry. Most of the effort of the farmers was 
still necessarily devoted to enlarging the cultivated area of 
their farms — clearing the ground and rerhoving timber and 
stones. So long as no available market existed for surplus 
products, a suitable stimulus was lacking to secure improve- 
ment in existing methods. Nor was the mass of the farmers of 
that time especially enterprising or well educated. Strange as 
such a complaint sounds to us, foreign travelers in the United 
States in the last quarter of the eighteenth century are nearly 
unanimous in describing the idling’and lounging of the people, 
which they seem to, have considered a national vice+ 
After the Revolution, the greater political freedom of the 
individual and the removal of restrictions upon foreign trade, 
together with the increased demand .for our products during 
the continental wars abroad, greatly stimulated the interest 
in agriculture. The formation of societies for the promotion 
of agriculture was also an important step, for they awakened 
inquiry and intellectual activity and paved the way for agri- 
cultural literature. Five such societies were organized be- 
tween 1785 and 1794 at Charleston, Philadelphia, New York, 
Massachusetts, and Connecticut. In 1776 less than forty 
newspapers were published in the country, none of them 
agricultural; but these societies published books, pamphlets, 
and papers, and thus prepared the way for the agricultural 
periodical and newspaper, which began early in the nineteenth 
century. By their meetings and publications the agricultural 
societies also secured a diffusion of the knowledge which had 
been acquired in the separate colonies and made repeated 
trials of the same thing less necessary; they also extended the 
use of improved implements and labor-saving machines. 
39. Farm ‘implements.— With the exception of plowing 
and harrowing, practically all farm operations at the end of 
. the eighteenth century were performed by manual labor with 
the aid of very rude and relatively ineffective tools. In the 
1H. Adams, Hist. of the U. S., vol. I, p. 56,

  44 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
first census only one manufactory of agricultural implements 
was mentioned, a small establishment. in Massachusetts which 
made annually 1100 rakes, valued at $1870; even as late as 
1820 only a few small factories of plows, scythes, axes, shovels, 
hoes, etc., were enumerated. The plow at the time of the 
Revolution was of essentially the same form as that of the 
ancients, with wooden mold-board and clumsy frame. The 
first patent for a cast-iron plow in the United States was 
granted in 1797 to Charles Newbold of New Jersey, who, after 
  Farmina Toors, 1790 
This meager list represents practically all the agricultural implements 
used by American farmers at the end of the eighteenth century. Notice 
the clumsy plow,- with wrought-iron share, wooden mold-board, and 
heavy beam and handles; the wooden rake and fork; the primitive 
scythe, sickle, and flail. Great manual strength was necessary to use 
these tools, and the work was most exhausting. 
spending, as he alleged, $30,000 in trying to get it into use, 
abandoned the attempt, the farmers declaring that iron plows 
poisoned the soil and prevented the growth of crops. The 
first really great improvement in the plow was the result of 
studies made by Thomas Jefferson on the shape of the mold- 
board. The introduction of the cast-iron plow into general
-P-A-G-E-55
  COTTON AND SLAVERY. AGRICULTURE 45 
use, which was completed by 1825, marked an era in American 
agriculture and led directly to many other improvements. 
Two other important. agricultural machines which were 
introduced during this period were the grain-cradle for cutting 
the crop, the first patent for which was issued in 1803, and the 
fanning-mill for cleaning it after it was threshed, which soon 
superseded the old hand-fan. A beginning was also made in 
the application of chemistry to agriculture, but the develop- 
ment of a science of agriculture did not take place until after 
1840. 
40. Live stock.—In the southern states there grew up a 
considerable stock-raising industry in Virginia and Kentucky, 
especially the raising of mules to supply the cotton planta- 
tions. Washington early became interested in the mule as an 
animal well adapted to the climate of the South and able to 
endure the hard usage accorded all animals by negro slaves. 
Indeed, he may be said to have been the founder of the mule- 
raising industry in the United States. In.the North several 
important developments in the live-stock industry began soon 
after the Revolution. American breeders began the importa- 
tion of English Shorthorns and Herefords for the purpose of 
improving the native stock, though these great breeds. had 
only recently been definitely established in England. Some 
of these cattle came to be known as the “ milk breed ” and 
others as the “ beef breed.” 
The breed of horses was also improved by the importation 
from England in 1788 of Messenger, the famous sire of Ameri- 
can trotters. Since the trotting horse is one of the very few 
distinctive breeds of live-stock which this country has devel- 
oped, this event is noteworthy. It is supposed that the Cones- 
toga horses, which later became famous as the freighters in 
western Pennsylvania, were developed during this period from 
some large Flemish horses which the Dutch had brought to 
New York. Oxen were still the principal work animals on 
the farm, though because of their slowness and clumsiness 
they gave way to horses as soon as horse-drawn farm ma- 
 
-P-A-G-E-56
  46 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN: AGRICULTURE 
chinery was introduced. With the importation of the first 
Merinos in 1793 noteworthy efforts were made to improve 
the breed of sheep. Great numbers of the famous Spanish 
sheep were thrown on the European market as the result of 
the Napoleonic wars, and enterprising American farmers 
began importing them, so that by 1809 there were 5,000 in 
the country. 
41. Agricultural products. — The agriculture of the period 
under discussion was for the most part simply self-sufficing, 
though of some articles there was an exportable surplus. Of 
these tobacco was the most important until 1803, when it was 
passed by cotton, which thereafter constituted. about one 
third ‘of our agricultural exports. In New England hay was 
the most important single crop. The production of grains 
and live stock was greatly increased by the rapid settlement 
of the Ohio Valley; the population of Kentucky, Tennessee, 
Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois increased in the decade ending with 
1810 from about 300,000 to 935,800. Most of the increase in 
foodstuffs was, however, consumed at home by the growing 
population. The total production cannot be stated, but there 
was, in addition to tobacco and cotton, a considerable export 
of wheat and flour, rice, Indian corn and meal, beef, pork, 
tallow, hams, butter and cheese, lard, live cattle, and horses.

The value of the exports from 1802 on, when statistics were 
first collected, is shown: in the preceding table. It should 
be remembered, however, that owing to -the Napoleonic 
wars abroad, the exports during these years were abnormally 
large; during the embargo and the War of 1812 they declined 
greatly. 
A characteristic of the early years of the century was the 
concentration of farming upon the cultivation of the more 
- profitable crops and the elimination of many which had long 
been under experiment. In New England and the middle 
States attempts were still being made to grow lucerne, vetches, « 
rape, spelt, spurry, poppies, madder, woad, and similar crops, 
but the discussions initiated by the agricultural societies 
showed most of them to be unprofitable and their culture was 
now finally discontinued. 
42..Causes of agricultural progress. — In addition to the 
condition already named, President F. A. Walker mentions+ 
three other causes which he thinks were responsible for our 
great progress and pre-eminence in agriculture since the colo- 
nial days. First, the vast breadth of virgin lands, which 
required only the cultivation of the best soils. Second, the 
popular tenure of the land and excellent laws for the regis- 
tration of titles and transfer of real property. Third, the fact 
that the agricultural class, unlike the body of cultivators in 
almost every country in Europe, had never constituted a peas- 
antry, in any proper sense of that term. ‘“ The men who tilled 
the soil here were the same kind of men, precisely, as those who 
filled the professions or engaged in commercial or mechanical 
pursuits. ... This state of things made American to differ 
from European agriculture by a wide interval. There was 
then no other country in the world . . . where equal mental 
activity and alertness have been applied to the soil as to trade 
and industry. But even more than the total effect of the 
fortunate conditions which have been indicated, American 
agriculture in those days owed its really remarkable power to 
1 The Making of the Nation, p. 66. 
 
-P-A-G-E-60
48 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
a special, almost a technical, quality of our people; namely, 
mechanical insight and invention.” 
43. Public lands and early land policy. — At the close of 
the Revolution the lands between the Alleghanies and the 
Mississippi River, which were ceded by England in the treaty 
of 1783, were claimed by seven of the original States. Their 
claims, based upon colonial grants, were confused and often 
conflicting, and led to dissensions, especially with the landless 
States. Owing chiefly to the insistence of Maryland, the 
States finally agreed to cede their rights to the western lands 
to the central government, and by 1802 the. United States, 
which did not own a single acre of land in 1781, was in posses- 
sion of an immense public domain of 333,108 square miles. 
Since that time it has been increased by annexation and 
purchase, and at the same time reduced by sale and gift. 
In the disposal of the public land two distinct policies have 
been pursued by the United States. According to the first, 
which continued from about 1784 to 1820, it was held that the 
lands should be used and sold for the sake of revenue and to 
pay off the public debt. Under the second, which has obtained 
from 1820 to the present time, the western lands were to be 
disposed of —sold or given away — to settlers and others for 
the sake of developing the country. As a rapid disposal of the 
public lands and immediate revenue were desired at first, it 
was provided in 1785 that land should be sold only in large 
quantities; 640 acres was the minimum amount one person 
could purchase. Under this act a few large sales were made, 
all in the present State of Ohio, amounting by 1800 to 1,484,087 
acres, or less than 100,000 acres a year. The effect was 
to concentrate the holdings in the hands of a few large 
speculators or proprietors rather than in the possession of 
actual settlers, and this policy was accordingly modified 
in 1800. 
44. Sales on credit.— The act of May, 1800, and subse- 
quent acts permitted the sale of land in minimum tracts of 
160 and 320 acres, on credit, at the fixed price of $2 an acre.

Under the influence of the credit provision, by which only

made, amounting in the next twenty years to about 18,000,000 
acres. Many of the purchasers were speculators and many 
were settlers who had assumed obligations beyond their ability 
to fulfil, especially during the hard times from 1808 to 1815. 
After that year the great rise in the price of cotton to 26 and 
 
-P-A-G-E-62
  50 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
34 cents a pound led to still greater speculation in western 
lands, amounting to over five and a half million acres in the 
single year 1819. The fall in the price of cotton the follow- 
ing year and other causes led to another crash, and the arrears 
to the government for land sales grew to $21,213,350. Nu- ° 
merous relief acts had already been passed upon the demand 
of impecunious debtors, but in 1820 the matter was finally 
adjusted by allowing those indebted to the government to 
obtain the proportion of land already paid for by relinquish- 
ing the remainder to the United States. About 2,500,000 
acres reverted to the government under these acts. Perhaps 
three-fourths of the settlers who moved west before 1820, 
however, had not purchased their lands at the public land 
offices, but had settled in regions like Kentucky or Ten- 
nessee, which had never come under the land system, or on 
land held under earlier titles, as in Ohio. These lands could 
generally be had for less than the minimum price of the 
public lands. 
  SUGGESTIVE TOPICS AND QUESTIONS. CHAPTER III 
The problem of the South had been to find a profitable staple crop 
to take the place of the declining tobacco and rice culture. With the 
success of cotton growing the paramount problem became that of 
obtaining an adequate labor supply. In the North the problem was 
rather that of providing labor-saving devices and of eliming 38 un- 
profitable crops and processes.

CHAPTER IV 
THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT 
45. Significance of the westward movement.— From the 
beginning of our history the general movement of the popula- 
tion has always been westward, but the expression “ westward 
movement” has a peculiar significance during this period, 
for now began on a large scale the serious task of occupying 
and subduing the country west of the Alleghanies. Other 
peoples in their growth have had to meet and conquer rival 
nations. With the exception of the Indians, who often 
obstructed or diverted, but never permanently hindered the 
westward expansion, the only serious obstacles at this time 
in the way of the Americans were the natural barriers and 
the inadequacy of the existing means of transportation. It 
was the quiet, restless, onward march, not of an invading 
army, but of peaceful settlers. For three quarters of a cen- 
tury this continued, giving character to American life and a 
sturdiness and energy which were lent only by contact with 
_primitive conditions and large opportunities. The very 
nature’ of the people seems to have been changed by this 
great task of subduing a continent, gaining at once in initia- 
tive and vigor. 
Beginning almost with the Revolution, and continuing 
with renewed energy after the embargo and the War of 1812, 
the people of the United States addressed themselves as a 
nation to the development of their internal resources. After 
1808 capital and labor began to be diverted from commerce 
and shipping and invested in western lands and eastern manu- 
factures; attention was now directed to internal development 
rather than to foreign policy. Since then the great work of

the American people has been that of opening up and exploit- 
ing their own resources, and has been surpassed in impor- 
tance, if at all, only by the struggle for the preservation of 
the Union. This was the beginning of an economic revolution - 
and has given color to and dominated our entire industrial 
and political history from that day almost to the end of the 
nineteenth century. 
46. Early westward migration.— The successful ending 
of the French and Indian War, which gave to England the 
territory east of the Mississippi and removed the fear of 
French aggression, afforded. the opportunity for a westward 
movement of the population, though this was opposed by the 
British government in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. It 
‘could not be restrained, however, and the earliest advance 
took place into what is now Kentucky and Tennessee. The 
territory between the Tennessee and Ohio rivers had been 
ceded to the English by the Indians, by the treaty of Fort 
Stanwix in 1768 and other treaties, and lay invitingly open. 
to settlers from Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, and North 
Carolina by way of the Ohio River and its tributaries or by 
the Cumberland Gap. The movement was a slow one, re- 
tarded by Indian resistance and, both before and after the 
Revolution, by English hostility, both of which had to be 
met and overcome, largely by the efforts of the settlers them- 
selves. Politically these early settlements were of great im- 
portance in settling the dispute with Great Britain for 
possession of the western crown lands. By 1790 there were 
about 200,000 persons in the territory west of the Appala- 
chian Mountains; ten years later, 387,183; and in 1810, 
1,075,398. The distress which followed the War of the 
Revolution and the attendant economic chaos drove the people 
from the seaboard over the mountains in search of new 
fortunes. ! 
47. Movement of the population.— There was a rapid 
settlement of the Mississippi valley after the purchase of 
Louisiana, and between 1810 and 1820 that movement re- 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT 55 
ceived a new stimulus. In 1810 about one million people 
were living in the western States and territories, a number 
which more than doubled within the next ten years. So long 
as land was to be had, the rate of movement westward has 
always been a fluctuating one, being retarded or hastened by 
the economic condition of the people: in good times it has 
been slow; in bad times, rapid. During the period of de- 
pression following the Revolution, the migration from the 
Atlantic seaboard was rapid. It declined during the good 
times of the Napoleonic wars, with the exception of a huge 
wave at the time of the Peace of Amiens, which sufficed to 
bring Ohio into.the Union. The embargo and the War of 
1812 again sent streams of settlers west in search of better 
conditions. This movement has been well described in Peck’s 
New Guide for Emigrants to the West, published in Boston 
in 1837, in the following passage: 
“Generally, in all the western settlements, three classes, like the 
waves of the ocean, have rolled one after the other. First comes the 
pioneer, who depends for the subsistence of his family chiefly upon the 
natural growth of vegetation, and the proceeds of hunting. His 
* implements of agriculture are rude, chiefly of his own make, and his 
efforts directed mainly to a crop of corn and a ‘truck patch.” ... A log 
cabin, and occasionally a stable and corn-crib, and a field of a dozen 
acres, the timber girdled or ‘ deadened,’ and fenced, are enough for his 
occupancy. ... The pre-emption law enables him to dispose of his 
cabin and corn-field to the next class of emigrants; and, to employ 
his own figures, he .. . ‘clears out for the New Purchase’... to work 
the same process over, 
“The next class of emigrants purchase the lands, add field to field, 
clear out the roads, throw rough bridges over the streams, put up hewn 
log houses with glass windows and brick or stove chimneys, occasionally 
plant orchards, build mills, school-houses, court-houses, etc., and exhibit 
the picture and forms of plain, frugal, civilized life. 
“ Another wave rolls on. The men of capital and enterprise come. 
The settler is ready to sell out and take advantage of the rise in 
property, push farther into the interior and become himself a man of 
capital and enterprise in turn. The small village rises. to a spacious 
town or city; substantial edifices of brick, extensive fields, orchards, 
gardens, colleges, and churches are seen.”
-P-A-G-E-68
  56 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
48. The settlement of the West.— The three types just 
mentioned represent three stages in the development of the 
West, and as many steps in the process of pioneering. The 
early pioneers who moved out to the frontier just after the 
Revolution did so under very different conditions than were 
present in the later movement. Without improved means of 
transportation they were forced to make their way on foot, 
on horseback, or by wagon, over roads which were but 
slightly improved trails. The settlement of the West may 
fairly be regarded, as Callender suggests, as a great example 
of colonization, for the land journey from, say, Connecticut 
to Ohio was more difficult and expensive to make than the 
ocean journey from Europe to New England. Arrived at 
his destination, the pioneer was cut off from communication 
with his old home, and suffered all the inconveniences and 
hardships of settlement in a new country. With little capital, 
even in the form of adequate agricultural implements, with - 
no markets—certainly no convenient ones—for the ex-~ 
change of his surplus products, he was thrown back entirely 
upon his own resources. Under these conditions life was hard 
and progress was slow. 
When the second generation pushed their way along the 
track thus marked out for them, they had the advantage of 
improved means of transportation—turnpikes and canals, 
and later still the railroad. The West was thus-made at once 
more accessible for settlers and they were able more easily to 
reach markets, which moreover had now grown up and were 
ready to purchase their surplus products. So important were 
these factors that one observer called the railroad the “ soul 
of western civilization.” The very facility of movement 
brought evils of its own and induced a migratory spirit among 
the people, which made them ever ready to move on. The 
last stage in western progress is reached when the men of 
capital come. They are the permanent settlers and intro- 
duce permanent improvements: they build durable houses, 
establish manufactories, and develop the resources of the
-P-A-G-E-69
  THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT 57 
country. But by the time this stage in development has been 
reached the frontier has been pushed farther on, and the work 
of real pioneering is being done by other hands. 
49. Results of the movement.— The population of the 
northwestern Stites — Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wis- 
consin, Iowa — increased from 50,240 in 1800 to 792,719 in

1820, and 2,967,840 in 1840. “We are great,” said Calhoun 
in 1817, “and rapidly —I was about to say fearfully — 
growing.” So grcat indeed had this westward migration be- 
come by 1817 that its effects were already apparent in the 
East, from which most of the settlers came. In New York 
the increase in population between 1810 and 1816 was only 
3600, which was much less than the gain in the number of 
immigrants in the State. The West, on the other hand,
-P-A-G-E-70
58 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
developed rapidly; but there was no sudden growth of cities. 
The population simply spreal out over a wider territory, 
which it brought under cultivation. Thus from 1829 to 1830, 
while the population increased 32.5 per cent., the settled area 
increased 24.4 per cent.; between 1830 and 1840 the increase 
respectively was 32.5 per cent. and 27.6 per cent.’ During 
this twenty-year period, therefore, in spite of the fact that 
the population almost doubled, the density of the settled 
area increased by only about two individuals to the square 
mile. Great as was this movement, the real significance lay 
not so much in the increase in population as in the opening

up of the West. Before they could make any economic 
contribution to the rest of the country, however, the western 
settlers must have access to a market. There must not only 
be improvements in the means of transportation and com- 
munication, but there must be a demand for their products. 
The first of thcse conditions was in large measure met by 
the invention of the steamboat; the second by the spread of 
eotton culture through the Southwest.

_ 50. Western trade. — In the frontier of a country, accord- 
ing to Ratzel, is to be found an index of its growth or decay. 
Judged by this standard the early western settlements were 
significant of great national vigor. Cut off as they were 
from easy communication with the eastern seaboard, they 
were compelled to become largely self-supporting and eco- 
nomically independent. Of necessity the settlers were forced, 
by the high prices of imported goods, to manufacture articles 
of daily use. Almost every community had a grist and saw 
mill, while many had forges, tanneries, and salt works, paper 
and cotton mills. A few products like hides, furs, and gin-

little in the way of surplus products to sell and no important 
market. By 1807 the total value of the produce received at 
New Orleans was only $5,370,000. 
51. The introduction of the steamboat on western waters. 
— Within four years after the launching of the Clermont on 
the Hudson (1807) the first steamboat was introduced on 
the Ohio; but not until 1816 did it succeed in making the trip

current. With that event began the era of successful steam 
navigation on the Mississippi and its tributaries. The 
number of steamboats on the western rivers increased rapidly, 
from 14 in 1815 to 200 in 1829, and 450 in 1842. An especial 
impetus was given to the steamboat trade in 1824 by the 
decision of the Supreme Court in the celebrated case of 
Gibbons vs. Ogden, that the waters of the Hudson, and hence 
of other rivers throughout the United States, were the 
heritage of the people and could not be monopolized by any 
State or individual. A company, headed by Fulton and 
Livingston, who had made the first experiments on the Ohio 
and Mississippi, had obtained a charter from Louisiana giving 
them the exclusive right of navigating the Mississippi with 
steam vessels for fourteen years. This monopoly was now’ 
broken down and navigation made free to all, subject only 
to Federal legislation. In 1825 the steamboat had passed 
all competitors and in the next year carried fifty-seven per 
cent. of all the freight to New Orleans. ; : 
Side by side with the steamer a considerable flatboat trade 
still existed, of which a picture is given by Levi Woodbury, 
who made a trip down the Mississippi in 1833. 
“ At every village we find from ten to twelve flat-bottom boats, which 
besides corn on the ear, pork, bacon, flour, whiskey, cattle and fowls, 
have a great assortment of notions from Cincinnati and elsewhere. 
_ Among these are corn brooms, cabinet furniture, cider, plows, apples, 
cordage, etc. They remain in one place until all is sold out, if the 
demand be brisk; if not, they move farther down. After all is sold out 
they dispose of their boat, and return with the crews by the steamers 
to their homes.” 
In course of time, as the plantations grew larger, this 
method of peddling from wharf to wharf declined. The 
planters engaged agents at New Orleans to sell their cotton 
and to purchase supplies, which were shipped back by 
steamer. After about 1846 there was a gradual decrease in 
the number of flatboats, and by 1856 they had ceased to be a 
factor in the river trade and were no longer listed among 
the arrivals at New Orleans.
-P-A-G-E-74
  62 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
52. Extent of the internal trade.— The ‘steamboat had 
furnished the western territory with a fairly rapid and ade-- 
quate means of transportation, and its effect upon the trade 
of that section was quickly seen. Rates were high at first: 
from New Orleans to Louisville in 1816 freight rates were 
$112 a ton and passenger fares $125 (half rates down stream), 
but they were materially reduced as soon as the trade became 
established. The improvement in speed, by reducing the 
time, increased the number of trips. The value of the com- 
merce carried on the rivers expanded greatly. The value of 
the produce received at New Orleans in 1816 was $8,062,540, 
of which at least eighty per cent. came from the Ohio and 
upper Mississippi. This increased by 1829 to $22,065,518) 
and to $49,763,825 in 1840. The shipments were at first raw 
agricultural products, then articles like pork, flour, and others 
that required some process of treatment, and finally simple 
manufactured articles, such as bagging, rope, twine, candles, 
glass, and iron. They tell the story as well of the industrial 
advance in the Ohio valley as of the growing commerce be- 
tween the sections. By 1842 the money value of the direct 
river trade to New Orleans was given as $50,506,903. In- 
cluding the intermediate trade and the passenger traffic, the 
total commerce of the western rivers was probably over 
$100,000,000. 
At the same time the trade on the Great Lakes was steadily 
growing, though not so rapidly as the river commerce. In 
1816 the first steamer was built on the waters of Lake 
Ontario, and three years later the first steamer on Lake Erie, 
the Walk-in-the-Water, was launched. The building of, the 
Erie Canal greatly stimulated the lake trade, the tonnage 
on all the lakes increasing from 3500 in 1820 to 20,000 in 
1830, and 75,000 in 1840. 
53. Spread of cotton culture in the Southwest. — The 
second condition to the development of the West lay in the 
creation of a market. This condition was met by the exten- 
sion of cotton culture into the Southwest, which at once led 
 
-P-A-G-E-75
  THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT < 68: 
to the settlement of that section and developed a market for 
the surplus agricultural produce of the North. At the time 
of Whitney’s invention cotton was raised only in Georgia 
and South Carolina; thence it spread to North Carolina and 
Virginia during the early years of this century, but for more 
than twenty years it was confined to the Atlantic seaboard. 
By 1811 a beginning had been made in Tennessee and Louisi- 
ana, but together they produced only one sixteenth of the 
cotton raised in the United States. After the war with Eng- 
land, Alabama and Mississippi also began to attract attention 
as cotton-growing regions, and for the next twenty-five years 
a perfect stream of immigrants poured into this fertile district. 
By 1821 the four last mentioned States raised one third of 
the cotton grown in the United States, by 1831 nearly one 
half, and by 1834 over two thirds. The production of sugar 
was also increasing in Louisiana at this time, and was very 
profitable. The growing importance of this section may be 
shown by the exports of cotton from Louisiana, which in- 
creased from five million pounds in 1810 to thirty in 1820 
and one hundred and sixty-four in 1834. At the same 
time the population of the South was growing by leaps 
and bounds: Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi increased 
from 116,908 in 1810 to 355,756 in 1820, 660,667 in 
1830, and 1,318,818 in 1840, practically doubling every ten 
years. 
54. Effect on the South. — The effect of this extension of 
cotton culture into the Southwest was first of all to increase 
enormously the production of cotton. From 85 million 
pounds in 1810 the annual production grew to 160 in 1820, 
and 350 in 1830. Owing to a steady fall in the price of 
cotton the total value of the crop does not show the same 
increase, the figures for the same years being $13,600,000, 
$27,200,000, and $35,000,000; over three fourths of this was 
exported. With such a profitable crop all the energies of the 
southern planters were devoted to extending the cotton area, 
other crops being completely neglected. At the same time
-P-A-G-E-76
64 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
slavery was firmly established on an economic foundation, 
and so far as the South was concerned the whole gain of the 
extension of cotton culture went to build up and extend the 
system of slavery. The circle of investment, as described 
by a southern journal, was ‘“‘ making more cotton to buy more 
negroes to raise more cotton to buy more negroes.” Most 
of the planters in the Southwest were slave-holders who came 
from the older slave States with their property; two hundred 
and fifty thousand slaves are reported to have been brought 
into this region during the single year 1836. 
By the ordinance of 1787 and subsequent acts of Congress 
slavery. had been forbidden north of the Ohio River and east 
of the Mississippi, but as yet the question of slavery west of 
that great river had not been settled. In 1812 the slave 
State of Louisiana was admitted to the Union, and in 1818 
Missouri applied for admission, followed a year later by 
Maine. The question as to whether Missouri should be ad- 
mitted as a free or a slave State was hotly debated. Finally, 
in 1821, by the so-called Missouri Compromise, Missouri was 
admitted as a slave State, while, to balance the concession 
to the slave-owners, Maine was admitted as a free state and 
slavery was forbidden in the remainder of the Louisiana 
purchase north of Arkansas. Thus the cotton-growing States 
of the Southwest were opened to slavery and remained so 
until the time of its final abolition. 
55. Slavery is firmly established. — The development of 
slavery proceeded with the spread of cotton culture and be- 
came firmly identified with it. By 1822 the large plantation 
slave system was taking the lead, and by 1840 it had dis- 
placed the small planter who was working with free labor. 
The character of slavery had meantime changed from the 
patriarchal serfdom of colonial days to a well-organized in- 
dustrial system upon which was founded the economic devel- 
opment of the South. At the same time the attitude of the 
South towards the institution changed with the expansion of 
the cotton industry. From 1808 to 1820 many Southerners
-P-A-G-E-77
  
THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT 65 
were willing to abolish the slave system, could it be done 
safely and without loss. From 1820 on, however, there was 
no talk of abolition; the demand for cotton and the move- 
ment into the rich bottom lands of Mississippi led to a de- 
mand for labor which could not be supplied even by the 
traffic which prevailed between the slave-breeding border 
States and the cotton-growing Gulf States.. An illicit slave- 
trade accordingly sprang up between Africa and the West 
Indies or Texas, whence slaves were smuggled into the 
southern States. The increased prices of slaves, owing to the 
risk attaching to the business and to the demand in the 
cotton-fields, proved an irresistible attraction to American ° 
capital, and much was invested in the trade. In 1815 the 
average value of all slaves dependent on cotton culture was 
$250; in 1840 it was estimated by De Bow at $500. Slavery 
had now become more than ever localized in the South. 
In 1820 only 19,108 of the 1,538,038 slaves in the United 
States lived north of Mason and Dixon’s line; in 1840 only 
1129 out of 2,487,355 were to be found there. The total 
number of slaves showed an increase in almost the same 
proportion as the white population, and this in spite of the 
large additions to the latter by immigration. 
Towards the end of this period, in 1831, the anti-slavery 
movement began in the North and continued until slavery 
was done away with during the Civil War. ‘There was, 
however, a strong anti-abolition spirit still to be found there, 
while Congress remained distinctly neutral or even friendly 
to the slave interests, as indicated by the “ gag resolutions ” 
which tabled without further action all anti-slavery petitions 
presented to Congress. About 1838 a change in sentiment 
towards slavery began in the North, but it did not gather 
strength until after 1840. 
56. Effect on the West.— We have already seen some- 
thing of the great increase in commerce on the western rivers 
after 1816. It was the opening up of the Southwest, with its 
one-sided single-crop cultivation, that provided an outlet for
-P-A-G-E-78
66 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
the surplus agricultural produce of the West and thus per- 
mitted the development of this section as well. So great was 
the inclination of the cotton planters to confine themselves to 
their staple crop that other products were entirely neglected, 
-and instead of being raised at home were purchased from the 
agricultural States of the Northwest with the proceeds of the 
cotton crop. Corn, flour, bacon, hams, lard, and live stock, 
with a hundred other articles of minor importance, were 
* floated down the Ohio and Mississippi rivers and found a 
ready market in the southern States. The following table 
shows the fluctuations in the amount of a few products arriving 
in New Orleans: :

An estimate of 1845, given by Ingle, was that in twenty 
years southern planters had spent $900,000,000 in neighbor- 
ing States for mules, horses, implements, and clothing, an 
expenditure made necessary because they had employed all 
their labor and land in producing staple crops. 
57. Effect upon the East.— The effects of the extension 
of cotton culture and the consequent creation of an important 
new market was felt in the East as well as in the Northwest. 
The growing manufactures of this section found a ready sale 
among the population west of the Alleghanies. There had 
thus developed a sectional or territorial division of labor, by 
which the South produced raw materials (mainly for export), 
  ‘
-P-A-G-E-79
  THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT \ 67 
the Northwest-raised-the-food-supplies,-and-the East devoted 
itself to manufactures. The trade in each case, however, was 
a one-sided one and did not lead to close economic inter- 
dependence; the East sold to the West but did not buy from 
it, the West sold to the South, and the South exported three 
fourths of its crop to England. Some indication has already 
been given of the large and remunerative internal trade which 
resulted from the exchange of these goods. An enormous 
stimulus was given to the commercial interests of the country 
and new opportunities were open to the merclrant, importer, 
ship-owner, banker, insurance company, and middlemen in 
general, most of whom were located in the eastern States. 
The growth of manufactures has been described, but it 
is impossible to give any adequate picture of the develop- 
‘ment of the commercial class at this period. According to an 
estimate by Seaman, in 1840 there were 188,000 persons 
engaged in commerce and navigation employing a capital of 
$430,000,000. 
SUGGESTIVE TOPICS AND QUESTIONS. CHAPTER IV 
The pioneer settlers who moved west had several problems to meet 
in their new adventure: by what route, by what sort of conveyance, 
* to what section should they go. Once arrived at their destination they 
faced new problems of adjustment, of production, of finding a market 
for their surplus products, and of obtaining for themselves the manu- 
factured goods of more advanced sections. 
1. Is Bishop Berkeley’s saying, “ Westward the course of empire 
takes its way,” true of the United States? 
2. “The true point of view in the history of this nation is not the

occupies its important place in American history because of its. relation 
to westward expansion.” Do you agree with this? [F. J. Turner, The

PUBLIC LANDS AND AGRICULTURE (1808-1860) 
58. Importance of the public lands. — It is almost impos- 
sible to exaggerate the influence which the vast western ex- 
panse of cheap land‘has had upon the economic history of the 
United States. In the later days of the Confederation and 
the early days.of the Republic it bound together by economic 
interests the States at a time when they otherwise would have 
drifted apart. Later it afforded an outlet for a growing popu- 
lation, which, instead of becoming denser, has spent its force 
in taking up new territory. The problem of over-population 
—that bogy of the early nineteenth century in England — 
had no meaning in a country where an increase of hands was 
the greatest need. Unemployment, the standard of living, 
and the rate of wages were all solved by a recourse to the open 
land of the West, while the problem of immigration was 
mainly that of inducing foreigners to come to our shores. This 
abundance of land has greatly simplified economic and social 
problems and has acted as a safety-valve in times of depres- 
sion and panic. 
59. Disposal of the land for settlement.— The early 
policy of the government, of land sales for the sake of revenue, 
gradually gave way to the second, and what has proved to be: 
the permanent, policy respecting the public lands. This is 
the system of land grants for actual settlement in small lots 
suitable for cultivation.. By the act of April, 1820, sale for 
credit was abandoned and the price reduced to $1.25 an acre 
while the minimum tract to be sold to one individual was 
reduced to eighty acres. The earlier system had been de- 
nounced by western men, who objected to the use of the public

domain as a source of government revenue, to the high price 
of the land, and to the credit system. Representatives of the 
eastern states, on the other hand, had resisted any change in 
these provisions, as they feared the reduction of land values 
in the East because of the competition of the abundant lands 
in the West, and claimed that a reduction of price would drain 
off the population from the seaboard and cause a rise of wages 
in the manufacturing states: Each view was seen to be 
exaggerated. ‘ : 
For the next ten years the sales of public land were very 
steady, averaging about 1,000,000 acres yearly. The introduc-

“After the crop is cut, the swath is collected by the hand and tied into 
sheaves; a small quantity of stalks still remain scattered over the sur- 
face; these are commonly collected by the hand rake. To facilitate the

tion of the steamboat upon western waters, the extension of 
cotton culture through the Southwest, the greater demand for 
agricultural produce due to the growth in population, all led 
to a steady demand for land for actual cultivation and settle- 
ment. The possibility of using the public lands as an agency 
of social reform gradually dawned upon the workingmen, and 
they began to demand, in their papers and conventions, that - 
speculation should stop and the public domain be opened to 
the people. Land reform became an important issue in the 
platforms of organized labor. During the years from 1825 
to 1832 many schemes of a most questionable character were 
introduced in Congress for disposing of the lands by sale or

gift, for reducing the price, or for handing over the public 
lands to the States for them to dispose of. 
60. Speculation in western lands.— The next few years 
saw an outburst of speculative activity which has scarcely 
been equaled since in the United States. This was largely 
owing to the great increase in land values, the inflated con- 
dition of the currency, and the loose banking methods then 
prevailing. Western lands had been steadily appreciating in 
value for some years, and as credit and money became easier 
under the speculative fever of the time, they seemed a favor- 
able object of investment to those who were seeking an easy 
and rapid increase of wealth. Paper villages were laid out, 
lands were sold at greatly enhanced prices, often fifty times 
their original cost, and speculation was fanned to a fever heat. 
The sales of public lands swelled rapidly, amounting to 
3,856,278 acres for the year 1833, and to the enormous figure 
of 20,074,871 acres for 1836. The sales of 1834-36, 40,000,000 
acres, exceeded all that had been sold before. Nor was the 
speculation confined to western lands; owing to the extension 
of cotton culture due to the increasing demand for, and the 
consequent advance in the price of, cotton—from a maxi- 
mum of 134 cents a pound in 1833 to 20 cents in 1835 — the 
value of southern plantations and city real estate rose enor- 
mously. The coal lands of Pennsylvania and the manu- 
facturing cities of the East felt a similar impetus. Thus 
the assessed value of real estate in New York city rose from 
$143,732,425 in 1835 to $223,742,303 in 1836, and in Mobile 
from $4,000,000 in 1834 to $27,000,000 in 1837. After the 
panic of 1837 these values fell even more rapidly. 
61. Pre-emption of the public lands. — The rapid peopling 
of the West and the settlement of the public domain made 
necessary a better method of disposing of the land to actual 
settlers than had prevailed. Under the previous system of 
sales many of the most desirable tracts were bought and held 
by speculators or for investment. As the incoming popula- 
tion pressed in, it tended in its haste to pass beyond the sur-

veyed lands and to settle in the wilds before they had been 
opened to settlement. The public domain was theoretically 
not open to settlement until it had been surveyed and was 
offered for sale through land offices; as a matter of fact the 
pioneers did not wait for government surveys, but “ squatted ” 
on the land. For the benefit of those already upon the soil 
and of future residents the pre-emption system was gradually 
developed. “Pre-emption is a premium in favor of, and 
  HarvEsTING WITH CRADLES 
In most parts of America the crops were mowed at this time by the 
cradle scythe. This was a frame of wood with a row of long curved 
ribs projecting above and parallel to a-broad scythe-blade, for cutting 
grains and laying them in a straight swath. The cradle acted as a 
gathering rake and deposited the grain in an even pile with every 
swing of the scythe. It was invented in 1803 and constituted at the 
time a greater improvement over existing methods than did the reaper

condition for, making permanent settlement and a home.” 
“The essential conditions of pre-emption are actual entry 
upon, residence in a dwelling, and improvement and culti- 
vation of a tract of land.” It was not a free grant of land, 
but simply a privilege to the settler of purchasing at the

established price the land upon which he had settled, without 
competition of any sort. The first, general pre-emption act 
was passed in 1830 as a temporary measure and was con- 
tinued each year until superseded by the permanent law of 
1841.. The policy of disposing of the public lands primarily 
for homes had now been definitely adopted. Except during 
the panic of 1857, the sales during this period were steady and 
kept pace with the settling of the West, averaging about three 
and one half millions acres a year. 
62. Grants of land. — In addition to its use for purposes 
of settlement, the public domain of the United States has also 
been employed to encourage internal improvements, for edu- 
cational purposes, and in direct gifts to individuals and States. 
By the ordinance of 1785 it was provided that one thirty- 
sixth of the public lands should be reserved for the support 
of the common schools, and since 1848 one eighteenth has been 
so reserved in all States entering the Union after that date. 
Beginning with 1841, the lands were recklessly alienated by 
Congress; during the period 1841-60, 65,701,312 acres were 
granted to individuals, 105,131,877 acres were granted to 
States for purposes other than internal improvements, of 
which the largest single gift was that in 1849 of all the “swamp 
and overflowed lands” within the limits of any State; and 
29,820,337 acres were granted to States and corporations for 
internal improvements. Of a total of 269,406,415 acres dis- 
posed of during the period 1840 to 1860, only 68,752,889 acres 
were sold, the rest being cate improvidently — 
given away by Congress. 
63. Extension of farm area.— The sets of the 
fertile country about the Great Lakes proceeded rapidly after 
the construction of the Erie and other canals had provided an 
outlet to the Atlantic ports for western produce. Between 
1820 and 1840 the population of Ohio increased from 581,295 
to 1,519,467; that of Indiana from 147,178 to 685,866; of 
Illinois, from 55,211 to 476,183; and of Michigan, from 8896 
to 212,267. This growth in the population denotes a cor-

responding extension in the cultivated farm area, though 
statistics showing this were not yet gathered for the census. 
While some of those who joined in the westward movement 
took up land for speculative purposes, the majority had the 
distinct purpose of becoming farmers. During this period 
the tide of settlement pushed out beyond the forest belt, 
which clothed the whole eastern section as far as Ohio and 
which made the task of the settler in that region so laborious, 
and reached the treeless prairies of the West. The cost of 
preparing the soil for cultivation here was certainly less than 
  “The plow is different in its construction from that used in Germany, 
and the oxen are attached to it by a very peculiar yoke, which consists 
of a long, thick, crooked piece of wood, which is laid horizontally over 
the necks of two oxen, with two bows underneath, through which the 
heads of the animals are put.” Travels in the Interior of North Amer- 
ica, by Maximilian, Prince of Wied, 1832. 
half what it had been in those sections where the forest had 
first to be cleared away. “ Here,” wrote an English traveler, 
Stirling, “the pioneer is not the backwoodsman with his axe, 
but the ‘ prairie-breaker’ with his team and plough.” Yet 
there were certain obstacles to the rapid settlement of this
-P-A-G-E-89
  PUBLIC LANDS AND AGRICULTURE Te 
open land: the scarcity of wood made it difficult to build 
houses or to secure fuel, while drinking water could be ob- 
tained only by digging wells from twenty to forty feet, and 
was not very good at that. The lack of navigable water- 
ways, too, cut off the settlers on the prairie from access to 
markets, at least until the railway: opened up this section. 
As a result the early pioneer was apt to lead an isolated and 
dreary existence, which was aggravated by the unhealthfulness 
of the region. 
The population of the southern slave States also increased 
from 1,200,484 in 1820 to 2,659,085 in 1840, although most 
of the increase took place in the new Southwest rather than in 
the old South. The cotton and sugar plantations of the South 
showed an increase in size after 1840; here alone, with the 
exception of California, was to be found any considerable 
number of farms of over 1000 acres. The total values pro- 
duced on the farms at each decennial date was estimated at 
$580,000,000 in 1840, $800,000,000 in 1850, and $1,250,000,- 
000 in 1860. In spite of the rapid progress in manufactures 
and commerce, the country still remained predominantly 
agricultural, over 40 per cent. of the population being depend- 
ent upon agriculture. 
64. Improvements in farm implements. — As late as 1830 
practically every part of the work of the farm, says Professor 
Carver, except plowing, harrowing, and drawing loads, was 
‘done by hand, that is, with tools that were directed and driven 
by human muscles. “Small grain was sown broadcast, reaped 
with a cradle (which was a relatively new invention), and 
threshed with a flail, or trodden out by horses and oxen. Hay 
was mown with a scythe, and raked and pitched by hand. 
Corn was planted and covered by hand, and cultivated mainly 
with a hoe.” Using a cradle and a hand-rake a man could cut 
and rake about two acres a day, working under much greater 
fatigue than a modern farmer endures. 
By 1860 the farming industry had been revolutionized in 
respect of practically every one of these processes by the in-
-P-A-G-E-90
  78 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
vention and introduction of farm machinery whose motive 
power was non-human. No period of equal length in the his- 
tory of agriculture has witnessed such revolutionary changes. 
Of far-reaching influence on the extension of cereal produc- 
tion throughout the flat prairie regions of the central West 
was the invention of various mechanical devices for plowing, 
cultivating, mowing, reaping, and threshing the crops. The 
cast-iron: plow was in general use by 1825. During the next 
decade the use of threshing machines spread with great rapid- 
ity, and by 1840 comparatively little grain was threshed in 
any other way. Improvements continued to be invented: 
up to 1860 the number of patents — 354 — granted for thresh- 
ing machines was larger than had been issued for any other 
instrument except the plow and water-wheel, and perhaps 
grain harvesters and corn-planters. At first the machine 
merely threshed, but about 1850 separators were added, which 
separated the grain from the chaff and straw. By 1860 steam- 
threshers had been introduced, but horse power was still gener- 
ally used. The first patent for a mowing machine was granted 
to William Manning, of New Jersey, in 1831, and for a reaping 
machine to Obed Hussey, of Baltimore, in 1833, which cut 
grain as fast as eight persons could bind it. In 1834 a patent 
was issued to Cyrus H. McCormick for an improved reaping 
machine for cutting grains of all kinds. The prototype of the 
revolving hay-rake was invented in 1824 and perfected about 
1856. Only limited success attended the early introduction of 
these machines, and it was not until after 1840 that they 
exerted their transforming influence on western agriculture. 
The common use of the reaper dates from about 1845, and 
the mower a decade later. It was given a great impetus by 
the success of American machines at the World’s Fair in 
London in 1851 and at an exhibition near Paris four years 
later. “The triumph of the American reapers,” said the 
official report. at London, “ worked a new era in agriculture.” 
At the Paris exhibition a trial of mowing, reaping, and thresh- 
ing machines was made, and of the results a correspondent of

the New York Tribune wrote: “ Six men were set to threshing 
with flails at the same moment that the different machines 
commenced operations, and the following were the results of 
half an hour’s work:

410 liters of wheat

    In the trial of reapers the following was the result in a 
field of oats: an Algerian machine cut an acre in 72 minutes; 
an English machine in 66 minutes; and an American in 22 
minutes. 
65. Other improvements.— The application of machinery 
to the work of harvesting marked an epoch in American 
agriculture; there was now no practical limit to production 
through inability to gather the crop. But the use of machines 
in harvesting was supple- 
mented, though in a lesser 
degree, by their applica- 
tion to the cultivation and 
tillage of the crop, par- 
ticularly of Indian corn. 
A variety of cultivators,

seed-drills, and similar 
implements enabled the T ; 4 s : 3 he plain springless box wagon was in-

mal power for hand cul- 
ture. Of especial importance were the corn-planters and the 
two-horse cultivator, which came into use during this period. 
In a new country like the United States, where labor was still 
scarce and high, labor-saving machines were indispensable. 
The chief characteristics of the American machines, were, as 
they still are, lightness, simplicity, and cheapness, in all of

which qualities they far excelled those of England ana Europe. 
By 1860 the total value of agricultural implements manufac- 
tured in the United States was $17,802,514. 
During this period, too, commercial fertilizers were intro- 
duced into the United States, and the application of chemistry 
to agriculture, first re- 
duced to a science by 
Liebig, was put in prac- 
tice, though as yet toa

able progress was made 
during this period by the western States (Ohio, Indiana, 
Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin). In these five States be- 
tween 1850 and 1860 the number of miles of railroad grew 
from 1275 to 9616; the production of corn, oats, and cattle 
increased over 50 per ‘cent., and of wheat and potatoes 100 
per cent. At the same 7

railroads. 
66. Benefits of farm machinery.— The saving effected 
by the use of these improved implements was estimated in the 
census of 1860 as equal to more than one half the former cost 
of working. “ By the improved plow, labor equivalent to that

of one horse in three is saved. By means of drills two bushels 
of seed will go as far as three bushels scattered broadcast, 
while the yield is increased six to eight bushels per acre; the 
plants come up in rows and may be tended by horse-hoes. 
. . . The reaping machine is a saving of more than one third 
the labor when it cuts and rakes. . . . The threshing machine 
is a saving of two thirds on the old hand-flail mode. . .°. 
The saving in the labor of : 
handling hay in the field 
and barn by means of horse- 
rakes and horse-hayforks is 
equal to one half.” But the 
real gain to agriculture by 
the use of these machines 
cannot be measured merely 
by noting the increased area 
that can be cultivated by a S a 5 , 
given labor force, or the troduced over the two wiles saving in labor cost. It con- 
sists rather in the saving of time, which permits a large 
crop to be harvested at the.moment of maturity, without 
the loss by delay or exposure, that is, if grain is not harvested — 
in about ten days it is lost, falls to the ground or is spoiled. 
The whole labor force of the United States in 1860 would 
probably have been insufficient to have harvested in season 
the crops of that year by the methods of a generation 
previous. 
The expansion that was taking place in agriculture during 
this period can best be seen in the following table. During 
the twenty-year period, 1840-1860, there was a round doub- 
ling in the case of most of the products, but cotton somewhat 
more than trebled, while oats and potatoes showed only about 
a fifty per cent growth. On the whole the expansion of agri- 
cultural production was more rapid than the growth either of 
the population or the means of transportation; it measured 
fairly well the development of wealth.

67. Cereal production. — With the extension of the culti- 
vated area the production of the cereals increased enormously; 
most of it, however, found a market in the growing South- 
west, and the lake grain trade did not begin to expand until 
the end of this period. As corn could not pay the costs of 
transportation very well, it was converted into whisky or hogs, 
and sold in the form of salt pork, hams, bacon, etc. Some 
cattle were fattened on corn and driven over the mountains to 
the Atlantic seaboard. With the opening of the Erie Canal in 
» 1825, an outlet was afforded to the grain of the West. Wheat 
began to displace corn as the chief money crop of the northern 
lake region, and became the breadstuff of the northern popu- 
lation. The center of wheat production was still in western 
New York, however, and its export from the West did not 
become important until after the building of railroads. Corn 
and live stuck remained the principal products of the Ohio 
valley, and were shipped down the Mississippi to the cotton 
plantations of the South. In 1840, when this crop first 
appeared in the census, the production of Indian corn 
amounted to 377,531,875 bushels, and of wheat to 84,823,272 
bushels.

68. Changes in farming.—One of the effects of all these 
improvements in harvesting and marketing the crops was a 
greater specialization in farming. There was a general change 
from the self-sufficing system of agriculture, where a farmer 
produces everything that he needs, to the commercial system, 
where he specializes on a money crop and buys most of his 
supplies with the proceeds. The transfer of grain production

value from $3,000,000 in 1840 to $35,800,000 in 1860. On 
the western farms there was greater specialization in cereal 
production, which permitted the use of more expensive ma- 
chinery and more capital. 
69. The grain trade of the United States. — Until the 
building of railroads in the western States the grain trade de- 
veloped very slowly. With the completion of the system of 
canals and later of railroads, the grain resources of the lake 
basin were opened up and the trade greatly stimulated. As 
late as 1835 Ohio was the only State in the West exporting 
grain direct to the Atlantic coast. The first shipments of 
grain from Chicago consisted of 78 bushels of wheat in 1838, 
while the first shipment from Wisconsin was not made until 
three years later. By 1860 the total shipments of grain and 
flour eastward from ports on Lake Michigan alone amounted 
' to 43,211,448 bushels. During the period 1840-60 the pro- 
duction of grain in the northwestern States was estimated 
to have increased from 218,463,583 to 642,120,366 bushels. 
Of this, however, only a very small portion was exported; 
on an average not over 10 per cent. The following census 
table shows the increase in value of the grain exports:

Great as this increase was in the last two decades, especially 
after the repeal of the British corn laws in 1846, the produce 
of a single State like Illinois far exceeded the total exports. 
The real development of the export grain trade belongs to the 
next period. Practically all of the exports were now made via

the Atlantic ports, the New Orleans grain trade having en- 
tirely disappeared; in 1860 only 2189 bushels of wheat were 
shipped from that port. On the other hand, the southern 
exports of cotton — which constituted about one half of our 
total exports in value— and of sugar, tobacco, and rice had 
grown prodigiously. 
70. Home consumption of products. — It is evident that 
when only 4 per cent. of the cereal production of the country, 
or 40,000,000 bushels of grain out of a total crop of 1,000- 
000,000 bushels, is exported, the home market is infinitely 
more important than the foreign. And yet the greatest interest 
has always properly enough attached to the export trade, 
for the price at home of wheat, cotton, and other agricultural 
exports has been determined by the price ruling in Europe, 
and more particularlyin England. The vast growth of manu- 
factures in the eastern States created a demand in that section 
for western produce; in 1863 Governor Andrew of Massachu- 
setts estimated that the consumption of western agricultural 
products in New England amounted to $50,000,000 yearly. 
On the other hand, the devotion in the southern States to 
the cultivation of a few staple crops — cotton, tobacco, sugar, 
and rice — created profitable home markets for the grain of 
the Northwest. Much of the corn, too, was not consumed as 
such, but was fed to stock, especially swine, which were then 
more easily marketed than the original product. The increase 
in the tonnage of the lakes, from 76,000 tons in 1845 to 391,220 
in 1860, and of railroad mileage, from, 2818 miles in 1840 to 
30,635 in 1860, sufficiently indicates the growth of the internal 
trade of the country. 
In explaining the progress and prosperity of agriculture 
during this period due emphasis must be placed upon the 
widening markets as well as upon the improvements in pro- 
duction. Not only was the domestic market expanding, but 
there was a growing foreign demand for our products, due to 
famine and wars abroad, the repeal of the English corn laws, 
and the growth of industry in that country and in Europe.  
-P-A-G-E-98
86 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
71. Cotton growing.— One of the most important events 
in the agricultural history of this period was the rise of cotton 
to first place amiong the products of the South. It passed 
tobacco in 1803 and has ever since led all other southern 
agricultural staples. In other chapters is discussed the rela- 
tion of cotton culture to slavery; it is sufficient at this place 
to mention that it was carried on largely by negro slaves, and 
that by this very fact agriculture in the South was reduced 
to a condition of stagnation. The wasteful system of land 
killing was practised even more extensively in the cultivation 
of cotton than in the case of the cereals; one piece of land 
was cultivated continuously until it was exhausted, when 
it was’ abandoned and a new tract cleared. As the slaves 
could be trusted only with heavy and crude tools, the intro- 
duction of improved agricultural machinery in southern 
agriculture was rendered impossible. The use of slaves in 
cotton culture had also the effect of concentrating the industry 
on large plantations rather than of scattering it over small 
farms. In all these respects therefore — the crop itself, the 
kind of labor, the character of ‘the tools, and the size of the 
farm holding — there was a great difference between agri- 
culture in the South and that in the North. Those sections 
of the South which were not able to produce cotton were 
devoted to the raising of other staples which found a ready 
market in the other sections of the country. Tobacco was 
cultivated in the northern tier of slave States, and by much 
the same methods that had prevailed during the colonial 
period. In Virginia and Kentucky there also grew up a con- 
siderable stock-raising industry, especially of horses and 
mules, for which there: was a strong demand on the cotton 
plantations. ; 
72. Live stock. — The cattle industry of the United States 
has always flourished on the frontier, and during this period 
made steady progress in the West. The first fat cattle that 
ever crossed the Alleghanies were driven from Ohio to Balti- 
more in the spring of 1805. This proved the beginning of a

  PUBLIC LANDS AND AGRICULTURE 87 
profitable trade, and until the railroad began to transport 
them directly to the eastern market, western cattle were 
fattened on corn in Ohio during the winter months and then 
driven eastward in the’ 
spring. About 1832-36 a 
general interest in the im- 
provement of live stock be- 
gan to be manifested by 
farmers, largely as a result 
of the exhibitions at county 
fairs which had begun 
about 1810, but were now : The southern pine-woods hog, which revived and improved. jyanged wild in the woods at all sea- Durhams, long-horns, sons, developed fleetness of foot, Herefords, Devons, and conte, large bones, and a thick, hard

to Baltimore and Philadelphia to be slaughtered there for 
the domestic and foreign provision trade; later Cincinnati 
became the center of the meat-packing industry and remained 
so until displaced, in 1861, by Chicago. 
73. Other Changes.— A notable event was the importa- 
tion into Ohio of the Percheron stallion Louis Napoleon, from 
which dates a great improvement in the draft horse. Before 
this the most prized animals as beasts of burden, in addition 
to mules, were the Conestoga horses, which were early used to 
draw the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh stage coach. Some attention 
had been given to breeding trotting horses and _ several 
importations made; a great sensation had been occasioned 
in 1816 when “ Yankey” trotted a mile under the saddle 
at the Harlem course in New York City in 2.59, but religious 
sentiment in the North was against speed tests. Trotting did 
not become a popilar pastime until after the introduction of 
macadam pavements. Up to 1840 the buggy was practically 
unknown, the common mode of travel being on horseback.
-P-A-G-E-101

An interesting change was taking place at this time in the 
kind of animal power used on the farm. As long as crude and 
heavy implements were used, such as the old bull-plow, the 
cart, and the clumsy wooden harrow, oxen were generally 
used, as they were powerful and cheap. With the introduction 
of farm machinery, however, these slow and stupid animals 
were displaced by horses and mules, which were better adapted 
to this purpose. 
Between 1840 and 1860 the number of sheep remained 
almost at a standstill, while the increase in neat cattle and 
swine did not keep pace with the growth of the population. 
‘All of these animals were raised chiefly for slaughtering. 
While the pork-packing industry did not assume large pro- 
portions until the decade of the Civil War, in 1860 over 400,- 
000 hogs were slaughtered annually at Cincinnati, and 
230,000 at Chicago; the following year Chicago took first 
place. An improvement was introduced into the dairying 
business during this period, which in time worked a revolution 
in that branch of farm work. Up to 1850 all the butter and 
cheese was made on the farm, but in the next year the associ- 
ated system of dairying known as the American system was 
inaugurated by the invention of the cheese-factory, of which 
twenty-one were built by 1861. The development of dairying 
led to attempts to improve the breeds of dairy cattle, and a 
large number of pure-bred Jerseys were imported and also 
some Ayrshires.

  90 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
74. Condition of the farmer.— The economic position 
of the American farmer during this period was one of increas- 
ing prosperity, interrupted only temporarily by banking 
troubles, by panics, or by crop failures. The building of 
internal improvements was furnishing sections of the country 
with better means of transportation and affording access 
to markets. The spread of cotton culture brought in large 
profits to southern planters and provided an outlet for northern 
produce, while the growth of manufactures contributed also 
to the development of a home market. The life of the settlers 
in the new West was not very different from that of the early 
colonists in the eastern States. A rude abundance of the 
necessaries of life was everywhere to be found, and a gener- 
ous hospitality was remarked by travelers as a characteristic 
of the people. Breadstuffs — wheat and corn — were plenti- 
ful and cheap. Game was abundant, and cattle and hogs 
multiplied rapidly and foraged for themselves in the woods, 
* so that animal food was a usual article of diet. The settler’s 
garden furnished him all the vegetables necessary for his 
table, with little attention on his part; there was usually a 
superfluity of potatoes, squashes, melons, and other common 
vegetables. Tomatoes, curiously enough, were grown as orna- 
mental shrubs under the name of “love apples,” but were 
not eaten until about 1830, as they were generally supposed 
to be poisonous. Apples, peaches, pears, and other fruits were 
fairly plentiful, but were of poor quality. Salt and iron alone 
| were scarce, and, in the prairie region, wood; elsewhere it was 
1 Mrs. Trollope, in her Domestic Manners of the Americans, writes as 
follows of her experience in Ohio: “ All the fruit I saw exposed for 
sale in Cincinnati was most miserable. I passed two summers there, 
but never tasted a peach worth eating. Of apricots and nectarines I 
saw none; strawberries very small, raspberries much worse; goose- 
berries very few and quite uneatable; currants about half the size of 
ours, and about double the price; grapes too sour for tarts; apples 
abundant, but very indifferent; none that would be thought good 
enough for an English table; pears, cherries, and plums, most miserably 
bad.”

abundant. Clothing was of homespun, and in the outlying 
districts often of leather and skins. Where the population 
was dispersed, the life of the settler was often lonely and 
marred by the prevalent malaria. But these were temporary 
hardships, to be endured for the sake of the certain increase 
in the value of the land and the satisfaction of being one’s 
own master. 
75. Character of agriculture.— American farming was 
still characterized by the wasteful and exhausting methods of 
cropping without fertilizing that prevailed in colonial times. 
This was caused: partly by the fertility of the soil and the 
abundance of cheap land, and partly by the unsettled nature 
of farming and the unwillingness to sink capital in improve- 
ments. “It seldom happens,” wrote Tocqueville in 1840, 
“that an American farmer settles for good upon the land which 
he occupies; especially in districts of the far West he brings 
land into tillage in order to sell it again and not to farm it.” 
The same thing was remarked by another traveler: + “ There 
. is scarcely any such thing in New England and New York as 
local attachment . . . Speaking generally, every farm, from 
Eastport in Maine to Buffalo on Lake Erie, is for sale. The 
owner has already fixed a price in his mind for which he would 
be willing and even hopes to sell, believing that with the 
same money he could do better for himself and his family by 
going still farther West. Thus, to lay out money in improve- 
ments is actually to bury what he does not hope to be able 
to get out of his farm again, when the opportunity for selling 
presents itself.” So long as land was held only as a specula- 
tion, in order to sell again, farming could not be brought to 
a very high state .of development. The American farmer 
of this period has been likened to a miner, who extracts 
wealth from the soil, but does not restore it. Such methods 
were directly promoted by the prevailing practice in regard 
to land holding and sale, which made the farmer, in part at 
least, a speculator as well as an agriculturist. American agri-

culture has suffered from this fact down to the present time. 
For the farmer of that time, however, this was the most 
economical method, since capital and labor were scarce while 
land was plentiful and could therefore be used wastefully. 
SUGGESTIVE TOPICS AND QUESTIONS. CHAPTER V 
The land problem, in its governmental aspect, was how to get the 
public lands into the hands of settlers; in its social aspect, it was 
how to utilize the land so as to produce the largest returns, The 
response of the American farmer to this problem was prompt and may 
be read in the agricultural development of this period.

CHAPTER VI 
SLAVERY AND THE SOUTH 
76. The development of the South.— While the country 
as a whole had made marvelous industrial progress during 
this period, the benefits were confined largely to the North 
and West. The great advances in manufactures, in agricul- 
tural improvements, and in commerce had scarcely affected 
the South. The reason for this industrial backwardness was 
the specialization in cotton growing, which was bound up 
with the institution of slavery, and to a fuller discussion 
of slavery as a system of labor we must now turn. Two 
thirds of the population and a still greater proportion of the 
wealth of the country were in the northern States in 1860. 
Of the $3,736,000,000 of wealth produced in 1859, over 
$2,818,000,000 came from northern farms and factories. By 
far the greater part of the manufacturing and mining indus- 
tries of the country were situated there. In fact, the South 
had lagged far behind the North in the industrial advance of 
the previous half century. A southern writer, Trenholm, 
has the following to say on this point: “The whirl and rush 
of this progress encompassed the South on every side... . 
Yet alone in all the world she stood unmoved by it; in 
government, in society, in employment, in labor, the States 
of the South, in 1860, were substantially what they had been 
in 1810, when the abolition of the slave-trade had impressed 
upon their development the last modification of form of which 
it seemed susceptible.” 
77. The growth of slavery. — With the increased demand 
for cotton, the cotton belt had gradually spread westward 
until in 1860 it stretched from the Atlantic across the southern 
95

States and over the greater part of Texas. At the same time 
the production of cotton had almost trebled between 1840 
and 1860. Hand in hand with this extension of cotton terri- 
  Corron PickInG 
Cotton picking began about the first 
of August in the eastern States and 
continued until the middle of Decem- 
ber in the West. The field had to be 
gone over again and again, as only 
the ripened blooms were picked each 
time. This was a tedious but not 
laborious task and employed women 
and children as weil as men. An 
average hand would pick about 200 
Ibs. a day, while some skilled pickers 
potted as high as 400 or 500 lbs. a 
lay. 
  tory and of production had 
proceeded the growth in the 
number of slaves, from 
677,897 in 1790 to 2,009,043 
in 1830, and 3,953,760 in 
1860. How dependent the 
extension of slavery was 
upon the growth of cotton 
can easily be seen by not- 
ing the concentration of 
slaves in the cotton-grow- 
ing States. In 1840 over 
two thirds of the slave 
population were in the 
ten cotton-growing States, 
while in 1860 nearly three 
fourths were to be found 
there. Of this large num- 
ber a considerable propor- 
tion had been added by 
an illicit slave-trade with 
Africa, but the greater part 
{was the natural increase 
of the slave population. 
Slaves were exported 
mainly from the border 
States of Virginia, Mary- 
land, and Kentucky, where 
there was diminishing op- 
portunity for negro employment, resulting in a vigorous slave- 
trade with the cotton-growing States. Olmstead calculates that 
the average importation of slaves into seven of the southern 
States during the decade 1850-1860 was about 25,000 annually.
-P-A-G-E-109
  SLAVERY AND THE SOUTH 97 
78. Nature of slavery.— Slavery is essentially a system 
of forced labor; the worker does not reap the reward of his 
toil and is consequently less interested in its results. Under a 
system of free labor the full returns of his effort belong to the 
laborer; the motive to exertion is self-interest instead of fear, 
and consequently the diligence and application are many 
times greater. On the other hand, the whole fruit of the 
slave’s toil belonged to his master, who had to make in return 
only a small outlay for maintenance. How far the small 
running expenses offset the meager returns from slave labor 
was the economic problem involved in the system of slavery. 
Was it more remunerative to the slave-owning population than 
a system of free hired labor, quite irrespective of the rights or 
interests of the slaves? Southern writers before the Civil 
War insisted that the prosperity of the South was bound up 
in the “ peculiar institution,” and that to destroy slavery was 
to ruin southern industry; as a matter of fact, nearly nine 
tenths of the cotton was raised by slave labor: It may fairly 
be admitted that by 1850 the question of free versus slave 
labor was no longer a debatable one. The existence of slavery 
and the plantation system had driven out the supply of white 
yeomen labor which might have done the work of raising 
cotton, and the plantation owners were unable to make use 
of any other than slave labor. When the gin was invented 
cotton was generally raised by white farmers. As its culture 
spread out to the richer lands of Alabama and Mississippi 
the large plantation with slave labor competed successfully 
with the small farm and finally supplanted it. The independ- 
ent white farmer then retreated to the poorer lands, where 
he grew some cotton, raised live stock, or engaged in mixed 
farming. If there had been no slaves white labor would have 
developed the cotton industry pireuetoue the South, though 
of course more slowly.

the production of a staple commodity for sale. On a typical 
farm the laboring force would be small, the production would 
not be subject to regular routine, and the commodities might 
be raised for home consumption. “The plantation: system 
was evolved,” says Phillips, ‘to answer the specific need of

farming were seldom possible under the indifferent and waste- 
ful slave system. Consequently, the colonial method was 
persisted in, of cropping a piece of land until it was exhausted 
and then moving on to a fresh piece. Such a system required 
practically unlimited quantities of new and fertile lands; the 
need of new lands for cotton growing was indeed an important 
factor in the effort to widen our boundaries by the inclusion 
of Texas, Mexico, and the lands to the southwest. This 
method involved at once an enormous waste of natural re- 
sources and a rapid exhaustion of the soil. In every southern 
State there were enormous tracts of exhausted and abandoned 
cotton lands; in fact the uncultivated land far exceeded the 
cultivated. The following table+ shows the difference in this 
respect between the different parts of the country:

80. King Cotton.— There was, as we have seen, a grow- 
ing concentration in the South upon the cultivation of cotton. 
For twenty-five years the price of cotton had been pretty 
steadily falling, until it reached less than six cents a pound 
in 1845; the advance to nearly fourteen cents in 1857, 
occasioned by the expansion of manufactures in England 
after the tariff reforms of 1842-46 and the development of 
cotton manufacturing in France, greatly stimulated its cul-

tivation. In the decade 1850-60 the production per inhabit- 
ant in the southern States of every important cereal product, 
of cattle and swine, and even of the products peculiar to the 
slave States, as flax, rice, and sugar, fell off absolutely, 
while in the production of tobacco the increase was relatively 
less than in the northern States. In the case of cotton alone 
there was a relative as well as an absolute gain; it more than 
trebled in the twenty years, from 1,500,000 bales in 1840 to 
5,300,000 in 1860. It is evident that almost the entire labor 
force and capital of the South were being directed into the one 
channel, the production of cotton. In 1820 the production 
of cotton had equaled 109 pounds to each slave; by 1853 it 
was 337 pounds per slave. These figures show a great con- 
centration of slave labor upon cotton growing. There was 
indeed truth in the statement so often made, that “Cotton 
is King.” Seven eighths of the world’s supply of that staple 
was grown in the South. The expanding economic demand 
for the one staple’which could be grown under slavery caused 
an extension of the slave system and entrenched it still further. 
This, in turn, had yet other consequences of great influence 
upon the South. 
81. Advantages of slave labor.— There were certain sur- 
face advantages in a system of slavery. After his original 
investment, the slave-holder paid only the cost of maintaining 
his slaves and then possessed himself of their entire output. 
As a result of his absolute control over -his slaves, the owner 
could direct, organize, combine, and move them as he saw fit 
for the attainment of his ends. On the other hand, in order 
to utilize to the utmost these advantages, those crops had to 
be cultivated which would permit of their application in the 
highest degree. Of all crops cotton conformed most perfectly 
to the conditions necessary to a profitable use of slave labor. 
Cotton culture was very simple, requiring few tools and only 
routine work. Furthermore, it gave employment for nine 
months in the year, so that the slave was idle very little of the 
time. And, most important of all, it permitted the organiza-
-P-A-G-E-115
SLAVERY AND THE SOUTH ‘101 
tion of labor on a large scale; a single slave could not cultivate 
more than three or four acres (as compared with thirty or 
forty acres in the case of corn), and they could therefore be 
more compactly massed than in the case of cereal crops. 
Owing to their ignorance and lack of versatility, it was pos- 
sible to employ the negroes only on staple crops which called 
for mechanical labor. The existence in the South of a crop, 
like cotton, which met these requirements in a high degree, 
firmly entrenched slavery and caused its rapid extension. 
82. Defects of slave labor.— That the Negro slave, at 
best only a generation or two removed from African barbarism, 
should have remained below the industrial standard of the 
white man, with his centuries of training, was natural.. When 
to inherited incapacity are added the defects of the system of 
slavery, one cannot feel surprised at the inferiority of slave 
labor. Since his labor was forced, the slave gave it reluctantly ; 
he put as little strength and earnestness into his work as was 
compatible with safety from flogging. Olmsted concluded 
that slaves were hardly one half as efficient as free laborers. 
This disinclination to work, and the frequent shamming it 
led to, necessitated the use of highly paid overseers, which 
tended to offset the cheapness of the slave labor. Another 
characteristic was its ignorance, clumsiness, and wastefulness. 
Only the heaviest and simplest tools could be used; improved 
implements and machinery and fine live stock could not 
be entrusted to the slaves. The inefficiency of slave 
labor as compared with the responsible and intelligent free 
labor of the North was thus greatly augmented. As it was 
impossible to introduce improvements in methods of agricul- 
ture or labor-saving devices into the South, this section of the 
country tended continually to fall farther behind the rest of 
the nation in the relative production of wealth. Finally, 
the lack of interest, of elasticity, and of versatility of slave 
labor confined the southern States to a few staple agricultural 
crops, and entirely prevented any diversification of industry 
or the rise of manufactures.
-P-A-G-E-116
  102 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
But the disadvantages of slavery were not confined to the 
character of the labor only. A defect of another kind was the 
difficulty a young man of small means experienced in getting 
a start in a slave district. Land was cheap, but to purchase 
the necessary labor force necessitated a large investment of 
capital— much more than was required for the land and 
live stock. It was difficult for any one to become a planter 
unless he had inherited slaves or had wealth. A farmer in 
the Northwest could expand his operations with very much 
less capital. Even in the case of wealthy planters the neces- 
sity of locking up a large amount of capital in slaves probably 
held the labor force down to a point below its most econom- 
ical expansion. 
83. Effect on the production of cotton.— The result of 
such a system was first that the production of cotton, great as 
3t, was, did not begin to equal the capabilities of the South. 
Only a small part of the land was cultivated; in 1850 De Bow 
calculated that the entire cotton crop of that year was grown 
on only 5,000,000 acres.’ And, secondly, since its cultivation 
depended now largely on slave labor, its production increased 
only with the growth of slavery. As this form of labor was 
increased at the best more slowly than similar supplies of free 
labor would have been, the system of slavery stifled the prog- 
ress of the South even in that branch of production in which 
it was supposed to excel and to which it had sacrificed all 
others. There was no equilibrium between supply and de- 
mand; since his capital was all invested in slaves and cotton 
lands, the planter found it practically impossible to decrease 
his production in times of over-supply and equally difficult 
to increase it rapidly when the price rose. Cotton growing 
was thus extremely uncertain and speculative. The produc- 
tion of cotton probably lagged behind the economic demand 
during the decade and a half before the war, as is shown by 
the rising price of that commodity and by the great increase 
in the price of slaves. In 1840 the average value of all slaves 
dependent on cotton culture was estimated by De Bow at
-P-A-G-E-117
SLAVERY AND THE SOUTH 103 
$500; twenty years later Olmsted found that good field hands 
were worth $1400 on the average, while as high as $2000 was 
sometimes paid. 
84. The economic cost of slave labor.— That slavery in- 
volved an economic loss to the nation and also to the South 
as a whole is evident. Was it profitable to the slave-owner? 
The items involved in the yearly cost of a slave to his master 
were many, including interest on capital invested in him, cost 
of maintenance (food, clothing, and lodging), depreciation, 
taxation, and insurance against death, sickness, and flight. 
Did these items amount to more or less than the wages of a 
free laborer? On this point may be quoted the testimony of 
a slaveholder from Kentucky about 1840, as reported by the 
English traveler, J. S. Buckingham: 
“ He said he had not only made the calculation, but actually 
tried the experiment of comparing the labour of the free white 
white man and the negro slave; and he found the latter 
always the dearer of the two. It took, for instance, 2000 
dollars to purchase a good male slave. The interest on money 
in Kentucky being ten per cent, here was 200 dollars a year 
of actual, cost; but to insure his life it would require at 
least five per cent more, which would make 300 dollars a 
year. Add to this the necessary expenses of maintenance 
while healthy, and medical attendance while sick, with wages 
of white overseers to every gang of men to see that 
they do their duty, and other incidental charges, and he did 
not think that a slave could cost less, in interest, insurance, 
subsistence, and watching, than 500 dollars or £100 Sterling 
a year; yet, after all, he would not do more than half the 
work of a white man, who could be. hired at the same sum, 
without the outlay of any capital, or. the incumbrance of 
maintenance while sick, and was, therefore, by far the cheaper 
labourer of the two.” 
The diet of the slaves was coarse but wholesome; cornmeal, 
with molasses, and generally bacon, were the staples. The 
clothing was of the coarsest, and the cabins, while rude, were
-P-A-G-E-118
  104 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
probably as good as the inmates could appreciate. Any com- 
parison between slave labor and white free labor must’ be 
misleading, for many of the defects in the system were due to 
the fact that the slave was a Negro as well asa bondman. The 
real problem involved was that of the relative efficiency of 
slave and free Negro labor, an answer to which is the solution 
of the labor problem of the South to-day. 
85. Character of plantation management.— The defects 
of the system were, however, not wholly due to the quality 
of the labor; the incapacity of the masters was also responsi- 
ble for the failure of agriculture in the South. The absence 
of rotation or diversification of crops and of the use of ferti- 
lizers to prevent the exhaustion of the soil, of improved live 
stock, of machinery, building, and fences; in short the lack 
of a scientific agriculture, even among the small planters with- 
out slaves, was a frequent matter of complaint in southern 
journals and conventions. Large plantations were the rule: 
the average size of the farms in the ten cotton States in 1850 
was 273 acres, and this had considerably increased by 1860. 
Some of the cotton plantations contained over 10,000 acres. 
These were confined, however, to the rich alluvial lands of 
the Mississippi bottoms. On the poorer and less fertile soils 
of the Piedmont and upland regions, which were illy adapted 
to plantation methods, small farms were the rule. On the 
large plantations the management was generally left to an 
overseer, who sought only to obtain the largest possible crop 
without regard to the future. Absenteeism of the owner was 
not frequent, as the planter’s life was regarded as an ideal 
one. But the planters felt a contempt for labor, were often 
unenterprising and lazy, and did not develop their estates. 
Morcover, the profits secured from cotton production, instead 
of going to improve the land, were spent unprofitably or 
sunk in the purchase of fresh fields and additional slaves. The 
capital of the South was thus invested in fixed forms which 
tied it down to prevailing methods and permitted no improve- 
ment or diversification from year to year.
-P-A-G-E-119
  SLAVERY AND THE SOUTH 105 
86. Moral effects of slavery.— The effects of slavery 
obviously did not end with the economic losses involved; 
more insidious and harmful were the moral results. Not only 
were the marriage relations among the slaves loose in the 
extreme, but they were rendered still more so by the breaking 
up of families through sale. Such a state of affairs, together 
with the possession of unlimited 
power on the part of masters 
and lax morals on the part of 
female slaves, reacted upon the 
relations between the whites 
and blacks. Of the treatment 
of slaves it is difficult to speak 
with accuracy. On the large 
cotton and sugar plantations, 
especially in the malarious rice- 
fields of Georgia and South 
Carolina, the Negroes suffered 
most. Here they were under the 
direction of overseers and were 
driven and herded in gangs. This cut was a familiar illustra-

consideration. The possession of at wei pa

have led to the abuse of that 
power and to inhuman conduct. Flogging necessarily accom- 
panied the system of slave labor, but wanton cruelty in the 
use of the lash certainly did not rule. The treatment was 
probably severest in the lower South, but the supervision 
was strictest in the border States, where there was greater 
danger of running away. Slaves were regarded as only a 
form of property; they were sold and transferred like other 
commodities. Regular slave-markets were held where slave- 
  Runaway Stave 
  
 
-P-A-G-E-120
  106 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
dealers auctioned off their human chattels. To the credit 
of the South it must be said that the slave-dealer was usually 
a social outcast. Every effort was made to keep the slave 
from rising, and. while religious instruction was generally 
given, education was strictly forbidden by law. 
87. Slavery and the population.— The ownership of the 
slaves was concentrated in a very few hands. Less than 5 
per cent. of a population of 8,000,000 whites in the southern 
States owned the 3,950,000 slaves in the United States in 
- 1860, Associated with these actual slave-owners were many 
persons, as merchants, lawyers, and even clergymen, who, 
while not slave-owners themselves, sympathized thoroughly 
with them in their attitude towards slavery. There was thus 
a strong segregation of the races as a result of this institution, 
but the stratification of neither race had proceeded very’ 
far. The Negroes may be differentiated into field hands, and 
house servants, artisans, mechanics, etc.; and the whites into 
the slave-owners and the professional and commercial classes 
at one extreme and the “poor whites” at the other. How- 
ever, the white farmers tended to concentrate in the so-called 
white counties, where the soil was less fertile and the trans- 
portation facilities poorer, while the slaves with a sprinkling 
of whites were localized in the more fertile districts. There 
was also a small and growing number of free Negroes, though 
most of these were to be found in the North. 
88. Progress of the South prevented. — Slavery prevented 
the growth of population in the South. Although they had 
started out almost even in 1800, the North had increased much 
more rapidly, having in 1860 a population of 19,083,927, as 
against 12,315,374 in the South. Much of this increase natu- 
rally came from foreign immigration, which avoided the slave 
States and peopled the central States and the great North- 
west. Greater than this loss, however, was the lack of diver- 
sified industries in the South. Not merely was the agriculture 
confined to a few staple crops; but, most important of all, 
manufactures and mining were prevented from developing.
-P-A-G-E-121
  SLAVERY AND THE SOUTH: 107 
The Southern States were rich in natural resources, deposits 
of iron and coal, timber and water power, but these remained 
almost absolutely undeveloped prior to 1860. It was im- 
possible to carry on these industries with slave labor, and so 
long as. slavery existed, neither free labor nor capital could 
be attracted to their exploitation. Of the real and personal 
property in the country, $10,957,000,000 out of a total of 
$16,159,000,000 was credited to the northern States in 1859. 
Industrially and commercially the South remained stagnant, 
and not until war had abolished slavery was it prepared for 
the splendid industrial advance upon which it has now tardily 
entered. 
89. Summary: Sectional divergence. — The most striking 
characteristic of this period was the growing sectional diver- 
gence of North and South. The East was developing its 
manufactures and finding a rapidly expanding market for 
them in the growing population of the West, while this section 
was exchanging for these its surplus agricultural products. 
East and West were rapidly becoming economically integrated 
and forming together a state that was already almost self- 
sufficing. The South, on the other hand, while she purchased, 
large quantities of food stuffs and agricultural products from 
the West and furnished cotton and other staples to the East, 
was cut off by her “peculiar institution” from intimate 
social and political relations with the rest of the country. The 
sectional divergence reached a crisis when the expanding plan- 
tation slave system reached out after more land, which the 
people of the North determined should remain “ free soil.” 
90. Summary: Material Development.— The system of 
protection to manufacturing industries was early adopted as a 
conscious policy by the American people, especially after the 
embargo and the, War of 1812 had forced them to begin manu- 
facturing for themselves. As the South, condemned by the 
inefficiency of slave labor to a primitive agriculture, could not 
hope to develop manufactures for herself, she naturally ob- 
jected to paying higher prices to help northern manufacturers. 
‘
-P-A-G-E-122
  108 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
Thus the tariff first brought to a head the sectional differences, 
which were later to become so serious, between the slave and 
the free States. 
As yet, however, the country was too new and undeveloped 
to permit the growth of a purely industrial state; the west- 
ward movement was the indication of a national impulse to 
appropriate and exploit the wealth of a virgin soil. The 
purchase of Louisiana Territory gave a definite aim to this 
movement, although it did not initiate it. Hand in hand 
with the settlement of the western lands went the improve- 
ment of the means of transportation. So important was this 
that both Federal and State governments lent their aid to 
building turnpikes and canals, but, after some rather disas- 
trous experiences with these, left to private corporations the 
task of providing the country with railroads. Protection to 
American industries and the development of internal im- 
provements were the two parts of the “ American System,” 
which engaged the energies of the nation during this period. 
Capital and enterprise began to be diverted from foreign trade 
to internal development, and the first stage in the decline of the 
ocean merchant marine commenced. On the whole, it was a 
period of extraordinary material development, in which the 
exploitation of its natural resources became the definite aim 
of the people of the United States.

91. Effect of the Civil War.— The period from 1860 to 
1900 was characterized by the entrance of the United States 
into the world’s markets as the chief source of supply of food 
products and of raw materials for Europe. During that 
time the United States assumed the leading place as a pro- 
ducer and exporter of breadstuffs and grains, as she had 
already of cotton and tobacco. The Civil War affected the 
agricultural development of the country both directly and 
indirectly. As a result of the war demand for agricultural 
products, prices rose rapidly and production was greatly 
stimulated. At the same time the organization of great armies 
withdrew thousands of men from the farms and diminished 
the labor supply, a loss which was but partially made up by 
the immigration from Europe. One result of the scarcity of 
labor was the application to agriculture on an unprecedented 
scale of labor-saving machinery. It has even been asserted 
that the issue of the Civil War was decided by the invention 
of the reaper. The number of two-horse reapers in operation’ 
throughout the country, in the harvest of 1861, was estimated 
to have performed.an amount of work equal to about a 
million men. The ultimate victory of the North was no doubt 
largely due to the fact that during the war the gathering of

the harvests and the development of the Northwest proceeded 
suninterruptedly. /For instance, the wheat production-of Indi- 
ana increased from 15,000,000 bushels in 1859 to 20,000,000 in 
1863, although one tenth of her male population was in the 
army. In 1865 it was estimated that there were not less than 
250,000 reapers in use in the United States, each of which 
would cut an average of ten acres in a day of twelve hours. 
On the other hand, the greatest blow struck the South was 
the establishment of a naval blockade which prevented the 
marketing of her great staple, cotton. 
92. Growth of the grain States.— The population of the 
grain States (z.e., the North Central division) increased during 
the decade 1860-70 by more than 42 per cent., and in the next 
decade by nearly 34 per cent.; this represented an addition 
to the population in twenty years of over 8,000,000 inhabit- 
ants. The opening of new land to settlement stimulated im- 
migration to such an extent that 2,500,000 persons came to the 
United States during the decade 1860-70, to be followed in 
the next ten years by 3,000,000 more, a large proportion of 
whom settled in the middle West. The greatest growth took 
place in the newer States of the Northwest, although even in 
the older States, like Illinois, Iowa, and Missouri, the increase 
was more rapid than the general rate. In the single decade 
1870-1880 over 190,080,000 acres, or a territory equal in 
extent to Great Britain and France combined, were added to 
the cultivated area of the United States. Again, in the 
twenty-year period, 1880-1900, there were added to the farm 
area over 305,000,000 acres. Such a development was made 
possible by the extension of the railroad system in the grain 
region, which opened up new areas for cultivation and made 
it possible to market the product speedily and economically. 
A powerful influence leading to the settlement of the spring 
wheat section of the-Northwest was exerted-by-the-introduc- 
tion in the early seventies of the “new process ” of reducing 
wheat to flour. Iron and porcelain rollers replaced the old 
millstones, the grain being run through half a dozen sets of
-P-A-G-E-127
  APPLICATION OF MACHINERY TO AGRICULTURE 113 
yollers.. Whereas previously the flour made from spring 
wheat had been of inferior grade, it was now rendered superior 
to that made from winter wheat; consequently the price 
of spring wheat advanced and greatly stimulated the wheat- 
raising industry of that section. Between 1870 and: 1880 
the population of Minnesota and the Dakotas, where it was 
chiefly grown, increased from 453,887 to 915,950. 
93. The Homestead Act.— The passage of the Home; 
stead Act in 1862 made easy and profitable the acquisition of 
a farm home, especially for those with little capital. The 
fundamental principle of the act was the grant of a free 
homestead not exceeding 160 acres to the actual settler; after 
five years’ residence the title passed, without charge, to the 
“homesteader.” As a result of this law thousands of people 
took up the free land of the middle West, over 65,000,000 
acres being given away to individuals during the twenty-year 
period 1860-1880. This fact was the logical outcome of the 
pre-emption system and has since been the accepted policy 
of the government in disposing of the. public lands. The 
settlement of the public domain was further stimulated by 
modifications of the Homestead Act, making it easy for ex- 
soldiers of the Union armies to acquire title to government 
land, and by the rising tide of immigration. So rapid 
was the settlement of free land that by 1880 the “ frontier ” 
had entirely disappeared and there was practically continuous 
settlement from ocean to ocean. Of the Homestead Act 
the Public Land Commission said: “It protects the govern- 
1“ Spring wheat is especially rich in gluten, which is advantageous in 
bread-making. But so long as the stones were set close together and the 
grain reduced to flour at one grinding, the bran, which is coarser in 
spring wheat, remained with the flour, discolored it, and by absorbing 
moisture caused it to spoil. The new process consisted in setting the 
stones farther apart at first and removing the bran in large pieces 
before reducing the rest to flour. The germ, being oily, is also 
removed. The roller or “patent” process differs chiefly in that buhr- 
stones are replaced by rollers, but the principle of successive millings 
is retained.” E. V. Robinson, Commercial Geography, p. 159, note.

ment, it fills the States with homes, it builds up communities 
and lessens the chances of social and civil disorder by giving 
ownership of the soil, in small tracts, to the occupants thereof. 
It was copied from no other nation’s system. It was originally 
and distinctly American, and remains a monument to its 
originators.” 
94. Number and ownership of farms. — The increase in the 
number of farms, from 2,044,077 in 1860 to 4,008,907 in 1880, 
.and to 5,700,000 in 1900, resulted partly from the inclusion 
in the farm area of hitherto uncultivated lands and partly 
from the subdivision of existing farms; the former was true 
principally of the West, the latter of the South. This was 
a rate of growth more rapid than that of the population. 
Accordingly, the agricultural population was much better pro- 
vided with separate farms at the end of this period than at 
the beginning; between 1850’and 1900 the proportion of farms 
to the rural population increased from 1 farm for every 14 
persons to 1 farm for every 9 persons. This gain represented 
both ‘the subdivision of old farms and the taking up of new 
land. The average size of farms declined between 1850 and 
1880, owing to the resort to more intensive farming in the 
eastern States and to the division of the large southern planta- 
tions after the Civil War. After 1880 there was a slight 
increase again in the size of farms (from an average of 133.7 
acres in that year to 146.6 acres in 1900) as a result mainly of 
the inclusion in the census reports of the grazing ranches of the 
Southwest. 
The addition of such a vast area to the improved farm 
lands — over 425,000,000 acres between 1860 and 1900 — and 
the accompanying expansion of production, was not without 
its disadvantages. Although the United States thereby ob- 
tained a leading position as a producer and exporter of food- 
stuffs, there was involved the partial disorganization of 
agriculture in the eastern States and discontent in the West 
itself. So eager were the settlers to acquire land on such 
favorable terms that the taking up of farms proceeded more
-P-A-G-E-129
  APPLICATION OF MACHINERY TO AGRICULTURE 115 
rapidly than was justified by the economic demand for the 
products they raised. There was thus a great over-production, 
especially of wheat, and prices were greatly depressed. In 
many cases, perhaps the majority, crops were grown at a 
loss, the rise in the value of the land being counted as the real 
reward. The result was naturally an over-supply of farm 
products, with consequent low prices, which seriously affected 
land values and production in the older sections of the 
country and led to a vast amount of discontent among 
western farmers. This found expression in a series of farmers’ 
movements beginning with the Granger movement of the early 
seventies and ending with the Populist movement in the early 
nineties. 
The increase in the production of the six principal cereals 
during this period is shown in the following table:

95. Ownership of farms. — More important, however, than 
the expansion of the farm area was the question of farm'tenure. 
In 1880, for the first time, statistics of farm ownership were 
published in the census, when the gratifying result was re- 
vealed that three quarters (74.5 per cent.) of the farms in the 
United States were operated by their owners. After that the 
proportion fell considerably, to 71.6 per cent. in 1890 and 
64.7 per cent. in 1900, and alarm was expressed that our demo- 
cratic conditions of land ownership were giving way to a 
system of tenantry. The reverse, however, seems to have 
been true, and the growth of the tenant class indicated rather 
the endeavor. of farm laborers and persons of small means  
-P-A-G-E-130
  1 
116 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
to make themselves independent than the fall of owners 
to the rank of tenants. This is shown by the steady growth 
of farm owners, more rapid even than the increase in the 
agricultural population. The gieatest increase in tenant 
farming was in the South, where the large plantations were 
being broken up and cultivated by small cash or share tenants. 
The division of the plantations of the South and of the 
“bonanza” farms of the West showed the extension of the 
small farm system rather than the decline of ownership; a 
large proportion of the tenant farms in 1900 were under 20 
acres. A study of the ages of operating owners, tenants, and 
laborers strengthens this conclusion. Almost 90 per cent. of 
the farm laborers were under 35 years of age, 67 per cent. of 
the tenants were under 45, while nearly 60 per cent. of the 
owners were over 45 years of age. There was thus, with ad- 
vancing age, a steady rise from the condition of laborer to 
tenant and finally to that of owner. Nor did the existence 
of mortgage indebtedness warrant any gloomy foreboding; 
taken in connection with the other facts it must be held to 
represent the struggle of the former tenant to purchase an 
equity in the land he tilled, or of the small owner to provide 
himself with the necessary capital for improvements. 
"96. Regional specialization. — With the change from self- 
sufficing to commercial agriculture there went on increasing 
concentration on certain great staples best adapted to the 
different regions. The production of a few staples on a large 
scale was made possible by improved farm machinery and 
transportation facilities and ready access to markets; this 
specialization in turn stimulated the invention and application 
of machinery and the development of large-scale methods. 
In New England, which felt most severely the competition of 
the fresh wheat and corn lands of the West, resort was had to 
a more intensive cultivation, or else the land went out of culti- 
vation; dairying and mixed farming were found most profit- 
able. The production of hay and grain employed almost
-P-A-G-E-131
APPLICATION OF MACHINERY TO AGRICULTURE 117 
every farm throughout the North Central and Northwestern 
regions; corn far outstripped all other grains in importance. In 
the South cotton was practically the only crop below the 
thirty-fifth parallel of latitude, while north of this tobacco, 
grains, and live-stock supplemented but did not supplant 
cotton. The raising of live-stock was the chief industry in 
the semi-arid region of the Far West, and was also important 
generally throughout the northern States. The North Central 
division constituted the greatest farming section of the 
country, producing in 1900 half of the agricultural wealth of 
the country. Within this district Iowa led as our most im- 
portant farming State, with products valued at $365,000,000. 
97. Agricultural machinery. — The application of machin- 
ery to agriculture, which had begun before the war, was now 
made on a still more extensive scale, the value of farming 
implements and machinery increasing from $246,000,000 in 
1860 to $406,000,000 in 1880, and to $761,000,000 in 1900. It 
was estimated in 1880 that over 10,000 patents had been 
granted in this country up to that time for implements and 
machines connected directly with the cultivation, harvesting, 
and handling of grain. Of these the most important were 
the threshers (first driven by horse power and then by steam), 
the reapers, and finally the complete harvester. By means of 
these improved agricultural machines the average amount of 
grain that could be harvested, threshed, and prepared for the 
market, from the standing grain to the marketable product, 
by a single man per day, was increased from about 4 bushels 
in 1830 to about 50 bushels in 1880. A few years later Mr. 
D. A. Wells estimated that the labor of three to four men on 
the great wheat-fields of Dakota would annually produce, con- 
vert into flour, and transport to the seaboard one thousand 
barrels of flour, or enough for the yearly consumption of one 
thousand persons. Perhaps the twine binder, more than any 
other single invention, was responsible for this expansion, for 
the limit upon production was set by the possibility of harvest-
-P-A-G-E-132
118 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
ing rather than of planting or of growing. The effect on the 
production of wheat is seen in the growth of the per capita 
production for the United States from 5.6 bushels in 1860 to 
8.7 bushels in 1900. At the same time the cost of wheat bread 
to the consumer was greatly cheapened.

The greatest development took place on the enormous farms 
of the Far West; here were used enormous fifty horse-power 
steam traction engines to operate plows, harrows, drills, har- 
vesting machines, etc. But in the middle West the progress 
was no less rapid, and the work of planting, cultivating, and
-P-A-G-E-133
  APPLICATION OF MACHINERY TO AGRICULTURE 119 
husking corn was carried on by machinery; particularly im- 
portant in this connection was the “check rower” which 
allowed the planting of the crop in rows running in two 
directions, thus permitting cross-cultivation. Mowing ma- 
chines, horse hay-rakes, tedders, and stackers revolutionized 
the work of making hay; while potato planters and diggers, 
feed choppers, and grinders, manure spreaders, ditch-digging 
machines, and innumerable other implements greatly lessened 
he hand labor required. 
The introduction of machine power had many far-reaching | 
results. It greatly increased the efficiency and mental activity 
of the workers, and at the same time lessened the physical 
strain upon them. It has been estimated that in the case of 
nine of the more important farm crops, in the production of 
~which machinery was much used, the average increase of 
efficiency between 1830 and 1895 was nearly 500 per cent. 
Machinery increased the output of farm products; this caused, 
a fall in the price of farm products, and the lessened cost of 
food benefited all classes; the farmer did not suffer materially 
from the smaller price per unit, as this was more than offset by 
the larger output. The increased output and lower prices also 
brought about a redistribution of the working force of the 
country. Not being needed on the farm, the farmers’ children 
moved to the city and devoted themselves to other occupations. 
It has been said that the American farmer during this period 
was a miner rather than an agriculturist; that he extracted 
the wealth from the soil without again restoring the lost 
qualities. With the increased use of farm machinery and the 
large capital investment required, the modern farmer might 
fairly be regarded as a manufacturer; agriculture was becom- 
ing more of a business and less an art exposed to the caprices 
of nature. 
The motive power for most of this machinery was that 
of the horse or mule; accordingly the increase in the number 
of these animals proceeded pari passu with that of farm 
machinery, There were in the United States in 1900 over st 
 
-P-A-G-E-134
    120 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
24,000,000 horses and mules on the farms alone; whereas, in- 
cluding those in the towns, there were in Germany only 4,184- 
000, in France 2,903,000, and in Great Britain 2,000,000. 
“The agricultural supremacy of the United States,” wrote 
Professor Leroy-Beaulieu, “ has been won through the com- 
bined use of machinery and domestic animals to turn into 
wealth the fertility of a virgin soil.”

Elevators are used for storing grain until it is wanted for use.’ The 
larger modern elevators consist of huge steel tanks or bins, capable 
of holding 500,000 to 1,000,000 bushels. They are usually built by the 
water and with rail connections, as shown above, so that the grain 
may be shipped either by water or rail. The vessel at the extreme 
left in the foreground is a whaleback, a fast-disappearing type on the 
Great Lakes. 
Hardly less important than the invention of agricultural 
machinery were the improvements in the methods of trans- 
porting and handling the grain. As long as it remained in the 
farmer’s hands the grain was carried entirely by hand in bags 
or sacks and was moved by teams. After it left the farm it 
was handled and carried in bulk by steam power. A system
-P-A-G-E-135
  
   APPLICATION OF MACHINERY TO AGRICULTURE 121 
of grading and classification was established by which all 
specific lots of a certain grade were dealt with together in 
bulk, in the most economical manner. The use of elevators 
for transferring or storing grain made it possible to unload and 
elevate the grain, in the best establishments, at the rate of a 
carload a minute; vessels were loaded in turn from the ele- 
vators at the rate of 8000 to 10,000 bushels an hour. The use 
of such unique methods alone: made it possible to handle the 
growing grain trade of the country. 
98. Growth of the international grain trade. — One result 
of the great movement of grain by steam was the better dis- 
tribution of the world’s grain supply. Before that a short 
crop in any country meant dear bread in that place, if not 
famine, but now the shortage of one country was quickly 
made up by the surplus of another. The exportation of 
breadstuffs by the United States did not begin on a large scale 
until after 1860, but during the Civil War the exports in- 
creased enormously, partly owing to the fact that the cutting 
off of the market in the southern States threw a large surplus 
into the channels of foreign trade. The following decade 
disclosed an even more astonishing growth. As the increase 
in cereal production was twice as rapid as the growth of popu- 
lation, a large exportable surplus was grown each year. The 
exports of wheat and corn — the only two cereals sent abroad 
to any extent — are shown in the following table:

  122 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
One interesting change took place in the exports of wheat 
—whereas in 1830 flour constituted 99 per cent. of the total 
wheat exported, by. 1880 it had fallen to less than 25 per cent. 
This change was due largely to the protection given by various 
European countries to the milling interest. As a result most 
of the American flour still exported went to the West Indies 
and to the South American countries. The United States 
was already the most important wheat-exporting country in 
the world, supplying about half the needs of wheat-importing 
nations. Russia, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey were the 
other most important wheat-growing countries, while Great 
Britain, Switzerland, Italy, and Belgium were our best cus- 
tomers. Of Indian corn only 5 per cent. of the total crop was 
exported, the rest being used chiefly as a feed crop at home. 
99. Failure of the plantation system in the South. — Under 
the system of slavery a large part of the capital of Southern 
planters which would otherwise have taken the form of im- 
proved lands, buildings, and machinery had been invested in 
slaves. The 3,953,760 slaves in the South in 1860 were valued 
at $2,000,000,000; in the planting States this form of property 
greatly execeded all others, both real and personal. The 
Civil War not only swept away this form of property, but 
resulted in the destruction of buildings, tools, cattle and 
other capital. The high price of cotton, however — 43 cents 
a pound in 1865 and 30 cents in 1866—encouraged the 
planters to revive its production. Many borrowed the nec- 
essary capital, thus introducing on a large scale the system 
of agricultural credit which has since been so characteristic 
of southern agriculture, and proceeded to raise cotton with 
hired labor. This had two unfortunate results: in the first 
place, there was an over-production of cotton, causing a 
rapid fall in the price; in the second place, it led to a revival 
of the old one-crop plantation system, with its concentration 
on cotton. The wage system which was thus inaugurated 
was found to be utterly unsatisfactory, as the freedmen were 
quite irresponsible. The character of the labor and the falling
-P-A-G-E-137
APPLICATION OF MACHINERY TO AGRICULTURE 123 
price of cotton, in addition to the burden of. over-taxation 
under the carpet-bag governments, caused the ruin of many 
planters, and vast areas of land went out of cultivation. 
“Plantations that had brought from $100,000 to $150,000 
before the war and even since, were sold at $6000 or $10,000 
or hung on the hands of the planter and his factor at any 
price. The ruin seemed to be universal and complete, and the 
old plantation system, it then seemed, had perished utterly 
and forever.”+ The total value of farming lands in the South 
declined over 48 per cent. between 1860 and 1870. 
100. The era of small farms. — An era of small farms fol- 
lowed the failure of the large plantation system under free 
labor, and the large land holdings were broken up to suit 
small purchasers. Many of the white yeomen and not a few 
negroes purchased farms of ten.to twelve acres, and pro- 
ceeded to raise cotton on their own account. In Mississippi, 
for example, there were but 412 farms of less than 10 acres 
in 1867, and 10,003 in 1870; the number of small farms of less 
than 100 acres increased 55 per cent. in the South during 
the decade 1860-70, while the average size of farms decreased 
from 401.7 acres to 229.8 acres. Nearly 40 per cent.of the 
laborers engaged in the cultivation of cotton by .1876 were 
whites, as against about 11 per cent. before the war. In fact, 
it was mainly the poorer whites who took over the land re- 
linquished by the large ante-bellum planters and began the 
“ process of regenerating the South. Most of the land was not 
bought outright by the small farmer, however, but was worked 
on shares; the system of cash rents was never widespread. 
Under these systems the methods of production were gradually 
improved, fertilizers and improved machinery were more 
generally used, and the average yield-of cotton per acre in- 
creased from 172 pounds in 1860 to 222 in 1870. The total 
yield of 2,275,372,000 pounds in 1860, the last uninterrupted 
year of production under slavery, was, however, not equalled 
until 1879, when the product was 2,404,410,000 pounds.

101. The system of agricultural credit. — Although the 
method of advancing money and supplies on growing crops 
was practised in the South before the war, the necessities of 
planters after that event made its use characteristic of

Gin houses are built nowadays at railroad centers, where the ginning for the neighborhood is done. A modern establishment contains, in addi-

southern agriculture. Cotton factors advanced the capital 
necessary to revive the production of this staple, themselves 
often borrowing from commission houses, and taking a crop 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
  APPLICATION OF MACHINERY TO AGRICULTURE 125 
lien on the growing crop of the planter. When falling prices 
resulted in the breaking up of the plantation system and the 
rise of a small tenant and freehold farming class, the system 
was extended. The lender was now, however, the merchant 
and country storekeeper, who was personally familiar with 
the small borrower and who could, moreover, exercise constant 
supervision over the crop. While economically necessary at 
first as a means of securing the needed capital, this practice 
of agricultural credit soon resulted in a system of peonage of 
the debtor farmer to the merchant who became his creditor, 
under which the debtor was kept almost in a state of serfdom, 
working for his creditor until his debts were paid. All sup- 
plies must be purchased through the creditor, and the crops 
must be sold through him, on both of which transactions 
lucrative commissions were charged in addition to frequently 
usurious rates of interest. 
This system had certain undesirable effects. Since cotton 
was the most marketable crop and would always sell for cash, 
the lender insisted that the farmer concentrate his efforts 
upon cotton growing. In the second place, since the farmer 
was compelled to buy all his supplies from the lender’s store, 
he was discouraged from growing his own corn or bacon 
since this would diminish his purchases. As Hammond put 
it, “ The raising of corn would not only give a less market- 
able crop into the hands of the merchant, but it would 
eventually lose him his customers, for the raising of his 
own supplies would release the farmer from the necessity of 
doing business on a credit basis.” Diversification of farm- 
ing and even rotation of crops were thus prevented in the 
South. 
102. Live-stock. — Cattle raising is a frontier industry, and 
accordingly it has not only been carried on most extensively - 
in the western part of the country, but it has also been a more 
important industry in the United States as a whole than in 
Europe. The so-called “native” cattle, probably the de- 
scendants of Spanish cattle brought over by Cortez, had multi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-140

plied rapidly in Texas, and after the Civil War an outlet for 
them. was sought in the North. It was discovered 
that if Texas cattle were driven to the northern ranges they 
gained more rapidly in weight than if they remained in Texas; 
and moreover the beef thus matured was of better quality. 
By 1870 a clearly defined cattle-trail had been marked out 
* over which an average of about 300,000 cattle were driven 
northward annually from the breeding grounds in Texas. 
The points where the cattle-trail crossed the transcontinental 
railroads became important cattle markets and shipping- 
points. After 1885 the importance of the ¢cattle-trail began 
to decline, partly because the taking up of western land in 
farms reduced the amount of the free range, but chiefly 
because the railroads were built into the heart of the cattle 
country and transported the cattle direct to market. They 
were fattened now in the corn-growing regions of eastern 
Kansas and Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois. 
The process of converting this live stock into food for human 
consumption began its wonderful growth during this period. 
The invention of the refrigerator car, the first shipment by 
which from Chicago to New York took place in 1869, gave a 
wonderful impetus to the slaughtering and meat-packing 
industry. Pork-packing, which had been done mainly in the 
winter up to this time, was now possible during the summer; 
the number of hogs killed grew from 992,310 in 1860 to. 
11,001,699 in 1880, and to 28,742,551 in 1900. The dressed 
beef trade, too, was given a stimulus by the introduction of 
the refrigerating process. The export of fresh beef dates from 
1876, though the exportation of live cattle had already begun 
in 1870. The total value of the products in the slaughtering 
and meat-packing industries grew enormously, from about 
$29,000,000 in 1860 to $303,500,000 in 1880, and $790,000,000 
in 1900. 
103. Dairy products. — The dairy industry was also revo- 
_ lutionized by the introduction of factory methods in the 
making of butter and cheese, although a beginning had been
-P-A-G-E-141
APPLICATION OF MACHINERY TO AGRICULTURE 
made before the Civil War. 127 
Cheese-making developed 
rapidly under the factory system during the sixties and 
seventies, and by 1880 more than four-fifths of the cheese 
produced in the United States was made in factories. There 
were natural limits to the 
expansion of the industry, 
however, in part, the rela- 
tively small domestic con- 
sumption of cheese, and 
in part the lack of a 
foreign» demand for the 
American product. After 
1880 butter-making dis- 
placed cheese as the lead- 
ing dairy industry. At 
that time, however, most 
of the butter was. still 
made on the farms, and 
the common form of churn 
in use for butter making 
was aptly described by a 
child’s riddle: “ Big at the 
bottom and small at the 
top, a thing in the middle 
goes flippety-flop.” A great 
stimulus to the develop- 
ment of factory methods 
in butter making was 
given by the invention of 
the Babcock test for de- 
termining the butter-fat of 
milk, and of the centrifu- 
gal cream separator for 
extracting the cream with- 
out having to “set” the 
milk and wait for the cream 
  Cream SEPARATOR 
The invention of the Babcock test, for 
determining the butter-fat of milk, and 
of the centrifugal machine for separat- 
ing cream from milk, by reducing the 
cost, gave a great impetus to butter 
making. In such a machine the cream 
is separated from the milk by centrifu- 
gal forcee—the heavier milk being 
thrown outward from a rapidly revolv- 
ing cylinder while the cream remains 
at the center. In a butter or cheese 
factory the separators and churns are 
driven by steam; the old processes of 
“setting” and “skimming” and of 
churning by hand have given place to 
factory methods.
-P-A-G-E-142
  128 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
to rise. The center of the butter-making industry came to 
be located in the corn-belt, Elgin, Illinois, being one of the 
greatest butter markets in the world. The Americans prob- 
ably consumed more butter than any other people. 
  
  Power CuurN and Burren Mixer 
Butter is made by separating the butter-fat in cream form from the 
milk serum by the process of churning, which consists in agitating the 
cream. In the old-fashioned dash churn the motion was largely one 
of stirring, but the modern churn as shown in the pictures secures 
the result by means of the concussion of the particles upon the sides 
of the revolving or moving vessel. At the right of the churn is the 
butter mixer, a revolving table with fluted power roller under which 
the butter is brought by the revolutions of the table. The mixer 
works out the butter-milk, a process which was formerly done by 
hand. The latest churns are fitted inside with rollers, by means of 
which, after the churning and washing, the butter is worked and 
salted without being removed from the churn. 
SUGGESTIVE TOPICS AND QUESTIONS. CHAPTER VII 
During the Civil War the first problem was that of raising sufficient 
food; this was answered very differently in the North and the South. 
After the war the problem was one of readjustment, but this also was 
very unlike in the two sections. The difficulties were enhanced by the

  CHAPTER VII 
AGRICULTURE AS A BUSINESS 
104. Position and growth of agriculture.— Down to 1880 
agriculture was the principal source of wealth in the United 
States, but each succeeding census report has shown larger 
values of manufactured articles than of agricultural products. 
The proportion of the population engaged in agriculture has 
also steadily declined, until to-day it is less than one-third 
of the total. It must not, however, be inferred from these 
facts that agriculture is a declining industry. The farm area 
under cultivation has steadily increased while improved 
methods of cultivation and of transportation have so greatly 
augmented the yield that a large surplus of agricultural prod- 
ucts over the needs of the people is annually set free for 
export. Agriculture still gives employment to a larger propor- 
tion of the population than any other branch of industry, and 
is progressing only less rapidly than the manufacturing and 
transportation industries. 
The relative slowing up of agricultural expansion as com- 
pared with manufactures is due to the taking up of practically 
all the cultivable land in the United States. Further develop- 
ment in agriculture will take place in the improvement of 
existing farms rather than in the exploitation of additional 
new land. In this respect agriculture differs from manufac- 
turing, where new processes and inventions are opening up 
ever-broadening fields of enterprise. This fact is illustrated 
by the slow growth in the number of farms during the last 
twenty years; in 1900 there were 5,737,372, by 1910 some 
6,361,502, and in 1920 only 6,449,998; there was an actual 
decline in the number of farms in exactly half of the states 
132

  AGRICULTURE AS A BUSINESS ; 133 
during the period 1910-1920. While the size of the average 
farm declined somewhat in the first’ decade of the twentieth 
century, it has increased again during the past ten years 
to 148.2 acres, due to the greater economy in operation of 
the larger farm with the aid of labor-saving machinery. 
105. Farm tenancy.— The proportion of farms operated 
by tenants, which amounted to 35.3 per cent, in 1900, con- 
tinued to increase until in 1910 they constituted 37.9 per cent. 
and 38.1 per cent. in 1920. During the World War there 
was a slackening in the rate of increase in tenant farm- 
ing, due on the one hand to high prices obtained for 
farm products and the consequent profits accruing from 
operation by the owner, and on the other hand to the 
withdrawal of labor into industry and into the army. It 
is impossible to say whether the tendency to increasing 
tenancy has been definitely reversed or only tem- 
porarily checked. Tenancy is found in greatest degree in the 
rich agricultural districts where the price of land is highest, 
and where consequently it is difficult for a young man to pur- 
chase land of his own. It is also found to have resulted in 
those sections where specialization in cereal production has 
proceeded furthest, that is where a standardized routine 
agriculture is practised; on the other hand, where diversified 
farming is carried on, ownership is more general. Owners 
tend to be more progressive while tenants follow the beaten 
track. Whether tenancy is to persist as a permanent phenom- 
enon will probably depend upon the character of agriculture 
which the future may develop in the United States. 
106. Farm machinery. — The distinctive feature of Ameri- 
can agriculture during the last half century has been the grow- 
ing use of farm machinery. The American farmer is known 
by his labor-saving machines and implements. Their wide 
use has been promoted by the peculiar conditions existing in 
this country, of cheap land and dear labor, which made. it 
necessary to economize in the latter factor. The introduction 
of farm machinery has in turn changed the systems of crop

management and especially of crop rotation. Larger areas 
of. cereal crops can now be grown because of the use of the 
‘self-binder as compared with the cradle and sickle; larger 
areas can also be handled in intertilled crops, and those that 
require much heavy labor in the harvesting. On the other

hand, the scarcity and high prices of farm labor have a ten- 
dency to reduce the area of crops that require much care. 
Probably the most important machine which has been in-

troduced in recent years, is the gasoline tractor. The impor- 
tance of this machine lies not so much in its performance up 
to date as in the vast possibilities which it opens up for the 
future. The steam engine was first applied to the work of 
plowing and threshing, but within the past twenty years has 
been pretty generally supplanted by the gasoline engine. As 
first developed in the northwest the gasoline tractor was a 
large heavy-duty machine, but this was hot very successful 
and was followed by the development of the caterpillar type 
of gasoline tractor, and finally by the light general-purpose 
tractor. The last named machine has already begun to dis- 
place horses to a noticeable extent. But the usefulness of 
the gasoline engine is not limited to. the work of plowing, 
cultivating, threshing and drawing loads. 
“Tt has been set to work turning the milk separator, the 
churn, the silage cutter, the washing machine, the sausage 
grinder and stuffer, the feed and fanning mills, and the grind- 
stone. It pumps water for the stock, for the house water 
tank, and for irrigation; it saws wood, shells corn, digs post 
holes, and drills the well. It mows the lawn, and runs the 
milking machine, the vacuum cleaner, and the lathe in the 
work-shop. By its power the barn and orchard are sprayed 
with disinfectant, and the sheep are sheared. Granaries and 
silos may be built to any desired height and filled by means 
of elevators run by gasoline. Is there any limit to which this 
engine may not go in relieving the farmer, his wife, and their 
helpers from wearying muscular effort and drudgery? ”*+ 
107. Cereal production. — The production of cereals is the 
most important branch of agriculture in the United States, 
representing more than half the total value of the crops raised 
and requiring the use of nearly half of all the improved farm 
land. There are eight cereal crops which are grown in con- 
siderable quantities, and which are, in the order of their im-. 
portance, corn, wheat, oats, barley, rye, buckwheat, rice, and

It will be noticed that while there have been fluctuations 
in the separate crops there has been no slackening in the 
increase of cereal production as a whole. Most of the gain 
has come from opening up new land in Minnesota, North and 
South Dakota, Nebraska, and Kansas, which contributed half 
of the increase in acreage during this period. Considerable 
additions have also been made by Texas and Oklahoma. 
With the practical exhaustion of unoccupied land suitable 
for grain raising it is evident that the future growth of cereal 
production will depend more upon improved methods of agri- 
culture than upon the addition of new lands; in any case 
the rate of increase will probably be slower than it has been 
in the past.  
-P-A-G-E-152
  138 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
Of the separate crops, corn is by far the most important, 
representing 75 per cent. of the total world production and 55 
per cent. of all the cereals in the United States in 1920; the 
crop for that year was worth $2,181,000,000. Most of the 
corn (75 per cent.) is fed to stock throughout the corn-belt 
and comes to market in the form of beef and pork, dairy

When dry the corn must be husked as soon as possible, that is, the

recently they have not proved satisfactory, and most of the husking 
is still done by hand. 
products, and poultry. In the production of wheat the United 
States also ranks first. Although. worth about one half as 
much as the corn crop ($1,135,800,000), it attracts more 
general attention because of its importance as an export 
crop, many European nations depending upon the United 
States to supply their deficits. But wheat, like beef, is to 
a certain extent a frontier crop, since it stands transportation

well and can be grown profitably by extensive methods. The - 
center of wheat production has moved steadily westward in 
the United States, and may soon pass beyond our national 
boundary to the new wheat lands in Canada. With-the ex- 
ception of oats, the value of which crop in 1920 was $720,- 
000,000, the other cereals are of minor importance, though 
rice is steadily gaining in significance, owing to new methods 
of cultivation. 
108. Cotton.— The production of cotton has steadily in- 
creased, from 4,717,000,000 pounds in 1900 to 5,325,000,000 
in 1910, and to 6,849,987,500 in 1921. As an export product 
its importance is still more marked, making up as it does 
about one quarter of the total exports. Notwithstanding 
vigorous efforts on the part of foreign producers to make 
themselves economically independent of the United States 
in the production of cotton, this country produces over sixty 
per cent. of the cotton supply of the world. A needed im- 
provement in the process of marketing cotton is now being 
made by the erection of more adequate warehouses for stor- 
ing cotton; it is estimated that southern farmers now lose 
$50,000,000 a year in the deterioration of their cotton through 
exposure to the weather. There have been invented various 
labor-saving implements in the production of cotton, of 
which the most important are the cottonseed planter, the 
fertilizer distributor, the cotton-stalk cutter, and various 
kinds of plows and harrows. Vigorous efforts are also being 
made to perfect cotton-picking machinery. A definite limit is 
now placed upon the production of cotton by the necessity of 
picking it by hand; in other words, a man can cultivate more 
cotton than he can pick. If the pneumatic picking machine 
could be perfected so as to supplant hand labor in this opera- 
tion it would effect a revolution in southern agriculture nearly 
as momentous as that which followed the introduction of the 
cotton-gin. The effect upon the labor now used in the cot- 
ton-fields would be no less striking. 
The last quarter of a century has seen the most remarkable
-P-A-G-E-154
  140 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
growth in the cottonseed industry, and in the utilization of . 
the stalks and roots, all of which had previously been re- 
garded as waste products to be disposed of at considerable 
expense. Cottonseed oil, obtained from the seeds, is used in 
making salad oils, oleomargarine, lard, and soap, the meal 
is used as a fertilizer or fed to the stock, and the hulls and 
stalks are used for the same purpose or as fuel and in the 
manufacture of paper; in 1920 southern farmers realized 
$128,000,000 from the sale of cottonseed alone. 
A peculiar feature of cotton production is that it is largely 
in the hands of tenant farmers, about two-thirds of the crop 
being produced by them; about half of the cotton farms are 
in the hands of Negroes. The farms in the hands of Negroes 
are generally small patches sufficient to raise a couple of bales 
of cotton or used for truck farming. The more recent ten- 
dency seems to be to combine small farms into a plantation 
and small plantations into larger plantations. Frequently 
these are under the control of corporations which conduct 
both mercantile and agricultural operations. In spite of the 
fact that the Negroes are in the most fertile sections, the 
average yield of cotton per acre for the negro owner is less 
than for the white owner, who is generally situated on the 
poorer soils. The Negro has shown the greatest efficiency 
in those sections where he has been brought most closely 
under the supervision of the whites. But the improvement 
of southern agriculture, diversification of crops, use of 
fertilizers and improved machinery are in general confined 
to the so-called white counties; the improvement in the means 
of transportation especially has stimulated this movement. 
The high price of cotton during the past few years has been 
of great importance in lifting the cotton planter out of the 
slough of debt and dependence upon store credit. The crop 
lien has almost disappeared, deposits in the banks have in- 
creased, and the farmers have increased their purchases of 
farm machinery and fertilizer. A factor in the elimination 
of the crop lien and of store credit was the growth of small
-P-A-G-E-155
AGRICULTURE AS A BUSINESS 141 
banks with a minimum capital of $25,000, which were 
authorized under the national banking law in 1900; the cot- 
ton planter was financed by these banks instead of by the 
country storekeeper. 
109. The cotton boll weevil. —Southern agriculture has 
been profoundly affected by the depredations of the boll 
weevil, and has undergone a veritable revolution in the past 
thirty years. The beetle migrated from Mexico into Texas in 
1892, and since that time has spread over practically the en- 
tire cotton-growing area of the United States. The female 
weevil lays its eggs in the green bolls, on which the grubs later 
feed, so the bolls either fall off or fail to develop. The de- 
structiveness of the boll weevil and the cost and difficulty of 
combating it have forced the southern farmer in the infested 
regions to give up or reduce the planting of cotton and to 
diversify his crops. This has been so beneficial that the 
effects of the boll weevil cannot be said to have been alto- 
gether bad; indeed, one county in Alabama has erected a 
monument to the boll weevil because it has compelled the 
abandonment of the one-crop system. In the ten leading 
cotton states the acreage planted in cotton decreased over 
2,000,000 acres between 1919 and 1921, or from 38.9 per cent. 
of the whole to 36.1 per cent. At the same time the area 
planted in corn, oats, and hay increased about 4,500,000 acres. 
Production of food for home consumption has greatly in- 
creased in the South. The price of cotton throughout the 
world will undoubtedly be raised as a result of this shift in 
southern agriculture, but it is unlikely that the primacy of 
the South as the chief producer of cotton will be altered. 
110. Live stock.— The raising of cattle for food purposes 
is the most important branch of the live-stock industry; the 
annual beef production of the United States to-day is about 
7,000,000,000 pounds. The raising of live stock is. the pre- 
dominant industry in the semi-arid States of the West, as 
Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Texas. Of recent years 
there has been a movement of live stock from the ranges of
-P-A-G-E-156
  142 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
the far West to smaller farms (under 500 acres) in States. 
immediately west of the Mississippi. Here they are raised 
in small herds, and more attention is.given to breeding. With 
the development of stall feeding the concentrated foods, such 
as corn, have come to be of great importance and they are 
fed to the cattle where they are grown. It is not improbable, 
however, that the-near future will see a development of the 
live stock industry in the East and South as a result of growing 
alfalfa and other special forage crops, of root crops, and of 
breeding varieties of corn, clover, and other crops especially 
adapted to those sections. 
Scarcely second in importance is the production of pork 
and hog products, of which we contribute about one half of 
the world’s supply. It is no mere coincidence that the twelve 
states of the north-central division, which grow almost three 
quarters of the corn, should also produce nearly two thirds 
of the hogs, for corn is the chief food used in fattening the 
animals for market. There is a strong concentration of this 
industry in Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, and Nebraska. 
It is in these States that the great slaughter-houses and meat- 
packing establishments are found, notably in the cities of 
Chicago, Kansas City, and Omaha. Improvements in re- 
frigeration and transportation have caused a great centraliza- 
tion of these industries in a few cities and permitted the 
growth of an immense export trade in meat products, amount- 
ing to about $175,000,000 in 1900 and $635,000,000 in 1920. __ 
The dairy industry, which is quite distinct from the live- 
stock industry, is confined chiefly to the corn-belt and the 
eastern States. This industry has been greatly stimulated 
and transformed by recent developments. Chief among these 
should be named the rise of great markets in our large cities, 
for which it is necessary to furnish a regular and wholesome 
supply; trains carrying only milk are now run to all the 
principal cities, often from great distances, and methods of 
sterilizing, bottling and refrigerating milk have been de- 
veloped. The breeding of cows for milk production has
-P-A-G-E-157
  AGRICULTURE AS A BUSINESS 143 
yielded wonderful results, and the perfecting of the silo, 
whereby good feed is provided. for the animals during the 
winter, has increased the winter supply of milk. 
The poultry business has been almost revolutionized by 
the introduction of the incubator and brooder, which have 
greatly increased the production, and by the application of 
cold storage to both poultry and eggs, thereby equalizing 
their marketing and consumption throughout the year.. New 
demands for eggs have also been created in certain manu- 
facturing processes, such as photography, the manufacture 
of dyes, and the printing of calico. 
111. The need of intensive farming. — In spite of the great 
increase in the products of agriculture the growth of the 
population proceeded so rapidly that by 1900 it had almost © 
caught up with the capacity of the country, under existing 
methods, to produce the needed food supply. Thus, between 
1900 and 1910, the population increased 21 per cent., but the 
cereal production only 1.7 per cent. Our agricultural exports 
declined, as we had less to spare for our neighbors in other 
parts of the world; the exports of wheat, corn, meat, dairy 
products, -and other foodstuffs all fell off. On the other 
hand the increasing demand for agricultural produce could 
no longer be so easily supplied as formerly by merely extend- 
ing the cultivated area westward. The practical exhaustion 
of the supply of arable land in our public domain closed that 
avenue of escape. The United States is now face to face 
with the problem that has confronted all European countries, 
of enlarging the food supply by increasing the production of 
lands already under cultivation. 
The outbreak of the World War in 1914 abruptly changed 
the situation. Owing to the withdrawal in Europe of millions 
of men from productive industry to engage in war it became 
necessary for the belligerent countries to draw a larger part 
of their supplies from the United States. The increased’ 
demand raised prices and much marginal land, hitherto un- 
improved, was brought under cultivation and the output was
-P-A-G-E-158
    144 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
greatly enlarged. When normal activities were resumed 
after the armistice, the European peoples were able to supply 
most of their own needs and the inflated prices of American 
foodstuffs dropped sharply by the end of 1920. Production, 
however, has remained large, and this has forced to the front 
problems of farm organization and management, foremost 
among which is the question as to whether it is desirable to 
substitute intensive cultivation for extensive or exploitative 
farming. 
The American always has been and for the most part still 
is a “cheap land” farmer, who has economized labor but. 
has used land prodigally, alweys ready to desert old land 
for new. It is significant that there has been increasing 
resort to careful and exact farming with the cessation of free 
homesteading on the public domain on a large scale. The 
American farmer of the future will be compelled, as land 
increases in price, to resort to more intensive cultivation. 
Little, however, has as yet been done along these lines: thus 
if we compare the average crop yield for the period 1890- 
1911 with that for 1866-1889 we find that for the entire 
United States the yield of wheat was increased by 14 bushels 
per acre; but the average yield of corn was decreased by one- 
half bushel: During the next decade, 1911-1920, under the 
stimulus of war prices, the production of wheat was increased 
nearly one bushel per acre, and that of corn about 14 bushels 
per acre. That virgin soil rather than improved methods has 
been responsible for maintaining our wheat yield is made 
clear when we notice that nearly half of the wheat crop of the 
United States is produced in the five states of Kansas, 
Nebraska, Washington, and the Dakotas. 
The necessity for more intensive cultivation has involved 
a change in agricultural practice and methods, and the transi- 
tion is not easily made by those trained under easier con- 
ditions. Instead of the repeated cultivation of one staple crop, 
systems of cropping have been worked out; scientific rotation 
is used to prevent the exhaustion of the soil. Once it was
-P-A-G-E-159
AGRICULTURE AS A BUSINESS 145 
     
    
   
        
   
     
     
      
    
    
     
     
      
      
    
      possible to point to the corn, wheat, rye, and cotton belts, 
where a massing of each crop took place regardless of local 
circumstances. But to-day these great aggregations of 
similar crops are being broken up, and local specialization is 
becoming the rule. The old practice of self-sustaining farm- 
ing is also being promoted, especially in the West, as a result 
of the high freight rates, which make it less profitable for 
farmers to grow crops for distant markets or to bring in 
supplies from outside. As a result, they are diversifying their 
farming and raising more supplies for their own consumption. 
It is now necessary for a feeder to grow his own feed, and for 
the dairyman to rely less on shipped-in grain and forage. 
The nearness of a good market has become more important 
than the fertility of the soil in determining land values. 
112. Irrigation and reclamation.— The exhaustion of the 
soil under the old single crop system and the great increase in 
the population have led to a demand for conservation, for 
reclamation, for agricultural education, and for other remedies 
to prevent'a further rise in prices. The program of conser- 
vation involves a problem so much larger than the preserva- 
tion of our agricultural resources merely, that a full discussion 
of this must be deferred to a separate chapter. It has been 
forced to the front by a recognition of the fact that a lessening 
of waste in the exploitation of our natural resources is neces- 
sary. Looked at from another point of view the problem 
presents itself as the better utilization of our resources, the 
intelligent development and not the destruction of our soil, 
our forests, and our fisheries. We shall confine ourselves here 
to the consideration of the first of these. 
There remain of the public domain in the United States 
about 842,000,000 acres, practically all of which is in the arid 
zone. With the expansion of the population and the taking 
up of all the fertile public lands, the problem of reclaiming 
the arid plains of the western States has begun to attract 
attention. Nearly two fifths of the territory of the United 
‘States has an annual rainfall of less than twenty inches, and
-P-A-G-E-160
ee a eR Te Te ee ee 
146 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
is thereby reduced to a condition of sterility, except for graz- 
ing purposes, unless it can be artificially provided with the 
necessary moisture. Much of this land is exceedingly fertile, 
but cannot be cultivated except where it is brought under 
irrigation. This arid belt includes the eight States of Mon- 
tana, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, .Arizona, 
and New Mexico, and parts of several other adjoining States. 
  Trrication DircHes 
At the upper end of each ditch it is usual to construct some device by 
which the amount of water entering from the river can be regulated 
and its fair share distributed to each ditch. The effect of irrigation 
has been marvelous in reclaiming and developing the arid and semi- 
arid sections of the country. 
Although irrigation had been practised in America from 
time immemorial by the Indians, only a few hundred acres 
were being irrigated when, in 1847, the Mormons began their 
experiments in Utah. By 1870 there may have been 20,000: 
acres under irrigation in the United States, but the next decade 
was one of rapid construction of small ditches by individuals 
and associations of farmers, and by 1880 the irrigated territory 
had grown to not less than 1,000,000 acres. “ In the decade 
1880 to 1890 occurred the ‘boom’ of speculative enterprise 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
AGRICULTURE AS A BUSINESS 147 
in irrigation canals. Large sums of money were obtained for 
irrigation works by the sale of stocks and bonds, and great 
enterprises were projected. . ... Nearly all of these failed of 
financial success. . .. In 1889 there were 3,631,381 acres 
irrigated... . During the following decade the irrigated 
acreage doubled in extent. This has been due rather to the 
extension and enlargement of the many canals existing in 
1889 and to the more complete practice of irrigation on the 
lands then under ditch than to the construction of new and 
large systems of irrigation.”+ In 1910 there were 13,738,485 
acres under irrigation, from which were raised crops, chiefly 
hay and forage and vegetables, with a value of $181,617,496. 
By 1920 the acreage under irrigation had increased to 19,191,~ 
716 acres, which produced crops valuec at $758,000,000. 
While most of the work done hitherto has been carried out by 
private initiative, a demand has recently arisen for irrigation 
at government expense, in response to which Congress in 1902 
provided for the gradual building of irrigation works out of 
the proceeds of the sales of public lands. Regulation of the 
use of the limited water-supply, either by State or Federal 
authority, is essential to the success of irrigation. 
Attention has recently been directed to the project of 
draining the vast swampy region that stretches along the 
Atlantic coast almost continuously from New Jersey to 
Florida. It is estimated that 80,000,000 acres could be drained 
and made available for cultivation; this would support a 
population of 10,000,000 people. These comprehensive irri- 
gation and drainage schemes must be carried out by the 
government, and considerable has already been done along 
this line. The latest demand upon the Federal government 
has been for the establishment of a corps of trained men 
to visit the farmers of the country and instruct them in the 
principles of soil fertility, waste, and conservation. It is 
urged that such a service will reclaim a large part of the 
900,000 square miles of depleted cultivable land in the East, : 
1 Twelfth census, VI, 801.  
-P-A-G-E-162
148 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
and is of more importance than opening up small areas of 
new land to cultivation. This demand only emphasizes the 
need of increased education along agricultural lines, and to 
this we may turn. Here would seem to lie the ultimate 
solution of the problem of increased productivity. 
113. Agricultural education.— An important step in the 
reorganization of American agriculture was the grant of 
Federal support to the agricultural experiment stations in 
1887. There had been State stations before this, but now 
they were co-ordinated, their number increased, and their 
activities enlarged. By them science has been applied to agri- 
cultural problems, experiments carried on, and the results 
disseminated among the farmers. Their influence is already ° 
far-reaching, and will become increasingly important. It is 
estimated that the North Dakota station added to the wealth 
of that State ten million dollars a year for a decade by the 
better development of cereals. The Federal government is 
appropriating about one and one half millions of dollars a 
year for this work, and the States somewhat more. Most of 
these stations are situated at the agricultural colleges, which 
are to be found in every state and territory in the Union. The 
number of students in these institutions is steadily growing, 
and an increasing number of their graduates is going back to 
. the farms equipped with a knowledge of scientific agriculture. 
This is taught as a science as well as an art, and the student 
is given a general education in farming methods. Agricul- 
tural education is also being carried down into the secondary 
schools; and with the passage in 1917 of the Smith-Hughes 
Act, granting Federal funds to high schools for instruction in 
agriculture, we may expect to see a great expansion along 
these lines. Lately, railroads, millers, grain dealers, and 
others interested in the development of agriculture have co- 
operated to bring the instruction of the schools and colleges 
as near to the farmer as possible by means of special lectures, 
with moving laboratories. 
Another important kind of work along these lines has been
-P-A-G-E-163
AGRICULTURE AS A BUSINESS 149 
‘earried on by the Department of Agriculture. The bureau 
of plant industry has men searching for new plants in every 
quarter of the globe, and determining whether they are prac- 
tical and desirable for introduction into the United States. 
During the single year 1904 nearly fifteen hundred new kinds 
of seeds and plants were introduced into this country, in- 
cluding species especially adapted to the arid regions. Other 
bureaus, which are performing equally valuable service, but 
which can only be mentioned, are those of forestry, 
weather, entomology, animal industry, chemistry, and the 
more recent bureaus of agricultural economics and markets. 
The results of the Department’s work are brought to the 
farmers through the experiment stations, by its agents, and by 
various publications. As the application of the principles of 
experimental science to agriculture becomes more systematic 
and more general, no profession will require a more thorough 
scientific training than this. 
An equally significant movement has taken place recently 
along the lines, not of governmental encouragement, but of 
self-help, and has led to agricultural codperation. In manu- 
facturing and commercial enterprises there has long been a 
tendency toward closer organization, but farming has been 
slow to avail itself of this principle. Now, however, agricul- 
tural codperative organizations have been established for 
buying farm supplies, for marketing farm products, and for 
obtaining credit. The most noteworthy successes have been 
achieved in the selling of fruit, grain, milk, and some other 
commodities, of which the California Fruit Growers’ Ex- 
change may be cited as an example, and especially in the 
establishment of codperative elevator companies, which are 
now to be found in the central and northwestern states. In 
1919 codperative marketing and purchases amounting to 
$721,983,639 were effected through farmers’ organizations. 
By means of these organizations the farmers aim to maintain 
more stable prices by releasing their stocks gradually instead 
of flooding the markets immediately after harvest.

SUGGESTIVE TOPICS AND QUESTIONS. CHAPTER VIII 
Although the old system of wasteful, extensive agriculture has by 
no means come to an end in the United States, a new era has come in 
this field. The growth of population has created a greater demand 
for food and other products, higher prices have caused a better utiliza- 
tion of the land, and stimulated a greater production. All this has 
meant better technique, more accurate knowledge, the substitution of 
science for rule of thumb. The problems of agriculture are problems 
of organization, of marketing and credit, and of education.

6. Why do not other countries raise their own cotton instead of 
importing it from the United States? 
7. In 1905 some of the cotton planters agreed to burn part of their 
crop in order to keep the price up. Was this economically desirable?

CHAPTER IX 
CONCLUSIONS 
114. The concentration of wealth.— The record of the 
economic development of the American people has been one 
of steady growth in national strength and material wealth. 
Before concluding this survey, however, it will be desirable 
to ascertain if possible to whom this vast increase of wealth 
is going. The situation at the beginning of the twentieth cen- 
tury may be stated somewhat: as follows: We have large 
natural resources of every sort needed in modern production; 
a working population of some 25,000,000 persons, many highly 
trained; a supply of active capital of not less than $50,000,- 
000,000; a highly efficient organization of industry, transpor- 
tation, and finance, which permits the most economical pro- 
duction and exchange of commodities; and finally, political 
and social conditions which are’ distinctly favorable to the 
production and acquisition of wealth. It is certainly per- 
tinent to inquire, not merely what this combination of re- 
sources, labor, capital, and skill is effecting in the way of 
production, but also how the vast output is being distributed. 
Equality of conditions and the wide diffusion of wealth have 
long been the boast of our Republic; are they less true to-day 
than they were fifty or one hundred years ago? In the half 
century, 1850-1910, the per capita value of all } roperty in 
the country _has more than _q d; how ‘hae this been 
distributed? While no absolutely exact statistics exist on this 
subject, yet reliable estimates by scientific students all teil 
the same story —of concentration of wealth in the hands 
of the richest groups. The character of the changes which 
have taken place in the last seventy-five years of the nine- 
teenth century is perhaps best shown in a study of probated 
152
-P-A-G-E-167
CONCLUSIONS 153 
estates in Massachusetts, made by the State Bureau of Statis- 
ties of Labor. 
This gave the amount of wealth that was probated at dif- 
ferent periods, classified according to the size of the estates 
that were left. If we represent the percentages of the total 
wealth probated at each period by graphs, in which the length 
of the lines represents the percentage in each: class, and the 
thickness of the lines represents the relation of the totals 
from one period to another, we shall obtain a clearer idea of 
the changes that have taken place than we could get from a 
mere table of figures. It will be seen that in the period 1829- 
31 the branches of the tree-like figure are broadest near the 
base, while the reverse is true for the period 1889-91. That 
is, a larger proportion of the probated wealth was in small 
estates of not over $5000 in 1830 than in 1890, while in the 
latter period the largest single group was that of estates of 
$500,000 and over. This would seem to indicate an increasing 
concentration of wealth in the hands of the richest men. 
But another significant feature of the graphs is the fact that 
the top branches tend to grow longer at the expense of the 
lower branches, showing a tendency for all the estates to be-

rather than wealth was made the subject of this investigation, 
and the conclusion was reached that 86 per cent. of the gain- 
fully employed in 1918 received about 60 per cent. of the na- 
tional income, while 14 per cent of those employed received 
the remaining 40 per cent.,of the income. The total national 
income for this year was estimated at $61,000,000,000, which 
would yield a per capita income of $586. Both of these 
figures are unduly high as they are figured in terms of 
an inflated currency, but even when reduced to a pre-war 
level both figures are higher than those of any other country. 
115. Economic loss through inequitable distribution. — It 
is evident that we have moved a long distance from the demo- 
cratic conditions of comparative economic equality that ex- 
isted seventy-five or one hundred years ago. “Swollen 
fortunes ” are a phenomenon of the twentieth century. But, 
it may be asked, wherein lies the evil of inequality, since 
society as a whole has undoubtedly gained in wealth? Indeed, 
some writers argue that this very inequality is a necessary 
stimulus to economic production. Without attempting to argue 
the point, certain economic losses that result from grossly in- 
equitable distribution of wealth may be pointed out. The 
great fortunes of the United States have been made possible 
by the unrivaled opportunities for the exploitation of natural 
resources, the appropriation of natural monopolies, and the 
development of new lines of trade and manufactures. Many 
of the natural resources have been monopolized by a few, 
who have become wealthy with the growth of population and 
the consequent increase in demand. Situated at strategic 
points in the industrial world, they have exacted tribute of 
society, much as the robber barons of old. And in this 
they have been greatly helped by receiving discriminating 
favors from railroads and other natural monopolies, through 
which their position has been greatly strengthened against 
possible competitors. Under such circumstances the growth 
of their wealth has not measured either the efficient utilization 
of the resources of the continent, or the greatest social gain
-P-A-G-E-170

| from their use. Increased production has not infrequently 
been attended by increased inequality in distribution. On the 
’ other hand, it must be emphasized that the wonderful oppor- 
tunities, which the United States has in general opened to 
ability and talent, have spurred the virile and capable to the 
fullest development of their native powers. These- persons 
have in most instances earned their large rewards and have 
conferred upon society even greater benefits. 
Inequitable distribution generally means poor economy and 
low efficiency in the work of production. While on the one- 
hand there has developed in this country a splendid type of 
business organizer, called forth by the very conditions of 
industry, on the other are to be noted the wastes of overwork, 
child labor, sweating, industrial disease, preventable acci- 
dents, slums, etc. A better organization of industry and 
distribution of wealth would prevent many of these and would 
raise the general standard.of efficiency. Gross inequality also 
means lessened pleasure in the consumption of wealth. What 
is needed is not merely more wealth, but. wealth so distributed 
that the economic gratifications of society would be maxi- 
mized. The sum total of economic satisfactions will be greater 
in a society in which there is fair equality of distribution than 
in one where the millionaire is jostled by the tramp. There is 
finally an inconsistency, not to say a danger, in a society 
which is politically democratic, but economically plutocratic. 
116. Needed reforms. — It is easier to criticise than to sug- 
gest remedies, but certain conclusions seem irresistible. So far 
as the problem can be solved by means of legislation, this 
should be used to prevent monopoly. Not only this, but 
society should also assert its right to all unearned values by 
ownership, by special taxation, or other methods. Special 
privilege must be prohibited and so far as possible the door of 
opportunity kept open for all alike. Limited natural resources 
must be saved to society, and this should be done by the 
means that seem most feasible under the particular circum- 
stances, whether this be government ownership, regulation,  
-P-A-G-E-171
CONCLUSIONS 157 
fixation of rates, or assistance. More important than legis- 
lation, however, in the ultimate solution of this as of most 
problems, is education. By means of better education in- 
creased individual efficiency must be secured and economy 
in national production augmented. Increased production is 
necessary as a condition to better distribution. Education in 
consumption, in the art of spending, is hardly less necessary, 
both to prevent waste and to achieve greater economic sat- 
isfactions from existing wealth. This may be secured by 
greater wisdom in the expenditure of his income by each indi- 
vidual, by the greater socialization of wealth, as in the form of 
libraries, art galleries, parks, etc., and by the shortening of 
the working day, whereby leisure, one of the greatest boons 
of civilization, will be more generally distributed. We may 
trust to education to teach the best use of this leisure. 
Among all the reforms suggested the one which would 
probably yield the largest immediate improvement in eco- 
nomic conditions is the more rational expenditure of income. 
If the positively harmful and also the relatively frivolous ex- 
penditures were eliminated from our budgets, there could be 
produced and consumed more things which would contribute 
to economic efficiency and would raise the standard of living. 
A current estimate places the expenditures in the United 
States in 1921 for luxuries at $22,700,000,000. To be sure 
the word “ luxuries ” is made to include a good many articles 
of consumption, such as cake and candy, ice cream, face 
powder, furs, and similar things, which contain some real 
utility and would have to be replaced by other consumable ar- 
ticles, if discarded. But even allowing for exaggeration it 
undoubtedly remains true that great economies could be ef- 
fected by wiser expenditures. 
117. Summary: The colonial period.— The new world 
seems to have been reserved in all its wonderful richness of 
undeveloped resources for settlement by the Anglo-Saxon race. 
The aborigines who were found in the country at the first 
coming of the white man had not advanced far enough in
-P-A-G-E-172
  158 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
civilization to exploit the mineral or agricultural wealth, but 
subsisted largely by the chase or by a primitive agriculture 
which barely scratched the surface of the soil. Although 
other nations were first on the scene they finally yielded the 
title of the continent of North America to the English. The 
motives which sent the early colonists to these shores were 
effective in selecting the most venturesome, energetic, and 
liberty-loving for the work of settlement. During the colonial 
period the work of the colonists was a constant struggle with 
nature, the hewing of homes out of the forest, and the develop- 
ment of the wilderness. The industries of the colonists were 
determined largely by their environment and were scarcely a 
matter of choice; agriculture was of necessity the most im- 
portant single industry, supplemented in New England and 
the middle colonies by fishing and commerce. While manu- 
factures were early attempted, they were never developed far. 
Partly responsible for this was the restrictive commercial 
policy of England towards the colonies, which made their 
interests subordinate to those of the mother country. 
Although the work of the colonists involved unremitting toil 
and hard conditions, they were never carried away by mate- 
rialism. From the beginning the American people have had 
ideals and have sought earnestly to realize them. They have 
not been swept on blindly by the forces of nature, but have 
deliberately sought to realize certain political, social, and 
economic ideals. In the simple conditions of an undeveloped 
agricultural community their realization seemed compara- 
tively easy. While the accumulation of wealth was as yet 
slight, it was distributed fairly equally, and poverty was al- 
most unknown. There was abundant opportunity for all who 
would exert themselves, and to labor itself there attached no 
social stigma. Widespread economic well-being characterized 
the end of the period. 
118. Summary: The struggle for freedom. — The colonial 
period was brought to a close by the revolt of the colonies 
against the restrictive and irritating economic policy of Eng-

  CONCLUSIONS ~ 159 
land. Political independence, however, was not followed im- 
mediately by either commercial or economic independence. 
Another war was necessary before the first was secured, while 
the second can hardly be said to have been attained until the 
second quarter of the nineteenth century. The economic de- 
velopment of the country after the Revolution followed in 
the main the same course which had characterized it before 
During this period the carrying-trade was developed to an 
extraordinary degree, while the foreign demand for our agri- 
cultural staples also gave a great stimulus to agriculture. A 
beginning was made in manufactures, but these industries 
were confined as yet to the household. As during the colonial 
’ period, so also during the thirty years following the Declara- 
tion of Independence, the economic policy of the new States 
and later of the Union was largely dependent upon that of 
England and of Europe. The face of the American people was 
turned to the Atlantic and their gaze was directed across it. 
From this colonial attitude they were first rudely shaken by 
the embargo and later by the War of 1812, which mark an im- 
portant industrial transition in the economic life of the nation. . 
119. Summary: The westward movement. — The restrictive 
period inaugurated by the embargo, during which foreign in- 
tercourse was almost completely cut off, introduced an in- 
dustrial revolution which gradually transferred the textile 
and other manufacturing industries from the household to the 
factory. By the time of the Civil War the transition had been 
almost completely accomplished. More significant, however, 
and more important in the life of the growing nation, was the 
westward movement of the population. The great task of 
the American people, of appropriating and settling the vast 
territory to the west of the Alleghanies, was now undertaken 
on a large scale. Hand in hand with the westward movement, 
as a part of it, went the exploitation of the undeveloped re- 
sources of the country, the expansion and improvement of’ 
agriculture, and above all, the development of improved means 
of transportation and communication.

160 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
This period marks the emergence of a strong national feel- 
ing. For the first time the American people turned their back 
on the Atlantic and developed a commercial policy which 
looked to economic as well as political independence of 
Europe. The Monroe Doctrine was simply the political state- 
ment of the economic situation and policy, though the terri- 
torial phase was primarily emphasized in the debates on this 
subject. The problems of this period were internal and do- 
mestic: the disposition of the public lands, the encouragement 
of internal improvements, the protection of manufactures, the 
building up of the merchant marine, and above all, the ques- 
tion of slavery. The material prosperity of the country and 
the growing economic integration of the different sections were 
, threatened by the existence of this institution. The dictum 
| of Lincoln, that “this country camot endure half slave and 
half free,” was as true economically ‘as it was politically. The 
unwillingness of the people to permit the further extension of 
slavery led finally to the Civil War and to the abolition of 
the institution. 
As a whole the period was one of marvelous material ex- 
pansion and prosperity. The prodigality of nature, the big- 
ness of the country, and the character of their work led to the 
exhibition of some of the less desirable traits of the American 
people. But, while their manners were often rude, the heart 
and conscience of the nation were right. Economic well-being 
was widespread and poverty was rare outside of the larger 
cities, but already complaints were heard of labor troubles, 
of the increasing power of monopolies and corporations, and 
of the growing concentration of wealth. 
120. Summary: The rise of industrialism.— The end of 
the Civil War found the different sections of the country 
in different stages of economic development and confronted 
with varying problems. The South was left with a peculiar 
problem of its own. A new generation of free laborers had to 
be trained up to take the place of the former slaves, as these 
died off. That, and the exploitation of the untouched natural  
-P-A-G-E-175
  CONCLUSIONS 161 
wealth of this section, is the task of the South, upon whose 
solution she is now entering with the vigor of a young people. 
In the West the free land had been practically all taken up, 
and the future will probably see there the application of a more 
intensive agriculture and the slow, steady, non-dramatic ex- 
tension of other interests —the growth of the population, of 
cities, and of manufacturing industries. 
The industrial development of the central and eastern States 
is already far advanced, and with this growing industrialism 
have emerged numerous problems. The transference of manu- 
factures from the household to the factory has been completely 
effected, and the factory has grown in size and complexity. 
Large-scale production characterizes the manufactures, trans- 
portation, and distribution of most of the products of the 
country. With the expansion of industry beyond the limits 
of a local market, its organization on a larger scale became 
imperative. The formation of corporations and trusts’has been 
one answer to this demand; the trust is a temporary form, 
but the organization of capital in larger masses is a permanent 
result of this movement. Association and codperation are 
types of an advanced stage of economic development, and 
it is highly desirable that the benefits of these should be se- 
cured, while avoiding the evils of monopoly. Hand in hand 
with the organization of capital has gone that of labor. The 
organization of industry on a large scale, with expensive ma- 
chinery has resulted in the growth of a wage-earning class; 
these workers have organized on a national scale and enforced 
their demands with fairly steady success. The changed char- 
acter of immigration has complicated the labor situation and 
has brought the question of its further restriction to the 
front. 
Having settled the most pressing domestic problems result- 
ing from the Civil War, the country has now directed its 
attention to the invasion of European markets. The industrial 
development of the country has been such as to permit not 
merely the satisfaction of domestic needs, but: also the expor-
-P-A-G-E-176
    162 ECONOMIC HISTORY OF AMERICAN AGRICULTURE 
tation of surplus manufactured goods. Again the American 
people may be said to have faced the Atlantic and directed 
their gaze towards Europe; the near future will undoubtedly 
see a change in their commercial policy corresponding to this 
altered economic attitude. ‘ 
121. Summary: Economic integration. — The abolition of 
slavery permitted harmonious economic coédperation between 
the different sections of the country; and the last quarter cen- 
tury has seen rapid progress toward the complete industrial 
integration of the whole country. As interests have become 
larger, sectional divergencies have been lost in the growing 
unity of the greater whole. With the growth of the transpor- 
tation system and the expansion of the population, industries 
have outgrown the narrow limits of local-communities and 
even States or sections, and have become national in scope and 
importance. The problems have therefore been shifted largely 
from the local to the national arena, and the agencies of con- 
trol have necessarily become those of the Federal government, 
a movement which has been hastened by the expansion of 
Federal powers during the World War. Never before was 
the question of governmental regulation of private industries 
more important. True economic freedom, the equal oppor- 
tunity of all in the race for wealth, can be obtained only by 
the enforcement of law and conservative control. While an 
unrestrained policy of laissez faire has permitted the growth of 
some undesirable features in the political, social, and economic 
organism, there are many and hopeful indications at present 
not merely of the recognition of the need of public regulation, 
but of its actual application. There is also a growing sense of 
responsibility on the part of the average citizen and man of 
wealth. The great problem of the present in the United States 
is no longer that of appropriating the natural resources, but 
of the wise use and administration of the great wealth of the 
country by those in whose ownership it rests. 
There has been an enormous increase of wealth during this 
period, but there has been also a disproportionate concentra-
-P-A-G-E-177
  CONCLUSIONS 163 
tion of wealth in the hands of a few. Old world problems of 
poverty — from which we had hoped we were happily free — 
have emerged in our cities, where destitution and vice have 
been localized and brought before the public gaze. On the 
whole, however, the present probably -sees as wide and general * 
a diffusion of plenty as any previous time in our national 
history. The future holds great promise and also grave 
responsibility for the wise and conservative solution of these 
far-reaching economic problems. 
SUGGESTIVE TOPICS AND QUESTIONS. CHAPTER IX 
1. Is the concentration of wealth a desirable thing? [C. B. Spahr, 
Distribution of Wealth in the U. S.; G. K. Holmes, Concentration of 
Wealth, in Pol. Sci. Quart., 1893; W. E. Weyl, The New Democracy, 
139-155.] 
2. Enumerate the economic causes of large fortunes. [G. P. Wat- 
’ kins, Growth of Large Fortunes; A. Youngman, Economic Causes of 
Great Fortunes.] 
8. Are the rich growing richer, and the poor, poorer? [C. D. Wright, 
Pract. Soc., 343-9; Ibid. in Atl. Mo., LXXX, 300; The Concentration 
of Wealth (symposium), in Independent, May 1, 1902; A. J. Ferris, 
Pauperizing the Rich.] 
4. In a speech in April, 1906, President Roosevelt said: “As a matter 
of personal conviction, and without pretending to discuss the details or 
formulate the system, I feel that we shall ultimately have to consider 
the adoption of some such scheme as that of a progressive tax on all 
‘fortunes, beyond a certain amount, either given in life or devised or be- 
queathed upon death to any individual—a tax so framed as to put 
it out of the power of the owner of one of these enormous fortunes to 
hand on more than a certain amount to any one individual.” Dis- 
cuss this.

  ADMINISTRATION OF INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES 
. By EDWARD D. JONES, 
Formerly Professor of Commerce and Industry, 
University of Michigan. . 
Crown 8v0. 449 pages 
The purpose of the work is to present what may be called 
first-class practice in the administration of industrial enterprises. 
The manufacturing industry is the one which has been held in 
mind chiefly. 
The major topics, in the order of their presentation are (1) 
the problem of equipment; (2) the formation of an administrative 
organization; (3) the adjustment of the relations of capital and 
labor; (4) the process of mercantile distribution. 
In the discussion of equipment, it has been necessary to skirt 
the borders of a vast field of technical knowledge, choosing such 
matter as the general executive should possess in his attempt to 
supervise the work of technical experts. 
With reference to administrative organization, the aim has 
been to bring the contributions of scientific management into 
relation with the general body of underlying principles of ad- 
ministration which are valid for all forms of joint action; and 
to do so by sketching the evolution of administrative practice 
rather than by a review of pure principles. 
In treating the relations of capital and labor, the author has 
presented the labor problem from the employing manager’s point 
of view, and has elaborated somewhat the meaning of the new 
philanthropy which aims to bring to the less favored classes a 
fuller measure of the rational objects of life, through the or- 
ganized and normal processes of industry. 
The methods of mercantile distribution are presented in out- 
line, without entering upon a criticism of the vast, wastes entailed 
by the modern evolution, since it is customary to separate the 
discussion of industrial organization from that of. commercial 
organization. i 
Throughout, two things have been kept in view: to trace the 
application of the scientific method in industry, and to point out 
the efficiency and charm of an economic policy based upon wel- 
fare and service.

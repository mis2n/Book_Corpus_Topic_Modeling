  PREFACE 
“T want to teach my children, but am I really clever | 
enough to be a teacher?” 
It is not the cleverest teacher, but the best teacher, 
that the home needs. A great linguist may be totally 
unable to make others learn the elements of a language, 
a great musician may lack every single qualification as a 
teacher of beginners. It is not merely cleverness or a 
knack of arousing enthusiasm that marks the good 
teacher, not high scholarship nor commanding intellect, 
but patience and perseverance in making children do the 
same things day after day, exactly so. It is this making 
that is the backbone of education. 
The child who is sent to school before learning to 
obey, to pay attention, to apply himself, is for the time 
being unteachable. No school can entirely repair the 
damage wrought by wrong training or neglect during 
the first seven years of life. 
Here is a test of the mother’s ability to conduct her 
own kindergarten: 
Can you teach your children the Lord’s Prayer? 
Can you teach them to sew on buttons? to tie a 
knot? to set the table? to use a broom? to draw a 
straight line? 
Can you teach them the names of the birds that visit 
your yard? the trees and flowers growing near your 
home? the common garden vegetables? the six basic 
colors? 
Can you teach them Mother Goose rhymes?

Can you make them think of the question asked be-

things as they are and describe exactly what they see? 
If you can do these things, or can learn to do them, 
you can also learn to do the other things that will be 
required of the Teacher-Mother.

BOOKLESS LESSONS FOR -THE 
TEACHER-MOTHER 
CHAPTER: 1 
THE TEACHER-MOTHER’S OPPORTUNITY 
For every child born into the world his work is 
waiting, humble, perhaps, but a part of the great plan; 
with each is born his special gift, to be developed by 
education into that lifework. This guidebook is writ- 
ten in the belief that within each child’s environment 
lies the means of educating him, and that with the 
parents, whether rich or poor, learned or simple, rest 
the privilege and responsibility of so ordering the home 
that it becomes for their children the greatest educa- 
tional institution in the world. 
To do this it is necessary for the parents to under- 
stand something of the laws of human nature, just as 
it is a lawyer’s business to know the civil law and a 
physician’s to know Nature’s laws with regard to the 
proper functioning of the human body. A man of 
sense does not undertake even the making of a garden, 
the building of a house, or the running of an engine 
until he understands at least the elements of the project 
and has studied the practices of others, in order to 
ascertain the most common causes of success and fail- 
ure, for only a wastrel would experiment unnecessarily 
with materials that could not be duplicated, Especially 
I

must we be on our guard in the field of child culture, 
where the materials are too delicate and costly and the 
effects too far-reaching for rash or unguided experi- 
mentation. A false blow of the sculptor’s chisel means 
merely the spoiling of a block of marble, whereas the 
result of the parents’ error or incompetence may mean 
the spoiling of an immortal soul. Men and women 
are what they are because the home either trained them 
in the right way or failed in that responsibility. The 
school cannot remodel the child who has been given a 
wrong start at home. 
This book is a calendar of certain things that can 
and should be done in training children before it is 
time to put a book into their hands. It does not pro- 
fess to include everything of this nature, the mother’s 
intelligence being taken for granted. The list of ques- 
tions which mothers most frequently ask me has served 
as my guide as to the poirits emphasized. No attempt 
is made to be novel or highly original, but only to keep 
the road open in the right direction, so that it may be 
easier for parents to go right than wrong. 
One of the most pernicious blunders of modern times 
is putting a book into the child’s hands before he is 
ready for the lessons it contains. Children who have 
been carefully trained at home can do easily in two 
years the school work that other children can scarcely 
accomplish in three or four. Such lessons as are out- 
lined here make the children so eager to learn that 
thereafter method is of little consequence. Hence we 
shall deal briefly and informally with some of the things 
parents need to know about child nature, and with 
simple, unpretentious ways of tilling, planting, and 
cultivating these little gardens of Eden. Throughout, 
 
-P-A-G-E-11
  The Teacher-Mother’s Opportunity 3 
we shall base instruction on the theory that after birth 
education, and not heredity, is the controlling factor, 
that during the years of early childhood individual 
instruction and sane discipline are the best and indeed 
the only guarantee of lasting success. 
We shall not seek to turn normal children into abnor- 
mal ones by preparing them for college at the age of 
ten, but instead try to show how the best things gained 
in a college course, such as the ability to persist in 
hard work until the assignment is mastered, can and 
should be acquired before the age of ten. I have no 
advice to offer on the turning of children into prodi- 
gies. Personally, I do not want to live with a prodigy. 
It is best to keep close to Mother Earth, and pray that 
you may never raise a prodigy of anything but hon- 
esty, faithfulness, truth, industry, sober-mindedness, 
sympathetic fellow-feeling towards fellow men. 
I do not want mothers to take as their ideal the 
advertisement of a certain, university: “This is where 
we take a bootblack and turn him into a doctor.” In 
the universal scheme, a good bootblack, if that be his 
calling, or a good ditch-digger, comes as near to ful- 
filling the divine intent as a good ambassador, and much 
nearer than a poor one. As Jeanie Carlyle asked her- 
self: “After all, in the sight of the Upper Powers, 
what is the mighty difference between a statue of Per- 
seus and a loaf of bread, so that each be the thing one’s 
hand has found to do?” 
Much that I am saying is said from the angle of a 
teacher who has struggled with ‘‘failures,” and tried 
to find out why bright children do so often fail. This 
is one generalization I shall venture to make: the small- 
est percentage of school failures comes from old-  
-P-A-G-E-12
  4 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
fashioned homes where old-fashioned discipline and 
training prevail, that same old and time-honored disci- 
pline and training to which humanity owes the greater 
portion of its progress, civilization, and culture. 
Some of the facts that I wish to bring to the atten- 
tion of parents are these: There is no such thing as a 
born criminal; parents cannot escape responsibility by 
blaming badness on a remote ancestor; all children are 
naughty, but no child is bad; all children will be good 
children when mothers train them in good habits from 
early infancy; failure in making a living or making 
life worth while are mainly traceable to parental igno- 
rance or negligence; knowledge alone is not a safe- 
guard against wrongdoing; backwardness among 
school children as well as stupidity among grown peo- 
ple are often the result of wrong home training or the 
lack of any sort of home training; a large proportion 
of feeble-mindedness is the result of neglect or mis- 
directed training between the ages of three and seven; 
genius is native intelligence supported by a disciplined 
body and controlled by a disciplined mind; the ill- 
guided home is responsible for most of the existing 
depravity, criminality, and feeble-mindedness, so that 
the child is denied an approach to noble self-control 
and threatened with an utter absence of will power in 
the exact degree to which his home life is disordered. 
It is as unnatural to deny careful instruction to chil- 
dren, however young, as it would be to withhold from 
them their necessary food, and this care of the child’s 
mind is just as much the duty of parents as is the care 
of his soul and body. Unfortunately, the term educa- 
tion is confused with schooling, instruction, and book 
knowledge, and is used more often in a wrong than in
-P-A-G-E-13
  The Teacher-Mother’s Opportunity 5 
the right sense, a confusion for which schoolmen are 
probably chiefly to blame. Note the present general 
use of the word “educator” instead of instructor, pro- 
fessor, superintendent, teacher. We have commission- 
ers of education, boards of education, departments of 
education, when the correct term is “public instruc- 
tion.” I venture to assert that this misuse of the word 
has a wider influence for evil than any similar verbal 
blunder of the age. The school never was and never 
can be the chief factor in human education, and to 
rely upon it as such is one of the most far-reaching 
errors of the modern social system, for schooling, or 
any other form of instruction outside the home, is 
only one part of education. One might as well confuse 
grafting with orchardry, potato-peeling with cooking 
a dinner. 
Many of our great men and women were either 
educated without schooling, or else were school fail- 
ures. Most of the present generation are being over- 
schooled and undereducated. Now the parents are the 
true educators, whereas the teachers are the teachers. 
The home is the only institution that is in itself strictly/ 
’ an educational institution. The church and the school 
can each help, but the home and the home only can 
educate. 
It is likely that mothers would approach the task of 
child-training with more confidence if schoolmen would 
only express themselves in plain language, such as the 
great poets and philosophers used when they talked of 
lovely things, like childhood, and sunsets, and storms 
at sea. Socrates, the father of logic, could use words 
that were simple enough for a young child to read and 
spell, even when he was setting traps for the vain-
-P-A-G-E-14
  
  6 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
glorious wise ones of Athens, but peep into a modern 
book on the training of children and you meet a 
bristling array of Greek derivatives that seem to say: 
“Thus far, and no farther. Confine your motherly 
activities to child-feeding and neck-washing. Leave 
psychology to the pedagogues.” 
One of our psychologists, in the desire to let the 
public know what the inside of a child’s head is like, 
had constructed a whole book out of phrases only a 
degree less obscure and forbidding than the sacred 
writings on an Egyptian obelisk. At the family dinner 
table he expressed his gratification that his work was 
now being translated into Chinese, whereupon his son 
asked: “‘Say, dad, why don’t you get some one to trans- 
late it into English?” Strip from psychology its deter- 
ring mask by calling it knowledge of human nature and 
ask yourself how much the mother of a growing family 
is likely to learn about this subject from a psychologist 
who studies children as he would study grasshoppers, 
scientifically analyzing, introspecting, hunting reflexes, 
but who never ministers to them at feeding and neck- 
washing time, or hears them say their little prayers, or 
catches them lying to him innocently, clumsily, scien- 
tifically, according to the degree of preparedness. What 
mother, even of the brute creation, would not know 
better than to test the effect of fear on a young child 
by holding her baby out of a second-story window, as 
did one of our psychologists? It is noteworthy that 
the experiment was a success, for the child died of 
fright. 
But to translate the word psychology by the phrase 
“knowledge of human nature” is to exalt the subject 
overmuch, for it deals with only a part of human
-P-A-G-E-15
  The Teacher-Mother’s Opportunity 7 
nature, the mind, while education is a battle for the 
soul of the child. In our public schools we assume that 
the pupil consists only of mind and body, made in 
the image and likeness of a grade model, souls being 
popularly ignored, probably because the schoolmen 
have not succeeded in reducing them to a common 
denominator. 
So much for modern psychology in its negative 
aspect. On the positive side matters are even worse, 
for the sound, sane teachings of earlier days have been 
so misconstrued, distorted, or altogether rejected, that 
we now have a body of literature that is ostensibly 
based on the study of childhood, yet fits no race of 
beings, at least human beings, that inhabit the earth 
at the present time. Its strange, wild theories seem to 
have originated from the process of imagining what 
children like best to do and writing these things out, 
averring them to be the science of exactly what ought 
to be done. “Find out what they want to do and then 
let them do it,” has taken the place of, “Find out what 
they can do and then make them do it.” 
Children do not like to work, therefore they should 
be taught through play. Children take an interest in 
things that interest them, therefore never require chil- 
dren to do anything that does not interest them, because 
if they are interested they will do it anyhow. Ameri- 
can children will not be coerced, they show their native 
independence by demanding their own way; therefore 
never say “Don’t” or “Must” to an American child. 
Divert him; if he bites or kicks his mother, she should 
offer him instead a ball to kick or a raisin to bite, 
explaining to him that mother will not love him if he 
bites or kicks. Does it require a pedagogue to under- 
 
-P-A-G-E-16
  8 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
stand that following his natural inclinations reduces 
man to the level of the brute? 
It is generally admitted that the right education of 
children is the most important business in the world, 
yet the word education has never even been satisfac- 
torily defined. All good parents, however, are agreed 
that they would like their children trained to be upright, 
faithful, prompt, precise, orderly, obedient, self-con- 
trolled; ready to acknowledge their mistakes, to respect 
the rights and property of their neighbor, to adapt 
themselves to actual conditions, to work without waste 
of time and effort. They would set a high valuation on 
reverence and humility. They would like to see labor 
and duty become the habit of life, setting so easily on 
the wearer that there is no newness nor harshness in 
physical exertion, mental effort, or moral obligation. 
Picture to yourself the man or woman imbued with 
these old-fashioned virtues and you visualize the say- 
ing: “There were giants in those days.” Who would 
be so rash as to apply the adjectives “ignorant,” “‘uned- 
ucated,” to one of these, even though he were un- 
schooled? Who would have the audacity to assert 
that schools ever gave or can give this homespun 
training? 
Now, if we add to the foregoing qualifications the 
instruction that opens the various gates of the mind, 
sharpens the desire for knowledge, and leads to the 
love of good books, it would scarcely be necessary to 
instruct the young learner even in the elements of 
reading or spelling or writing or arithmetic, so well- 
equipped is he to complete his education for himself 
and by his own efforts. Such a boy or girl is educated 
in the fullest, finest sense of the word, and such educa- 
   
-P-A-G-E-17
  The Teacher-Mother’s Opportunity 9 
tion and instruction can be carried on by any earnest, 
conscientious mother who is able to read this book. 
The gospels were not set beyond the understanding of 
the people of plain speech, and there is nothing in true 
teaching or sound method that cannot be stated in 
language equally plain and direct. 
To accomplish these things, the teacher-mother’s 
opportunities for self-cultivation need not have been 
abundant; indeed her book-instruction need not have 
taken her beyond the primary grades. A little learning 
judiciously used drives home more surely than does 
great learning which is unsupported by sympathetic 
understanding of the child’s needs. The mother need 
not be familiar with the customs and conventionalities 
of the fashionable world in order to make her children 
well-mannered and thoughtful of others. She need 
be neither artist nor scientist in order to awaken in 
her children a love of art and science. She need be 
neither grammarian nor logician in order to lay the 
foundations for her children’s mastery of English and 
logic. A whetstone will not cut the grass, but it will 
put an edge on the scythe that will cut the grass. 
The mother’s chief strength lies in her moral nature. 
Her very presence and example must exercise a con- 
stantly stimulating and elevating influence. Such a 
mother, even if no great aid to her children in the 
acquisition of school subjects, is the ideal mother. Give 
us such mothers, and our nation will indeed be the 
leading nation of the world. I wonder whether teacher- 
mothers fully realize the sublimity of this, their exalted 
destiny. 
Is there a single one among my readers who can 
rightly claim that her children are shut out by indi- 
 
-P-A-G-E-18
  10 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
gence, unfavorable location, or similar disadvantage 
from all that is for their spiritual, physical, and mental 
welfare? From the humblest homes go forth the 
heroes; from keeping his father’s sheep, David was 
called to rule over Israel. Often it is the “unconsidered 
trifles,” the things we overlook because they are so 
deadly commonplace, that play the most important part 
in early education. An artist who had completed a 
magnificent stained-glass window for a famous cathe- 
dral was chagrined to find that his apprentice had fash- 
ioned one still more beautiful from the shards rejected 
by his master. Child-training is an art, and the good 
mother is the greatest of earthly artists. In each well- 
ordered home her materials, her models, her inspiration 
are at hand, ready for use. Surely it was for her that 
Longfellow intended the lines: 
“That is best which lieth nearest ; 
Shape from that thy work of art.” 
Alfalfa is a difficult crop to establish, as it needs a 
special kind of fertilizer to enable the roots to draw 
their nourishment from the ground and air, but once 
it gets a start and finds itself at home in the new soil, 
it thrives and becomes not only a most valuable and 
abundant crop but also a permanent one, and moreover 
the soil becomes fourfold richer for its having grown 
therein. What this fertilizing principle does to alfalfa, 
faith and courage do for the mother. If she will take 
the lesson of this phenomenon to heart and instead of 
pleading lack of time, knowledge, patience, culture, 
energy, self-confidence, servants, experience, inventive- 
ness, just leave undone some of the things she now
-P-A-G-E-19
    
The Teacher-Mother’s Opportunity II 
thinks so important and take that time to teach her 
children, she will find that instead of being stupid, 
naughty, lazy, disobedient, or “nervous,” they are really 
very bright and sweet and lovable, and that her efforts 
in this direction bring their daily and hourly reward. 
This it is which makes so fascinating the work of 
the real educators, the parents—the realization that 
teaching young children is the most interesting of all 
intellectual pursuits, being one of the compensations for 
their many sacrifices. Some prefer gardening or lab- 
oratory experimentation or sailing unfamiliar seas, or 
the reading, writing, or translating of books, but in 
child-training are to be found united the bewitchments 
of all these occupations, the surprises of unlooked-for 
reactions, the glimpses of Utmost Isles, the frankness 
and freshness that your mere grown-up author strives 
vainly to regain. 
But if at times your patience in teaching your chil- 
dren should seem completely exhausted and the pros- 
pects of ultimate success none too bright, the thought 
of how really noble and indispensable your task is 
ought to brace you up. Many a great man is extolled 
in history’s pages whose deeds brought to mankind 
more unhappiness than good. Not to Alexander, nor 
Cesar, nor Napoleon could be attributed a service as 
great as to the home that sends into the world a family 
of well-trained children to fight and overcome evil,
-P-A-G-E-20
CHAPTER II 
EDUCATION OR HEREDITY 
Every normal child has a full set of faculties; in 
each are the same fundamental nature, the same reason 
and will, the same endowment for his destined work. 
This does not in the least mean a sameness or equality 
of mind or soul such as permits each to become a St. 
Francis or a Shakespeare, which would be no more 
possible than desirable. But it does mean that all 
normal human beings are in one way or another equally 
gifted for useful, honorable, and successful careers, 
whether the work for which they were called to earth 
be with head or hand, and that it is our most sacred 
duty to find out what each child can do and then to 
educate him accordingly. The child comes into the 
world with dormant possibilities for every conceivable 
degree of good and bad, without being himself either 
virtuous or vicious. Whether he is to become a mes- 
senger of light or of darkness depends very largely 
upon his environment—that is, his education, for every- 
thing that influences body, mind, or soul, becomes by 
that very fact an element in education. 
Mere brains are relatively common possessions, Na- 
ture being here as elsewhere often recklessly profuse. 
She does not grow discouraged, even though, as is 
likely, not one brain in ten millions is developed to its 
full capacity, but paradoxically and shrewdly enough, 
she is most lavish where she seems most niggardly, 
I2
-P-A-G-E-21
  
Education or Heredity 1 
most sparing where she seems most generous. In this 
seeming contradiction may be recognized the divine 
“equality of opportunity,” for as each has the advan- 
tage of his special gift, so he has the positive drawbacks 
of that advantage—and the advantages of what are 
carelessly regarded as drawbacks, a fact which is illus- 
trated in every schoolroom. In the case of the infant 
prodigy there is danger that the overdeveloped brain 
will cheat the body, that book-greediness will displace 
healthy interest in his fellow beings, practical affairs, 
and the world of living nature. He needs steady guid- 
ance and wise control to make him an educated man 
and not a mere unbalanced scholar. Conversely, the 
child of slow development, whose school career is a 
daily mortification of the spirit, because he is out- 
stripped and derided by his classmates, needs steadying 
encouragement to save him from falling a victim to 
the notion of foredoomed failure. Every psychologist 
knows that this child’s gifts may be of the slow- 
growing, long-lived, mighty kind, that thrive in a 
forest and wither in a flower-pot, and that he may be 
no more adjustable to the insignificant, brain-padding 
performances of the classroom than the elephant is to 
supremacy in cross-stitch. He naturally and properly 
leaves kindergarten stunts for little minds. 
Other schoolroom varieties are the child who memo- 
rizes with great readiness and therefore easily suc- 
cumbs to the fallacy that knowledge is education and 
that his way through life will consequently be smooth; 
the child with splendid physical endowments, who needs 
wise instruction and unremitting discipline to save him 
from contentment with mere animal frolicsomeness; 
and the child in whom only the unadorned, com-
-P-A-G-E-22
  14 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
mon-sense-heel-and-toe qualities are discernible, who, 
whether we like it or not, is harmed least by our school- 
men’s efforts to standardize the goose and the eagle. 
This last is least likely to mismanage his life. 
In every generation society is burdened with a vast 
army of derelicts whose number could undoubtedly 
have been appreciably reduced by education. The great 
majority of these unfortunates could have been trained 
into becoming safe and useful, even though not bril- 
liant, members of society. If their torrential energies 
had been safely directed, a few might well have become 
literary geniuses, pioneers of scientific investigation, 
or leaders of men. We have all met many backward, 
subnormal, atypical, or literally feeble-minded children, 
in whom the trouble could be traced to lack of early 
discipline. 
In a study of normal and retarded children recently 
made in public schools, the following explanations of 
certain retarded cases were given by the investigator: 
(1) Child has nose and throat trouble, hindering ad- 
vancement; (2) child is nervous and excitable; (3) 
child is allowed to go to moving pictures at night; 
(4) child is sneaking, sullen, and selfish. A compar- 
ison of the reports showed that the normal and success- 
ful pupils came from good homes and had parents who 
were actively interested in their progress at school and 
their education at home. 
It is usual and most convenient to speak of “mental 
defectives” as of poor human beings who are handi- 
capped from birth by an organic deficiency of brains, 
but many authorities on the subject do not so regard 
_ them, declaring that in many cases mental deficiency is 
due to parental neglect during the early formative 
*
-P-A-G-E-23
Education or Heredity 15 
period of the afflicted individual. Moreover, the indi- 
vidual’s value to the community cannot be standardized 
by intelligence alone, for the ability to acquire infor- 
mation and knowledge and to understand is only one 
of the qualities of the mind, although the most impor- 
tant single mental faculty, being partly inherited, and 
partly acquired through education, experience, and 
schooling. Still, considered by itself, it does not ren- 
der its possessor of any great worth to the community, 
but must be accompanied, supported, and controlled by 
certain humbler but intrinsic and normally cultivable 
characteristics. Lack of development of the will and 
the emotions results in a lack of balance that cannot 
be remedied by the individual’s capacity for acquiring 
and storing mere formal and worldly knowledge. For 
that matter, the merely intelligently groomed man who 
lacks moral or mental stability is wrong-minded, and 
should be regarded as a social menace and a fit object 
for segregation. 
On the other hand, it is a commonplace that there 
are many individuals who could not pass an ordinary 
intelligence test because of lack of vocabulary, slow- 
ness of comprehension, or poverty of information, who 
yet possess common sense, the shrewdness to learn 
through their own experience, and the working ability 
that enables them to be self-supporting. Discipline of 
one kind or another, either deliberate or involuntary, 
has drilled them in control of their emotions, the exer- 
cise of will power, stability, and trustworthiness, all 
of which combined have produced law-abiding citizens 
who are useful followers, subordinates, and helpers in

tion of mental defectives, whether there is a greater 
proportion of feeble-mindedness among the rich or 
the poor, and her reply was that they are in about the 
same proportion, but that owing to the difference in 
treatment, the rich seem to be the more heavily afflicted. 
“These unfortunate children,” she said, “are tended 
hand and foot. Though their only salvation is being 
made to help themselves, everything is done for them, 
so that their incapacity becomes more and more pro- 
nounced, while among the poor such unfortunates have 
the advantage of the discipline of circumstances. Being 
obliged to do things for themselves, their abnormal- 
ity becomes less and less, in reality as well as in 
appearance.” 
The fact that a child appears hopelessly dull or lack- 
ing in intelligence is all too often the pretext for par- 
ents neglecting his training. A child may have a 
discoverable handicap, like weak sight or hearing or 
an obstruction to breathing or some other physical 
difficulty, which retards advancement along accus- 
tomed lines, but it is too late to give the most essential 
training before any living expert can pronounce him 
irremediably defective or feeble-minded. Many chil- 
dren who appear mentally deficient are in reality highly 
gifted in ways that we fail to recognize or rightly ap- 
praise. We could list in this class many notable men 
and women who were considered impenetrably stupid 
or hopelessly backward, when subjected to school meas- 
urements wherein the examiners forgot, or more likely 
had never learned, that it takes longer to sprout an 
acorn than a pumpkin seed. 
Children who come into the world with underdevel- 
oped bodies are often cared for in such a way that they
-P-A-G-E-25
  Education or Heredity 17 
gain health and strength. It is certainly 4 reasonable 
argument that mental qualities, which in early child- 
hood are at best embryonic, should continue so for a 
longer or shorter time. A case of retarded develop- 
ment will become permanent unless special attention is 
paid to it. Just as the physically weak infant lacks the 
force to develop without special care and nurture, so 
the mentally weak lacks the force to develop without 
special care and training. 
It is, of course, more pleasurable to teach children 
who respond quickly and showily to our efforts, but 
they who labor patiently, intelligently, and persistently 
to awaken the soul and mind of the little slow-witted 
backward child will be rewarded in due season with an 
unfolding of that soul and intellect as marvelous as the 
blossoming of the fragrant water-lily out of the dull 
brown bud that grew up from the slime. 
But if, after judicious and long-continued training, 
we are forced to accept hopeless subnormality as a fact, 
we should submit to the conditions imposed and seek 
to develop whatever minor abilities the child does pos- 
sess, thus fitting him for a useful, busy, and therefore 
moderately happy life, even with limited intellectual 
resources. The parents may well find their solace in 
the indisputable argument that at the worst misfortune 
is relative and that unintelligence is less deplorable and 
dangerous than keenness of mind with badness of 
heart, for as Macaulay says, “Nine-tenths of the calami- 
ties which have befallen the human race have had no 
other origin than the union of high intelligence with 
low desires.” Let us accept as preferable the union of 
low intelligence with high desires. 
Here we recall a tale of the Middle Ages, about the
-P-A-G-E-26
  18  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
poor natural who sorrowed bitterly because he alone 
could find no way to adore his Lord. The monks who 
housed him could pray, or preach, or copy the Bible, 
or make the garden, but he, as fervent in his piety as 
the best of them, could do none of these things, nor 
could he even remember from day to day the shortest 
prayer. He could not learn to distinguish weed from 
pulse. Out of his yearnings came light: how to trans- 
late his one poor talent into prayer. When next the 
prior came into the church, he was astonished at sight 
of the poor simpleton turning somersaults before the 
high altar. “I can pray, I can pray,” was his joyful 
cry. And the wise monks did not interfere with his 
devotion. 
Contrast this with the picture of a high school senior 
in white flannels, upholding himself by a rustic gate 
one fine summer morning, exchanging chit-chat with 
a group of girls. Their father came out and said: “I 
see your grandmother over on the hillside hoeing her 
potatoes. Why don’t you do that for her and then 
come back and take supper with us?” The cub lifted 
his chin like the hero of a collar advertisement and 
drawled the deathless phrase: ‘Me hoe potatoes? No, 
never !”” 
Conscientious parents sometimes let sickly children 
run wild in the mistaken belief that strict discipline 
would hinder recovery. Now humoring children is as | 
destructive to the body as to the mind. A doctor who 
examined one thousand children from homes where 
there was but one child, and one thousand from homes 
with four or more children, found that of the former, 
eleven per cent and of the latter sixty-nine per cent 
were physically normal. The ills of the former were
-P-A-G-E-27
Education or Heredity 19 
chiefly due to pampering and generally took the form 
of “nervousness” and disturbances of the digestive 
tract. In the interdependence of mind and body, mind 
is the stronger element, and a well-ordered mind is not 
necessarily excluded from a feeble body, as can be 
proved by numerous examples in history, such as Julius 
Cesar, William of Orange, Frederick the Great, Pope, 
Scott, and many others. 
Criminals are not born, but made, and neither morals 
nor manners are hereditary. What appéars like evil 
inheritance is usually habit acquired through bad exam- 
ple or parental negligence at so early an age that it has 
all the outward signs of congenital depravity. We are 
never too young to learn. A mother apologizes for her 
seven-year-old’s tobacco-chewing by saying that he 
inherited the taste. When that child was two years 
old he would say: “See daddy,” stick his tongue into 
his cheek in imitation of his father’s quid, then trot 
to the door and vigorously expectorate. Another 
seven-year-old, who harnesses and drives the horses, is 
known as a born horseman. When he was scarcely a 
year old his father would take him on his knee when 
driving and let him hold the reins. From the time 
when he began to walk the child’s favorite ‘“make- 
believe” was to get hold of a rope, a strap, or his moth- 
er’s apron-strings and “drive horsey.” Does anyone 
believe that this boy would be a “born horseman” if he 
had never ridden on anything but a street-car? 
Parents cannot escape responsibility by blaming a 
child’s naughtiness on some ancestor, unless that ances- 
tor has lived recently enough to corrupt the child by 
living example. | Right and wrong are not matters of 
instinct, but have to be learned. Righteousness does
-P-A-G-E-28
  20 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
not come by nature any more than reading or writing. 
The blame for the boy who goes wrong rests largely 
with the parents who, through ignorance or negligence, 
have failed to train him aright during the habit-form- 
ing days of early childhood. 
Perhaps the foregoing free dissertation may be 
summed up in this wise: Fitness of the individual to 
hold his place in society depends only in a degree upon 
native intelligence. Where intelligence is counterbal- 
anced by lack of good moral fiber and of right habits, 
the result should properly be called feeble-mindedness, 
intelligence having then only a negligible value. Army 
examinations showed that many who tested “feeble- 
minded” were functioning normally in society; and 
that, on the other hand, many who ranked well in tests 
of educational capacity were valueless to the community 
because of temperamental unfitness. 
The causes of failure in life are nearly all more or 
less the outcome of a domestic system that failed the 
child during the early and most impressionable years, 
before schooling should begin. These causes are idle- 
ness, carelessness, impulsiveness, mental confusion, and 
inability to sustain attention, to prolong effort, to 
profit by past mistakes of self or others. These causes 
of failure are the result of habits formed and set before 
the age of seven. Forethought, prudence, readiness to 
meet an emergency are of no less value than capacity 
for learning. It is, therefore, a justifiable conclusion 
that lack of discipline leaves the individual lacking in 
those qualities without which intelligence is not only 
worthless but-& menaceand_that,-after—all, “brains” 
are not such a valuable possession as are temperamental 
balance, self-control, trustworthiness, purposiveness,
-P-A-G-E-29
  Education or Heredity 21 
and perseverance—characteristics which are primarily 
the resultants of early and regular training. As one of 
the main purposes of education is to fit the individual 
to adapt himself to circumstances and adjust himself 
to whatever station in life he may be called to occupy, 
it follows that from the earliest years he needs practice 
in doing these things. Otherwise when the call comes 
he will be like an awkward tyro, not drilled for the 
crucial test. The catastrophic violence of the eternal 
fight between the powers of darkness and of light, 
between despotic anarchy and well-ordered government, 
between Hell and Heaven, which we witness in our 
time, can be successfully met and counteracted by the 
mothers of our country, through the unfailing means 
of a good home education. Each orderly, well-disci- 
plined home is a bulwark against civic disorder. 
If you train your children carefully until they are 
seven years old, so that they quickly carry out your 
behests, instantly refrain from doing the forbidden 
thing, make no attempt to rebel, to question your 
authority, to demand your reasons for a command; do 
not whine, sulk, have tantrums; are helpful, respectful, 
loving, and thoughtful, you swill not need to worry 
about the future. Your children are already three- 
quarters educated, and you need only continue as you 
have begun. If in addition to these things you teach 
them to use their five senses and help them to acquire 
a vocabulary and general information in such simple, 
thorough ways as I shall point out, without a book i 
their hands, me ur children will be educated, even though 4 
they should nter a schoolroom, for they

  CHAPTER III 
PSYCHOLOGY AND PEDAGOGY 
THERE are five things, all more or less the outcome 
of a domestic system, which will determine whether 
or not your children are to be successful in school and 
life: 
(1) The habit of ready and prompt obedience. This 
habit is implanted and grows sturdily through daily 
lessons, which have for their main purpose the training 
of children to respond instantly, almost automatically, 
to their parents’ summons and commands. 
(2) Reverence towards God, which the child must 
learn through careful teaching, for it is not born with 
him. He must acquire a deep sense of humility and 
dependence upon the kind and loving Father of all, 
who is in Heaven. 
(3) The work-habit. Many children fail in school 
because their natural and lovely playfulness has been 
allowed to deteriorate into the play-habit. They have 
been taught only through “interest,” a convenient but 
dangerous substitute for endeavor. In our early child- 
hood we must learn to work and how to work, for in 
later life the world will not trouble to entertain us so 
that we may be coaxed into doing things. Habits of 
idle amusement mean failure in school and in life. 
(4) The habit of observation. The five senses must 
be trained by daily simple lessons at home. Even if all 
the teachers were willing and competent, this is a task 
22
-P-A-G-E-31
Psychology and Pedagogy 23 
which cannot be accomplished in the school, but only 
continued and supplemented there. Moreover, by the 
time a child is old enough to enter school he is past the 
age when some of the most important and fundamental 
parts of this training should have been given. 
(5) A good vocabulary. Many children fail in 
school because they do not know the meaning of indis- 
pensable words with which to express and create ideas, 
nor can they grasp the language of the textbooks. The 
home, which has the child during the most impression- 
able period of its life, can and should give this vocab- 
ulary. 
To accomplish its aim, education must be religious, 
moral, physical, mental. 
Religious. All education should be founded on a 
firm faith in and dutiful obedience to God. The child 
must learn and realize that everything with which he 
comes in touch is the work of an all-kind, all-wise, all- 
powerful Creator, Whose ways we cannot always un- 
derstand, but to Whom we can pray. 
Moral. When the child has got hold of this idea of 
its duty to God, it is easy to teach the difference between 
good and bad; to quicken the conscience; to make 
wickedness hateful. 
Physical. Education should show that the body is 
the temple of the immortal soul, to be kept strong, 
clean, and fit for the work the Creator designed it to do. 
Take account, then, of the influence that even correct- 
ness of bodily attitude has on the ‘whole mentality. 
Realize that the knowledge how to stand, sit, and 
. breathe properly is a part of mental as well as physical 
training. 
Mental. The mind has untold possibilities for good
-P-A-G-E-32
  24 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
or for evil, which will be developed partly by schooling, 
but mainly by religious, physical, and moral training. 
Far from being the most important part of education, 
schooling should be a secondary, though an essential 
consideration. 
Let us regard the first ten years of childhood as being 
divided into three periods, each of which requires its 
own method and its own kind of instruction. During 
the first three years the animal nature predominates. 
The child is learning mainly to direct and control his 
voluntary muscles, and teaching should strive towards 
making him form correct bodily habits, leading to 
increased self-control. Simple lessons, such as are out- 
lined in the chapters on Discipline, Play, and Observa- 
tion, should be given in order to prepare the unfolding 
senses for the next stage in normal development. 
From three to seven is a period of rapid physical 
growth. Next to the care of the awakening soul, 
muscle and nerve-training are our chief considerations. 
This is the most important time for gathering first- 
hand knowledge through the five senses, as well as for 
laying the religious foundation by establishing faith 
and trust in divine power and goodness. 
Between seven and ten comes the intellectual awaken- 
ing. From dealing with material realities, that is, with 
knowledge of things seen, heard, felt, tasted, smelt, the 
child proceeds to related ideas. From dealing with 
separate facts, he begins to realize connected facts. 
Where hitherto he has dealt only with things, he is 
now concerned about the reasons for things, and begins 
to reason from cause to effect, from effect to cause. 
In pedagogical language, he passes from the concrete 
to the abstract; from the particular to the general; 
a
-P-A-G-E-33
  
Psychology and Pedagogy 25 
from the known to the related unknown. Far from 
discontinuing the muscle training and sense training of 
the earlier periods, we should now supplement them 
with explicit mind training. We should give direct 
moral instruction, based on religious instruction. Dur- 
ing this period the child should learn to read. 
This classification by years is only relative and ap- 
proximate. We must consider mental as well as phys- 
ical age. Not merely reading about children, but a 
careful study of the individual child will guide the 
parents in determining for what instruction this par- 
ticular child is ready. Since no two children are in 
exactly the same sense beginners at the same age, it is 
not possible to start teaching two children of the same 
age in exactly the same way and meet with successful 
results. God made us one by one and to emphasize this 
individuality, He made no two exactly alike in body, 
mind, or spirit. 
The passion for standardization which has such an 
all-embracing influence in America, ranging from bath- 
tub stoppers and typewriter keyboards to the mind- 
processes of children, has been so far successful that 
the schools are nearly all graded, divided, and codérdi- 
nated on the same principles and in the same manner. 
The watchword is “quantity production and _inter- 
changeable parts.” One of the frightful possibilities 
suggested by schoolmen is that intelligence standards 
will soon do for education what standardized measure- 
ments have done in practical fields. Very possibly this 
end could be attained with the lower animals, for they 
exhibit a more simple and regulated constitution than 
ours, the lion, for instance, being invariably bold and 
ferocious, the lamb feeble and inoffensive, but God in
-P-A-G-E-34
  26  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
His wisdom has not seen fit to make human minds 
adaptable to this perfection of itemizing. This system 
of educational measurements is fundamentally weak- 
ened by the fact that the classifications depend upon the 
< child’s answers to questions, and these answers indi- 
‘ cate the kind of teaching he has had, not the kind or 
degree of intelligence he possesses. The fact that Mon- 
tessori trained idiot children so that they successfully 
passed the examinations drawn up for normal pupils 
substantiates this objection. The safe guide to the 
child’s intelligence and to the kind of lessons he is 
ready to learn, is not his answers but his questions. 
Testing a six-year-old girl’s intelligence according 
to the graded list of questions, a school principal asked 
her: “What would you do if a fire started in your 
house?”’? When she answered, “I do not know,” she 
was marked below standard intelligence, whereupon I 
asked the examiner what he would do if a fire started 
in his house, and found that he did not know either. 
Before determining his course of action he wanted to 
know the nature, extent, location, and disposition of 
the conflagration. In this book the age of three means 
the time when the child’s questions show that he is 
investigating his surroundings with interest other than 
that connected with feeding, walking, sleeping; when 
he wants to know the names of things and seems ready 
to learn. It is then time to teach him. 
One can recognize the child’s emergence from the 
second or kindergarten period into that third stage 
referred to as intellectual by his asking the reasons for 
things, such as, Why is the rose red? Why can’t I fly 
like the birds? The word what belongs to the second 
period, why to the third period. Let me say here to
-P-A-G-E-35
Psychology and Pedagogy 27 
the mothers, as I shall say again and again, that what- 
ever may be the temptation and whatever the incite- 
ments, do not undertake to hasten the transition from 
one stage to the next, for to do so is to thwart and 
defeat your own dearest hopes. Would you hasten 
incubation by cracking the shell before the chick was 
ready to make its way out? Just keep this homely 
maxim in mind: When you do not know whether to 
teach a thing or not, do not teach it. 
We need not discuss at length the training of the 
infant. Few mothers would confess their inability to 
learn how to care for and to train the babe, yet the 
first few years dominate his future and require the 
highest instinctive and acquired wisdom. For example, 
self-control.is said to be the triumph of education, yet 
the cornerstone of self-control is regularity inthe hours 
of feeding and sleeping. The main thing we need to 
insist upon for the child of two or thereabouts is that 
he should be a healthy little animal, trained to obey and 
be docile. Discipline, play, or occupation, and the phy- 
sician’s instructions, all administered with good sense, 
constitute the safe curriculum for the first three years. 
Next comes the home kindergarten period, which 
usually determines whether the child is to become a use- 
ful citizen or a loafer. He is learning in every waking 
moment, indeed he almost seems to learn while he 
sleeps. He is becoming conscious of his surroundings 
and is dealing with concrete experiences. At this time 
correct physical habits should be well established and 
correct mental habits developed. The age between three 
and seven is more important educationally than the 
entire school course. There is a more striking differ- 
ence between children at this age than at any subse- 
 
-P-A-G-E-36
  28  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
quent time, and watchful care and regular instruction 
are more important now than they will ever be again. 
Ignorance or neglect on the part of parents leave inef- 
faceable scars, yet this is the period which is more 
neglected than any other. Let mothers ask themselves, 
Why? 
To begin with, sense training is a necessary part of 
the foundation on which to build a strong mentality, 
for with proper training of the senses at the time of 
their natural unfolding, it would be possible to increase 
fourfold the mental power of the generation so taught. 
Indeed, if it were possible to enforce such a law, the 
state should make sense training compulsory at home 
and in school. The attention of the beginner is turned 
particularly towards external objects. The little child 
is “all eyes and ears.” This is a manifestation of 
Nature’s way of taking the first steps in the child’s 
education, since it is through this inquisitiveness that 
he becomes acquainted with the outside world. The 
gates of the mind are opening. At the age of three 
and earlier the five senses should receive proper and 
adequate attention, and this training should continue 
until physical growth is attained; otherwise there will 
be a lack that cannot be supplied in adult life. 
During this period language should be established. 
The child should learn to enunciate distinctly and cor- 
rectly all the vowel and consonant sounds. He should 
learn the names of common things, their perceptible 
qualities, and their observable uses. Lessons should 
deal mainly with single objects, the mind not being 
ready for relationships. The rising of steam and the 
falling of raindrops are two separate lessons and the 
child of this age is not ready to connect steam or vapor
-P-A-G-E-37
  Psychology and Pedagogy 29 
with rain. He does not want reasons for things, for 
as yet he reasons only in the most limited way. Neither 
does he want generalities. He must learn the same 
thing about a great many separate things before he can 
combine this knowledge into generalities. 
When Esther brings in a weed, teach her from it 
the different parts—root, leaf, etc., and its name, and 
note whether it is in flower or bearing seed. When 
next day she brings in another weed, go over the same 
lessons without comment. By and by, maybe a year 
or three years hence, the child will realize that all the 
plants she found had root, stalk, leaf, flower, seed, and 
she will have made one of the great discoveries of her 
life, an abstraction. But do not hasten this process. 
Let her arrive at this conclusion herself. In this simple 
way you lay the foundations for accurate human rea- 
soning. Proceeding thus, in various directions, and 
little by little, she will learn the fundamental laws of 
Nature and comprehend the great fundamental truths 
of the Book of Genesis. 
Together with training in observation and language, 
should come training in obedience, self-control, and 
industry. The very best means of instilling these les- 
sons is through little tasks about the house, carefully 
chosen to fit the child’s age and strength, which he 
should be trained to perform regularly and punctually. 
“Helping mother” is the most profitable kind of train- ¥ 
ing. The kindergarten period is the mother’s great 
opportunity. The home permits full individual devel- 
opment, the necessity for which will be readily under- 
stood. Every faculty has its proper period of develop- 
ment as well as its peculiar mode of growth; hence the 
education belonging to a certain period must be given
-P-A-G-E-38
  30 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
at that period, else there is an impediment or a defect 
that will be a life-handicap. 
During this wonderful early epoch the instruction 
should be personal, and so planned as tenderly to guard 
the unfolding mind, as well as at times to let it unfold 
by itself. The importance of this “letting alone” is 
best told by the poet Lowell: 
“They knew not how he learned at all, 
For idly, hour by hour, 
He sat and watched the dead leaves fall, 
Or mused upon a common flower. 
“Tt seemed the loveliness of things 
Did teach him all their use, 
For, in mere weeds, and stones, and springs, 
He found a healing power profuse. 
“Yet after he was dead and gone, 
And e’en his memory dim, 
Earth seemed more sweet to live upon, 
More full of love, because of him.” 
Let the mother go again and again to Nature for 
stimulus, suggestion, encouragement, correction. The 
question, “Little flower, what can you teach me?” will 
not go unanswered. Still more fully will the forest 
answer her questioning. This is not empty phrasing, 
for the child develops as the tree develops, the definite 
order of growth being controlled in each instance by a 
great natural law. At my feet lies a large spruce, 
showing a cross-section fresh from the ax, and in the 
exact center of the circumference is a dark spot about 
as large as the pupil of the human eye. Surrounding
-P-A-G-E-39
  
Psychology and Pedagogy 31 
this is a distinct circle, one half-inch across, which 
marks the growth attained by the sapling in the first 
year. Outside of this is a second concentric circle, one 
inch across, showing the second year’s growth. There 
are fifty of these circles, telling the finished history of 
that tree as plainly as could the typesetter. Date of 
birth, the good growing seasons, the cold and backward 
suummer—each has its chapter. The tree adjusted itself 
to circumstances and made, on the whole, a normal 
growth; a little more this year, a little less the next. 
A half-century of rain and sun, storm and calm work- 
ing together, had fulfilled the law. 
Beside my spruce lies another spruce. It, too, started 
life in 1871, with everything needful bound up in that 
little center like the pupil of the eye, but here, instead 
of symmetry, is one-sidedness. The heart of the tree 
is far from the center, the bounding lines of annual 
growth are irregular, the first ten years’ increase on 
the north side being equal to only one year’s increase 
on the south side. Because of the lack in one part, the 
tree is defective in every part. The soul, the mind, 
the body, do not grow separately, and attempts to make 
them do so must end disastrously. When the higher 
faculties remain undeveloped, man falls lower in the 
scale of creation than the brute beasts of the field, 
whereas mind developed at the expense of the body will 
be weighted to the earth instead of being nourished 
by it. 
Here are a few reminders for the teacher-mother : 
Be forehanded. Plan a day ahead. Do not try to 
live more than one day at a time. From sunrise to 
sunrise is the perfect circle. Make that day as com- 
plete as you can. Glance over the day’s record at
-P-A-G-E-40
  32  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
nightfall, take stock of blunders and omissions, and 
during the coming day set them as nearly right as you 
can. Do not fret lest you may not accomplish this or 
that in a year or ina season. “Continue adding a little 
to what was originally a little, and you will form a 
great heap.” 
Do not look for great and immediate showy results. 
You know that you must give a seed time to sprout, and 
a plant time to form sound roots, and you would not 
dig it up now and then to see how it is coming along. 
Therefore do not ask the child to give forth informa- 
tion or to produce results, and do not be disappointed 
if something is completely forgotten which you thought 
you had taught for all time. 
Never get impatient because the child learns slowly. 
Bee-keepers will tell you that new honey sometimes 
has a rank, disagreeable taste and odor unless left in 
the hive to ripen after the bees have sealed it over. So 
long as your children are obeying willingly, are learning 
to be polite, thoughtful of others, self-controlled, help- 
ful, to make and do things with their hands, to observe, 
learning new words through these and other lessons, 
do not worry nor try to hurry them. 
Make things simple rather than easy for children, 
who as a rule are not afraid of “hard” things. Find 
out what the child can do and then make him do it. 
The right kind of teaching and learning involves effort 
but not distress. The environment must not be too 
evenly tempered. 
Do not attach value to secondhand knowledge of 
facts, or crowd the mind with information, even the 
best of information, any more than you would crowd 
the stomach with food. There is far more danger in
-P-A-G-E-41
Psychology and Pedagogy 33 
teaching too much than too little. The temptation to 
stuff a child with disconnected odds and ends of infor- 
mation, to show how much he can hold, is almost too 
much for the most experienced of us. Now the brain 
cannot constantly grasp a succession of facts, and to 
cram it beyond its capacity for assimilation is merely 
unculture. It is like sowing four bushels of wheat 
where two are required—there will be no yield. Not 
the knowledge a man has, but what he can do with it, 
is the test of his education; not how much the mother 
knows, but whether she can make the child do the work 
that is good for him, is the test of her fitness to teach. 
There is far less danger of overcrowding from a good 
mother, who is busy with her family, requiring a nor- 
mal amount of help from each, than from a mother 
who has less to do or where, unfortunately, the child 
is left to a nurse or governess or kindergarten. 
Continuing to apply to education the terms of for- 
estry, let us remember that the good forester has an 
eye to the direction and shape which the young tree 
should take. He uses prop and pruning-knife where 
needed, trusts much to soil and rain and sunshine, 
bears in mind that sturdy trees demand time and room 
to grow, and does not try to grow oaks in flower-pots. 
Method is merely a way to an end, and the good teacher 
uses the plain and simple methods, acquired by observ- 
ing the operations of Nature and by her knowledge of 
human nature. Preconceived notions of education do 
not fit when it comes to dealing with the individual 
child. How often does one hear the wife of a school- 
man say: “Since we have had children of our own, my 
husband has entirely revised his ideas of education.” 
The teacher must follow the lead of the child, teaching 
 
-P-A-G-E-42

him what he is ready to learn as shown by his questions. 
The earlier good instructions are given, the more 
lasting will be their impression. Let goodness, not 
greatness, be the teacher-mother’s-goal. “Be good, my 
child, and let who will be clever.” Let who will do the 
dreaming of future greatness—do you stick to the plain 
old-fashioned doctrine of bringing up a child to be 
industrious, respectful, observant. How to do this 
cannot be told in a day, nor can it be attained in a sea- 
son nor ina year. It means line upon line, precept upon 
precept. “No day without a line,” was the motto cred- 
ited by the Elder Pliny to the great Greek painter 
Apelles.

CHAPTER IV 
DISCIPLINE 
WHEREVER and whenever human beings have been 
living and toiling together, a set of rules and measures 
to ensure peace, progress, and prosperity has been found 
necessary. (Stern necessity engenders and develops dis- 
cipline. Many mothers regard and use discipline as 
punishment, but according to Webster, it means the 
treatment suited to a disciple or learner; education; 
development of the faculties by instruction and exer- 
cise; training, whether physical, mental, or moral. 
Discipline originally meant a training or educating to 
obedience, the submission of the natural animal will 
to a law which is the expression of a human will. It 
meant control, with the definite purpose of establishing 
a reasoning self-control. Teacher-mothers must bear 
in mind that when I speak of discipline I adhere to this 
original and humane meaning. Military discipline, a 
term so often misused and misunderstood, is a totally 
different thing and quite out of place in child-training. 
Education, therefore, implies discipline. / Discipline x 
is the root and stem of collective and individual good; 
without it we cannot have system, and without system 
there can be no real progress: no school could effec- 
tively instruct; no great business undertakings could be 
carried on; democracy could not survive. Good parents 
facilitate life for their children by giving them the 
kind of training that makes an orderly mind and body 
35 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  
36 = Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
and trains every fiber to respond to rightful commands. 
It is a good thing to learn when young that life sets 
before us a certain number of things to be done, from 
which there is no escape. The children have to face a 
stern world in which duty will not be made pleasant for 
them. Day after day they will have to do the things 
that have to be done, not because it is nice to do them, 
but because they have to, or go down as failures. 
day of childhood should be a preparatory drill for this 
great battle of life. It is not enough that children are 
well-disposed, affectionate, obliging, but it is extremely 
necessary that they have regular practice in doing as 
they are told, without stopping to consider whether it 
suits their convenience. It takes a long, long time to 
learn to respond to a command with mind and body. 
Now discipline must be based on a knowledge of 
human nature, so take time for child study. Watch 
the growth of the human plant. Sometimes it will 
unfold leaf by leaf with pleasing symmetry, and if it 
should dismay us by a seemingly long period of dor- 
mancy, it is sure to burst out again into ravishing 
bloom. Books on the subject help us sometimes, but 
by suggestions rather than by information. 
Take time also for parent study. A good child is 
far more a matter of parent training than of child 
training, for what we would have children become, it 
behooves us to be, in mind and deed. An old philoso- 
pher reminds us that “not the cry but the rising of the 
wild drake impels the flock to follow him in upward 
flight.” In like manner good words without the exam- 
ple carry little weight with children, who are the keen- 
est, sharpest-witted, longest-memoried, most unsparing, 
and most honest of critics. Therefore ask yourself    
 
-P-A-G-E-45
  Discipline 37 
three times a day! Do I practice what I preach? Do I 
chastise the children for mirroring my shortcomings? 
Is my policy one of “Do as I say, not as I do?” AmI 
dispensing rewards and inflicting punishment according 
to mood or inclination or expedient, rather than accord- 
ing to justice? 
‘Begin early! A normal, healthy baby is disciplin- 
able; but parental neglect may make it undisciplinable 
and spoil it, and an undisciplined child is not likely to 
become a desirable citizen. Therefore, at seed-time, 
when you can still protect and train the tender sapling, 
begin to cultivate your child’s character. Will-power 
follows self-control, which depends primarily on phys- 
ical care and habit. An infant is not well reared if it 
has not some measure of self-control before it can 
speak. We cannot begin too early to teach the meaning 
and force of authority, and until the child has learned 
to do promptly and willy-nilly the thing that has to be 
done, its education cannot progress. 
Much of the trouble and worry over fhildren is 
really due to faulty domestic arrangements. (om regu- | 
larity is the keynote of success, therefore be method- ’ 
ical.) Systematize your household plans. Draw up a 
regular daily schedule, and not only keep to it but make 
your children do so as well, so that all day long they 
know “what comes next,” whether mealtime, bedtime, 
playtime, playing with baby, or helping mother in some 
other way. This does away with a certain amount of 
questioning and eventual protesting, which are excus- 
able in a child if regularity is not observed. 
Be just! Do not, in the fear of alienating the child’s 
love, condone faults and withhold punishment, for 
when kindly, strict discipline does not kill love. Chil- 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  38  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
dren worship justice, and even when it entails pain 
and inconvenience to themselves, they demand an eye 
for an eye. They may protest against deserved pun- 
ishment, yet they lose respect—nay, even feel contempt 
—for the parent or teacher who weakly yields. He 
who rules children firmly and justly gains not only their 
respect but their lasting affection, while those who seek 
favor by truckling usually overreach themselves. How 
often children are heard to say: “I do not like the new 
teacher ; she lets us do as we please,” or, a still worse 
indictment: “She pretended we knew our lessons when 
we didn’t.” Punishment for neglect or refusal to obey 
is what shows that commands are to be obeyed, there- 
fore the good mother enforces hers by a spanking if 
necessary. 
Be consistent! Correct a fault not only the first 
time but every time it appears. It is not the severity 
of punishment but its certainty that deters. First 
faults are most to be guarded against. A mere pecca- 
dillo, overlooked or condoned the first time, will soon 
grow into a habitual fault and then become a bad habit, 
whose correction will entail many and severe punish- 
ments. Indulgence on one occasion makes correction 
the next time unjust and doubly hard to bear, and, 
therefore, less effective. If the same fault is again 
repeated and again condoned, the child naturally won- 
ders, when punishment finally comes, why a thing 
should be wrong one day and not so another. More- 
over, curiosity and the inherent love of gambling will 
often lead a child to trespass, in the desire to find out 
“what will happen next time.” 
Be honest! Do not close your eyes to the child’s 
defects, or call naughtiness “nervousness” and bad

Discipline 39 
temper “sensitiveness.” How many mothers insist 
that theirs is an exceptional child, easily governed with 
a word, with love, with reasoning, but unable to endure. 
a command, and that any attempt to enforce obedience 
upsets his central nervous system! 
Do not treat the child like a plaything! Parents 
sometimes say: “I want my children to have things 
easier than I had them. My parents were too strict.” 
It is a fact, however, that the happiest homes are those 
in which helpfulness, promptness, and courtesy are 
required of each member, and where there is no escape 
from individual responsibility. We decry the harsh 
discipline of earlier days, yet if you would picture to 
yourself the most miserable child, think of one accus- 
tomed to having his own way. He it is who will hate 
and despise his mistaken parents. Happiness is, indeed, 
a vital consideration, but let us insure happiness of 
the true and lasting kind. In a world of resistance 
nothing but unhappiness confronts those who enter it 
unschooled to resistance, unused to self-denial, incapa- 
ble of self-control. 
Take care that the household does not fall into the 
habit of revolving about the child, who should be made 
to conform and adapt himself to the convenience of 
others. Do not let him grow up with the notion that 
the world revolves around any individual. The indi- 
vidual should seek his happiness in the good and hap- 
piness of the whole. Teach children to take a becoming 
back seat. Do not countenance a single demand for 
attention to their wants. It may be that those little 
sacrifices of self that you now oblige them to make will 
work out their salvation at a future time. Self-denial 
must be practiced early or never.
-P-A-G-E-48

Make the child do regular work. The having to do 
a set thing at a set time every day strengthens the char- 
acter of a child and gives it a certain determination in 
its whole bearing. In this way you bring order into 
life, body, and mind. There must be a certain amount 
of hard, serious work connected with education, and 
the earlier this is accomplished before the age of twelve, 
the more easily will new orderly habits be established. 
At about twelve, the character begins to form, and 
although the child may be as far as ever from being 
able to form correct judgments, it becomes increasingly 
difficult to use compulsion. Unless he be well accus- 
tomed to them, regular tasks are then drudgery. Of 
course discretion must be used by the teacher-mother, 
who must never become a taskmaster and slave driver. 
There must be “moderation in all things,” even in our 
noblest aspirations, but make the youngest child con- 
scious of his duty to save you steps, to conform to 
your plans, to take unobtrusively his turn at the daily 
grindstone. 
Give children a free hand except in those things 
injurious or detrimental to them, of which parents, not 
the children, are to judge. Let them make mistakes 
and suffer the consequences. Watch them at all times 
without their knowing they are watched. Let them 
play together without interference in their innocent 
mischievousness, or without knowing that your eye is 
upon them. 
Be sparing in your commands; never give any that 
are merely arbitrary, but make certain that the child 
understands and is perfectly able to carry out any that 
you give. Commands must be few and clear and neces- 
' sary, but see to it that the child carries them out. Be-
-P-A-G-E-49
  Discipline 41 
fore you speak, reassure yourself that he is quite able 
to carry out the order. Your word will then carry 
weight. Make a habit of quietly telling him what to 
do, and tolerate no appeals from your decision. Quiet 
submission to authority strengthens character, there- 
fore accustom the child to take a plain “no” with cheer- 
ful resignation. Give him what is good for him to 
have, not what he fancies, but do not talk about it. A 
simple “No” is far more effective than any kind of 
explanation, and at the same time more acceptable to 
the child. You need not emphasize it; it is emphatic 
in itself and readily so received. 
The merest baby wants her own way, and to a certain 
extent she is getting it when she perceives that she 
annoys you and disturbs your calm. She may not get 
the particular thing she is demanding, and you may 
enforce a rule she is endeavoring to evade, but if she 
has forced you to talk much about it, or to appear 
nervous or worried, she has attained a very considerable 
end, namely, made herself the evident center of gravi- 
tation. 
Often the whole question of discipline rests upon 
the form in which the command is given, that is, 
whether it sounds to the child like a supplication or an 
order. If you simply and naturally tell her what to do, 
the child will settle down to be happier, more cheerful, 
less disposed to the obnoxious American malady, 
“nerves.” 
Individual discipline, the habit of obedience, should 
be established long before collective discipline is at- 
tempted, or we do violence to human nature. A fine 
orchestra conveys to the unthinking an impression of 
concerted training only, yet before ever the master
-P-A-G-E-50
  42  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
attempted concert movements he taught and drilled the 
players one by one. Children need control; they need 
to feel a strong will directing, restraining, confining, 
limiting, and steadying them, for only in this way can 
they acquire real strength of will and character as 
opposed to stubbornness, wrong-headedness, and the 
lowest degree of desire. Disobedience is too often con- 
doned on the ground that the children must develop 
their “individuality,” or their “initiative,” parental lax- 
ity being excused on the plea that correction or suppres- 
sion makes children weak-spirited. The very mention 
of corporal punishment causes our self-styled educators 
to wring their hands in horror at the injustice and 
cruelty of laying hands on a little child. 
Now there can be neither safety nor happiness for 
a child unless it be based on willing submission to 
parental authority, which brings to the child self-con- 
trol and teaches it to bow the head to wisdom. In 
this and in no other way will it learn to kiss the rod 
that God holds out to us all. The child who has been 
taught to obey is already half-educated. Well-disci- 
plined children are not weak-spirited, sullen, or tyran- 
nical, and parental laxity is not love but hate. The 
fear of disobeying his parents is the first step in teach- 
ing a child to fear breaking the laws of the land and 
the laws of God. The habit of obedience can be estab- 
lished without resort to harshness, although not with- 
out punishment, but if not established in early child- 
hood it is doubtful whether it can be done without the 
harshest kind of harshness. 
A child must neither question nor criticize the man- 
dates of his parents. You need not fear being too 
stern in this respect, for if you give a child an inch he
-P-A-G-E-51
Discipline 43 
takes an ell. When you allow such a criticism to go 
unchecked, the child promptly assumes that he is en- 
tirely within his rights in pointing out the error of 
your ways, and will constantly seek for blunders of 
yours to point out. Yet nothing of this kind comes 
suddenly ; we are only forced to see suddenly something 
to which we have blinded ourselves. Make the children 
feel that they are only little children, and for this very 
reason must not undertake to tell any grown person 
what to do. They must not pass judgment on what is 
given them to do, or be allowed to discuss what is good 
and bad. They can know nothing about it, and yet 
through inadvertent talk they get the notion that they 
do know. The fewer words you use in giving a com- 
mand, the better. “Because mother tells you to,” is 
plain, simple, kind, and all-sufficient for a reason. The 
children will be more contented ; you will be happier and 
will be warding off the danger of that period which 
may otherwise arrive all too soon, when your boy gets 
the bit between his own little teeth and tells you that 
he does not agree with your point of view. 
There is not a day to waste in the matter of check- 
ing a disposition to question parental authority or 
judgment, or to seek a convincing presentation of the 
case before obeying a command. These faults never 
wear away of their own accord. Picture to yourself 
the difficulties and humiliations that confront the 
mother of a twelve-year-old who is not halter-broken. 
Personally, I do not believe that a boy who is normal 
and healthy and worth bringing up can be properly 
trained without the use of a good switch. 
The minute you let a child feel that he has a choice 
in the matter of obedience, all the Old Nick in him  
-P-A-G-E-52
    44 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
seems to be stirred up and the natural thing is for 
him to say, “I won't.” It is painful to me to watch 
a certain three-year-old child who is under my observa- 
tion but not my authority. His mother will say: 
“Doesn’t Jimmy want this?’ Jimmy does not. It 
may be the bread that he should eat with his dinner. 
“But it is good for Jimmy. Jimmy will be hungry 
before supper if he doesn’t eat this.’ Supper is far 
distant, and Jimmy is not impressed. “Jimmy won’t 
grow into a big man if he doesn’t eat what mother gives 
him.” Manhood is still farther off than supper, so 
Jimmy is still less impressed. After so many object 
lessons in how to get his own way, the child will 
naturally resist when later it becomes necessary to use 
compulsion. 
And he does resist. One day Jimmy decided to 
crawl under the fence into the pasture to look for the 
spotted calf. Father and mother explained that an 
ill-tempered bull held sway there, but to no purpose. 
The bull was not in sight, so each time the father 
released him Jimmy made for the fence. At last, in 
order to save the child’s life, the father beat him and 
beat him brutally, not once but again and again, yet 
instead of submitting, the child would race for the 
fence each time he escaped the father’s grasp, scream- 
ing out his defiance. While the performance was 
going on the bull came into view, pawing the earth 
and adding his hoarse bellow to the uproar. Only 
then, when thoroughly frightened, did the boy desist 
from his struggles, having in reality conquered his 
parents on this as on all previous occasions. Such was 
the sickening culmination of three years’ effort on the 
part of scholarly, “progressive” parents to rear an
-P-A-G-E-53
  Discipline 45 
active boy on the soul-destroying principle of “Never 
say don’t to a child; never say must to a child; never, 
oh, never, spank a helpless child.” 
The father should take a hand in the disciplining 
of boys, which should not be left entirely to the mother. 
It is pitiable but true that an intelligent boy very early 
learns to be a bit cynical about a woman’s discernment. 
The mother is naturally soft-hearted; her very makeup 
increases the difficulty of her being effectively strict 
and just, but no matter how intelligent, earnest, capa- 
ble, and strong-willed she may be, the boy will never 
have the same regard for her wisdom and authority 
as for the father’s. It is the same with women teach- 
ers. Every boy, from the age of ten onward, should 
be taught by men, but there is little use in discussing 
men teachers at a time when real men look askance 
at the profession because they do not fancy the task 
of Sisyphus. 
Unfortunately, a good many fathers leave the work 
of bringing up the boys entirely to the mother, because, 
as they say, they do not like to be bothered when they 
come home tired from business. Therefore, their most 
important duty is shelved, naughtiness is hidden or 
glossed over, and soon the lad is beyond all control 
and bounds. It is very nice on the mother’s part not 
to bother the father about the children’s doings during 
the day, but, after all, he should be cognizant of that 
which is going to have such a potent influence on the 
children’s future good. No sacrifice is too great when 
this is considered. How fortunate is the boy who 
grows up under his father’s vigilant eye! 
Should obedience be required only when the child 
understands why a command is given? No. This is
-P-A-G-E-54
  46 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
_ contrary to the laws of mind-growth. Obedience is an 
acquired habit and should be fairly established long 
before the mind is ready for explanations connecting 
facts. Mere exhortations to be good and obedient are 
ineffective. You cannot produce understanding by 
words alone. The child needs the support of authority. 
Authority, the cause, and obedience, the effect, demon- 
strate the law and principle of causality in all our 
doings, our happiness, our sufferings. Docility and 
willing recognition of authority are the substructure 
of successful learning. If his pupils lack these, the 
best teacher will fail. 
Many an intelligent child, although willing and 
eager to learn, fails in school because he has not been 
taught to do exactly as he is told. He may be quite 
willing to do the thing as far as the mind is concerned, 
but if the body be undisciplined it will obstruct the best 
intentions. Unconsciously he resists instruction. Good 
intentions, according to Dante, are the paving stones 
on the way to Hell. Training compels the sluggish 
and resisting body to answer the rulings of the willing 
spirit. 
A child can understand explanations and draw con- 
clusions concerning only those things which come 
within the scope of experience, which is a compara- 
tively limited area, but it cannot reason about all the 
facts within this area. Reasoning power is the result- 
ant of experience and training, and calls for the ability 
to measure and connect facts, to estimate and compare 
values, and to draw conclusions. How, then, can a 
child reason soundly when, to begin with, it is uncon- 
scious of facts? In the infant's world everything is 
magnified and exaggerated. Tables are higher than 
 
-P-A-G-E-55
  Discipline 47 
its head; days are longer than years will be later on; 
grown-ups are a separate race and twenty is hopelessly 
old; deeds are good or bad according to the effect pro- 
duced; wrong consists in being found out. The child 
has its own way of understanding, for which we can- 
not successfully substitute our own. “Teddy, did you 
throw that poor kitten into the cistern?’ Teddy 
looks up with a speculative eye. “Aunt Sally, (if) 
you saw me done it, me done it; (if) you didn’t see 
me done it, me didn’t.” 
It is a serious thing to put upon a young child the 
responsibility of making decisions, which is a burden 
for a grown person, and which often results in down- 
right illness! Yet a little child is put to it to make 
twenty decisions a day. Shall he do this, or that? 
And when he has finally decided, it is not after all 
what he wanted, and he must have twenty more strug- 
gles to get his own way about it. A child is never 
so happy and contented as when he finds himself 
relieved from the necessity of deciding whether or not 
he will obey, by having it decided for him, even through 
the instrumentality of a switch or birch. This ex- 
plains why a delicate child is often set on the road to 
health through the setting up of the simple process of 
rigid discipline. 
The majority of children are intelligent. They even 
have a healthy recognition of their own immaturity 
and lack of understanding. “T do not know; I am only 
a little girl.” But this intelligence, valuable as it is, 
must not be mistaken for the ability to reason soundly 
about right and wrong, truth and duty. The little 
child knows right from wrong only by the way his 
elders judge of it; the parents’ examples and precepts
-P-A-G-E-56
48  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
are his guide. “When I was a child, I thought as a 
child,” and this is as it should be. Children should not 
be treated as grown people, for it is unfair as well as 
foolish to place an old head on young shoulders. Were 
we indeed able to substitute our words for individual 
experience, we would circumvent a kindly Providence 
in thus letting the child grow old by leaps and bounds. 
Autumn fruits do not belong to the springtime, and 
even when the child is physically strong, we should not 
expect of him skill or tasks beyond his years. 
“But when the same ends can be attained by per- 
suasion,’ someone asks, “why insist upon old-fash- 
ioned submission to authority?” The same ends can- 
not be attained by persuasion. Persuasion is often 
deceptively effective for the moment, but when it fails, 
it fails disastrously. The child obeys because his intel- 
ligence shows him that obedience is advantageous, and 
he pretends to be convinced when he has only been out- 
talked. With each passing year a little more explana- 
tion and persuasion become a necessary preface to each 
request. Even at twelve or sixteen a child cannot 
fully understand why a certain companionship or 
recreation is forbidden; yet for the safety of soul 
and body he must submit to parental authority and be 
content to do so. Wordy explanations confuse even 
adults, and the child grasps only one tenth of our 
exhortations and distorts even that, drawing conclu- 
sions which are all too often the reverse of what we 
intend. One little girl wept before the painting of 
the Christian martyrs, because “one poor little lion 
didn’t have any martyr.” A teacher felt flattered by 
a young culprit’s breathless attention to her prolonged 
plea for reform, until at the first pause she was asked: 
 
-P-A-G-E-57
  Discipline 49 
“Say, when you talk, is it your upper or your lower 
jaw that moves?” 
So much for reasoning things out with children. 
Naturally, one should not give a command without 
having a reason therefore, but to have a reason and to 
obtain compliance from one’s child through explana- 
tions, are two very different things. ‘Because mother 
knows best,” should settle the matter. To rely upon 
the child’s judgment to choose obedience is dangerous, 
for if, after all your reasoning, the child’s opposition 
is not overcome, nothing is left but to assert your 
authority. How much better that authority should 
be taken for granted! 
The old-fashioned method of treating disobedience 
with a spanking or a switching has undoubtedly a cer- 
tain aspect of brutality, but if you want to view it in 
that light every single example of punishment has in 
it something unjust. The thing to do is to weigh 
such objections against the outcome of failure to pun- 
ish adequately and effectively. For Jimmy, that meant 
being gored by the bull, and prisons and madhouses 
are often the destination of the poor wretches whose 
parents thought spanking brutal. 
Perhaps my reader is one of the countless mothers 
who are eating their hearts out in trying to train an 
unruly boy without resort to the rod. You may as 
well give up. It can be done with witless, inactive, and 
sluggish children, but not with children who are alive 
from head to toe. For delinquencies between the ages 
of two and four, use a small birch switch or a limber 
corset steel. Attempts at “reasoning” are not only 
futile; they tend to make the child nervous and de- 
pressed, whereas as a curative and preventive a switch-
-P-A-G-E-58
50 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
ing is instantly effective, for it excludes the probability 
of tantrums that follow in the wake of solitary punish- 
ment, scolding, sitting on a chair, and such enfeebling 
makeshifts. It is the best remedy for ‘‘No, I won't.” 
The physical sting is a counter-irritant for naughti- 
ness and leaves the child wonderfully sweetened, docile, 
and serene. ‘ 
Tying in a chair, shutting up in a dark room, and 
such irritating teasings are much more likely to breed 
resentment than is a smart little switching or spanking, 
which the child understands perfectly, and which is a 
help to memory as much as a punishment. No one 
likes to inflict pain on a child, but a judicious switch- 
ing causes no real pain, though to produce a lasting 
impression it must momentarily sting or smart. How 
often have children of six or thereabouts confided to 
their chums that they would rather have a spanking 
than be scolded all the time, often adding that a spank- 
ing is over in a minute, but you don’t forget it. 
An objection to any form of prolonged or cruelly 
elongated punishment is that it almost amounts to try- 
ing titles for strength or endurance with the child. 
Some parents will tie up a child to the table-leg, stipu- 
lating that it must stay there until it is sorry, or until 
it is sure it will not forget, etc. The child feels and 
acts defiant. It screams and fights and plans what it 
will do when it is old enough to retaliate, whereas a‘ 
switching, thoroughly administered, humbles the child 
to a proper state of docility without leaving rancor. I 
write at this length because so much is being preached

of discipline, coaxed where they should have been com- 
manded, “interested” instead of being made to work. 
Be sure of yourself, never act until you know you , 
are in the right, but when you punish, punish thor- 
oughly. If the child is stubborn or resentful, it is 
because you have given him a mere tickling; he has 
not felt the sting. Make the child do as he is told. A 
second refusal must be instantly followed by a second 
switching. You must not allow the child to conquer 
you. Pay no attention to the insidious nonsense that 
the child is “educating himself” when he is struggling 
to get his own way. Do your duty. As the children 
get older, we should have got them to understand that 
punishment naturally follows wrongdoing. The child 
who dawdles over dressing should find that he is too 
late for the expected walk or other coveted pleasure; 
he who leaves toys about is too young to have them; he 
who is bad-mannered at table should be instantly re- 
moved so that others shall not be annoyed; the selfish 
child must play alone; the child who is fretful or who 
cries without cause needs rest in a quiet room. 
As a guide in deciding when a young child should 
be corrected for something done or omitted, and when 
it is best to ignore it, let us ask ourselves: Would such 
an incident or such a trait be objectionable five. years 
from to-day? And if we feel sure that it would be 
objectionable, it calls for correction and suppression 
and we must make up our minds that the opportune 
time to act is now. We must always be on the alert 
so to measure, and decide when to act and when to 
ignore. Give only such commands as must be given 
and then enforce them. 
Punishment, however, is only one phase of child
-P-A-G-E-60
52  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
management. It will be readily seen how much the 
physical well-being of a young child has to do with its 
disposition and behavior. Health and bodily comfort, 
good physical habits, exercise, food, drink, properly 
fitting garments, occupation—any one of these will 
make the difference between a good and a “bad” child. 
When baby gets tired, hungry, thirsty, or sleepy, it 
gets “cross” and naughty, and it is upset by unusual 
excitement or too much attention. Do not let a young 
child go too long without food, for even with a grown 
person that weak feeling in the stomach loosens self- 
control. If breakfast is early and dinner at noon, there 
should be a snack between ten and eleven, otherwise 
the child becomes ravenous and naturally naughty. 
One slice of bread and butter, an apple, or a glass of 
milk, will do. Let there be no sweets, for too much 
sugar is one of the deadly destroyers of a child’s nerves 
and discipline. In the afternoon, a nap almost takes 
the place of a lunch. 
Do your teaching and your disciplining in the morn- 
ing, when the child is most impressionable, rather than 
at the wane of day. A little child works hard, harder 
than we. He gets charged wtih a skinful of poisons, 
his nerves are tingling, and towards nightfall he is 
irritable and primed for trouble. I have known moth- 
ers who would start late in the afternoon to wrangle 
with a child and keep it up until both were exhausted. 
If ever naughtiness or fretfulness is to be overlooked, 
it should be late in the day, but this overlooking must 
not be done if the child is conscious of it. Change the 
whole milieu by a little fun, a game, a story, a drink 
of water (be sure the children get water often), a little 
petting and cuddling, or even by a tepid bath and by 
 
-P-A-G-E-61
  Discipline 53 
calling on the sandman for help. But in the morning, 
do not stand any nonsense. The first thing to make 
sure of is that the child has plenty to do. Think ahead 
and in the trouble-brewing period provide employment 
of some kind. See that he has toys, sticks with which 
to build a log house, or any kind of make-believe. 
Before you tell a child to do a thing, carefully con- 
sider whether he is able to do it, then say simply, do 
that thing and see that it is done without any remon- 
strance on his part. 
If anybody is present at such lessons, brook no inter- 
ference of any kind. Put your child’s welfare before 
any considerations of so-called politeness. Whoever 
in the child’s presence criticizes the mother’s or the 
father’s instructions or doings is consciously or uncon- 
sciously an emissary of the Evil One. 
“Jack, come to mother.” “Now, go to the door.” 
“Now, come to mother.” “Now, lay this newspaper 
on the table.’ Such are the simple lessons that 
will engender ready and unquestioning obedience, if 
thoughtfully and simply given and patiently and firmly 
enforced. Do not give two commands in one, but just 
one, simple and plain. 
The child’s first resistance to authority is playful; 
he pretends he is going to do a forbidden thing. But 
do not allow even a young child to run from you when 
called. It is not a wise way to play with a child, and 
later you must punish for the very trait you have 
inculcated. 
Give training in order and regularity. Let each 
child have a special nail or hook within reach for coat 
and cap, and make him hang these up when he 
comes in, seeing that he does do it every time, not occa-
-P-A-G-E-62
  54  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
sionally. This hanging up their things is a very good 
lesson to start with. When they have learned that this 
must be done every time, they will be ready to do other 
things as bidden, and their education will have made 
some progress in the right direction. 
The first lesson that a baby should be taught is 
“Stop!” “Don’t touch!” Whatever you tell a child 
not to do is negative education, which directs the child’s 
natural and instructive activation. This is followed 
by human and humane activity, the outcome of posi- 
tive education, which instructs the child what to do. 
In teaching “Don’t touch,” it is necessary, in order 
to make clear your meaning, to smack the little hands 
when they seize upon or do the thing forbidden. When 
thus taught from babyhood the child will have learned 
to obey when he reaches the age of four. 
To make a child do what it is bidden to do is more 
difficult. Refraining from what is forbidden, which 
is an act of self-control, is difficult enough at first, 
but it is a simple process, whereas the doing of what 
it is told is complex and the teaching takes a world of 
patience. Just as it is natural for a healthy, normal 
child to do what it is forbidden to do, so is it for the 
same child to refuse doing what it is bidden to do. 
It is the exacting, and sometimes painful duty of the 
parents to make the child control itself in these direc- 
tions through being controlled. 
Guard against giving a command until you have 
with sincere satisfaction to yourself answered the 
following questions: 
Is it necessary? 
Am I going to make the child obey? 
If he refuses, what shall I do?
-P-A-G-E-63
  Discipline fee 
Does this command conflict with any other com- 
mand or injunction? 
Give your commands in clear, unmistakable words 
and make the child understand what you mean. If he 
refuses to obey, act at once, without threatening or 
promising. The less you talk about disobedience and 
the less you threaten the better. While parental author- 
ity is right and natural, it is the loser by being talked 
about. Do not discuss spankings or other forms of 
punishment. Simply be everlastingly alive to the need 
of patience and persistence on your part, until the very 
last vestige of procrastination is broken up. Do not 
tell Jean to go to bed until you mean that she shall go, 
but do not then allow an instant’s temporizing. She 
should put Teddy down at once, without a single 
attempt at evasion, and trot off. Otherwise picture to 
yourself the unseemly clash of wills that must take 
place ten years hence. 
Now, concerning matters other than obedience, the 
why and wherefore of things in Nature and of many 
doings, explain as carefully as is consistent with the 
child’s understanding. Make him realize that there 
is a good reason for all good things, and for many 
things which we cannot regard as good. Make him see 
by your example that grown-up people have to do their 
work whether it is pleasurable or not, that you may 
not always feel like getting dinner, but that it must 
be done. Do not do this explaining on any occasion 
when the child wants to know why he is to do a certain 
thing, or when he protests, for the fewer the words 
then, the better, but when he is working around with 
you, these things may be told, letting him draw his 
own conclusions and apply them to himself,

Don’t scold. Don’t nag. 
Don’t explain too much. 
Don't talk too much. 
Don’t say Don’t except when necessary. 
Don’t give too many commands. 
Don’t depend upon reasoning as a means of disciplin- 
ing young children. 
Don’t beg where you should command. 
Don’t place on a child the burden of making decisions 
in matters which surpass his understanding. 
Don’t lead the child to dogmatize about what is good 
or what is bad. 
Don’t give the child a free rein because “he can be 
young only once.” 
Don’t leave it to the school to correct faults of char- 
acter. 
Don’t take short-cuts. 
Don’t interfere too much in the child’s play. 
Don’t make liars and hypocrites of the children by 
enforcing apologies as evidence of repentance. 
Don’t make profuse apologies to children when you 
find yourself in the wrong. Simply say: “I am 
sorry; I made a mistake.” This should be a suf- 
ficient acknowledgment. 
Don’t let the child think, “Oh, that is good enough,” 
when a thing is not done as well as he can do it, 
but use reason and measure in all things. 
Don’t expect a good habit to take hold instantly. 
Don’t remind a child of past punishments as a warning 
against misconduct. Face each new day anew. 
Don’t carry the matter of discipline too far. There

must be some elasticity. But between two ex- 
tremes, choose that it shall be too hard rather 
than too soft. 
DO’s 
Make the child adapt himself to actual conditions. 
Make him practice self-denial. 
Make him work without loss of time. 
Make him think before he speaks. 
Make him answer the question he is asked, not the 
one he had hoped would be asked. 
Lay down the law to your children, but do not mor- 
alize. They love you and will readily obey you if your 
commands are simple and just. 
«If each home were the center of law and order, we 
would have a happy, orderly state. There would be 
neither prisons nor poorhouses, and less need for 
schoolhouses or insane asylums. If every child were 
taught at home to be orderly, punctual, obedient, help- 
ful, he would know how to work, to mind, to attend, 
to listen. If he were then further taught to read and 
write, and to like helpful reading, this would be almost 
sufficient in most cases; in the remaining cases, the 
individual would seek for himself such learning as his 
predilections and inheritance make desirable for him. 
Each would be permitted to develop to his full height 
instead of being sent into a schoolroom where his speed 
may be restricted to’ that of the slowest members.
-P-A-G-E-66
  CHAPTER V 
DISCIPLINE: HABITS 
HapiT means an ease in exercising those powers 
and aptitudes which we possess the day we are born. 
What one does often one is led to do easily and nat- 
urally, with growing skill and certainty, and there is 
thus developed our characteristic behavior, in which it 
is scarcely possible to distinguish what is natural from 
what is habitual. Habit is second nature and in time 
overmasters nature. The source of habit is deep down 
in the very foundations of the understanding. It 
involves all the faculties: the memory, the power of 
thinking, the will, and the emotions. Its growth pro- 
duces a uniform and steadfast alteration in the nerv- 
ous system which is shown in two ways, increased 
power of performance and increased power of resist- 
ance. 
The process of education may be defined as the 
growth of new powers, in other words, the formation 
of habits. To understand the nature and laws of 
habit is to understand the principles of successful 
teaching; hence, to be successful, all education must 
be conducted in conformity with the maxims that 
govern the formation of habits, which has been called 
“the power of retentiveness.” For some habits a 
greater amount of practice is necessary than for oth- 
ers, for example, piano-playing compared with type- 
writing, In order to acquire new powers, much more 
58 
 
-P-A-G-E-67
  Discipline: Habits 59 
repetition is necessary for some persons than for oth- 
ers, a fact which is illustrated in every family. Other 
points quite as important for the mother ‘to bear in 
mind are, first, that the individual is much more sus- 
ceptible to habit-formation during early childhood than 
in any later period, and second, that exercises to pro- 
mote habit-growth are productive only when right 
bodily conditions prevail. 
There is nothing in human makeup more striking 
than the young child’s adaptability to habit-making. 
With every atom of bodily or mental effort, each 
glance of the eye, each movement of a muscle, he is 
making or unmaking a habit, which emphasizes our 
twofold responsibility in equipping him so that his soul 
may reach the greatest heights it can attain. This two- 
fold responsibility involves training him so that in his 
efforts to rise he shall not be weighted down by bad 
habits, and so drilling him that ordinary matters may 
be relegated to the lower nerve centers, leaving the 
intellect free for pioneering. The teacher-mother’s 
first concern should be what acts to check before they 
become habitual and what habits to cultivate. 
The school cannot make habits in children, for the 
habits of school children are already made. The time 
to establish fundamental habits is during that period 
when child nature hungers for repetition and regu- 
larity, however irksome it may be for the mother to 
insure such regularity. On the basis of correct habits 
ingrained during the first seven years of life should 
be built moral habits: reverence, truthfulness, honest 
dealing, contentment, passive and active courage, which 
will be discussed elsewhere. Our present concern is 
with that early plastic period when parental authority 
 
-P-A-G-E-68
  60 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
is most easily and naturally exerted, since it is the 
main factor in habit-making. 
“Of course I want my child to form correct habits,” 
says a mother, “but if I compel him to do even these 
necessary things, am I not weakening his will by thus 
going constantly against his inclinations?” No, for 
inclination is not properly a part of willing. Com- 
pared with habit, the human will, and even human 
reasoning, are pitifully weak. Besides, a strong will, 
as opposed to mere stubbornness and wrong-headed- 
ness, is based on the ability to reason about right and 
wrong, and this ability does not develop until after our 
characteristic habits are already formed. A child’s 
wilfulness is not will at all, but lack of restraint. 
Every time you make a child do the right thing you 
are strengthening the habit of doing that thing. This 
holds true whether the initial doing is pleasurable or 
the reverse. As soon as the act becomes habitual, it 
thereby becomes agreeable and the reverse correspond- 
ingly disagreeable. Look where you please, you will 
find evidence of this amazing adaptability of the human 
system to a compulsory mode of life, typified by Chil- 
lon’s prisoner, who learned to love his chains. Chil- 
dren can get accustomed to anything. You can teach 
them to love a life of order and cleanliness only by 
compelling them to do the things that contribute to 
such a life. Compulsion is a proper and necessary part 
of habit-training, but the more good sense is used the 
less force is necessary. If punishment has to be fre- 
quently or systematically resorted to, there is some- 
thing wrong with either the child or with the environ- 
ment. 
To have a regular daily schedule and abide by it
-P-A-G-E-69
  Discipline: Habits 61 
makes the work of child training simple and compara- 
tively easy. Order is heaven’s first law. The whole 
universe moves on schedule time. The birds come back 
to us on time in the spring; the sun and moon and stars 
rise and set on time. Indeed, so orderly and prompt are 
the heavenly bodies in their movements that wise men 
can calculate for thousands of years ahead the date 
and the exact time of day when the earth’s face will 
be darkened by the shadow of the moon. The same 
natural law that keeps the stars in their places ought 
to regulate the daily life of the household in its larger 
aspects. Child nature is very sensitive to changes; 
even the infant demands regularity and unconsciously 
rebels against a broken schedule. “Gadding about,” 
idleness, and the proneness to disobedience resulting 
therefrom very often spring from a lack of carefully 
planned occupation, from not knowing ‘“‘what comes 
next,” from not having a regular program strictly 
enforced. 
From the age of three every child should have some 
little daily responsibilities of which he should be re- 
minded at the proper time, for a child’s time-sense is 
weak and he often confuses morning and afternoon, 
especially after a nap. Children are healthier and hap- 
pier when usefully employed, and need carefully 
planned physical tasks. There must be regular work, 
from the regular performance of which there is no 
escape, and such tasks as must be done every day 
should be done at the same hour every day and in the 
same order. There can be no successful teaching from 
books until the child has been trained by the daily 
round of tasks and duties to know that “do it’ means 
exertion to the point of accomplishment.
-P-A-G-E-70
  62 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
Draw up a good daily program and keep it up with- 
out too much in the way of diversion. Make your 
children conform to it. Get the codperation of your 
family and start in at once; not too radically at first, 
for you would not be able to keep that up. Be reso- 
lute; do not attempt too many new things at a time; 
‘do not undertake to cure all the family faults at once; 
do not discuss with the children the change that is to 
take place, but carry out your plans and make them 
abide by them; establish one new habit or practice 
before introducing another. Have certain hours for 
those unavoidable activities of every day, such as rising, 
meals, cleaning, going to bed. A great time-saver for 
every member of the household, children included, is 
the certain knowledge that meals will always be on 
time, and to have them so is less troublesome than not. 
Do not struggle with details at first, but put all your 
energy into planning systematic work and play, lessons, 
and recreation. Get the schedule running smoothly, 
so that each individual member of the family has a 
time for each thing and begins forming or perfecting 
the habit of doing things on time. When that is accom- 
plished, it will be easy to work out details. 
On the other hand, it is possible to go too far in 
systematizing life, to become punctilious. I have 
known people who would even plan every moment of 
time for a guest down to the quarter-hours. When a 
schedule is once running with perfect smoothness, I 
would not hesitate to disturb it if a bigger thing is 
involved. If, for instance, I had to choose between 
making my beds on time or having a conversation with 
an unexpected old friend, the beds should wait, but I 
would squeeze in the time for making the beds with-
-P-A-G-E-71
  
Discipline: Habits 63 
out disturbing the rest of the household. Good man- 
agement easily overcomes such welcome interruptions. 
When children awake, they should not lie in bed but 
get up, dress, and busy themselves at whatever is suit- 
able. Never allow them to read or to play in bed, for 
the practice of allowing a healthy child to lie in bed 
until it pleases him to get up may mar his whole after 
life and create serious difficulties for him and others. 
As soon as children are able to use their arms and 
fingers, they should become accustomed to dress them- 
selves, and sickness alone should excuse them from 
this. Insist that dressing and undressing be done in 
good order and that propriety is indispensable. Can 
your children put on their shoes and stockings while 
standing, first on one foot and then on the other? 
Have them take pride in doing this, just as they would 
in any form of athletics. This one little daily perform- 
ance is powerful, for its size, in offsetting slothful 
tendencies and in arousing sluggish dispositions. Cor- 
rect slovenly practices, such as allowing a child to 
remain in the bathtub for half an hour or so, which 
leads to other slovenly and naughty habits of body and 
mind. Break up the practice of dawdling at dressing. 
When the boy, after being duly warned, does not get 
dressed on time, surprise him with a switch on the bare 
skin. If he knows that this may be expected every 
morning, you will see a modern miracle worked. 
The child’s nap should be carefully regulated by 
the mother and should on no account be left to his 
caprices. He should be sent to bed at a certain time 
and made to lie there quietly for a stated period, and 
if he refuses to do this, punish him promptly, without 
lengthy explanation. Simply tell him that he must
-P-A-G-E-72
  64  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
do as he is told. He understands very well when he 
is disobeying in such a matter. 
Make the child finish each and every suitable task 
given, in spite of any difficulties he may encounter. 
Do not call him from one task to another, nor allow 
him to leave a task unfinished in order to play. Make 
him do even the simplest tasks in the right way. Such 
tasks are: closing doors and drawers gently; straight- 
ening things in disorder, as a rug, books on a shelf, 
and so on, picking up things carelessly thrown about, 
as matches on the floor, and the like, hanging cap and 
coat each on its individual hook, scraping shoes on the 
mat or scraper before coming indoors, eating without 
mussing about the food, washing hands and face if 
necessary, and combing hair before meals and before 
going to bed. All this must be done in a simple, unpre- 
tentious, unaffected way, so as not to engender fastidi- 
ousness, for all extremes are objectionable. It is too 
much to expect a boy of eight to worry about patches 
of Mother Earth on neck or ears, undue concern about 
such trifles being an indication that he is not a real 
boy. Make him wash, of course, but do not bewail 
his lack of interest in esthetics at this age. 
One never sees a child with a single bad habit, for 
the reason that one fault uncorrected leads to so many 
others that before long all good traits seem to be hope- 
lessly smothered in a wild growth. If we can keep 
down the weeds until the good seed gets a chance to 
take root and establish itself, the work of the teacher- 
mother daily becomes easier. Do not overlook a fault 
on one occasion in the hope that it will not occur again, 
for either it or its twin sister will. When children 
get naughty, intervene with rigor. Little by little sup-
-P-A-G-E-73
  
Discipline: Habits 65 
press all those things which they must not do. We 
shall have something now to say on bad habits and 
their correction between the ages of two or three and 
about seven. These are mainly physical, yet so closely 
are they interwoven with the moral and mental habits 
treated in later chapters that the separate classification 
is more apparent than real. 
Do not allow children to develop an aversion to any 
kind of wholesome food, but make them eat at least a 
small portion of everything that in your judgment is 
good and fit for them to have. They should eat what- 
ever mother gives them to eat, simply because she has 
chosen and provided it, and every healthy and well- 
reared child will do so. If matters have gone so far 
that children actually cannot eat wholesome food some- 
body has spoiled them and is responsible for it. Ifa 
whim concerning food is not checked, it develops into 
a self-suggested digestive defect. The happiness of 
many has been frustrated in this way by indulgence 
which has led to incurable invalidism. Without plain, 
wholesome food the internal organs refuse to work 
and the system gets clogged, so, dispensing with any 
preliminary talking or cajoling, give the child a tea- 
spoonful of the vegetable on the table which you con- 
sider necessary and which, as you know from previous 
experience, he is going to refuse, and make him eat it. 
Repeat this on every similar occasion and after a little 
while the dislike will have worn off and the quantity 
can be gradually increased. If the child betrays dislike 
of acertain food, do not talk about it, or coax, but sim- 
ply put a teaspoonful on his plate and tell him that 
he must eat it before he gets anything else. What to 
do to enforce this order will depend somewhat on the
-P-A-G-E-74
  
66 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
way he acts, for it will not be easy, but the situation 
must be faced, and the earlier the better. 
You will probably find it much harder to discipline 
him if even one other person is at the table, for a child 
generally learns that there is safety in numbers. If in 
the presence of a third person he refuses to eat such a 
small portion, you should then remove him and the 
plate of food to another room, take him on your lap 
and make him eat it, just as you would give him neces- 
sary medicine. The one mouthful or two will not be 
hard to deal with, but if he is out-and-out stubborn, I 
recommend the switch. If he merely protests, “I 
can’t,” your determination to make him eat will suf- 
fice. The first struggle will be the hard one. 
Do not bring up a child on the so-many-ounces-a- 
day method, or the three-meals-a-day régime. Who 
would feed little chicks on the same plan as pullets and 
cockerels? Use your own judgment and discretion, 
taking actual conditions into consideration. On the 
other hand, it is just as unwise to let a child run to the 
bread-basket or cake-box whenever he likes. Try to 
keep the happy medium between irregularity in any 
shape or form and pedantic punctiliousness. 
Sometimes a mother is distressed by the discovery 
that a young child is eating whatever he happens to 
pick up, and is forming a habit. One mother writes 
of a three-year-old child: “He eats lint and fuzz off 
blankets or wool of any kind, even eating the sleeves 
out of his nightgown. I have tried to break him, but 
it seems impossible.” Now a child is likely to form 
any kind of habit and the chewing of lint, etc., is 
simply one of those habits that children form if you let 
them. A child of three will naturally crawl about the
-P-A-G-E-75
  
Discipline: Habits 67 
floor picking up anything to chew, but every time you 
see him do it smack his hands sharply. 
Thumb-sucking. 
An extremely bad habit that appears at an early age 
is thumb-sucking. If a child develops it, make him 
sleep in coarse thumbless mittens fastened to the sleeves 
so that they cannot be pulled off, and if necessary, try 
this also during the day. If no good results after a 
reasonable time, make a paste of bitter aloes and a 
little water and put some of it under his nails. The 
deterrent taste lasts for days and this corrective rarely 
fails. Repeat when necessary, but if, after patient and 
sufficiently long application, the outcome seems doubt- 
ful mix some Cayenne pepper or a few drops of tabasco 
sauce with the bitter aloes. If, after all, thumb- 
sucking has become a habit, it is not the child’s fault 
so much as that of somebody who ought to have de- 
tected it in its earliest stages, when it could have been 
stopped with comparative ease. 
Nail-biting. 
Nail-biting is a cause of nervousness, not an effect, 
and begins usually at a later age than thumb-sucking. 
It saps the child’s energy and diverts his attention, is 
unbecoming and unmannerly, and encourages naughti- 
ness in many other directions. It should be broken up 
before it gets to be a habit. This and the allied habit 
of nail-picking, regarded from a purely materialistic 
point of view, involve unshapely fingers, unhealthy 
nails, a slobbering mouth, and an altogether-unkissable 
child. Bitter aloes may be used in this case as a re- 
minder. To deprive the child of something very much 
coveted whenever the nails dfe broken usually works, 
and is a more suitable means of disciplining him than
-P-A-G-E-76
68  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
offering a reward for overcoming the habit. Nature 
does not hold out rewards for obediences, but she 
makes us forego pleasures for disobediences. 
Left-handedness. 
When a left-handed child comes to my school, I 
correct the objectionable habit by making him take 
chalk, pencil, scissors, hammer, stick, etc., in his right 
hand every time, without much or any discussion, sim- 
ply the direction, “Use your right hand.” Sometimes 
it takes weeks, sometimes months, but there is no real 
difficulty if you keep at it, and the highly desirable 
result makes it worth while. It is a good thing for 
children to learn early that they can do practically any- 
thing within reason that they set out to do. How many 
accidentally disabled grown persons have learned to 
substitute the use of the left hand for that of the 
right! It is true that left-handedness is caused by an 
abnormal condition in the right hemisphere of the cere- 
brum, but by early and patient practice the defect can 
be overcome. This is one of the many cases where the 
exertion of will power can overcome physical defects 
or abnormalities, while the non-exertion of will power 
may develop them. 
Temper. 
How often do we find instances of a little child 
flying into a passion and attempting to strike its mother 
when corrected. It seems almost too terrible for belief 
that a mother should find herself helpless in such a situ- 
ation and wonder if possibly she herself is not wrong 
in attempting to “coerce” a child of five. Let a mother 
who awakens to such a situation ask herself what she 
will have to face when her daughter is ten, twelve, 
fourteen, sixteen, and wants her own way about com- 
   
-P-A-G-E-77
  Discipline: Habits 69 
panionship that is dangerous or recreations that are 
sinful. The mother who allows her child to strike her 
or to strike at her is unfit to have the care of dumb 
brutes, not to speak of human souls, Punish a child 
for the very first exhibition of temper towards father 
or mother, and it will quickly learn to control itself. 
Contradicting. 
A child is prone to contradict; the tendency is as 
natural as teething, but it can and should be broken up 
in time. Any child who is old enough to contradict is 
old enough not to contradict. Punish instantly and 
unfailingly when the child breaks into the conversa- 
tion of grown persons to set them right. A child who 
cannot listen respectfully and quietly while his elders 
speak should not have the privilege of remaining where 
they are; hence the natural and most suitable punish- 
ment is to send him at once out of the room,’ If this 
is done calmly and firmly every time it will be effective. 
Fear in the Dark. 
A child that has been frightened in the dark, or who 
for any reason fears the dark, is not “making believe,” 
and cannot be cured by heroic measures, but must be 
reassured by words and actions. It will be difficult to 
reéstablish right habits after such a deplorable thing 
has happened, but there is no help for that; she has 
had the fright, and it will wear off only very gradually. 
Do not try to drive out the Devil with Beelzebub. 
Someone should stay with the child until she is sound 
asleep, but do this in a way that will prevent her from 
realizing your sympathy with her fright to be the 
motive. Put her to sleep where she can hear you talk- 
ing, or make an excuse to do your sewing or reading 
within reach, until this suggested or auto-suggested
-P-A-G-E-78
  70 ~ Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
fear wears off. A little talking in a natural way may 
do a little good, but you cannot reason with so young 
a child, and you cannot reason fear of the dark out of 
any child under ten. You can only calm her by your 
own unconcern. Go yourself very frequently on an 
errand into a dark room, purposely taking no light. 
Do not comment on not being afraid, for that in itself 
suggests fear. Decline taking a light on the ground 
that you know where to find what you want in the 
dark. Protect a child by all means from getting a 
fright. Never permit fun or games that involve 
frightening anyone, for death or insanity might result, 
or at the least, a lifelong timidity. 
Whining. 
After making certain that a child who whines is 
physically well, deal with this fault as with other 
naughtiness discussed in this and the preceding chap- 
ter. Discipline is the cure. It is with you, mothers, 
that the main struggle will lie—to be on your guard 
against making the slightest concession to cajoling and 
sulking, to importunities, teasings, tears, demands, sub- 
terfuges. Your word must mean something definite. 
Only when you can so get hold of yourself is it fair 
or helpful to punish the child for overstepping the 
bounds. 
How often have I had in my school, pupils who 
never attempted to gain anything from me by whining 
or teasing, who always spoke to me in a natural tone 
of voice, yet whose voices took on that abominable 
whine the very minute they crossed the home threshold; 
even long after their mothers had ceased to yield to 
their whinings. The physical habit persisted, without
-P-A-G-E-79
  Discipline: Habits 71 
the child’s volition or knowledge, just as a scar betrays 
a wound long healed. 
When a child whines or cries easily, it may be that 
his stomach is out of order. Many children are “bad” 
because their stomachs are soured with sweets, for a 
surfeit of sugar works havoc in the system, where a 
small, well-balanced quantity would be helpful and 
salutary. Correct this, see that the child’s crying gets 
him nothing, and have him realize that you will not 
and cannot hear him when he whines, but that as soon 
as he stops whining and is pleasant and sensible, you 
are ready to listen to him. 
If the child cries when disappointed, remove him 
instantly, without threat or discussion, to a room by 
himself. You will soon find that crying rarely occurs. 
Surprise him by taking quick action, without previous 
warning or threat, and by simply removing him to a 
safe place where he can annoy no one. This effectual 
tit-for-tat will quickly help him to regain self-control. 
Pouting. 
Do not specifically watch to catch a child pouting, 
but on the other hand, do not pretend not to see it when 
he knows very well that you have done so. Make him 
understand clearly that he must submit quietly and 
uncomplainingly to your correction. If he goes from 
pouting to defiance or attempted disobedience, have 
your switch ready and use it around his legs until he 
is a thoroughly subdued young man. 
Stubbornness. 
Give only commands that the child can carry out, 
give them in a way that cannot be misunderstood, and 
if the child then refuses to obey, take down the switch
-P-A-G-E-80
  72  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
and use it around the little legs until he does obey. 
After you have succeeded with this first severe lesson, 
make a point at least once a day of calling the child 
to you from play. Make him stand in front of you as 
a soldier stands at attention and look you in the eye 
while you give him a simple direction: “Go to the 
kitchen, find the broom and bring it to me,” or some 
similar order. Require him to say, ‘Yes, mother,” or 
“Very well, mother,” and comply instantly. Always 
choose for these lessons something that you can un- 
questionably make the child do, for constant practice 
in executing simple commands makes him docile and 
teachable, and when he has learned to obey readily in 
minute matters, he will not oppose his will to yours 
in more important ones. 
Give a series of simple directions, as: Walk to the 
end of the path; stand still; turn to the right; turn 
again to the right; run back to mother. Invent such 
instructions, never involving more than one command. 
These things are simple, but not easy. Five minutes 
a day of such training may well be given, insisting 
upon proper positions in standing and always insisting 
upon correct breathing. 
Teasing. 
Never allow older people to tease a child, or in any 
way to get amusement or entertainment at the child’s 
expense, for it is ruinous to the child’s disposition and 
unfair. If the child has any rights, one of them is to 
be exempt from heartless teasing. As for the teasing 
of younger children by older brothers and sisters, you 
must abstain from too conspicuous interfering, for the 
younger must naturally submit to some teasing, which 
will do them good. However, any attempt of the older 
   
-P-A-G-E-81
  Discipline: Habits 73 
to be cruel or really unkind must be sternly suppressed. 
Do this tactfully and avoid even the semblance of par- 
tiality. It is very hard indeed to know just when to 
interfere among children, but while the fun is innocent 
and not too hard on the victims, it is well sometimes 
not to see too much, for it is thus that children learn 
to take their own part. 
Nervousness. 
Nervousness is lack of self-control. If we think of 
it in this light, it becomes an easier matter to trace the 
cause and find the remedy. Children who are permit- 
ted to sit up late or to go frequently to parties and 
moving pictures are nervous. They cannot stand the 
vividness and variety of the impressions received. 
Showing off children, or treating them like grown-ups 
instead of like children, is bound to react to their hurt. 
Nervousness is entirely too often the fault of delin- 
quent parents. 
To overcome nervousness, keep in mind the old edu- 
cational principle: Stability takes precedence over 
change. Do not allow stability to be counteracted by 
faddish changes and freakish alterations. Aim at regu- 
larity in your daily program. Keep out frivolity and 
diversion. Do not listen to such insidious devices for 
gaining applause as: “The poor children get tired of 
_ the same thing over and over. They ought to learn 
through play. Interest them. Do not make them work. 
Their lives will be hard enough when they grow up.” 
Do not listen to such counsel unless you want to bring 
up a generation of sans-culottes, compared with whom 
Marat would appear as a gentle angel, but if you want 
to rear a generation of strong, sturdy, courageous 
men and women, make your children get satisfaction
-P-A-G-E-82
  74  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
from stability, not delight from change. No one reme- 
dial agent will do so much to overcome nervousness as 
the regular daily program to which the child must 
conform, in the large outlines of which he is in no way 
consulted. Not idleness but a combination of play 
and work is remedial. Strict discipline develops will 
power, which in turn overcomes nervousness. A great 
many mothers make the mistake of humoring a delicate 
child, whereas the opposite treatment is more needed 
in such cases than with a healthy child. 
Keep the child from hearing himself discussed or 
from being conspicuously talked to, avoid singling 
him out from the group, and if possible prevent others 
from doing so. Protect him from well-meant blandish- 
ments that make for self-consciousness. Reciting be- 
fore others lays the foundation for inordinate self- 
esteem, impertinence, nervousness, and unnaturalness, 
unless most tactful discretion is observed. Public reci- 
tations by a child may become a potent factor for bad 
as well as for good. 
When a child is nervous and wriggles continually, 
make this your point of attack. Suppress the naughty 
wriggling and you may find that what you call nerv- 
ousness has been nothing but naughtiness of the com- 
mon or garden variety. Wriggling is plainly a bad 
habit, to be met almost universally in school children. 
Their fingers are twitching, they want to handle a pen 
or pencil or other object, they twist their clothing. 
Until this habit has been overcome the child’s mind 
will always be diverted and wandering, it will not be 
receptive to the best and most expert teaching, because 
the pupil lacks the indispensable mental stamina. A 
good teacher will not begin or continue a lesson until 
 
-P-A-G-E-83
  
Discipline: Habits 75 
each pupil is sitting quietly and composedly at atten- 
tion, yet American children, even from the very best 
of homes, are so badly trained in this respect that a 
conscientious teacher uses fully as much effort and 
voice to secure intelligent attention as she does in giv- 
ing the purely mental training. How often have I 
said to the mothers of my pupils: “If you would only 
discipline your children to sit properly and stand qui- 
etly for even two minutes at a time before starting 
them for school, I could teach them twice as much 
there as they now learn.” 
Train children to walk, stand, and sit properly, with 
body erect, shoulders back, and head up; when they 
sit their feet should rest squarely on the floor (hence 
they should have seats of the right height), their hands 
should be quiet, the entire body composed. Time the 
child in this posture for one minute, later increasing 
it to two, and when he reaches the age of seven or 
thereabouts, three minutes. Do not read to him or 
tell him a story until he is thus in control of himself. 
Do this every day, making it an important part of his 
present training, in fact, as the first exercise of his daily 
lesson, until he has formed the habit of controlling 
himself. A simple and effective help in this lesson is 
to make him first sit or stand, then walk with a shal- 
low vessel of water on his head, twice a day for a few 
minutes at a time, in order to gain control and poise. 
Habits in Illness. 
When a child is ill its whims and fancies should in 
no way influence any decisions concerning its treat- 
ment, but it should be ruled by an intelligent, inflexible, 
patient will. Every good physician who takes charge 
of a case gives his orders and insists that they be car-  
-P-A-G-E-84
  76  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
ried out, no matter how great, how wise, how scholarly 
his patient be. 
Certain practical lessons, such as those concerned 
with orderliness, should not be omitted during sickness. 
Do not excuse leaving toys about, for example, or 
because he does not feel well refrain from making the 
child put them properly away. The effect of such 
indulgence would be bad for the health, instead of bene- 
ficial. Use judgment at all times about lessons, and 
if you see a child getting peevish or tired, drop them 
for the time being, for there is more danger of over- 
teaching than underteaching. At the same time, guard 
against conscious or unconscious shamming, few things 
being more puzzling than to meet and treat the child’s 
instinctive recourse to shamming in order to gain his 
desired end. 
The child’s state of health has an important bearing 
on the kind and measure of instruction fitted for him. 
He should not be asked to memorize or to repeat les- 
sons on days when he is ill nor on the following day 
if you have reason to believe that exhaustion remains. 
At such a time he should not give, but he should be 
given to. Lessons consume a certain amount of nerve 
force which under such conditions is necessary for 
bodily growth and health. When the child is not well 
do not even ask him to recite poetry, for even though 
he have it perfectly memorized, the mental effort to 
reproduce it may then be too great, but if he wants 
to recite, well and good. Do not repeat poems or 
stories to him unless he asks for them, and then have 
something ready that does not tend to make him 
gloomy, for it is hard to foresee the construction that 
a child may put on the plainest and simplest verses.
-P-A-G-E-85
  
Discipline: Habits 77 
Tell the kind of stories he likes, repeating familiar 
rather than new ones, in order to spare him the effort 
of constructing new mind-pictures. 
Let him have his dog in the room for amusement, 
or get a kitten so that he can play with it or watch it 
play with spools or balls of yarn. Get plasticene and 
let him model dogs, cats, anything that strikes his 
fancy. It does not matter whether it resembles any- 
thing or not so long as he is pleased with it. Wax 
crayons and large sheets of drawing paper will give 
him material for drawing pine trees, wigwams, children 
running or walking or lying down. Harmless non- 
sense is best for a sick child. 
Self-consciousness. 
The sources of self-consciousness are self-compla- 
cency and self-importance, which are fed by the praises 
of overfond parents, doting relatives, and irresponsi- 
ble admirers of the poor child. Self-consciousness, 
once firmly rooted and established, cannot but be de- 
structive to the defenseless young soul, mind, and body, 
for it may grow into that crass egotism which wants 
to make the whole universe subservient to the poor 
and puny self. It is the bounden duty of parents to 
guard the child against thoughtless adulation. Do not 
discuss the child in her presence, even with her father, 
still less with others. Do such talking privately and 
keep jealously from her the fact that any discussion 
has taken place. 
Egotism. 
The child so afflicted has been encouraged to fancy 
that the world revolves around her, which is not to be 
wondered at, for none of us is praise-proof. We 
swallow the clumsiest bait of flattery as greedily as the
-P-A-G-E-86
  78  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
dumb gudgeon takes the slimy worm on “Huckle- 
berry Finn’s” bent and twisted pin. Now, I have not 
a word to say against giving well-deserved praise to a 
little child, as long as it be given moderately and spar- 
ingly, but on the other hand, in every morsel of exces- 
sive praise which she receives are lurking the germs of 
egotism. 
Precocity. 
If a child seems old for her years, it can only be due 
to circumstances which are either unfriendly or antago- 
nistic to natural mental development. Being much in 
the company of her elders would further this trait, as 
would also talking much to her on matters incongruous 
with her age, reasoning, explaining, and moralizing 
too much. Parents, and still more outsiders, are habit- 
ually careless in their discussions and conversations in 
the presence of the little ones. Because a child seems 
absorbed in play, they fancy that she is not paying 
attention, but it may safely be taken for granted that 
she is always doing so. Counteract her precocity by 
speaking less to her, by confining your talk to childish 
matters, that is, matters rightfully within her com- 
prehension; tell or read to her the stories and fairy 
tales that develop her fancy and imagination, animal 
stories being suitable for this, especially tales in which 
the animals talk. Leave her to play by herself if she 
be so inclined, but if not, persuade or compel her to do 
it. Find suitable playmates for her, younger compan- 
ions being better for her than older ones. 
Clipping Words. 
The practice of clipping words should be stopped 
at once. Insist that the child take time to speak clearly 
and distinctly, and to enunciate very plainly and cor-
-P-A-G-E-87
  
Discipline: Habits 79 
rectly. This acts like the curb on a spirited young 
horse. The main objection to hurried, incorrect, 
slovenly, and jerky speech is not so much the destruc- 
tive effect upon language, but the effect upon the whole 
mentality, which is indissolubly connected with lan- 
guage. So often it is said that a child stutters or stam- 
mers because he is nervous, whereas the fact is that 
he is nervous because he stutters or stammers. 
If you will take note of persons who speak with too 
great volubility, you will find that the fault is due to 
a quick, petulant character. If you train the manner 
of speaking, you improve the character. Make the 
child use chest-tones, the way to do so being to use 
them yourself and have the child imitate you. When 
she screws up her voice to a high pitch, correct her, 
making her speak softly and clearly, with full tones. 
Make her breathe deeply before talking, and you can 
play games with her in which you lower your own 
voice into your chest, leading her to imitate your 
chest-tones. If a child has a weak throat, it is espe- 
cially important that she learn to do this. 
Stammering and Other Speech Defects. 
Most speech defects can be overcome if taken in 
time and persistently treated. The cure rests on keep- 
ing the child in good physical condition, on establish- 
ing self-control through firm discipline, on an elemen- 
tary knowledge of the way speech is produced, on pa- 
tience and persistence in making the child practice care- 
ful and correct utterance. Stammering is due to lack 
of control over the organs of speech, and very seldom 
arises from organic defect. It may be aggravated by 
depression of spirits, digestive disturbances, or physi- 
cal debility, but these influences have nothing to do  
-P-A-G-E-88
  80 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
with the cause. The remedy is to acquire control over 
the act of breathing and the use of the vocal organs. 
The early years of a child’s life are those in which a 
cure is most easily effected. Parents should not defer 
effort in the hope that impediments or defects of speech 
will disappear when the child realizes their objection- 
ableness. This result does not follow, and even if it 
did the child has in the mean time suffered mortifica- 
tion and acquired nervousness. 
There are a few easily understood suggestions that 
the parents can apply: 
1. Study the processes of speech, the relation of the 
breath to vocal sounds, the position of the tongue in 
shaping the outward stream of air; and practice sep- 
arately making the different vowel and consonant 
sounds, noting in each the position of the tongue. 
2. Keep in mind that speech is breath—that all 
sounds originate in the throat, that the passage of the 
throat must be kept open. 
3. Teach the pupil before beginning to speak to 
get control of himself, his thoughts, his breath, his 
voice. Practice deep breathing with the child. When 
one is threatened with loss of self-control through 
fear, anger, or any other cause, instant help comes 
from taking a deep breath. 
4. Make the child think before he speaks, so that 
he knows exactly what he is going to say. This adds 
to his self-confidence. 
5. Do not allow him to continue talking when he 
begins in the wrong way. Make him stop at once, 
think what he wants to say, take a deep breath, and 
speak slowly. 
Bear in mind that harshness, impatience, scolding,
-P-A-G-E-89
Discipline: Habits 81 
irritability, punishment, ridicule, are as much out of 
place in dealing with such defects as in dealing with a 
broken leg. If the child could help it, be sure that he 
would. If he is still too young to be sensitive about 
his impediment, this is so much the more reason that 
infinite patience should be shown in helping him to 
overcome the unfortunate habit. A firm, kindly voice 
and manner help the child to control himself and to 
make effective effort. Avoid too much talking, criti- 
cizing, or suggesting, simply instruct him “Do this,” 
taking compliance for granted. Success and failure 
should alike be met with a smile and a word of encour- 
agement and if the parents do their part failure will 
cease after a while. 
Stuttering differs somewhat from stammering, the 
source of this difficulty lying mainly in the lower jaw. 
When this is brought under control and the effort 
to speak transferred from the mouth to the throat, 
where it belongs, speech comes fluently enough. Use 
the same means as advised to overcome stammering. 
Many forms of defective speech, such as inability 
to pronounce certain vowel or consonant sounds, owe 
their origin simply to want of proper direction and 
training when the child is learning to talk. One of the 
elementary sounds most liable to mispronunciation is 
S, which gives rise to lisping. This consists in apply- 
ing the tongue to the teeth or gum so as to force the 
breath over the sides instead of over the center of the 
tongue. The sound of L is likewise often defective, 
common substitutes of one sound for another are T for 
K, D for G, N for Ng, S or Z for Th, S for Sh, ete. 
Defects in pronunciation and enunciation should be 
dealt with one at a time, until each is overcome. Study 
   
-P-A-G-E-90
  82  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
how each sound is made, practicing it before a mirror 
so that you discern the position of the tongue, teeth, and 
lips. When giving a lesson, make the child sit or stand 
directly in front of you, watching your mouth and 
imitating you in making the sound. Prolong and 
exaggerate the sounds, having the child make them 
with you. If, for instance, he says “tat” for “cat,” 
put your finger on the tip of his tongue and keep it 
down, so as to prevent his placing it against the roof 
of his mouth while making the K sound. He thus 
learns where to place his tongue to say Kuh. 
Practice only one new sound in a lesson, and practice 
this same lesson for a week or a month, if need be, 
until the child makes the sound correctly. Have short 
lessons, perhaps five or ten minutes in duration, once 
or twice a day, regularly and punctually. Do not nag 
the child between times about the sounds. This differs 
from the plan to correct stammering, which should be 
dealt with every time he speaks incorrectly. 
In order to put the child at his ease, make him forget 
self, and leave the mind free to attend to the lessons; it 
is a good plan to have fun in practicing these lessons. 
Thus without nervous tension, the vocal organs more 
readily assume the natural position, the glottis remains 
open, and the child easily imitates you. Vary the les- 
son with a young child by having him run away and 
repeat the newly mastered sound to the dog, the cat, 
the geranium, then come back and tell you just how he 
said it. 
Even though no apparent progress has been made in 
a week, keep right on, not as if you were instructing, 
but as if this were an enjoyable game, and only when 
the child succeeds in mastering a single difficult sound
-P-A-G-E-91
  
Discipline: Habits 83 
begin with another sound. Mothers who follow this® 
plan with young pupils nearly always succeed in over- 
coming these defects and impediments in a single year. 
Let me add that not only are the results unquestionably 
desirable, but the effect of this careful training has 
the same good influence on mind and body that results 
from any careful, methodical instruction which is 
suited to the child’s age and needs. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
CHAPTER VI 
TRAINING CHILDREN TO OBSERVE 
WHEN the great naturalist, Agassiz, was asked what 
he considered the most importaint work of his life, he 
answered, “I have helped men to observe.” By ob- 
servation we do not mean simply seeing, for we may 
observe through taste, touch, smell, and hearing, as 
well as sight. The sense of touch, for instance, is more 
primitive than even that of hearing or sight, and is 
certainly not less important than the other senses. The 
child gets the idea of form through the fingers rather 
than through the eye, and trusts more to the sense of 
touch than to that of sight, not being satisfied, for 
instance, that no more cakes remain in the dish until he 
has explored it with his hands. At three months the 
baby will grasp with the hand and this tendency to 
rely upon muscular sensations develops rapidly, yet 
if this sense is not properly cultivated it begins to lose 
its keenness when the child is about six. 
The sense of smell is not only a wonderful safe- 
guard, but serves beyond any other sense to bring 
quickly and distinctly to the mind scenes and memories 
of long ago that otherwise would be lost. Neither 
sight nor sound is so potent as odor in stirring deep- 
lying recollections. Fifty years hence the odor of nar- 
cissus will recall to Barbara the beautiful gift she 
received when the world was young to her—and its 
giver, The sense of smell is weak in young children, 
84
-P-A-G-E-93
  Training Children to Observe 85 
but by training and practice one of the most useful 
roads to the mind may become so extended and the 
field of perception so enormously enlarged that, as 
in Luther Burbank’s case, the man’s usefulness to the 
world becomes intensified beyond measurement. Bur- 
bank made himself famous by smelling in a field of 
unscented blossoming verbena a single plant with an 
arbutus-like odor. This he discovered by crawling on 
all-fours through the field, and from it he raised the 
sweet-scented verbena. Long practice had enabled him 
to extend his smelling-range beyond the usual area. 
The ear demands employment and training, the 
importance of which may be judged from the fact that 
congenitally deaf persons are usually also dumb, for 
they cannot reproduce sounds which they have never 
heard. The notion of rhythm as an essential part of 
language foundation may be explained to my readers 
at another time; it suffices to say here that the child 
himself shows us that this foundation should be laid 
during babyhood. At three or earlier he responds to 
strongly accented poetry and keeps perfect time in 
dancing, which is natural enough, considering that 
so much of life—for instance, heartbeats, walking, 
breathing, physical labor—is rhythmical. Rhythm 
awakens the emotions so that they respond to sugges- 
tion, and the power of many biblical passages is prob- 
ably due to their rhythm. Think of what ten years’ 
training in hearing and reproducing sounds would do 
in the way of sharpening the mind! 
Looking at things does not always signify seeing 
them. Many people go through life without a clear 
idea of the simplest subjects, unable to reason clearly 
because they lack the definite knowledge of particular
-P-A-G-E-94
  86° Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
things in the concrete on which reasoning must be 
based. Knowledge is based on something that precedes 
knowledge and depends upon the clearness and com- 
pleteness of our impressions. Since the mind obtains 
its information solely through the gateways of the 
senses, it is obvious that understanding and judgment 
will be in direct ratio to the perceptions received, just 
as the fairness of a court’s judgment depends upon the 
faithful presentation of the evidence. On the other 
hand, no one is ignorant, even though unschooled, 
whose senses are trained to gather exact impressions 
from his surroundings. The reader has doubtless 
learned through agreeable experience that the company 
of an observant person is an education in itself. 
In most cases stupidity in grown people, like back- 
wardness in children, is merely the outcome of failure 
to observe intelligently. A story is told of a pearl- 
merchant who spent his life in travel, yet never saw 
anything of interest, who, when asked something 
about Australia, where he had spent six months, ex- 
claimed: “Guess, now, what potatoes cost in Mel- 
bourne!” Every day furnishes proof that dullness, 
stupidity, “thick-headedness’—terms so often used to 
explain failure in making a living or planning a life 
—are rarely due to any lack of natural gifts, but are 
simply the penalty paid by the mind for the cheating 
of the senses. 
Sense training opens the gates of the mind, sharpens 
the desire for knowledge, and leads to the love of good 
books. If this were accomplished it would scarcely 
be necessary to instruct the young learner even in the 
elements of reading, so well-equipped would he be to 
continue his education by his own efforts. No one will

question that observation lessons are the solid and safe 
foundation for all scientific study, stepping-stones to 
success in nearly every human pursuit. High intel- 
lectual development is useless in such a profession as 
medicine or surgery or teaching if the senses have not 
been adequately developed. Not only the poet, the 
naturalist, the artist, depend upon observation for suc- 
cess, but so also do the farmer, the preacher, the mathe- 
matician, while Shakespeare’s fidelity to Nature has 
made him immortal. 
Two years ago Paul, who lives in Minneapolis, and 
is not yet seven years old, wanted “lessons,” so his 
parents led him to observe the birds that visited their 
yard, and after a time he began to draw them. He 
would come in and draw on the board in colored chalk 
the bird as he saw it, so that someone might recognize 
it and tell him its name. From week to week he 
became more proficient, and when I showed his recent 
drawing of a bluejay to an artist, she exclaimed in 
wonder and expressed the conviction that this boy has 
every prospect of becoming the great interpreter of 
bird life who has yet to make his appearance in 
America. “His outline is a truly remarkable piece of 
work,” she said. “The Japanese insist that to control 
the outline is the severest test of the artist.” Now he 
. may never become an artist, but his practice in making 
hand and eye work together has already opened up for 
him the prospect of a wide field from which to choose 
his life-work. 
Circumstances formerly compelled men to observe, 
for their very lives, not to mention their success in 
life, depended on the keenness of their senses. Clocks 
now take the place of sundial and noonmark, weather-
-P-A-G-E-96
  
  88  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
bureau forecasts are relied upon instead of noting 
wind, clouds, and temperature, while brick walls and 
paving stones still further contract our horizon. The 
man from the city had this brought home to him when 
he heard his hostess say to her son: 
“Go out and kill a hen for to-morrow’s dinner, and 
be sure to get one that isn’t laying.” 
“But how can I tell that in the dark, when I can’t see 
their combs?” queried the boy. 
“Take one that is perched farthest from the 
rooster,” replied the mother. “He always keeps the 
laying hens near himself.” 
As mere information the foregoing is worth little, 
but as an indication of an observant mind it gives us 
food for thought. Even if our visible needs seem less 
dependent now than formerly on the keenness of our 
perceptions, the difference is only in the seeming. 
Every single phase of living, of thinking, of social 
relationships, of civic and national welfare, depends 
upon our powers of accurate observation. One pri- 
mary purpose of sense training should be to cultivate 
keen interest in things of real importance. 
There never was a time when people did less think- 
ing than now. The head of the literary department in 
one of our great universities said not long ago that if 
the present craze for reading cheap, trivial stuff was 
not halted, there would soon be no one left in this 
country who could do real thinking. He added that 
this generation does more reading than any other in 
the world’s history, and has more trivial interests than 
any other of which we have any record. 
With Americans the power of the imagination is 
distinctly on the wane, which means, unhappily, not

only the loss of the power to construct or to enjoy a 
work of art, but the loss of our former ingenuity and 
dexterity in adapting things of the natural world to 
our own uses. This deterioration began, I should say, 
about the time that the careful grading of our schools 
made itself generally felt, for with the introduction of 
exact grading there naturally came a still greater em- 
phasis on knowledge of the kind that can be readily 
measured and marked in percentages. Therefore, 
what is called the best school, on account of its con- 
formity to a standardized system, is often the worst. 
Visit a carefully graded school and hear the recita- 
tions go with pell-mell rush. The quantity of informa- 
tion is torrential, but the quality is apparently a matter 
of no moment, while the only object seems to be to fit 
the pupil to the Procrustean bed of a prescribed 
program. The results are fatty degeneration of brain- 
cells, sclerosis of understanding, strangulation of in- 
terest, and a certifying diploma. 
I went one morning by invitation of the superinten- 
dent to a wonderfully graded school in the finest 
building of the city, in order to watch his prize teacher 
at work in a sixth grade. The first period, called 
geography, took the class through Ireland, from Cork 
due northwest. No facts, great or near-great or totally 
immaterial, were omitted that the writer of a popular 
supplementary textbook had seen fit to record at a time 
when print-paper was more abundant than now. 
“Over hill, over dale, 
Over park, over pale, 
Through flood, through fire.” 
But no mischievous fairy led the children this dance.
-P-A-G-E-98
  90 ~=— Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
The teacher had never seen fairies. A single glance 
told you that she came from that part of New Eng- 
land whence Cotton Mather had exorcised all such 
unsubstantial beings, but that, if fairies had been pre- 
scribed in the curriculum, she would have made an 
honest effort to summon them forth for qualitative 
analysis. At any rate, it was not Puck or the Pied 
Piper who led these children over the hills and by the 
lakes and through the bogs of the green isle, it was 
a tired, unimaginative woman, determined to show 
her visitor an efficient method of reviewing and drill- 
ing, and who took Ireland not from choice but because 
Ireland happened to be on the face of the earth and 
“came next” in the syllabus. 
How the dry bones of the old earth rattled for 
forty minutes! The skeleton of a lesson was there, 
indeed, but divested as it was of all human qualities, 
there was neither truth nor nature. True, the city of 
Cork is situated on a harbor, the harbor affords dock- 
age for vessels pausing on their trip between America 
and England, the population is so many thousands, 
the industries are such and such, peat is a popular fuel 
there and thereabouts, peat is cut out of the ground 
and dried. But if you dry that peat, Miss Simpson, 
for a thousand years, it can never be as dry as that les- 
son of yours on drying peat. The lesson finally ended, 
and it had been so exactly timed that the end of the 
period, the end of the review, and the arrival at Done- 
gal were simultaneous. Its perfection reminded one 
of a jubilant typesetter who rushed into the editorial 
office, proof sheets of a magazine story in hand, ex- 
claiming: “This is the best article we have had this 
year. There was exactly the right number of words
-P-A-G-E-99
  Training Children to Observe gi 
to make it end exactly at the bottom of the page.” 
Forty-odd pupils now put away their geographies 
and plainly resigned themselves to a review of history. 
On went the teacher, almost as if no change of thought 
had occurred, chanting her chronological litany in a 
high nasal monotone, fearfully rasping to human 
nerves. Walking, talking, wielding a five-foot wooden 
pointer, she passed with ungainly strides from desk to 
map and from map to chart. At first she marshaled 
facts into the young minds as Noah filled his house- 
boat, in ordered ranks, by two and two, but soon the 
pace was accelerated and facts came trooping by tens 
and dozens. For forty-odd minutes that woman went 
careering through time and space, steadily emitting the 
most bewildering array of facts, unrelated, as far as 
her pupils could see, as to time or place or sequence 
or dependence. The earth was hers and the fullness 
thereof. From Father Abraham to Papa Joffre, from 
Beersheba to Verdun, from Mephistopheles to the 
Kaiser, she swept that helpless group of children. To 
be exact, she reviewed them from page seven to the 
mathematical center of the book, with an occasional 
side-glance at current events and some profound oracu- 
lar dicta concerning the League of Nations. 
When a pause finally came I said to her somewhat as 
follows: “What are you doing to cultivate an apprecia- 
tion of the wonders of Creation? How are you using 
that appreciation to develop in these boys and girls a 
strong individuality, an individuality that has the 
strength to subordinate its interests to those of the 
family, the nation, and mankind, and to submit humbly 
to the will of God?” 
She told me that there was nothing like that in the
-P-A-G-E-100
  92  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
course of study and asked me if I would mind telling 
her just what I meant. I answered her question by 
asking the class how many of them knew that the 
stars rise and set. None of them had ever heard of 
such a thing. Then, in language as simple as possible, 
I undertook to give them some conception of the mar- 
velous works of the Creator; of the thousands of suns 
ranged all around us at immense distances from each 
other; attended by ten thousand times ten thousand 
worlds, all in rapid motion, yet calm, regular and 
harmonious, invariably keeping the paths prescribed 
to them; and these worlds possibly peopled with 
millions of beings, formed for endless progression 
towards perfection and happiness. 
Of course the children were not prepared to grasp 
more than a tiny fraction of what these words would 
convey to hearers differently trained, but they did 
gather enough of my meaning to ask the question I 
had hoped for: “What keeps the suns and worlds 
from falling?” In my answer I sought to lure them 
on to further inquiry by telling them that their 
teacher would explain about the force which deter- 
mines the fall of a stone, and that this same force 
is the ruling principle in the heavenly motions and 
is the means by which these vast bodies are suspended 
in the immensity of space. 
When the superintendent asked me what I thought 
of Miss Simpson, I remarked feebly that she seemed 
to be a frightful worker. ‘‘She is, indeed,” he ex- 
claimed with warmth, not heeding the equivocal 
phrase in which I had shamelessly taken refuge. “If 
we had more teachers like her, what couldn’t we do 
with the children!”
-P-A-G-E-101
  Training Children to Observe 93 
“What couldn’t you do, indeed?” I mused. It 
made me think of a friend of mine who owns a beau- 
tiful estate on which a king’s ransom has been lav- 
ished in tree-planting and landscape gardening, but 
who is forever pining for a brook. “If I only had a 
brook, just think what I could do with it!’ And she 
says every word in capital letters. Many times I tried 
to think what anyone would do with a brook, except 
let it,run, and at last I said to her cousin: “If Mrs. 
Beauregard-Smith had a brook, what would she do 
with it?” “If Mrs. Beauregard-Smith had a brook,” 
came the energetic reply, “she would get cement and 
make a canal of it.” 
In this world of sorrowful blundering perhaps 
parents and school teachers should not be too harshly 
criticized for acting on the assumption that the educa- 
tional process consists mainly in charging the young 
mind with neat little, dry little, clean little missiles of 
information and rattling them round at stated inter- 
vals, to make certain they are still in place and ready 
for the popgun, but does it not seem to you, mothers, 
that the “men higher up” might do something to 
abolish such teaching in favor of a system of mind 
training? That observation, comparison, discrimina- 
tion are indispensable steps towards sound learning is 
not a recent discovery. That overlaying the mind 
with thicknesses of secondrate facts impedes its 
working and stunts its growth was probably recog- 
nized as long ago as the time of Rameses II. Yet, 
while awaiting still another “wonderful new method,” 
the greater part of our school curriculum continues 
to be merely informational. 
It is so easy to impart information, easy for the 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  94  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
teacher to say, learn so many pages, easy to have 
showy recitations of facts that pass for learning, 
easy to examine pupils on the quantity remaining sus- 
pended in the memory, easy to grade answers. For 
modern youngsters there is no tedious climbing of 
the hill of knowledge, for an escalator takes them 
from kindergarten to high school graduation with- 
out their ever knowing the joy of honest, sustained 
effort, and when the fair girl graduate stands on the 
platform reading her essay, “The Diary of Dido,” 
the high school principal says confidentially to his little 
group of auditors: “Just see what we have done for 
that girl. We took her, a simple farmer’s daughter, 
and now see what she is!’ Again we see with painful 
clearness. She is a girl who has cribbed a jumble of 
immoral details from library books, interspersed them 
with high school slang, and then, though quite old 
enough to know better, has the shamelessness to read 
this mess aloud to a mixed audience. 
However, if the home does its part, there is little 
need for worry over the neglect of observational 
training in the schools, for no home is so poorly cir- 
cumstanced that it cannot give the groundwork for 
scientific instruction. Its very imperfections and 
apparent drawbacks can be made to do their part in 
developing mental activity, reflection, dexterity, and 
inventiveness. There is no such laboratory in any 
school as the home kitchen, cellar, or yard. Must a 
boy wait for high school to see and learn that a piece 
of iron left exposed to damp air is after awhile con- 
verted to a reddish brittle substance? How much 
research on the parents’ part will it take to explain 
that rust comes from the union of iron with the oxy-
-P-A-G-E-103
  Training Children to Observe 95 
gen from the air? Must children wait for school 
days to observe falling raindrops, rising steam, to 
learn that one is heavier, one lighter, than air, that 
the water in the bathtub is hotter on the surface than 
at the bottom, that like heated water, heated air rises, 
and cold air rushes in to take its place, and so be led 
from this knowledge to understand the causes of 
winds on the earth’s surface? 
In no school can the children get the training for 
the study of mathematics that the everyday home 
affords. The child who gets his first arithmetic les- 
sons in the kitchen, seeing for himself, through pe 
and hand, that one plate and one plate are two plates, 
that a quart is more than a pint and a pint less than a 
quart, that the cat has more feet than he, and that he 
has fewer feet than the cat, is learning arithmetic in 
the correct way. School lessons in number, unless 
based on long and careful training in observation, not 
only do not implant mathematical ability, but by con- 
fusing the child mind, destroy what would be other- 
wise, in a greater or lesser degree, a natural aptitude 
for numbers. 
Must the children of my teacher-mothers go to 
school to learn the seasons, the points of the compass, 
the rising and setting of sun, moon, and stars, the 
three great kingdoms of the physical world? To 
learn to read thermometer, barometer, weather-vane, 
the sky and its portents? To learn that nothing in the 
natural world is too simple, too lowly, too ugly, too 
common to be a part of education? 
When it comes to giving the child healthy interests, 
which are so much more potent against evil than bare 
instruction can ever be—for knowledge alone is a
-P-A-G-E-104
  96 = Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
mighty poor safeguard against wrongdoing—what 
part of the school equipment can develop the mind and 
heart like a pet at home, whether it be a cat, a dog, a 
calf, a bird, or, most wonderful in all the world, a 
baby? 
That is a great moment in the small girl’s life when 
she first finds a nestful of warm white eggs in the hay- 
mow. How did they come there? She has seen eggs 
before, and has been told that the hen laid eggs, but 
never did this explanation mean anything until the 
wonderful nest lay before the young eyes. Then the 
questions: Did the hen lay them all at once? Why 
are they warm? Why did she come back here every 
day? Does she have more than one nest? All the 
nature study in the finest school could not bring home 
to this child the wonder, thrill, and delight of this dis- 
covery in the hay. 
“How can I teach my child to reason soundly?” 
By making him observant as a preliminary to explana- 
tion and reasoning. The only causes and reasons the 
young child can understand are those discernible to 
the senses, the abstract being beyond his comprehen- 
sion. All your finest explanations and illustrations 
will not make a child of seven or eight really under- 
stand the cause of day and night or of the change of 
seasons, but a little questioning will lead him to draw 
reasonable conclusions concerning things within his 
scope. For instance, the noisy Anglo-American spar- ‘ 
row stays with us who live in the cold north, while 
most other birds go south. Why? Because this bird 
can stand the cold better than the migratory birds that 
leave us in the winter. He can also find food, espe- 
cially in the towns and wherever there is grain to be
-P-A-G-E-105
Training Children to Observe 97 
found in winter, for he must have the grain. Other 
hardy birds that perhaps might manage with grain 
are not bold enough to make raids for it and take it 
away from the barnyard fowl or pick it up in the road- 
way, so that the sparrow’s tough little skin, his eating 
habits, and his daring, all account for his outstaying 
birds that are better-liked. 
One of the many good reasons for insisting upon 
regular work from children is that only through the 
hands can the child obtain the lessons most suitable to 
develop mentality, by learning through experience and 
experiment to reason from cause to effect and from 
effect back to cause. When he is made to perform 
intelligently various household tasks the child amasses, 
through the senses and sensations, an amazing quantity 
of knowledge which is indispensable to mental balance 
and judgment, knowledge that under modern condi- 
tions could not otherwise be gained naturally. 
The child who is too much absorbed in books slights 
the practical things of life. The mother must try to 
adjust this discordance and emphasize in every way 
the importance of the world which lies about him; she 
must train him to do and make things, to use hands and 
eyes. The simplest thing he is trained to make with his 
hands is worth more than any subsequent school lesson 
requiring equal time and teaching. Even when quite 
young he should learn to use tools, hoe, rake, spade, 
thereby acquiring the idea of via inertia, of the resist- 
ance of objects and materials to their use, of the resist- 
ance of matter to mind, and developing muscular sensa- 
tion. Helping you in the kitchen and watching you in 
the preparation of food will afford many fine lessons. 
When you are making cake, let the child try to tell you
-P-A-G-E-106
  98  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-M other 
what comes next, and how much; he can count the 
eggs, learn pint, quart, etc., but do not expect him to 
count beyond a number which he actually uses, and the 
counting should follow the measuring, not precede it. 
The child is not the only one to benefit by home 
lessons in observation, for the teacher-mother grows in 
wisdom from day to day, the whetting of mind on 
mind, even though it be the mind of a child, being an 
unsurpassed intellectual stimulus. It increases the 
ability to judge soundly and to deal wisely with facts, 
especially as they relate to the conduct of life, and 
cultivates common sense, and “common sense in an 
uncommon degree is what the world calls wisdom.” 
The child learns much from his mother, but the mother 
learns still more from her child, for by the time she has 
finished showing him an object from ten different 
angles she will realize that the only way to know a 
subject thoroughly is to teach it. She will also know 
more about her child than if she had left his instruc- 
tion to strangers. 
If my insistence on mind training fills the teacher- 
mother with foreboding, lest she lack the requisite skill 
and learning to accomplish such an assignment, let me 
show how simple the task is. For its effectiveness 
mind training depends primarily on sense training, and 
sense training deals particularly with what we may call 
the physical or animal aspects of development. Most 
fortunately, this training should begin in earliest in- 
fancy, else we neglect an entire psychological period, 
which is the period of greatest plasticity, of greatest 
response to suitable stimulus. For every observation 
lesson the mother teaches the child, the child teaches 
himself, and her, a score of lessons. The simple, joy-
-P-A-G-E-107
  
Training Children to Observe 99 
ful truth is that to develop and train the senses is to 
develop and train the mind. Now, where is the bug- 
bear? For the senses are simple and elemental. How 
to train them is within the learning of anyone able to 
read, and this done, our stupendous “mind training” 
will practically take care of itself. As for the requisite 
knowledge, the mother is fully equipped for all the 
teaching that should be given in the early years. 
Arouse a living interest in one flower, one star, one 
tree, one bird, one little wild beast, and Nature almost 
unaided will attend to the rest. 
The education of the senses should be based more 
on instinct, as it is done all through Nature, than on 
a systematic training. By this is meant that the good 
teacher is guided by Nature’s plan of letting the child 
attain a clear perception of external objects by experi- 
mentation, the mother of invention. Give ample time 
for the new idea to grow, tell the child of seven or 
eight that the moon travels around the earth, answer 
his questions, but otherwise leave him alone to puzzle 
this great new idea out, to follow the moon on its 
journey over sea and land, to wonder if it really can 
be true! Do not mention unnecessarily any other 
heavenly or earthly body until his questions show that 
for the time being his mind has freed itself from the 
moon. 
Foster inquisitiveness, and you will then have little 
cause to complain of idle curiosity. Teach your child 
to take an interest in things worth noticing, not in 
inconsequential things. A true artist admires the trees 
that he paints, more than his painting of them, however 
artistic it may be; therefore let things natural take 
precedence over things artificial. He cannot wholly 
LIBRARY

y 
  100 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
learn this lesson in childhood, but he can begin to 
learn it. Do not take for granted his understanding 
of any point. A child does not know a straight line 
until he is taught what it is. He will call a slanting 
straight line crooked, and a perfect circle he will call 
straight, meaning regular. 
Object lessons should be direct. Lessons about a 
tree should be learned from a tree, not from a book 
on trees; they can then be expanded and amplified by 
verbal explanations and reading. The first lessons 
should be as plain and simple as possible, and expanded 
gradually, the same object furnishing material for 
many lessons. A child cannot possibly learn all about 
any one object in one lesson and to gain a clear con- 
ception of it may take years. Systematic, progressive 
training in the use of the senses should continue from 
day to day, and from year to year, embracing many 
kinds of objects. 
If you want your children to be interested in nature, 
you must be interested yourself; therefore when Paul 
brings in a beetle do not squeak and shriek at him to 
take the nasty thing away, but proceed to get a lesson 
out of it. I do not insist that you are to fondle the 
insect, for, confidentially, I would not do so myself, 
but there is a better way. Instead of postponing until 
high school his lesson on the June bug, say to Paul: 
“Let us see how much we can find out about this beetle. 
How many legs has it? Is the body in one or two 
parts? What kind of eyes has it? Has it jaws, feel- 
ers, feet, tail, and sting, or none? How many wings 
has it? What is their color and shape; how are the 
wings folded when resting? Where is it found, and 
what is its food?” These are only suggestions which
-P-A-G-E-109
  Training Children to Observe 101 
you can expand, so that the child uses his senses and 
brain before he is given the result of someone else’s 
observations. 
For sense-training material use natural and artificial 
objects, animate and inanimate, taking them in an order 
that conforms to the child’s age and surroundings. 
In the morning ask yourself what part of the universe 
you will bring to his attention that day. Beginning 
with the baby, how much better it is to have his nap 
outdoors, weather permitting, so that his waking mo- 
ments may be filled with the sight of swaying trees or 
fleeting clouds, than to leave him to stare at dull walls. 
Protect his eyes from strong light and give him the 
environment of Nature whenever you can. . 
Material for lessons should be found and supplied, 
as far as possible, by the pupil himself. During the 
early years objects manufactured for this purpose 
should be avoided as harmful. We must learn to use 
our senses rather than father’s pocketbook in getting 
the best from our surroundings, therefore substitute 
outdoor natural material for pseudo-educational gim- 
cracks. Do not, if you can help it, use anything that 
costs money during the kindergarten period except the 
blackboard and chalk, and perhaps a writing or draw- 
ing book for each child for rainy days. This is not 
for economy’s sake, though indirectly it teaches the 
habit of economy, but to make the most of homely 
and familiar surroundings and to follow as nearly as 
we can the path trodden by worth-while men and 
women, whose noble and helpful lives have proved that 
it was the right path. “The old ways are best.” For 
example, the value of wooden alphabet blocks is not 
great. Of course you can make use of them in invented
-P-A-G-E-110
  102 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
lessons, teaching the child something about compara- 
tive sizes, edges, rough and smooth, light and heavy, 
and so on, but these lessons can be taught far better 
with materials collected at will, such as sticks and 
stones, earth, plants, a pail of water, an egg, dishes, 
hose, pets, whatever happens to lie at hand. The very 
best objects are those which are so familiar to us 
grown-ups that they are deadly commonplace and 
therefore often overlooked. 
Nothing is too simple, too lowly, too common to be 
worth while from this viewpoint of helping the child 
to find his rightful place in relation to his surround- 
ings. Let us not ignore even the chickens’ tracks in 
the mud, or whether the cow’s two horns are exactly 
alike. Your back yard is so full of nature study that 
Tam only carrying owls to Athens in mentioning more. 
Set your boy to notice things and, as you will see, he 
will soon teach himself. Make use of natural play- 
things. Especially during the first three years, and as 
far as is practicable and reasonable during the first 
seven years, supply as playthings suitable objects in 
their natural state from the three great kingdoms. In 
this way, through the medium of the senses, rather 
than through words, and at the right period, the child 
comes into close contact with his natural surroundings. 
Baby intelligence is safely developed. An ordinary 
round stone is a better plaything than a china door- 
knob; a potato is better than a rubber ball; a stick of 
kindling or hardwood has advantages as building ma- 
terial over the nicely planed block. Each of the natural 
objects has distinctive characteristics which, apart 
from their value as observational material, does not 
lessen their value as playthings, which is now really
-P-A-G-E-111
  Training Children to Observe 103 
the first consideration. Water, sand, mud, pebbles, 
stones, sticks, nuts, walnut shells for boats, beans, peas, 
soaked grains of corn or allspice for beads; potatoes, 
apples, pumpkin, gourd, large leaves for lunch cloth, 
small leaves for napkins and doilies, cat, dog. These 
and various combinations of them, with others that lie 
at hand everywhere, will keep a young child happy and 
good and busily learning.

CHAPTER VII 
OPENING THE MIND’S GATEWAYS 
Some kind of object lesson, not necessarily a set one, 
should be given every day. A croaking frog, a smok- 
ing stove, a broken dish, a decayed apple, the cat’s 
toes, anything and everything noticeable by the senses 
should be seized upon when it presents itself. I am 
sure that not one of my teacher-mothers will take the 
stand of the over-methodical kindergartner, to whom I 
presented some cocoons from which the tenants were 
about to emerge, and who protested that since it was 
January she could not allow her little charges to wit- 
ness the approaching miracle because, according to her 
set of four kindergarten books, grubs are not supposed 
to matriculate into butterfly citizenship in that month. 
Too full for words, I carried my caterpillars back to 
their terrarium, sought out another kindergarten 
teacher and demanded her sympathy in my pain of 
mind. She gave it, but added that the kindergartner 
was right, because there is a little butterfly song that 
goes with seeing the butterflies come out, and as this 
is to be sung in April, it would hardly do to sing it in 
January. 
The time to teach an object lesson is when a suitable 
object presents itself, and the choice of it should by no 
means be limited to such lessons as may be suggested 
in this book, which is an unsystematized talk on things 
just off the beaten highway of familiar instruction, I 
104
-P-A-G-E-113
Opening the Mind’s Gateways 105 
purposely omit the type of lessons that get themselves 
taught somehow, the kind suggested by kindergarten 
courses. 
Certain old aristocratic families were proud of their 
sensitive and discriminatory noses. Besides educating 
an important sense, smell training should be given 
every day for its practical use, for a fastidious nose is 
a better safeguard than a fastidious palate. It is rea- 
sonable to suppose that a well-developed sense of smell 
has protected many people from the danger of catching 
certain infectious diseases or partaking of poisonous 
food. The indiscriminate use of perfumes spoils the 
sense of smell. Smelling experiments involve not the 
slightest risk of overtaxing the nervous system. Teach 
your children to know by smell everything on your 
premises that is smellable. Soap, oil, butter, vinegar, 
molasses, pepper; ink, vegetables, fruit, flowers, weeds, 
turpentine, camphor, axle-grease; the odor of cows, 
of horses, of sheep—all will help to train the sense of 
smell. Even the baby should be taught to smell flow- 
ers and other objects, so that he soon learns to ask for 
the privilege. His “’mell, ’mell,” should not be 
ignored. 
Teach the child through his hands and through all 
the senses, to know the common elemental things. For 
the three-year-old, plan lessons to train the sense of 
feeling. For instance, place on the table a number of 
familiar objects, such as balls, buttons, nuts; blindfold 
Robert, let him pick them up one by one and identify 
them by fingering them, naming each and describing 
it as well as he can. Teach him to detect blindfold the 
differences between cloths, leaves, papers, coins, seeds. 
For lessons in “rough and smooth,” use all available 
 
-P-A-G-E-114
  106 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
appropriate objects, such as rasp, nail-file, potato, 
apple, walnut, hazelnut, rough and smooth paper, etc. 
Teach hot, cold, hard, soft, dry, moist, through the 
fingertips. 
Muscular sensation is one of the divisions of the 
sense of feeling, and to be able to estimate the weight 
of an object to a pound, or even an ounce, is not a use- 
less accomplishment, but helps in developing the ability 
to judge of practical matters. With practice and per- 
severance it can be acquired by anybody. Plan lessons 
that train your children to judge of differences in 
weight. Let the small boy collect a pile of stones; tell 
him to put the heavy ones in one pile and the light ones 
in another. After a time, a year or so, have him make 
three piles, the third for intermediate weights. 
For these lessons take flatirons, sticks of wood, etc., 
anything the children can handle. Take a brick as a 
standard of weight. Let them tell which is the heavier, 
which the lighter; thus you teach them the correct use 
of such words. At first there should be a great differ- 
ence in weight, but as the weeks go by the contrast 
should be lessened. After a while, introduce three 
objects for comparison of weights, teaching lighter and 
lightest, heavier and heaviest. You can expand such 
lessons indefinitely. 
For a child of five it is a good plan to take an object 
weighing just a pound—a box of baking soda is con- 
venient, or fill a bag with sand to the weight of one 
pound. A year or so later, use a half-pound weight. 
Make him use this as a standard of comparison, hav- 
ing him “heft” other objects and estimate whether 
they weigh more or less than one pound. By laying 
the object afterwards on the pan of the scales, he can
-P-A-G-E-115
  Opening the Mind’s Gateways 107 
find out for himself whether he estimated correctly or 
not. An old-fashioned balance with two pans will 
serve better for this purpose, as its construction and 
operation are so very simple that very little explana- 
tion is required. If you have not got one, try with 
Paul’s help to make one. All you need is a strip of 
wood with a hole in the midpoint for beam, paper 
plates for scale pans, a piece of string, and a piece of 
wire for handle and for suspending balance. You can 
easily adjust it so as to balance fairly correctly, and 
what a rich mine of physical information you have 
opened up for your children! These are fine games to 
play with father or mother on winter evenings, one 
contestant after another giving the estimate, the win- 
ner being finally determined by the corrections. At 
first the children will not be very close in their esti- 
mates, but practice should make them little experts. 
Ear-training by piano or other musical instrument, 
the human voice, animal calls and cries, bird-notes, 
should be practiced every day. Get Eloise to imitate 
the noises of little pigs, big pigs, chickens, mother 
hen, rooster, other farm creatures, wild creatures, spar- 
row, robin, jay, crow, brook, engine. Whether she 
succeeds very well does not matter; it is the attempt 
and continued effort that count. But make certain 
that the practice of mimicking does not transgress the 
bounds of good breeding. It is unwise to encourage 
any mimicry of human beings, the habit being too 
easily acquired. 
Children between four and seven should make the 
acquaintance of angleworms, spiders, grasshoppers, 
fireflies. Look for a flat stone on the ground, turn 
it up and show Charles the little live things scampering 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
  108 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
away into the friendly darkness. Disturb an ant-hill 
and watch the nurses running away to new quarters 
with their precious babies. Find eggs of toads and 
frogs in the pools, if you have such. Bring in polli- 
wogs, keep them in a glass jar and change the water 
frequently for fresh pond water, so that they can get 
food from its slimy little plants. Watch the legs 
appear, the tail drop off, and other changes. Teach 
the meaning of pond, brook, stream and bridge if you 
can, by artificial ponds, brooks, streams, bridges, de- 
vised with the child’s help. It is not alone the accumu- 
lation of interesting and valuable facts that makes such 
lessons important, but the acquiring of a permanent 
interest that may easily be a safeguard throughout tem- 
pestuous years, during which the mind tends to become 
centered on self. 
An excellent little chapter in a course of observation 
lessons for Eleanor may center about her pet lamb, or 
any other pet. She should count its eyes, ears, tail, 
the toes on one foot. She should learn the names and 
meanings of wool, fur, hoof, paw, toe, nail, claw. In 
like manner teach the names of the more important 
parts of a dog’s body, as legs, toes, foot, ears, eyes, 
mouth, teeth, tongue, nose, muzzle, hair, tail, back, 
ribs, side, flank. Let her find out for herself how many 
toes the dog has on each foot. How few of us are 
aware that there are commonly only four toes on each 
of the hind feet. On the fore feet, she will find the 
fifth toe apart from the others and a little higher up. 
Examine the nails. What color are they? What color 
is the inside of the dog’s mouth? Teach the names of 
the various parts of the body of chickens, as leg, toe, 
feathers, wings, tail, beak, eye, comb, back, neck, crop, 
*
-P-A-G-E-117
  
Opening the Mind’s Gateways 109 
gizzard—not only as names but with correct meanings 
as far as the child can understand them. One form of 
observation that may be practiced season after season 
and year after year is the examination and comparison 
of tracks of chicken, cow, pig, and child, and of the 
feet that made them. Send her to look at the foot of 
cow, horse, dog, or cat and then come and describe 
it to you. 
Especially from the age of five onward, birds are 
good and suitable objects for lessons in observation 
and general knowledge, ranking, perhaps, before flow- 
ers, for as they exhibit life more strikingly than do 
flowers, they attract the child more and rouse his imag- 
ination more directly and naturally. What birds are 
now visiting your yard? What food is the sparrow 
after? Describe it with your eyes shut. Compare 
and contrast other birds with the sparrow as to size, 
color, shape, flight, gait on ground, habits, food, 
friends, numbers. What bird hops, runs, walks in a 
stately manner? ‘Try to find a robin’s nest with the 
young birds stretching out their wide yellow beaks for 
a nice fat worm as the old birds bring food. 
Coax the birds to stay through the winter by putting 
out food for them—crumbs, seed, grain, popcorn. Try 
tacking suet to the trees, with the inverted rim of an 
old pan underneath or with some other contrivance to 
prevent the cats from getting the coveted suet. The 
sparrows probably will not attack it, but other birds 
will in all likelihood come to the feast. Now, if the 
birds accept your invitation to stay with you in winter, 
be sure not to cut off their food supply during the bad 
weather. 
In winter plant a few peas or beans in a can of soil,
-P-A-G-E-118
  110 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
or better, make Helen do it, and make her weed and 
water the Lilliputian garden, watching the sprouts 
from day to day, so that she will get an idea of how 
things grow. Plant a few seeds of some quickly 
sprouting plant, later a slow sprouting plant, that she 
should watch for changes. This will prepare her for 
the summer lessons. Have you bulbs for winter bloom- 
ing? Tulips and narcissuses are such a joy. Plant 
them each fall according to directions in earth in the 
cellar, bringing up one or more from time to time, 
after they have rooted, and gradually introducing them 
to sunshine and warmth. The children can water them 
under direction, measure growth, watch development, 
smell and admire to their heart’s content. Bring in 
bud-covered branches of fruit-trees in earliest spring 
so that the child can observe them bloom and leave. 
Do likewise with pussy-willow, and after they have 
done blooming set them out in the ground, where they 
usually thrive and grow. 
Make snow the subject of a lesson. Melt it on the 
stove, to show that it becomes water, then pour the 
water through a strainer to show that the water can 
also become rain. If the holes of the strainer are too 
large, put blotting paper on the bottom so that the 
water will run slowly through, drop by drop. 
Children of five or six should learn to know the 
various vegetables, observing and comparing leaves, 
stems, roots, etc. Teach them also to recognize and 
name each of the trees on or near your premises, but 
do not expect such young children to notice very much 
of their differences. This must come gradually. Make 
them notice first the common characteristics and thus 
get a correct mental picture of a tree. Teach them to
-P-A-G-E-119
  Opening the Mind’s Gateways IIr 
know the flowers by blossom, odor, leaf. Play games, 
such as showing the child a leaf from a certain plant 
and sending him to find that plant. By pulling off a 
branch or twig, show Margaret the horseshoe-shaped 
scar whence the horsechestnut is said to get its name. 
Quicken the mind of a five-year-old by such exer- 
cises as this: “Eddie, let us pretend that I do not know 
a radish when I see it. Tell me where to find a bed of 
them and describe the radish to me so that I shall know 
it is a radish.” Then, using the proper terms, such as 
right or left, etc., he will tell you the way to take 
through the house and direct you to the right place in 
the garden, explain to you what the leaves look like, 
how close the plants grow to each other, etc. Fre- 
quent practice of this kind makes him think before he 
speaks, and obliges him to use accurate language. 
The child of six or thereabouts should measure with 
units which are not standardized; for instance, find 
how many pencil-lengths this table is, in length and 
width; how many cubits (elbow to tip of middle 
finger) ; how many book-lengths. Do not explain that 
such measuring is valueless because the chosen unit 
is not generally accepted, until the child indicates that 
he is ready for the necessary explanation; that is, until 
he realizes that something more suitable is needed. It 
does not matter if it be two years hence before he 
wakes up to this thought; if given too soon it is a mere 
fact and of no educational value, but given at the right 
time it is a necessary and important step forward in 
education. Another way of training the eye is by 
taking a yardstick as a standard, and estimating com- 
parative lengths and heights. Is the yardstick longer 
or shorter than the table, rug, dog, width of door or  
-P-A-G-E-120
‘ 112 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
window, stove, etc.? Several children can take part in 
these lessons. Considerably later use the foot as a unit, 
and later still, the inch. 
Give lessons that combine training of hand and eye. 
Make the child fill a pail or other vessel with water 
or sand by the cupful, teach her to estimate whether 
the vessel will hold another cupful, make her empty 
the contents by cupfuls, taking out a full cup each 
time, watching how the contents get less and approach 
the bottom of the vessel, and judging whether there is 
another cupful left. These are important tasks, pre- 
liminary to arithmetic lessons. The measuring steadies 
\the mind and trains it in judgment. Such lessons are 
not for one year only, but are to be repeated year after 
year with such variations, extensions, and amplifica- 
tions as you can devise. 
Teach the child the name of the thermometer, the 
scale, the glass tube and bulb, the mercury, the main 
purpose in this being to familiarize him with his imme- 
diate surroundings, to habituate him to learn the 
names of familiar objects. Very little information 
concerning the thermometer or mercury will be intelli- 
gible to a child of seven, but show him if possible how 
quickly it seems to run about on a slightly slanting 
surface. After he has gained an idea of the weight 
of mercury as compared with that of other common 
substances, ask him if he would be likely to go down 
in a lake of quicksilver or mercury. 
On clear nights, especially in “the dark of the moon,” 
point out a few of the most conspicuous constellations, 
as the Great Dipper, Orion, Cassiopeia’s Chair, Leo 
with Regulus, Andromeda. If you have forgotten 
what you once knew about them, get a book on popu- 
  \
-P-A-G-E-121
  Opening the Mind’s Gateways 113 
lar astronomy, which contains also the myths referring 
to these constellations. Watch the same bright star 
night after night. When it disappears from the eve- 
ning sky like the sun, it has set, to rise again. Teach 
the cardinal points of the compass so that the child will 
know from which window to look to see east, west, 
north, south. 
Watch for the new moon. Note the part of the sky 
in which you first see it, whether it is nearer the hori- 
zon or the zenith, ask the child which half of the disk, 
the right or left, is visible, whether her horns point 
right or left, east or west. From day to day note its 
apparent change of illumination and position, until 
the waning moon is seen. Which half of the disk is 
now visible? Do her horns point right or left, east 
or west? Show the children the phenomenon desig- 
nated in Scotland as “the new moon with the old moon 
in her arms.” Lead them to see that the new moon 
rises about the same time as the sun and sets with him; 
that the full moon rises about sunset and sets about 
sunrise. 
Make gardening the backbone of the summer’s 
instruction, even if your garden be only a few square 
feet of earth. If the child works with you each day 
at weeding and cultivating, asking questions suggested 
by those operations, and having her attention directed 
to all natural and artificial things with which she comes 
in contact, she will get exactly what she needs of nature 
study, combined with essential habit-training. Watch 
for each dear little green plant that puts its head above 
ground; for unfolding leaves and for the insects that 
visit the plant. Point out and explain to her the dis- 
tinguishing characteristics of weeds and vegetables.
-P-A-G-E-122
114 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
When she has learned to discriminate between them, 
make her pull weeds for a short period each day when- 
ever this is practicable. Do not leave this to her 
choice, do not let her pull a weed here and a weed 
there, but mark off clearly each day a little space which 
she is to clear of weeds. Interest her in the various 
creatures that turn up in the garden—beetle, cutworm, 
angleworm, ant, spider, grasshopper, fly, butterfly, 
moth, toad, mole, newt, snake. Teach her not only to 
recognize each but to know, as far as possible, where 
each one lives, whether underground, on the ground, 
or above her head. Let her find this out as each one 
scurries for safety after being forced from its tempo- 
rary hiding place or permanent abode under the weeds. 
In this way you are combining lessons in observation, 
regularity, and useful activity. 
Then, when there is spare time indoors, you could 
look up pictures or descriptions of these things, so that 
the child would gain two kinds of information, empiri- 
cal, through direct practical experience; theoretical, 
through books and illustrations. I should recommend 
farming, before any other industry, for the children’s 
instruction. Through it a sound, wholesome, perfect 
education can be obtained, that beautiful, harmonious, 
and humane education which does not depend on books 
and schooling as indispensable essentials, but values 
highly good books and suitable schooling as powerful 
and beneficent aids. 
Now, perhaps, after this rambling talk, we may 
formulate a few rules for sense-training: (1) Observe 
the object by as many of the five senses as may be 
practicable. (2) Find its name. (3) Let the child 
give his own description of the object in answer to
-P-A-G-E-123
  Opening the Mind’s Gateways 115 
simple, suitable and carefully-graded questions. (4) 
Lead the child by questioning to compare the object of 
the lesson with more familiar objects. (5) Give the 
child suitable additional information, based on the 
information gathered. (6) Teach him a suitable 
proverb, maxim, or a passage from a poem illustrating 
the thoughts or discoveries of others in relation to the 
object; read an appropriate story or help the child to 
find such reading. 
In the first year of instruction, when the child is 
about three, he should learn to distinguish a tree from 
other objects; to see the difference between trunk, 
branches, and leaves. 
Ask such questions as: Which is larger, the trunk 
or the branch? The branch or the leaf? 
“Show me a long branch.” “Here is a long branch.” 
“Show me a short branch.” “Here is a short 
branch.” 
Say to the child: “Rub your hand on the bark of 
that tree (oak or maple or apple-tree). Now, that 
bark is rough.” 
“Rub your hand on the skin of mother’s face. That 
is not rough. It is smooth.” 
Let the child pull a leaf through its fingers. “Is one 
side of the leaf rougher than the other side?” ‘Which 
is smoother, the upper or the lower side?” “Which 
side is shiny?” ‘Which side is not so bright or shiny?” 
Ans. “The lower side is not shiny. It is dull.” 
“Has the leaf a stalk?” “Is the stalk shorter or 
longer than the leaf?” “Find another leaf.” ‘“Crum- 
ple it in your fingers.” “Does it feel dry or moist?” 
Put one leaf on top of another to compare the sizes. 
“Which leaf is larger?” ‘Which is smaller?”
-P-A-G-E-124
116 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
Tell the child to gather leaves, then to put the large 
ones in one pile and the small ones in another. 
“How many piles have you?” “I have two piles.” 
“Tn which pile are more leaves?” “There are more 
leaves in this pile.” 
Call the child’s attention to the rustling and stirring 
of the leaves in the wind, and to the dry leaves blown 
about. ‘“‘They have left their safe homes. That is 
why they are blown about.” 
Such lines as the following are suitable for memo- 
rizing : 
“Come, little leaves,’ said the wind one day, 
‘Come to the meadows with me to play.’” 
Dress the child so that its dress does not interfere 
with such outdoor lessons. 
Repeat day after day such lessons, always varying 
the point of view. It takes a child a long, long time, 
for instance, to distinguish between leaf and twig, twig 
and branch, branch and trunk, and to visualize each 
in the moment it hears the word. 
SECOND YEAR 
Review the lessons of the preceding year, always 
amplifying and expanding them. Follow the same 
method. 
Additional Lessons: 
Teach the child to measure with eye, hand, and 
foot. 
“Can you reach around the tree? Try it. If not, 
why not?” 
“Because my arms are not long enough to reach 
round it.”
-P-A-G-E-125
  Opening the Mind’s Gateways 117 
“Can mother reach round it?” “Why?” “Because 
her arms are longer.” 
You can find a thousand variations of such ques- 
tions. 
“Can you reach the lowest branches? Try it. Why 
not?” 
“Because I am not tall enough.” 
“Can father reach them?” “Why?” “Because he is 
taller than I.” 
“How many times taller?” “Twice as tall.” 
“Which is lower, the trunk or the branches?” 
“Which is higher, the trunk or the branches?” 
“Stand here. Can you touch the tree with your 
hand? Try it.” 
“Can you kick the tree? Try it.” 
“Ts this leaf as long as your hand? Let us measure 
and see.” 
“Ts it as broad as your hand?” 
“Which is broader, this leaf or your foot?” 
“Can you span this branch with your hands?” (Illus- 
trate.) 
“Can you put your fingers around father’s walking- 
stick?” “Why?” “Because it is thinner.” 
Show the child the difference between straight and 
crooked by pointing out the trunks of different trees. 
“Which one do you like better, the straight one or the 
crooked one?” 
THIRD YEAR 
Review the lessons of the preceding year, always 
amplifying and expanding them. Follow the same 
method. 
Additional Lessons: 
Until now the lessons have been confined mainly to
-P-A-G-E-126
  118 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
single visible facts. We shall now begin to compare 
and combine them. 
Let the child watch the tree swaying and bending in 
the wind. It is strong enough to resist. Ask: “What 
would happen if a much stronger storm should blow?” 
Show him a branch broken off, or a tree broken, by 
the wind. 
Explain and illustrate that without the support of 
the underground roots which anchor it, the tree could 
not resist the wind, any more than a broom could 
stand upside down alone. If possible, show the child 
a tree uprooted by the wind. 
Now try to give the child such a notion of the tree 
(or of any other object in question) that the name 
calls to his mind not only one part of the tree—the 
part from crown to foot—but the whole tree, from 
crown to root-tip. He should see the underground 
stem and branches, which may be considered an in- 
verted image of the upper tree, that, in certain cases, 
is normally quite as large as the upper tree. It takes 
a very long time for a child to understand all this, to 
connect effect with cause. The capability of spelling 
and pronouncing a word does not prove understand- 
ing. Patient and constant repetition and variation are 
necessary. The teacher-mother should not ask the 
young child whether he understands a thing, for he 
does not know whether he does or not. She must 
find this thing out by suitable and searching questions. 
Find a pool of water in which a tree is mirrored. 
Moruer: “Look at this picture. What do you see?” 
Cui1p: “I see a tree growing upside down, and the 
sky is under it.” 
Explain this to the child. Then explain that, except
-P-A-G-E-127
  Opening the Mind’s Gateways 119 
for leaves (and fruit or seeds) this picture shows what 
the underground part of the tree is like. The main 
root, which appears in the picture as the trunk, some- 
times continues straight down for many feet, unless 
it encounters an obstacle that makes it grow crooked. 
From this main root extend its branches, called roots, 
diminishing in size from the surface downward. From 
these roots grow the rootlets, corresponding to the 
twigs. A small plant, as a dandelion, which has a tap- 
root, may be pulled or dug up, and will illustrate this 
in a small way. 
Now let the child draw pictures of trees as they 
appear to him. These drawings will be only crude 
sketches and should show trunk, branches, roots, and 
leaves. Correct drawings must not be expected. 
“When is the tree’s shadow longer, in the morning, 
at noon, or at night?” 
“Does the shadow always lie on the same side of the 
trees” 
Show the child how to measure the shadow by pac- 
ing it off. 
Cut a stick that measures the child’s own height and 
let him find with it how many times his height is the 
tree’s shadow, or find how many broom-handles (or 
yardsticks) long the shadow is. 
Tell the child about the sap mounting to the tree- 
top and nourishing the wood and leaves. 
Such lines as the following are suitable for memo- 
rizing: 
“How do the leaves grow 
In spring, upon the stem? 
The sap wells up with a drop for all, 
And that is life to them.”
-P-A-G-E-128
  120 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
FOURTH YEAR 
Review the lessons of the preceding year, always 
amplifying and expanding them. Follow the same 
method. 
We shall continue to use the tree as an example of 
such amplification and expansion. 
Make the child find and bring a large leaf, perfect 
and complete in all its parts. “Notice the framework 
of this leaf. This framework is made up of veins, or 
tiny hollow tubes, like those which you can trace under 
your own skin.” (Show him.) “That large central 
vein is the midrib.” (Show him that the midrib ex- 
tends from the leaf-stalk; thus some leaves have more 
than one midrib; the maple has five.) “Is the midrib 
branched?” “Do these other veins start from the 
midrib or from the base of the leaf?” 
Let the child lay the leaf flat on a piece of paper 
and following the outline with a pencil, trace it, then 
draw the framework. This crude sketch should show 
whether the veins branch from the midrib or extend 
from the leaf-base. 
“These veins have an important use. You have 
learned about the sap or juice of a tree. It carries up 
to the leaves and into their veins the water and food- 
materials which the roots have sucked up from the 
earth. All water above the quantity needed is breathed 
out by the leaves as vapor into the air. The food- 
materials are, with the help of sunlight, changed into 
plant-food, much as our food is prepared by the diges- 
tive organs before it reaches the various parts of our 
body. Thus the plant-food is carried away by the sap 
to every part of the tree, from root to crown.
-P-A-G-E-129
  
Opening the Mind’s Gateways 121 
“What would happen to the tree if more or less of 
the sap, or all of the sap, were to leak out?” 
“Tt would be sickly.” “It would die.” 
“This bleeding of the tree can and should be 
stopped.” Mention might be made here of first aid to 
the injured. 
“A tree grows from the inside out. Each year it 
puts on a new layer of wood inside the bark, which 
stretches the bark, and if the latter is tough, cracks or 
tears it.” 
“Tn the autumn the sap ceases to flow into the trunk 
and feeds the roots only which are kept warm in 
Mother Earth’s lap. The tree goes to sleep for the 
winter. What changes take place in the tree’s appear- 
ance?” 
“What colors can you find in the autumn leaves?” 
“Can you tread silently on the fallen leaves?” “Why 
not?” 
“Early next spring the big winds will help to awaken 
the trees; the bending and swaying start the sap climb- 
ing, just as the squeezing of a sponge and the subse- 
quent relaxing of pressure will make water fill it. 
This is one of the many useful things which the winds 
do. Can we wonder that the ancients thought that the 
winds were gods? Can you name any other useful 
things that the winds do?” 
Have the child look for lichen, fungi, moss, mistle- 
toe, and the like, growing on trees. “How do the 
storms help the trees to keep free of such a growth?” 
“Tf there were no storms the tree might die of their 
too rank growth.” 
“What God sends is always well, 
Though why, ’tis often hard to tell.”
-P-A-G-E-130
  
122 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
Show the child the fruit of trees. Make him under- 
stand that all trees, not only so-called fruit-trees, bear 
fruit, that the word fruit means the seed and its sur- 
rounding tissue, not merely something good to eat. 
“See how the seeds are protected (for instance, in 
’ acorn, cone, nut, apple, peach, etc.).” ‘Do the seeds 
need such protection?” 
Let the child hunt for a baby seedling, examine, re- 
plant, tend, and watch it. See that the tending is care- 
fully and regularly done. Hunt for larger seedlings; 
pull up a few worthless ones to see root-formation. 
Note the peculiar smell of the fresh earth on the roots. 
Let the child, where possible, watch the process of tree- 
transplanting and notice the care taken to lay undam- 
aged roots out as they grow. 
“What are roots?” “Roots are the part of the tree 
that is underground.” 
“Of what use are they?” “They hold the tree firmly 
and draw food and water for it from the ground.” 
“What is the bark?” “The bark is the skin of the 
tree.” 
(Explain the colloquialism, “I barked my shins.’’) 
“What parts of the tree are bark-covered?” 
“The trunk and branches are bark-covered.” 
“What causes the cracks or furrows in the bark of 
this maple (or oak, willow, apple-tree, etc.) ?” 
“The tree grows from the inside and bursts its 
bark.” 
“Could the tree live if the bark were removed?” 
“No, because the sap would leak out.” 
“Are the roots and rootlets bark-covered?” 
“Yes, they are, just as the trunk and twigs.”
-P-A-G-E-131
  Opening the Mind’s Gateways 123 
“What is a twig?” “A twig is a small branch.” 
“What is the fruit of this tree called (oak, maple, 
beech, one of the so-called fruit-trees, one of the coni- 
fers, etc.)” 
“Great oaks from little acorns grow.” 
“What is a seed?” 
“A seed is the part of the fruit from which a new 
tree can spring.” 
“What is a seedling?” “A seedling is a baby tree.” 
When the child has a notion of what our model tree 
is, through learning a large number of the character- 
istics which any one special tree has in common with 
all other trees, we may pass from one kind of tree to 
various kinds of trees, to make that notion clear and 
general. 
“What kind of tree is nearest the house?” 
“What kind is nearest the fence?” 
“What kind of tree has the largest trunk?” “The 
longest trunk?” 
“Which one has the largest branches?” 
“Which one can you climb?” 
“Which one is the best home for the birds?” “Why?” 
Let the child observe many points of difference in 
trees—size, form, bark, odor, leaf. 
“Name trees that have rough bark; smooth bark?” 
“Name a tree that has long, narrow leaves, broad 
leaves, leaves pointed at the tip, leaves with a sawlike 
edge.” 
A suitable quotation is: ““We all do fade, as a leaf.”

FIFTH YEAR 
Review the lessons of the preceding year, always 
amplifying and expanding them. 
Additional Lessons: 
Have the child tell you from his own observation 
which trees, like the maple, shed their leaves in uutumn 
and which trees, like the pine, retain their leaves until 
new ones are formed. The latter, as well as the former, 
shed their leaves, but at different seasons. As proof, 
observe the leaves or needles of conifers on the 
ground. Observe the bright new leaves and the dull 
old ones on the tree. 
Explain the meaning of to grow: “To increase in 
size and strength by a natural process.” 
Lead the child to see that, while most conifers are 
“evergreen,” all are not evergreen—the tamarack or 
larch, for example. A true evergreen is the English 
ivy. 
“A green old age.” (Always look for similar phrases 
and saws to introduce a figurative and metaphorical 
meaning of words.) 
Let the child find in the vegetable and animal king- 
dom as many examples as possible of periodical shed- 
ding and renewal as a part of the process of growing; 
the stag shedding and renewing his antlers; the lob- 
ster its shell; the snake its skin; the locust its coat; 
- the barnyard fowl its feathers; the horse and cow their 
hair; the fur-bearing animal its fur. 
Procure, if you can, a cross-section (or its picture) 
of a tree-trunk and show the rings of annual growth. 
Make the child understand from this the long, long 
time it takes for some trees to attain their growth.
-P-A-G-E-133
  Opening the Mind’s Gateways 125. 
Let him strip from a newly-cut log the tough outer 
bark and the soft inner bark. Contrast texture and 
color. Point out that the human skin has two layers, 
but do not plague the child of seven with such terms 
as dermis and epidermis. 
Explain girdling: “making a circular cut around 
the tree through the bark.” Illustrate by helping the 
child girdle a tree-section or stump, not a living tree, 
as it would be injured. Let him girdle the living 
tree with white chalk. 
Apply the following method to make clear that part 
of Longfellow’s poem, “Hiawatha,” which describes 
removing the bark from a standing birch to make a 
canoe. 
“With his knife the tree he girdled.” 
“What did he do?” 
“He made a cut around the tree with his knife.” 
“But the poem says: ‘Just beneath its lowest 
branches.’ Show me on this tree where the cut was 
made.” 
When the child correctly “girdles” the tree with his 
chalk, repeat the next verse: 
“Just above the roots he cut it.” Make the child 
mark this cut also. 
Then: “Down the trunk, from top to bottom,” the 
child draws the chalk. 
“Sheer he cleft the bark asunder.” 
“What does cleft mean?” Make clear its meaning 
as cut. 
“What does asunder mean?” 
“What does sheer mean here?” “It means en- 
tirely.” 
Next: “With a wooden wedge he raised it.” Let
-P-A-G-E-134
  126 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
the child find a wedge and indicate the motions by 
which he would raise the bark. 
“Stripped it from the trunk unbroken.” 
Make the child hold a large sheet of wrapping paper 
so as to form a hollow cylinder, to understand better 
the form of the bark. Make him see that it was still 
the size and form of the tree-trunk. Ask him how the 
tree now looked without its wrapper, and tell him how 
it “shivered in the breeze of morning.” 
This lesson shows how lessons in language must be 
coérdinated with lessons in observation and must be 
based on them. 
On several trees let the child find the distance from 
their lowest branches to their roots by climbing to the 
first branch, letting down a plumb-line, and then meas- 
uring its length with a foot-rule. Let him find the 
length of the tree’s circumference by using a tape- 
measure. Then let him tell you the length and width 
of the flattened sheet of bark that could be removed 
from the tree. Do this many times, with many kinds 
of trees and with trees of different sizes. After that, 
let the child estimate first, then measure, to see whether 
his estimate is correct. 
Explain circumference, “the line that goes around 
the tree, making a circle.” Let him find the circum- 
_ ference of many trees, so that the word will always 
be correctly associated with its meaning. After he 
has found the circumference of a tree-stump, show him 
how to find the diameter, “the length of a straight line 
through the center, from side to side,” and have him 
chalk this line if possible on the upper surface. 
“Now name each one of the different parts of a tree 
in order.”
-P-A-G-E-135
  Opening the Mind’s Gateways 127 
“Root, trunk, bark, branch, bough or limb, twig, 
leaf, sap, fruit, seed.” 
“Ts a tree a natural or an artificial object?” 
When the child once understands that it is natural, 
ask: “To which of the three great kingdoms does it 
belong—animal, vegetable, or mineral?” 
When the child has been made to understand that it 
belongs to the vegetable kingdom, lead him to see the 
difference between tree, shrub, and bark. If the child’s 
answer is incorrect, do not give the correct answer, 
but lead the child to find for himself the correction of 
his false answer by showing him in what points his 
answer is wrong. Through mistakes and corrections 
the child forms for himself a clear notion of the sub- 
ject. 
“What are leaves?” 
“Leaves are the part of the tree by means of which 
it breathes.” 
“What is a tree?” 
“A tree is a plant ten feet or more in height, which 
is woody and has one trunk.” (This should be “which 
has a woody tissue,” but the word tissue is at this time 
too difficult and should be avoided.) 
“What are woods?” 
“Woods are tracts of land covered with underbrush 
and with trees that are not fruit-trees.” 
“What is a forest?” 
“A forest is a large tract of woods.” 
Now lead the child on to discover for himself and 
from his own experience the many and varied benefits 
which we owe to trees. 
(Avoid as much as possible at this stage the phrase 
of what use instead of what benefit. It is much too 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
128 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
early to introduce the idea of commercial value, which 
leads to materialism. Benefits, on the other hand, 
engenders the idea of gratitude.) 
“Trees shelter buildings and cattle from big storms. 
They protect the ground from damage by heavy rains, 
the drops striking the leaves and rolling down instead 
of tearing the ground. They loosen the earth, so that 
water soaks into it instead of running off the surface 
and causing disastrous floods, then drouth. They les- 
sen the danger of fires sweeping large areas. They 
afford protection and homes for pest-destroying birds. 
They furnish fuel. Many industries depend wholly 
or partly on trees—building; furniture-making; ship- 
building; tanning of hides. Trees add beauty and 
character to the landscape.” 
Through questioning try to make the child realize 
on what tree-life, as all life, depends: air, heat, water, 
light. Let the child experiment with small plants, 
preferably weeds, to test this. For instance, let him 
transplant a vigorous weed with plenty of good earth 
in which it grows, in a flower-pot, water it well, and 
put it in a dark place. What would be the effect of 
the absence of light? Now vary the conditions and 
put another weed, similarly transplanting in a sunny 
place, but do not water it. What would now be the 
result? and so on. You cannot expect the child of 
seven to understand all conditions connected with such 
an experiment. Use your own judgment. Good judg- 
ment is more often shown by what you do not say than 
by what you do. 
Such lines as the following are suitable for memo- 
rizing:
-P-A-G-E-137
Opening the Mind’s Gateways 129 
“Sing for the oak-tree, 
The monarch of the wood; 
Sing for the oak-tree, 
That groweth green and good; 
That groweth broad and branching 
Within the forest’s shade; 
That groweth now and still shall grow 
When we are lowly laid.” 
“Can you find two leaves exactly alike?” The search 
for them finally leads to the soul-compelling thought 
that God has designed millions of leaves, each and 
every one different from the others. Remember, I 
would not state that there are no two leaves exactly 
alike. Even a young child should learn better than to 
state as a fact something of which the contrary has 
yet to be proved. We are all too ready to jump at 
conclusions and generalize on a limited amount of 
evidence. 
From the particular knowledge gained little by little 
through the senses, the pupil arrives in due time at 
general notions, to which there is no safe and sound 
short-cut. 
A child must learn the same thing about a great 
many separate things before he can combine this knowl- 
edge into generalities. Contrary to the general impres- 
sion, children learn slowly. You must repeat the sim- 
plest lessons day after day, always varying the point 
of view. 
Do not be misled into assuming that repetition is 
monotonous to the child. Observation, thus taught, 
brings fresh wonders with each repetition. One cause 
for many admitted educational failures is the teacher’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  130 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
repugnance to sticking to one thing, going patiently 
over and over it until understanding comes, and only 
then encouraging the pupil to make his own deductions. 
That is why the present usual school course makes it 
difficult for the pupils so unfortunate as to go step by 
step through the grades, ever to arrive at independence 
of thought and opinion on subjects of vital importance. 
. Iam not speaking so much of the school as you knew 
it, or as your parents knew it, but as it is to-day.

CHAPTER VIII 
PLAY 
In recent years many attempts have been made to 
write something new on this very old subject of child’s 
play, and with such success that the reader who goes 
through these volumes is tempted to believe that this 
phase of child-training was perhaps best understood, 
or at least best managed, in those good old times when 
it was least discussed. My immediate criticism is 
directed towards the cold-blooded analysis of every 
single game that children ever played and loved, in 
order that its practical value for strengthening muscles 
or increasing brain area may be catalogued. © 
Not long ago a man who is distinguished as a class- 
room vivisectionist of children’s minds paid a visit 
to our schoolyard during recess. The pupils were 
enjoying themselves in various simple games, not one 
of which met with the great man’s approval, that of 
‘seesaw exciting his displeasure particularly, on the 
ground that it had no practical advantages either phys- 
ically or intellectually, nor even the recommendation 
of socially sensitizing the children. In fact, as far as 
he could see, it was not much good. The idea of “so- 
cially sensitizing’ my pupils completely disarmed me, 
for neither you nor I would brave discussion with such 
a walking repository of words. Now that we are at 
a safe distance, however, let us ask ourselves what 
we can say in favor of the maligned seesaw. When a

soothing warmth on the beach, where they made good 
their footing and basked and sprawled and dug their 
claws into the sand, all the while feeling grow within 
their hard-shelled or soft-shelled bosoms an urge 
towards the higher life, a tail-swinging life, if you 
please, among the tree-tops. These offensive parallels 
are continued to infinity, or at least to the anti-climax 
that baby’s enjoyment of making mud pies and his 
digging in the earth are manifestations of “a special 
digging instinct acquired in long centuries of an ances- 
tral diet of worms.” 
Frankly, mothers, are you not weary to death of 
such impiety, such blind and insensate folly? Is it 
necessary to accept the explanation of monkey ancestry 
in order to recognize and utilize the fact that children 
are busy, inquisitive little mortals, naturally active in 
every fiber of their bodies? May not your baby smile 
back at you without incurring the risk of having a 
naturally busy animal psychologist appear around the 
corner and analyze the smile as a mere anthropoid 
instinct to imitate the movements of your facial mus- 
cles? Is the toddler who clings to your fingers, or 
climbs the stairs or investigates the button box, merely 
giving expression to the hand-swinging, tree-climbing, 
general “monkeying” tendencies inherited from an 
ugly ape? Every mother knows better. 
What a pity that so much intelligence should waste 
itself picking flaws in the divine harmony, in order to 
prove that we are no more in the eternal plan than the 
lizard or the flea. What an impulse towards human 
betterment will be manifested when educators rid their 
minds of the notion of children as Darwinian speci- 
mens and, through clear-eyed, sympathetic, firsthand  
-P-A-G-E-142
    134. Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
observation and reflection, see them once more as young 
human beings, sent from heaven into this world to get 
their schooling for eternity. Let us look for human 
reasons for allowing and encouraging children to play 
—we shall find them a-plenty. 
First, which would be all-sufficient, even if no other 
could be given, play is an absolute necessity to health 
of mind and body, and those who do not have a chance 
to play when they are young will play when they are 
old—to their destruction. Play leads naturally to the 
serious business of life. It is the duty of parents to 
see that this is done, but not to substitute work for 
play or play for work. Merely because the hall gives 
entrance to other parts of the house does not justify 
the use of the hall for all domestic purposes. Let every- 
thing be done decently and in order. Play develops 
the body much more systematically than can any regu- 
lar gymnastics. The best recommendation that could 
be made for any system of bodily exercises is that it 
closely imitates the spontaneous play of childhood. 
To the mind play is what the pendulum is to the 
clock—it keeps the works from going too swiftly. 
When a child’s mind grows faster than the body look 
out for trouble. Mental over-activity consumes the 
available nerve-force, and if once the little mind starts 
working too fast, it will take more wisdom and under- 
standing than most people possess to offset the habit. 
The child cannot stop of its own accord, and broken 
nerves and disarranged reason may follow. The pre- 
ventive as well as the cure is a great deal of occupation 
—which means, while the child is growing, busy fingers 
rather than too busy a brain. A considerable part of 
each day should be spent in such physical occupation,
-P-A-G-E-143
Play 135 
with the child safe from instruction or even being 
talked to. Through undirected play the imagination 
is stirred and developed. ‘Training the imagination” 
through formal lessons is a tragic waste of time and 
effort, for both the image-making and the impulse to 
it must come from within. 
In many of the following suggestions for play, occu- 
pation, activity, or whatever you choose to call the 
things children do because they like to be busy, you 
may find only partially concealed the “practical pur- 
pose” dear to our materialistic propagandists, but we 
hope and believe that many others of them are entirely 
incapable of being ticketed as of actual use. As a 
dreamer has remarked, “Excellence after a certain 
point is sure to go a-limping,” which will be our motto 
throughout the rest of the chapter. 
Good children are not born, but made. What we 
call badness is not the disease but the symptom. A 
good physician does not aim at removing symptoms, 
but goes to the root of the ailment in order to cure and 
heal. Experimenting with symptoms, suppressing or 
concealing them, shows lack of understanding, wisdom, 
and sincerity. In child-management as in forestry, the 
best remedy for crookedness is prevention, and play is 
the simplest preventive of naughtiness and a most 
important prop of discipline, for lack of something to 
do causes more fretting and fussing, more discontent 
and disobedience than does anything else. 
It is just as much a part of the mother’s responsi- 
bility to play with the baby and provide it with suitable 
playthings, as it is to feed and clothe it. When a young 
child is troublesome and you are sure that neither 
stomach nor clothing is at fault, then look for the
-P-A-G-E-144
  136 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
trouble in lack of occupation, too few or too many toys, 
an excess of variety, people, attention, or company. 
It is a pity that children should ever lack amusement 
when it can be provided with so little cost and trouble. 
The child is alert, eager, wanting to know and to do, 
his very nature demands intense busy-ness, and when 
no outlet is provided he contrives one, whereupon we 
call him mischievous or even bad. When one gives the 
toddler a few playthings he not only instantly becomes 
“good,” but proceeds to instruct himself far more 
effectively than could a trained kindergartner. 
This morning I called at a friend’s house and found 
the three-year-old hugging the fire-shovel. His mother 
remarked: ““When Benny can have that kitchen shovel 
to dig with, he is a good boy all day long.” 
“What does his little brother like?” I asked. 
“Oh, just give him any kind of little box or some 
spools and he asks for nothing more,” she replied. 
In one corner of my school room a little girl of 
four attends to her housekeeping. She scrubs her 
tiny blackboard, bakes sand-cakes, and looks after her 
dollies without annoyance to teacher or pupils. Here 
I must digress for a moment. To the casual observer 
Elizabeth is “the world forgetting, by the world for- 
got.” Rarely do I find her eyes turned on me or on 
the pupils, but when she goes “home,” which is down- 
Stairs, she proceeds to instruct her doll-family or her 
baby brother according to Miss Lynch’s methods. Her 
“Sit properly!” “Straighten your shoulders!” “Put 
down your pencil!” are the preliminary to yards and 
yards of epic poetry, given as faultlessly as if she were 
twice as old. As I have said before, do not make the 
mistake of imagining that because the four-year-old
-P-A-G-E-145
Play 137 
is extremely busy she is not paying attention, for she 
is always doing so. 
A little boy plays frequently in my office and while 
I am writing we pretend we cannot talk, a plan which 
works so well that it is usually I who breaks the silence. 
One day, when he had constructed from bits of raffia 
a menagerie of ferocious beasts and caged them under 
the chairs, I asked: “Are the animals enjoying them- 
selves, Shipley?” 
“No,” he corrected me, “they are enjoying each 
other.” 
A troublesome form of baby wickedness arises from 
the fact that children have no clear perception of the 
difference between what is living and what is lifeless. 
The child will pull a fly to pieces with the same uncon- 
cern that he will pull apart a flower. During the first 
three years, give him only such playthings as he may 
pull apart if he pleases. Only gradually, during the 
kindergarten period, can you teach him the general 
difference between what may properly be investigated 
and what must be left alone. 
Sand is perhaps the most natural plaything. A sand 
pile or sand table for play and instruction is splendid 
for children of all ages, furnishing as it does material 
for building, washing, planting, and cooking, while 
no costly apparatus is so effective in teaching and 
learning something about measuring, forming, build- 
ing, etc. Think of Archimedes, who angrily shouted, 
“Do not disturb my circles!” to the Roman soldiers 
who found him placidly drawing circles in the sand 
when they sacked the city. Put the baby in the sand 
bin. He contents himself with digging, piling the sand 
up, pouring it on his head by handfuls. A few months
-P-A-G-E-146
  138 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
later he will grind the dry sand through your old flour 
sieve, shovel it into his pail with iron spoon or clam 
shell, pour it through the funnel into a bottle, empty 
the bottle and fill it again. For a five-year-old sprinkle 
the sand and he will use it for modeling, building, 
bread-mixing. A year or so later he will draw in it 
and outline the drawings with pebbles. If you cannot 
get the pure white seashore sand, almost any plaster- 
ing sand will do. 
Encourage play with toys which the children make 
themselves, for thus they become inventive, self-reliant, 
and quickminded. Building a “log” house of sticks 
teaches them to plan a more pretentious building, to 
make mental images before the actual execution of 
the plan. Home-made playthings answer every need, 
while modern complex toys stunt the imagination, since 
they leave nothing to be imagined and teach the child 
to be destructive rather than constructive. 
The baby busies himself with all sorts of objects, 
turning the handle of a coffee-mill, shaking a rattle, 
pulling out drawers, dabbling and splashing in water. 
It pleases him merely to lay one stick upon another. 
Paper to rustle and tear, a ball to throw, a ball on a 
string, something to open and shut, like a box or a 
purse, a handful of buttons or dried beans in a box, 
even a flower, a leaf or a stick, will hold a child’s atten- 
tion for a long time. Best of all is a potato. 
Baby’s first attempts at building will be to place the 
dominoes or blocks in a row upon the floor, his next 
to pile them up in a tower. A two-year-old will amuse 
himself by the hour with a small pail of water, a funnel, 
a bottle or two, and a cup, and will seldom spill the 
water,
-P-A-G-E-147
  Play 139 
Few toys furnish a greater variety of entertainment 
than a dozen old-fashioned clothes-pins. Baby thrusts 
the split ends together and pulls them apart, piles them 
up for a house and by and by learns to build house, 
barn, arbor, pergola, fence. 
Dear to a baby’s heart is “something with a hole in 
it.” It may be paper, pasteboard, a piece of cigar box, 
but the hole is the thing. He sticks one finger through 
and tries to pull it off on the other side. If he ever gets 
tired of this give him bright scraps of cloth from your 
piece-bag, or a lock and key to play with, or a tiny 
solid mirror to throw the sunlight on a dark surface. 
An empty shoe-box fulfils a manifold destiny. With 
a string attached it may be drawn about the room as 
a doll carriage, farm wagon, trolley car, and dump cart. 
Wagons, cars and trains of cars may be made from 
empty spool boxes, the wheels being contrived of 
wooden button molds fastened on with largeheaded 
pins. To such a wagon we harness a burly quadruped 
made from a potato, with safety matches for legs 
and ears, match-heads or pepper corns for eyes, and a 
carven grin. 
How a small boy loves an old watch, or anything 
with wheels! He likes little garden tools, and a broom- 
stick for a horse, while the little girl likes a small broom 
and duster, old dishes for housekeeping, old clothes to 
“dress up” in. A basin of water in which to float chips 
or sticks or walnut shells, each loaded with suitable 
freight or passengers, is sometimes in order. While 
we work in the kitchen, a small piece of dough, a paper 
breadboard and a toy rolling pin, make the child happy 
and busy turning out biscuits, cookies, bread, and pies. 
What child does not love a hammer and board and a
-P-A-G-E-148
  140 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
few tacks? Better than a board, a few shingles may 
be given him, for the delight of tacking the thin ends 
together—and pulling them apart. Teach the baby 
to play games like peek-a-boo, hide-and-seek, riding a 
stick, and singing or saying “Ride a gray horse.” 
Teach him to string shoe buttons or kindergarten beads 
on shoestrings to make chains for mother. 
The child’s sweetest play is imitation of the parents’ 
work, for the things he sees father and mother do every 
day fascinate and instruct him beyond measure. His 
curiosity is aroused at seeing something being done, he 
wonders if he could do it, and instinctively he goes 
through the motions. Great is the joy at the accom- 
plishment when he succeeds. It is very easy to under- 
stand that imitation is the most important single factor 
in education. While observing a thing being done, the 
child is really doing it mentally, and when he sets his 
hand to it, he learns so quickly, from having seen the 
same thing done over and over, that it almost seems as 
if the knowledge were born in him. That is one reason 
why the finest workmen in the world are in those coun- 
tries where trades are handed down from father to son. 
A great part of children’s play being imitation of work, 
we should at an early stage direct play towards what 
is good and useful by introducing work, both to sweeten 
play and to lead the child from irresponsibility to a 
serious idea of his place in the universe. 
A child should not play too much, for when play is 
pursued to the point of exhaustion we have a naughty 
child to deal with. Even the child of two should be 
“helping mother” part of the day, no matter if the time 
and trouble it costs are considerable. After all, it takes 
less time to interest a child in what you are doing and
-P-A-G-E-149
  Play 141 
keep him safely busy than it does to rush about in the 
vain effort to keep an idle child out of mischief. More- 
over, he will play with greater zest in the afternoon if 
he has been “‘working” in the morning, the toys which 
he has not seen for such a long, long time seeming a 
greater treat. 
You can do nothing better for the child than keep 
him with you and let him do the drippings of your 
work. 
Here are some of the things that a baby of two is 
doing each day to help his mother: Helps make the 
bed, patting the pillows and carrying them to the chair 
to air; tries to smooth the sheets and tuck in the 
blankets; uses dry mop, picks up toys, carries shoes 
from bathroom to closet, etc.; when mother is cooking 
he sits on a stool near by, watching her movements and 
stirring the mixtures when she can allow it; when she 
sweeps she lets him sweep the dirt into the dustpan and 
carry it to the stove to be emptied; he carries cups and 
his own cereal to the table; he goes with his father to 
the cellar when he is attending the furnace. 
A boy of three who does most of the foregoing 
things has in addition the following tasks: to roll the 
rugs, lay them again after sweeping, carry in the kind- 
ling and small buckets of coal, feed the dog, help feed 
and water the chickens, take his little broom and help 
mother sweep. As his mother says, he is not a real 
help, but he is learning to help, and is not learning to 
help one of the finest things in life? 
A child’s natural playmates are his parents. To 
widen the circle too early or too rapidly is hurtful. 
During the first three years the child does not need 
companionship other than the parents and a pet or a
-P-A-G-E-150
142 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
baby. During the kindergarten period, or until seven, 
he should have playmates occasionally but not all the 
time. One playmate at a time is better than several. 
Teach the child to amuse himself and to play alone, 
“Which will later be of inestimable value and influence 
his whole future in many ways that you will notice as 
time goes on. Quiet is very important for young chil- 
dren, and without it they get excited, cross, too tired 
to be refreshed by sleep. Learning to play alone is 
a conquest over self. It throws one upon his own re- 
sources. It is unfair to a child to have someone at all 
times ready to amuse and entertain him. When he 
is playing happily with mud or sand, or sticks or 
stones, a child is learning more than any direct instruc- 
tion could give. The busy little mind is growing, grop- 
ing for knowledge. Wanting to know seems more 
worth while than merely knowing. 
If you begin with the young baby, you will have no 
trouble in training him to play alone, but even a young 
baby given unnecessary attention begins to feel discon- 
tented unless someone is constantly with him. Make a 
practice of leaving him alone in the middle of the bed, 
and as soon as he is able to crawl, leave him on a quilt 
on the floor to kick and roll and crawl. A baby pen, 
about four feet square, in which he is safe to tumble, 
or play with toys, or learn to walk, is a great sedative. 
When weather permits keep this pen outdoors. It 
should be high enough for the baby to stand in, with 
a rug in the bottom so that he cannot pick up fallen 
leaves, twigs, etc., to eat. Throw over the pen a 
mosquito netting weighted at the corners with snap 
clothespins and then leave baby alone with his play- 
things, so far at attention is concerned. A chair-swing
-P-A-G-E-151
  Play 143 
just high enough so that baby can swing himself by 
kicking the ground is a suitable place for him for 
shorter periods than in the pen, which provides more 
freedom to exercise. Tie a few playthings to the 
swing. If you did not begin early, time and tact and 
patience and fortitude will be needed to break the habit 
of depending upon others for entertainment. 
I have in mind a child of two who had become so 
very restive and dependent upon the attention of others 
for amusement that he did not allow the nurse to leave 
him for even five minutes. A level-headed nurse was 
called in to take charge, and she simply made the baby 
stay alone in an open porch, safe with playthings, for 
an hour or so daily. Having learned after a few days 
that protests were unavailing, he took his medicine 
quietly. 
Make up your mind that you will give the child less 
help, which will mean for you a gain of time and 
temper. To occupy him and make him entertain him- 
self instead of having somebody continually at his beck 
and call, you must give him regular simple lessons in 
doing things that he can continue to do by himself. 
Make a start by playing with him for a few minutes, 
and then leave him alone to continue playing the same 
game. 
Your difficulty will arise from his refusing to con- 
tinue playing unless you stay with him, and this is 
where you must use your authority. Do not let him 
make you a slave to his laziness and his instinctive 
desire for domination, but after you have shown him 
how to do something such as I shall describe and make 
certain that he can do it make him do it. Be prepared 
for an obstinate struggle; you may even have to pun-
-P-A-G-E-152
  
144 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
ish him, but he must learn to understand that whatever 
you tell him to do must be done. It may seem unrea- 
sonable to punish a child for not playing as you tell him 
to play, but he knows no difference between frivolous 
toying and healthful playing, the necessary and the 
unnecessary, and you must think for him now. The 
child who learns to play by himself will learn to work 
by himself. The higher we rise, the more we segregate 
ourselves in our work, gregarious working being rem- 
iniscent of slave-driving. Then find time each day, 
fifteen or twenty minutes at first, during which the 
child can be left with his playthings in a sunny room 
or on a porch, safe but quite alone. Leave him reso- 
lutely in that salutary seclusion, and do not allow him 
to disturb you during that period. If at first ten- 
minute periods seem more reasonable, try these, length- 
ening them a few minutes daily until he has an hour 
in which he must work out his own amusement. 
Here is something that a child of two or older can 
be made to do alone: Give him a pail of apples to be 
placed, one at a time, or two at a time, into another 
receptacle. A child of three can be made to put aside 
all that begin to be spotty or bruised. This is only a 
suggestion that may help you to think of things that 
will keep him busy for some time, yet are neither too 
difficult nor too tedious. You can teach him in this 
way the good old nursery rhyme: “The animals went , 
in one by one.” 
Here is a more difficult lesson: Take sticks of any 
length and show or suggest how to make a log cabin 
by placing them criss-cross. This house of fancy will 
be a delight, especially when he finds a use for it, as 
a pigsty, henhouse, dollhouse, stable, etc., but he will 
 
-P-A-G-E-153
  Play 145 
be interested in making it only if it is to represent 
something familiar to him. Put an animal in, per- 
haps a potato with toothpicks for limbs and shoe but- 
tons for eyes, and see to it that he cannot get out. 
There is no gain in breaking up one kind of activity 
for another without good reason, and if the child is 
interested and keeps on with this play, do not interrupt - 
it unnecessarily, for some other. Attention to regular 
physical habits, such as nap or lunch, should be the 
only excuse for interruption. This play constitutes an 
unconscious lesson in observation, form, measure, 
manual training, etc—everything good for a young 
child. 
From the age of three onward, a child needs a play- 
mate for part of the time, for without such give and 
take, without being himself a buffer and having some- 
one for a buffer, there can be no coming out of his 
own shell. It is not possible for the most devoted 
mother to be both mother and playmate in full, nor 
is it either desirable or feasible for her to enter wholly 
into the necessary give and take. It is possible for 
her to be too much with the child, and this is where a 
playmate relieves the situation. In this respect a play- 
nurse is sometimes advisable for an only child, not so 
much because she is a good disciplinarian or teacher 
as because the child can have with her some leeway 
that would be out of place with the mother, for such 
freedom would give the child a chance to be naughty 
and the mother an occasion to correct him. A child 
who has never had the opportunity to be naughty will 
never be good, for virtue springs from resistance 
to vice. 
Do not be particular about hunting up a child of  
-P-A-G-E-154
iy 
os 146 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
your own social circle as a playmate. Any nice clean 
boy or girl will do, so long as there is no moral or 
physical contamination. Bring the child to your house 
and turn him loose with your child’s playthings, allow- 
ing play at the right time, for the proper length of time, 
under careful supervision, which, however, must not 
be noticeable. There should be as little apparent inter- 
ference as possible. 
Do not let them play too long at a time, else they 
will get tired and certainly make trouble. At the first 
symptom of discord, separate the children, no matter 
whose the fault, for it is possible to be entirely too 
judicial in settling children’s difficulties and after the 
trouble has started it is hard to decide who has been 
in the wrong. Besides, the children are laughing inside 
themselves at your particularities in this respect, know- 
ing instinctively that it was a mere chance as to who 
was the guilty party at that moment. The natural 
consequence to quarreling is to be separated, and will 
impress the children as just and fair. No child is 
too young to learn that he must either control him- 
self or suffer deprivations. If a child’s idea of play- 
ing is always to take the part that he particularly likes, 
he should learn to “take turns.” Let him learn to fit 
in, to adapt himself, to take his place among others, 
to give and take. 
Avoid insidious moral dangers. Do not allow chil- 
dren to play together unwatched, be within sight and 
hearing and watch them without seeming to do so, 
but at the same time they must not be complacently 
trusted to their own cunning devices. Head off evil 
before it comes anywhere near your children. I do 
not mean to prevent their being exposed to minor temp- 
 
-P-A-G-E-155
  Play 147 
tations and their getting into mischief and trouble, 
but I repeat that, if they are ever to become strong in 
character, they must have reasonable and sufficient 
leeway to do this and take the consequences. This, 
however, does not mean allowing them to run together, 
unwisely trusting to their innate goodness, for bad 
example appeals to a little child much more than good. 
When he is older, when wise discipline has checked 
the animal instincts and imbued him with the love of 
what is beautiful and right, then indeed the parents 
can send him out fearlessly to face the world alone and 
bad example will then only serve as a deterrent and a 
prevention. 
Keep children outdoors as much as is reasonable and” 
train them to use their muscles and all their limbs. 
Children should not be shielded altogether from the 
rougher side of life, but should get some of its hard- 
ness, especially in their outdoor play. Little girls need 
opportunity for the same kind of physical development 
and activity that boys need, at least during the first 
seven years. Dress boys and girls in such a way that 
they need not think about their clothing, whether in 
climbing trees or turning somersaults. 
The man of the house should think up simple 
schemes for helping children to be active, robust, 
supple, self-reliant, without incurring avoidable danger. 
He should teach them to guard against breaking their 
necks. Here is some of the simple apparatus he can 
rig up at almost no cost: A single rope hanging down, 
with a knot on the lower end, which children can seize 
and swing by; a “trolley,’”’ consisting of a single stout 
rope fastened like a clothes-line, by which the child can 
swing himself along, hand over hand, or by springing  
-P-A-G-E-156
  
148 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
can cling to and swing back and forth, which, you 
know, is a heavenly sensation, almost like flying; a 
long horizontal bar just high enough so that he can 
catch it by springing and walk along it hand over hand; 
a bar at the proper height for practice in ‘“‘chinning” 
himself; a securely set horizontal ladder for children 
of five or older to “walk” across on their hands. All 
these reaching and hand-swinging exercises are good; 
not that children will really be able to do them at 
first, but they should constantly be attempting such 
safe exercises. 
Set up a narrow plank horizontally a little above the 
ground for practice in steady walking. A beam 4 x 4, 
supported about eight or ten inches above the ground, 
answers the same purpose. If you can procure a round 
spar about three inches thick and twelve to fifteen feet 
long, set it up horizontally about six inches above the 
ground, which should be sandy if possible. Let the 
children walk along from end to end, balancing them- 
selves; then let them run along it. Let two boys each 
armed with a bag stuffed with rags, walk towards 
one another and try to knock one another off the spar 
with the bags. This is good sport, very amusing to 
children, and no harm can come of it unless it deterio- 
rates into horse-play. Such a spar can also be fitted up 
vertically, planted securely in the ground and fastened 
at the upper end to a stout branch of a high tree. Let 
the boys learn to climb it. Children get fun out of any 
kind of slide, the simplest being a smooth waxed board, 
down which they can slip. There is nothing that chil- 
dren like better than a rope swing with a board seat; 
to them it is not merely hempen rope but wings that 
. take them away from earth.

“To sail beyond the sunset, and the paths

If you can possibly manage it, turn a room into a 
playroom for the children, especially during the winter. 
It will relieve you greatly and give them a chance to 
make mistakes, to take the consequences, and to learn 
many things that only experience can teach. Such a 
room should be sunny, well-lighted, not over-heated, 
well-ventilated, and not obstructed by unnecessary fur- 
niture. The furniture, consisting of a table, chairs, 
rack for books and toys, and box for blocks, should 
be plain, solid, and with wide bases so that it cannot 
easily topple over. The floor should be either bare or 
covered with strong linoleum; there should be no rugs 
or carpets. Windows should be barred so that a child 
cannot fall out. The lights, if gas or oil lamps, should 
be so high that a child cannot touch them. The door 
should have a small window or peep-hole through 
which the children can easily be observed without 
their noticing it. In such a room they will be as safe 
as you can reasonably wish them to be. The pictures 
for the walls should be flat chromos of dogs, cats, 
children, etc., rather than finer pictures that as yet are 
meaningless to the children. Mother Goose pictures 
make a delightful border. Choose large rather than 
small pictures, and hang them on a level with the child’s 
eye. For curtains, box-covers, and $0 on, get cre- 
tonne with Mother Goose pictures on it, for samples 
of which you can write to some large department store. 
Decorate the rooms with crépe paper at Christmas, 
Hallowe’en, etc. 
Wherever and at whatever they play, make the chil-
-P-A-G-E-158
  150 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
dren put away their playthings in the proper places 
when through with them. Make them feel as early as 
possible that they are responsible for their own things, 
and never let them assume that someone will do their 
picking up for them. They will grow helpful, and per- 
haps they will infer that they are also responsible for 
their brother’s things. 
When the little girl is attending to her housekeeping, 
her patience is often sorely tried by the baby, who 
wants to help but whose unsteady little legs make him 
upset stove, dining-table, and even sister. It is very 
hard to make Baby understand that he must not meddle 
with sister's things, but do not get discouraged if you 
do not succeed. Tell sister that Baby is partly her 
baby and that she must not mind such funny accidents. 
Show her by example how patient you are when your 
plans get upset. If Baby pulls off her tablecloth, tell 
her that doilies are considered more suitable now than 
the cloth and that they can be cut out of paper. Large 
leaves will provide fine doilies and also plates. 
Or sister might set a table specially for Baby, so 
that the game will be equally interesting to both chil- 
dren, or she could set one for you, and you could let 
the baby have it. Teach sister that she must suppress 
little fits of naughty temper when an accident happens 
to her playthings. She must learn that Baby needs 
more attention than she does, and she will then begin 
to realize what you did for her, be all the more ready 
to show some kind of indulgence to the younger ones, 
and be kind and forbearing to everybody. 
A little girl of four and older should have her own 
home-made playhouse. Unless you have a better plan, 
give her a wooden packing box with horizontal parti-
-P-A-G-E-159
  Play 151 
tion, so that she can have an upstairs and a downstairs, 
and let her furnish it herself. With just a little dis- 
creet help she can make furniture out of pasteboard, 
small boxes can be utilized for cupboards and closets, 
little hooks can be screwed in for dolls’ clothing. She 
can put in tiny windows, paper the walls, and hang 
up little pictures. Do not buy any furniture for the 
playhouse, certainly no expensive furniture. Avoid 
sowing the seeds of arrogance by the purchase of any- 
thing costly, anything that smacks of showy preten- 
tiousness. 
For a child of six, a set of doll’s dishes, a kitchen 
stove, tin cooking utensils and accessories, will be a 
joy. Do not give her many of these things at once, but 
after she gets the stove, let her know what it is to wait 
and wish for the rest of the kitchen furnishings. That 
is a taste of real life and adds to the joy of receiving. 
Teach her to “manage” without things, thus when she 
gets the china set, she should manage for a time with- 
out the teaspoons. I do not mean to tantalize the child 
by withholding these things, but simply not to have 
the things for her the moment she would like to have 
them. No poor child of my acquaintance has ever 
impressed me as so hopelessly the embodiment of 
misery as a little friend of mine whose wealthy parents 
. make it their first care to see that she never has to 
wait for anything she desires, still less go without it. 
Not all young children care for a doll, but they 
should learn to do so, which, likewise, is a matter of 
imitation, not of instinct. Unless the little girl sees 
a baby being loved and petted, she will not love and 
pet her doll. When cradles went out of fashion for 
babies, they went out of fashion for dolls as well,
-P-A-G-E-160
  152 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
for the little girl will not rock her doll in the loveliest 
doll-cradle unless baby is rocked in a cradle. Teach 
the child to dress a doll, be it done ever so crudely. 
Never look for fine work in a young child. Odds and 
ends of muslin, silk, a scrap of fur for a stole or 
muff, give fine occupations for rainy days. If she 
has a big doll now, give her a little doll next time. 
The home-made doll is always the favorite. A hand- 
kerchief knotted or a piece of gay cloth tied around a 
clothespin makes a fine baby—the simpler the better. 
. If circumstances permit, by all means let the ‘child 
have a pet, whether dog, cat, calf, or bird. He should 
feed it, of course, with the necessary directions and 
help. Maybe you can recall the joy you felt in first 
holding the pail for a nice little calf to drink the warm, 
sweet, odorous milk. If you can find a good-tempered 
puppy to grow up with the child, it would develop and 
strengthen a side of character that needs a prop. 
Whether any caged pet supplies such a want, I am not 
prepared to say, there are so many pros and cons. On 
no account should the child be allowed to neglect the 
pet. Make him realize the responsibility for it, since 
it belongs to him. Such a feeling will soon become 
habitual and will be extended to other things and be- 
come a part of him, so that he will feel discontented 
and unhappy if he does not live up to it. 
Mothers sometimes say: “If I had known what a 
help a blackboard is in keeping children good and 
happy, I would have had one long ago.” Buy a strip 
of slated cloth three or four feet wide and from one 
to three yards long, according to your wall-space. 
Glue or paste it on a convenient wall—kitchen, nursery, 
playroom—at the right height for the children. You
-P-A-G-E-161
Play 153 
have procured a good, inexpensive, and long-wearing 
device for drawing and writing. Buy a quantity of 
dustless blackboard chalk and a dustless eraser. You 
can get a small quantity of colored crayons for special 
occasions. Get a piece of well-planed lath two or two 
and a half feet long for a ruler, or use a yardstick. 
Make yourself a pair of compasses of a piece of string 
with a loop to hold the chalk at one end and a nail for 
the center of the circles at the other end, and there is 
the whole outfit. The blackboard is far better for 
children than paper and pencil. They should write and 
draw large, swinging the arm freely. There is no 
danger of overstraining the mind or injuring the eye- 
sight by blackboard practice in writing and drawing, 
and besides, the large, free swing of the arm is held 
to stimulate mental growth, as the mind follows the 
hand in widening circles. 
Modeling-wax can be made at home at little cost. 
Take a cup of flour, a cup of salt, and a teaspoonful 
of powdered alum, add bluing water and work it to the 
right consistency for molding. From this the child 
can model mice and rats, cheese and traps. It can be 
kept a long time by wrapping in a damp cloth and 
keeping in a cool place, adding a little water each time 
it is used. Plasticene is also very satisfactory for 
modeling. Here is sufficient instruction for the child: 
Look at the dog and make one of wax like him. Count 
his legs and make the same number of legs with tooth- 
picks. 
I do not approve of kindergarten sewing cards be- 
ause of the eye-strain involved in their use. The 
ounger the child the greater the harm that results 
from the muscular jerks of the eye, which has not       
              
   
                  
   
    
-P-A-G-E-162
  
  154 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
reached complete development. Such work has not 
sufficient value to offset its risk. 
The girl should have a playhouse, the boy a box 
or drawer for his own treasures, and each wall-space 
for pinning their pictures—by the way, the kind they 
like, not the kind you like. 
From the age of three to seven is the age of make- 
believe. That is when things come alive, when chil- 
dren like what is alive or what they can pretend is 
alive or what behaves like something alive. Kites that 
fly, tops that spin, hoops that roll, are the daily bread 
at that age. Then a little boy puts his hands over his 
eyes and says, “Now you can’t see me.” He runs down 
the garden path at dusk and notices with wonder and 
awe that the big round moon is keeping up with him, 
smiling at him, as much as to say: “Little boy, did 
you think you could run away from me?” And when, 
overcome with the greatness of his discovery, he wheels 
about and runs to mother, a glance across his shoulder 
shows him that the moon has turned around and come 
back to her, too. 
Just keep in mind a few things like this when deal- 
ing with young children, how big and new and wonder- 
ful the world is to them, how big you are and how 
little they are, what a long hard road lies ahead of 
them, rough at the very best. This will help you to be 
gentle with them, gentle and fair, kind and firm and 
just. And if you would be fair and just, do not 
destroy their world of make-believe, but if they tell 
you that a fairy has built a castle in the front path 
over night, walk around it, even though it looks to 
you like nothing in the world but an ant-hillock. 
Although you may be unable to enter into the spirit of
-P-A-G-E-163
  Play 155 
their play, you can at least be silent and smile or 
look serious as the case demands, and refrain from 
always and ever labeling their mighty discoveries as 
“nothing buts.” 
The kitchen, woodshed, and attic, with such things 
as used to be found in these places, make the most 
wonderful workrooms for children. If you have no 
such rooms, do the best you can to approximate them 
and their contents. There should be a big wooden 
box for blocks and other heavy building material; 
the blocks should be large rather than small, the size 
and shape of ordinary bricks, and the box should also 
contain longer pieces, sections of two-by-fours, any 
rectangular and cylindrical chunks of wood, bits of 
boards, shingles, and bricks. The boy will like these 
things as soon as he can handle them, which may be 
sooner than you think. Other essentials to the build- 
ing trade are broken furniture, nails, screws, hammer, 
tacks, glue, clay, paint, sand-paper, staples, wheels (of 
typewriter ribbons and others), wire hairpins, paste- 
board boxes, button molds, large and small, a box of 
buttons, spools, etc. Dominoes have many advantages 
when it comes to making walks, fences, barns, trains, 
and freight. A boy will invent a hundred uses for a 
rope, a coil of wire, or wire screening. Of course he 
must have a bow and arrow, a ball and bat. 
A little forethought for the time when children 
must be in the house and under one’s feet will save 
trouble. Blunt-ended scissors, costing a few cents, 
and odds and ends of wallpaper, are a safe combina- 
tion. Children can cut up souvenir postcards into 
odd-shaped pieces to be put together again as puzzle 
pictures. Still better than postcards are large magazine
-P-A-G-E-164
  156 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
pictures, especially colored ones. There is no need to 
pay a dollar for picture-puzzles when you and the chil- 
dren can make them. Paste the colored pictures on 
cardboard and cut out irregularly, and when the chil- 
dren have finished with them make them put them 
into an envelope and lay them away for another day. 
Let them cut the white margins from newspapers 
into strips of the same width and about five inches long, 
and with flour paste, paste evenly together the ends 
of the first strip, through this loop pass another strip 
and paste the ends as before, making the second link. 
Continue in this way. Strips of colored paper, such 
as wrapping paper, may alternate with white, or col- 
ored magazine covers cut in strips three inches by one 
inch make a beautiful chain. Cutting out pictures, 
cutting pieces of paper into any definite form in the 
way the child pleases, and similar occupations, are 
excellent and should not be interfered with unneces- 
sarily as long as he is busily at work. 
A child of four will enjoy furnishing a kitchen when 
she has on hand the scissors, paste, and pictures, A 
pasteboard box, with holes cut for windows, and walls 
decorated appropriately or inappropriately, with cut- 
out designs or pictures, will be satisfying. Let her 
make from other boxes other rooms, such as bathroom, 
bedroom, etc. At least a week’s work is suggested in 
this paragraph. The rooms when finished may stand 
side by side or one above the other. A circus cage can 
be made by pasting strips of paper horizontally across 
the open face of a pasteboard box of any size or shape. 
Children from four to six like to play store, pro- 
viding their own stock by cutting illustrations out of 
an old mail-order catalogue and pasting them on card:
-P-A-G-E-165
Play 157 
board. They thus get a permanent supply of goods, to 
which they can add from time to time. Let them cut 
paper money, and hunt up a supply of wrapping 
paper, paper bags, and string. 
To make a scrapbook, cut several pieces of old mus- 
lin or cambric into square of the same size. In this, 
if you live on a farm, let the children paste pictures of 
a model farm. On the first page is the house, etc., 
including children and parents, on the next page the 
barn, farm-yard and livestock; farther on is a kitchen 
interior, with utensils and furniture; bedroom; bath- 
room. This can be extended and amplified by filling 
it with suitable pictures cut from our indispensable 
catalogue. If you do not live on a farm, the child will 
not care for this, but he should instead make scrap- 
books of animals, birds, flowers, trees, children. For 
paste use flour and cold water, which a few drops of 
clove-oil will keep from souring. 
For children not quite old enough to cut and paste, 
there is your scrapbag. Pieces of bright cloth please 
ababy. Let her sort the scraps. Then there are pencil 
and paper; a tiny mirror to throw the sunlight about; 
a glass prism to make rainbows; a wet string to lay in 
geometric shapes. 
Provide the children with a top by fitting a stick 
tightly into a spool and whittling spool and stick down 
to a pointed end on which it will spin. Show them 
how to make it spin and teach them to spin a tin plate. 
Let the little girl teach her doll-baby to walk, show- 
ing her how to move one foot in front of the other, 
as if it were a baby. When she gets the idea, tell her 
to make it walk around the rug twice; not to let it trip 
and fall; not to make it walk too fast, etc. This culti-
-P-A-G-E-166
  158 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
vates her imagination in a natural, healthful way. 
When she tires of the game she will probably tell you 
that the baby is tired. 
Take a cake pan with a tube, place it on the floor, 
give the children rubber rings from fruit jars, have 
them stand at a given distance from the pan and try 
to throw the ring over the tube. 
Blowing soap bubbles is a good, safe game, espe- 
cially if the children sit in the sunshine, letting the 
outdoors soak in, blowing bubbles, big and little, and 
watching them go sailing. There is no need to buy a 
bubble-set when a new clay pipe will de 
Give the child the button box, make him sit in a 
high chair or other secure place and string the buttons 
with a large needle, big ones on one string; small ones 
on another; black on one string; white on another; 
large white ones; large black ones; alternate black and 
white. When he can understand the number differ- 
ences, make him string the two-holed buttons on one 
string and the four-holed on another. 
Let the child sit at the table and mark around objects 
with a pencil on paper. To mark around an ink-well, 
inverted cup or saucer, glass, box, child’s hand, and 
other objects yields endless pleasure in anticipating 
what the result will look like. Let him cut out these 
self-made tracings. Such a period of productive 
occupation is worth more than one of oral instruction, 
for during it the child is quiet, composed, entertaining 
himself, teaching himself. The fewer words the 
teacher needs to use, the more the pupil will learn. 
However, drawing very small objects is not the 
best employment. Avoid exercises that are cramping 
to the fingers as tending to cramp the mind. Give
-P-A-G-E-167
  Play 159 
the child models as large as are usable, a dinner plate 
rather than a penny. As has been said, the blackboard 
is preferable to paper, yet there are times when circum- 
stances make it necessary that the child employ himself 
at a table instead of at the blackboard. 
Just before bedtime, shadow pictures are great fun. - 
It is said that shadows led to the art of drawing. Such 
simple tales as the Fox and the Grapes can easily be 
illustrated on the wall, but if you do not know how, 
ask some old-fashioned friend to show you. 
Did you ever see boys competing as to who could 
throw his cap on a boy’s head or on a peg? Throwing 
appeals to boys. Set up a board with a six-inch hole 
in it and let them try to throw a ball through this. Such 
games force children to measure with their eyes. 
There are endless variations of the building game. 
For material save up your paper boxes, cereal boxes, 
etc. Begin by placing a good-sized box for your house 
in the center of the floor and making it correspond to 
the layout of your house. Have the children designate 
front door, back door, east, and west. Other boxes 
will do for barn, woodshed, hen-house, and dog-house. 
Do not introduce buildings or other features alien to 
the child’s experience, but seek only to have him 
express in a simple way what is already in his mind, 
thus sharpening and outlining what have hitherto been 
vague, more or less blurred, impressions. 
See how much ingenuity you can get the children 
to use, always leading them to plan and make, to adapt 
as well as adopt, to make something else answer when 
they cannot get what they want. One mother uses 
corn-cobs in fence-building and for telegraph poles. 
The interior furnishing always calls for special atten-
-P-A-G-E-168
  160 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
tion. What a fine couch, for instance, can be made of 
a domino covered with a piece of gay flannel. 
Get the children to build a substantial playhouse of 
firewood or other sticks. In this house may be laid 
water-pipes, consisting of sheets of newspaper rolled 
into long cylinders, measuring an inch or so across 
the end, and kept from unrolling by tying with string 
or folding the ends in. These may be slipped into 
each other and as many used as are needed, while 
larger cylinders will do for waste pipes. If you have 
the floor space to spare, let the house stand in a corner 
and grow from day to day; otherwise, when the play- 
ing is over make the children put the boxes and other 
material in a designated place until you are ready to 
let them use it again. 
This building can be carried on for an indefinite 
time, alterations being made as fancy strikes the chil- 
dren. It has endless possibilities, leading the mind 
outward in widening circles, as the orderly work of 
their hands sets the pace. It fosters and tests con- 
structive ability and resourcefulness. You can give 
the children their first ideas of geography by this crude 
map on the floor, but do it without saying so to them. 
Do not make play burdensome by pointing out its les- 
son or its moral. 
You ask: “How shall I implant originality and 
initiative in my children?’ Heaven has implanted 
these traits in every healthy-minded child. Did you 
ever see a stupid six-year-old? Only grown people are 
stupid, in many instances made so and usually by mis- 
directed efforts to make them clever. All you need 
think about is that you do not kill originality and 
initiative by under- or over-training. You can foster
-P-A-G-E-169
  Play 161 
them by means of the right kind of playthings and 
by play which is not too closely supervised. 
Teach the children to amuse themselves with what 
lies at hand, with what they can procure and make for 
themselves, with things that do not cost money. 
Silence the everlasting “I want, I want.” Make the 
child take pleasure in making things for himself rather : 
than give him the idea that whatever he wants can be 
had for money. This one kind of lesson may mean 
the shaping of his entire future, and helps to create the 
dividing line between constructiveness and destructive- 
ness. 
Organized games which do not lead to spontaneity 
are not play. Children for whom play is scientifically 
planned with a purpose in every movement are likely 
to grow up as unimaginative and uninteresting as 
those who sponsor such instruction. That is why I 
object to the much-advertised “teaching children in 
school how to play.” 
Children need to forget themselves in the absorption 
of play. They need to plan voyages, dig canals, rear 
fine structures that tumble down all too quickly when 
a grown-up attempts to take part in the game. A few 
grown people—very few, indeed—can go back into the 
land of make-believe, but most of us bring with us 
the atmosphere of reality that is destructive to real 
play. Leave the children to themselves while the 
guardian is busy with other things near by. Then they 
will learn! A tea-party is a grand function, even if 
only cold water is served in the cups, for imagination 
will do the rest. 
Direct the play as unostentatiously as possible, leav- 
ing as much as possible to the child, for if genuine,
-P-A-G-E-170
  162 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
the impulse to play comes from within. Do not always 
be trying to show them a better way, but give them 
a chance to carry through their undertakings without 
interference in the guise of help. Let them battle 
with their difficulties, the pleasure of surmounting 
obstacles being an essential feature of all play. 
Do not be misled into assuming that repetition is 
monotonous to a child, for you have only to use your 
own eyes and senses to assure yourself that, fortunately 
for the process of learning, the little child loves it, 
loves the same toys and games day after day. 
Before undertaking to teach the child how to do a 
thing you have not done yourself, do it alone, so that 
you may better estimate the effort required, as well as 
be better prepared to show and explain it. 
If these plans and devices had no more value than 
that of keeping the little ones safe and quiet and 
happy, they would be worth while, but in truth they 
furnish instruction of an indispensable kind, for they 
train the sense of touch. 
Think, too, how your sympathetic interest in his 
play will draw your child nearer to you, how it will 
tend to make him look to you for help, advice, and 
direction in more important matters. The tender 
young plant will grope about for something stronger 
and sturdier than itself to cling to and steady itself. 
How many children have been alienated from their 
home by having to seek such help, advice, and direc- 
tion from strangers!
-P-A-G-E-171
CHAPTER IX 
WORK 
“In every work that he began, he did it with all his 
heart, and’ prospered.” 
Ar no time prior to perhaps 1850 would it have been 
considered necessary in our country to include in a 
book on education a set of reasons for training children 
to work. Parents heard at church that man is born for 
labor, and that the light of day comes to summon him 
to work, they read at home than man shall eat his bread 
in the sweat of his brow and they reverently, almost 
unconsciously, gave thanks for the blessing which was 
worded like a curse. They studied Watts, who could 
blend in a single quillful the soundest religious, moral, 
and practical philosophy, as in the passage: “For vacant 
hours move heavily, and drag rust and filth along with 
them; and ’tis full employment and a close application 
to business that is the only barrier to keep out the 
enemy and save the future man.” For a hundred years 
“Poor Richard” taught them that 
“He who by the plow would thrive, 
Must either hold the plow or drive,” 
and that if they would find treasure in their fields they 
should dig well, but take care not to dig more than 
plow-deep. They read history and biography for 
pleasure and profit, finding on every page ample con- 
firmation of their own experience and observation, that 
under personal achievement lies personal struggle.

Now, with our wonderful progressiveness these 
hitherto never-failing sources of moral instruction and 
intellectual stimulus have fallen into disuse. People 
have grown appallingly indifferent to public worship, 
the Bible has been supplanted on the reading table by 
the Sunday newspaper, Watts is read only by those 
who seek to enrich their own output with dead men’s 
thoughts, while history and biography and philosophy 
have given place to “Bringing up Father” and the 
“movies.” What, then, have parents to lean upon 
when confronted with questions as to what is good for 
their children? No man is sufficient unto himself. 
Having no directive in their minds, they turn naturally 
to the proffered doctrines of temporal expediency, 
which substitute intensity of play for work, animal 
inclination for a sense of duty. Parents and teachers 
are being deluded with such prattle as this: “Thorough- 
ness is an old-fashioned delusion”; “Education is too 
much like taking medicine ; it should be made painless” ; 
“Do not ask children to do work in which they do not 
see the practical purpose.” In order to be on the safe 
side popular lecturers say catchy things such as: 
“Education is freedom. Any pressure that would vio- 
late this should be abolished. The spirit must not be 
bound. The test of what is good for children is 
the joy with which they react to it. Never again let 
us hear of children working. Abolish farm-chores, 
housework, etc.” It naturally follows that children 
grow up with the notion that they can play through 
life, that education can be conducted on the principle 
of fascination, that the world owes them a living, in- 
cluding a self-starting automobile, that no man should 
be compelled to work hard and steadily at anything
-P-A-G-E-173
  Work 165 
that does not interest him, that the Ten Command- 
ments can very well be abridged into the compactness 
of “We should worry.” 
Weare now learning through actual experience what 
it would have been cheaper to learn from the teach- 
ings of religion and history, that following the natural 
inclinations reduces man to the level of the beasts of 
the field. The natural consequences of our trying out 
substitutes for work in the home and school and busi- 
ness world is the country’s swift approach to a state 
of degradation unparalleled since the downfall of Rome, 
unless it be in the equatorial jungles. People have gone 
mad. Our country is full of insurgents, seething with 
unrest and dissatisfaction. Everywhere there are 
strikes, divorces, lynchings, inadequate incomes, dis- 
jointed traffic, mutual distrust, open and hidden de- 
fiance of the law, lawlessness parading in the garb of 
patriotism, indescribable extravagance. The public 
sense of right and wrong is being perverted by the men 
and women who, having relapsed into pagan ways, 
trick out vices in fine phrases on the plea that what is 
beautiful cannot be harmful. Those who dare to see 
indecency in any spectacle offered by the stage or screen 
are sneered at as having evil imaginations. Intelligence 
is at such a low ebb that, as shown by the War Depart- 
ment’s tests, fifty-five per cent of 3,000,000 men in 
the prime of life and strength possess only the minds 
of children, having come to a mental standstill before 
they left the grammar school. 
This country will not become once more a good place 
to live in until men and women realize, and act upon 
the realization, that they must give an honest day’s 
work in return for a living, for freedom, safety, honor,
-P-A-G-E-174
  166 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother | 
home, and education. People have got to work, but 
grown-up idlers are not going to do it until a period of 
semi-starvation brings them to their senses. For them 
must come the horrors of the convict stone-pile, so 
burdensome and exhausting is work to those who have 
not been trained from childhood to continuous exertion. 
(None of us would work were we not driven to it by 
sheer compulsion or the blessed force of early habit. 
Working under compulsion and without a goal has 
the ignoble and slavish character of drudgery, but 
work for which we are fitted, and for which habit has 
prepared us from childhood, is the simplest natural 
solution of the problem of human happiness. The very 
exertion of physical and mental powers to the full of 
their capabilities in productive work, the conquest of 
a hard task, fills the soul with a joy far exceeding the 
delight of self-chosen play. 
There have always been sacrifices to child-labor, and 
there always will be until this globe becomes inhabited 
by a race different from any now upon it. But deplor- 
able and destructive as are the evils of overwork, they 
are not to be compared in number and extent with the 
evils of child-idleness. Because men have died of over- 
_ eating, shall we legislate against the use of food? Any 
good thing in excess becomes evil, whether work or 
play or food or courage or patriotism. 
To make a sound mind in a sound body there must 
be bodily and mental effort in due proportion. If the 
nervous system is in constant use it wears out, and 
especially is this true in children, who should be making 
strenuous physical effort if for no other reason than to 
let the nerves rest. No formal gymnastics can equal 
in health-giving value the natural bodily exercises called
-P-A-G-E-175

  Work 167 
for by house chores, the care of animals and plants, 
cultivating the ground and such regular work, espe- 
cially the kind that brings children into contact with 
Mother Earth. The need of this contact was shown in 
the well-known experiment of insulating guinea pigs 
from the influence of the earth’s magnetism, which 
resulted in their developing rickets. 
No legacy of lands and dollars can make your 
children as truly independent for life as the facility 
and willingness to do whatever comes to hand, yet this 
is a kind of priceless capital within the reach of the low- 
liest home. According to the wholesome rule among 
the Jews all children of high and low birth were 
obliged to learn some trade. Thus Christ was a car- 
penter, Paul, though versed in the literature and phi- 
losophy of Greece, became a tent-maker and at this 
trade labored for his support. Training and practice 
throughout childhood in ordinary work of house, 
garden, barn, and field are the most practical founda- 
tion for all trades and professions, as well as for the 
beginnings of homekeeping, which is a trade that in 
this life of uncertainty may very well stand between 
your children and penury. 
Even if it had no value whatever except as a kind 
of old-age insurance, it would be worth all the trouble 
of its acquisition, since it is no great burden to carry. 
Statisticians tell us that by sixty-five the majority of 
men have settled down to final failure and dependence 
upon others for support, but how many final failures 
has the reader known among men and women who 
were perseveringly and intelligently active? In time 
of stress a smattering of book-knowledge alone will 
not win an undying welcome at an alien hearth. Effi-
-P-A-G-E-176
  168 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
ciency along lines of commonplace activities will pro- 
vide a ready quid pro quo for one’s keep when personal 
misfortune leaves showier accomplishments at a dis- 
count. 
Even if your worldly circumstances are such that 
you do not need your children’s help, you are none 
the less morally bound to make them give it. Our 
Heavenly Father does not need our work, yet He sets 
us our tasks and holds us to account for our steward- 
ship. In the homes of the extremely poor the children 
get the discipline of struggle, the drill of hardship, 
without very much conscious training. This is why 
one who has risen from a lowly home to dizzy heights 
said recently, “Hunger and thirst are the way to 
heaven.” Wealthy parents should exert themselves 
to accustom their children to only the necessaries of 
life and to compel thrift, simplicity, and hard work, 
else the children are doomed to softness of body and 
mind. 
The habit of work is considerably more than the key 
- to material gain, for the ability to make money is after 
all the lowest of all practical tests of success in life. 
Things that are of enduring value in this world can- 
not be bought in the marketplace. A sense of responsi- 
bility is to the moral life what terrestrial gravitation 
is in the physical world. The well-trained mind, the 
well-balanced character, whatever a person really is, 
are closely associated with the habit of work. With it 
go muscle-making, resolution, fortitude, a readiness to 
meet untried tasks. Those parents fail in their bounden 
duty who send children from under their roof to a 
school before taking such simple and efficacious means 
of forming character as is supplied by the habit of
-P-A-G-E-177
Work 169 
work. After eighteen centuries the words of Rabbi 
Judah still keep their substance: “He who teacheth 
not his son a trade does as if he taught him to be a 
thief.” A dread of hard work sends more young 
people into lives of crime than do poverty, low wages, 
and ignorance combined, yet in the physically fit indi- 
vidual a dread of hard work springs mainly from the 
lack of the habit of work. Children are not naturally 
loafers; they realize not only profit but pleasure in 
learning and doing, and it is the business of education 
to train them during the plastic years so that their life- 
work, whatever it may be, becomes their principal 
source of pleasure. 
Education means preparation and training for work. 
If children are to be prepared for the struggle of life, 
they must be drilled to earnest, persistent effort which 
is in no way dependent on momentary impulse or 
caprice. It is not nearly enough to teach them how to ¥ 
work, for that is comparatively simple. The important 
thing is to keep them at it until the habit of working 
becomes formed. Anyone who allows them to shun 
and avoid doing the thing disliked, or who allows them 
to do everything playfully, is actually placing difficul- 
ties in the way of a naturally intelligent child’s healthy 
development. 
Many a mother lets her children run scot-free and 
does the work herself, because it is easier than keeping 
everlastingly after them to make them work, or because 
she wants them to “have things easier” than their par- 
ents had. So when Paul goes to bed without bringing 
up the coal, mother does it instead of making Paul get 
out of bed and do it. Such a mother is setting in the 
child’s way obstacles which are not naturally there and 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  170 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
which are harder to surmount than the natural ones. 
This is not love, for true love trains the child in such a 
way that no bad habits clog his attempts to rise. As 
one wise mother says, “I love my children, and I expect 
to keep on loving them in spite of anything they 
may do, even to committing murder. But I owe it to 
them to train them so that other people can at least 
tolerate them.” 
‘One thing that American children need to learn is 
to attend to their own business and to complete an 
assigned task before meddling with other things. What 
a rara avis is the boy or girl of fourteen who can go at 
a piece of work and “‘sweat over it” until it is mastered! 
How few men and women, even, can apply themselves 
assiduously for several consecutive hours to the solu- 
tion of a definite problem. To do two hours’ work 
without loafing or lagging is impossible to them, for 
they have not learned how. A few, a very few, have 
learned to sit down for ten consecutive minutes to an 
assigned mental task without wandering off rainbow- 
chasing. As proofs that Americans are retrograding, 
foreigners cite the facts that they will not stick at 
anything, they will not submit to discipline, they are 
wonderfully: clever at putting on the appearance of 
work, they are clever at guessing, and they habitually 
and unconsciously lie to themselves about their attain- 
ments and their work. If you will train a child of six 
to work steadily for fifteen minutes at one task, and 
keep this up day after day, you can lengthen the time 
the second year to thirty minutes. At this rate the 
fourteen-year-old can work for two consecutive hours 
at an assigned task without lagging or loafing. He 
will then have acquired one of the first essentials of
-P-A-G-E-179
  Work 171 
success in life, the habit of diligence, which is a better 
test of true education than is a college diploma. 
Among other reasons for the fact that European 
schoolboys are two years in advance of American 
schoolboys, Sidney G. Fisher, writing in American 
Education, has this to offer: 
“The (European) child is expected to work hard. 
Little pity is shown the dull or lazy. This severity 
seems to be enforced without the injury to health, 
which is the frequent cry in this country. 
“Human beings, young and old, were made for work; 
and when in normal health can stand with perfect im- 
punity great strains of it, or what seems to some like 
great strains. If this were not so, civilization would 
never have advanced to where it is. When in our 
normal, sound condition, fatigue is a medicine, a 
benefit, even a pleasure, and contributes enormously 
to growth and development of both body and mind.” 
In conjunction with sense-training, regular work is 
the best and safest, if not the only cure for undeveloped 
mentality. It does not take high intelligence to learn 
how to work, yet ability to work to good purpose not 
only atones in no small degree for limited intelligence, 
but it actually promotes and develops intelligence. 
Read the life of the philosopher and educational re- 
former, Friedrich Froebel. In school he passed for a 
dunce and so was apprenticed to a forester, while his 
brother was sent to the university, but at work in the 
grand old Thuringian forest he gained a profound 
insight into the laws of the universe and came forth 
at the age of seventeen, possessed not only with the 
idea of making the world a better place to live in, but  
-P-A-G-E-180
172 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
with the patience and persistence and the powerful 
mentality to accomplish his purpose. 
A man died recently in Minnesota who from the time 
he was nine until he was seventeen was known to his 
neighbors as the omadhaun, which is Gaelic for dul- 
lard, blockhead. And he was exactly that. He could 
not learn to count except on his fingers, he could not 
spell or read. On the advice of teachers he was taken 
out of school and set to work on his father’s farm, 
where he did all kinds of work, according to what was 
suitable at different stages of physical growth. He 
grew up into a powerfully built, enormously strong 
young man, and, what is most interesting, slowly 
awakened to a craving for knowledge and a belief in 
his own powers of acquiring it. Even at seventeen, 
however, he did not know the multiplication tables, 
but he had learned to figure up weights and other 
measures where hundreds, thousands, and finally 
millions were involved, doing the examples in his head 
by simple painful processes of addition or subtraction. 
As soon as his parents saw that at twenty-one he 
had actually arrived at a stage where he could learn, 
they sent him back to school. He now mastered books 
as he had mastered the horses and farm routine and 
machinery. He went through the university and 
became prominent as an educator and lecturer, and in 
the hope of helping others who might be similarly 
handicapped, wrote his autobiography, ‘“Studevan’s 
Omadhaun,” in which he lays supreme stress upon the 
value of learning through the muscles as opposed to 
mere theoretical instruction. 
Even if we look upon education from the minor 
standpoint of scholarship, common sense tells us that
-P-A-G-E-181
Work 173 
it is impossible of attainment without long laborious 
preparation, for while the facts themselves may be 
acquired by a knack of memory, the ability to deal 
sagaciously with facts is in practically every case the 
outcome of the mother’s patience and perseverance in 
making children do the same thing exactly so day after 
day. It is this making which is the backbone of educa- 
tion. It supplements schooling or supplies the lack of 
schooling. Children who are trained to work at the 
common tasks of life make far more rapid and sound 
intellectual advancement than pampered children who 
have only a casual attitude towards responsibility. 
Time and again the author has undertaken to instruct 
children of ten or older who had never received any 
primary schooling but who, owing either to necessity 
or the good sense of their parents, had been drilled to 
work and trained to a satisfactory degree of responsi- 
bility. Without a single exception these pupils learned 
in months what school children ordinarily dawdle over 
for years. While one may conclude from this that 
children are the gainers for deferring book-instruction 
longer than is done at present it would be unsafe to stop 
with this deduction, for when children have idled away 
ten or twelve years at home or elsewhere, it is no longer 
in the power of the best teacher to teach them anything 
worth while. 
What was true in the case of the pupils referred to 
‘will be found true in general: children who learn to 
work with their hands, who can persist in laborious 
effort until obstacles are overcome, who rejoice in the 
finished task, have had the best kind of preparation to 
succeed in books. The mastery of every new bit of 
manual work, no matter how simple, means an increase
-P-A-G-E-182
174. Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
of mental acuteness as well as of manual cleverness. In 
the order of Nature, physical work comes before men- 
tal work, the hand should be trained before the brain 
is taxed. With the right foundation of training for 
practical application, the teaching from books becomes 
unbelievably easy, because when suitable mental tasks 
are then imposed or self-imposed, their performance 
is assured by the will power previously acquired. This 
is one reason why the children of unlettered parents 
have often risen to great moral and intellectual heights, 
for the parents, in doing what they knew was good 
for soul and body, were unknowingly doing the very 
things that were best for the mind. High scholarship 
crowned their efforts, but the crown of the crown was 
strong character and wisdom, which are the sanctified 
correlatives of the will to overcome obstacles and the 
ability to keep at a hard assignment to the point of 
accomplishment. 
It is a mistake to turn work into an amusement, but 
for all that, it is the state of mind in which work is 
done that determines its value to the doer. Work in 
the right proportion, done in the right spirit, is whole- 
some and educative, while overwork, unsuitable work, 
work to which we are not properly trained, work that 
is slavish or degrading in the mind of the doer, is 
drudgery, unwholesome and uneducative. Whether the 
children’s daily round of household duties is work or 
drudgery depends upon circumstances within the con- 
trol of healthy-minded parents. If parents proceed on 
the assumption that it is a real misfortune to get up 
early and work late at some untidy form of manual 
employment, or if they speak enviously of those who 
toil not, or pridefully of their acquaintance with the
-P-A-G-E-183
  Work 175 
idle rich, you may be sure that their children will whine 
and sulk and shirk and resist to the uttermost the daily 
necessary grind. 
How different it is in the well-guided home. The 
mother knows that in each child is an original power 
that can become a constructive force only through 
being exerted, even as the lily of the valley can develop 
its sweet blossoms only if the roots have been sub- 
jected to frost. She remembers the poet’s words: 
“Before knowledge the gods have placed sweat.” 
She therefore puts aside weak sentimentality and reso- 
lutely schools her children for life in a world that is 
ruled by “You must,” not by “I want.” 
Because activity is the law of child nature, it is easy 
and natural for the mother to teach and enforce phys- 
ical work. Like a wise engineer she does not seek to 
check the mountain torrent, but rather guides it within 
safe limits and utilizes it. Instead of forever nagging 
children to be good or quiet, she keeps them so busy 
that they have little time to be naughty. She begins 
this training in the pretty, easy, natural way of parent 
birds teaching their nestlings to fly. Watch how the 
old birds lift the wings of the young ones to try their 
strength, and to make them exert themselves. A short 
flight, a rest, another short flight, another rest, encour- 
aging cries in midflight—thus the little wings grow 
stronger. ; 
The foundation of the work habit is the habit of 
ready and willing obedience to the parents. Give chil- 
dren daily drill for the express purpose of enabling 
them to respond quickly and intelligently to commands 
and directions. Such drills are to the mind and body 
what tuning is to the master’s violin. Make the little 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
176 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
child come to you, stand quietly in front of you, look 
you in the eye while you give a single definite instruc- 
tion such as: 
“Place this book on the dining-room table.” 
“Go to the kitchen, get the dustpan and bring it 
to me.” 
“Get the dustcloth and wipe the dust off this chair.” 
“Now put the cloth again where it belongs.” 
Use judgment in assigning tasks. Do not give things 
which are impossible to do, or without sufficient instruc- 
tion and drill, for you break the child’s courage when 
you allow him to consider himself a failure. Find out 
what he should be able to do, teach him how to do it, 
then make him do it regularly, punctually, and exactly. 
Be sure that the tasks are not too long, but so short 
and so simple that the child can see to the end of them 
and by keeping at work can complete them within a 
reasonable time. Such tasks for a child of four to 
six are: setting and clearing the table, as far as it can 
be intrusted to her, carrying fuel in limited amounts, 
feeding chicks, helping you with dishes, bedmaking, 
sweeping. A part of every day should be spent in this 
way, more work being added from season to season. 
Although the daily schedule should be observed, the 
child should do special work in special work-seasons, 
just as older people must. That is what life is like. 
If you are not doing your own work it is a little more 
difficult to plan suitably, for the child learns best by 
helping with the parents’ daily labors, doing the drip- 
pings of grown-up work. 
Do not allow children to undertake work beyond 
their powers. This does not mean that they are to be 
entirely shielded from failure and disappointment, for
-P-A-G-E-185
  Work 177 
everyone needs the discipline that comes from failure 
as well as from success. If the boy has a scheme for 
coaxing water uphill by easy stages, or strapping wings 
on his shoulders for a short flight around the neigh- 
borhood, or digging a hole through the back yard into 
China, or similar enterprises calculated to overcome 
the force of gravity, let him alone except when serious 
risk is involved. Let him discover through toilsome 
experimentation, rather than through words, that cer- 
tain things are not done in the human world. But if 
his ambition to help you should stir him to propose 
weeding the whole garden or transferring a load of 
coal into the bin or any such task to which the hin- 
drance is his own weakness and immaturity, forbid it. 
Weeding four square feet of garden or carrying ten 
little buckets of coal is work for a six-year-old. Weed- 
ing forty square feet or carrying one hundred buckets 
of coal would be drudgery. Limit his undertakings 
to those whose goal is within his sight and from which 
he can therefore learn the joy of the finished task. 
In the choice of work, do not consult the child’s 
whims, but ask yourself: “Is this worth while for the 
child?” ‘You know what is good for him and he does 
not know, so assign his tasks and keep him to them. 
It is all very fine to talk about children doing their best 
work when they are interested, but no child is enthusi- 
astic about work after the novelty wears off, and self- 
chosen tasks become irksome even more quickly than 
those laid on by authority. Your quest is not to find 
out what is most agreeable to the child but what will 
best prepare him for a happy future. You should not 
omit work because it is hard, if it is within the capacity 
of the child, and you must bring steady pressure to 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  178 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
bear to compel regular work. The child will acquire 
sufficient interest as soon and as long as you keep him 
to a regular schedule, require him to be at all times 
obedient, polite, and respectful, and give him only tasks 
that are neither above nor below his strength and 
understanding. Make each child do each day a set 
number of set things, such as carrying wood, drying 
dishes, watering chickens, and the like. Never overdo 
these things, for virtue carried to excess becomes a 
vice. The little child should not be burdened, still less 
overburdened and overtaxed. Such tasks as the above, 
with a few similar ones added from season to season, 
are not burdensome but wholesome. 
A certain number of well-planned, regular tasks are 
much more educational and disciplinary, than un- 
planned, erratic help, such as running errands. A 
child should of course run errands, but beware that 
this is not carried to extremes and abused. Doing it 
for father and mother should be about the limit, for 
others are apt to abuse the privilege of having your 
children fetch and carry for them. A child should 
never run an errand for anybody without his parents’ 
express permission. Personally, I should strongly 
object to the acceptance of money by children as a rec- 
ompense for occasional errands for neighbors, but if 
the errands are run for a business, it is an entirely 
different matter. 
Plan a full day. When you think how many thou- 
sand steps a child takes in playing during the day, you 
will realize that activity does not harm, but benefits 
him. A considerable part of this activity should be 
spent in a consciously useful direction. 
Make children do their work before they are let
-P-A-G-E-187
  W ork 179 
loose to play. A three-minute task postponed from 
morning until afternoon is more dreaded by a child of 
eight, and more exhausting to him, than two hours’ 
work the first thing in the morning. 
The simple daily tasks to be taught first are such as 
dusting a chair, sweeping the porch or sidewalk, 
watering the plants, standing the books up on a shelf, 
and so on. They should be adapted to the surround- 
ings and home conditions. Show how to do the task, 
explain it several times if necessary, then make the 
child follow your example and make him do it right. 
Teach children to look forward to helping you, not 
to your helping them. 
From the age of three every child should have a 
garden, if only a tomato can or box with quick-growing 
seeds. He should help any member of the household 
working in the garden and feel that his help is of some 
importance to the family. 
Make the child help himself. Of course it is much 
more troublesome to teach a child how to do a thing 
than to do it yourself, and this is the real cause of 
many a mother’s remissness. See that you do not 
do things for him that he is able to do for himself. 
When he says, “I can’t,” show him that he can, unless 
it be something not suitable for him to do. See him 
smile when he has to acknowledge that he can do some- 
thing that seemed hard to him, or that he pretended 
was beyond his powers. Even a child of four can 
brush, not blacken, his own boots. By doing this when- 
ever it has to be done, even if you have to finish the 
job, he realizes that it has to be done and he will 
gradually learn to do it right. Such things as laying 
each garment just where it belongs when it is removed, 
 
-P-A-G-E-188
180 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
are suitable and necessary for a young child to do. 
Demonstrate this each time until he has learned. 
Make the child an independent worker; accustom 
him to work without help, by leaving him every day a 
piece of work to complete by himself. Plan lessons for 
this particular purpose, not new things so much as 
enlarging and extending previous lessons. The longer 
you can keep a child working industriously by himself 
the better, for it means that he is learning how to 
learn. If he makes progress along this line with one 
kind of task be satisfied for the day, even if he seems 
to learn nothing along other lines. 
Good work calls for thoroughness, but thoroughness 
is impossible without long drill in carefulness and 
should not be expected of young children. It is less 
important for a young child to do things than it is to 
keep trying, for the effort is what counts most. Be 
satisfied with the best they can do, keeping in mind 
their age, understanding, and practice. 
You should give only such tasks as you yourself 
can supervise. Do not tell the child to do something 
unless you intend to follow it up and see that he has 
done it properly, for it is the following up that counts. 
Teach him respect for the finished job and show your 
pleasure over honest effort. 
Give certain tasks that the child is able to do as 
exactly right as a grown person could. Such tasks for 
a child of five are: Putting out milk bottles in a certain 
place, placing silver on the table correctly, setting chairs 
at table, placing a rug, straightening books on a shelf, 
drying silver and a few dishes, dusting a table or chair, 
weeding a clearly marked piece of earth a foot or so 
square. 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
Work 181 
Sometimes a mother says: “I make my boy get the 
coal for me in little buckets, but he does so very reluc- 
tantly.” In such cases, you must drive out the bad 
habit of resistance to authority with a good habit of 
yielding to necessity. Getting the fuel is an eminently 
suitable task for a healthy child, and if he is not healthy, 
it is one of the best things to improve his health. Make 
this a part of his daily work, from which he is at no 
time to be excused except for illness. Do not scold 
or nag but use compulsion when necessary, and after 
a while, the inevitableness of it will impress him so 
that he unconsciously yields to circumstances. The 
habit becomes second nature and therefore agreeable. 
Even young children may very well help to destroy 
house-flies, thus assisting to protect health and pro- 
mote the comfort of the family. Each member of the 
family should help to set the good example. 
A girl of six should be learning how to make a bed 
properly ; how to do the very simplest household duties. 
She should be, as she probably is, a very busy child. 
The child of seven or older should have some care 
of a younger child. Set aside a certain time each day 
for this, half an hour or so. Taking care of Baby 
indefinitely is not suitable for a child, as it is a seem- 
ingly endless task and is bound to be hated as such, 
but it is entirely appropriate to require a child of six 
to play with little brother during the half hour, more 
or less, when you have something else to do each day. 
It is a kindergarten lesson of the most valuable kind. 
When you are sewing or knitting, have the seven- 
year-old sit down beside you and learn to sew on but- 
tons, to knit ridges, and to do plain sewing with large 
stitches. To knit a scarf for her doll in her favorite
-P-A-G-E-190
182 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
shade is suitable occupation. A two-inch scarf, four 
to six inches long, is best, so that its completion will 
not be too long delayed. Do not let her knit too long 
at a time, and call her attention to the fact that “One 
stitch and then another, and the longest scarf is ended.” 
Do the setting up for her and do not teach her anything 
but the garter stitch. 
Do not allow the child to sew steadily at kindergar- 
ten cards, or to do other close work, of that kind, the 
danger of eye-strain and its harmful results outweigh- 
ing the possible good. Sewing buttons on a strip of 
cloth, or sewing in large stitches with thick thread or 
yarn and large needles is safer. To learn the simple 
and safe handling of needle, thimble, and scissors 
should be the aim at this early age, an aim that is 
interfered with as soon as the element of showiness 
enters. Think of the danger to a little child’s morality, 
when she proudly exhibits as the result of her own 
work a piece of embroidery on a punctured card, 
whereas, as a rule, not even the purely mechanical part 
of it is hers. 
When working in the garden, put living interest into 
the work. Impress the children with ideas of the enor- 
mous damage done to crops by such enemies as weeds, 
insects, and marauding birds. Teach them about the 
potato-beetle in all stages of development and with the 
children’s help, fight him on his own ground. In doing 
this, it is safe to rouse the spirit of competition in 
fighting evil: In half an hour who can gather in an old 
tomato-can the most beetles for incineration? Or have 
each member of the party start at one end of a row 
and capture each beetle in that row, mother inspecting 
the results. And who can bring in most carefully-
-P-A-G-E-191
  Work 183 
plucked potato-plant leaves, each bearing on its under 
side an egg-colony ? 
Father and mother must lend encouragement by giv- 
ing due credit for honest childish efforts. Baby’s sat- 
isfied “There!” when she sees your ceremonious de- 
struction of the two beetles from her tomato-can will 
show you the educational value of encouraging honest 
effort, however crude. 
Work against time in such undertakings as weeding, 
bugging, dishwashing, for then the task takes on the 
features of a lark. Take the alarm clock to the garden 
and set it to ring in half an hour, and have everyone 
work to see who will get the most done—to beat the 
clock. Call attention to the improved appearance of a 
weedless garden, and stir up pride in having the best 
weeded garden of your whole neighborhood. 
If the child of five or older has not been trained in 
helpfulness make no drastic change, but patiently set 
about teaching him to perform one simple task. Do 
not undertake several new things in the same week or 
month, but only how to do that one thing as well as 
he can, then make him do it regularly and promptly. 
After a short but adequate time, perhaps a week or 
month, add another task. Continue in this way, at 
the same time keeping up the previous daily require- 
ments and getting more exacting with these. 
Here are such tasks as I would suggest for every 
day when the beginning is being made as well as those 
previously mentioned for a child of five: Bringing in 
the milk, dusting down the stairs or dusting the dining- 
room chairs, sweeping the porch, bringing the vegeta- 
bles you require for the kitchen. 
If any of these are not suitable in his case, substitute
-P-A-G-E-192
  184 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
others that meet the present conditions. Give only 
necessary tasks that imply real help, no whimsical, in- 
vented, useless tasks! Setting the table, using broom, 
dustcloth, dish-towel, hunting flowers and putting them 
in water, tidying a room, tidying the yard, feeding and 
watering chickens, hunting eggs, pulling weeds—there 
is no end of suitable tasks in each home for children of 
every age. Even one month of strict adherence to a 
well-ordered program, with its attendant tasks, its 
requirement of prompt obedience, will show you a 
striking improvement in a hitherto troublesome child.

CHAPTER X 
RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 
Wbo is to blame for moral crookedness? In olden 
days, when religion was placed first instead of second, 
third, or nowhere, in education, the responsibility was 
placed on the parents. Then came the scientists, who 
led us to believe that if a child was born with a certain 
height of brow or length of nose or setting of eyes or 
ears or periphery of jaw, he was marked as a fore- 
ordained lawbreaker. Now, to our relief, the experts 
who in an effort to establish a physical criminal type, 
for twenty years have been measuring faces in Eng- 
land, have given up the attempt, declaring that there 
is no such type and that they find about the same varia- 
tion of feature among honest men as among rogues. 
Now and then a psychologist cautiously asserts that 
there are few born criminals. Let us go farther and 
say that, among the physically and mentally normal, 
there is no such thing as a born criminal. We hear of 
born artists and born poets and born teachers, but 
which of them ever painted a fine picture or wrote a 
great poem or taught a good lesson while his qualifica- 
tions were still limited to the gifts of nature? Neither 
does one embark on a career of lawlessness without a 
preparatory course. Parents cannot escape responsi- 
bility by blaming a child’s naughtiness on some remote 
ancestor. Criminals are not born, but made, neither 
morals nor manners are hereditary, and right and 
wrong have both to be learned. 
185
-P-A-G-E-194
  186 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
The ill-guided home is mainly responsible for the 
lowering of moral standards and the decay of the 
national conscience. As Dean Jones of Yale Univer- 
sity says: “It is astonishing how much faith many 
parents have that Divine Providence will bring up their 
children. We are approaching a moral crisis, nor do 
I think we can avoid it by educating.” 
If by educating, Dean Jones means schooling, indeed 
we cannot avoid the crisis, for as our great educational 
reformer, Froebel, warned us: “All education not 
founded on religion is unproductive.” Our schools 
are godless, one result of instrusting them with the 
entire process of education being that we have mul- 
titudes of grown men and women who have no intelli- 
gent sense of what is right and wrong. We have 
entered on an epoch when moral instruction is needed 
as it never was needed before, not morals based on a 
vague, man-made code, but on the Ten Command- 
ments and the precepts of the Gospel. Parents who 
want to have good children without giving them relig- 
ious education are trying to build a superstructure 
without a foundation. “Seek ye first the kingdom of 
God” is the aim of all true education, and if the world 
is to escape the horrors of a new Dark Ages it must 
return to the true philosophy based on religious belief. 
Nothing will carry boys and girls safely through 
moral perils except faith in God, who punishes the 
breakers of His law and rewards the observers. Un- 
less children are taught to regard all their thoughts, 
words, and actions in the light of an eternity of pain 
and happiness, they become men and women for whom 
self-restraint is impossible. 
Young Americans are undeniably clever, but when
-P-A-G-E-195
    Religious Education 187 
they are given all the so-called advantages of schooling 
and have no religion as a directive of their minds, they 
may justly be regarded as mere educated animals. 
Their brains are sharpened to the doing of two things, 
making money and having a good time. 
Religion originally meant an obligation or restraint 
imposed upon men by an unseen supreme power, bind- 
ing them to have a care in all their actions, an idea 
which is abridged into the old proverb, which tells us 
that a man without religion is like a horse without a 
bridle. Even to-day, it is religion that makes man 
duly submissive to the laws of the land, not simply 
from the fear of punishment but by the restraint of 
conscience. The too-famous Voltaire, though a de- 
stroyer of established law and religion, acknowledged 
this when he said, “Society without religion would be 
but a den of ferocious beasts.” 
Religion is essential to a people’s very existence, a 
striking example of which fact is given us by the 
Hebrews, who faithfully followed this conception for 
thousands of years. From the very time of their 
sojourn in the desert, they had the books of Moses, 
they read them every day, and fathers transmitted to 
their children the knowledge they contained as the most 
precious inheritance they could leave them, while the 
children were required to learn the laws of God and to 
write them on leaves or on sand. The people were so 
convinced of the authenticity of the sacred writings 
that they accepted in all their strictness the laws and 
punishments therein contained. 
Far from irreverence or irreligion being an indica- 
tion of strength of mind or touch of genius, it is quite 
the reverse, for there is no evidence of reverence among 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  188  Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
the feeble-minded, and great poets and painters have 
ever gone to religion for their inspiration. Strip the 
religious element from the poetry of Dante, Shake- 
speare, or even of Homer and Virgil, and nothing 
remains but the rigidity of the scaffolding. Even 
Wordsworth’s greatest poetic charm lies in his concep- 
tion of Nature as the garment of the living God. Leave 
unpainted and unhewn those masterpieces of Raphael, 
Michael Angelo, da Vinci, Giotto, executed for the 
glory of God, and what remains is good workmanship 
but workmanship no longer eloquent of the animating 
spirit in whose power the workman wrought. The 
agnostic is not only incapable of creating a work of 
genius, but he is incapable of appreciating it. What 
we find in a work of art depends upon what we bring 
to it, and if a man cannot rise to the contemplation of 
the unseen in religion, he cannot do so in art. What 
can the worldling see in Michael Angelo’s kneeling angel 
beyond the artist’s marvelous knowledge of anatomical 
development and his extraordinary facility of execu- 
tion? 
The child comes into the world with many good 
qualities of mind and body still dormant, and rever- 
ence, the greatest of them, must be awakened and ten- 
derly cultivated. That is the alpha and omega of true 
education in early childhood, the period of tender faith. 
Later, though the individual may come to realize what 
he has been denied through early neglect, and though 
his understanding may assent to the propositions set 
before it, he nevertheless finds himself unable to feel 
the unseen as a reality. ‘He shall die without instruc- 
tion, and in the greatness of his folly he shall go 
astray.” On the other hand, the trusting heart of
-P-A-G-E-197
  Religious Education 189 
childhood readily lays hold of spiritual truth and is 
readily disposed to the reception of faith, “the sub- 
stance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not 
seen.” Faith, therefore, should be established early. 
It does not conflict with reason, but is above and 
beyond it, for faith has no limits and is strong, whereas 
reason has limits and is weak. Because God wills it 
so! makes it easier for us in all ways. 
If a mother—which God forbid—lacks faith, she 
must either acquire it or else leave all that pertains to 
religious teaching to the priest or minister or some 
other competent and dependable person, and she must 
rigorously abstain from any adverse criticism, from 
any disparaging remark that has the least suspicion of 
scoffing in it, for ““whoso shall offend one of these little 
ones which believe in me, it were better that a mill- 
stone were hanged about his neck, and that he were 
drowned in the depths of the sea.” 
Let the mother whose early religious training was 
neglected set about overcoming her handicap. In this, 
her children’s needs will be her greatest help. Get a 
catechism, a good Bible history, a Bible, subscribe for 
a good church periodical, and place yourself under the 
guidance of your spiritual adviser. Work and pray 
for direction, as Monica worked and prayed for her 
son’s salvation, attend church regularly, attend Sunday 
school and study how to adapt the lessons to your home 
instruction, and you will succeed. 
Between the ages of three and seven your children 
should be grounded in these essentials: Belief that there 
is a Supreme Being; that He is a living, personal God; 
that He has created everything that exists, and yet is 
our good Father, who knows us and loves us; that He
-P-A-G-E-198
  190 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
will judge all human beings by the law of love which 
He taught mankind; that God forgives the sins of 
repentant souls; that our souls are immortal souls; that 
it is our duty to pray to God as to a loving Father; 
that if we show devotion and faith, we may hope for 
God’s grace to keep us from sin. It takes years to 
teach this creed and a lifetime to learn it. Teach these 
young children also the Lord’s Prayer, the Golden 
Rule, and the Twenty-third Psalm, beginning “The 
Lord is my Shepherd.” This much done, you have 
laid the foundation for instruction in the particular 
doctrines of your own church. 
Real success, that is the consciousness of having 
lived a helpful, God-fearing life, will not fail your 
children if you establish early a becoming sense of 
humility, an understanding of our limitations, a will- 
ingness to be taught, and the habit of first submitting 
to discipline and then disciplining yourself. God makes 
the tree grow as it does, and He makes us grow as we 
do, only we are much more wonderful than the tree, 
because we have a soul that will live in another world, 
and because we have something inside of us, our con- 
science, that tells us what is right and what is not 
right. Bring up your children so that they will never 
disregard the “still, small voice.’ But without direct 
instruction they cannot know about conscience, about 
right and wrong, or rise in the scale of understanding. 
Do not force or overdo such instruction, but let it 
come naturally when time and place seem fitting. When 
the right opportunity offers itself, when your child 
seems receptive for a deep and lasting impression, then 
speak of God’s care of His children. Such teaching, 
coming from the mother, will have a much greater
-P-A-G-E-199
  Religious Education IgI 
effect than hearing the identical words in Sunday 
school. Impress on the child by your whole manner 
that you, yourself, believe what you say, or, rather, 
that you feel it and have faith in it. 
How happy is the child whose tasks are lightened, 
whose temptations are overcome, whose day is bright- 
ened by daily prayer! ‘Prayer is the key of morning 
and the bolt of night.” Not only morally, but mentally 
and physically, is prayer the portal and the direct way 
to sanity, goodness, and happiness. At a meeting of 
the British Medical Association in 1906 a distinguished 
physician said: “As an alienist and one whose life has 
been concerned with the sufferings of the mind, I would 
state that of all hygienic measures known to counteract 
disturbed sleep, depressed spirits, and all of the miser- 
able sequels of a distressed mind, the first place should 
be given to simple, regular prayer. Such a habit does 
more to calm the spirit and strengthen the soul to over- 
come emotionalism than any other remedial agent 
known to me.” 
Begin by teaching your child a simple prayer, to be \ 
said regularly before going to bed, reverently kneeling, 
although if the mother herself is not sincere in praying, 
this should be omitted. Any substitution of so-called 
moral instruction would be fatal, for morals spring 
from religion, not religion from morals. A short 
story from the Bible, told in the mother’s own words, 
should precede the prayer. These stories should be 
gradually lengthened. They should be told in such a 
way that the child can draw his own conclusions. Leave 
moralizing out altogether. If the child asks questions, 
such as: “Does that story mean such and such a thing?” 
and if he is right, the mother should not go into rap-
-P-A-G-E-200
192 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
tures over his brightness and glorify him, but should 
show her pleasure simply by petting or kissing him. 
Such encouragement is wholesome. 
Teach the Lord’s Prayer. Say it aloud while the 
children kneel devoutly. Do not as yet give them 
explanations and do not countenance questions. Say 
the prayer from the depths of your heart, as an invoca- 
tion to God rather than for the purpose of making 
children memorize. It is true that young children do 
not understand the whole of this, the prayer of pray- 
ers, yet from hearing you say it devoutly they will 
through feeling learn intuitively, which is the right 
way. For the heart must be cultivated before the head. 
A child of three is not too young to pray “Our Father,” 
and to learn that He is the Father of all; “Who art in 
Heaven,” and he will never weary of hearing about 
Heaven; “Hallowed be Thy Name,” and if he asks 
questions tell him that the name is holy and that when 
this name is mentioned every knee should bow. 
With regard to praying, it is difficult to find out what 
notion a child may have got into his head when he 
does such a thing as refuse to say a certain prayer; 
possibly he misunderstands its meaning. I have known 
children, for example, to refuse to ask for daily bread 
unless there was butter on it. Do not use compulsion 
in this matter, but simply say the prayer devoutly 
aloud, allowing the child to join in. Compulsion must 
of necessity be used in other directions, where your 
commands can be enforced; but do not single out this 
particular as the point on which you will undertake 
to enforce obedience, for you cannot very well suc- 
ceed, and besides it is not the subject to choose for a 
lesson. Do not urge or insist but quietly and earnestly 
  ‘
-P-A-G-E-201
Religious Education 193 
say the prayer for him each night; in this way he will 
be led to think with you and say it with you. 
Do not worry about a child’s half-saying his pray- 
ers. He cannot yet feel what the words mean, or know 
the need or the good of it, but all these things will be 
learned through intuition, rather than tuition, simply 
through hearing your own heartfelt appeal to God. 
You are teaching by example and feeling will be com- 
municated. Do not talk about saying or not saying 
prayers with earnestness, for to do so when the feeling 
is not there would not be genuine. Just keep on ear- 
nestly yourself and the rest will take care of itself. 
Before he can know what prayer is he must learn to 
know and feel God’s power through seeing its every- 
day manifestations on every hand. 
Make the children understand that “our daily bread” 
means food, which God sends. For our good He sends 
the calves and lambs and chickens, the grain which they 
see grow, the honey that the bees make, the water to 
the spring, the milk to the cows, all for His children. 
Talk often about the power and goodness and wisdom 
of God. Lead the child to observe intimately the beau- 
tiful outdoors, making him see that God has provided 
even for the birds of the air and the beasts of the field. 
Tell him that God makes the sun rise in the morning to 
give us light and warmth for our work, and that He 
makes it go down at night so that we may rest for 
another day’s work; that He makes the garden grow 
and the flowers blossom and the birds sing for our 
use and happiness and benefit. 
When children realize that God paints the heavens 
in glowing sunset colors, and that man could not do 
this, they will be ready to accept other equal mysteries.
-P-A-G-E-202

Constantly point out such things and so lift them up 
from the grossness which is all too common among 
those with whom they must soon associate. Such lofty 
ideas are stimulating to the imagination and will help 
to keep them away from sordid ways of looking at 
things and from mean overvaluation of themselves and 
their powers. One of the best safeguards against temp- . 
. tation is to fill the lives of children with the wonders 
and beauty surrounding them, so that there is no room 
for mean little thoughts to develop. 
I would tell the children that the wisest men that 
ever lived did not know what gave the odor to the rose 
or the color to the tiniest green leaf. When the Queen 
of Sheba asked Solomon to tell which was the natural 
wreath and which the artificial, he lifted the curtain and 
let in a swarm of bees, wiser than he in this respect, 
and they went at once to the real flowers. As I told my 
pupils the other day, we give little thought to the noisy 
sparrow in the yard—he is common, commonplace— 
yet the wisest man that ever lived could not make the 
tiniest feather on that sparrow’s wing, or give life to 
the poor worm thoughtlessly crushed under foot. These 
stories never grow old, yet as a foundation for success- 
ful teaching there is nothing so potent as the spirit of 
reverence and humility engendered by earnest talks on 
such subjects. That “God made everything” does not 
reach the child’s consciousness until he has been taught 
this lesson a thousand times about one thing after 
another, this flower, that flower, the trees, the animals, 
the children and the grown people, the moon and the 
sun and the green old earth itself. The child slowly 
learns to meditate on these things and his mind becomes 
wonderfully enriched,
-P-A-G-E-203
  Religious Education 195 
Talk to the older children about time and eternity; 
try in simple ways to give them an idea of infinity, how 
more years have come and gone than there are drops 
of water in the sea, and, whether this world continues 
to last or not, more years will come than there are 
grains of sand upon the shore. There remains nothing 
for us but the humble acknowledgment of our inability 
to comprehend infinity. Time and space are God’s. 
This a child can understand. 
Try to answer reasonable questions in a simple and 
suitable manner, but do not try to explain to a child 
things that are beyond his understanding. It is a canon 
of modern pedagogics that everything a child takes it 
into his head to quiz you about must be explained to 
him fully and frankly and quite immediately; there 
are to be no more mysteries to childhood, but every- 
thing must be naked and open to the eye. Such doc- 
trine, however, is as unnatural and dangerous as it is 
unpleasant and foolish. Every intelligent child asks 
questions every day about things utterly beyond a 
child’s understanding, as well as about things that no- 
body can account for and things that are none of his 
rightful business to know. From curiosity and habit, 
What and Why are on the tip of his tongue from morn- 
ing to night. 
Paul says: “Mother, what is electricity?” Of course 
you do not know, so you conscientiously take down a 
volume of your new Compendium of Universal Knowl- 
edge, guaranteed by the book-agent to meet just such 
questioning emergencies, and begin reading him the 
discourse on electricity, which opens with a catchy 
comment on the well-known effect of rubbing the black 
cat’s back. Like a flash Paul is off on the endless sub-
-P-A-G-E-204
| 196 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
ject of cats. Back you lead him to the matter in hand, 
thinking to give him some notion of conductors and 
nonconductors, but this merely diverts him to the enter- 
taining subject of trolley crews. Once more you de- 
tach him and think to fasten in his mind an electrical 
term or two, like positive and negative, but he inter- 
rupts your statements this time with a demand for an 
ice-cream cone. 
This example will do for a type of children’s ques- 
tions that cannot be answered by definition or detailed 
discussion without still further obscuring the subject. 
Both subject and explanation are beyond a child’s com- 
prehension. You cannot resort to the common method 
of defining, which is to use terms more simple than 
the thing defined, as in the case of telling the child 
that a quadruped is a four-footed animal, for what is 
known of electricity must needs be expressed in terms 
understandable only to a fairly mature mind. Further- 
more, language is still so new to the child that whatever 
familiar terms you do use bulk so large as to deflect his 
mind from the original subject and send it darting 
hither and yon. ‘You cannot even compare it with 
things familiar to him, like comparing the tiger with 
the house-cat, because the only possible comparison is 
with things beyond the reach of his intellect and acces- 
sible to him only by intuition. It is a mystery and must 
remain so for the present, no matter how faithfully we 
strive to render it plain. 
Do not pretend to explain, but take the opportunity 
to teach him a lesson of great moment. Tell him that 
it is something that he is too young to understand; 
that grown people know something about it but not 
everything; that he must wait until he is older for an
-P-A-G-E-205
  Religious Education 197 
explanation, and that even then, no matter how wise 
he may become, he will not know all there is to know 
about it until he gets to the next world, where all things 
are made plain. 
“O daisy mine, what will it be to look 
From God’s side even on such a simple thing.” 
Tell him that this is true of many familiar things 
about us, like a big tree growing from a little seed, or 
a little live bird coming out of its shell, or a soap bubble 
showing rainbow colors in the sun. We observe such 
things and have names for them and make some use of 
them, but though wise men have spent their lives in 
trying to unravel it, the mystery remains. We can 
only know that these things are part of God’s great 
plan for His children. Supposing that after a lesson 
on how trees grow, the child asks the perfectly reason- 
able question: “Do we grow from the inside, like 
trees?” To this, answer “Yes,” and then continue as 
with the still more abstruse question on electricity, 
telling him that he is too young to understand how 
this is. If you impress this lesson on children it will 
overcome the propensity to contradict and to require 
a proof for every statement you make. Modern par- 
ents and up-to-date teachers are all too prone to foster 
the disputatious tendencies of children by giving an 
explanation for everything and anything, although 
they feel in their hearts that it is almost sacrilegious to 
pretend to be able to do so. No wonder the modern 
child has no doubt or hesitation about anything, and 
that there is no department of human knowledge in 
which he is not better qualified to pronounce judgment 
than men who have made it their lifelong study. 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
  198 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
Far from undertaking to explain everything to chil- 
dren, you cannot implant too early in their minds the 
seeds of a consciousness that very narrow and immov- 
able limitations have all-wisely been set to all human 
knowledge and understanding. The great minds who, 
though well equipped by many years of earnest quest 
and untiring research, boldly and confidently set out 
to find the Truth, have finally to say with the great 
physicist du Bois-Reymond, “Jgnorabimus, we shall 
not know.” The sooner you make a child realize that 
even grown-up people cannot understand everything, 
the sooner will he content himself with the thought that 
most things surpass a child’s understanding. And such 
a feeling of wholesome and invigorating humility will 
in no way interfere with the striving after Truth. Just 
so, those who truly strive to live the ideal life are 
those who all the time realize most clearly their human 
frailty and shortcomings and the impossibility of reach- 
ing that goal of perfection. 
If the greatest scientists can openly confess their 
inability to explain the most common and apparently 
simple things, why should not you, teacher-mothers, 
inspire your children to have faith where they can 
never in this world know? Christ said to His disci- 
ples: “I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye 
cannot bear them now.” What arrogance there is in 
our everlasting Why! Who are we with our little 
minds that we should conquer the mysteries of God 
Himself? Read in Isaiah: “As the heavens are higher 
than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, 
and my thoughts than your thoughts.” 
Mothers often say: “I always tell my children the 
exact truth about everything they ask.” Now, mothers,
-P-A-G-E-207
  Religious Education 199 
do not be misled into imagining that you must tell 
them only the truth, as adults use that word. It would 
be too strong meat for them, and besides, it is not in 
your power to tell them the truth, for not the words you 
may use constitute truth, but the effect of these words 
on the mind of the hearer. When you are talking with 
your husband you can estimate fairly closely the effect 
that certain language, certain statements, will have on 
him, the way in which his mind will react to your 
words, the meanings he will deduce. But when you 
tall to a child or a stranger or a person from an entirely 
different walk of life and, therefore, different mode of 
thought, you cannot so well judge of the inferences 
that will be drawn. By means of language you are 
trying to convey certain notions, but if the hearer 
miscomprehend your language, Heaven only knows 
what you may seem to say. This does not mean that 
you should discourage the child’s asking questions— 
far from it. His questions are the only dependable 
guide to what he is ready to be taught and in your 
answers should be embodied not only the larger features 
of his present instruction but the outline of his future 
education; hence the form they take, and not the con- 
text, is of supreme importance. There are times when 
it is more instructive to withhold knowledge than to 
give it. 
The aim of this entire discussion is to emphasize the 
necessity for a sane and fixed policy in dealing with 
the children’s questions, in order that they may be put 
into the frame of mind to accept instruction and profit 
by it. In the first place, check promptly any tendency 
of the child to question about things that do not con- 
cern him, as those relating to grown-up affairs, else 
   
-P-A-G-E-208
200 Bookless Lessons for the rennet other 
you will have on your hands that most obnoxious little 
being, an improperly curious child. In the second place, 
do not confuse natural curiosity, such as the animals 
display, with the desire for knowledge. When the 
child asks questions which are naturally prompted by 
his observations, ask yourself whether or not the sub- 
ject is suitable for present instruction. How the water 
goes through the pipes is a suitable subject, but ques- 
tions that belong primarily to a course in biology are 
not suitable. Use your good judgment in deciding this 
point. I merely allude to it here, in order to urge that 
you do not allow your judgment to be overridden by 
the preachments of faddists who have done irremedia- 
ble harm by recommending matter-of-fact answers to 
all of childhood’s questioning. 
Do not let children suffer disenchantment. Their 
unwisdom is adorable. It is the natural and beautiful 
state of the young mind to be filled with wonder and 
awe at its surroundings, to see mystery in every leaf 
and flower and cloud and star. Do not destroy this 
faith with scientific explanations that do not explain, 
but try to give answers that lift soul and mind heaven- 
ward. Talk about the common living forms—worm, 
grasshopper, spider—in a way that will give children 
wholesome material to ponder on and question about 
and lead them to see mystery everywhere. Let us sup- 
pose, for example, that it is September; the swallows 
that began to gather and train in August for their long 
fight south, are leaving us; other migratory birds fol- 
low; last of all, the honking wild geese attract our atten- 
tion in their V-shaped flight-formation as they try to 
find in milder climes a refuge from the cold northern 
blasts. How do they know? Who taught them? In-
-P-A-G-E-209
  
Religious Education 201 
stinct, if you please, but what is instinct? If you simply 
tell your children that the all-kind Creator guides them, 
through their parents, they will understand that and 
accept it readily. The fascination that living nature 
has for the unspoiled child opens a ready road to rev- 
erence and humility, the ordinary observable happen- 
ings furnishing the best of texts. The moment of 
intense interest is the time to impress a lifelong lesson. 
Best of all subjects is the new baby. Where did he 
come from? God sent him here, a new white soul, to 
learn to be a good child, a good man, to go to school 
in this world so that he may be ready to serve God in 
the next world. Then follow many little talks on the 
heavenly home, the dear little soul and the weak little 
body that must be so carefully guarded and cherished. 
When it comes to questions about that road from 
heaven to earth, answer him as you will have answered 
him a thousand times before: that he is not old enough 
to understand, that grown people know something 
about it but not everything, and that only in the next 
world shall we have all our questions answered. 
As for Death, do not speak of it as nothingness, but 
as life in another sphere or form. Do not injudiciously 
suggest this subject, since there can be no advantage 
to a child in hearing mention of birth and death until 
the mind is sufficiently developed to consider the possi- 
bility—a huge thought—of any creature as not exist- 
ing, now existing, and then passing on. Wait until 
something in the child’s own experience, like the pass- 
ing of a neighbor, moves him to ask questions and he 
seems ready to be told that we came from a mysterious 
unknown and shall stay here a little while, until our 
work is done and God calls us back. All this is so
-P-A-G-E-210
  202 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
wonderful, and every thought in connection with it so 
full of awful possibilities, that it is all-important to 
touch on it with the greatest reverence and only at the 
proper moment. 
There is no need to dwell on the earthy, physical 
side of this change; indeed, every effort should be made 
to have children think only of the spirit’s departure 
for its Father’s home, accompanied not at all by his 
wealth or poverty, joys or woes, but only by his works. 
Do not allow children to grow morbid on the subject 
of death, but at the same time, in the presence of a 
soul’s departure for the shores of eternity, or even the 
discussion of it, the very least that common decency 
demands is a serious and respectful attitude. 
Teach children to value life. Do not allow them 
to pick a flower merely to tear it in pieces, but teach 
them that if they pluck even a daisy it should be put 
into water and properly cared for, that life is far too 
beautiful and too sacred for mere destruction. Again 
and again impress upon them how easy it is to destroy 
and how impossible to revive. 
Children are naturally eager to learn the why and 
wherefore of living phenomena that come to their atten- 
tion, and when such knowledge is given too soon and 
too directly in so many words—for words often ob- 
scure truth—it is not beneficial. 
There are two principal branches of instruction 
suited to preparing the child mind for a wholesome 
knowledge of physical processes. One is nature study, 
continued throughout the seasons, from year to year, 
filling the mind with lovely thoughts, notions of God’s 
marvelous power, eagerness for knowledge for its own 
dear sake. The other is religious teaching, lifting up
-P-A-G-E-211
Religious Education 203 
and bearing along all other instruction. A beautiful 
sunset—God made it; a fine tree—our Heavenly Father 
made it grow; a bird—God made it and taught it how 
to build its nest and how to sing; a worm in the path- 
way—God made that worm and gave it life. Jane 
Elizabeth could crush it with her little foot, and the 
wisest man that ever lived could not bring it to life 
again. 
Now, continuing these two branches of instruction 
side by side, your children become imbued with a feel- 
ing of awe and reverence for the power of God, until 
they see His hand in all things, whether they can under- 
stand it or not. They will grow in beauty of character, 
in the love of knowledge, in humility of spirit, in 
respect for authority. They are then teachable. In 
their souls are growing those lovely things quite beyond 
the reach of intellect, things that cannot be gauged 
according to the measurement of solids. In their minds 
is developing a standard whereby they will be enabled 
not only to measure others, but to measure self. That 
training would be of little worth that did not engender 
in the child’s mind just and fair self-criticism, yet 
“Know thyself” is out of the question unless one is 
prepared to make clear-eyed comparisons with what is 
outside and beyond self,

CHAPTER XI 
MORALS AND MANNERS 
Tue closing gong had rung in one of our great 
department stores, and moving heedlessly in the gen- 
eral direction of outdoors I walked through an exit 
marked ‘Employees Only,” to find myself in the polite 
but determined grasp of uniformed men, who pro- 
ceeded to examine my possessions with a minuteness 
more scientific than flattering. When they had satis- 
fied themselves that my packages had been obtained in 
the conventional way my captors permitted me to move 
on, while they subjected to a similar examination the 
long line of waiting employees behind me. Knowing 
the manager of the store, I asked him whether they 
were really compelled to take for granted the dishonesty 
of a majority of their employees. He replied in the 
affirmative, adding: “The surprising thing to me is 
that it is not the boys and girls from the neediest homes 
who give the most trouble, but those in fairly good 
circumstances, whose parents have asked us to employ 
them mainly to give them business training. Of course 
it all goes back to the way they have been brought up.” 
Let us glance at a too common instance of upbring- 
ing, such as might rather be called a “jerking up.” 
Two children from the nearby summer hotel stopped in 
front of our house and began plucking the roses that 
peeped over the fence. Their mother, though only a 
few feet away, paid no attention until she realized that 
they were observed, whereupon she turned on the chil- 
204
-P-A-G-E-213
  
~ Morals and Manners 205 
dren and reprimanded them sharply, exclaiming, 
“Naughty little girls, to take flowers that did not be- 
long to them,” and so on, until they passed beyond our 
hearing. 
The six-year-old son of a wealthy woman makes a 
practice of foraging the neighborhood for the posses- 
sions of other children, bringing home anything port- 
able that strikes his fancy. Not a day passes but the 
mother is under the necessity of restoring a stolen 
wagon or tricycle or toy gun. Once or twice she has 
tried to make him take back the things he has appro- 
priated, but he has refused, so she sends a servant or 
goes herself. In deep mortification she makes apolo- 
gies and restitution and wonders what is going to 
become of her boy. 
Here is a different story: One morning seventy 
years ago a little girl living among the mountains went 
with her mother to a neighbor’s cabin across the nar- 
row valley. While the women chatted the child played 
in the yard, digging wells and making dams with a 
wonderful tool that seemed to have been made ex- 
pressly for her needs, a fluting-iron, with which Granny 
Wilson used to curl the ruffle of her white starched 
caps. When it was time to go home it was out of the 
question for the five-year-old to relinquish the won- 
derful toy, yet her natural intelligence impelled her to 
keep it under her apron out of her mother’s sight. No 
sooner, however, had the child started engineering 
operations in the home yard than the misdeed was dis- 
covered. The mother acted promptly, without any 
judicial palaver. “Sarah, you have taken what does 
not belong to you. Get ready and carry that fluting- 
iron straight back to Granny Wilson.” Sarah stub-
-P-A-G-E-214
206 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
bornly refused to go, whereupon her mother broke a 
flexible twig from the big birch and switched the little 
legs. Not only that, but she walked behind the child 
the entire way to Granny Wilson’s, still using the 
switch when the culprit lagged, and there was no rest 
until the fluting-iron had been placed by the child in 
the owner’s hand. 
Never again did Sarah need correction on that score, 
and to-day she has the satisfaction of seeing her own 
well-trained children occupying high places and re- 
spected even beyond the boundaries of their native state 
for their inflexible honesty and well-tried courage. 
Now, it was not merely a whipping that taught Sarah 
her great lesson. That alone would not have sufficed, 
but the needed switching was given to enforce obedience 
and to convey understanding where words would have 
failed. The effectiveness of her punishment lay in 
the fact that she was not permitted to reap pleasure or 
profit from the misdeed; that there was no misunder- 
standing in her mind as to why she was punished; that 
chastisement was prompt, enabling her to see and real- 
ize that a certain cause produced a certain effect. Had 
the mother depended upon reasoning with so young a 
child, she would have failed utterly, for it is not in the 
power of language to convey to such an immature 
mind a clear distinction between right and wrong, ex- 
cept that to the parents certain things are pleasing and 
others displeasing. The cleverest kind of sermon on 
honesty still leaves the child of five or six fairly satis- 
fied that the main objection to stealing lies in being 
found out. 
When Sarah’s son was eight years old his mother 
discovered that he was taking small coins from her
-P-A-G-E-215
  Morals and Manners 207 
purse to buy chewing gum for his little “gang.” In- 
stead of locking up the purse she set about teaching him 
to resist temptation. She did not whip him or humili- 
ate him before the family; indeed, she did not even 
allow the household to know of the peccadillo, but she 
explained to him the wickedness of stealing, the low 
regard in which a dishonest person is held, the impos- 
sibility of continuing such a course without discovery, 
the difficulty of regaining a good name when once it 
has been besmirched, the certain punishment awaiting 
those so unfortunate as to form the habit of theft. 
Inasmuch as the child’s entire home environment was 
one of uncompromising honesty and open dealing, this 
talk was enough, and he never again transgressed. 
The mapping out of the human mind in its relation 
to right and wrong is no easy task. However, the 
mother need not concern herself with the lengthier 
disquisitions of the moralists. She need only establish 
a certain few relationships of the plainer sort, which 
are, that the soul is the center from which all education 
should proceed; that morals are religion in everyday 
affairs, and that the relation between morals and man- 
ners is very close. Conscience is that practical judg- 
ment in our nature by which we recognize the differ- 
ence between rightness and wrongness. It not only 
warns us against wrong but is a force to make us do 
right. We are not born with a fully developed con- 
science. It follows upon religious instruction and dis- 
cipline and develops as do the deeper feelings and the 
power of thinking, strengthening with the habits 
imparted by steady restraint, exercised first from with- 
out and later from within. 
It is the parents’ task to control the child’s acts and

direct his thoughts until he acquires a measure of self- 
direction and judgment. He soon learns that no wrong 
can be committed without bringing its own punish- 
ment. Thus the habit of avoiding what is forbidden 
is gradually formed and thereby the sense of law is 
acquired. The child is ready to be educated on this 
basis to a sense of moral obligation, for when the 
reasoning powers reach maturity the individual sees 
why restrictions have been imposed; he recognizes that 
our conduct is the most serious thing we have to attend 
to; the idea of duty seems natural because habitual ; 
and the older he grows the more ready he is to behave 
rightly of his free will and apart from the fear of 
punishment. Morals grounded on compulsion thus 
become morals grounded on self-approval. Parental 
control is only a means to engender self-control; if it 
does not do this, it fails. We must all make our own 
mistakes, and even children must be given latitude to 
get into trouble, to find out for themselves by deterring 
experience many, many things. 
Temptation is a valuable part of moral training, since 
virtue is not merely passive goodness, but strength in 
goodness. However, the temptations permitted to 
childhood should be only sufficient to strengthen its 
powers of resistance and not to overcome them. For 
example, instead of putting everything out of a child’s 
reach, train him not to meddle with forbidden things. 
Arouse his pride in overcoming temptations such as 
that to take cake or candy left within reach, showing 
him that he makes himself stronger each time he 
chooses good and avoids evil when it is hard to do so, 
and that in this way he trains his will to overcome 
desire; but when the child’s will is weakened by hunger,
-P-A-G-E-217
  Morals and Manners 209 
these temptations are unreasonably great. Instil a 
wholesome respect for the difference between “mine” 
and “thine.” Do not allow a child to borrow even a 
pencil without the owner’s permission, but give him a 
pencil of his own. Do not be overconfident that unde- 
veloped powers of resistance will be greater than a 
child’s restless energy. 
What is truth? Truth is seeing things as they are 
and describing exactly what is seen. What is a lie? 
“A lie,” says Webster, “is an intentional statement of 
an untruth designed to mislead another.”” Most moth- 
ers want their children to be above all things truthful, 
yet so many of them seem to stumble on all the twenty 
different ways of making children liars, and so few 
find the one way to make them truthful, that the suc- 
cessful ones are indeed to be congratulated. The right 
way is simple, but not necessarily easy. The first 
essential is such a knowledge of human nature as one 
gets by close and loving observation of children, the 
next, patience and perseverance in applying this 
knowledge. 
To the mother who tells me: “I am in despair because 
my boy of six tells me outrageous lies. I scold him 
and punish him but it seems to do no good.” I reply, 
“Do not get excited because a young child attempts 
to lie outrageously. There is more ground for worry 
when youngsters do not stretch the truth, for only by 
erring from the way of truth can they learn to keep it. 
Do not worry, or hope to overcome lying by sermon- 
izing. Do not imagine you can beat truthfulness into 
a child, but deal with the fault so that it may be com- 
pletely overcome during the years of childhood.” 
On the other hand, how often does one hear a young
-P-A-G-E-218
  210 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
mother boast: “My child is naturally truthful. Al- 
though he is only five, I have taught him the wicked- 
ness of lying and have helped him to harness his 
imagination so that there is no fear of trouble with 
him on that score.” To such a mother I make answer : 
“Have patience, your child has not yet learned to lie. 
The enticing, momentary advantage of lying has not 
yet dawned on him. Young human beings are prone 
to be untruthful, and you will yet have to deal with an 
epidemic of lying, which is as inevitable as teething. 
As soon as the child reasons farther he will begin to 
reason out things as he wants them, and if by a mere 
matter of word-painting he can bring such things to 
pass, be very sure that he will not shy at the most con- 
venient way of gaining his ends. Be ready to meet 
this. Turn it into a phase of moral and mental growth 
that passes without leaving scars. Never let him think 
that he has fooled you, or allow him to gain anything 
by untruthfulness or deceit. Still, you will scarcely 
effect a radical cure of this habit before he is about 
ten years old, when he should have found out that 
lying does not pay, and when the moral sense will also 
have begun to help.” 
Now do not infer from this that I am one of those 
materialistic persons who believes that goodness grows 
out of necessity. Far from it. But truthtelling has 
two sides, first, the ability to gather impressions cor- 
rectly and to state clearly and exactly what can be said 
about them ; second, cultivated control of self in stating 
facts without addition or omission, even though to 
personal disadvantage. Even before there is actual 
lying, fight the temptation to lie with several weapons: 
Religious instruction and discipline; observation les-
-P-A-G-E-219
  Morals and Manners 211 
sons that enable the child to see things exactly as they 
are; language lessons that enable him to describe things 
exactly as they are seen; moral lessons that show the 
ugliness as well as the futility of lying, the great value 
of honesty, the beauty of truth; stories and talks that 
foster the idea of resisting temptation. 
Children love to play with words as they do with 
toys, experimenting, learning their possibilities. Some 
of their lies are playful; some are told to tease; some 
are imitative; some day-dreaming; some for expedi- 
ency. Sometimes the regrettable multitude of untruths 
that distress the mother are the outgrowth of timidity, 
or an unconscious acknowledgment of failure, or a 
symptom of lack of self-control. The child, of course, 
exaggerates ; he sees the whole world in an exaggerated 
aspect. He cannot tell things exactly\as they are, for 
he has no exact knowledge to start with, since without 
careful and prolonged training in close observation and 
accurate description, it is impossible to see things as 
they are and to describe what we see. Such training 
and practice given regularly from the age of three on- 
ward supply the child with the tools of accuracy, which 
is the twin brother of honesty. But how make certain 
that he will use these tools? By religious and moral 
training for that purpose, given carefully from the age 
of six or seven onward. The child needs the prop of 
knowing that we cannot deceive God and that our great 
enemy is the Father of Lies, who will pay in his own 
coin those who work for him. 
These suggestions will be useful only to parents 
who set their children a good example, whose hearts 
as well as tongues are above untruth, You cannot 
fool children in this respect. You cannot be one thing 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  212 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
and teach another. They will detect you in genteel 
lying, politic lying, economic lying, much more quickly 
than does your grown-up neighbor. There is no earthly 
use in talking to a child about truthtelling if you lie 
to him or for him or about him. There are even 
parents who will teach a child to lie for their own con- 
venience, thus doing him a thousand times the harm 
that would come through ordinary untaught lying. A 
child that imagines his mother does not know anything 
about lying, and who has never detected her in an 
exaggeration, will probably look on lying as so wicked 
and abominable that he will keep to the narrow path of 
truth. 
Many parents lie to their children in order to secure 
temporary obedience. “If you don’t stop crying the 
policeman will come and take you,” is a not uncommon 
threat, which after a few repetitions grows thread- 
bare, whereupon the mother goes still further, even pre- 
tending to telephone for the police to come and get the 
naughty five-year-old. I have known strict church- 
goers to do this very awful thing. If you make threats 
that you cannot or will not enforce, even the youngest 
child will soon learn to apply the short and ugly word 
to your weakness. Your “must” should invariably 
mean “must.” 
Many parents make truthtelling difficult for children 
by condoning misstatements at one time and attempting 
on another occasion to correct the fault. David assures 
his mother that he has performed his regular task of 
sweeping the porch. Investigation shows that he has 
not removed the rocker or disturbed the rug, but the 
mother has time to spare and is in a good temper, so 
she smilingly tells him to do better next time and her-
-P-A-G-E-221
  Morals and Manners 213 
self finishes up while David goes to play. The next 
time he tells her that he has swept the porch, she is 
busy, and company comes and finds the porch is un- 
swept. Her pride is hurt and she punishes David for 
an untruth, the fault of which, in this instance, is wholly 
her own. 
Too many parents try to differentiate between lying 
and evasions, between speaking an untruth and keep- 
ing silence where rightness demands speech. This is 
fatal, The one question to decide is: Was there intent 
to deceive? Too many parents countenance trickery 
among children, cheating each other in trifles, and 
even look on it as a sign of very promising genius. 
This will betray the children into thievery as well as 
lying in their riper years. 
As soon as children know what lying means, it is 
highly necessary that they should be made sensible of 
the scandal of telling a lie, but I would not have a child 
know a day earlier than necessary that there is such a 
thing in the world as lying. The less talking about 
badness and wickedness the better, for while a young 
child may appear to know the difference, he does not 
and will only become confused by well-meant explana- 
tions beyond his understanding. But when he has 
learned that there is such a thing as untruthfulness, 
make it abhorrent to him, make truth beautiful, and 
continue the training in observation. 
Talk mainly about truth and be wary about men- 
tioning lying. In undertaking to teach a young child 
the wickedness of deceit, you give him a lesson in that 
art and science that might otherwise have been deferred 
for a year or two. Many a child finds out for the first 
time that there are lies by being told not to tell them.
-P-A-G-E-222
  214 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
Natural inquisitiveness does the rest. A little fellow 
rushed in one day in terror and told his mother that 
the devil was sitting on a beam in the barn. Investi- 
gation showed that the foul fiend of his childish fright 
was a barn-owl, blinking down on him when he had 
run to the barn for refuge from the consequences of 
a naughtiness. If the mother had been so tactless as 
to accuse him then and there of lying, defining and 
illustrating lies so that the idea would be really fixed in 
his mind, arousing sufficient interest in her subject to 
make any kind of impression, her lecture would have 
held all the interest of a fairy story for him, and he 
would forthwith have furnished her with all the neces- 
sary material for a course of lectures. 
Avoid as far as possible everything that might tempt 
a young child to prevaricate. Only when urgent cir- 
cumstances demand it, ask him whether he has done 
a thing or not. This in most cases is a useless ques- 
tion, because it is the natural thing for a young child 
to say that which in his opinion will please you and 
exonerate himself. If you ask a pupil whether he 
understands a thing he will say yes, if you ask your 
child whether he did a naughty thing he will naturally 
say no. When you suspect a child of having done 
something naughty, use your own ingenuity to satisfy 
yourself as to his culpability, and if you find him guilty, 
judge him and reprimand or punish him if he deserves 
it. Toa child of four or five, punishment should not 
be meted out for any transgression except direct diso- 
bedience to his parents’ clearly given and thoroughly 
understood commands. If, knowing that he has done 
a thing, you ask him whether he did it or not, you are 
courting trouble, and in addition to disobedience will
-P-A-G-E-223
  Morals and Manners 215 
have such difficulties to face as untruthfulness, dissim- 
ulation, and hypocrisy. 
Train the child to recognize and admit his mistakes ( 
instead of condoning them. Both in school and at 
home, one hears such things as this: “James, you have 
not spelled that word correctly.” “Oh, just a ‘t’ too 
many,” answers James, who has written latter for 
later. Hs is trying to cloak his mistake with a pre- 
varication, to avoid admitting that a mistake was made. 
Do not allow this to pass. To recognize error and 
acknowledge it is a cornerstone of wisdom. Once the 
unwillingness to admit oneself in the wrong has taken 
root it is very difficult to eradicate. 
A word as to the make-believe of a lively, imagina- 
tive child mind, the feignings or inventions uttered 
with no intent to deceive. Imagination is a gift with- 
out which we were poorer than the dullest clod. Be- 
ware of destroying or crippling it, calling it lying. 
Attend to other phases of discipline, but interfere little 
with harmless imaginings. Meet the wild fanciful 
tale with a smile of sympathetic understanding, which 
neither approves nor disapproves. You need not even 
say: “But Elsie knows that she is just pretending?” 
and insist upon the child’s reassuring you on this point. 
There is absolutely no relation between this make- 
_ believe and lying unless you establish the relationship 
by talking about it. 
To return to lying: Instead of calling an exaggera- 
tion an untruth, lead the child by questioning to see 
its inaccuracy, just as you would correct any other 
fault or reprove an ill-done task, just as you would 
follow him up to indicate the half-swept corner of the 
porch or the badly dusted chair and make him do it
-P-A-G-E-224
  216 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
exactly right. Teach your child to deliver a message 
exactly as it is given to him. Make him repeat it to 
you until he does it correctly, for precision even in this 
small degree will help to offset the natural tendency to 
exaggeration, boasting, and other distortion of facts. 
Teach children not to tell as news anything of whose 
truth they are not sure. Teach them not to embellish 
the news they relate, not to speak rashly or without a 
purpose, and not to retail empty nonsense. Make them . 
keep silence regarding what they do not understand. 
Make the child tell what he really hears and sees, not 
what he imagines or fancies; make him repeat things 
without adding or omitting; make him answer all 
questions to the point, without prevarication or beating 
about the bush. If a question is asked in the present 
tense, insist on the answer being given in the present 
tense. 
Awaken the child’s conscience by telling him that 
every lie is known to God and is shunned and detested 
by all God-fearing men. Make him repeat often the 
Commandment: “Thou shalt not bear false witness 
against thy neighbor,” and such maxims as: “Sin has 
a great many tools, but a lie is a handle that fits them 
all”; “He who tells one lie must tell nine to cover it 
up.” Let him overhear conversations in which a hor- 
ror of the lie is expressed. This is more effective when 
done indirectly, for if grown persons abhor a liar, 
children absorb the feeling. However, even with the 
feeling of horror towards a lie, children will be strictly 
truthful only if they get daily and hourly training to 
form the habit of truth. 
Train children not to make rash promises. <A child 
should not make promises, nor has a grown person any
-P-A-G-E-225
Morals and Manners 219 
right to extract them from a child. Do not make chil- 
dren apologize as a punishment, nor promise to be good 
and not to repeat the offense, for pledges of various 
kinds, whether in the name of religion, patriotism, 
charity, obedience, or honor, constitute a training in 
easy lying and should not be countenanced. Children 
have not the stamina to keep a promise. They break 
it, and learn how easy it is to break it, and there is 
thus formed the contemptible habit of breaking his 
word before the child is old enough to realize its 
sacredness. 
Even more objectionable is it to tell things to a 
child under his promise of secrecy. Such matters as 
are usually imparted to a child in this way are in any 
case unsuited to his years and should be strictly kept 
from his knowledge. The objection is not alone to the 
unfairness of burdening him with a temptation too 
great for most grown people, but that the heart of a 
child should be open to floods of sunshine. There 
should by right be no dark corners in it. Plant secrecy 
and you plant an ugly furtiveness that can never be 
entirely uprooted. 
Good manners come from well-established, gener- 
ally-recognized good habits, both of which are impos- 
sible without habitual self-control. Good manners sit 
easy and seem natural where mind and body are under 
self-direction, but without this precious accomplish- 
ment they seem affected and inharmonious. A well- 
educated child is always a good-mannered child. As I 
wrote this my eye fell on a sentence in the evening 
paper: “The whole world opens its arms to the boy 
with good manners.” Back of good manners is the 
great rule of humanity, to do to others as we would
-P-A-G-E-226
  218 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
have them do to us, which calls for occasional self-sac- 
rifice for the sake of others. Turned into simple verse, 
a child of five will learn and love this rule: 
“T do to others as I would 
That they should do to me; 
’T will make me honest, kind, and good, 
As every child should be.” 
Make the child practice this. Teach him to address 
or to answer questions in a way that shows respectful 
consideration for others, especially his elders. Make 
him come to you and speak, but if without any good 
reason he should attempt to shout to you, ask him half- 
reprovingly: ‘Who has hurt you? Who is threaten- 
ing you?” so that he may realize the impropriety of his 
conduct. Make the child offer his chair to an older 
person standing; knock before entering a room; answer 
the question “Who is there?” by giving his name, not 
saying “Me.” From such little things spring good 
habits which finally develop into virtues. Check what- 
ever offends or annoys others or tends towards ill- 
breeding or roughness. Strike out each undesirable 
characteristic the moment it appears. When children 
get naughty intervene at once. Little by little you can 
suppress all those things that they must not do. Sub- 
duing the manner subdues the fault. Do not allow a 
child to demand your attention when he sees that it is 
required elsewhere, but make him wait respectfully 
until you are ready to give ear to him. 
When your child is speaking to you make him show 
a certain respect for you. He must be polite and 
respectful to you on every single occasion, which
-P-A-G-E-227
  
  Morals and Manners 219° 
excludes every vestige of flippancy. If he comes into 
the room improperly and noisily, send him out at once 
without scolding, and tell him to come in in a proper 
manner. Do not let a single such act escape your 
vigilance. Stop loud talking and yelling and make 
the child subdue his voice to a proper pitch when in the 
house. Let the house rule him; do not let him rule 
the house. Do not tolerate any of the children doing 
things that make older persons uncomfortable. Make 
the boys especially think of the comfort of others at 
all times, which they will not learn to do unless they 
be made to doit. They will respect you if you demand 
respect from them. 
Take account of the influence that correctness of 
bodily attitude has, not only on physical well-being and 
beauty, but on morals and manners and even the whole 
mentality. Decency, propriety, health, all require that 
a child should be accustomed to keep his whole body in 
a suitable attitude. How to stand, walk, and sit prop- 
erly is as much a part of moral and intellectual as of 
physical training. The animal period is by no means 
past until the body has learned to answer the rulings of 
a well-ruled mind. Space allows for only a few sug- 
gestions here: 
In standing, the feet should be turned out, with 
the heels a little apart. The child should learn to 
stand perfectly still, not shifting from one foot to the 
other, and when he walks it should not be either tiptoe 
or with dragging feet. When seated, keep the knees 
not too far apart or too close together. To keep mov- 
ing the feet or stretching them out is extremely ill- 
bred. Never allow the child to sit crosslegged, or to 
slide down in the chair and sit on the end of the spine,
-P-A-G-E-228
  220 Bookless Les .s for the Teacher-Mother 
for either position creates a tension that throws the 
entire nervous system out of adjustment, interferes 
with the free circulation of the blood, and may easily 
lead to deformities of which any good physician will 
advise you. Make children stand with well-carried 
shoulders, without hanging the head nor yet holding 
it up in an impertinent way. Train them to avoid loll- 
ing, often changing place, swinging the feet, turning 
and twisting hands or feet, and all such awkward 
motions. Train them to hold the head erect when 
speaking, and not to answer a question by a nod or 
shake of the head. 
Train children to avoid putting the hand to the head, 
especially at the table. Teach them to bear inconven- 
iences without turning, scratching, or using gestures, 
not simply because these acts may be offensive to others 
but because every act of self-restraint is a step towards 
self-control. Make children do things decently and in 
order long before there is consciousness of the why. 
The youngest child should be taught to restrain eager- 
ness about being helped at table, to avoid stirring the 
plate, beating the table, or other signs of impatience. 
Children ought not to share in the conversation at 
table. They should listen and learn, although they nat- 
urally prefer to give what they imagine to be their 
opinions. This makes it hard for them to learn in 
school, where they try to teach their teachers, which, 
however, is a less serious offense than that of trying 
to correct their parents. I suppose not one child in 
a thousand escapes this fault. It simply has to be 
eliminated by constant watchfulness and stern sup- 
pression. 
When one sees the poor returns sometimes made by
-P-A-G-E-229
Morals and Mus“ers 221 
children to the parents who have loved them and 
worked and saved and sacrificed for them, the tempta- 
tion to moralize on this subject becomes overpowering. 
After the children have grown up it is of little use for 
parents to wring their hands and demand of heaven 
an explanation of their selfishness. From their earliest 
years children should be taught to realize their bless- 
ings and be thankful to those who provide them. 
Gratitude, like religion, patriotism, and other of the 
fine things of life, is a fair flower of the heart that 
must be well rooted and tenderly cultivated before we 
can expect full and fragrant blossoming. The educa- 
tion which neglects the heart while cultivating the head 
is no education at all. 
Begin by teaching children to come to their parents 
and thank them for each meal. In this way a natural 
feeling of gratitude is developed, and out of it will 
grow a feeling of reverence and gratitude towards God 
for His bountiful gifts. You cannot make a child 
thankful simply by telling him that he ought to be 
thankful; he must be shown by example as well as 
word. I suggest this plan: Each child, as he finishes 
the meal, should go to the father, kiss him and say: 
“Thank you, father, for a good dinner,” or whatever 
the meal may be, then to the mother and thank her 
nicely also. Require the child to speak distinctly and 
not to mumble, so that this practice may not degenerate 
into objectionable formalism. Make them do this as 
many times a day as there are common meals, year in 
and year out. When they meet father and mother for 
the first time in the morning, let the children kiss each 
and say: “I wish you a good morning, papa,” or “I 
wish you a good morning, mama.” Such daily greet-
-P-A-G-E-230
  222 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
ings will grow stilted if not respectfully and lovingly 
used. But even lip-service, which at heart implies good 
manners, is preferable to the unmannerly lack of con- 
sideration and respect that too many children flaunt 
in the faces of their elders. Put such daily greetings 
into practice and you will find that they will become a 
natural expression of loving respect, which will bring 
into your home a sweet atmosphere of refinement, rev- 
erence, and love, wherein the roots of goodness grow 
strong. Children should be taught that they cannot 
sufficiently prove their respect for their father and 
mother, to whom under God, they owe everything, and 
they should be accustomed to bid them good-night 
before going to bed. 
Accustom children to say grace at table. This most 
natural act of gratitude, thanking God for the repast, 
seems to be regarded as old-fashioned and unworthy 
of enlightened people, but even the heathens of old 
Rome did better, for they poured out wine to the only 
gods they knew. Call the child’s attention to the man- 
ners of various domestic animals. How nice to give 
the chickens water every day. Does she notice how 
they lift up their heads to say thank you every time 
they take a drink? The pigs think only about them- 
selves and forget to thank anyone. 
Do not miss the seed-time of this early age for habits 
of unselfishness, which will take many, many years to 
establish, for they are more humane than human. 
Selfishness is as natural to children as breathing, and 
only motherly love and devotion can change the natural 
incompleteness of human childhood into the pure gold 
of humane manhood and womanhood. I tell you this 
so that you may not be rudely disappointed when you
-P-A-G-E-231
  Morals and Manner 223 
seem to fail of attaining your end. Your patience 
must be long-suffering. 
Mothers sometimes complain of a lack of sympathy 
on their children’s part. Now, sympathy means a feel- 
ing with suffering and how can this be known by those 
who, since they have not suffered, have not had the 
experience out of which sympathy grows? The kin- 
dergarten age is too early to do much towards arous- 
ing these feelings. There is indeed a distinct danger 
in hastening maturity of the emotions, which leads to 
precocity and perhaps to a state of mind where all feel- 
ings become uncontrollable and govern the will. The 
emergence to a higher moral and intellectual state must 
come by degrees and slowly. It will come naturally 
and genuinely with experience and right guidance. 
Develop sentiment very gradually. Do not play on the 
child’s emotions, or appeal to the feelings as a means 
of getting children to follow your lead. 
The farther you can put self into the background, 
and the more you can turn the child’s thoughts out- 
ward rather than selfward, the more securely do you 
ward off evil. Contrary to a widespread notion, it is 
the mind, not the body, that originates the first prompt- 
ings to social misconduct. If this were fully realized, 
there would be fewer instances of child-depravity 
directly chargeable to the parents, either through their 
heedlessness or through well-meant efforts to instruct 
young children in matters which belong to riper years. 
The important thing for the child is to live a healthy 
child life. Never permit jesting with children on such 
subjects as swains and sweethearts. 
On the whole, it is better to keep children away from 
gatherings of grown people, even such as the church 
 
-P-A-G-E-232
  224. Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
sewing circle, where in order to make themselves agree- 
able people take too much notice of a child and spoil 
him by making him self-conscious and self-centered. 
Chance remarks, not intended for young ears, are often 
made, which linger in the child’s mind and give him a 
distorted notion of things. When you must go to 
such places leave him with his grandmother or some 
other trustworthy person, but do not indiscriminately 
unburden yourself of him to anybody. Your duties to 
your children must unquestionably take precedence 
over any social duties. 
Do not allow children to make engagements with 
other children without first obtaining your consent. 
When the child takes it upon himself to invite com- 
pany or to accept an invitation without first getting per- 
mission from you, simply cancel the engagement. This, 
as you will find, is by no means an unnecessary pre- 
caution. 
If the children in their play are talking about absurd 
things that seem of an objectionable or harmful trend, 
tell them to stop talking nonsense. If you think their 
talk merely unsuitable and out of place, divert the con- 
versation, but if it is simply innocent, imaginary non- 
sense, let it go. Such fair, childish nonsense can do no 
harm, but on the contrary is rather desirable. Let 
play be play, and work be work, each in its proper place 
and at the proper time. If this be their principle 
through life it will keep them steady and make them © 
happy. Expect sensible behavior. Do not countenance fool- 
ishness and hysteria. The silly squealing and screech- 
ing of girls at play should be checked, for it is unneces-

play and should not be tolerated. Noise outdoors is 
not objectionable except when overdone, but wild yell- 
ing is overdoing it. 
Suppress immoderate anger and the desire for 
revenge, otherwise the child becomes headstrong and 
unruly, good nature turns to ill humor, understanding 
and judgment are warped into wilfulness and prejudice. ‘ 
Hate has no place in the heart of a child. When it 
becomes rooted it changes that heart into something 
entirely different from what the Creator made it or 
intended it to be. 
There are right and wrong ways of mixing up 
religion with the efforts to correct childish naughtiness. 
I have known a mother to punish a three-year-old by 
making him pray until he sees and confesses his 
wrong, and then asks for forgiveness. This is not a 
safe proceeding. The little child is irresponsible, a 
fact which we cannot change. He has not done wrong 
unless he knows that he has done wrong, for without 
the knowledge there can be no sin. It is the parents’ 
responsibility to enforce right conduct. The child is 
naughty when he does something forbidden by the par- 
ents, and bad when he offends God. This principle is 
healthy, wholesome, and sufficient. But there can be 
no offense against God without the evil intention, for 
even the civil law would not pronounce the offender 
guilty unless evil intention could be brought home to 
him. The mother is the one to show him in a few 
words wherein he has done wrong, otherwise you make 
the child deceive himself and set him on the road to 
hypocrisy. A young friend of mine who persistently 
denied helping herself to her sister’s choice candy was 
sent upstairs to “talk it over with God,” and when she 
-
-P-A-G-E-234
226 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
came down, instead of making the usual confession of 
wrongdoing, she still maintained innocence. This 
troubled the mother so that at bedtime she asked the 
child what God had said to her, whereupon Ruth 
replied: ‘He said, ‘Of course you know, Ruthie, that 
you took the candy, but let’s fool sister a while 
longer.’ ” 
There are many available props that help the child 
to gain self-control, the best and surest of which is the 
realization that God is everywhere, that He sees us in 
the night as in the day, that He reads our inmost 
thoughts, and that we should be more particular not to 
displease Him than our companions. 
By means of symbolical language place before 
the child in a concrete way the laws of religion and 
morality. Few children can comprehend a statement 
to the effect that a good deed will yield rich harvests 
in eternity, but tell them that our deeds are written 
down in the Book of Life by the Recording Angel, 
good deeds in letters of gold, bad deeds in black, good 
deeds to the right, bad deeds to the left. Every good 
deed makes the Angel rejoice, but when he has to dip 
-his pen to write in black, he is sad. Perhaps our sin- 
cere sorrow will help him to blot out the record. Let 
us strive so that at the close of each day our good deeds 
may outnumber the others. If we do succeed in this 
daily, then at the end of life, when good and bad are 
weighed exactly, our balance will be on the right side. " 
Such illustrations appeal to a child. They are under- 
standable, and offer something to strive for. They are 
near, not far, in time and space, and the child mind 
can grasp them when talk about character would not 
mean anything.
-P-A-G-E-235
  Morals and Manners 227 
The voice of conscience could not be better portrayed 
to the child than by telling him that to know what is 
right we have only to ask our good angel, who will tell 
us, and that we have in him a safe guide, who would 
gladly conduct us in the way that leads to heaven. 
What a help in temptation to recall that if we yield our 
good angel must turn away his face and weep, and that 
if we listen too often to the tempter, and heed not the 
guardian angel’s warning, he must finally leave us alto- 
gether, for he cannot stay where sin is. Is it not true 
that the voice of conscience is the safe guide and will 
remain so throughout a long life unless stilled by our 
refusal to heed it? 
It is often possible to transmute self-interest into 
something nobler, a prop to character. Show children 
that unless we are invariably to be relied upon, others 
will not confide in us, that a single act of dishonesty is 
sufficient to give one the reputation of being a thief or 
a liar, which cannot be offset by the advantages gained 
through telling a thousand truths. Children of eight 
or older will be helped by being told that the human 
face shows the thoughts within, that it is possible to 
read anybody’s mind in the eye, the window of the 
soul, that a little child comes from God with a clean 
white soul and has the face God gives him, but that 
years later he has the face which he gives himself, that 
if wicked thoughts occur often, wicked features are 
the result. This is one way in which we are punished 
for wrongdoing, just as Cain was marked on the brow. 
This is plain and simple. It helps the children to con- 
trol themselves, and they still need outside help in order 
to conquer their natural aversion to submission to 
authority.

228 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
How many parents whose children are not in their 
earliest formative years, are confronted with the pain- 
ful alternative of “letting things go,” or of using dras- 
tic measures to overcome the results of their own 
negligence, a crop of bad habits. When such is the 
case, I dare not tell you that you will find it easy to 
check naughty proclivities, or that the child can be set 
on the right path simply by persuasion. To mend what 
has been neglected for years requires not only the 
mother’s unlimited patience, but almost superhuman 
will power. But you need not and must not despair, 
for to say that bad habits cannot be overcome, and that 
efforts towards improvement are hopeless, would be to 
deny the goodness of God. Only when bad habits have 
persisted for years, it requires the codperation of the 
victim to root them out and supplant them with good. 
Those who succeed in overcoming their bad habits do 
so, not solely by an effort of will, but by repeatedly sub- 
stituting a good act for a bad inclination, step by step © 
on out habit with habit. There must first be some 
Afluence strong enough to make a brisk commence- 
ment and to keep up the new line of conduct for a 
certain length of time. Resolution, authority, example, 
any or all, may be the initiative that induces the person 
to persevere until the power of habit has had time to 
take effect. 
The great American, Benjamin Franklin, knew how 
to get rid of weeds and acted upon his knowledge. 
Listen! 
“T wished to live without committing any fault at 
any time,” he wrote. “As I knew, or thought I knew, 
what was right and wrong, I did not see why I might  
-P-A-G-E-237
  
Morals and Manners 229 
not always do the one and avoid the other. But I soon 
found that I had undertaken a task more difficult than 
I had imagined. While my care was employed in 
guarding against one fault, I was often surprised by 
another. Habit was sometimes too strong for reason. 
I concluded, at length, that the bad habits must be 
broken and the good ones acquired and established.” 
This young man thereupon made out a list of his 
faults. Instead of attempting to overcome all in a 
single day, he endeavored to avoid one fault for an 
entire week. Beginning with the first on the list, he 
went down the column week by week, through the 
entire thirteen faults. The first week he fought fault 
number one, the second week he fought fault number 
two and also continued to avoid number one; the third 
week he took fault number three for his special battle, 
not neglecting one and two. In this way he stead- 
fastly continued through all thirteen. Thus he learned 
to control himself, and because he could control him- 
self, he became a leader of men, one of the greatest 
thinkers of his day and one of the wisest among his 
contemporaries in the world. He proved that “He 
that ruleth his spirit is better than he that taketh a city.” 
Let us see how Franklin’s plan will work for chil- 
dren. In his list are four faults, very common indeed, 
which we may as well take for a month’s weeding task, 
one for each week. 
TALKATIVENESS. “Say only what may benefit your- 
self or others. Avoid trifling conversation.” 
DisorDERLINEsS. ‘Let all things have their places. 
Let each part of your business have its time.” 
WastEFULNeEss. “Waste nothing.”
-P-A-G-E-238
  230 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
InDoLENCE. “Lose no time. Be always employed 
in something useful. Cut off all unnecessary action.” 
Every child should attend most carefully to the first 
of these, since his main business is to learn, to gain 
knowledge, which “is obtained rather by the use of the 
ears than of the tongue.” Silence, joined to order, 
saves time. There are people who waste half their 
waking life through not having orderly homes and 
orderly minds. Frugality and industry will bring to 
each of us, as they brought to Franklin, the means of 
independence. It helps children in overcoming bad 
habits, to talk about being good a day at a time, which 
is long enough in any case. When a child of seven or 
older is trying to overcome a fault, teach him to keep 
a calendar, marking on it each night the result of the 
day’s efforts—a plus for success; a minus for failure; 
a question mark for doubtful.

CHAPTER XII 
LANGUAGE CULTURE IN THE HOME 
THE importance of early and adequate training in} 
oral language cannot be overstated, for nothing in the 
way of book-instruction can atone for its neglect, the 
English that we speak counting for more as an educa- 
tional test than the English that we write. We have it 
on good authority that 
“Words learned by rote a parrot may rehearse, 
But talking is not always to converse; 
As far removed from harmony divine 
The constant creaking of a country sign.” 
However, in our plea for upbuilding in each young 
mind the beautiful fabric of civilized human language, 
we have in view something of higher and deeper import 
than the mere ability to be entertaining or smooth- 
tongued or ready of wit, for while these and other 
embellishments are very nice and no doubt have a 
decided cultural value, theirs is not first place. The 
point is that the human mind resembles what it feeds 
upon, that it functions or does not function in an 
orderly manner according to whether or not it has been 
so trained, and that the period which determines men- 
tal complexion and mental furnishing begins in baby- 
hood and wanes before the age when wise parents 
place their children in school. 
The school cannot give adequate language-training. 
231 
 
-P-A-G-E-240
  232 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
Genius will not supply the child with a vocabulary nor 
will mere feelings teach him to connect words with 
each other and to apply them with accuracy; far less 
will bygone literary ancestors insure his preferring 
Shakespeare to the Sunday supplement. But the 
mother can do these things. Education, like charity, 
begins at home. The child is most unusual and unfor- 
tunate whose mother is not a better teacher than any in 
the classroom, the period between the ages of three 
and seven giving greater opportunity for mind devel- 
opment than does the entire school course. 
Teacher-mothers, there is nothing especially new or 
complex or technical in the requirements of your réle 
as teacher of English. If you can read you can give 
your child such language training as Plato himself 
would approve of. However unconscious of it you 
may be, practical lessons in English have already begun 
in earliest babyhood. You have prepared the child for 
instruction by teaching him to use a small number of 
words and to attach a meaning to those words. When 
talking to a child, when teaching him a little prayer, a 
little song, a nursery rhyme, you are all the time teach- 
ing him the English language. You belong to the 
grand league of teacher-mothers without being aware 
of it. 
Now by the use of equally simple methods adapted 
to a different age, you can so train. your children that 
they will be an example and inspiration to the whole 
community, showing the neighbors that education does 
not depend upon wealth, fine surroundings, or costly 
schools, but upon the patient care and watchfulness of 
God-fearing parents. 
The teacher-mother will find it easier to keep up 
 
-P-A-G-E-241
Language Culture in the Home 233 
lessons day after day if she keeps clearly before her 
the aim of language-teaching, which is to develop and 
train the mind, In detail this means: 
(1) To develop a gradually increasing vocabulary 
from the simplest beginnings; (2) to accustom the 
child to the use of good language; (3) to train him to 
state as facts only those things that are facts, at the 
same time not only allowing but encouraging him to 
indulge in imagination and fancy within certain limits; 
(4) to train him to express exactly and unmistakably 
what he means. There is no surer test of a good edu- 
cation than the ability to express exactly what one 
means. The child trained to see things as they are and 
to describe them exactly as he sees them, is acquiring 
a store of correct notions and ideas. By training him 
to think before speaking, we foster truthfulness, and 
by inculcating caution and exactness in speech we fos- 
ter habits of caution and exactness in all things. 
Our first need is a vocabulary, for without words 
we cannot express human feelings, we cannot acquire 
or create ideas. Without adequate word-drill school- 
ing falls flat. For instance, that too-common plaint, 
“My child has no mathematical ability,” means just 
this, that the child does not know the meaning of words 
and has never been taught that the first step towards 
learning mathematics, or learning anything else, is to 
find out what the words mean. On this point a judge 
remarked: “Half the cases that come before me for 
decision would never arise if the parties understood 
the exact meaning of the words employed in making 
agreements.” 
Language exercises a great influence on one’s mode 
of thinking, just as thinking influences language. The
-P-A-G-E-242
  234 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
wrong use of words creates careless and slovenly habits 
of mind. It is true that, even without conscious instruc- 
tion, almost everybody would learn to talk, just as it 
is also true that nearly everybody can get some sort of 
noise out of a piano, but you cannot expect clearness 
and conciseness of expression in those who are not 
drilled to it. Recall what a stumbling-block this is in 
school—the long-winded explanation a child will offer 
you when all you want to know is whether a lesson is 
understood or done. If you ask a child—or for that 
matter, a college graduate—whether he can tell you 
promptly how much nine times seven is, his answer will 
be “sixty-three,” whereas it ought to be “Yes.” 
What an advantage it would be if we could be 
trained to think of testifying before an impatient 
judge who wants to hear nothing but what is important 
and essential, and who refuses to listen to anything not 
to the point, however eloquently it may be expressed. 
A child so trained will not later attempt to describe 
earthquakes with motions of the hands, or to hide his 
lack of intelligent speech behind a few smart slang 
phrases which are supposed to express all ideas and 
emotions of the human mind. 
Here are a few general suggestions which each 
mother can work over into a method of her own: 
Teach many songs and poems indirectly, by singing 
or repeating them to the child, not like a set lesson. 
Do not urge him to repeat these until he is ready to do 
so. As one dear little twelve-year-old teacher said of 
her young brother: “If you try to make Teddy learn 
poetry he won’t listen at all, but when I just say it to 
myself like, he listens and says it after me.” Do not 
try to teach a poem that the child does not like or under-
-P-A-G-E-243
  Language Culture in the Home 235 
stand. The fodder must not be flung too high for the 
calf. 
Avoid complexity in your plan of instruction and 
never take a new step before the previous one is clearly 
understood and thoroughly mastered. It takes a little 
child a long time to visualize a new notion; for instance, 
it may take months for him to distinguish the differ- 
ence between past, present, and future. Never let him 
use such words before he thoroughly grasps them. It 
is too common to assume that a pupil understands a 
word if he can spell and pronounce it. Do not take 
for granted that the child knows common objects and 
the meaning of common words. No poem should be 
memorized unless preceded by careful word-study, 
whereby an unbroken series of distinct pictures is set 
up in the brain. 
An unusually intelligent little girl of nine who has 
always lived by the sea, and has had “geography les- 
sons” for two years in school, was taken out for a sail. 
When an island two miles out was sighted, she asked 
if that was “the other side of the ocean.” Another 
child of the same age, on learning that her mother had 
received in the afternoon a letter from her sister in 
England, asked: “Did Auntie write that letter this 
morning?” Such simplicity is natural and by no means 
undesirable, but we must recognize it and shape our 
instruction accordingly. Therefore, discourage the 
practice of memorizing without previously acquiring 
a clear understanding of the meaning and force of each 
word. Never teach a child words denoting things 
which he cannot comprehend, for words are useless 
lumber unless they symbolize an idea, that is, the pupil 
must connect the word unmistakably with the object  
-P-A-G-E-244
  236 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
or idea which it represents. Do not define in the same 
lesson two unknown words, or a word unrelated to that 
lesson. For instance, if you talk about clams while 
the child is memorizing Jack Horner, the chances are 
that in later years the name of Jack Horner will bring 
to his mind clams as well as plums. 
Do not read much at a time to a child. Imagine 
yourself in a picture gallery, where your desire is to 
stay before some one beautiful painting long enough 
to understand it, to realize its beauty, and enjoy it. 
You do not want the guide to hustle you recklessly 
along. While you read or speak to the child, you are 
flashing a series of pictures before his mind, each one 
new and wonderful, and you should give him time to 
ask questions about each of them, to get a true percep- 
tion or mental image of each. Crowding and cram- 
ming blunt the stimulus to learn and to know. 
Give daily training in speaking clearly and correctly 
and in answering precisely the question asked. Thus if 
you ask whether he has done so and so, do not allow 
him to form the habit of giving the explanation before 
he has answered “yes” or “no.” When asking a ques- 
tion, first make the child listen to it carefully and try 
to understand it, then make him answer that particular 
question, and not some question that he had hoped you 
might ask. For example: “Where is your cap?” 
Wrong answer: “I left it in the yard. Answer: “It 
is in the yard.” 
Allow children to have only such reading or pictures 
as are elevating in tone, and if the ‘“‘funny papers” 
are brought into your home, destroy them before they 
fall into their hands. Do not trouble children under 
eight or nine with lives of authors or painters, for as
-P-A-G-E-245
  Language Culture in the Home 237, 
yet they should have no thought for the artist, but 
should yield themselves to the beautiful object, the 
poem or the picture. Cultivate first the poetic taste, 
which belongs to a period earlier than the critical fac- 
ulty, the two phases of mind being, as a matter of fact, 
incompatible with one another. First learn from the 
poet, and later analyze his works and his life. It 
should be as though the poems wrote themselves, or 
just were. 
The language material for the period between the 
ages of two or three and seven should be mainly poetry. 
Poetry is the natural language of childhood, since it 
is the language of faith, of wonder, of high-wrought 
feeling. Simple, image-making poetry is our most 
natural available means of bridging the space between 
lack of knowledge and the beginnings of understand- 
ing. Whoever knows children is aware of their love 
of repetition and of exact statement. They want you 
to tell the same story at least a hundred times without 
changing it in the slightest. The ant and the grass- 
hopper must say good morning to each other in pre- 
cisely the same tone and manner every time; the wolf 
must use the self-same words each time he meets the 
little pig and he must never recover from his hoarse- 
ness. Poetry, being fixed in form, satisfies this hunger 
for repetition and exactness, and besides, the rhythm 
makes such a natural appeal that memorizing calls for 
no more than baby effort. 
That the memory should be thus exercised in early 
childhood is evidenced by the fact that it is the first of 
our mental faculties to be developed and used. It is 
a faculty which we share in common with the animals. 
Its continual exercise in laying up the treasures of the
-P-A-G-E-246
  238 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
poets, the precepts of the philosophers, the problems 
of the mathematicians, gave to the Greek mind a power 
of retention which nothing could easily escape. In 
addition to the new words which our little learner is 
gaining through observation-lessons, let us increase his 
vocabulary by teaching him simple epic poetry worth 
remembering for life, for in this way he learns to 
speak agreeably and correctly. Such memorizing gives 
abundant practice in the happy choice of words, idioms, 
phrases, in expressive, energetic language, in harmoni- 
ous combinations and sequences, thought is stimulated 
and the imagination is exalted. Teach simple Bible 
verses dealing with natural things and speaking of God 
in a simple manner, such as: “The eyes of the Lord 
are in every place, beholding the evil and the good”; 
“Hast thou seen a man diligent at his work? He shall 
stand before kings”; “Go to the ant, thou sluggard; 
consider her ways and be wise”; “Trust in the Lord 
with all thine heart.” Choose animal stories before 
fairy stories, for they come first in the order of nature, 
while fairy tales belong to a later age than seven or 
eight years. 
Accustom the child to use a sentence rather than a 
phrase in answering you, but do not forget that this 
can be done only during the regular lessons, for insist- 
ence upon such accuracy during ordinary, everyday life 
would be impossible and irrational. During the regu- 
lar lessons, however, the child will instinctively and 
naturally comply with the demand for an accuracy 
which becomes irksome in ordinary intercourse with 
others. 
Here is an outline of model lessons suitable for 
young children, beginning with the age of three, which 1,
-P-A-G-E-247
    
Language Culture in the Home 239 
the mother should supplement out of her own imagina- 
tion and inventiveness, which will grow by leaps and 
bounds when she calls them into play. The main thing 
that I hope to indicate in this space is the kind of mate- 
rial and teaching that may be safely given during this 
early age. 
SPECIAL METHODS 
(Natural and Inductive) 
ENGLISH 
1. Memorizing. 
2. General Information. 
s Spelling. 
Reading. 
These subjects should be taught in the order indi- 
cated, and in such a way that from the very beginning 
the second is taught in conjunction with the first. As 
the first step in teaching spelling, teach the child to 
analyze the spoken word into the sounds which compose 
it, and when this is understood, show by what letters 
these sounds are represented and teach the names of 
the letters, on the analogy that the child should know 
something of numbers before he learns the symbols, 
or figures. Next show that the same letter does not 
always represent the same sound, and that the same 
sound is not always represented by the same letter. 
Take very simple words of two or three letters, such 
as No, for instance. Have the child separate this word 
into the two sounds (not letters), N-o, without as yet 
giving the names of these letters. After the child has 
had practice in analyzing other words into the sounds 
composing them, teach him the names of the letters 
   
-P-A-G-E-248
240 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
representing these sounds, one at a time and very care- 
fully, as en, o. The teaching of reading should not be 
begun until sufficient progress has been made in the 
other three subjects. 
In teaching English, the teacher-mother should keep 
in mind the following aims: to develop and train the 
mind; to develop a gradually increasing vocabulary 
from the simplest beginners; to train the child to think 
before speaking; to form and develop the faculty of 
expressing exactly and unmistakably what is meant; 
to accustom and habituate the child to the use of cor- 
rect and good language; through habits of caution and 
exactness in speech, to foster truthfulness, as well as 
caution and exactness in all things; to make the child 
see things as they are and describe them exactly as he 
sees them, thus acquiring a store of correct notions and 
ideas; to enable the child to connect the notions and 
ideas so acquired with logical thoughts, and to express 
these in correct language; to train the child to state as 
facts only those things that are facts, at the same time 
not only allowing but encouraging him to indulge in 
imagination and fancy within certain limits. 
Do not try to teach the child a poem that he does 
not like or thoroughly understand; do not force on a 
child the moral of a story, or even suggest it, but leave 
it to the child to find it by instinct and intuition; do 
not teach prayers as a part of these lessons. Prayer 
should be kept apart as something sacred, confined to 
the intimacy between the child and the mother or fam- 
ily, and God. 
How to proceed in teaching English in all four 
departments : 
Follow instructions and method as outlined under 
 
-P-A-G-E-249
  Language Culture in the Home 241 
“How to Proceed” in “Object-Lessons and Observa- 
tions.” 
Make the child separate his teeth and open his mouth 
wide when speaking. Make him enunciate each word 
after you, distinctly and repeatedly, syllable by syllable. 
The articulation should be so careful that each single 
sound can be distinctly heard. The general lament 
over bad spelling is only too just, but such wretched 
spelling is primarily due to careless articulation and 
pronunciation in earliest youth. It rests with the 
teacher-mothers to remedy it by their patience and care, 
the schools being powerless without their help. Make 
the child take a breath before he speaks, and a new 
breath after each sentence; make him speak from the 
chest and not from the throat and sit or stand erect with 
chest expanded and shoulders thrown back. If you 
attend to these things there will be no need for so-called 
breathing exercises. 
From the beginning, make the child speak correctly 
during these lessons. This does not mean to bar all 
“baby talk” outside the lessons, which would be as 
unreasonable as to use only baby talk. Make the child 
give correctly the vowel-sounds—it, not ut; make him 
sound final consonants—and, not an’, eating, not eatin’; 
make him separate words—Jack Horner, not Jack- 
orner, pulled out, not pull dout, and the like. Other- 
wise, such slight neglects will develop into serious and 
incorrigible faults and habits. 
Do not allow the child to escape effort, or hide igno- 
tance, by vague replies. Where possible, suppress by 
ridicule all attempts at evasion, elusion, or prevarica- 
tion. Do not let the child trick you or get the better of 
you, or imagine that he does, or he will lose his respect
-P-A-G-E-250
  242 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
for you and you will lose your authority. If the child 
sees that you are weaker than himself in any one point, 
you might as well give up. If you yourself have made 
a mistake, acknowledge it at once, without hesitation 
or further comment, for if the child sees that you are 
strong enough to acknowledge your mistakes, he will 
follow your example. 
MEMORIZING 
FIRST YEAR 
For a model lesson we shall take the nursery rhyme: 
“Little Jack Horner 
Sat in a corner, 
Eating a Christmas pie; 
He put in his thumb 
And pulled out a plum, 
And said, ‘What a good boy am I!’” 
Sing or repeat these lines many times distinctly to 
the child. Then repeat the first few words and let him 
supply the next word when you pause, as: “Little 
    
  Jack ”: “Horner.” “Sat in a Ys “corner,” 
and so on. 
Then omit two or more words for the child to sup- 
ply, as: “Little ——”; “Jack Horner.” “Sat ah 
“Sn a corner,” and so on, until the child learns to recite 
the lines alone. 
Teach the child to suit action to the words, as at ‘“‘Sat 
in a corner,” let him run and sit in a corner. 
Ask questions, as : “What was the little boy’s name?” 
“His name was Jack Horner.” ‘Where did he sit?” 
“He sat in a corner.” “How many corners in this
-P-A-G-E-251
  Language Culture in the Home 243 
room?” “Show me the corner of the table.” “How 
many corners has this table?” “Is this a corner?” 
(indicating the edge). “No, that is an edge.” 
Make the child answer in complete sentences, teach- 
ing him to join words to phrases and phrases to sen- 
tences or clauses. 
Use words and phrases from the rhyme just men- 
tioned, in teaching the child to form simple, correct 
sentences, eliminating as much as possible the J, me, 
my, and so on. Here follow some examples of such 
sentences. 
This chair is little. 
Sister sat this morning by the table. (It is necessary 
here to add “this morning,” otherwise the child would 
not understand that sat refers to past time.) 
Now, mother sits by the able. 
That chair stands in the corner. 
Last night, Baby put her thumb into her mouth. 
Now, Baby puts: her spoon into her mouth. 
Following these examples, innumerable suitable sen- 
tences adapted to the local circumstances may be 
formed. 
Pronounce the word am; make the child repeat it 
after you. Then separate it into its two sounds (not 
letters) a-m, as directed earlier in this chapter, Make 
the child repeat these sounds after you. Let the child 
find words rhyming with am, as ham, clam, jam, in 
which way you can test whether he understands what 
is meant by a sound. Other suitable words are I, a, 
in. Teach the child that J and a are words of one 
sound, while am and in are words of two sounds. Be 
very careful that the child, in rendering these sounds, 
has the organs of speech in the correct position: for n, 
 
-P-A-G-E-252
  244. Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
teeth closed, lips separated, for J, mouth wide open. 
A noticeable pause should be made between each two 
succeeding sounds. 
Take the word in for sound-analysis. Let the child 
find words rhyming with im (tin, fin, pin, din, etc.) 
Make clear the meaning of such words and help the 
child to make little sentences to illustrate the use of 
each: This is a tin cup. The goldfish has a fin. The 
pin has a head and a point. Brother is making a din. 
SECOND YEAR 
For most children of four, such verses as the eight 
lines following may be taken as a model. 
“What does little birdie say, 
In her nest at peep of day? 
‘Let me fly,’ says little birdie, 
‘Mother, let me fly away.’ 
‘Birdie, rest a little longer, 
Till the little wings are stronger. 
So she rests a little longer, 
Then she flies away.” 
Before proceeding to teach the second year’s lessons 
on memorizing, teach the observation lessons described 
in Chapter VII for second year. 
When the child understands the terms long and 
longer as used therein, proceed in much the same way 
to teach him the meaning of a little longer. Have at 
hand several sticks, pencils, ribbons, towels, or similar 
objects, of various lengths. Tell the child to give you 
a certain stick; then to give you a much longer stick; 
then to give you a little longer stick. When the child
-P-A-G-E-253
    
Language Culture in the Home 245 
understands the meaning of little longer, as applied to 
concrete things, give him a lesson on a little longer, 
referring to time. “You may play a little longer,” 
“We shall stay a little longer,” etc. Teach the word 
stronger in a similar way, by making the child break 
bits of thread or twine, or pieces of wood of different 
thicknesses, to learn the meaning of stronger. Teach 
the pupil the meaning of “peep of day” by awakening 
him early to see the approaching dawn. When every 
word and expression in this stanza has thus been made 
clear to the child, proceed to teach the memorizing of 
it in the same way as in “Memorizing, First Year.” 
Now, hold with the child a dialogue based on this 
stanza, the mother being the mother-bird with the 
pupil the birdie. 
Cuitp. “Let me fly, mother, let me fly away.” 
Mortuer. “Birdie, rest a little longer, 
Till the little wings are stronger.” 
Now change the parts about, the mother being the 
birdie. 
After exhausting such dialogues, continue your 
questioning as follows: 
“Have you got wings?” 
“No, mother (or mamma), I have not any wings.” 
“What have you instead of wings?” 
“T have arms instead of wings.” (Or, “Instead of 
wings I have arms.” ) 
Thus the child begins to see that there is a similarity * 
between his body and that of the bird. He will prob- 
ably ask: “Why can I not fly, too?” to which a fitting 
answer is that God made the birds to fly, while He 
made us to walk upright. 
Make the child analyze the sounds of words as here-
-P-A-G-E-254
  246 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
inbefore directed. Take words of three sounds. Suit- 
able words in this stanza are let, fly, away, till, peep. 
Say nothing about silent letters, the child not having as 
yet learned about the letters. 
Find words rhyming with these as met, net, pet, 
wet, yet, bet, get, jet, set. Make sentences using these 
words. 
These lessons in sound-analysis need not be given 
every day, nor with many words, but only occasionally 
and with such suitable words as those listed. 
MEMORIZING 
THIRD YEAR 
The child of five will rejoice in that vigorous stanza 
from Browning’s “Pied Piper of Hamelin”: 
“Rats! 
They fought the dogs and killed the cats, 
And bit the babies in their cradles, 
And ate the cheeses out of the vats, 
And licked the soup from the cooks’ own ladles, 
Split open the kegs of salted sprats, 
Made nests inside men’s Sunday hats, 
And even spoiled the women’s chats, 
By drowning their speaking 
With shrieking and squeaking 
In fifty different sharps and flats.” 
Make the child understand that bit means did bite, 
and so on. While the child will readily understand 
that killed refers to past time, he will not so readily 
understand that fought, bit, and ate refer to past time 
and mean did fight, did bite, did eat. When the child
-P-A-G-E-255
    Language Culture in the Home 247 
understands every word in the first three lines, ending 
with “cradles,” make him memorize them, as in second 
year ; ask questions, such as: “What did the rats do?” 
and make the child tell you the three things thus far 
learned. Then: “Who fought the dogs?” “The rats 
fought the dogs.” “Who killed the cats?” and so on. 
Before beginning the next line, make certain that 
the child knows what a vat is. A vat is a large tub. 
In some countries, Switzerland, for instance, cheeses 
are made as large as cart-wheels, so they are kept in 
vats. A visit to the grocer might give the child an 
idea of the size of the whole cheese. As the rats 
attacked the cheeses in the vats, that is, before a human 
being could get a bite of them, they were not only 
greedy but impudent. 
Add the memorizing of this line to the previous 
ones. Continue in this way, explaining word by word 
the meaning of each line, then adding that line to the 
part memorized. Show the child a keg. If you have 
none, explain that it is a small cask. Show him a 
small herring, to make him understand sprats. Explain 
and illustrate “split open.” “Shrieking and squeaking 
in fifty different sharps and flats” may be illustrated 
on the piano or some other musical instrument by dis- 
cordant notes, or by the human voice in various high 
and low pitches. Explain that sharp and flat as used 
here have not their usual meaning; that “sharp”? mean 
high and “flat” means low. Let the child try to imit: 
these noises without getting out of the bounds of pr« 
priety. 
Let the memorizing keep pace with the explanations 
but never go before the understanding. 
If no live rats can be shown, show the child pictures   
-P-A-G-E-256
  248 Bookless Lessons for Teacher-M other 
of rats, and help him to make vivid mental pictures, 
such as the rats “‘licking the soup from the cooks’ own 
ladles.” Hungry rats will attack cats and dogs and 
even human beings. Do not give a morbid complexion 
to the passage, “‘bit the babies.” 
Make the child analyze the sounds of one word, or 
more, in each lesson, taking words of four sounds, as: 
rats, chats, hats, cats, vats, dogs, killed, cooks, open, 
kegs. Make him find rhyming words for fought, fight, 
bit, bite, eat, ate, keg, and so on. 
Make him form simple correct sentences using the 
words fight, fought; kill, killed; eat, ate; lick, licked; 
make, made; spoil, spoiled; and so on. 
MEMORIZING 
FOURTH YEAR 
For a model lesson we take the following poem: 
“Twinkle, twinkle, little star! 
How I wonder what you are, 
Up above the world so high, 
Like a diamond in the sky. 
“When the glorious sun is set, 
When the grass with dew is wet, 
Then you show your little light, 
Twinkle, twinkle, all the night. 
“In the dark blue sky you keep, 
And often through my curtains peep, 
For you never shut your eye 
Till the sun is in the sky.
-P-A-G-E-257
  Language Culture in the Home 249 
“As your bright and tiny spark 
Guides the traveler in the dark, 
Though I know not what you are, 
Twinkle, twinkle, little star.” 
The object-lessons on sun, stars, dew, sky and world 
should be taught before the memorizing of this poem, 
and an analogous procedure should be followed with 
all poems or passages to be memorized. 
Teach the meaning of all new words in the first 
stanza. By showing the child a distant light shining 
with interruptions explain the meaning of “winking” ; 
in this way friendly greetings could be exchanged in 
spite of great distances, just as we wave good-by and 
welcome to one another; show objects sparkling, as 
raindrops or dewdrops in the bright light, thus explain- 
ing the meaning of sparkle; then associate the three 
words wink, sparkle, and twinkle, to show that they 
have related meanings and that yet each word has its 
own uses, as: 
1. To close and open the eyelids rapidly—wink. 
(Illustrate. ) 
2. When a light seems to throw off sparks, as a 
red hot iron when hammered in the forge, we say it 
sparkles. 
3. When a bright light comes and goes rapidly at 
intervals, as if winking, we say it twinkles. 
Find further examples such as a drop of dew or a 
snow-crystal sparkling in the sunlight. In this way 
prepare the pupil for the important lessons in syno- 
nyms that should be given between seven and ten. 
In the evening, while the child gazes at the starry 
sky, the mother should seize the opportunity and recite 
 
-P-A-G-E-258
  250 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
aloud the first four lines. Let the pupil single out a 
conspicuous star, which he should try to find night 
after night, the mother reciting the lines to him each 
time. In this way is naturally brought about the con- 
tact of souls between mother and child, of which so 
much is spoken and written. 
Further suitable questions are such as these: 
“What color is the sky on a clear day?” “It is 
light blue.” 
“What color is it on a clear night?” “It is dark 
blue,” and so on. 
When the child knows by heart the first four lines, 
prepare him in the same way for learning the second 
stanza. 
Find synonyms for glorious, such as splendid. Help 
him to use the words correctly. Point out that these 
words are used figuratively, not literally, in such 
phrases as: “A glorious time,” “splendid fun.” 
After this stanza has been memorized, ask ques- 
tions, as: 
“When do the stars shine?” The answer should 
be found in the first line, then the second line, of the 
second stanza. 
“Where do the stars go when the sun is shining?” 
(The child’s answer will show you whether you have 
taught successfully the lesson on stars, and will give 
you the opportunity to clear up miscomprehensions. ) 
“Where does the dew go when the sun is shining?” 
(Follow hint under preceding question.) 
Proceed with the third and fourth stanzas, follow- 
ing directions as given for the first and second. 
Before giving the fourth stanza for memorizing, 
make clear the meaning of guides and traveler. To  
-P-A-G-E-259
Language Culture in the Home 251 
guide means to lead or to direct. Mother guides the 
child by the hand. The driver guides the horse by 
means of reins. Someone directs the stranger to the 
house which he seeks. The words pilot, conductor and 
the like, might here be taught to the child, associating 
them with to guide. In similar ways, make clear the 
words travel and traveler. 
FIRST LESSONS IN RHYTHM AND RHYME 
Recite aloud the line, “Twin’kle, twin’kle, lit’tle 
star’,” pausing after each word, pronouncing “twin- 
kle” almost as “twinkel.” (The accent or symbol ’” 
marks the syllable which has the stress or emphasis.) 
Make the child repeat carefully after you. Then ask: 
Which word is pronounced with one opening of the 
mouth? 
Ans. “Star.” 
“Star” is a word of only one syllable, which means 
that it is pronounced by opening the mouth once only 
or with one effort of the voice. 
“Little,” on the contrary, has two syllables and is 
pronounced with two efforts of the voice, almost as 
lit-tel. 
Now pronounce each word separately and ask how 
many syllables each contains. 
Ans. “Twinkle has two syllables; little has two syl- 
lables; star has one syllable.” 
Continue in this way, line by line, through the poem. 
Do not yield to the prevailing error that repetition is 
wearisome to the child. On the contrary, and for- 
tunately, it appeals to him and thus simplifies the teach- 
ing. Such lessons as these are like a game to him. 
Note his pleasure on detecting for the first time words 
 
-P-A-G-E-260
  252 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
of three syllables, as di’-a-mond, glo’-ri-ous, trav’- 
el-er. 
Now make the pupil repeat the first verse and scan 
the syllables, tapping the table with thumb and fingers 
alternately to keep the count. Give him time to realize 
the count—four stressed syllables plus three unac- 
cented. Do likewise with the second line. The pupil 
will notice that most of the lines have seven syllables. 
Let him continue thus throughout the poem, counting 
the syllables of every verse, finding the three exceptions 
to this uniform number of syllables. When finally 
reciting the poem, the scanning must be made subordi- 
nate to the natural pausing and pronouncing, but only 
in so much that the reciting does not seem to conflict 
with the colloquial way of speaking. 
The child will have learned from previous lessons 
that rhyming words contain similar sounds. Show 
him that in his poetry, the rhyming words recur at 
regular intervals. Rhyme is not a mere ornament, 
but may be compared to harmony in music. Repeat the 
first two lines of “Twinkle, twinkle, little star.” Make 
the child repeat and name the rhyming words. Make 
him find other words rhyming with star and are. Re- 
peat the third and fourth lines and make the child find 
the rhyming words. Make him find words rhyming 
with high and sky. Continue in this way throughout 
the poem. 
The liking for rhythm is simply and naturally culti- 
vated in young pupils by teaching them simple songs 
and poems. 
Continue the preparatory practice. 
1. Pronounce distinctly and slowly, in an even tone, 
the following words, making the child repeat them in
-P-A-G-E-261
Language Culture in the Home 253 
the same manner: ma-ple; bran-ches; seed-ling; nest- 
ling; swal-low; spar-row; rob-in; blue-bird. 
2. Repeat, making the pupil repeat one at a time 
after you, this time accenting the first syllable of each 
—ma'-pl; bran'-ches, etc—marking it by clapping the 
hands sharply. 
3. Count aloud twenty times, one-two, one-two; 
enunciate slowly and evenly, similarly to the ticking of 
a large clock. 
4. Repeat, saying one very loudly and two very 
softly each time. Speak evenly, steadily, keep time. 
This means, speak rhythmically, at a slow rate of 
speed. 
Repeat at moderate rate. 
Repeat fast. 
5. Repeat 4, clapping hands at one each time. 
6. Repeat 4, making a downward motion of the 
hand for one and an upward motion of the hand for 
two each time. 
7. Repeat the first four lines of “Twinkle, Twinkle, 
Little Star,” according to 4.

254 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
mically—metrically—throughout, not once but many 
times. 
10. Repeat 7, 8, and 9 with other poems having the 
same rhythm, as “What Does Little Birdie Say?” 
Make the child repeat after you, speaking distinctly, 
slowly and evenly, the following succession of words 
with two syllables: 
a-way’ ; re-turn’; sur-prise’; a-lone’; de-ny’; at-tack’ ; 
re-port’ ; ex-plode’ ; pro-voke’ ; con-ceal’ ; se-cure’ ; con- 
fess’; de-fend’ ; a-cross’. 
11. Again make the pupil repeat this list after you, 
accenting the second syllable of each word with both 
voice and hand-claps. 
12. Repeat 4, but this time speak one very softly 
and two very loudly each time, speaking steadily, keep- 
ing time with hand-claps, slowly, moderately fast, then 
at a fast rate. 
13. Repeat 12, beating time, making an upward 
motion of the hand for one and a downward motion 
for two each time. 
14. Repeat seven verses of the stanza beginning 
with: 
I 2 m2 m2 12 
They fought’ / the dogs’ / and killed’ / the cats, 
clapping hands at 2 each time and laying stress on 
every second syllable. 
15. Repeat, beating time as directed in 13. 
16. Drill the pupils on these exercises, using other 
poems having the same rhythm—two beats to a meas- 
ure; accent on second beat—as Stevenson’s “My bed 
is like a little boat,” Kingsley’s “Farewell,” Coleridge’s 
“He prayeth best who loveth best.”

MEMORIZING 
FIFTH YEAR 
For children of seven or older, let us take for a 
model lesson the first stanza from Browning’s “Pied 
Piper of Hamelin.” 
“Hamelin Town’s in Brunswick, 
By famous Hanover city; 
The river Weser, deep and wide, 
Washes its wall on the southern side; 
A pleasanter spot you never spied; 
But when begins my ditty, 
Almost five hundred years ago, 
To see the townsfolk suffer so 
From vermin, was a pity.” 
To the mother, the geographical allusions are pic- 
turesque but not correct, for Hamelin is not in Bruns- 
wick but in Hanover, the Weser at that point is neither 
deep nor wide—a man could wade across—nor does 
it wash the southern wall of Hamelin, for Hamelin is 
not a walled town. Do not, however, plague the child 
with such criticisms of poetic license, for at this age, 
the child takes no thought of the poem’s maker. 
In this and all succeeding lessons of the course, the 
mother should first study the selection with the aid of 
a good unabridged dictionary which illustrates with 
quotations the meanings of words defined. In this 
way she enriches her own store of learning, keeps her 
mind open and fresh for exercise, and forestalls the 
danger of her child’s feeling himself more intellectual 
than she after he enters school. Do not allow the child 
in speaking to you to use “won’t” and “can’t,” for he  
-P-A-G-E-264
256 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
should be more particular in talking to his mother than 
to others. 
The instructions for memorizing previously given 
should be applied to these lessons, with suitable enlarge- 
ments. Make the pupil understand first what each 
word means, then what each sentence (not each line) 
means, then what the first four lines mean. Point out 
that the ’s does not go with town, but means “is 
Town, city, and province should mean different 
things to the child. Make the meaning of the stanza 
clear by sketching a rough plan with chalk on your 
kitchen door, or with a stick in the center of the yard. 
Rub the plan out and let the child reproduce it from 
memory. Always use a horizontal surface for such 
lessons rather than a wall map, thus avoiding the pos- 
sibility of lasting confusion in the pupil’s mind. Rivers 
that climb heavenward, oceans standing on edge, the 
North Pole up and the South Pole down, remain to 
many troublesome misconceptions throughout life, 
owing to the use of maps shown in a vertical position. 
Attend carefully to the vowel sounds, the sounds of 
the final consonants, and the syllabification. Make the 
child speak from the chest and not through the nose. 
The emitted current of air should pass freely and unob- 
structed through the mouth, which will develop the 
lungs better than so-called calisthenics or elocution 
exercises. 
In the fifth line, what spot is meant? What does 
spy mean? “When begins my ditty” does not mean 
that the ditty was begun five hundred years ago, but 
that the story happened then, or thereabouts. Question 
about ditty. Have the pupil name ditties he has heard. 
By means of the seventh line, teach the child to form 
 
-P-A-G-E-265
  Language Culture in the Home 257 
some idea of long periods of time, for instance, long 
before the discovery of America. “Five hundred 
years” does not mean exactly five hundred years. Quote 
similar statements, as: “He has hundreds of friends,” 
which does not mean that his friends have been counted. 
A warning against exaggerations would be timely here. 
. Ask questions that make the child think about the 
meaning of words and the relations expressed by such 
simple words as to, from, away, towards, in, out. Ask 
the same question in as many different ways as you 
possibly can, and see that each answer fits the new form 
of the question. 
Discourage the practice of memorizing without get- 
ting a clear understanding of the meaning and force of 
each word. If you neglect careful word study the 
child may form the habit of aimless reading, and what 
he has read will pass through his mind as things pass 
through a sieve, the coarse things remaining and the 
finer things escaping. 
Repeat the first line, pausing after each word, and 
tell me how many words it contains. 
What is the first word? the fourth? third? second? 
Give the child time to find the correct answers; dis- 
courage hasty replies. Teach him to say, “I do not 
know,” instead of guessing. The main purpose of this 
exercise is to drill him to think before he speaks. Do 
not give too many of these drills in one lesson, but give 
frequent short lessons of this kind. 
Rhyming. 
Make the child find the rhyming words that mark the 
ends of eight lines. Which verse does not rhyme with 
another?
-P-A-G-E-266
258 Bookless Lessons for the Teacher-Mother 
In connection with this and numerous other lessons 
the thought will suggest itself to the teacher-mother 
that such instruction could be given with greater ease 
and dispatch in connection with reading lessons, the 
printed page being a ready mechanical aid to locating 
verse-endings, rhyming words, monosyllables, dissyl- 
lables, etc. All this is true, but mind-training is simi- 
lar to muscle-training, and it is not mere instruction, 
or knowledge, but use that gives strength that endures 
and power that achieves. Devise lessons that can be 
taught while the pupil stands, with his eyes on your 
eyes, instead of glued to a book. Make the lessons 
never too hard, but hard enough so that the child may 
experience the joy of attainment. 
Rhythm. 
Make the pupil repeat the first line and accent the 
first of each two beats, as directed in “Twinkle, Twin- 
kle, Little Star.” The other verses, except the fourth 
and fifth, have the accent on the second beat, as in 
“They fought the dogs and killed the cats.” Teach 
these also as before directed. 
Make the child repeat after you, speaking distinctly, 
slowly and evenly, the following succession of words: 
Mex'-i-can, car’-pen-ter, hol’-i-day, an’-i-mal, black’- 
ber-ry, chat’-ter-ing, Dec’-a-logue, sep’-a-rate, his’- 
to-ry, li’-bra-ry, cat’-a-logue, shat’-ter-ing. Repeat, 
clapping hands on first syllable of each word. Count, 
evenly and slowly, one-two-three, one-two-three, four 
times. Repeat, speaking ome very loudly and two- 
three very softly. Do this “in time,” or rhythmically. 
Repeat, clapping hands on ome. Beat triple time a 
number of times; hand motions: down—to the left—  
-P-A-G-E-267
  Language Culture in the Home 259 
up; down—to the left—up; and so on, slowly. Again 
count one-two-three, with the hand motions or beats, 
several times. Always beat down for the count one, 
tapping the table to accent it. Make the child keep 
time by counting your beats, and make him beat time 
also. Find verses written in triple measure: 
“Bird of the / wil'derness, / blithe’some and / cum‘ber- 
less,/ 
O! to a / bide’ in the / des’ert with / thee/.” 
Grammar. 
Explain and illustrate to the child that certain words 
are name-words. Mary is a name word. Village is 
a name-word. Ask: “What is your name? Your 
brother’s name?” etc. “What is the name of our post 
office?” “Name some of the things in this room.” 
“Name-words are called nouns. Repeat the first 
verse of the poem and tell me the name-words, or 
nouns.” 
“The name-words, or nouns, are Hamelin, town, 
Brunswick.” 
“Repeat the second verse and name the nouns.” Con- 
tinue thus until the child begins to recognize nouns 
without difficulty. Then give the definition: A noun 
is the name of a person, or a place, or other thing. 
Synonyms. 
These are words with nearly the same, or a similar 
meaning; as: town, city, village. Find synonyms for: 
famous, river, spot, to begin, etc,

PREFACE 
The purpose of this book is to give information concerning the 
methods by which upholstery work may be successfully carried 
on in school shops. The added beauty and comfort given to 
furniture by upholstery makes work of this character worth while. 
If period furniture is to be reproduced or modified, the worker 
must understand the art of upholstering. 
The tendency to reproduce or copy good old pieces of furniture 
should be encouraged, for only in this way may a student obtain 
a proper background, from which may be developed a new style. 
New ideas, derived from the best of the old, are likely to serve 
humanity in the best way. 
The study of the art of upholstery is an interesting one. It 
leads into many avenues of interest and profit, such as the history 
and methods of weaving; the processes of tanning and coloring; the 
manufacture and history of textiles; and the like. Such correlation 
is valuable, and each is distinctly educational. 
I wish to acknowledge my indebtedness to Prof. Chas. A. 
Bennett for valuable suggestions and inspiration; to David H. 
Tingwall for valuable help, and photographs; to A. C. Newell 
for suggestions on the outlines; to Wm. F. Tuttle for the photo- 
graphs of antiquarian furniture taken at the Art Institute of 
Chicago; to Bessie’ Bennett for certain information about the 
furniture; to John R. Fasier for the drawing in Fig. 28; and to my 
former and present Bradley students for inspiration and help. 
The practical contents have been verified and corroborated by 
Henry Euler, a practical upholsterer for fifty-nine years, and by 
Herman Schwartling who has followed the trade for thirty years.

CHAPTER I 
HisToRIcAL 
Upholstering in its broadest sense means the furnishing of a 
house with draperies, curtains and other hangings; bedding; cover- 
ings for couches, chairs and stools; and coverings for carriages and 
automobiles. 
The word upholster, or upholsterer, designates the workman who 
hangs the draperies and attaches textiles or leather to furniture. 
In the early days of the craft, as well as today, draperies had to 
be hung in a manner that assured retention of their shape, and 
textiles required stuffing and springs underneath to give the fabric 
permanent form. This holding up attribute led to the use of the 
words “upholder,” ‘‘upholster,” ‘“upholstering,’ and ‘“uphols- 
terer.” These applied also to furniture huxters who held up their 
wares for inspection when sold at auction. 
“The old time castle or baronial hall, with its strong stone walls 
and stone floors, was, so far as comfort went, little better than the 
clay hut of the feudal serf; but when the ladies of the baronial 
family had excogitated, or acquired the art of needlecraft, and had 
become proficient therein, the “up-holder”’ sprang into being, as a 
necessary adjunct to an important family. The ladies’ needlework 
(tapestry) was obviously adapted to drape the rude stone walls 
of the feudal hall, and the artisan who could drape or hang it 
effectively and without injury was a useful dependent, or trades- 
man, who, as he caused the tapestry to “hold up,’’ naturally be- 
came known as an “up-holder,” or “upholsterer.’’. 
“The Egyptians from the earliest times used upholstered 
couches, chairs, and footstools,” says Richard Bitmead. “It is 
known, too, that their neighbors, the Assyrians, excelled in weaving 
7
-P-A-G-E-7

and practiced the art of decorating draperies by the introduction 
of gold in the woof. The rich carpets of Persia and the muslins of 
India were in use for ages before the Romans set foot in Britain, 
and there can be little doubt but that the Oriental people raised 
the art to a very high standard, and long before the trade was 
known in Europe.) But at the present time, much more so than 
formerly, the progress of the arts, the refinements of taste, the 
caprice of fashion, and the habits and requirements of luxurious 
ease, which have extended to all classes. of society, have given a 
greater impetus to the trade and a far higher importance to the 
art of upholstery than it has ever before attained.” + 
Research shows that in the early seventeenth century, at the 
beginning of the Jacobean period, stools, chairs, settees and sofas 
were upholstered. Both seats and backs were padded and covered 
with leather or textiles. Sometimes, instead of tacking the goods 
onto the furniture itself, loose cushions were made to fit the frame. 
These cushions were called “squabs.” With the introduction of 
leather in upholstering, comfort was not the primary thought, but 
in common with all structures of the period, durability was a first 
consideration. So the leather utilized was thick and stiff, thus 
offering durability, but little comfort. 
The Flanders chair shown in Fig. 1 is done in leather. It is 
one of two side chairs from the seventeenth ‘century. One has 
a plain leather back; the other is tooled, illustrating a decorative 
coat of arms. The leather in this chair is made thick and rigid by 
the use of a stiff paper core, on both sides of which is glued a jute- 
like fabric, and over this the leather. This makes a five ply com- 
position of almost everlasting wearing qualities, but very sus- 
ceptible to checking and cracking. 
The arm chair shown in Fig. 2 is Italian, from the early seven- 
teenth century. It has carved finials. Webbing is used as.a founda- 
tion for the seat, over which a jute-like fabric is fastened. A canvas 
fabric is placed over this. The stuffing is placed over this and cov- 
ered with leather, which is nailed to the structure with large, flat,
-P-A-G-E-8

brass-headed nails. The edging isa fabric gimp with fringed edge. 
The arm chair illustrated in Fig. 3 is Italian, from the sixteenth 
century. It has carved finials but no turned work. The leather 
back is tooled, and gilded with an elaborate design. The leather 
seat has been blocked up from below to maintain the original 
appearance, and the leather is not the same grade as used on the 
back. Round headed nails, of two sizes, and the fringed gimp, com- 
plete the ornamentation. 
  
        
FIG. I FIG. 2 
The chair shown in Fig. 4 is an English ladder-back side chair 
from the seventeenth century. Here we have both comfort and 
practicability combined. The seat is built up with webbing, can- 
vas and stuffing, and covered with a needlework tapestry. It is 
finished with a fringed gimp with brass headed nails,

Not only does upholstery add comfort to furniture, but it re- 
flects the conditions in the life of a people. Alice F. Schmall said 
recently: ‘“ With the accession of James I to the throne of England 
the style of dress changed to trunk hose and padded doublet, and 
the carven forms of furniture gave place to upholstery. There is 
a sense of dignity and refinement about a really fine chair; and 
the modern upholstered chair, which Chippendale developed, shows 
           
FIG. 3 FIG. 4. 
that our ancestors were fully alive to its advantages in the way 
of comfort.” 
Good modern upholstery is to a great extent a copy of the older 
forms. Newer goods are utilized but old methods of application are 
retained. The cheaper forms of upholstery are, however, entirely 
modern. While formerly there existed no cheap upholstery, today 
wire and band iron are used in place of webbing, and tufting is done 
by machine. :
-P-A-G-E-10
CHAPTER II 
Toots AND MATERIALS 
TOOLS.—The only tools needed in simple upholstery, besides 
those in the average manual training shop, are a gimp hammer, 
a webbing stretcher, a pair of scissors, a regulator and straight 
and curved-needles. In Fig. 5, from left to right are illustrated: 
webbing stretcher, regulator, gimp hammer and a pair of scissors. 
The webbing stretcher may be made by driving nails into a 
formed piece of wood as shown, 3% inches wide by 7 inches long. 
Then cut or file off the heads and file each to a sharp point. 
The regulator is a long wire sharpened at one end and used for 
sticking thru the muslin cover to rearrange the stuffing, to 
insure evenness. This tool may be made from a heavy wire bent 
in the form of a ring at one end, and sharpened at the other. Scis- 
sors 8 inches or more in length are more convenient than smaller 
ones. 
Two needles are required, a straight double pointed one 12 
inches long, and a curved single pointed one 6 inches long. Several 
other kinds will facilitate work, however. A straight, double 
pointed 6-inch needle is convenient for sewing springs to webbing 
and triangular pointed needles are best adapted for sewing leather. 
Skewers are upholstery pins, usually 3 or 334 inches long. They 
are pointed on one end and bent in a circle on the other. These 
are used in doing welt-edged work, or wherever it is necessary to 
hold goods temporarily while adjusting the work. 
All these tools may be purchased from any firm dealing in up- 
holstery supplies. 
MATERIALS.—Webbing is our first consideration in the matter 
of materials. The two best kinds are L. M. C. and B. F. M. The 
former has a closer weave and is of better quality than the latter. 
It will withstand great strain before its elasticity gives out. It 
11
-P-A-G-E-11
12 FURNITURE UPHOLSTERY 
is good policy to purchase the better grade inasmuch as it costs 
but 30 cents more for a 72-yard piece. L. M. C. comes in two 
widths, 3% inch and 4% inch, with the former width in more gen- 
eral use. The 31% inch variety may be purchased for about $1.65 
per 72-yard roll. 
Burlap is the best material to use over webbing and over springs. 
It will not rip and tear as readily as most textiles and it is therefore 
a preferred material. Burlap comes in three weights: light (8 oz.), 
  
    
FIG. 5 
medium (ro oz.), and heavy (12 oz.). The medium weight is best 
adapted for our work. This may be purchased for 9 cents a yard. 
It is 40 inches wide. Used burlap may ordinarily be purchased at 
local dry-goods stores for about 5 cents per pound. Even consider- 
ing waste, this is much cheaper and quite as good as new burlap 
for the work intended. 
Several kinds of material may be employed for stuffing. The 
very best material available is curled horse hair. It is also the 
most expensive, costing from 30 to 65 cents per pound depending 
upon quality. The stuffing recommended for such work as ours is 
tow. This may be purchased by the roo-pound bale at a cost of 2
-P-A-G-E-12
ae k y als Tools Am mazerre! 
TOOLS AND MATERIALS ¢ 13 
cents per pound. There are three grades of tow: fine, medium and 
coarse. The fine variety should be used, for the coarser kinds are 
hard to manipulate and result in uneven surfaces after a period of 
use. Even with the medium grade of tow it is necessary to use a 
layer of wadding over it to prevent ridges showing thru tk: 
cover. Other stuffing materials are moss, kapok, alva, and ew} 
celsior. Cork shavings are generally used for boat cushions. | 
\When cloth is desired between the stuffing and cover, unbleache 
muslin should be used. In cheaper work this is eliminated. In 
our work we will find it advantageous, for it gives to the seat the 
proper shape, and permits better and smoother work on the final 
covering. After the application of the muslin, if it is found that the 
seat is not of the desired shape, more stuffing may be added or the 
stuffing may be distributed by the regulator. Muslin 36 inches wide 
may be obtained for 7 cents a yard from any local dry-goods store. 
Wadding is a kind of stuffing arranged in sheets. It is used over 
other stuffing. Its function is to give a smooth, even appearance 
to the séat or cushion. Wadding is invariably used over curled 
hair to prevent the ends of the hair from penetrating the cover. 
It may be purchased in sheets 30 x 36 inches; the one pound quality 
at 35 cents per dozen sheets. 
It is generally desirable to place cloth under the seat to prevent 
dust from falling to the floor from the seat, and to exclude moths 
from the stuffing. Cambric is desirable for this purpose. It has a 
finish which makes it dust-proof, but it tears easily and cannot 
supplant the muslin used over stuffing. Cambric comes in a 24- 
inch width and costs about 51% cents per yard. 
There are innumerable varieties of fabrics adapted for outside 
coverings, and good taste and judgment must be used in selecting 
proper kinds for certain jobs. It is obvious that office and library 
furniture require coverings of a different quality and kind from 
that of the living room; and dining room furniture from that of the 
bedroom. A footstool may properly be given a covering of different 
character from a chair seat. In the selection of figured goods great
-P-A-G-E-13
14 FURNITURE UPHOLSTERY 
discretion is necessary. The figures on fabrics for a chair seat or 
back should manifestly be smaller and more subdued than those for 
a sofa or davenport. A sense of good design needs to be developed 
here, for proper selection is essential, both as regards color, figure, 
and adaptability to the particular structure, and its placement. 
The first piece of tapestry woven in this country was completed 
in 1893. It was for a chair seat. The second was a counterpart 
of the first and is now in the Field Museum of Chicago. 
Tapestry may be defined as printing in colored threads. The 
most perfect work in tapestry is produced on vertical looms, but 
one-third more work may be accomplished on horizontal looms in 
the same length of time. A Gobelin workman on a vertical loom 
produces on an average, one square yard of tapestry in 300 working 
days. The art in this work is the graduation of shades. In the best 
days of tapestry weaving, between 1450and 1550, but twenty tosixty 
shades were known, while today we have knowledge of over 14,000. 
“Brocade” is the term applied to any material having a raised 
pattern. Formerly the name referred to materials with embroidered 
patterns upon colored fabrics. ‘Chintz’ is the term applied to 
cotton cloth printed with a floral or bird design. “Denim” is a 
strong, twilled cotton fabric. “Gunny” is jute-cloth. “Burlap” 
is a substitute for gunny cloth. 
There are three classes of coverings in upholstery: genuine 
leather, textiles, and leather substitutes. Leather substitutes, Gr 
so-called artificial leather, is well adapted for beginners in up- 
holstery, and is inexpensive. It is manufactured in 50 and 54-inch 
widths, and costs from 60 cents to $1.75 per yard. Trade names of 
leather substitute are Marokene, Chase Leather, Hercules, Victor 
Leather, Pantasote, Mole Skin, Mule Skin, etc. The better vari- 
eties are very durable and very closely resemble leather.) Genuine 
leather costs from 16 to 36 cents per square foot in the whole hide 
or full skin, and up to 75 cents per foot cut to size.) Cloth or textiles 
cost from $1.00 to $3.00 per yard in the general run of grades. They 
may cost as high as $10.00 per yard. Tapestry may run into 
prohibitive costs. Some of the best textiles are tapestries, brocades,
-P-A-G-E-14
TOOLS AND MATERIALS 15 
velvets, plushes, satins and hair cloth;) cheaper ones are velours 
chintz, reps, and denims. 
Gimp is a narrow edging used for covering raw edges of the cover 
and heads of common tacks which secure the cover. It comes in 
rolls of 25 to 36 yards. Black imitation leather gimp costs 20 
cents a roil of 25 yards, and brown or Spanish, 35 cents. Cloth 
gimp costs from 2 to 3 cents a yard. 
‘hree kinds of nails may be used in the work outlined: solid 
leather, Perfection and Metalene. Metalene is perhaps the most 
satisfactory. These come in the following numbers with attendant 
sizes; No. 230—Y-inch head; No. 240—34-inch head; No. 250— 
7g-inch head; No. 260—3%-inch head, and No. 270—34-inch head. 
No. 250 is used in our work. They cost 89 cents pez thousand in 
the plain, and go cents in Spanish effect 
Upholstery springs may be purchased from 3 to 16 inches in 
height. They cost 6 cents a pound and weigh from 22 to roo pounds 
per gross. On this basis the cost of the large ones approximates 44 
cents apiece. The g-inch springs are most frequently used, and 
their cost is a trifle over 2 cents apiece. It is better to purchase 
springs longer than necessary than to obtain them too short, for 
they may easily be tied down. They should be twice as long as 
the width of the rails into which they are placed. : 
Spring twine is needed for tying the springs. Ne. 60  six-ply 
Italian hemp serves this purpose very well. This can be purchased 
for 27 cents a pound in one-pound balls. 
Stitching twine is also needed for spring and stitched edge work. 
For this purpose No. 252 elm flax stitching is used. This costs 30 
cents per half-pound ball. 
The prices quoted are wholesale. Retail prices vary so much 
in different communities, and even in different places in the same 
community that they cannot be given with any fair degree of 
accuracy. The wholesale prices quoted will, however, give some 
idea of the cost of materials to the workman. At present, however, 
even wholesale prices are very unstable. All prices above are 
pre-war prices.

UPHOLSTERY WITHOUT SPRINGS 
CHAPTER III 
UPHOLSTERING A BOARD STRUCTURE 
A LOW FOOTSTOOL.—This project is chosen for the first 
work in upholstery for the reason that it involves the simplest 
processes possible. Nailing a piece of leather or strips of leather 
across a frame cannot be dignified by the term upholstery. There- 
fore, sich work is not to be considered under this head. The 
structure, in addition to the simple upholstery processes involved, 
requires but elementary bench work in wood in its construction. 
After staining the stool take a small amount of tow, pull it out 
thoroly with the hands until all uneven bunches are eliminated; 
then spread it out evenly on the top of the stool as illustrated in 
Fig. 6. Then place a piece of muslin over this, tacking it with 
4-0z. tacks 14 inch from the edges of the board. The muslin should 
be folded over on itself at the edges, and stretched very taut. 
Tack each side first, then work toward corners. This method of 
tacking insures a smooth, taut surface, and should be followed 
always. Use the regulator, Fig. 7, to even out any irregularities 
and to force the tow well out toward the outer edges of the muslin. 
Then lay a piece of wadding over this to make a smooth surface; 
see Fig. 7. Next stretch a piece of Marokene leather of the color 
desired over the previous layers and secure it with 214-0z. tacks. 
These should be placed about 2 inches apart, 14 inch from the edges 
of the stool, and surplus fabric trimmed to 1 inch from edges. 
Finally, cut a piece of gimp and secure with Metalene nails as 
shown in Fig. 8. Fold the gimp at the corners and splice at the last 
corner. Place the nails equal distances apart on parallel edges. 
16
-P-A-G-E-16
UPHOLSTERING A BOARD STRUCTURE 17 
Be sure that the leather, gimp and nails harmonize with each other 
and these with the final color of the stool. 
A CART.—The different processes for upholstering a cart, illus- 
trated in Fig. 9, are idehtical to those just described, with the 
exception that a margin is left at the edges of the seat. The cart 
  
    
FIG. 6 
suggests a very practical application of simple upholstery, either 
in covering a wood seat or in replacing a worn upholstered seat. 
A LEG REST.—The processes of upholstering the leg rest shown 
in Fig. 10 vary substantially from those already discussed. Here 
is the first introduction to a hard edge. Reference to Fig. 10 will 
show how this edge is made. Chamfer the upper arris of the seat 
as wide as the tack head and drive the tacks in at right angles to 
the chamfer. This method avoids splitting the corners. The near 
side of the illustration shows a piece of burlap tacked with two- 
thirds of its width overhanging. Use 4-o0z. tacks for this purpose, 
and tack in such a way that the heads of the tacks are even with 
the edge of the seat, 
After the burlap has been secured in this way insert a small roll  
-P-A-G-E-17
18 FURNITURE UPHOLSTERY 
of tow or a strand or two of welt cord under the burlap at the edge 
of the seat. The diameter of this roll may vary from 14 to 14 inch 
as desired. Bring the burlap over and around the firmly packed 
tow or cord, and tack down extremely close to the roll, keeping the 
roll round. Special effort should be made to keep the roll smooth 
  
  
    
FIG. 7 
and even, for its form determines the final form. The rear side of 
the illustration, Fig. 10, shows the completed roll. 
Strips of webbing may be employed in place of burlap. Webbing 
is a closer woven fabric than burlap, and in consequence produces 
a more even roll. And webbing cord is preferable to tow for it re- 
quires less time to place and results in a smooth edging. 
The strip of soft wood shown in the illustration is called an 
upholstery block. Gimp and muslin are secured to this block. 
Without these blocks, one at each end, the cover could not be 
placed without much labor and resulting unsightly folds at the 
corners. 
After the corner strips are placed and the rolls formed, place  
-P-A-G-E-18
UPHOLSTERING A BOARD STRUCTURE 19 
sufficient tow on the seat to produce a slightly rounded top when 
the tow is pressed down firmly with the hands. The tow must be 
picked, that is, pulled out thoroly to make it even and fluffy. 
Place over this a piece of muslin, tacking it temporarily at the 
center of each side with several 2!4-0z. tacks. These should be 
  
        
FIG. 8 
only partly driven, a process called slip-tacking or loose-tacking. 
Stretch it tightly, and bring the threads of the muslin in line with 
the edges of the seat. Next pull out the tacks from one side and 
re-stretch the muslin by stroking it several times with the left 
hand, always holding it with the right. Do this on each side in 
succession. An expert workman will hold the tacks in his mouth and 
the hammer in the right hand during the whole process. After the 
muslin has been placed use the regulator and re-distribute the tow 
should any unevenness exist. This process is called regulating.
-P-A-G-E-19
20 - FURNITURE UPHOLSTERY 
Next place the cover. Whether it be genuine leather, leather 
substitute or textile fabric, proceed as with the muslin omitting 
folding the edges. Stretch the cover tightly and tack with 214-oz. 
tacks. Place the tacks a small fraction of an inch from the lower 
edge of the board so the trimming of the cover may be easily done. 
Apply the gimp. This covers the raw edges of the materials and 
  
  
    
FIG. 9 
tack heads. Start at the right-hand corner, fastening it with a 
2%-oz. tack. Carry it across to the left-hand corner and fasten 
with another tack. Fold it upon itself so as to form a definite crease 
then twist it over and carry it up and along the soft wood strip 
to the next corner. Repeat this process to the starting point; then 
cut the gimp off flush with the bottom of the board and secure with 
a tack. As the forty-five degree folds are made, the gimp nails 
should also be driven in place. Fig. 11 shows the steps in 
making the folds at the corners. Space distances equally and 
place all gimp nails. A dedrable distance is from 1% to 214 
inches—depending on the cover material. A quick way to place
-P-A-G-E-20
UPHOLSTERING A BOARD STRUCTURE 2) 
these nails is to drive a nail in the middle of an edge, then ome in 
the half way points between this and each corner, and so on. This 
process gives good eye training. Fig. 12 shows completed leg rest. 
A FOOTSTOOL.— The upholstery operations on the stoo 
shown in Fig. ‘3 are very similar to those on the leg rest. The 
rolls are formed identically but are placed on four sides. Special

line with other parts of the rolls. The cover nceds folding at the

corners to make it smooth. The gimp runs continuously around 
the edge without folds. This form of stool requires a greater amount 
of upholstery material than the first form, and is not as pleasing in 
structural design, but is a more comfortable structure.

that of the dining chair. The processes involved are very simple.

A shallow rabbet should. be run along the inside edges of the seat 
frame, say about 1 inch deep and 34 inch wide. This will permit 
the gimp to run flush with the top of the seat frame when all work 
is completed. 
First decide on the number of lengths of webbing that will be 
required for thegivenarea. Then, using 
the best of webbing, take one end and 
tack with ro-oz. tacks. If hard wood 
is used in the structure and it tends to 
split, use smaller tacks, say 8-oz. or 
6-oz. Stretch the strand of webbing 
with the webbing stretcher, and tack as 
illustrated in Fig. 23. 
When four tacks have been driven in 
cut the webbing off 1 inch beyond the 
row of tacks; fold over, and tack down 
with three tacks placed between the 
four previous ones. Folding the ends 
over rather than under is better -prac- 
tice, for the fold protects the webbing 
at the points of greatest strain. Use as 
many tacks as the wood will permit, 
for many tacks distribute the strain’ 
over all threads of the webbing. After” 
the lengths of webbing have been at- 
tached from front to back weave lengths 
thru these from side to side as shown 
in Fig.r4, and secure in the same manner. The illustration 
shows the underside of the seat. 
Next tack burlap over the webbing with 4-oz. tacks. Cut the 
burlap slightly larger than the opening, including the rabbet, and 
fold the edges over in tacking. Stretch the burlap slightly to pre- 
vent sagging in the opening, but not so tight that the webbing will 
not support practically all the weight.

Now place the stuffing, tow, picking it and working it into shape. 
Over this secure muslin and then lay a sheet or two of blue-sheet 
wadding over all. Place the leather substitute, and the gimp and

processes have been described and need no repetition here. The 
finished seat frame is shown on a dining chair in Fig. 16. The 
back of the chair is also upholstered, practically in a manner iden- 
tical to the seat. On the rear of this back a piece of leather sub-

stitute of same color and finish as the front is tacked and the edges 
covered with gimp. It is a good practice to tack a piece of cambric 
under the seat frame for sanitary reasons indicated in a previous 
chapter. 
A SET-IN SEAT.—This form of seat is very convenient for any 
chair or stool where a set-in 
seat is desired. Cleats on 
which the seat rests may be 
screwed or nailed to the rails, 
or the rails may be rabbetted 
to receive them. Corner 
blocks may also be utilized 
for the purpose. In addition 
the seat may be fastened to 
these rests with screws. This 
usually prevents the chair 
from squeaking, due to a 
loose seat. 
In constructing the wood 
frame for this kind of seat 
allow at least 33; inch for 
the thickness of materials. 
More allowance should be 
made for thick material and 
genuine leather. 
    FIG. 19 
Attach webbing and burlap in the usual manner; then form the 
hard edge as described previously. The hard edge is shown in 
Fig. 17 together with tow, wadding, and muslin, and Fig. 18 shows 
the seat ready for the covering after the trimming of the raw edges. 
The finished seat placed in a rocker is illustrated in Fig. 19.

FOOTSTOOL.—A stool which makes a very interesting problem 
for simple upholstery is shown in Fig. 20. This is typical of that 
class of structures on which the coverings completely hide the 
rails, leaving only the legs exposed. The rails should be placed 38 
inch below the rounded part of the legs, and be at least 76 inch ee ee ee 
     
FIG. 20 
thick. Inside arrises of the rails should be rounded with a rasp to 
prevent the webbing from eventually being cut thru. The frame- 
work of such a structure is shown in Fig. 21. Attach the 
corner blocks as shown in Fig. 22; then properly stretch the webbing 
and tack it in place. The webbing is the ground work of upholster- 
ing, and the durability of the work depends to a considerable 
degree upon its quality and proper application. Use the original 
roll of webbing. This enables the worker to use the webbing 
stretcher without waste. Both ends should be used. This permits 
the utilization of the two free ends, and allows freer work. Fig. 23 
illustrates the method of using the webbing stretcher. 
28
-P-A-G-E-28
UPHOLSTERING A FRAMED STRUCTURE 29 
PROCEDURE.—Fold the end of the webbing over about 1 inch 
and tack with five 10-0z. tacks as near the middle of the rail as 
possible. This is illustrated in Fig. 24. The ends of the webbing 
should be folded over and not under, as suggested before.. The tacks 
will hold better. The middle length of webbing should be placed 
first to facilitate equal spacing between strands. The other ‘free 
end of the bolt of webbing should be tacked on the opposite side   
  
    
FIG. 21 
in like manner to assure proper spacing. Fig. 24 shows the ends 
tacked and stretched from the same side, but in tacking them from 
the opposite sides it tends to prevent splitting, for the last. ends 
are to be secured with seven tacks. After the first end is secured 
with five tacks use the webbing stretcher and pull the webbing 
across, extremely taut, and fasten with four tacks while thus 
stretched. Do likewise with the second strand. Cut each piece 
about an inch from the tacks; then fold over and tack with three 
tacks. Before tacking the two long strands they should be woven 
thru the shorter strands as illustrated in Fig. 24. The openings 
between strands should not exceed 2 inches.

Cover the webbing with burlap. he 
edges of this should project slightly be- 
yond the ends of the webbing, as illus- 
trated in Fig. 25. 
It is desirable, in fact essential, in 
all upholstery to keep the cover away 
from the wood as much as possible. 
This prevents the cover from becoming 
worn or cut, and avoids a hard, uncom- 
fortable edge for the occupant of the 
upholstered structure.

UPHOLSTERING A FRAMED STRUCTURE 31 
A simple expedient to avoid this contact with wood is to attach 
a hard edge all around the top of the rail. This edge is made by 
tacking strips of burlap on in such a manner that tow may 
be rolled in them. They are then retacked behind the roll. The 
first row of tacks should be placed so that, the heads run flush 
with the outer edge of the rail. The strip of burlap on the farther 
  
      
FIG. 24 
side of the stool shown in Fig. 26 is fastened in this way. The roll 
on the near side is complete. On the left end the burlap is shown 
partly rolled back to reveal the tow in place. The tow must be 
thoroly worked in with the finger to produce an even, smooth edge, 
and the burlap drawn tight to make it firm. 
Fig. 27 shows all four rolls in place ready for the corner or up- 
holstery blocks, providing the first form of corner blocks illustrated 
in Fig. 22 have not been attached. The first form of block is pre- 
ferred by most workman. In Fig. 26 is shown the second form of
-P-A-G-E-31

corner block in place. This is fitted behind the rolls, and is cut 
in a manner to avoid short grain, which has a tendency to split. 
Corner blocks are required when gimp is run continuous around the 
edge of the cover. These are secured with several brads, against 
  
        
HIG. 25 
both postsand rails. Take tow and pick it over thoroly; then place 
it upon the stool making a rounded heap from the top edges of 
the rolls. Pack and work into place very thoroly to secure an 
even seat. The hands easily detect uneven areas, and may be 
more readily depended upon than the eyes.

Now stretch and tack the muslin in place. Fig. 28 shows the 
processes completed. Slip-tack it in the centers of four sides with 
two or three tacks to a side. Slit the muslin diagonally from the 
corners to a point immediately inside the legs. Fold the edges 
under; work from the center toward the corners, and tack the mus- 
lin permanently, Keep the muslin smooth and drawn tightly. 
    
FIG. 28 
The covering is placed practically in the same manner as the 
muslin. Great care must be exercised to avoid cutting too far at 
the corners, to have the material fit snugly, and to have the whole 
job firm and smooth. If, after the gimp has been placed, portions 
of the covering show below, these may be trimmed easily with a 
sharp knife or chisel.

DIFFERENT METHODS.—This type of footstool may be 
treated in a variety of ways. Webbing may be omitted as a 
base for the upholstery and a board substituted, preferably 
some thin stock. Instead of bringing the cover down to the 
lower edge of the rails as in Fig. 20, a shallow rabbet may 
be run and the upholstery brought to the edge of this as 
shown in Fig. 31. Or it may be treated in the manner shown 
on the footstool illustrated in Fig. 30. In this instance it 
would be similar to a pad seat. The rails of the stool should here 
be placed even with the chamfer on.the legs. The stool may also 
be upholstered with a welt edge: “This method is very desirable 
when the worker is limited to small pieces of tapestry or leather. 
Welt-edged work will be described in a chapter on spring-edge 
work. .
-P-A-G-E-37
PART II 
UPHOLSTERY WITH SPRINGS 
CHAPTER VI 
MAaAKInc A Harp-EDGE SEAT 
The hard-edge seat as it is technically termed is relatively simple 
when compared with other kinds of upholstering, but it is probably 
the most important of the group. The edge of the seat needs to be 
stuffed and sewed in a manner that makes it hard and firm, while 
the center is springy. With a working knowledge of this class of 
upholstery one may make some of the finest pieces of furniture 
without difficulty. The directions to be given may be modified to 
suit any particular piece of work in this group. 
METHOD.—Construct a frame 18 x 24 inches outside dimen- 
sions, and 3 inches deep. Employ a simple butt joint, secured with 
nails and reinforced with corner blocks as shown in Fig. 32. A 
light, close-grained wood, as poplar, basswood or pine is preferred 
to hard, open-grained wood. 
The webbing is fastened in place as described in Chapter V, using 
but three strands crosswise and two the lengthwise of the frame. 
This is a different type of work, and the suggestions as to spacing 
do not apply here as in the footstool just described. The webbing 
is placed so that the springs, six in number, stand over the laps. 
A distance of about 3 inches:should be left between the outer edge 
of the frame and the springs. The webbing is 314 inches wide, and 
the No. 3 springs used are 5 inches across. These dimensions deter- 
mine that the strands of webbing should be 334 inches from the 
outer edge of the frame. 
Place springs in position turning the bent ends up. Sew these 
to the webbing with stitching twine using a 6 or 12 inch double- 
38
-P-A-G-E-38
MAKING A HARD-EDGE SEAT 39 
pointed needle. Make at least three loops around the bottom coil, 
fastening it securely to the webbing. Pull the twine taut and tie 
the final end to a nearby stitch. Fig. 33 illustrates the method 
of sewing. 
  
  
  <a 
FIG. 32 
Next the springs are tied with spring twine to keep them in an 
upright position, and to prevent breaking down and bending. 
The twine also supports the burlap and stuffing above it. After 
the springs are tied down the twine should receive all the pull from 
the reaction. Upon the permanency of the webbing and spring 
twine depend the lasting qualities of the seat. The twine generally 
deteriorates or breaks first, and then the webbing. To insure a 
relatively permanent seat tie the springs eight times, that is, place 
four strands across each spring, one from front to back, one from
-P-A-G-E-39
40 FURNITURE UPHOLSTERY 
ide to side, and two diagonals. Multiply the dimension of the 
frame by one and two-thirds to determine the lengths of twine 
required. 
THE PROCESS.—Tie a simple Knot in one end of a length of 
twine. Drive a ro-oz. tack thru this into the top edge of the frame 
  
    
    
FIG. 33 
and in line with the ceXtre of the spring. Then stretch the twine 
across the top of the springs to the opposite side of the frame; pull 
the springs down with it until the outer side of the coil is about 
6 inches from the bottom and the inner side about 7 inches. Ad- 
just the springs to stand vertical. Grasp the twine and spring 
nearest the fastened end with the thumb and forefinger of the 
left hand; hold them, while with the right hand pass the free end 
‘of the twine down inside the coil, up on the left hand side of the 
fastened end, down inside the coil again, up on the right hand side 
of the fastened end, and thru loop thus formed. Pull it tight.
-P-A-G-E-40
MAKING A HARD-EDGE SEAT 41 
This is called a clove hitch knot. Its advantage is that it does not 
loosen even after the twine over the top of the wire wears off. 
With the easier knot the entire twine loosens immediately after 
the top wears.’ A careful examination of Fig. 34, and a little 
practice will clarify the method just described. Pull the twine taut 
  
  
      
FIG. 34 
to the other side of the coil and form another knot. This time, 
however, the twine is passed down onthe outside of the coil first 
and up on the inside. Before tying the second spring space it at 
the topa distance equal to that at the bottom. When the second end 
isto be tied, drivea tack part way into the edge of the frame and wind 
the twine once and a quarter around it, pull it tight enough to 
bring the springs down properly, and drive tack securely. Drive 
a second tack close to the one at the end. The twine should be
-P-A-G-E-41
42 FURNITURE UPHOLSTERY 
fastened in just this way so that in moving up and down with the 
springs it will not wear away against the head of the tack. 
\ All other twines are fastened and tied in practically the same 
manner. However, care must be exercised that the springs are 
not drawn down lower with successive strands of twine, or an un- 
even strain and wear will result. The last twine should be tied 
  
      
FIG. 35 
to all others crossing at the spring centers, to prevent twine wearing 
at these points. A study of Fig. 34 should make clear any doubtful 
point. 
Tack a piece of 10 or 12-0z. burlap on the top edge of the frame 
with 4-0z. tacks, folding the edges over as they are being tacked. 
Fasten it just tight enough to insure smoothness, avoiding pulling 
the springs down lower, As previously stated all spring reaction 
straih should fall on the twine exclusively. Sew the burlap to the 
springs with a curved needle and stitching twine. This keeps the 
burlap in position, prevents wearing, and helps to unify the seat.
-P-A-G-E-42
MAKING A HARD-EDGE SEAT 43 
Place the stuffing. Work over about 5 pounds of tow, and work 
it down and out over the seat until it extends about 3‘inches beyond 
the frame as shown to the left of Fig. 35. Be careful to keep the 
tow even at all times, especially at the edges. 
/ Place a piece of light burlap, 6 or 8-oz. weight over the tow. It 
should be large enough to be slip-tacked on the sides of the frame. 
  
      
  Stitch thru the two layers of burlap and the tow with a 12-inch 
double-pointed needle. The row of stitching should come just 
outside the edge of the springs. Each stitch should be about 3 
inches long, and it is formed by passing the needle up and down 
thru the burlap. After all-four sides have been stitched pull the 
twine tight. Begin at the first stitch and pull each taut in succes- 
sion. Finally take a few stitches thru the center of the seat at 
irregular intervals, thus making the seat firm and compact. Do 
not stitch around the loose coils of the springs.
-P-A-G-E-43
44 FURNITURE UPHOLSTERY 
  
    FIG. 37 
        
FIG. 38
-P-A-G-E-44
MAKING A HARD-EDGE SEAT 45 
Now release the slip tacking and roll the loose edges of the burlap 
under the tow. Drive tacks thru that part of the burlap which 
comes in contact with the top edge of the frame, beginning at 
the center of each of the four sides and working toward the corners. 
Use precaution to make all sides equal. Tack the corners last. 
Should they be too full, due to the overlapping of the burlap, cut 
away some burlap and remove the necessary amount of tow to keep 
the corner even with the sides. 
We now arrive at that process in the development of the seat 
from which this class of upholstery derives its name. The stitching 
of the rolled edge already formed is rather difficult, and care must 
be exercised to assure a neat appearing seat. Stitch the edge around 
to the number of two or three rows. Use a 6-inch curved needle, 
and beginning at the leftthand end of one of the rolls, start the 
needleabout 114 inches from the row of tacks, and allow it to emerge 
about 1}4 inches from the row of stitching. About 1% inches to the 
right insert the needle into the roll again about 34 inch from the row 
of stitching, and allow it to emerge about 34 inch from the row of 
tacks. Tie the end of the twine around the other with a double slip 
knot. Insert the needle again about 114 inches to the right, up thru 
the roll, and down as before. Repeat this operation around the four 
sides of the seat, regulating as the stitching progresses. The right- 
hand needle in Fig. 36 shows the first row of stitching. Always 
insert the needle at a rizht angle to the roll, for the arc of the needle 
gathers in considerable tow which is forced into the roll as the 
twine is pulled taut. 
The second row of stitching is also illustrated in Fig. 36. The 
stitches in this operation are not made in a zig-zag manner as in 
the first row. The needle is inserted about 14 inch above the first 
row of stitching and allowed to emerge at the same distance on top. 
Work to the left at an interval of 34 inch and use the double slip knot 
as previously. Pass the needle to the right about 234 inches and 
insert it as at first, then carry it back again about 34 inch and push 
it thru the roll allowing the end to project; then loop the twine
-P-A-G-E-45
46 FURNITURE UPHOLSTERY 
around the point. See left-hand needle in Fig. 36. Repeat onall four 
sides. After the second row of stitching is completed a third row of 
stitching may be made. Then place more stuffing on the top of the 
seat, rounding out all irregularities. This is called double stuffing, 
and work of this kind is termed double stuffed work. Hair is 
extremely resilient, and used for this purpose adds life to the seat. 
  
  
    
FIG. 39 
Moss will answer the purpose. Place a layer of cotton batting 
over this. ‘Then a piece of muslin is finally tacked over all. 
Fig. 37 shows the muslin partly tacked, and the two layers of 
material rolled back. Keep the muslin smooth, especially at 
the corners, cutting away all surplus material. 
Use a cover of soft material rather than one of leather-or sub- 
stitutes. Secure it in place like the muslin, only tack it under 
the lower edges of the frame and fold it carefully at the corners as 
illustrated in Fig. 38. The process of blind stitching is plainly 
shown. When the seat has been covered tack a piece of cambric 
underneath. The hard-edge seat is then finished. Fig. 39 shows 
the completed cricket.

A QUEEN ANNE STOOL.—This stool also has a hard-edge 
seat but the method followed is a modification of the one just 
described. In the former the upholstered seat was built over a box 
or frame, and fitted snugly into the cricket base. In this project 
he upholstery is fastened permanently to the rails; it becomes an 
  
    
    
    
  FIG. 40 FIG. 41 
integral part of the structure. The edge is blind stitched. The 
webbing cannot be tacked directly to the rails; they are too weak 
to withstand the strain, and in this instance are curved or formed, 
which precludes tacking webbing underneath. In such instances 
the webbing is folded several times and tacked thru the folds 
against the inner sides of the rail. If the rails are not sufficiently 
strong strips may be screwed on as reinforcement. This has been 
done in this instance as shown in Fig. 42. Frequently on such 
structures a brace or two is placed across between the long rails.
-P-A-G-E-47
48 FURNITURE UPHOLSTERY 
The identical method of upholstering is followed from this 
point on as in the cricket, up to the point of stuffing. This seat 
is shallow requiring considerably less tow. Place just a sufficient 
amount to prevent the springs from being felt under pressure from 
the hand; then place and secure the burlap in the usual manner. 
Next sew the hard edge with a 12 inch straight double-pointed 
needle. Begin about 34 inch above the rail, and permit the needle 
  
    
FIG. 42 
to emerge above about 4 inches from the edge. The left-hand 
needle in Fig. 43 shows the method. Pull, the needle up to its eye 
as shown in the middle needle; then bend the point toward the 
lower edge. As it emerges toward the right loop the twine around 
the needle and pull it thru. This brings the twine around the tow, 
pulls it down firmly toward the lower edge and holds it there. This 
operation is frequently called blind hard-edge stitching. The 
Frontispiece shows the finished stool, and Fig. 44 another stool 
employing the same form of seat.

CHAPTER VII 
RE-UPHOLSTERING 
The first evidence of.deterioration in much old spring upholstered 
furniture is a sagging seat. If,attended to at the first indication of 
sag the fault may be remedied by simply retacking the webbing 
P| WoC saos:. lielveuhas pulled 
away from the rails. If the sag is 
not remedied shortly the stuffing 
begins to shift, and “the exposed 
springs will soon cut or wear a 
hole thru the cover. Then the 
seat is practically beyond repair, 
with theexception.of the utiliza- 
tion of the springs. . Should the 
springs show evidence of rust, or 
if they have lost their temper and 
resiliency, new ones are required. 
The best policy is to repair a seat 
at the first indications of sag, 
providing the materials generally are worthy of repair. 
In Fig. 45 is shown a small rocker with webbing and springs 
placed, and springs properly tied. This seat is a reconstruction 
job. Note that the cords are secured inside the rails, and that the 
webbing is tacked underneath the rails excepting on the front rail 
where it is fastened inside. This is necessary because of the curve 
on the bottom of the front rail. It shows the base for a hard-edge 
seat, and is treated in the same manner as the Queen Anne stool 
previously described. The one exception is that the goods are to 
be stretched over the faces of the rails and tacked underneath. 
OLD FURNITURE.—Many heirlooms and other pieces of 
old furniture may be repaired by reglueing and replacing parts, or 
50 
      
FIG. 45 
 
-P-A-G-E-50
RE-UPHOLSTERING 51 
by re-upholstering, and the whole refinished so that it will compare 
favorably with fine pieces of furniture. A piece of furniture of this 
kind is illustrated in Fig. 46. The treatment of the seat is somewhat 
ifferent from that described before. The front edge has a hard 
edge, identical to that described in Chapter VI. The edges at 
  
        
  FIG. 46 FIG. 47 
the sides and back need no sewing; at least, they require very little 
stitching. 
The webbing is tacked on the inner edges of the back, other- 
wise the rabbet would prove too shallow to permit the gimp to 
run flush with the wood surface. The stuffing should be stitched 
to the burlap and webbing. This holds all firmly together. 
To upholster the arms tack twine over the edges, forming loose 
loops into which stuffing may be placed. This twine holds the 
stuffing in place while the muslin is being tacked and the proper 
shape or form given to the arms. Then place the cover over this, 
carefully folding and drawing at the corners. Tack firmly in 
place and attach the gimp.

for making a hard-edge seat are followed on a chair of this kind. 
It requires patience to upholster, but when covered with a good 
piece of tapestry results in a very valuable and comfortable piece 
of furniture. 
In Fig. 48 is illustrated a rocker which shows examples of both 
loose and attached pads on a single structure. The seat is a hard- 
edge loose pad, made in a manner identical to the cricket, but with 
a curved front which increases the difficulty of the work. The arms 
are loose pads held by means of dowels. The back pad is fastened 
to the frame by means of screws, secured before the back part of 
the cover *s attached. With substantial upholstery work this type 
of chair is both serviceable and comfortable. 5

SPRING-EDGE UPHOLSTERY 
} j The two examples of furniture illustrated in Fig. 49 are two 
/ types which are upholstered in a very different manner from any 
of the processes described thus far. This is spring-edge work, and 
is very generally employed on sofas, lounges and settees. In up- 
holsiery of this kind the springs must be placed flush with the out- 
side of the frame. This necessitates bending the springs out some- 
what. 
Fig. 50 shows a chair of this type with webbing attached and 
the method of stitching the springs to the webbing. Note the 
spacing of the webbing. Fig. 51 shows a top view of the same seat. 
Notice that the springs are flush with the outside surface of the 
rail. The spring wire is shown attached and formed. This form 
must be accurately made for it determines the final outline of the 
seat. The wire is fastened near the ends to the upholstery blocks, 
with staples, and to the springs by means of stitching twine coiled 
and tied. There is on the market a certain metal clip for fastening 
the coil and wire together. These clips are attached by means of 
a pair of special pliers. 
Fig. 52 shows the seat in a natural view. Note the method of 
tying the springs. This is different from the method previously 
described. The twine is brought down inside of a spring and tied 
to a second or third coil instead of over the outside top coil. This 
permits the top coil to lie horizontal, and braces the spring so it 
remains vertical. Fig. 51 also illustrates this method. A twine is 
also tacked to the top of the frame and carried up to the spring wire 
and down to the frame again. It is clearly shown in Fig. 52. This 
twine braces the springs and prevents sagging, and results in 
a vertical motion rather than partially horizontal when the seat 
is used. 5

Over this spring work a piece of burlap is then placed and tacked 
with 4-oz. tacks on the top edge of the frame, as illustrated in 
Fig. 53. This burlap must fit tight enough to be smooth, but care 
must be exercised that it does not fit so tight as to result in the pull- 
ing down of the springs. Next place a layer of tow over the burlap. 
Follow with another piece of burlap, and sew onto tKe spring wire

instead of tacking to the frame as in a hard-edge seat. Next form 
the hard edge, and finish off with tow or moss as described pre- 
eviously. 
Fig. 54 shows the various steps in the building up of a seat. 
After the tow has been placed lay on a piece of blue sheet wadding 
or a layer of cotton batting. Lay the cover over this and tack it 
loosely upon the frame and upholstery blocks at the back; stretch 
toward the front and fasten underneath the spring wire with skew-

ers, and secure it in a similar manner at the sides. Then adjust it 
carefully; tack permanently at the back, and then sew just under 
the spring wire. These stitches may be seen at the left in Fig. 54. 
The next step is the placing of the welt edge. This edge is 
clearly shown in Fig. 55. Just below the turn of the top piece a 
eading may be seen. This is the welt edge, and immediately below

is the band. In Fig. 54 is shown a close view of the welt edge. The 
process of making it is as follows: Fold a narrow strip of cloth 
around a soft cord. Hold it against the seat with the edges down; 
turn the band inside out and sew its lower edge. Run the curved 
needle thru it and the welting so that the seam comes immediately 
above the seam which fastens the top cover to the seat. Sew from 
right to left, for then the piece may be handled conveniently with 
the left hand while sewing is done with the right. Three pieces 
are manipulated in this work; the cord, the narrow band of cloth 
folded around the cord, and the front band. This process may be

simplified if a sewing machine is employed. Then the welting cord 
may be sewed into the top edge of the front band. When this is 
sewed to the chair seat but one piece remains to be managed. 
The front band should be draped or folded at the corners. This 
fold may be noticed at the corners of the chair seat in Fig. 55, and 
it allows the band to run about the corner full and smooth. This

is all the more necessary because some stuffing is placed behind the 
band to keep the band from falling in when the edge of the seat 
is pressed down. 
In Fig. 56 is shown the gimp. It is generally fastened with 
gimp tacks, but in very fine work it is glued in place. Glueing has 
a distinct advantage where the gimp must be placed around curves 
for then it may run continuously rather than in a series of straight 
lines between tacks, as is necessary when tacks are employed. 
In Fig. 57 are shown a series of problems in upholstery; in Fig. 
58, the application of such type problems to structures of a dis- 
tinctly useful nature.

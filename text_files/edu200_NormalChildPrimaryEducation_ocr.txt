PREFACE 
This book is the result chiefly of the authors’ contact 
with the eager minds of young women who were preparing 
to teach young children. These prospective teachers wished 
to have definite, workable suggestions in the arts of primary 
pedagogy. The future daily attack of the school program 
with its formidable list of reading, writing, handwork, dra- 
matics, ete., was to them a serious problem. We have tried 
to offer in the core of this book many straightforward, 
practical directions for the normal-school student and the 
teacher, but without the attitude of finality which puts an 
end to all self-help. We believe that one reason why there . 
is not more spirit and originality in the lower elementary 
grades is that the teachers themselves too early suffer a 
subtle arrest in heart and mind elasticity. 
The pedagogical chapters of Part Three aim to present 
constructive suggestions based in large measure on experi- 
ence and experimentation, which included the mistakes and 
efforts of a host of earnest young teachers who had not 
yet been habituated to inflexible programs and methods. 
To these teachers we owe and feel a real debt of gratitude. 
Our indebtedness to The University of Chicago and to 
Clark University will be self-evident. 
Part One is a brief historical introduction which sketches 
a summary of the history of.science with reference to the 
problem of child life, and prepares the reader for the scien- 
tific chapters of Part Two. The latter represent a variety 
of material from the fields of biology and child psychology,

selected and summarized to serve as a foundation and 
background for the pedagogical section. The chapters 
deal with large themes, not so much for the sake of expo- 
sition as with the hope that the schoolroom program and 
practice will be somewhat illuminated and dignified. The 
fundamental subjects of perception and instinct are fully 
treated, and the aim throughout is to develop the genetic 
point of view toward the child and education. 
Part Four considers the child as a whole, with special 
reference to the larger aspects of physical and mental health 
or normality. Special attention is given to the normal men- 
tal hygiene of the child’s personal power and growth. 
What is a normal child? The prevailing standards con- 
sciously or unconsciously adopted in answer to this question 
are sadly slipshod, — even in the pedagogical world where 
high child standards ought to be religiously maintained. 
- It is carelessly assumed that the normal child is the aver- 
age child. 
Teachers of defective children often confess that by a 
gradual process of instinctive toleration or adaptation they 
come to believe that even their inferior pupils are “all 
right,” or at least “ pretty good.” Such teachers resort to 
companionship with “normal” children in order to revive 
their fading standards of what is normal. The great mass 
of elementary school-teachers lapse into a similar under- 
valuation of what is truly normal; but they have no con- 
venient place of reference where they can rectify their 
slumping standards. 
We must go to science, to literature, to art, to revitalize 
our ideals of childhood. We ought to see more children in 
half-naked garb, as the Greeks did, — bare arms, legs, chests, 
—-to give us a feeling for the beauty and nobility of the 
human form. We are becoming too satisfied with the collars

and ribbons of our primary pupils, and not keeping alive 
our natural disapproval of the frail, unshapely bodies which 
clothes conceal. Likewise we are losing a sense of what is 
mentally normal. 
The sciences of education have not, however, worked 
out a detailed psychophysical portrait of the normal child, 
and at present we have more adequate pictures of types 
of subnormality than we have of normality. A particular 
interest in the pronounced and pathological deviations from 
the medium has been to the detriment of the great medium 
mass of children, who, after all, are the most important, for 
the democratic reason that God made so many of them. 
There are over seventeen millions of pupils, the majority 
under ten years of age, enrolled in the public schools of 
our country. A small fraction are in special classes for the 
backward and defective. The rest are all “normal.” 
By reason of the vast amount and by reason of the pecul- 
iar potentiality of all this child life in the early grades, the 
primary teachers, who far out-iumber any other class of 
teachers, have a big part to play in the expanding move- 
ment for the conservation of national vitality. By bring- 
ing new health, gladness, and creativeness into the pri- 
mary school, a large and precious measure of perishable 
elements in human material can be saved to the race. 
Part Four treats some possibilities in a new-old field of 
conservation. 
The work in this fine field can be furthered, we believe, 
if those who have to do with children will develop and 
heroically maintain high standards of normal childhood in 
its various ages. This book may in some places do some- 
thing to make more definite and elevated ‘such standards 
of what is normal. We have not written for the techni- 
cal clinician, but for the elementary school-teacher, and, 
   
-P-A-G-E-8
    viii PREFACE 
of course, for other traditional guardians of children, as 
mothers, aunts, some fathers, supervisors, and child-study 
and reading circles. 
It is preferable that the normal should approximate the 
ideal rather than the average. The higher and stronger the 
norm of normality the better for the race. The Greeks used 
the word “ idea” to mean the model which existing objects 
imperfectly embody. Millions of the primary children in our 
“regular” grades imperfectly embody what is ideal, what 
is normal. We have not ventured far into the dangerous 
and uncertain problem of primary prodigies and precocity. 
According to certain new ideas of child: culture, ordinary 
children by proper nursery pedagogy may be brought at 
primary age to high-school levels of intellectual advance- 
ment. Although there is nothing finally established as to 
. the ultimate healthy limits of achievement in the primary 
child, we do believe that he is at present far below his pos- 
sibilities, and think it regrettable that the primary schools 
continue to turn out such hordes of pupils subnormal in 
personal power. The primary child has many untouched 
reservoirs of interest and capacity. He is ripe for unguessed 
avenues of activity and attainment. Though we need not 
suddenly strive to make of him a prodigy, we can hold him 
more completely to what is soundly normal.

HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 
CHAPTER I 
HUMANITARIANISM AND THE CHILD 
The child has been called the last serf of civilization. 
Two sister influences have come to his emancipation, hu- 
manitarianism and science. A humanitarian attitude toward 
children would seem to be the most natural thing in the 
world. Even among the lower animals we find the instinct 
of parental sympathy, the root of all tenderness. But his- 
tory shows in many pages how both instinct and reason 
‘have failed to develop an adequate regard for the child. 
It was written in the sacred books of the Hebrews that 
the disobedient son should be stoned by the tribe with 
stones till he die. This severity belongs to the Old Testa- 
ment régime. Some of the loftiest conceptions of childhood 
were to appear in the New Testament. Strangely enough, 
however, some of the most terrible misconceptions concern- 
ing childhood developed with the Christian Church. From 
St. Augustine to Jonathan Edwards, the doctrine of child 
depravity was proclaimed and practiced. It was enunciated’ 
and reénunciated by the early fathers, the Lutherans, the 
Council of the Reformation, the Calvinists, and the Puri- 
tans. For overa millennium this gloomy declaration, now so 
abhorrent to our humanity, was a mere truism. It must be 
3
-P-A-G-E-14
  4 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 
interpreted with due tolerance by the present generation, 
but it cannot be brushed aside as a mere theological theory. 
Theory colors practice, and this idea that children, “by their 
carnal conception and nativity, came into this world steeped 
in sin and guilt, the heirs of hell,” inevitably introduced 
many forms of insidious cruelty into home and school. The 
puritanical spirit of abnormal sternness and repression, which 
interpreted simple childish mischievousness as the work of 
Satan, was directly descended from this honest belief in the 
utter depravity of human nature. 
The best measure of the civilization of any people is the 
degree of thoughtful reverence paid to the child. The close 
of the eighteenth century, which brought forth ideas of lib- 
erty and emancipation on such a grand scale, is therefore 
well called the age of enlightenment. The roll call of that 
great epoch of Aufklirung included the names of Schiller, 
Goethe, Kant, Payne, Washington, Wilberforce, Jefferson, 
Fichte, Grimm, Wordsworth, Kosciusko, Bach, Voltaire, 
Herder, Schleiermacher, Rousseau, —a great medley, but 
proof that powerful liberalizing and humanizing forces were 
penetrating all departments of life. Elementary education 
in the fullness of time was to be transformed by this Aufkli- 
rung. The eternal worth of individuality was rising to a 
new recognition. “In a certain sense,” says Natorp, “all 
threads run together in the one idea of education for human- 
ity. At last man was anxious to understand the human in 
humanity, in ‘order to develop the human in humanity.” 
One great name which must be added to the above roll 
call is that of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi. This picturesque 
but powerful man was moved by the new enthusiasm for 
humanity. He believed that children, above all else, should 
be understood and loved; that in them lay the regeneration 
of the world. So he converted his home into a combined 2
-P-A-G-E-15
  HUMANITARIANISM AND THE CHILD 5 
primary school and social settlement, and set the world a 
novel example of kindness for which it was becoming more 
and more ready. 
In Pestalozzi’s old age there came into existence a form 
of harshness to children which in many respects dwarfed 
that of any previous age, —the child labor of the Indus- 
trial Revolution. In England, the mighty land of looms, the 
trafficking in and enslavement of children became a veri- 
table system, and the suffering and degeneration which fell 
upon thousands of defenseless creatures, toiling for four- 
teen and sixteen hours a day at the remorseless machines, 
are unspeakable. ‘Southey exclaimed, “ Death in the brazen 
arms of a Carthaginian idol was mercy to the slow waste 
of life in the factories.” 
The liberation of children from industrial oppression is not 
yet complete. The resistance of the English mill owners, 
and even of parents and Parliament, —including such states- 
men as Brougham, Bright, Cobden, Russell, and Gladstone, 
—to the amelioration of these child laborers is a matter of 
history. The noble work of the Earl of Shaftesbury in the 
face of this resistance is also history. He compelled the 
nation not to work its children more than twelve hours a 
day ; he rescued the little chimney sweep from the danger 
of fire and death; he covered all London with ragged 
schools, and asylums for the homeless, and released a whole 
army of working boys and girls from factory, forge, and 
mine. Even thus, before dying, in 1885, he lamented: “I 
cannot bear to leave the world with all the misery in it.” 
England produced another great humanitarian in the per- 
son of Charles Dickens. His influence in creating a greater 
tenderness and respect for childhood in his own country, on 
the Continent, and in America, can hardly be overestimated. 
He was a contemporary of, Lord Shaftesbury. These were
-P-A-G-E-16
6 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 
the days when a man could mercilessly beat his wife, his 
beast, and his child, without a challenge; when orphans, 
idiots, and strays were herded into bleak workhouses, and 
when schools were “nurseries of vice,” commonly presided 
over by “incapable pettifoggers or sordid, brutal men to 
  Fig. 1. Squrrers 
(From an old print) 
whom few considerate persons would have intrusted a 
dog.” Oliver Twist, Dotheboys Hall, Squeers, Nicholas 
Nickleby, Child Queller, and Choakumchild are names that 
bring a flood of associations true to actual conditions. “The 
pale and haggard faces, lank and bony figures, children 
with the countenances of old men,” that stalk through
-P-A-G-E-17
HUMANITARIANISM AND THE CHILD i 
Dickens’s stories, were not merely the product of artistic 
imagination; nor were the schools “where every kindly 
sympathy and affection was blasted in its birth and every 
young and healthy feeling flogged and starved down.” The 
real truth is that the doctrine of child depravity still lin- 
gered as a dominant Christian ideal. Repression and cor- 
poral punishment were the rules. The greater mildness in 
methods of training and the very existence of many child- 
welfare organizations to-day are traceable to that eloquent 
champion of children’s rights, — Charles Dickens. 
At the centennial year of Dickens’s birth it is interesting 
to recall such large expressions of the humanitarian attitude 
toward children as the Child Welfare Exhibit, held first at 
New York and recently, on a bigger scale, in Chicago. Hun- 
dreds of thousands of people in each city visited this unique 
exposition, with its army of “ explainers” and its wealth of 
photographs, statistics, headline statements, and living dem- 
onstrations setting forth the conditions of city child life. 
Nothing could. have been more significant of the greater 
solicitude for children, with which we associate the name of 
Dickens, than these remarkable and inspiring exhibits. 
Humanitarianism is becoming part of the spirit of the 
race. One has but to glance through the directory of the 
charities of a large city to be convinced of this. While 
societies for the prevention of cruelty to children are still 
a necessity, deliberate and brutal forms of cruelty belong 
more to the past than to the present; but the unwitting 
cruelty of indifference and ignorance was perhaps never 
so extensive asight now. This, Science alone can dispel, 
by the enlightenment of the masses and by the cultivation 
of experts.
-P-A-G-E-18
CHAPTER II 
THE SCIENTIFIC INTERPRETATION OF LIFE 
The fuller appreciation of childhood to-day has by no 
means been due to the growth of the humanitarian spirit 
alone. The other great factor has been the development of 
modern science. The present splendid, growing body of 
scientific knowledge about life represents the most impor- 
tant achievement of the race. 
With the end of the classic civilization, science, broadly 
speaking, came to a standstill and remained so for centuries. 
This is particularly true of the sciences concerned with the 
body and the mind of man, and therefore of the child. 
There was no scientific interpretation of life. All discus- 
sions on this vital central theme were carried on by the 
fruitless method of scholastic philosophy, and were never 
based. on first-hand inquiry. Such inquiry into facts over 
which God had, it was said, purposely placed a mantle of 
mystery, was frowned upon as being unpious and prying 
curiosity. The medicine, physiology, and psychology of 
the medieval period, therefore, were a mixture of»error and 
fancy, except where the authorities whom the scholars were 
constantly quoting happened to be right. 
Chief among these authorities were Galen and Aristotle, 
exponents of a former scientific culture. Even Aristotle, the 
greatest of the Greek intellects, was not always a safe guide. 
He thought that the soul pervaded the whole body, and had 
no idea of the nature and use of the nervous system, believ- 
ing that the brain was a refrigerating apparatus to cool the 
8
-P-A-G-E-19
  
THE SCIENTIFIC INTERPRETATION OF LIFE 9 
passions that arose in the heart. Galen thought that the 
blood, by an oscillatory motion, reached the brain, where it 
was elaborated into animal spirits, which were conveyed by 
tubular nerves throughout the body to impart motion, etc. 
This belief in humors, spirits, and sympathies persisted as 
a source of confusion down into the nineteenth century. 
Burton, in his quaint work “ The Anatomy of Melancholy,” 
calls spirit “a most subtle vapor which is expressed from 
the blood, and the instrument of the soul to perform all 
his actions.” A few other sample views follow: The optic 
nerve is a tube through which visual spirits pass, carrying 
ideas from the air and édola from objects to the brain; the 
liver is the seat of love, and the spleen of wit; the brain in- 
creases and decreases with the phases of the moon ; sensation 
and motion are in the first ventricle, imagination and cogita- 
tion in the third ventricle. 
Medicine, which like pedagogy depends upon a solid 
foundation of science, was discouraged. Drugs and sanita- 
tion were actually opposed. Because sickness was thought 
to be due to evil spirits, healing was performed by miracles, 
fetishes, charms, relics, amulets, potions, exorcisms, royal 
touch, and by tortura insomniae. Hundreds of thousands of 
men, women, and children were tortured for being the instru- 
ments of Satan. We are now certain that they were not 
under the influence of witches or Satanic imps, but simply 
suffering from diseases of the nervous system. But with a 
systematized resistance to the investigation of the nervous 
system, Nature snugly concealed her facts and laws from 
the eyes of sinful man. The most elementary facts about 
the child as a psychophysical mechanism simply were not 
understood or were misunderstood. Theological conceptions 
such as the doctrine. of child depravity took the place of 
scientific interpretation. Man did not even know how many
-P-A-G-E-20
10 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 
ribs he had, because theological interpretation was preferred 
to the testimony of eye and hand. 
/ With the age of geographical discovery was ushered in 
Ya spirit of scientific discovery. Both partake of a similar 
impulse, — man’s adventurous daring to penetrate the 
unknown. 
One of the greatest of the pioneers of discovery was the 
impetuous, forceful Belgian, Vesalius, the father of modern 
anatomy. In the face of conservatism, prejudice, and actual 
persecution, he abandoned the venerable charts of Galen and 
went straight to the facts of nature. 
The original of the accompanying portrait of Vesalius, now 
in Cornell University, is eloquently described by Andrew 
D. White in his “History of the Warfare of Science with 
Theology”: “By the magic of Hamann’s pencil Vesalius 
again stands on earth, and we look once more into his cell. 
Its windows and doors, bolted and barred within, betoken 
the storm of bigotry which rages without; the crucifix, 
toward which he turns his eyes, symbolizes the spirit in 
which he labors; the corpse of the plague stricken beneath 
his hand ceases to be repulsive ; his very soul seems to send 
forth rays from the canvas, which strengthen us for the good 
fight in this age.” 
Dissection of the body had for centuries been frowned 
upon as impious, but Vesalius “ haunted gibbets and charnel 
houses” so that he might secure material for his classic work 
“De corporis humani fabrica.” This great, “sincere book,” 
beautifully illustrated with accurate drawings, laid the 
foundation of modern biological science. Locy says, “It is 
more than a landmark in the progress of science ; it created 
an epoch.” In the spirit of modern science he performed ex- 
periments on living structures to determine their function. 
This method of experimental. observation, which Harvey 
 
-P-A-G-E-21

-P-A-G-E-22
12 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 
introduced in the study of the living body, has never ceased 
to this day. It has been most fruitful in deepening our 
insight into life. With Harvey it resulted in that most 
fundamental truth, the circulation of the blood. 
A century after Harvey, Albrecht Haller, the learned 
Swiss, made his observations which overthrew the old doc- 
trine of animal spirits. He established the independent irri- 
tability of muscle and nerve tissue, and thus paved the way 
for a scientific interpretation of reflex action. He gathered 
the chief facts and theories of his time into a volume of 
vast learning, and may be considered with Harvey one of 
the founders of modern physiology. 
The nervous system soon came to be recognized as the 
supreme organ of the body, and conceptions in respect to it 
took shape. Sir Charles Bell, in 1811, distinguished the 
motor and sensory branches of the spinal nerves, which led 
to the modern theory of reflex action. This theory explains 
reflexes on a mechanical basis, tracing an impulse over a 
physical highway to its culmination, without calling in the 
assistance of a semitelepathic sympathy. The old notion 
which made the brain a gland, a distillery for subtle vapors, 
similarly had to give way for the illuminating facts about 
cerebral localization. In 1860 the great French surgeon 
Broca discovered the particular area in the brain which 
controls articulate speech. This brilliant discovery was fol- 
lowed by others which have to a marvelous degree explained 
the nature and functions of the human cerebral cortex. 
There are two branches to the study of anatomy. One, 
gross anatomy, investigates the larger conformations and 
relationships of the structures; the other is minute anat- 
omy. When the compound microscope was invented, at the 
close of the sixteenth century, the observation of nature 
was raised to a higher power. The early microscopes were
-P-A-G-E-23
THE SCIENTIFIC INTERPRETATION OF LIFE 13 
erude and clumsy affairs compared with the beautiful in- 
struments of to-day, but the revelations which they brought 
forth fascinated the pioneer microscopists so that they sacri- 
ficed their eyes and gave their lives to an exploration of 
the minute. Grew of England studied the fine structure of 
plants and vegetables; Malpighi of Italy wrote on glands 
and capillaries and the anatomy of the silkworm; Swam- 
merdam produced a marvelous treatise on the honeybee ; 
Leeuwenhoek distinguished himself by his discovery of 
microscopic animal forms, which he called animalcula. 
Locy quotes a paragraph which gives us an interesting 
glimpse into the work of Swammerdam: “ His daily labors 
began at six in the morning, when the sun afforded him 
light enough to enable him to survey such minute objects, 
and from that time until twelve he continued without in- 
terruption, all the while exposed in the open air to the 
scorching heat of the sun, bareheaded, for fear of interrupt- 
ing the light, and his head in a manner dissolving into sweat 
under the irresistible ardor of that powerful luminary.” At 
night he was almost as constantly engaged in recording his 
observations by drawings and suitable explanations. 
The protozoa, ever since their discovery by Leeuwen- 
hoek, have been studied with great energy and ingenuity. 
In them the phenomena of life and behavior are reduced to 
elementary terms, which offer much suggestion for physi- 
ology and psychology. Especially notable in this field are 
the labors of Verworn, O. Fr. Miiller, Ehrenberg, Metch 
nikoff, Jennings, and Loeb. 
Bacteria are microérganisms allied to the protozoa. They 
belong to the world of the infinitely small, and could not 
be studied with effect until the perfection of the com- 
pound microscope in the nineteenth century. The germ 
theory of disease, which had been suggested a generation
-P-A-G-E-24
  14 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 
earlier, was experimentally proved by Pasteur and Koch 
in 1877. Bacteriology is now an important department of 
biology, and the brilliant researches in this field have con- 
tributed their valuable share to the protection and compre- 
hension of child life in health and disease. : 
No science has contributed quite so much to an under- 
standing of the mechanics of behavior as has the science of 
histology. This science carries anatomical analysis to its 
minutest elements, inquiring into the organization of the 
tissues themselves. The historian tells us that the name 
of the brilliant young Frenchman Bichat must be ranked 
with that of Vesalius, because he initiated these profound, 
far-reaching structural investigations. The modern cell 
theory, which was established by Schwann, Schleiden, and 
a long line of other laborers, was the first great generaliza- 
tion resulting from histological study. This theory, which 
we so freely imbibe and which nowadays is taught to 
primary children, was not announced until 1838. Twenty- 
three years later Schultze established that other epoch- 
making generalization, the doctrine of protoplasm. These 
two grand conceptions are among the most far-reaching 
achievements of modern science. ) They unify and identify 
in a fundamental way the structures of plants and of ani- 
mals, reducing them to elementary globules of protoplasm, 
living cells. Protoplasm is the physical basis oflife, which 
links the child with all organisms, even the lowest. . Biology 
is the science of life. It is no wonder that Max Schultze 
should sometimes be called the father of modern biology. 
The, histologists the world over are still busy describ- 
ing, drawing, and photographing the myriad cells, in health 
and disease, which make up our bodies and those of plants 
and animals. They have even estimated the total number 
of cells in the human body. These cells are not the same 
 
-P-A-G-E-25
THE SCIENTIFIC INTERPRETATION OF LIFE 15 
in size, shape, or importance. If we arrange them in a 
hierarchy, the nerve cells — some eleven billion in number 
—must be considered the most aristocratic, for it is they 
which initiate and control all our behavior, in its parts and 
in its organized wholes, from the winking of an eye to the 
writing of a speech, — our conscious and our unconscious 
behavior, from the peristalsis of our intestines to the fram- 
ing of a philosophical system. It is these nerve cells which 
we must understand if we would know the laws behind 
that most subtle and delicate piece of machinery, the child. 
The science of neurology, which has for its subject the 
nerve cells, has furnished invaluable interpretations for 
psychology and education. 
It would be incorrect to think that neurological investi- 
gation depends chiefly upon the patient use of the micro- 
scope. Nature does not so readily yield her secrets. In the 
case of nerve tissue the high-power microscope alone often 
only magnifies her refusal to yield. It took the united 
cunning of a generation of students, the world over, to 
devise a strategy which compelled nature to reveal the 
internal architecture of the nervous system. This strategy 
is represented in the elaborate technical methods of pre- 
paring tissue for study, contained in the huge manuals of 
the art of microscopy. Before tissue is ready for examina- 
tion it must be fixed in alcohol, hardened and preserved, 
  embedded in paraffin, cut into delicate sections by the 
microtome, stained by various dyes, and mounted between 
‘glass. All the great biological and medical laboratories now 
contain hundreds of these microscopic preparations, speci- 
mens from the deepest layers yet penetrated in nature’s 
fathomless mine. 
Nowhere are the persistence and the patience, the co- 
operative and cosmopolitan spirit of modern science more

CHAPTER IT 
THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THE CHILD 
After all has been said, the most profoundly revolu- 
tionary and productive event in the history of biological 
thought was the publication, in 1859, of Darwin’s “ Origin 
of Species.” Everything in nature has a pedigree, a history. 
An organism is really not understood even when anatomy, 
physiology, and histology combine to explain its structure 
and mechanism in minute detail. There always remains 
the great historical question of origin and development. 
This was Darwin’s problem, and to its solution he conse- 
crated his genius. As early as 1835, on his voyage around 
the world as naturalist on his Majesty’s ship the Beagle, 
the problem occurred to him. In his famous letter to the 
botanist Hooker he says: “I was so struck with the dis- 
tribution of the Galapagos organisms and with the char- 
acter of the American fossil mammifers that I determined 
to collect blindly every sort of fact which would bear in 
any way on what are species. I have read heaps of agri- 
cultural and horticultural books and have never ceased. 
collecting facts.” 
The origin and development of species is a venerable 
problem. Aristotle spoke of a principle of perfection run- 
ning through the universe. The medieval scholars naturally 
accepted the Hebrew account of the genesis of all things 
and the preservation of species in Noah’s ark. In fact, 
the belief in the immutability and special creation of species 
persisted into the nineteenth century. Linnzeus, the great 
17

    18 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 
naturalist whose system of nomenclature did so much 
to bring order and classification into the accumulating 
knowledge about plants and animals, believed all species 
were created in the beginning. He was acquainted with 
only four thousand species of animals, whereas it is now 
known that the species, extinct and living, must easily 
number a million. As the fossil remains of extinct crea- 
tures came to be better known, the idea of the fixity of 
species became more and more untenable. Buffon, Erasmus 
Darwin, and Goethe all doubted such fixity. Cuvier, to 
defend the prevailing concept, presented the theory of 
cataclysms, which asserted that there were successive eras 
of destruction and creation, and fossils were the remnants 
of these ancient cataclysms. Lamarck held that these fossils 
represented the ancestors of living forms. He worked out 
a comprehensive theory of descent and mutability of species 
which entitles him to be called the father of evolutionary 
thought; but he was neither happy nor fruitful in sug- 
gesting the way in which species originate and are trans- 
formed. Charles Darwin, after twenty-five years of quiet, 
patient study, presented an explanation of the way in his 
epoch-making book. 
His explanation was the principle of natural selection, 
which Romanes calls the most important idea ever con- 
ceived by man. This principle, like a telescope, freed man 
from the narrow horizon of the present and the recent, 
and allowed him to glimpse down the deep perspective of 
the geologic past. It gave him some conception of how 
all the manifold earthly flora and fauna came to be what 
they are. Not only in the special fields of zodlogy and 
botany did it extend the vision, but in every department 
of thought the interpretations of men were given a new 
range and depth.

20 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 
Thus sociology, anthropology, politics, and even theology 
reshaped their subject matter along the new genetic lines. 
Embryology became less purely anatomical — became almost 
“romantically historical” under the new Darwinian influ- 
ence. Through the labor of Fritz Miiller, Balfour, Mar- 
shall, and Haeckel, one of the most wonderful of all 
scientific generalizations was worked out, — the theory of 
recapitulation, which holds that animals, in their individ- 
ual unfoldment, to a considerable degree recapitulate the 
phases of their phyletic or racial development. 
So extensively was the intelligence of the age affected 
that the nineteenth century has even been called Darwin’s 
century. “Whatever the verdict of posterity,” — quoting 
from Huxley, the ardent champion of Darwinism, — “ the 
broad fact remains that since the publication, and by reason 
of the publication, of the ‘Origin of Species,’ the funda- 
mental concepts and aims of the students of living nature 
have been completely changed.” 
The child is a part of living nature. The greatest modern 
student of the child is G. Stanley Hall. When the history 
of science is seriously recorded, his name will be linked with 
that of Charles Darwin. Both are large-visioned interpreters 
of nature, combining scientific methods with a philosophic 
temper. Darwin applied his genius to the great genetic 
problems of biology; Hall is the Darwin of psychology. 
Both have gleaned the fields of paleontology, geology, an- 
thropology, botany, and zodlogy, to set forth illuminating 
interpretations concerning the development and expression 
of life. In many fields their studies overlap. Indeed, the 
psychology of Hall is biological; he has brought these two 
sciences into intimate and fruitful union. Darwin could 
limit himself, rather strictly, to measurable, verifiable data, 
in his studies of the plant and animal kingdom; Hall’s 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
  THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THE CHILD 21 
labors lie in the much less tangible kingdom of soul, and 
in this difficult, submerged field he has manifested intuition 
and suggestiveness characteristic of genius. He has collected 
his data from every possible source, — from biography, and 
great quantities of confessions and questionnaire returns ; 
from prisons, insane wards, medicine, superstition, myths, 
folklore, —all for the purpose of restoring to our appre- 
ciation the extinct phases of the life of the soul. For he 
believes that our present consciousness is but a species, a 
stage in evolution; that its history began with the origin 
of organic life, if indeed not earlier, and that it inherits 
as instincts, latencies, rudiments, recapitulatory nascen- 
cies, or unconscious impulses, the prehuman features of 
its development. 
G. Stanley Hall is at once the foremost leader of genetic 
psychology and of the child-study movement. No one has 
so clearly and consistently held that the child is a worthy 
center of unity for a new synthesis of all the knowledge 
bearing on physical and mental development. He has not 
stood aloof from the popular and practical phases of such 
‘a movement, but has encouraged a harmony of psychology 
and pedagogy, of science and all sociological endeavor 
which concerns the child. 
Such a specific and focalized interest in the child is of 
very recent date. In 1775 Pestalozzi began his quaint diary 
of a father, which contains random observations and a few 
naive experiments on his son Jacobli. The entries are often 
emotional and prayerful, and yet they contain a vein of 
empiricism which links them to the later systematic studies 
of children. In 1787 Tiedemann wrote his “ Observations 
on the Development of the Minds of Children.” 
In 1826 appeared Froebel’s wonderful book “ The Educa- 
tion of Man.” Miss Shinn, herself the author of an important 
 
-P-A-G-E-32
  22 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 
work on the mental development of the child, has half 
humorously suggested that Froebel’s works are like the 
Koran, and that our subsequent child study is like the 
Alexandrian Library: “If child study agrees with Froebel, 
it is of no use, burn it; if it does not, it deserves only to 
be burned.” Froebel undoubtedly ranks among the deepest 
interpreters of childhood. He appreciated the value of play, 
and his writings are pervaded with the concepts of growth 
and development. But these concepts were derived from 
a half mystical, philosophical view ; they are prophetic and 
intuitive rather than biological. Darwinism had not yet 
come. Froebel’s theories present a curious admixture of 
the logical and the genetic points of view, and in the light 
of present knowledge they need correction at many places. 
Much of the meaning that lies only vaguely hidden in 
Froebel has been made explicit by recent child study, so it 
would not be wise to burn the latter. i 
It is very significant that Darwin should have written a 
diary on the development of his infant son. This diary 
consists of scientific observations strikingly different from 
Pestalozzi’s pious notes. It is the natural forerunner of the 
modern studies of children which began with Preyer in 
Germany and with G. Stanley Hall in America. 
The “Study of the Contents of Children’s Minds on 
entering School,” by Hall, is the first landmark in the 
child study of this country. This interesting census revealed 
a most wonderful amount of error and ignorance in the 
primary child’s information, and showed the practical use- 
fulness as well as scientific interest of inquiry into his 
characteristics. 
We can only make a compressed summary of the sub- 
sequent development of child study. G. Stanley Hall, with 
an enthusiastic group of coworkers and students at Clark
-P-A-G-E-33
  THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THE CHILD 23 
University, has been the chief leader of this development. 
He founded the Pedagogical Seminary and the American 
Journal of Psychology for the publication of child-study 
investigations.. His monumental work “Adolescence” ranks 
as the most important contribution to child-study literature. 
This work embodies an incredible amount of study in the 
varied fields of physiology, anthropology, sociology, sex, 
crime, religion, and education, and furnishes new insight 
into a most baffling and vital problem. Hall has just com- 
pleted an equally monumental work entitled “ Educational 
Problems.” Besides a large number of minor books and 
the studies in the Psychological Review and other journals, 
J. Mark Baldwin’s two volumes entitled “ Mental Develop- 
ment in the Child and the Race” may be mentioned as one 
of the most ambitious efforts to generalize in the new field 
of genetic psychology. 
Child study as an organized movement took shape at the 
International Congress of Education, at the World’s Colum- 
bian Exposition, with the founding of a national society 
for the study of children. In the same year the British 
Association for Child Study, which has ever since had a 
prosperous career, was founded. Organizations sprang up 
in many states all over the Union; especially active was 
the society in Illinois. The activity and enthusiasm of these 
many organizations, though destined to wane after the first 
outburst, were proof that the new theories about children 
were gaining footing. These societies have done great 
propagandic and educative service, and the unnumbered 
child-study circles, in large cities and small, to this day are 
assisting in bringing to a wider realization, both in thought 
and in practice, modern ideas of education. 
One of the most important of the organizations which have 
sprung up in connection with the child-study movement is
-P-A-G-E-34
24 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 
the National Playground Association. The playground 
movement illustrates the unique character and spirit of 
the child-study movement as a whole, —a focalization of 
thought upon the nature and needs of the child; a union 
in understanding and helpfulness of experts, laymen, aca- 
demic investigators, and practical workers. Our, present 
appreciation of play has largely had its source in the bio- 
logical studies of instincts. These studies received their 
main impetus from Darwin’s suggestive labors. Lloyd Mor- 
gan’s investigations of animal instincts, Groos’s two impor- 
tant books on the “Play of Animals” and the “Play of 
Man,” Johnson’s and Gulick’s studies of play interests, 
and Hall’s writings furnished the scientific sanction for the 
renaissance of play. Educators, social workers, and citizens 
are uniting to put these scientific findings to use. Similar 
things are happening in every department of education and 
social effort, —in school hygiene, in the revival of the 
dance, in juvenile crime, in children’s amusements, ete. 
Child study primarily, however, is a science, or an induc- 
tive synthesis of all the sciences dealing in any way with 
the nature of childhood. Of fundamental importance are 
the special and accurate investigations of the laboratory. 
The first laboratory in experimental psychology was estab- 
lished by Wilhelm Wundt in 1878. Since then such lab- 
oratories have sprung up the civilized world over, and 
systematic researches on children, their processes of learn- 
ing, judging, remembering, etc., have furnished important 
contributions to child study. Two notable works have ap- 
peared in Germany on the subject of experimental pedagogy, 
—one by Wilhelm Lay, the other by Meumann, a student 
of Wundt. Lay has also established a magazine entitled 
Die experimentelle Pddagogik. This new field represents an 
application of the mathematical and instrumental methods  
-P-A-G-E-35
THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THE CHILD 25 
of experimental psychology to the problems of pedagogy. 
In Antwerp the municipality has founded a pedagogical 
laboratory. 
The new courses appearing in our universities and the 
character of the recently founded Journal of Educational 
Psychology indicate the growth of experimental pedagogy 
in America. Dr. H. H. Goddard is conducting a research 
laboratory in connection with the Vineland, New Jersey, 
School for the Feeble-minded, which will further the solu- 
tion of Binet’s problem of ‘devising satisfactory tests for 
the mental diagnosis of defective and dull children, and 
will throw light on their education. Similar research sta- 
tions have been established in connection with institutions 
for the feeble-minded at Lincoln, Illinois, and Faribault, 
Minnesota. 
Through the inspiration and leadership of Colonel Fran- 
cis Parker and Dr. John Dewey, the Elementary School 
of The University of Chicago has been a semi-experimental 
center for the development of original pedagogical ideas 
which have leavened our public-school system. Columbia 
University with its Teachers College, and the Horace Mann 
and Speyer schools, have produced many studies in the field 
of education. Especially notable is Professor Thorndike’s 
application of refined statistical methods to the measure- 
ment of mental capacity and development. Dr. Lightner 
Witmer, in Philadelphia, has started a unique work in the 
study of backward children. He conducts a psychological 
clinic, and issues a monthly journal devoted especially to the 
study and treatment of retardation and deviation. Signifi. 
cant also is the recent appearance of Dr. G. M. Whipple’s 
“Manual of Mental and Physical Tests,” —“‘a book of direc- 
tions compiled with special reference to the experimental 
study of school children in the laboratory or classroom.”
-P-A-G-E-36
  26 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION 
Some day, probably, laboratories of child study and edu- 
cational hygiene will be a regular feature of every large 
public-school system in America. Indeed, the school board 
of Chicago has, since 1899, maintained an official Depart- 
ment of Child Study and Pedagogic Investigation, under 
the direction of Drs. Christopher, Smedley, Bruner, and 
Macmillan. New York City and the Russell Sage Founda- 
tion have each created a Department of Child Hygiene. 
Medical inspection of schools. has extended into hundreds 
of American cities. 
All these facts declare the trend toward a more univer- 
sal diagnosis of the health and educational needs of indi- 
vidual children. This is the logical outcome of the scientific 
study of the child. It is the natural outcome of the scientific 
interpretation of life. Such interpretation reveals the laws 
of life and develops a new conscience toward these laws. 
The end-result will be a revolution of the work of the 
schools, because the traditions and inherited organization 
of the schools contain no true conscience as to health. 
The traditional mission of the schools has been the trans- 
mission of culture, the imparting of skill and information. 
The new biological temper, which is the product of modern 
science, exalts hygiene and makes health the central solici- 
tude in all the work of education. How recent is this new 
attitude of the school is brought home to us by Dr. Ayres: 
“Eleven years ago the school superintendents of America, 
assembled in convention in Chicago, discussed the problems 
then foremost in educational thought and action. Diligent 
search through the printed report of that meeting disclosed 
no single mention of child health, no word about school 
hygiene, no address devoted to the conservation or devel- 
‘opment of the physical vigor of youth. “At that time eight 
cities in America had systems of medical inspection in their
-P-A-G-E-37
  
THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF THE CHILD 27 
public schools. To-day the number of such systems is over 
four hundred. This development is without parallel in the 
history of education.” 
The new changes in education have been directed chiefly 
toward the care of backward, defective, and delinquent 
children, but incidentally the normal child is being bene- 
fited in untold ways. And he will reap the large benefit in 
the future. The new biological temper in education is also 
normalizing and training our humanitarianism. Through 
science, humanitarianism is losing some of its sentimental 
tears and romantic miscarriages, and changing into a more 
robust attitude of justice and protection, — protection of 
the health and vigor of normal children. Historically, Child 
Hygiene, yesterday only a phrase, but already becoming 
a program for action, is a phase or an outgrowth of the 
scientific study of the child. 
The child-study movement has grown to be so complex 
that a notable effort was recently made to bring its many 
phases into closer relationship. In July, 1909, there was 
held at Clark University a series of conferences which, in 
the light of the history we have sketched from prescientific 
times to the present, takes on considerable interest and 
significance. At these conferences were gathered leading 
representatives of the following interests: day nurseries, 
kindergartens, child psychology, medical education of de- 
fectives and subnormal children, open-air schools, tubercu- 
losis in children, eugenic movements, psychological clinics, 
school nurses and physicians, settlement work for children, 
boys’ clubs, Sunday school, industrial training, child labor, 
story-telling league, children’s theater, playground move- 
ment, children’s libraries, dancing and music, the juvenile 
court. It was a general child-welfare congress. A chil- 
dren’s institute was founded, which will be a repository for

information and a disseminating center of service, correlat- 
ing the scientific studies of children with practical methods 
for advancing their physical, mental, and moral well-being. 
Experts and practical laymen, psychologists and_ social 
workers, were all present to learn from each other and to 
help each other. They gathered with a focal interest in 
the child. It was a blending of the two great forces which 
have been accumulating volume down the centuries and 
are now coming consciously to the rescue of the child, — 
Humanitarianism and Science.

THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
CHAPTER IV 
THE BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE 
The child is situated between two vistas, one of which 
reaches into the remote past, the other into the pregnant 
future. Sometimes teachers are not conscious of either vista, 
and this is shortness of sight. It takes a combined seer and 
prophet to see clearly in both directions, and the teacher 
should be as much of each as possible. The reason why so 
much of the school’s activity is petty, or seems petty, is 
because the teachers are themselves petty-visioned. The 
present in the individual, in the race, and in society is but 
a stage of evolution, which can be understood only in terms 
of the past. The child is not a static thing which mere logic, 
however sharp, can by analysis dissect and thus explain. 
Childhood is all recapitulation, nascency, and growth. The 
child has a pedigree, both human and biological, and to 
appreciate him -we must think historically. 
This means that we must unclamp the chronological 
imagination and give it freedom to roam back even beyond 
the days of Moses and the Pharaohs. Our forefathers were 
very parsimonious with their chronology, and a Cambridge 
University scholar in the seventeenth century, after an 
exhaustive study, specifically limited the imagination to 
29

30 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
4004 B.c., October 23, 9 A.M. (the pedagogue is apt to 
think, perhaps, that everything worth while begins at about 
9 A.M.). But this is the age of evolution, when a millen- 
nium in nature’s history is considered but the winking of 
an eye. 2 
Haeckel, by an ingenious condensation, makes the vastness 
of geological epochs comprehensible. Allowing one hundred 
million years for the age of life on our globe, and calling this 
immense period a solar day, the span of time since Moses 
becomes less than five seconds. G. Stanley Hall, in a recent 
articlé, has argued that it is “more scientific, surer, and 
psychologically better to assume and to think in vast units 
of time, not merely to indulge the momentum of evolu- 
tionary thought but as an aid to clearer insight and to 
larger views of the universe.” “The visible universe is 
one of countless forms which its substance and energy 
have taken on, and the oldest objects in any corner of it 
are novelties to a mind vast and ancient enough to grasp 
the larger history of its eternal flux.” 
In the immeasurable beginning, when the earth was with- 
out form and void, there may have been a time when the 
very chemical elements, some eighty in number, which are 
at the basis of the material universe, were nonexistent, — 
when they, like man, were but possibilities. The transforma- 
tions of radium suggest how in the eons the distinctive 
molecules may have been formed by variation in number and | 
arrangement of primitive electrons. G. Stanley Hall, after — 
reviewing the new conceptions of matter and energy, and 
marshaling many impressive examples of the lifelike qual- — 
‘ities of glass, iron, mercury, colloids, crystals, and other 
inanimate substances, concludes that “ 
inorganic phases is perhaps more vividly active than life the world in its 
itself. The secrets of the origin of the soul are now more
-P-A-G-E-41
THE BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE 31 
clearly seen to be bound up, if not identical with, those of 
the origin of life . . . and their primordial germs must be 
coeval with the dawn of matter and with time itself.” 
In the fullness of time, perhaps one hundred million years 
ago, when all conditions were favorable, there somehow arose 
and spread in the primordial sea, which then bathed the 
globe, a highly complex substance whose every molecule 
was composed of hundreds of atoms, which again were 
composed of hundreds of electrons, and all so highly and 
peculiarly organized as to support life. Not only on this 
earth but possibly on millions of stars has this vital sub- 
stance, protoplasm, appeared, subsequently, to assume count- 
less forms and functions. No one knows how many the 
ages and the stages it took to bring forth even this primi- 
tive protoplasm, which anciently was structureless. Ages 
again elapsed before it evolved into definite, individual 
forms like the amoeba of to-day. 
The ameba is the most interesting and suggestive crea- 
ture under the sun. In the amceba life is reduced to some- 
thing like elementary terms ; not absolutely elementary, for 
even this humble creature is “the terminal of a vast past, 
as well as the germinal of a vast future.” But, roughly 
speaking, the amceba represents a simple archetype from 
which all the life forms in the animal kingdom have sprung, 
and the prototype of the embryo of every vertebrate, in- 
cluding man. In such a microscopic and microcosmic bit of 
protoplasm are, and were, packed all the manifold possi- 
bilities of life. 
Two students, who watched an amceba continuously for 
six days and five nights, declared that they saw in the drop 
of water under the lens of the microscope scenes so vividly 
dramatic as to be hardly describable without anthropomor- 
phic terms. There is danger of nature-faking here, as in all  
-P-A-G-E-42
  
82 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
interpretations of animal life, but the following can at least 
be said of the ameceba: first, “he” is sensitive to light, 
heat, mechanical, electrical, and chemical stimuli, to jars 
and shocks; second, he moves as much as one hundred forty- 
seven millimeters in ninety-six hours,—that is, he swims by 
thrusting out extemporaneous arms or legs, and lopes by 
lengthening and shortening his body as a whole; third, he — 
rests, — that is, he reposes after activity, and the rest and 
activity are proportionate to each other, following each 
other rhythmically ; fourth, he eats, — he seems to detect a 
  Fic. 4, An AM@BA PURSUING AND SWALLOWING Foop 
(From Gulick’s ‘ Control of Body and Mind ’’) 
paramecium even at a distance. He pursues his prey some- 
times as long as twenty minutes, closes the pseudopods 
about the struggling victim, and squeezes him to “ pulp.” 
The marvelous thing is that a unicellular bit of matter 
can perform all these essential functions. It is interesting to 
contemplate that such simple protozoans may once have been 
the sole representatives of life on this earth. Nature did not 
intend, however, that they should be the kings of creation, 
and that all types of life should remain tiny and aquatic. 
... The continents emerged from the depths of the sea; 
some say the moon was hurled, as a seething, catastrophic 
mass, from the mother earth; valleys and river beds took 
shape, and in the rank vegetation lumbered the reptiles of

  THE BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE 383 
gigantic bulk and name. Tremendous is the gap between 
the microscopic ameeba and the enormous diplodocus, the 
hugest animal that ever lived. And so it came to pass that 
the tribe of lizards were once the kings of creation. 
How shall we state biologically the difference between 
the amoeba and the diplodocus ? It is multiplication of 
cells,—differentiation of cells in structure and ‘specialization 
of cells in function. By all the forces which make for vari- 
ation and mutation, through natural selection and through 
other means only poorly known, the multifarious flora of 
land and sea were evolved, and all the million or more of 
animal species living and extinct. 
With evolution, cells take on different sizes, shapes, 
properties, and powers. Some serve the purposes of diges- 
tion, others of excretion, locomotion, circulation, respiration, 
coérdination. They lose their primitive power of self-sub- 
sistence, and persist only in relation to and support of neigh- 
boring cells. Cells of one kind can together constitute a 
tissue or an organ, but not an animal, and the variation in 
size, kind, and relative preponderance of these different 
tissues constitutes the manifold differences in the animal 
world. The earthworm in the dust has almost the full 
complement of tissues, and sovereign man is like the worm 
in that he consists primarily of a digestive tube; but super- 
imposed upon this tube are structures and organs relatively 
more perfect and important in him than in the worm. Im- 
personally speaking, the most radical difference between the 
two creatures is this: the worm has only a few long, com- 
plex neurons; man has millions upon millions. 
The newron may be instructively compared with the 
ameeba. Both are single cells, microscopic bits of proto- 
plasm with a nucleus and cytoplasm. But while the amceba 
has the power of locomotion and self-subsistence, the neuron
-P-A-G-E-44
34 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
exists and has importance only by virtue of its relationship 
to other cells. The neuron when mature, unlike the mobile 
amceba, has a definite shape and size. Typically, it has a 
diameter of, say, one two-hundredth of an inch, and has.two 
processes, —the dendrite, which is comparatively short,

tapering, grayish, and branched like a tree; the neurite, 
which is longer, and may be wrapped in a whitish, medullary 
insulating sheath. The neurite usually has short branches at 
right angles (collaterals), and an end tuft of tiny fibrils. 
Neurons differ enormously in shape and size: some look 
like hairy gourds, others like baskets or irregular spiders,

THE BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE 35 
and ‘still others resemble long trailing vines. The fibers, 
though unimaginably small in diameter, are over a yard long 
when they reach to the toe tip or other distant point of 
the body. : 
The neuron represents the acme of specialization. If all 
the manifold cells of our body were arranged in a hierarchy, 
the neurons would surely be perched highest, for they are the 
sentinel and captain cells which bring all the organs and 
functions of our body into harmonious codperation. They 
are also the basis of all conscious behavior, and it is through 
them that we become adjusted not only to our biological 
but to our social environment. 
There are three types of neurons, — the sensory, motor, 
associative. The sensory neurons are the most primitive. 
They constitute the innumerable outposts scattered through- 
out our sensitive periphery. There are hundreds of thou- 
sands of these which end,freely in the skin or terminate in 
microscopic end organs, ¥Che ce]] bodies of these cutaneous 
neurons are massed. in, thethirty-one pairs of spinal ganglia, 
enlargements of the spinal nerves arranged like beads along 
the spinal cord. These are the neurons which are respon- 
sive to pressure, warmth, cold, and pain stimuli. Similar 
neurons terminate in the sensitive linings of the internal 
‘organs, in the tendons, and in the joint surfaces. Tiny spe- 
cialized neurons are located in the retina of our two eyes, 
the rods and cones; in the organs of corti of our two ears; 
in the mucous membrane of our nose and mouth. All the 
neurons which have to do with the manufacture of afferent 
or inward impulses and their transmission are sensory. 
The motor neurons also have a wide distribution, for they 
supply the many muscles of- our body from scalp to toe, — 
the end organs of movement, which constitute 43 per cent 
of our body’s bulk. They also connect with certain glands, 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  36 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
like the perspiratory and salivary. These neurons carry 
the outward or efferent impulses, which result in many re- 
sponses, from the reflex eyewink, or watering of the mouth, 
to the pitching of a baseball. 
The associative neurons are neither afferent nor efferent in 
character. They are central in both position and function. 
They lie between and about the neurons which simply receive 
and discharge stimuli. Their business is to centralize, organ- 
ize, shunt, adjust, regulate, inhibit, and record stimuli. Their 
z peculiar plasticity, or 
memory, makes it pos- 
sible for them to re- 
tain past experiences 
and to modify present 
reactions not only in 
terms of present stim- 
uli but in terms of the 
past and even of the

Indeed, the whole nervous system is essentially nothing 
more than the grand total of its millions upon millions of 
neurons. Of course the nervous system also contains fibrous 
connective tissue in which these neurons are enmeshed, 
lymph in which they are bathed, and blood vessels which 
carry their nourishment. But these are only accessory 
structures. The anatomical and functional elements are 
the myriad of neurons,—a myriad unthinkably great, 
for Thorndike has calculated that it would take an in- 
dustrious duo-centenarian to count all the neurons ‘in a 
single human being. Put a hypothetical forceps anywhere 
in the nervous system, pluck a dendrite, pull, and you

could lift out a whole neuron. That is, neurons are not 
welded into each other; they are anatomically independ- 
ent; they touch without fusing. But this does not mean 
that they do not codperate ; for, junglelike and bewildering 
as the nervous system appears under the microscope, it is 
not a chance tangle. In every sane, normal being, order- 
liness and law prevail in the multitudinous impulses which 
dart in every direction through the mazes of dendrites 
and neurites. 
The neuron concept emphasizes the tremendous complex- 
ity of the nervous system, but also makes more comprehen- 
sible the main principles of its mechanism. Neurons are the 
essential elements of the end organs and of the nerves. A 
nerve is a dense cable of parallel neurons plus accessory    tissue. The spinal nerves consist of both sensory and motor 
neurons ; the cranial nerves exclusively of either, and some- 
times also of both. The spinal ganglia are collections of 
sensory cell bodies, thickenings of the nerves. The central 
gray column of the spinal cord consists of associative neu- 
rons, the end tufts of sensory, and the cell bodies and den- 
drites of motor neurons. The white matter of the spinal 
cord consists of the medullated strands of ascending and 
descending fibers continuous with or joining the sensory 
and motor neurons which make up the thirty-one pairs of 
spinal nerves. These sensory and motor tracts constitute 
the spinal projection system, so called because they project 
upon or terminate in the cerebral cortex. 
This cortex is the most wonderful and interesting struc- 
‘ture in the whole nervous system. Every point of this 
thin, grayish, shirred rind, half a square yard in extent, 
is connected directly or indirectly with every other part of 
the nervous system. As Meynert has put it, the cortex is 
a projection surface on which every muscle and sensitive

    40 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
The development of associative neurons in particular is 
correlated with the development of intelligence in the race 
and in the individual. Other things being equal, mental 
growth depends upon the number and complexity of asso- 
ciative neurons. The gross number in any child is absolutely 
determined by heredity. The idiot has fewer than the im- 
becile, and the imbecile may have fewer than the normal 
person. Though the full quota of neurons is provided at 
birth, most of them are undeveloped in early infancy, 
awaiting the touch of time and training. Only with months 
and years of experience do they grow and take on organiza- 
tion. Such organization and increasing complexity in the 
neurons also seem to be characteristic of the different stages 
in racial development. Cajal has arranged in an ascending 
series typical neurons from the lizard, frog, white rat, and 
man. ‘They show a progressive elaboration in the dendrites. 
The superiority of man is further reflected in the extent 
of his association areas. Those areas of the cortex which are 
directly and chiefly connected with the sense organs are called 
sensory; those which directly connect with muscles, motor ; 
and the intermediate areas —frontal, parietal, occipito- 
temporal, and the island of Reil—are the association 
areas. The latter do not connect directly with the end 
organs of sensation and movement, but are supplied chiefly 
by association fibers, which in myriad ways connect these 
association centers within themselves and with each other. 
A survey of the evolution of the nervous system will bring 
out the significance of the association centers. The amceba, 
of course, has no neurons, neither has the sponge. The mi- 
croscopic contractions of the circular muscles about the 
pores of the sponge result upon direct stimulation. The 
sponge is one of the very rare creatures in which the mus- 
cular cells and nerve elements are not found together. As
-P-A-G-E-51
  
THE BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE 41 
a rule they are interdependent and inseparable, and really 
constitute one indivisible system, the neuromuscular system. 
The sea anemone is a tiny, mobile digestive pouch, armed 
with active tentacles. Throughout its body walls are many 
muscle cells and simple neurons, both sensory and motor, 
which connect with the muscle cells and control their 
activity. The neurons of the sea anemone and the closely 
related hydra are diffusely scattered, and not compacted 
into nerves, ganglia, sense organs, or brain, but, by courtesy, 
they constitute a rudimentary nervous system. 
The insects represent a very ancient form of life on this 
globe. In them the nervous system is well developed. 
When Charles Darwin contemplated the wonderful possi- 
bilities of behavior residing in the frontal ganglia of an 
ant, he almost concluded that this tiny bit of nerve tissue 
is the most marvelous atom of matter in the universe. 
The insects, however, belong to a side branch of the tree 
of life, and so we pass to the earthworm, who is part of the 
main trunk. 
The earthworm is biologically higher than the sea anem- 
one. It is not so exclusively a digestive tube. It is well 
upholstered with muscles which make true locomotion 
possible. The increase in complexity of life in the air and 
on the ground was attended by the development of respira- 
tory, excretory, and circulatory organs, and a real nervous 
system. The earthworm has true nerves, some seven 
hundred and twenty of them, —three pairs for each seg- 
ment; a long chain of ganglia known as the ventral nerve 
cord, and special anterior ganglia, or a rudimentary brain. 
But there are only three giant nerve fibers to bind the 
various parts of the nervous system together. The remain- 
ing number of neurons are stubby, so that the system as a 
whole is highly segmental. The worm does not even have
-P-A-G-E-52
  42 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
a true spinal cord. In the amphioxus there is a dorsal rod 
of cartilage, which in the vertebrates becomes a backbone 
incasing a true spinal cord. 
The ancient history of our old earth is recorded in the 
successive geological strata. Scores of millions of years 
ago this process of stratification began. Similarly, the bio- 
logical history of man is reflected in the successive super- 
imposition of system upon system, organ upon organ, part 
upon part in our own old body, which has its archaeological 
traits like the earth itself. Our primitive digestive tube 
dates back to and is knit by heredity with the primitive 
digestive pouches of a Paleozoic age. Indeed, as Parker 
has pointed out, our intestinal walls in cross section reveal 
a neuromuscular mechanism substantially like that of the 
sea anemone. Tyler neatly summarizes the significant facts 
about the almost stratified human muscular system, as 
follows: “ Different parts are of very different age. Our 
trunk muscles originated in worms; those of shoulder and 
thigh in fish; those of arm and leg in amphibia; the hand, 
as such, was developed by arboreal mammals; the central 
portions are older, the peripheral younger.” 
The nervous system, which is so closely related to the 
muscular, has therefore naturally evolved somewhat on the 
installment plan, from fundamental to accessory. Although 
it is now knit into a highly unitary whole, it still reveals 
its accretive character. Its most ancient portion is repre- 
sented by the spinal cord, which controls the fundamental 
body reflexes. The spinal cord dates far back beyond the 
Devonian age. We share it with the lowest vertebrates. 
The medulla, cerebellum, and basal ganglia were all in the 
nature of subsequent installments; but these too are ancient 
when compared with the cerebral cortex. In the fishes the 
cortex is nonexistent, or little more than a seat for smell.
-P-A-G-E-53
THE BIOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE 43 
In the reptiles it is small, smooth, and slanting, and chiefly a 
sensory and motor center. The enormous Mesozoic dinosaurs 
were gigantic in brute strength but 
feeble in wit. Their muscular activi- 
ties were large, clumsy, and crude. 
The Tertiary mammals developed the 
power to run, jump, frisk, burrow, 
and clamber. These more complex 
activities required a larger number 
and more delicate arrangement of 
neurons for control and coérdination. 
With the enrichment and differentia- 
tion of movement the cortex grew in 
both size and complexity. 
Proceeding up the ani- 
mal scale, we find a sub- 
stantial similarity and. 
stability in the lowernerve 
centers, cord, medulla, and 
cerebellum. The advanc- 
ing portion is the cere- 
bral cortex,which keeps on 
_ deepening, furrowing, and. 
expanding, until finally, in 
the human species, the 
lower nerve centers are 
literally smothered under 
its bulging preéminence.

growth or medullation of the neurons continues in the 
human association areas as late as middle life. There is 
reason to believe that the period of plasticity in the racial 
cortex is being gradually prolonged, and that in a future

age the many neurons in the prefrontal region, at present 
undeveloped, will be called upon to meet the stimuli and 
stress of an increasingly complex environment. 
In the nervous system, mind and body, impulse and 
energy, psyche and soma, are in closest union. If there is 
psychic heredity as well as physical heredity, it is because 
the child inherits the nervous system of his parents. And 
if there is a kind of racial psychic heredity, it is because 
science has shown the nervous system of the child to be 
biologically continuous with that of his forebears. Instincts 
are modes of behavior acquired by the race and perpetuated 
in each new generation by the transmitted organizations 
and predispositions of millions of neurons. Thus fear and 
anger are as ancient as the frog; thus all the vital and 
enduring interests and experience of ancestors, of primitive 
man and his prehuman progenitors, tend to survive in the 
behavior of descendants, and the spirit of the past flickers 
up again in the unfoldment of every individual nervous 
system.

  CHAPTER V 
THE PRIMITIVE ANCESTRY OF THE CHILD 
Man is a migrating animal. We are all descended from 
immigrants. This migratory propensity is at work now. It 
was at work in prehistoric times. It moved even our pre- 
human ancestors. As a result, man very early settled the 
whole globe. 
Once upon a time this globe was not habitable. It was 
either a semimolten mass or a barren mineral sphere. Now 
our cities are built on a sedimentary masonry thousands of 
fathoms deep. How long did it take nature to evolve this 
crust, some fifty miles thick, on which we live? Four vast 
the Paleozoic, the Mesozoic, the Tertiary, and the 
Quaternary, aggregating, according to one geological esti- 
mate, some one hundred million years. 
Three fourths of this vast span belong to the Paleozoic 
period. In this period the most ancient stratified crystal- 
line rocks — quartzites, gneiss, and limestone — were devel- 
oped. In this era also were developed the most primitive 
forms of animal life, so viscid that they could not persist in 
fossil form. With the lapse of millions of years there ap- 
peared in due succession, through the gradual processes of epochs,   
transformism which have operated since the dawn of time, 
worms, crustacea, brachiopods, fish, amphibia, and reptiles. 
Representatives of all these genera appeared before the 
close of the long Paleozoic era. In the next era, the Meso- 
zoic, which lasted some ten million years, the reptiles — 
some of which attained an enormous size — came to their 
46
-P-A-G-E-57
THE PRIMITIVE ANCESTRY OF THE CHILD 47 
lordship of water, air, and land. This period also produced 
the archeopteryx, with toothed bill, vestigial wing-claws, 
and jointed tail feathers, — an early, uncanny bird, bearing 
all over the marks of his reptilian ancestry. 
The lowest Mesozoic mammals, likewise, were—closely 
allied to an ancestral reptilian form. The young of the 
monotreme to this day completes its development in a 
hatched egg. The marsupial mammals, who carry their off- 
spring in a protecting pouch, or fold of the skin, originated 
in Mesozoic times, while the higher placental mammals did 
not appear until Tertiary. The Primates, who constitute an 
independent order of the placentals, include the half-apes 
and the Anthropoidea. According to the zodlogical classi- 
fication the Anthropoidea are subdivided into five families, 
—the marmosets, the American monkeys, the tailed and 
tailless apes, and the Hominid, or man himself. 
The Tertiary era began some four million years ago. 
Even in this remote age the world had taken on many of its 
modern aspects, and could we have visited a mid-Tertiary 
meadow we should have seen enough familiar plants, 
grasses, flowers, insects, birds, and beasts to feel not alto- 
gether strange. The forests numbered oak, pine, cypress, 
spruce, and maples. Bees hummed, butterflies played in 
the sunshine, and birds sang. Most of the world was 
perennially bathed in warm weather. California sequoias 
grew as far north as Greenland, magnolias in Canada, and 
palms flourished over northern Europe. Not only the hyena, 
cave bear, and bison, but tropical and subtropical animals 
like the lion, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and elephant ranged 
throughout Britain and the continent with which it was 
still continuous. Sumatra and Java, like the British Isles, 
were then part of the mother continent. What is now the 
blue Mediterranean was a broad stretch of jungle and
-P-A-G-E-58
  48 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
prairie, alive with the colors, movements, and sounds of 
African fauna. In this region, where the great civilizations 
of the world were to plant their seaports, all was now a 
savage wild. France flared with abundant volcanoes, for in 
this period the earth’s crust was extensively unquiet, warp- 
ing into plateaus and buckling into lofty mountains. On 
one occasion an eruption in tropical Java buried a multitude 
of living beings. 
Several hundreds of thousands of years later Professor 
Dubois made excavations in the neighborhood of this erup- 
tion and unearthed masses of old bones from Tertiary ele- 
phants and other large mammals. Among these relics were 
a skull cap and thigh bone which prompted the interest of 
the whole anthropological world; for these two bones made 
it certain that a creature with human characteristics walked 
erect in Pliocene antiquity. 
The ambiguous name of this being, Pithecanthropus erectus, 
suggests his primitive character. He had the jaws and pro- 
truding brow ridges of a gorilla, but a cranial capacity little 
less than that of the-lowest living savage, and twice that 
of the highest ape. If not the first man, he represents at 
least man’s immediate precursor. ‘ 
It should be said, parenthetically, that this does not mean 
that the ape is a degenerate man, or that man is a devel- 
oped monkey, as uninformed people declare. Man is not 
descended from a monkey. Man and ape represent each a 
distinct species, equally descended from a common gener- 
alized prototype. This generalized, human-simian ancestor 
was the remote precursor of man, and lived in Miocene 
times, say a million years before Pithecanthropus erectus. 
It should also be said that in this chapter we are trying to 
tell a simple narrative, and not attempting a. critical discus- 
sion of the moot questions concerning the history of man.
-P-A-G-E-59
  
THE PRIMITIVE ANCESTRY OF THE CHILD 49 
There are wide differences in interpretations and chrono- 
logical estimates, and many matters are not settled. But 
that there have been genesis and growth, and a long, long 
period of development, every one nowadays agrees. For 
the teacher many of the details in geology and theories of 
descent are not important. But the genetic point of view, 
the feeling for the ancient biological antecedents, the psy- 
chological heredity and unfolding, the historical, recapitu- 
latory significance of childhood, — this is important. These 
large themes are surely worthy of some reflection by those 
who are dealing with growing children. 
There_is good reason to believe that the Indo-Malay _ 
country, where Homo Javanensis lived, was the cradleland 
of humanity, According to A. H. Keane, who holds the 
monogenetic theory in regard to human origin, the race 
had here its first center, and from here it dispersed to ulti- 
mately people the globe. “These generalized pleistocene 
precursors,” he says, ““ moved about like the other migrating 
faunas unconsciously, everywhere following the lines of least 
resistance, advancing or receding, and acting generally on 
blind impulse rather than of any set purpose.” 
Should we not have the courage of thought to picture to 
ourselves the character of these early migrations and immi- 
grants? There were, even in these rude hordes, mothers, 
fathers, and children, holding each other now and then by 
the hand, giving signals of warning and distress, assisting 
each other on the march. But these early forebears were 
indeed rude in outward aspect. Their eyes were peering 
and set deep under enormous brow ridges ; their lower jaws, 
large and strong. They wore no protecting garment other 
than their own semishaggy coat. Agile in their native 
homes, the trees, they walked the earth with clumsy gait, 
their broad shoulders stooping, their knees bent. The
-P-A-G-E-60
  
50 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
immaturity and imperfection of the sprawling infant do not 
excite disgust. Why should we not look with equanimity 
at least upon these first scenes in the childhood of the race ? 
This rude progenitor, though he traveled not by map or 
car, had within him the germs of the whole atlas of human 
culture. He already possessed the rudiments of speech, 
which is the instrument of all civilization. He could break 
  a branch and fashion it to serve a simple purpose ; this is the 
ability to make and use tools, and is the root of all mechan- 
ical achievement. The children clung to their mothers; the 
male fought and foraged to preserve mother and child. 
Eyen in the rough hordes the outlines of family life had 
emerged. There was parental sympathy, and this is the 
root of all morality. 
Those who desire to speculate about the mental traits 
of this most primitive human type can get suggestions from 
the psychology of man’s nearest anthropoid relative. Studies 
in the laboratory have shown that, even under the rather 
artificial conditions of captivity, the American monkey has 
a high degree of intelligence or associative memory ; that 
he has a certain amount of practical judgment, which is a 
simple form of reasoning ; that he does not learn exclusively 
by the mechanical process of trial and error; that he can 
imitate in a purposive, productive manner. Dr. Kinnaman’s 
two monkeys, Jack and Jill, learned to thread a compli- 
cated maze of seven blind alleys and twenty-seven corners 
in one hundred thirteen and sixty-six trials respectively. 
They also solved certain mechanical puzzles with the same 
rapidity and success as a doctor of philosophy. 
A most suggestive and intimate account of “ A Monkey 
with a Mind” has recently been furnished by Dr. Lightner 
Witmer. Peter, strictly speaking, is not a monkey, but 
a chimpanzee. The chimpanzee in many respects comes
-P-A-G-E-61
  THE PRIMITIVE ANCESTRY OF THE CHILD 51 
nearest to man. His arms are much shorter than the gorilla’s, 
reaching only a little below the knees; he also has a better- 
developed head, great toe, and thumb; his whiskers, eye- 
brows, lashes, and teeth approach the human in character ; 
he is said to be naturally more tractable and social, living 
not only in family groups but in parties of several families ; 
the male builds tree shelters for the female and young, 
and sleeps lower down to protect them. 
Peter has been taken away from his African arboreal en- 
vironment, has been put into evening clothes, and brought 
before the audiences of large cities. To come at close range 
with Peter’s powers, Dr. Witmer made several private ex- 
aminations, and finally brought him before his psychological 
clinic, subjecting him to certain mental tests used in diag- 
nosing the intellectual grade of backward and defective 
children. All these observations resulted in the interest- 
ing conclusion that Peter ranks upon the plane of a low or 
middle-grade human imbecile. He has decided motor dex- 
terity; he skates on roller skates, learning by himself in 
a few hours; he rides a bicycle, drinks from a tumbler, 
eats with a fork, threads a needle, lights and smokes a 
cigarette, strings beads, and puts pegs in a board; he shows 
a high degree of practical judgment in opening a strange 
lock and selecting a needed key from a key ring; he can 
use a hammer, drive a nail, drive a screw, and select the 
proper screw driver for his purpose ; he partially succeeded 
even with the classic test of inserting various geometrical 
blocks into a special form board with shallow depressions ; 
but most mirabile dictu, after a W had been drawn on the 
blackboard he copied it in direct tracery imitation. He can 
articulate “mama,” and learned in a five-minute phonic drill 
to pronounce “ P.” He shows decided powers in compre- 
hension of language. His emotional traits are no less

wonderful, for his mobile face expresses in turn nonchalance, 
eagerness, disappointment, courage, distress, protest, inquiry, 
affection, and “ at hs he even has something very like 
a momentary grin of humor, albeit ghastly because of the 
cavernous mouth and huge jaw.” 
It has been suggested that the apelike man of Java may 
be regarded as an intermediate transitional form which 
fills the anatomical gap between modern man and his brute 
ancestors. There is a similar psychological gap or chasm. 
This chasm, Dr. Witmer 
holds, Peter’s mind practi-

conclusion is that “ the study

psychologist, but for the child psychologist.” 
To come back to the first dispersion of the human spe- 
cies. No one can, of course, say how long it took for man 
to spread over the whole habitable globe. His rate of in- 
crease may have been fast, but, while nimble in the trees, 
his progress on the ground must have been gradual. The 
climate, however, was uniformly mild, and his complete 
occupation of the world was probably under way by the 
close of the dey epoch. In this remote age there were of

course no nations, — not even races. This early man was a 
generalized ancestor, from whom the four primary divisions 
of the human species— Negro, Mongolian, American, Cauca- 
sian — were not to diverge until hundreds of thousands of 
years had elapsed. 
The home of most primitive man was like that of the 
Swiss family Robinson. Not only in appearance, but to some 
extent in habits, he must have resembled his nearest kin. 
His food consisted of roots, berries, plants rich in cellulose, 
nuts, honey, and insects. He had few ornaments of beauty 
and tools of utility. Some writers have even questioned 
whether he had the cortical neurons that would enable him 
to talk. At any rate his utterances were thick and clung 
to the base of his tongue; for nimbleness and subtlety of 
articulation go with the development of abstract ideas, of 
which he possessed very few. His life was probably arboreal 
until the increasing cold climate drove him into caves. 
With the close of the Tertiary epoch a great _meteor- 
ological and geological "change came over the earth, which 
had_a powerful effect t upon the natural history of man. 
Mysteriously, from the north, crept a great ice cap, which 
covered a good part of the northern hemisphere with gla- 
ciers and icebergs. As mysteriously it retreated, to reappear 
at least once again. In the warm interglacial period —a 
duration of perhaps five hundred thousand years — the 
first achievements of truly human culture were made. In 
this period fall the eolithic and the paleolithic age, —the 
latter lasting, according to Keane, about three hundred 
thousand years. Even though these figures are but an 
estimate, they will serve to impress the thoughtful reader 
with the comparative brevity of our historical era, the ancient 
lineage of our civilization, and the very primitive ancestry 
of the modern child.

54 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
Paleolithic man — and woman too — was a hunter. The 
ice invasion may have exterminated some of his most dan- 
gerous foes, but there were enough ferocious species left 
to call forth all his fear and fight and cunning. His con- 
temporaries, although he lived as far north as England, were 
the cave bear, the cave lion, the cave hyena, the wild ox, 
wild boar, wild horse and wolf, hippopotamus, and woolly 
rhinoceros. But most terrible of all was the huge, saber- 
toothed tiger, with his enormous jaw, his dagger teeth, and 
  Fic. 12. Tae Cairn

powerful wrenching neck muscles. This most deadly of 
all beasts struck terror even to the shaggy-maned mam- 
moth. With such enemies, and no protection but the cav- 
erns and overhanging cliffs, the primeval savage was put 
to his wit’s end. In the beginning he did not even have 
fire to drive the wild beasts away. The night was utterly 
dark, filled with ominous silences and terrifying sounds — 
bellowing, splashing, roars, snorts, and howls; and if he 
heard the voice of his own humankind, it usually was 
nothing more than jabber, grunt, or cry. 
 
-P-A-G-E-65
  
THE PRIMITIVE ANCESTRY OF THE CHILD 55 
But though he had not the brute strength of the beasts, 
he had intelligence in greater measure than any of them. 
Intelligence is the capacity to profit by experience. It de- 
pends upon a nervous system plastic enough to form habits. 
Professor Yerkes built an experimental aquarium to test 
whether the frog has such a nervous system. A hungry 
frog was introduced at the aperture a, shown in the ac- 
companying diagram. The question was, Would the frog 
learn the direct route a— 6, or would he do no more than 
instinct prompted him; that is, move about aimlessly and 
unintelligently ? He proved to be educable. After some 
      
  Fie. 13. Test or AnrMAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE Frog 
fifty to one hundred trials he pursued the proper path, 
and when retested a few weeks later showed that he had re- 
tained his acquisition. The ability and propensity to swim, 
snap at flies, and hibernate were provided by nature in 
the inborn constitutional organization of the frog’s nervous 
system. Habit formation, on the contrary, depends upon 
the connections between neurons which are established only 
throughthe-touch of experience. Intelligence does not 
supplant instinct, but supplements it. Both instinct and 
intelligence increase with the evolution of the nervous sys- 
tem. Primitive man, therefore, was superior to the animals 
with whom he contended in natural instinctive endowment

as well as in capacity to learn. This double advantage 
made him in time the one universal, dominant species. 
He succeeded in paleolithic times in planting himself 
over the whole habitable earth. His rude relics have been 
found the world over. The stones which he at first only 
hurled, or piled as a safety wall at the mouth of his cave, 
he learned to fashion, by breaking and chipping into various 
implements, — spearheads, axes, knives, saws, and scrapers. 
He gradually grew in his power to make tools and to con- 
trive. He learned to fasten a heavy stone to a lance, to

give it death-dealing force when dropped upon a mastodon 
or sabertooth. He also made pitfalls, snares, and traps. 
When the hunt was successful all gathered around the car- 
cass, drank its warm blood, ate its raw meat, and sucked 
the nutritious marrow from the bones. We need not shrink 
from the picture, for the near descendants of this same say- 
age made awls and borers of the bones, etched drawings upon 
them, and even made flutes of them to bring forth music. 
Paleolithic man was not merely a gnawer of bones. Nor must 
we forget, as Spencer has reminded us, that out of these 
same savages came at length our Newtons and Shakespeares.
-P-A-G-E-67
    THE PRIMITIVE ANCESTRY OF THE CHILD 57 
Before a Newton came, however, the race had to pass 
through several more primary grades of culture. The paleo- 
lithic period in Europe came to a close, roughly speak- 
ing, with the disappearance of the last icé sheet. That was 
about a hundred thousand years ago. Of these one hun 
dred millenniums, seventy belong to the neolithic period, 
twenty to the metal ages, and ten to historic times 
(Keane’s estimate). 
The neolithic age was a golden period in the larger his- 
tory of man. It has been questioned whether he has ever 
since shown quite so much creative power. In this period 
language became organic ; religious ideas developed ; social 
groups were formed by the combining of families and clans ; 
pile dwellings and kitchen middens, ditch dwellings and 
circular huts, were built for the living; graves were dug 
for the dead; sepulchral chambers and monuments, mega- 
lithic and monolithic, were reared the world over. The art 
of stock breeding, of making polished stone implements, 
spinning, weaving, mining, and pottery were all begun. 
Both plants and animals were domesticated, — cereals and 
vegetables, fruits, dogs, sheep, horses, and cows. But the 
supreme achievement was the conquest of fire; neolithic 
man domesticated fire, and fire domesticated him. 
How the picture changes when fire lights up the dark, 
repelling the prowling beasts, brightening the gloomy cave, 
and drawing whole families to its friendly warmth! Fire 
worked a revolution. Woman became the fire keeper ; food 
was no longer eaten raw; cooking brought concentrated 
instead of bulky meals. This dietary change reduced the 
stomach capacity and size of the jaw, and freed a vast 
amount of kinetic energy for man’s further uplift. 
The first centers of neolithic culture were probably in 
the favored region of the Nile and the Euphrates, where
-P-A-G-E-68
  58 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
the climate was temperate even during the ice age. With 
progress in civilization and increase in numbers migrations 
became frequent. From the south streamed a tall, dolicho- 
cephalic people, who mingled with or replaced their ruder 
predecessors in Europe. Later, it is thought, hordes smaller 
in stature, and brachycephalic, came from the East. Still 
later — perhaps twenty-five thousand years ago — came the 
migrations of pastoral, Aryan-speaking tribes. This was a 
twofold invasion — one by tall, blonde, long heads from the 
Eurasian steppes; the other by short, dark, round heads 
from Armenia, through Asia Minor. The speech of these 
probably conquering peoples persists, but as a distinct race 
they have vanished, mingling with a hundred other stocks 
already in possession of Europe. 
These Aryan peoples had a primitive pastoral culture. 
They reared herds of cattle, sheep, and goats, and made the 
dog their friend and helper. They constructed rude wagons 
by charring and chopping axle and wheels from a single 
tree trunk. They built round huts of sod and branches, 
but in the winter they lived in caves. Their clothing was 
undressed skin, or, later, rough wool and flax. The wives 
were captured for marriage, and were put to death when 
the husband died. Yet Keane says, “They were a gifted 
people, who, more than any other, may be supposed by 
their very dispersion to have leavened the rude prehistoric 
masses, thus raising a great part of humanity to a higher 
social plane.” 
The Teutonic type of Aryan became specialized in a 
second home, the Baltic land, from where he later spread 
over Europe, and still-later over most of the world. The 
Germans described by Tacitus represent the primitive man 
who lies closest to us in point of time and culture, and 
with many of us in direct blood relationship. It surely is
-P-A-G-E-69
    THE PRIMITIVE ANCESTRY OF THE CHILD 59 
interesting to contemplate that the forebears of that boy in 
the front seat, only two thousand years ago, were lounging 
and hunting in the woodlands of Germany, “loving indo- 
lence and hating tranquillity,” — superstitious, loyal, brave, 
brutal, and highminded forest children, clad in the skin of 
beasts. 
Whatever we may think of the culture-epoch theory, 
there is without doubt a general parallelism between child- 
hood and primitive man. The child has both an intellectual 
and an emotional sympathy for primitive life. He can 
appreciate its problems because they are simple, crude, and 
within his mental grasp. He warms up to the problems 
because they appeal to his instinctive nature. As Hall has 
said, “The child is not so much the father of the man as 
at first his most primitive and half-anthropoid ancestor.” 
Later he evolves into something of a savage and then of a 
barbarian, if he does not repeat with definiteness the hunt- 
ing, fishing, pastoral, and agricultural stages of civilization. 
Dr. John Dewey, Dr. Katherine Dopp, and Miss Emily 
Rice of Chicago University have shown in various ways, 
both practical and theoretical, how the natural bond between 
primitive man and the child can be recognized and utilized 
in education. The teacher who hopes to induct the child 
into the past must evoke the past in the child. She can 
do this only by having a warm sympathy for primitive 
peoples, both living and extinct. To have this sympathy 
one must psychologize and get into the very motives, fears, 
failures, joys, capacities, and imaginations of primitive man. 
Only then can his mythology, the story of his combat with 
nature, and his industrial achievements be made to tingle 
with reality. It is no easy thing to get into the soul of 
primitive man, but it is no harder than to get into the soul 
of a child.
-P-A-G-E-70
  
60 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
That there is a certain psychological identity between 
primitive man and the child was not proved, but was 
brought home with all the suggestiveness of a parable, 
through a simple story recently told by the curator of an 
archeological museum. This curator, a man of broad sym- 
pathies, says that he learns something from almost every 
visitor with whom he converses. p 
Once a child came into the museum. To amuse her he 
spilled a handful of ringlike shells into her lap and told 
her to play. These shells, which had been found in great 
  Fig. 15. Neckiace or SHELLS 
numbers associated with the remains of Catalina Indians, 
were then the subject of some discussion. The learned 
ethnologists and anthropologists had vaguely concluded 
that the shells were used as spangles or ornaments. After 
‘a half hour’s play, in which the child had expressed the 
same venerable instinct of workmanship which she shared 
with the extinct Indians, she brought back a beautiful 
necklace, in which the shells were interwoven simply but 
effectively in a way which the wise doctors could never 
have thought out. It was a revelation. A child in natural 
play restored and repeated a chapter in the life of a 
primitive people.

CHAPTER VI 
INSTINCT AND RELAXATION 
Some one has said that the more we know about the past 
the less we respect it. This aphorism may be true with 
certain social conventionalities and pretensions, but it is 
viciously false with regard to the deepest laws of life. 
Nature is too unitary and continuous to permit it to be 
true. The present is born of the past and the past abides 
in the present, and to understand the present we must 
appreciate the past. That is the excuse of the two fore- 
going chapters, which, although they may be but rough 
sketches, surely emphasize the fact that the child is the 
product of a most remote and remarkable antiquity. 
How far back we trace this pedigree is a matter of taste. 
Surely we are descended from the neolithic Europeans who 
lived over a score of millenniums ago, and these in turn were 
descended from paleolithic ancestors who chipped rough 
stone implements for some three hundred thousand years. 
And if we add the vague eolithie period, we may, say that 
the span of man’s distinctly human sojourn on this earth 
measures a half million years. Some would multiply this 
by two, and if we include the postulated Miocene precursor 
of man, we shall have to multiply by five or six, or even 
more. The zodlogist, of course, does not stop even here. 
He tries to reconstruct the whole tree of life, assigning to 
the different branches and heights of the main stem a defi- 
nite geological age. The tracks of worms are found in rocks 
which we know are scores of millions of years old. The

evolutionist is sure of our genetic relationship with these 
same Pre-Cambrian worms. The fish is certainly a zo6logical 
descendant of the aquatic worm., A student of Haeckel has 
calculated that the number of generations which lie between 
the lowest fish and man is fifty millions. To be unconscious 
of this tremendous range of prehuman and human existence 
is never to have realized the comprehensiveness compacted 
in the present. 
Comparative anatomy has worked out with surprising 
success, organ for organ, our minute and gross structural 
similarity to the lower animals. The psychologist and teacher 
“are, however, chiefly interested in the comparative facts 
which relate to consciousness and behavior. There is psychic 
heredity as well as physical hereflity. In spite of the fact 
that dog, horse, sheep, goat, cow, and pig have been domes- 
ticated since primitive neolithic times, they still betray 
tendencies and modes of behavior which belong peculiarly 
to their feral state. Dr. Louis Robinson has written a charm- 
ing book on the wild traits of the domesticated animals, which 
man has tamed but not completely transformed. 
he dog before he lies down to sleep, it may be on a 
parlor carpet, turns about in an idiotic circle, as though he 
were still a Miocene wolf and had to trample down a bed 
  of grass and weeds. ‘The western horse bucks, shakes and 
puts down his head as though the saddle on his back were 
really a clutching panther and had to be shaken off. The 
cow secretes her newborn calf in the tall growth of meadow, 
as though she were still living in the age of fear. ‘The in- 
dependence, sure-footedness, caution, obstinacy, and unshak- 
able nerves of the donkey and goat date back to an ancient, 
self-reliant life in the mountains. The angry ewe stamps 
her feet when approached by a dog, who looks much like a 
wolf to her, and this is “a remnant of an old killing activity.”
-P-A-G-E-73
  
INSTINCT AND RELAXATION 63 
The greediness, grunt, squeal, keen scent, and expert snake- 
destruction powers of the pig are reminiscent of the grega- 
rious wild-boar days in the lowlands. 
There are decided differences in the mentality and atti- 
tudes of dog and cat. The tribe of tigers belongs to the 
solitary animals who depend for survival upon individual 
cunning, ferocity, and prowess. Inasmuch as the house 
cat traces her lineage to the tiger family, Robinson has 
boldly asserted that she lacks the capacities for companion- 
ship so well developed in the dog, who for centuries lived 
the social life of the pack and there learned the rudiments 
of helpfulness, loyalty, and sensitiveness. The cat, to be sure, 
loves to rub against you, and to nestle in your arms, which 
serve for a snug crotch. But perhaps she regards you in 
her dim way as nothing but a specially comfortable peri- 
patetic tree. The dog, however, regards the household as 
he did the old wolf pack, and the master as the benevolent 
leader of the pack ; hence all the faithfulness, sympathy, and 
affection which have made him the favorite of pets. A dog 
cannot help but. be cynomorphic in his mentality and atti- 
tude. To interpret even his comparatively simple psycholog 
we must take account of the past, for the wild survives in 
the tame and the past in the present. 
Can it be otherwise with the child ? Childhood is some- 
thing more than a simple, undifferentiated period of plastic- 
ity or imperfection_If the modern facts of heredity point 
to anything, it is that childhood is charged with the propen- 
sities of the past. And these propensities all have a history 
and significance, which the following survey of the human 
instincts will try to suggest. 
Instincts-are inborn propensities or modes of behavior 
common to the species. They are as innate and characteris- 
tic as peculiarities of structure. They belong to the creature
-P-A-G-E-74
  64 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
as much as his claws or his snout, and are as essential 
for his survival; for structure and function are inseparable, 
and instincts furnish the impulses which impel the crea- 
ture to use his organs for self and species perpetuation. 
There is no sudden or dramatic appearance of instinct in 
the animal kingdom, no satisfactory theory of the method 
of its origin. Even plants have definite modes of behavior 
in the presence of light, gravity, moisture, etc., called tro- 
pisms. These very elementary adjustments with reference 
to stimuli are essentially physicochemical in nature, ac- 
cording to Loeb, who thinks that tropisms explain many 
reactions in animals as well as in plants. These tropisms, or 
their equivalent, stand for a type of behavior more primitive 
than instinct. With the evolution of a nervous system defi- 
nite instincts associated with distinct cravings finally are 
differentiated to displace, or possibly supplement, the tro- 
pisms. At first the instincts are simple, few, and intermit- 
tent. With advance in the animal scale they multiply, and 
man has a larger complement than any of his forebears, for 
the simple reason that he cannot escape his accumulated 
inheritance. A rough classification of his many instincts 
distributes them into four or five groups. J ’ 
I. The self-preservative instincts. Self-preservation is the 
first law of nature, and the most fundamental instincts are 
those which most directly enforce this law,- Hunger and 
thirst and the pant for breath are the deepest of all cravings, 
but’ they are not the sole expression of the primordial food 
quest. Out of the securing and defending of food supplies 
grew a more generalized desire to have and to hold, now 
called the proprietary instinct. This is one of the most pro- 
tean impulses, and colors in ways innumerable both child 
and adult behavior. It would almost seem that instinct, like 
matter, is imperishable, and that man retains all the past
-P-A-G-E-75
INSTINCT AND RELAXATION 65 
momentum of this impulse to gain something, assimilate it, 
and make it his own. This instinct used to go out to food 
alone ; now it goes out to all sorts of things, material and 
. immaterial. 
A special form of the proprietary instinct is hoarding, and 
inet which seizes 
  closely related to this is collecting, an ins 
upon almost every boy or girl, and never altogether dies 
out. It begins before the kindergarten age with the collec- 
tion of knickknacks, stones, leaves, \etc., and mounts high 
about the age of ten. The interest in collection burns so 
strong and is often so spontaneous that it can only be ac- 
counted for by an intensity enjoyed in earlier racial devel- 
opments Hunting and migrating, both in animals and it 
primitive man, are obviously associated with the feeding 
instinct. To this day truancy seems to vary with the nutri- 
tion of the body, and with theseason of the year. And the 
peculiar zest with which a oy uses a bow and arrow, gun 
or fishing rod, the consuming interest with which he stalks 
his prey, suggest the survival of ancestral life values. 
Locomotion is as fundamental as feeding itself, and, of 
course, closely related to it. The manner in which the 
powers of locomotion develop in the child strongly indicates 
* that the race did not always walk erect. The newborn babe 
can clasp a stick with strength enough in hands and arms 
to suspend its whole weight for several moments. In arbo- 
real life a babe must cling to the climbing mother. Hands 
and arms, therefore, precede the development of the legs. 
All hand-grasping is at first clumsy, but in about three 
months a baby can oppose the thumb to the finger, a power 
which, by the way, the race did not always have. Before 
the end of the first year the child usually shows instinctive 
right-handedness.. There are distinguishable stages in the 
assumption of it erect posture. First the head is held up;
-P-A-G-E-76
66 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
then when the appropriate nerve centers ripen, the baby 
insists on sitting up. Next he rolls or hitches, humps, 
crawls or creeps. Climbing also appears before he walks. 
This uncontrollable tendency to climb, Miss Amy Tanner 
regards as “a genuine instinct dating back to the time when 
men lived chiefly in trees, when strength of arm and grasp 
were essential to life.” She thinks that direct harm must 
come from undue repression of this instinct. 
But life, even with the lower animals, is more than a 
matter of food supply. There are dangerous things and 
fellow creatures to avoid or overcome. Out of these dangers | 
spring fear and fight. The fearing instincts are perhaps 
the more primitive, for it is easier to avoid than to over- 
come. Recall the untold centuries in which man lived in 
insecurity, and it is easy to understand why a considerable 
and often extreme capacity of fear should survive in child 
hood. Any strange, sudden, or overpowering object inspires 
the sense of helplessness, dread, or terror, and mildly or 
profoundly disturbs circulation, breathing, and gland secre- 
tion. Trembling, pallor, fleeing, crouching, hiding, and cold 
sweat are natural reactions at least partially explainable on 
an evolutionary basis. Many fears are, of course, acquired, 
but often specific fears, such as the fear of large eyes, of fur, 
and of big teeth, come so early in babyhood as to seem purely 
inborn. Statistics show that the most numerous children’s 
fears are of thunder and lightning, strange persons, beasts, 
_the weather, and the elements. Bashfulness is an extremely 
interesting manifestation of fear. All children have some 
general fund of inherited timidity, dread, caution, and awe 
worth observing and educating. 
The typical preyed-upon fauna have chiefly fear in their 
composition. It is in their powerful and ferocious enemies 
that the pugnacious instincts are pronounced. But the 
   
-P-A-G-E-77
INSTINCT AND RELAXATION 67 
‘history of anger is ancient. Animals so zoélogically old as 
the fish and the frog wilgshow fight. An absolutely anger- 
less normal child is inconceivable. Even deficient children, 
in whom so many instincts and capacities are lacking, 
frequently retain a great deal of temper, because anger is 
so deep-seated in the race. The instinctive expressions and 
special manifestations of fighting, such as gnashing, jaw 
tension, fist clenching, stamping, sttiking, teasing, bullying, 
and cruelty, point to its ancient association with the preser- 
vation of self and the destruction of others. But since in 
man we do not expect instincts always to survive in their 
original drastic brutality, we may look for the fight instinct 
in such temperamental characteristics as_ self-assertion, 
domination, executiveness, forcefulness, etc. Some chil- 
dren seem to have more fear than fight in their natures. 
Many of their traits depend upon hereditary endowment 
in-kind and degree of instincts. Character is not only a 
bundle of habits but also a bundle of instincts. 
Il. The Mating and Parental Instincts. The second group 
of instincts comprises those which cluster about the pro- 
duction of offspring to perpetuate the species, which is of 
more concern to nature than the preservation of the indi- 
vidual. Deeply implanted, therefore, are the instincts of 
mating, and in higher animals special instincts of courtship, 
coyness, and sexual jealousy. 
Jane Addams, in discussing The Quest for Adventure, 
gives candid recognition to these instinctive factors in human 
conduct. Speaking of the two elemental appetites behind 
“the activities of primitive man and his uncivilized succes- 
sors,” she says: ““The first drove him to the search for food, 
the hunt developing into war with neighboring tribes, and 
finally broadening into barter and modern commerce; the 
second urged him to secure and protect a mate, developing 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  68 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
into domestic life, widening into the building of homes and 
cities, into the cultivation of the agts and a care for beauty.” 
This fine statement shows how the so-called lower and 
blind instincts may be transmuted into higher attitudes and 
sentiments. There never can be absolute repression ; it is 
always a problem of expression, for the old instincts are 
the raw material of all energy. The healthy sexual develop- 
ment of the young, both in its physiological and psycho- 
logical phases, is coming to be of more critical and frank 
concern with sociologists and educators. Primary school- 
teachers should appreciate that the problem begins before 
the period of adolescence. 
In this sphere, behavior rises above the plane of brute 
egoism. The germ of all love can be sought in the rude 
and transitory impulses which bring offspring into the 
world and protect them in their helplessness. With ascent 
in the animal scale, the period of infant helplessness in- 
creases and parental sympathy is correspondingly prolonged 
and deepened. Homes are built to shelter the family; 
jealous rage flares up in the protecting parent, and in the 
lick, nestle, and caress are hidden tenderness. Indeed, the 
taproot of our moral sentiment has been’ traced to parental 
sympathy. Here also is the germ of altruism, which in the ~ 
human extends beyond the narrow limits of the family, and 
may embrace the whole community. In social’ reformers 
and the great teachers it sometimes extends to distant and 
foreign peoples, to the whole world, and even to generations 
unborn. Doll play and the rearing and caring for pets 
constitute a childish fore-expression of the parental instinct. 
From this instinct teaching and other social welfare work 
get much of their motivation. 
Ill. The social-instincts. Even in the world of the lower 
animals the individual and the family are not all. There
-P-A-G-E-79
  INSTINCT AND RELAXATION 69 
are larger social groups, — the flock, swarm, pack, the herd. 
If man is preéminently a social animal, it is because he 
has been preceded by a long line of gregarious ancestors. 
Gregariousness, or herding, is probably the most funda- 
mental of the social instincts, for it is this which keeps the 
groups cohesive, gives the individual a dim consciousness 
of kind, and causes him to suffer a sort of nostalgia when 
detached. Galton has given us a brilliant description of 
the sociability of the South African ox: “When separated 
from his herd, he exhibits every sign of mental agony, and 
. . . he becomes a prey to the extremest terror. He strives 
“ with all his might and main to get back, and when he suc- 
ceeds he plunges into the middle, to bathe his whole body 
with the comfort of closest companionship.” In children we 
should call it cuddling up, 
3ut simple gregariousness does not insure a Utopian 
commonwealth. With animals, as with men, group life 
favors a new kind of social selfishness and _ self-assertion. 
Instincts of rivalry, deception, showing off, and jealousy arose 
under competitive conditions in animal communities, and 
were much accentuated by the social institutions-of—both 
barbarous and civilized man. Extreme self-aggrandizement, 
“however, would-destroy the very existence of the social 
groups, and so, in innumerable ways, counterbalancing 
instincts of sympathy and codperation arose beside the 
aggressive traits. Kropotkin has filled a whole volume 
with examples in proof of his thesis that “ mutual aid is a 
factor in evolution on a par with mutual struggle.” These 
mutual aid instincts were so early developed that com- 
~munistic ownership, according to Letourneau, prevailed 
among primitive people. School and society are trying to 
favor the expression of these instincts of mutual aid, which 
came late in racial history and need encouragement.
-P-A-G-E-80
  70" : THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
Social life favors. language. Expressiveness, both in ges- 
tures and cries, varies with sociability. Animals possess the 
rudiments of language in common with man, —the reflex 
cries of emotion, the rude interjections of fear, rage, alarm, 
the grunts of disgust, etc. With the higher mammals and 
apes the vocabulary of these language-cries numbers scores 
and even hundreds. Haeckel thinks that there was anciently 
a Homo alalus; but even this most primitive man, who pre- 
ceded Homo sapiens, must have had the gesture and interjec- 
tional language from which articulate speech finally emerged. 
The mobility of lips, tongue, and laryngeal muscles, and, 
perhaps, right-handedness, favored increasing subtlety in 
articulation, which did more than anything else to raise man 
above his pristine compeers. 
Underlying the instincts of mutual aid is the instinct of 
docility, the natural tendency to obey leaders and the ex- 
‘ample of others. This is a very broad trait in human 
nature, almost indistinguishable in its rudimentary form 
from passive plasticity or habituation. But it has an active 
expression as denoted by the word “obedience.” This obedi- 
ence is at first reflex, and as mechanical as the following- 
instinct in sheep. But in man the instincts do not preserve 
their primal simplicity ; they become overlaid with other 
instincts, and with ideas, concepts, and ideals. This primi- 
tive obedience is transformed by love and fear into all 
grades and manners of reverence and awe, — hero worship, 
God and nature worship, respect for law, and many special 
attitudes toward the beautiful, the scientific, and the good, 
which, if not instincts, are in origin instinctive. 
IV. Play instincts. The above instincts, comprehensive as 
the list is, only partially account for the impulses of human 
conduct, and do not explain its development and many-sided 
adaptiveness. There is a very important group of instincts  
-P-A-G-E-81
  INSTINCT AND RELAXATION pf ek 
Cif the tem is to be preserved) which are fundamentally 
developmental and “ adaptive” in character, — instincts $0 
generic that they underlie, overlay, modify, inhibit, rehearse, 
extend, conserve, and exercise the other instincts. These 
are the instinct-tendencies of self-activity and relaxation. 
Play is the generic instinct of spontaneous self-activity. 
Froebel appreciated play. .The plays of childhood, he said, 
and are “the ” “spring from inner impulse and necessity, 
germinal leaves of all later life.” Schiller and Spencer 
speak of play as the expression of surplus energy. Groos, 
not content with this limited conception, and feeling the 
significance of Darwin’s work on instincts, made a very 
extended study of play in man and animals. He concluded 
that(play is not merely an outlet for superabundant energy, 
but is nature’s method of preparing the young for the seri- 
ous occupations. of maturity) In play the inherited impulses 
and powers are exercised, trained, prepared. Play is antici- 
patory. G. Stanley Hall believes, on the other hand, that 
the/ key to all pla play activities lies in the ny and not in the 
future. Play for him is reminiscent, —‘‘the motor habits 
and spirit of the race persisting in the present.” Play is so 
protean that all these views are in a measure true. As 
Russel has neatly said, “Play is at once reminiscent and 
anticipatory, a welding of the future and the past.” 
The sphere of play is so intricately complex that it mocks 
precise formulations.~Some plays do seem to be chiefly the 
outlets for obstructed or overflowing energy. Such are many 
of the random, sprawling movements of the well-fed baby, 
also rolling, kicking, jumping, romping, and “ the immodest 
runnings and horrid shoutings” referred to by a medieval 
university. Joyous laughter also falls here. These plays, 
for want of a better term, may be called the “ plays of ex- 
uberance.” A common characteristic is that they tingle with
-P-A-G-E-82
72 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
the feeling of well-being, euphoria, and tend to be repetitive 
and rhythmical, as in laughter and skipping and dancing. 
Rhythm lies very near to play. 
Closely related is that play which is chiefly for psycho- 
motor exercise, like sliding, teetering, dragging, hustling, 
tossing, balancing, tumbling, rocking, and much of the per- 
sistent play with the senses and motor apparatus. In these 
plays it seems to be nature’s main intent to train the powers 
of perception and movement. 
Another group of plays and many games are more par- 
ticularly recapitulatory in character, definitely suggestive 
of prehuman and prehistoric activities. Such are the plays 
of hiding, daring, fighting, hurling, hunting; of strategy, 
climbing, chasing, shooting, collecting, hoarding, exploring, 
camping, caring for flowers, plants, andypets; also the 
absorbing interest in the heroic and stirring stories of com- 
bat, fear, and cunning. In these plays and interests we feel 
, and G. Stanley Hall 
thinks that “the pleasure. is always exactly proportional most fully and intensely ancestral joys.     
to the directness and force of the current of heredity.” 
Imitation is bound up with play: It has been said that 
the child cannot live life, so he must play it. Here the word 
“play” is used almost synonymously with “dramatic imita- 
tion.” A vast amount of play tends to be imitative ; and this 
is one of the best. arguments for Groos’s contention that play 
is the means of preparing for future serious activity. For 
the dramatic and imitative plays of children surely initiate 
them intothe situations and problems of adult life: doll play 
initiates into domestic life, playing store into commercial, 
playing war into military, ete. The dramatic tendency of. 
play can be used by.the teacher not only to bring the child 
into a consciousness of his future problems, but also into 
an appreciation of literature and history.
-P-A-G-E-83
INSTINCT AND RELAXATION 73 
The most extensive, pervasive, and fundamental type of 
play is workmanship. Since precise classification is almost 
hopeless in the field of play, “workmanship” may well be 
used as a blanket term to cover all those aggressive im- 
pulses which spring from a spontaneous desire to trans- 
form physical things or mental content,—in a word, all 
self-prompted attention and doing which have for their 
object the pleasure of a new achievement, a new experience. 
Workmanship, therefore, includes practically all experi- 
mentation, manipulation, constructiveness, destructiveness, 
and, on the more purely mental side, playful imagination, 
daydreaming, and curiosity. Curiosity has been well called 
the play of the attention. Much that seems old and easy 
to us is virgin to the child, and a large part of his play has 
a pioneering, exploiting character. Typical expressions of 
workmanship play are the productive and receptive experi- 
mentation with the senses mentioned by Groos, and all ° 
‘forms of manipulation like building with blocks, shoving 
and hustling things about, mussing paper, digging in the 
sand, molding mud, tearing things and knocking them down, 
spontaneous drawing, etc. The list is really interminable. 
When the materials of life cease to be blocks and sand 
piles, when all childish play is outgrown, workmanship 
may still exert its force, giving figurativeness and humor 
to language, little touches of adventure and originality to 
the daily behavior, and now and then true creativeness to 
‘thought and deeds. Workmanship is at the base of all 
adult originality,-and the chief factor of artistic production. * 
Thefe is an element of constructiveness and creativeness in 
all workmanship, while the other distinguishable forms of 
play are reminiscent, rhythmical, or imitative, —the out- 
lets for exuberance or the means of exercise. Workmanship 
clearly corresponds to.that sphere of behavior which Royce
-P-A-G-E-84
  74 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
calls initiative. Veblen speaks of it as “the ubiquitous 
impulse to do the next thing,” —not the same thing, but 
something new. 
It is tempting to exalt workmanship to the plane of a 
creative force in nature. Without it man surely could not 
have risen to his present position, and it is the impulse 
which makes for growth in the individual. The happiness 
and the originality of any person, whether child or adult, 
depend very much upon the full expression of this generic 
play instinct. Artists well fed and well housed, who are 
free to project all that surges within, are of all people the 
most enviable. The great tragedy of school and society is 
the suffocation of the creative instinct of workmanship 
by a formal and thwarting environment. The problem of 
pedagogy and politics is to so reshape life that all the latent 
sprightliness, plasticity, geniality, and creativeness of chil- 
dren and of men and women will come to their fullness. 
One of the chapters of Helen Key’s famous book, “ The 
Century of the Child,” is entitled The Soul Murder ofthe 
Schools. Most of the repressiveness of the workmanship 
instinct which amounts to soul murder comes from a great 
undefinable, uncombatable fog, which will not dissipate 
until there is something like a regeneration and rejuvenation 
of the whole schoolroom atmosphere. Two of the most tan- 
gible enemies of workmanship which can be combated are 
habit and imperfect health. 
Habit has been amply praised, but insufficiently de- 
preciated. However necessary and beneficial, habit is a 
double-edged sword. It makes for mechanism, routine, 
delimitation, archaism. It compels the traveler of life to 
take only familiar, automatic journeys, and puts an end to 
all pioneering and discovery. Habit tends to destroy the 
very plasticity which gave it birth. With the encroachment
-P-A-G-E-85
  
INSTINCT AND RELAXATION 75 
of routine’s prison walls, the deeper, older voices of the 
play spirit fade away, and childhood with its buoyancy be- 
comes something to fondly and sadly gaze back upon; or, 
in the most pathetic cases, habit.becomes such a tyranni- 
cal master of life that the vivacity of youth when seen in 
another is actually painful. 
The other foe of workmanship is undervitality, insuffi- 
cient health. Workmanship has been called a tendency to 
display energy: Plants are sessile organisms, which do not 
bestir themselves; but in the amoeba we find something 
akin to workmanship, — a fund of self-activity which varies 
with the amount of food and rest. With the evolution of 
the nervous system this available fund of energy tends to 
increase. One of the most marked and important traits in 
Peter —to recall our monkey with a mind —is his cease- 
less activity, his tireless experimentation. Before the psycho- 
logical clinie he behaved like an irrepressible, obstreperous 
boy. Primitive man had this same trait, but probably to a 
lower degree than modern man ; for there are good reasons 
for believing that in the race the instinct of workmanship 
has been increasing with those changes in mode of life, like 
the adoption of cooking, which result in the storing up of 
energy beyond the lowest need of existence. One of the 
important factors in the evolution of man undoubtedly has 
been the character of his meals, their frequency, bulk, and 
food values. Workmanship varies with degrees of neural 
nutrition.™ When energy is at a low tide, play does not 
necessarily cease, but tends to express itself along beaten 
and nonproductive lines. The favoring conditions for the 
free spirit of workmanship are good nutrition, rest, and 
the abundant energy of abounding health. The best, most 
wholesome, and creative things of the world burst forth 
from such accumulations of energy. It cannot be otherwise, 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  76 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
for physical health is too closely identified with goodness, 
beauty, and insight. 
V.( Relaxation Reflexes.) Nature has her own lawful limi- 
tations. All life oscillates rhythmically between two poles, 
— activity and rest. Workmanship represents the wave of 
energy at its crest; sleep is the: hollow of the wavé. Relaz- 
ation is as natural, if’ not as instinctive, as activity itself. 
We are accustomed to regard sleep as a kind of “ temporary 
death,” a negative and annulling affair; but Claparéde has 
recently well emphasized its positive aspects. He speaks of 
it as an innate tendency of inhibition, developed by natural 
selection. It is not merely a vegetative function, but a 
definite, positive mode of behavior, biological as well as 
physiological in import. Sleep has, of course, a deeply phys- 
iological, if not chemical, character ; but so has hunger, and 
if we call one instinctive, why not the other? There has 
been no objection to calling hibernation in the lower ani- 
mals instinct. There is also a very biological kind of human 
hibernation which goes on in the province of Pskoy, Russia. 
The poor peasants are said to lie down in their beds with 
a bottle of water and a few loaves. of bread, and to sleep 
and nibble till the coming of spring, when they rise to plow   the softening soil once more. Our ordinary sleep is daily 
hibernation. 
‘leep, therefore, has the following earmarks of instinct : 
oa a fixed, inborn, protective reaction, common to the > 
species, and can be decidedly modified through the influ- 
ence of habit. But whether instinct or not, relaxation is a 
generic form of adaptation not to be ignored in any survey 
of behavior. The positive and compensatory value of rest 
is only now coming to be recognized. Rest is not alone for: 
recuperation ; it is a protective type of adjustment. Our 
natural behavior, has its basis in an intricate interrelated
-P-A-G-E-87
  
INSTINCT AND RELAXATION er 
plexus of instincts. Some reénforce each other, but many 
have an antagonistic value. Thus curiosity may be con- 
sidered an antidote of fear, jealousy of sympathy, and cau- 
tion a counterpoise of competition. Sleep and other forms 
of relaxation, similarly, are compensating and counterbal- 
ancing adaptations to prevent the overexpression or dis- 
integration of the assertive instincts. If anger and all the 
other instinctive responses were evolved through natural 
selection, it is easy to see how sleep grew up in the same 
“manner. A quixotic fund of any instinct would be harmful. 
{Workmanship without sleep would be ruinous) 
Chamberlain has shown that primitive man and men of 
genius naturally, let us say instinctively, alternate periods 
of strenuous exertion with prolonged periods of lounging 
stupidity. It is just as innate to lounge as it is to strive, 
to relax as it is to exert. Inattention is as important and 
developmental as attention, assimilation as necessary as 
impression. Rest is the period of assimilation, and at the 
same time a safeguard against overexertion. The mastery, 
of the fine art of life demands~not only the nourishment 
of instinctive ambition, but the cultivation of rhythmical, 
adequate repose. 
The enlightened teacher will, therefore,_in a systematic 
manner, cultivate relaxation in her punish She will take 
a constructive and not a sensitive attitude toward inatten- 
tion. Much of the school’s inattention is attention to somé- 
thing else, but in young children there are many periods 
of reflex, instinctive brown study, in which the attention 
is diffused, dispersed, — momentary cat naps. These have 
a biological, hygienic import, and ought to be cultivated 
‘ yather than combated. If teachers had absolute sway over 
the attention of children, too many would become priggish 
little adults. The German professor was three-fourths right,
-P-A-G-E-88
  
78 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
who said that the universal inattention of children is a 
natural safeguard against poor pedagogy. Good pedagogy * 
would respect rest as much as activity. There should be 
rest periods as well as busy periods. Nature fills up many 
of the busy periods in the school with a pernicious dawdling 
and pretension of business, or a spreading it thin over a 
long period. If we were really interested in healthful ac- 
tivity, we should. permit sheer idleness for one half of the 
busy period, and put a premium on getting the job honestly 
and vigorously done in the fraction of time left. 
There is a peculiar form of inattention which frequently 
crops out under the discipline of church, school, and supper 
table, — giggling. If we could dignify this unseemly con- 
duct with the terminology of science, we should call it a 
psychophysical relaxation, adaptive in function, superven- 
ing in situations of stress, when the attention processes have 
been unduly tensed! Students describing their own gig- 
gling experiences said that these experiences were especially 
liable to occur in an atmosphere of unnatural seriousness, 
or when tired mentally from protracted attention, or from 
much obedience to commands; when threatened with disci- 
pline, and when physically weary or nervous. Sometimes 
a superabundance of animal spirits favors giggling, but in 
any case it is a symptom of confused, tired, or obstructed 
attention, and is an organic method of relaxation and 
relief. Snickering, of course, is a very primitive form of 
humor, but the highest forms of laughter, and even phil- 
osophical humor, are grounded in a biological function such 
as has been suggested for giggling. A good laugh is a most 
effective form of relief. It removes unnatural tension. It 
breaks the semiparalytic grasp of sulkiness, flushes one’s 
whole mental state, and restores a sense of values. Half- _ 
hysterical laughter and silliness often follow or accompany
-P-A-G-E-89
  INSTINCT AND RELAXATION 79 
prolonged strains, such as sieges, earthquakes, court trials, 
domestic grief, and even continued intellectual effort. Such 
humor surely is the avenue of relief. 
Sometimes the situation is so provokingly funny that 
we roll on the ground with sheer laughter, or we laugh 
until we cry. Indeed, crying and laughter are psychological 
and biological cousins. Crying, like laughing, is a drastic 
mode of relief, and there is universal testimony for its re- 
lJaxing, even balming results. Medical men accordingly 
recommend it as having therapeutic value. 
Crying, like its relative, follows upon @ surcharged con- 
dition of the nerves, or of mental tension, whether in anger, 
‘grief, or joy. Borqvist, in his acute study of the subject, 
reports the case of a person who said, * Often when I am 
tired I have cried over things that when I am well I will 
laugh at.” This confession betrays the close relation between 
the two reactions ; but Borqvist believes that there is this 
important and fundamental difference: “that laughing is 
the accompaniment of movements that promote digestion, 
and that crying is a part of the process which is involved 
in the act of rejection of food.” Hence many of the symp- 
toms of crying —such as the lump in the throat and the 
sobbing spasms of the diaphragm — suggest giving up in a 
digestive as well as a psychic sense. The conclusion is that 
“crying, in its last analysis, is a situation in which there 
has been strong effort and depleted nervous energy. It is 
essentially a breakdown, in the nature of a cessation of 
adaptation to environmental conditions.” But this very 
cessation of adaptation is itself an adaptation. 
Crying, laughter, silliness, whining, giggling, peevishness, 
sulkiness, sullenness, inattention, and obstinacy are all re- 
lated phenomena which ignorant common. sense will often 
treat in an arbitrary and unjust manner. What we need is
-P-A-G-E-90
  80 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
the biological and physician’s insight to interpret them in 
terms of their connection with nature’s inexorable demands 
for relaxation and relief. 
Obstinacy, like crying, is an adaptive cessation of adapta- 
tion. It is, of course, a highly variable complex, but typically 
it is an inhibitory instinct comparable to other forms of pro- 
tective inaction, like the vacant mood, lounging, and even 
sleep. Theodate Smith, who has instructively described the 
psychology of obstinacy, says that the “one symptom invari- 
ably present in all cases appears to be a deficiency of mus- 
cular control, either in the form of cramp or temporary 
paralysis.” This statement strongly implies that obstinacy 
has a positive protective value. 
Why not regard it as an instinctive antidote for docility, 
which is itself instinctive 2 Obstinacy is present in animals 
‘in the form of balkiness, which has its “psychic roots in 
the thwarting of instinctive desires, in physical conditions 
and overfatigue of the nerve centers.” These are the very 
stimuli which produce all forms of inattention, laziness, 
and sleep. Obstinacy, like other instincts, is aggravated by 
humidity and other weather influences. It is characterized 
by rigidity, blankness of expression, inertness, limpness, and 
other symptoms of “a dead-weight type of opposition.” The 
impossibility of coddling or beating obstinacy away and its 
response to the letting-alone treatment eloquently suggest 
its instinctive and remedial character. It is always part of 
a complex; and has a compensatory or counterpoise signifi- 
cance. It is associated with the spirit of independence char- 
acteristic of solitary, self-reliant animals like the donkey ; it 
appears frequently in feeble-minded children who have scant 
power of attention and therefore would be likely to balk 
often ; and again, it is common in children of spirit, boys and 
girls with the rebel in them. Nature always means to keep
-P-A-G-E-91
  
INSTINCT AND RELAXATION 81 
a balance, and the existence of institutional obstinacy is a 
hopeful sign that she has not given even the wards of prisons, 
schools, and asylums a ruinous proportion of docility. 
VI. Work. There is a kind of stubbornness which stands 
for persistence in a purpose or cause, and this kind should 
be sharply differentiated from inhibitory obstinacy. This 
persistency really is an expression of the instinct of work 
rather than of relaxation. Throughout a venerable pre- 
history man was schooled in the lesson of diligence. In 
most primitive times his impulses of workmanship resulted. 
in merely desultory activity, but with the schooling of cen- 
turies this activity became more and more consecutive 
and purposive. Workmanship alone cannot account for 
man’s progress. Upon this instinct was built another which 
may be called the instinct of perseverance, — not only doing 
something, but persisting until the thing is done. 
There can be no doubt that this instinct of perseverance, 
or consecutiveness, has been accumulating; that it was 
much greater at the close of the paleolithic period than dur- 
ing the.eolithic, and that in the metal ages it was stronger 
still. In this instinctive persistence we must look for the 
root of all the heroic labor of man and his patient vigils, of 
all his ambition, strenuousness, and the terrific pace of 
modern life, the sedulousness and the application which the 
schools have been nourishing for centuries. (Workmanship 
and perseverance are to each other like play and work} 
The legion of instincts which we have reviewed repre- 
sent the deepest requirements and tendencies of the race, — 
traits so fundamental that they are transmitted from gener- 
ation to generation, ingrained in the very structure of the 
nervous system. Most of these traits are geologic in their 
venerability. {Childhood play, which involves so many in- 
stincts, is like a processional in which the prehuman and  
-P-A-G-E-92
  82 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
human past reappears with the ripening of successive nerve 
centers] Nothing, therefore, reflects so well as spontaneous 
play the child’s interests, if by that term we mean his own 
requirements and tendencies. The evolution of behavior in 
the race cannot be explained by intellectual progress. All 
development, both in the child and in the race, is grounded 
in instinct. The pedagogical principle based on this_con- 
ception is stated in unequivocal words by Dr. Dewey :E.The 
primary root of all educational activity is in the instine- 
tive, impulsive attitudes of the child, and not_in the presen- 
tation and application of external material.2) The teacher 
who ignores this principle must hear the parable of the 
house built on the sands. 
All happiness and health depend, both in childhood and 
maturity, upon the ‘adequate expression of instincts. There 
is hardly an instiiict which must be absolutely repressed. 
Perfection. and poise are the fruit not of suppression, but of 
a proper harmonizing of all the instincts. The problem of 
pedagogy is to give each instinct the fling it needs in child- 
hood; the problem of the larger hygiene is to strike the 
proper balance between the instincts of activity and relaxa- 
tion. Dr. Burnham has stated the aim of education to be 
the development of habits of healthful activity. /No activity 
can be ideally healthful which does not have a maximum 
efficiency, and it, cannot have this maximum unless it is 
generously offset by leisure. Here curriculums and life 
make their greatest errors. It is high time that the schools 
should appreciate the existence and worth of the benevolent, 
conserving instincts of leisure. To use a Hibernicism, leisure 
must itself be considered a healthful form of activity. Ap- 
plication does not need to be reénforced so much as counter- 
poised. We must learn and teach the art of leisure. Real 
growth and sanity demand relaxation in all its degrees, —
-P-A-G-E-93
  INSTINCT AND RELAXATION 83 
slumber, cat nap, lounge, loaf, and listlessness. It cannot be 
doubted that the hygienic distribution of periods of rest and 
activity would enormously increase the sweetness and pro- 
ductiveness of mankind. Poets have vied with each other 
in their praises of sleep, the “sweet restorer.” Science is 
indorsing their sonnets. Sleep is indeed the “dear mother 
of fresh thought and joyous health.” 
This is the gospel of relaxation, and if it.is biologically 
true, schools should obey it and build upon the instincts 
of relaxation habits of healthful rest.
-P-A-G-E-94
  CHAPTER VII 
THE HAND OF THE RACE AND OF THE CHILD 
About seventy-five years ago, when the Bridgewater 
Treatises were being written to prove the power, wisdom, 
and goodness of God as manifested in creation, Sir Charles 
Bell, in speaking of the human hand, said: “ It presents the 
last and best proof_in the order of creation of that principle 
of adaptation which evinces design. It is the consumma- 
tion of all perfection.” Anaxagoras entertained the opin- 
ion that the superiority of man was owing to his hand, but 
with this view the reverent Sir Charles Bell takes issue. 
“We rather say, with Galen, that man has hands given to 
him because he is the wisest of creatures, than to ascribe 
his superiority and knowledge to the use of his hands.” 
Dr. Robert MacDougall, writing from the modern genetic 
standpoint, says: “. . . of all bodily members the hand is 
the most human and the most noble. In its features and 
capabilities is symbolized all that man has achieved in his 
long upward march from the primeval ooze.” 
sed not even 
  The early worm dwellers in this ooze pos 
the rudiment of a hand, but the primitive fish who descended 
from them in all probability had a pair of fin folds extend- 
ing laterally from head to tail in the form of continuous 
pleats in the skin. These skin folds were the forerunners 
of separate pairs of pectoral and pelvic fins, variously pro- 
vided with cartilaginous rays, horny fibers, and bony rods. 
And these single-jointed paddles in turn were the fore- 
runners of the many-jointed systems of levers of the later 
84   
   
-P-A-G-E-95
THE HAND 85 
quadrupeds. The large fact of descent is admitted, but the 
details of the transformation are not known. “ We do not 
know,” says Wiedersheim in his “ Comparative Anatomy,” 
“how the pentadactyl limb of an air-breathing vertebrate, 
adapted for progression upon land, has been derived from 
the fin only fitted for use in the water, and paleontology 
has so far furnished no solution to this problem.” The 
significant fact is that the fore limbs and hind limbs of all 
vertebrates above the fishes conform to a single ground type. 
The hand of the race is the terminal organ of the fore 
limb. Typically, it consists of a group of wrist and palmar 
bones attached to the radius and ulna, and five digits. 
Eyen in the amphibia the basal plan of the hand is highly 
analogous to that of the human. But the amphibian hand 
is webbed and adapted only to the humblest uses. In the 
reptiles the hand remains limited chiefly to the function of 
locomotion, though in the prehistoric pterosauria the fifth 
finger was elongated and supported a winglike attachment 
for flying. In most snakes the extremities have practically 
vanished. In birds the fore limbs are transformed, but not 
beyond recognition, for the digits and sometimes even the 
claws persist in the wings, as in the archwopteryx and a 
few existing species. 
In mammals the anterior extremity comes to serve al- 
most every possible use. In the whale the digits form the 
frame of a finlike paddle. “Place drawings of the skel- 
eton of the human hand and the fin of a whale side by 
side and ordinary observers will require the printed names 
underneath to distinguish them.” In the bat the digits 
are produced into long supports for a winged membrane 
for flying. In the horse the third digit is specialized into 
a hard, rigid hoof for swift running. The paleontological 
ancestor of the horse, a little plantigrade creature about
-P-A-G-E-96
    86 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
the size of a fox, had a complete set of digits, two of which 
were to disappear, the other two becoming much reduced 
before Quaternary times. Incidentally it is interesting to 
know that the embryo of the horse during its development 
passes through all these phylogenetic stages. In the bur- 
rowing mammals, like the mole, the fore limbs are special- 
ized for digging; in the arboreal mammals, for grasping

and climbing. Even in the climbing marsupials the bones 
of the forearm, which lower in the animal scale are firmly 
connected, become articulated, enabling the rotating moye- 
ments of supination and pronation, so highly developed in 
the human forearm. 
Other modifications which have been pointed out as neces- 
sary for the perfection of the hand are the denudation of 
the hair, the increased sensitiveness of the palms and fingers,
-P-A-G-E-97
THE HAND “BF 
and the elimination of the claw. In the lemurs the claws 
are almost absent, and in the monkeys they have all been 
replaced by nails. 
But the feature of most decisive significance in the ana- 
tomical evolution of the hand is muscular. The most primi- 
tive racial hand was capable of nothing more than simple, 
simultaneous, oscillatory movements, and the only muscles 
were elevators and depressors. Ascending the scale, these 
muscles become more and more differentiated and compli- 
cated ; protractors, retractors, flexors, extensors, rotators, 
supinators, pronators, abductors, and adductors appear to 
enlarge the repertoire of movement. The human hand is 
now equipped with over two dozen beautifully adapted mus- 
cles. There has been, of course, a corresponding growth in 
nerve supply, with the addition of higher accessory nerve 
centers to the ancient fundamental ones. Innumerable 
nerve filaments now bind the hand to the brain. 
We have already seen, in the chapter on the biological 
perspective, something of the significance of the muscular 
system. The nervous system is, after all, only a part of a 
larger unit, the neuromuscular system; and its develop- 
ment from the sea anemone, through worm, fish, reptile, and 
mammal, is interlinked with the multiplication and perfec- 
tion of muscles.( The peripheral organs of sense and of 
movement are primary, and the development of the central 
neural masses like the brain is sympathetic with that of the 
periphery. It is this large fact which gives the hand its 
vital influence upon the development of both the race and 
the individual. MacDougall has gone so far as to say that 
“the specialization of the hand was the single indispen- 
sable condition, so far as regards gross anatomical features, 
which determined the widely divergent subsequent fortunes 
of the monkey tribe and man-ape respectively.”

88 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
A few years ago when the great Italian scientist Angelo 
Mosso came to this country, he delivered a very sugges- 
tive address on the relationship between psychic processes 
and muscular exercise. ‘‘ The mutual relation of intelligence 
and movement,” he said, “is one of the most constant factors 
in nature.” The superiority of the Greeks, he thought, was 
due to their great attention to bodily exercise. Similarly, 
the genius of the great artists in the renaissance was de- 
veloped by the exercise with which they gained their 
manual dexterity. Giotto was painter, sculptor, and archi- 
tect; Michelangelo was anatomist, painter, sculptor; and 
Leonardo da Vinci, the champion ambidexter of the world, 
was musician, painter, engineer, architect, man of letters, 
sculptor, etc. “‘ The more mobile the extremities of an ani- 
mal are,” says Mosso, “ the more intelligent it is.)/Among 
all birds the parrot is the most intelligent because it makes” 
more use than do other birds of its legs, beak, and tongue ; 
the elephant is more intelligent than all other wild animals 
because he makes use not only of his legs, but also of his 
snout as organs of movement.” What the trunk is to the 
elephant the hand is to man. ° 
Dr. Burke, in his oft-quoted article on the development 
of the nervous system, said, ““ When we attempt to measure 
the gap between man and the lower animals in terms of 
power of movement, the wonder is no less great than when 
we use terms of mentality.” Imagine the state of a crea- 
ture in whom the hand is perpetually degraded to the office 
of locomotion. Such is the state of all hoofed animals and 
largely of rodents, insectivora, and carnivora. Even in the 
clutching, tearing, burrowing, and digging of the latter 
animals, as Burke pointed out, the real work is done by 
the more central muscles. The accompanying diagram of 
the hand of the mole, though it may imply sad havoc to the
-P-A-G-E-99
THE HAND 89 
lawn, does not suggest a range of movement or motility large 
enough to place the animal high in the mental scale. 
It is not until we reach the arboreal mammals that clumsy 
hoofs and paddy paws give way to flexible digits which 
approach the human hand in both appearance and function.

Of course even here there are exceptions, such as the sloth. 
This uninspiring creature has hands and feet which are like 
double and triple hooks. With these he fixes himself to 
a bough, his chief hope of defense the livelong day being 
his resemblance to a motionless tuft of hanging moss. “ A 
hungry bear collects a family of sloths as he would gather 
a bunch of grapes.” But the typical tenant of the trees is 
 
-P-A-G-E-100
  90 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
a creature who is all hands, even to his feet and tail. For 
example, take the American opossum: he grasps the limbs 
with considerable dexterity, and with his prehensile tail or 
fifth hand he will even roll up a large bundle of leaves and 
carry them to his hole. The cleverness of the raccoon in 
the manipulation of his handlike claws also is characteristic 
and bespeaks a high degree of intelligence, such as Davis 
has found in his interesting study of that animal’s behavior. 
The most important differentiation which takes place with 
the arboreal needs of climbing, clinging, and grasping mate- 
rials for food and home building is the greater mobility of 
the first digit. Even in the marsupials the great toe acquires 
the power of opposition to the other toes. In some species 
this power of opposition is limited to the foot, but with the 
apes it extends to the thumb. Man has lost his power of op- 
posing the toe, but boasts the highest development of thumb 
opposition,/1 It was when the arboreal life was supplemented 
by terrestrial habits, and when our primitive progenitors 
began to walk erect, that the hand was freed for a multi- 
tude of new uses, and experienced a new burst of develop- 
ment, linked with the largest destinies of the race; for the 
hands became the servants, the antenne, of the brain, and 
in a very real sense the creators of new areas in the brain, 
In every important anatomical feature the hand was per- 
fected with the higher uses to which it was impelled. It 
became softer, more slender, supple, and sensitive. The are 
of rotation of the forearm became greater, so that now it is 
about one hundred eighty degrees. The wrist hinges be- 
came more flexible, and MacDougall thinks there has been 
an increasing relaxation of the system of muscles which bind 
the hand together. The thumb has become more independ- 
ent and powerful, so that now it can grasp a sphere where 
once it could only grasp a cylinder, or still earlier moved
-P-A-G-E-101
  
THE HAND 91 
parallel with the other digits. Each digit has gained a sim- 
ilar independence, both in flexion and in lateral and oblique 
extension, permitting now the most marvelous manipula- 
tions of instruments both of art and of utility. 
The investigations of Feré seem to prove that there has 
been an increase in the length of the last joint of all the 
fingers. /Undoubtedly there has been increase of sensitivity. 
The hairs and callous pads have been supplanted by a soft 
mosaic of tiny sensorial areas, so that now the most delicate 
contacts and minute distances between single contacts can 
be discriminated. In the palm of each hand there are some 
six hundred Pacinian corpuscles and fifteen thousand Meiss- 
ner corpuscles, — microscopic spongy bulbs the chief organs 
of touch. There are thousands more in the fingers, which 
are. fourfold more sensitive than the palms. 
(Phere is one other way in which the hands of the race 
were specialized, or perverted as the ambidexters would say. 
We know not when, but probably as far back as the eolithic 
age, the human species began to favor one hand, and there is 
some evidence from the paleolithic drawings that it was 
from the first the right hand. It is natural that such a 
specialization should have developed, for it is nature’s way 
of increasing perfection. Davis states a fact about the 
raccoon which suggests the possibility of even prehuman 
unidextrality: ‘“ Through practice the animals soon acquire 
the ability to use each forepaw independently, and are finally 
able to use one paw with greater quickness and accuracy 
than they formerly used the two.” <A natural evolutionary 
step following upon this would seem to be the particular 
perfection of one hand. 
‘What is the origin of right-handedness? There are all 
sorts of ingenious theories : (1) It is the result of the way 
the mother carries the child, giving the right hand the 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
  92 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
larger chance for development. (2) Primitive man shielded 
his heart, which is on the left side-of the body, with his 
left hand, and fought with his strong right arm; tradition 
and education have emphasized the distinction. (3) The vis- 
cera on the right side of the body weigh one pound more 
than those on the left, the center of gravity is on the right 
side, and the kind of respiration which accompanies exercise 
of the limbs on the right is more favorable to sustained 
exertion than vice versa. The reason for right-handedness, 
then, is a mechanical one. (4) The directness of the com- 
munication of the carotid artery with the aorta and the 
larger caliber of the left carotid give the left hemisphere, 
which controls the right hand, a nutritional and therefore 
functional advantage. (5) Unidextrality is the result of 
ocular one-sidedness, which preéxisted and made necessary 
the paramount use of one or the other hand. (6) Right- 
handedness is a character which has been attained in the 
ordinary course of the evolution of man by the process of 
natural. selection. Left-brainedness is as much the cause 
as the result of right-handedness. 
It is unnecessary and impossible for us to go into a criti- 
cal discussion of these theories. Jackson in his work on 
ambidexterity minimizes them. The most tenable general 
conclusion seems to be that right-handedness is a racial 
hereditary tendency, correlated with a structural and func- 
tional preéminence of the left hemisphere. It has an organic 
basis, not necessarily in the gross weight of the left hemi- 
sphere, but in the innate predisposition and organization 
of the cortical neurons of that hemisphere. With most 
people, therefore, right-handedness is truly instinctive, de-_ 
pending upon inborn peculiarities of the racial brain. Left- 
handedness, whether atavistic, pathologic, or sporadic in 
origin, tends likewise to be hereditary.
-P-A-G-E-103
THE HAND 93 
Summarizing the chief stages in the evolution of the racial 
hand we find the following: (1) differentiation of the digits 
from a simple, single-jointed lever; (2) multiplication and 
segmentation of muscles and nerves, accompanied by the 
addition of accessory powers of grasping and manipula- 
tion grafted upon the fundamental powers of locomotion ; 
(3) complete abandonment of hand locomotion with the 
assumption of the erect attitude; (4) opposition of the 
thumb; (5) right-handedness ; (6) development of crafts 
and fine arts, mechanical and technical skill. 
It will be interesting to see whether the development of 
the hand in the individual child reproduces these chief 
phyletic phases. 
The earliest and most striking hand feat exhibited in 
infancy was demonstrated by Dr. Robinson in his experi- 
ments with Darwinism in the nursery. He found that even 
a newborn baby can grasp a bar or a finger, and suspend 
its weight from ten seconds to a minute. When the baby is 
two or three weeks old, it will remain hanging for as much 
as two minutes without any sign of strain. This marvelous 
reaction, which would tax even an adult, and which so con- 
trasts with the infant’s general helplessness, can only be 
explained on evolutionary grounds. 
For months the hand movements are always simultaneous. 
The child cannot do different things at the same time with 
each hand. Many of these early finger and arm movements 
have a rhythmic, oscillatory character which to some ob- 
servers is suggestive of the aquatic stage of race develop- 
ment. With the advent of creeping and climbing the hands 
return to their ancient function of locomotion and grasping. 
As we should expect, the fingers for a long time move par- 
allel with each other. Any one who will watch carefully 
the manipulations of a three-year-old child will find that
-P-A-G-E-104
94 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
the power of independent flexion and extension of the digits 
is still considerably undeveloped, and that the tendency to 
use the fingers together in a single hook form persists. 
The power of opposition in the phylum, as we saw, first 
appeared in the hind limbs; and the big toe of babies is 
  
  Fic. 18. Tue Ferr as Hanns 
In infancy the foot exhibits some of its racial prehensile power 
strangely mobile, as are the little toes, which can grasp 
with a vigor reminiscent of their ancient prehensile char- 
acter. The accompanying photograph shows the instinc- 
tive skill of a seven-months-old baby in “handling” objects 
with the feet. The independence of the thumb asserts itself 
slowly. As Burke says, “For the first few months of life the 
thumb is really a nuisance to the child and is continually in
-P-A-G-E-105
THE HAND 95 
the way.” After it has come out of its curled-up position 
in the grasp it takes over a half year or more before the 
method of opposition is well established. All the fingers 
move parallel and the palm faces downward. The invalid 
in extreme weakness reverts to a racially old method of pre- 
hension and grasps with all the fingers moving parallel and 
the palm facing downward. The normal developed grasp is 
of course with the palm upward and the thumb opposed. 
Simultaneity is a characteristic of the early hand move- 
ments. Even the adult does not overcome completely this 
tendency of the hands to act in unison. Idiots never over- 
come it, and when one hand moves, the other must move 
sympathetically. But in every normal child this bilateral 
simultaneity begins to break up at about the eighth month, 
when there is a propensity to use one hand more than the 
other. We have seen a baby in arms show very convincing 
evidence of this. We held her so she could strike a Chinese 
gong which hung from the ceiling. She did it with amus- 
ingly earnest pleasure. Repeatedly we put the little ham- 
mer with which she struck into her left hand. She would 
make a few efforts with that hand, and then, without fail, 
quickly transfer the hammer to her right hand, which even 
at her tender age she used with decidedly greater facility 
and effect. In Professor Baldwin’s child a preference for 
the right hand began to manifest itself as early as the 
sixth month. 
This unidextrality does not appear with equal intensity 
and at the same age with all children, nor does it develop 
at a uniform rate. In fact it may be —if we knew all the 
facts on this puzzling subject — that ambidextrous training 
should have a relatively larger place in early childhood, as 
it did in the earlier experience of the race. In most cases 
such training would have a favorable effect on symmetry
-P-A-G-E-106
  96 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
of posture, would make for balance of movement, and 
relieve muscle and eyestrain. Besides, the power of the 
right hand would itself be improved by the exercise of the 
left. There is a kind of cross-education, as experiments in 
the laboratory have proved. It was shown with the mer- 
cury dynamometer that the unpracticed left hand gained in 
nine days about 50 per cent in strength of grip through 
practice of the right hand. It was also demonstrated in cer- 
tain tapping tests that the unearned increment extended not 
only from hand to hand, but to various parts of the body, 
from hand to foot. The ease with which the left hand does 
mirror writing also suggests the fact of cross-education. 
Christopher found, in his investigation of the Chicago 
public-school children, that a marked difference in the 
strength of the two hands does not appear in boys till after 
he fourteenth year, nor in girls till after the thirteenth. 
The disparity between the left and the right hand seems 
to be greater as a rule in bright children. If this is a law, 
it is one which the extreme ambidexter must respect; but 
here is still a place for a moderate ambidexterity which 
will favor the specialization of one hand, but will not deny 
it the advantages that come crosswise from education of 
he other, nor deny the whole body the benefits that come 
rom bilateral control. 
Right-handedness and speech bear both genetic and neu- 
rological relations to each other. Primitive language was 
that of the hand, and it is probable that the right hand was 
reéminent in gesturing. The neurons that control this 
hand are in the left hemisphere, and the many hand-motor 
associations which the perceptions and images of things   awaken are predominantly represented in that hemisphere. 
When articulate speech arose, the delicate neuron organ- 
izations which govern it, both on the sensory and the motor
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE HAND 97 
side, naturally located themselves in the left hemisphere, 
and the highly complex art of writing words also probably 
has a special center there. In left-handed people these 
speech centers are in the right hemisphere. 
That there is some sympathy and connection between 
the hand-motor areas and the speech areas is suggested by 
the fact that right-handedness and articulate speech occur 
at about the same time in little children. Sikorski, the au- 
thority on speech defects, found, after examining ten thou- 
sand pupils, that the proportion of left-handed writers is 
almost twice as great for boys as for girls. He also found 
by comparing the copy books of boys and girls that ataxic 
writing was from seven to eight times more prevalent with 
the former. He correlated these facts with the well-known 
truth that boys are about three times more susceptible to 
speech defects than girls. This is a neural susceptibility that 
may extend to the writing center, which seems to stand in 
close relation to that of speech. When marked left-handed- 
ness shows itself, the neural center of gravity apparently 
is in the right hemisphere, and systematic interference 
with left-handedness therefore works against the designs 
of nature, and may so disturb the neural equilibrium that 
speech defects will ensue. The fact that left-handedness is 
so often hereditary is itself significant. The suffering and 
harm, both mental and physical, which are being visited 
upon constitutionally left-handed children ought to come 
to an end. 
The law of evolution in the hand of the individual seems, 
therefore, to be like that of the race, a gradual progression 
from simultaneity to independence of movement, —a law 
which applies first to the whole hand, and then to the 
separate digits, and later to the separate joints. Manual 
dexterity consists primarily in ability to execute distinct
-P-A-G-E-108
  98 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
little movements, and only secondarily in the coérdination 
of these. At first the baby cannot even put his hand to 
his mouth, and when he does attain to this power, one hand 
tends to move sympathetically with the other. Later, this 
same child may make literally hundreds of simultaneous, 
but different, digital movements with both hands. A trained 
person can, according to figures quoted by Jackson, play on 
the piano 5,595 notes in four minutes and three seconds. 
  Fig. 19. Baby anp Aputr Hanps 
To get an adequate appreciation of the almost consum- 
mate perfection of the human hand, one has but to compare 
it with some of its ancestral forms and capacities in the 
lower animals, in infants, or in defectives in whom it has 
suffered arrested development. The accompanying picture 
illustrates, as beautifully as a nonkinetoscopie picture 
can, the salient differences between the controlled, coér- 
dinated adult hand and the undeveloped, half-anthropoid 
hand of the infant. See the tendency in the baby hands and 
arms, to say nothing about the feet and legs, to move all 
together. If the stockings were only off, we should see 
 
-P-A-G-E-109
  
THE HAND 99 
evidences of simultaneous flexion of toes as well as of 
fingers. Notice the padded, unrelaxed character of the 
baby hand, and how closely the fingers act and lie together. 
Contrast with this the separate control, in both flexion and 
extension, of the individual digits, typical of the adult’s 
hand, when it is normally 
developed. 
The significance of the 
perfected human hand is 
still more forcibly brought 
out by a comparison with 
the idiot hand which was so 
well described by Séguin 
in his classic essay: “The 
hand of R is small, the 
nails short and brittle, fin- 
gers as if unfinished, no 
power, no skill, only auto- 
matic movements mainly 
from the wrist. He could 
  not put his fingers in any 
given attitude. He could 
not rotate on command 
that wrist so nimble when 
  striking or vibrating auto- 
Fig. 20. Toe Hanns anp Hanpwork 
or aN Imprcite Boy matically. He could obey 
the movements of eleva- 
tion and abduction, but not always, nor with anything 
like precision.” 
Grasp this hand and the very feeling of it is at first 
uncanny because of the clammy skin, the unyielding, un- 
responsive fingers. Some of the most fruitful tests deter- 
mining mental efficiency are those which demand the use
-P-A-G-E-110
  
100 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
of the hands in a controlled manner, as threading needles, 
tracing lines, striking dots with a small pointed wand, 
stringing beads, etc. Simple activities —such as button- 
ing and unbuttoning, tying shoe strings, serubbing, peeling 
potatoes — often constitute the highest attainments of the 
idiot hand, even under education. One of the tests to which 
these children 
—for so they al- 
ways are, evel 
though they may 
live into mature 
are sub-   
age 
jected in the 
Home for the 
Feeble-minded at 
Vineland, New 
Jersey, is called 
the stereognos- 
tic test. The 
subject puts his 
hands into an 
inclosed bag to 
see whether he 
can by stereog- 
  nosis — that is, Fic. 21. SrerroGnosis 
by feeling the 
objects in the bag — distinguish between the ball, brush, 
comb, key, ete. : 
It was by training the idiot hand that Séguin awakened 
the idiot mind. The hand, as we shall show in the follow- 
ing chapter, is truly an organ of perception. With its flexi- 
ble motor equipment it explores surfaces and outlines, and 
through its thousands of microscopic touch corpuscles,
-P-A-G-E-111
  
    
ca 
  
101
-P-A-G-E-112
  102 ' THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
cutaneous and articular, it helps to frame a figured con- 
sciousness of the size, form, rondure, edges, etc., of things. 
At the end of the index finger there are twenty-one Meissner 
corpuscles to one square millimeter. The finger tip can dis- 
tinguish separate vibrations, even though they impinge at 
the rate of 1552 per second, can discern a minimal distance 
of one tenth of a millimeter, and a weight of three grams 
to a square millimeter. Furthermore, the internal sensory 
mechanism of the hand is so delicate that if the hand be 
moved through the tiniest fraction of an arc, the movement 
will nevertheless be felt. Contrast all these powers with 
those of the brute paw! 
But these refined sensory qualities are not to be consid- 
ered as divorced from the incomparable motor mechanism, 
of the hand. It is the motility of the hand, joined with its 
intrinsic sensitiveness, that makes it the supreme organ of 
perception. The rods and cones of the retina are not stere- 
ognostic. As MacDougall says, “The world becomes real 
to us only in so far as we are active in relation to it.” 
Creatures with clumsy and callous limbs cannot get the 
varied tactual contact with the configuration of objects 
upon which clear perception depends. The exploring hand 
furnishes not only the passive tactual experiences, but 
the vivid, orderly kinzesthetic sensations which make it “a 
second visual sense by which the pathway of visual per- 
ception is illuminated.” If teachers were only more pro- 
foundly convinced of the psychology of all this, they would 
not so exclusively address the eye and the ear. 
It seems to us that teachers should become more con- 
scious of the hands of their pupils. When the whole boy 
comes to school, he brings his hands with him, and though 
they may sometimes be dirty, that is not their most vital 
characteristic. We know one teacher who does appreciate 
 
-P-A-G-E-113
THE HAND 103 
hands. She often takes pupils by the hand; she judges their 
temperament by the clasp, and when she wishes to under- 
stand their passing mood, she feels the hand. By this “digi- 
tal diagnosis” she learns more than she can in any other 
way. In fact, she has a half-conscious pedagogical palmis- 
try which enables her to distinguish mischievous, sluggish, 
and nervous children by their hands. If she hesitates for a 
pupil’s name, she looks at his hands and promptly the name 
comes back to her, so much individuality has the hand ; and 
when she tries to recall a past schoolroom, an assemblage, 
not of faces but of hands, troops before her mind’s eye. 
Hands and face, — these are the two unclothed, unmasked 
parts of our physical personality through which character 
speaks. And Helen Keller writes: “ Not only is the hand 
as easy to recognize as the face, but it reveals its secrets 
more openly and unconsciously. People control their coun- 
tenances, but the hand is under no such restraint. It relaxes 
and becomes listless when the spirit is low and dejected ; the 
muscles tighten when the mind is excited or the heart glad, 
and permanent qualities stand written on it all the time.” 
These qualities, both permanent and passing, deserve 
the teacher’s attention. It is not a question of linear astro- 
logical palmistry, but of a recognition of the larger expres- 
siveness of the hand. Dr. Warner, after examining some 
thousands of subjects, men, women, and children, found 
that “the different postures of the hand could be accepted 
as expressions of certain conditions of the individual, as 
physical signs or objective observable expressions inherent 
at the time.” Thus there is the normal straight hand which 
is extended in a poised, balanced manner typical of strength. 
The nervous hand tends to bend, and the feeble hand to 
droop. This extension of the hand is a very good test of 
the child’s general control and vitality.
-P-A-G-E-114
    104 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
The teacher cannot go into the manicure business, nor 
will she try to make dandies, but the ideal of a clean, well- 
kept, healthy hand ought at least to be in mind. She should 
recognize the existence of unhygienic dirt. A physician, in 
a recent article, has gone so far as to assert that “the chief 
unintentional crime of our age, if we can call that which 
is unconscious and unintentional a crime, is dirty hands. 
Less than a century ago the medical profession had to face 
this condition in a serious form.” 
Surely the teacher should be interested enough in finger 
“nails to detect the many cases of nail biting which are very 
numerous with girls at a critical physiological age. This 
habit often is a symptom of something larger than a little 
nervousness. But even so the hand is too precious to be 
disfigured by onychophagy. 
There is another form of abuse to the hand whose un- 
pleasantness we cannot cover with a scientific name, but 
the existence of which is likely to annoy teacher and parent. 
This is the perversity of sucking the thumb. It crops out 
in most unexpected places, often is a fetish for inducing 
sleep, and sometimes the very structure and flaccid appear- 
ance of the thumb betray its excessive indulgence. The 
palate may even be so deformed as to cause a lisp in speech. 
In many cases no amount of persuasion, bribe, or punish- 
ment is of avail. Even bitter aloes and asafetida applied 
to the thumb do not deter, and we know of one case which 
did not respond to treatment until an old-fashioned country 
doctor tied the arm to a shingle splint under the garment 
in such a way that it could not be flexed, and the thumb 
simply could not be brought to the mouth. 
Is not the hand worthy of a little more conscious appre- 
ciation and respect ? We fold the hands of death tenderly, 
and they affect us with a strange power, for when lifeless

they suddenly suggest so much that we never thought of 
while they were living and acting; for those hands sym- 
bolize all the deeds and misdeeds of a life. One of the 
most impressive objects in the National Museum at Wash- 
ington is a bronze cast of the strong and tender hand of 
Abraham Lincoln. 
How the hands of people differ, reflecting all the fortunes 
of life, —the hands of the toiler made horny by the physi- 
cal struggle for existence; the supple, self-expressive hands 
of the artist; the worn, disfigured hands of the machine 
tender; the tireless hands of the mother who does every- 
thing; and the characterless hands “that spin not and toil 
not, and yet are not beautiful. Beneath their soft, smooth 
roundness what a chaos of undeveloped character!” High- 
est of all ranks the hand which embodies fully the qualities 
both of science and of humanitarianism, —“ merciful gen- 
tleness and splendid certainty.” 
The Scriptures have touched the hands with idealism. 
Weare told that we must have both a pure heart and clean 
hands. If the teacher feels something of this idealism, she 
will be able to impart it to the child. It is worth while 
to make a boy really feel the sentiment of honor toward 
his hands.

  CHAPTER VIII 
TOUCH AND THE APPRECIATION OF THINGS 
. “ Life is response to the order of nature.” The measure 
of life, we might almost say, is sensitiveness to nature. 
The ancient psalmist has majestically catalogued nature’s 
contents, — the heavens, the earth, and the great wide sea 
wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and 
great beasts; the chariot clouds, the wings of the wind, 
the springs of the valley, the fowls of the firmament, the 
voice of the thunder, the grass for the cattle, the cedars 
of Lebanon. 
The scientist, in language more prosaic but still poeti-   
cally suggestive, describes nature in terms of the inces- 
sant forces of gravity, atoms, electrons, and tenuous waves 
of ether dancing through space at the rate of hundreds of 
billions per second. Our sense perceptions are the feelings 
which correspond to these varied objects and energies in 
nature, “ whose radiant activity enfolds us all.” 
The whole body of the ameeba is sensitive to contact, 
mechanical jars, light, heat, chemical and electrical stimuli. 
In creatures as humble as the hydra and the sea anemone 
there are special sensory nerve cells placed between the 
environment and the responding muscles of the organism. 
These sense cells are triggerlike devices which furnish the 
cue for responses and make them more prompt, certain, 
and varied. In the jellyfish there are special sense organs, 
eight clusters of them around the rim, for the light, chemi- 
cal, and pressure senses. If these sense bodies are removed,

the animal will no longer pulsate spontaneously, — which 
goes to prove the fundamental importance of sensation. 
Genetically, the sense organs preceded the development of 
the brain. 
The sensory-motor elements of the nervous system are 
the most primitive, both in function and structure ; but very 
early in the animal scale the locomotor system becomes 
sufficiently complex to require a central “ adjustor.” The 
natural place for this adjustor is in the head, the part that 
is foremost in all crawling, climbing, fleeing, and fighting. 
Thus even the earthworm carries a brain in his head. 
The general character of any brain varies with the sen- 
sory equipment and the environment of the animal. Take 
the turtle: he lives in a world of odors; scent is all 
important in his life economy ; his brain consists chiefly of 
two big, bulging olfactory lobes. In man, smell is “a fallen 
angel”; the olfactory lobes have dwindled to the size of a 
bean, and the bulge of our brain has a different reason, — 
though possibly not a different origin, for Meynert has sug- 
gested that our cerebral cortex has its genesis in the olfac- 
tory lobes. In any case the organization and development 
of our- cortex are indissolubly connected with the use of 
our sensory apparatus. It is the central switchboard, or 
adjustor, on which every sensitive point of our body is 
represented. The cortex is not only a sensorium, but it is 
so fundamentally a sensorium that its vigor and refinement 
depend primarily upon the sense impressions which have 
modified its structure. The degree in which our minds will 
be athletic and esthetic depends upon what we have seen, 
heard, smelled, tasted, and touched. 
The oldest, biggest, and most fundamental end organ we 
have is our sensitive skin, —1,584,300 square millimeters in 
extent. Woods Hutchinson has called the human skin one
-P-A-G-E-118
  108 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
of the wonders of the world,—‘‘a tissue more beautiful than 
velvet, more pliable than silk, more durable under exposure 
than steel.” Havelock Ellis describes it as “ the archeologi- 
cal field of human and prehuman experience, the foundation 
upon which all forms of sensory perception have grown up.” 
Indefatigable explorers like Weber, Frey, and Goldscheider 
have devoted a good part of their lives to the investiga- 
tion of this archeological field. They have used the most 
ingenious and refined methods of experimental science for 
the discovery and mapping out of its many wonders. 
The ameeba has no skin, but it is altogether possible that 
even in the ameeba the peripheral protoplasm, or the part 
nearest to the environment, is especially sensitive to stimuli. 
If the amoeba has a stream of consciousness, it may well 
be because of some rudimentary contact-awareness, which 
Spencer considers the most primitive psychic phenomenon. 
Certain it is that almost as soon as nature begins to multi- 
ply and differentiate the cells in a single organism the ecto- 
derm becomes especially sensitive to contact and pressure. 
Thus even in the skin of the hydra and sea anemone and 
in the outer covering of earthworm, frog, and lizard are 
scattered many sense cells. Ages and ages before man 
appeared upon the face of the earth there were “multifari- 
ous experiences with hardness.” Hall enumerates in a sug- 
gestive way how “bottom creatures love crevices, develop 
responses to points, curves, compression, changes of per- 
meability, cohesion, thickening, squeezing into holes, cracks, 
hugging against each other.” In mammals, hairs become 
the instruments of touch. In the little trembling mouse, 
with its delicate fur of multitudinous sensitive hairs, general 
tactility is raised to a very high power. 
Man, although he has lost much of his ancestral hair 
covering, is provided with hundreds of thousands of touch

organs, —more, indeed, than seem necessary, as though 
nature had provided a reserve for the future development 
of his sensibility. Our whole cutaneous and subcutaneous 
tissue-and mucous membrane are equipped with pressure 
cells, bulbs, and corpuscles, of various shapes and uses. 
Over a million delicate nerve fibers lead from these sensitive 
points to the spinal cord, and every pressure point associated 
with over a half million hairs gives a sensation qualitatively 
distinct. Besides this the extensive linings of our viscera 
are supplied with various tactile organs, and it may be that 
our very organic sensations which arise on internal stimu- 
lation are only special varieties and combinations of tactile 
impressions. Furthermore, there are extremely important 
pressure or touch end organs within the voluntary muscles 
themselves, and in the sensitive joint surfaces on which 
these muscles operate, and in the tendons to which they 
attach. The stimulation of this group of organs produces 
our tactile-motor or kinesthetic sensations, which make us 
aware of all our movements of the fingers, arms, tongue, 
etc. Closely identified are the sensations of strain occa- 
sioned by muscular activity in overcoming resistance ; and 
when the muscular activity is cadenced, we have the sense 
of rhythm. Thus our whole physical organism from finger 
tips to tendons and vitals is literally possessed by a myriad ‘J 
of tactile neurons. No other sense has such a wide domain. “ 
No other sense lies at once so all-pervadingly close to our 
personality and to our realization of the objective world. 
Tactility is the very essence of reality. 
Consciousness of the outside world, and of the bodily 
self, begins with the vague tactile impressions of mouth, 
cheek, and body enjoyed by the baby when nestled in its 
mother’s arms. In the early weeks the child is merely a 
passive receptor of tactile stimuli, and his attention does 4
-P-A-G-E-120
    110 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
not rise above the plane of staring and wonder. But his 
nervous system, developing at a rapid pace, prompts him 
and enables him in due time to be actively curious and to 
accumulate tactile experience on his own initiative. This 
is active attention and active touch. He begins to reach, 
to clasp, to creep, to walk, to tear, to build up. He gets 
into mischief and into a knowledge of things, and chiefly 
through the ceaseless manipulation of his prehensile organs, 
the hands. These are really end organs of perception of su- 
preme importance. Nothing in the long onward march of 
the human species was more helpful and potential than the 
releasing of these organs from the brutal use of locomotion 
for manual dexterity and contrivance. Indeed, the contact 
experiences resulting from manipulation constitute the very 
“core of thinghood.” ‘The lower animals, in their manipu- 
lation, are limited to such clumsy organs as beaks, paws, 
claws, and jaws, and Professor Mead has raised the question 
whether the capacity of clear perception of physical things 
is therefore not limited to man. 
J When compared with sight and hearing, touch has been 
called an unintellectual sense, but such a statement is seri- 
ously misleading. The most fundamental data for our per- 
ception of distance, direction, size, and form come through 
the feel gate. Only handling and manual activity can put 
vividness and content into the perceptions of the outside 
world. The child must begin in very infancy its acquaint- 
ance with the resistance and construction qualities of paper, 
sand, cloth, wood, etc. By gradual stages he gets farther 
and farther into the heart of things, and learns the essen- 
  tials of what engineers call the materials of construction. 
If his opportunities are good, he will by tools learn the 
individuality of various woods, cardboard, leather, wire, 
fibers, clay, glass, stone, wool, cotton, and by dabbling

acquire enough about every art to give him an appreciative 
apperception for everything that man has made. Our point 
is that he cannot get this appreciation by mere reading or 
listening or even observation. His skin and tendons and 
muscles must be stimulated before he gets the kernel of 
reality in any physical thing. For this reason much of the 
object teaching in the schools is not nearly so effective as is 
often fondly believed. It is only eye-deep, and what children 
need is the opportunity to handle and stroke. A picture is 
better than a word, a stuffed bird better than a picture of 
one, but nothing can take the place of putting a little live 
creature into the palms, where fifty thousand touch bulbs 
will tingle with the fluffiness of the feathers. Such a contact 
experience will establish a warm, tactile sympathy for the 
object, beside which a mere visual impression, however defi- 
nite, is feeble and anesthetic. The do-not-touch principle, at 
school, home, and expositions, is unfortunately limiting. 
\V There is a whole group of biological reasons why touch 
is of all the senses the most fundamental, not only for 
the development of intellectual perception but also for the 
growth of our esthetic, emotional naturg. .Touch is chron- 
ologically first in the history of mind.\/ With the possible 
exception of hunger, it is the most ancient of all experiences. 
There were touch sensations in the primordial sea where 
the earliest life began. There were touch sensations in the 
mud and on the land billions of years before the continents 
took their present shape and before man appeared upon 
the face of these continents. Touch is most intimately asso- 
ciated with the fundamental instincts of workmanship, 
hunger, sex, curiosity, fighting, and sympathy. Moreover, 
it is most vague, diffuse, and general in character. All these 
reasons combine to make it the most profoundly and mas- 
sively emotional of all the senses, especially in childhood, 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  112 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
when its ancestral values tend once more to emerge from 
the deep levels of the nervous system. 
Harriet Martineau, in her autobiography, recalls how in 
childhood the touch of a velvet button affected her: ‘ The 
rapture of the sensation was really monstrous.” A little 
child may stroke a soft blanket with a delight so intense, 
and yet so reverent and tender, as to be almost spiritual. 
Through no other avenue does the child get such a wealth of 
artistic enjoyment. Who can number the thrills of pleasure 
every eager child gains by the mere stroking of smooth 
surfaces and rondures, polished woods and marbles, pebbles, 
silks, vegetables, fruits, animals? And what of the end- 
less rapturous experiments with the textures, the pliancy, 
elasticity, and rigidity of all sorts of materials ? 
Then there are the larger dermal joys and adventures in 
which face and cheek, and sometimes the whole body, par- 
ticipate, — the big tactual experiences with the elements, 
fire, frost, cold, wind, mist, sod, beach, and sea. These massy 
experiences, though less discriminative than the delicate 
touches of the finger tips, are all the more bucolic and ex- 
uberant, for they are profoundly dyed with the interests, 
joys, and longings of the race; and there is a resurgence 
of feeling when the child reéxperiences them. Hence his 
orgy of enjoyment when he is free to wade, wallow, and 
splash in mud or water. Bareheadedness, barefootedness — 
and on swimming and athletic days barebodiedness — are 
the biological rights of every child. Only by such generous 
exposure to wind and weather, to earth, water, and sky, 
can nature make those rich, massive impressions which get 
to the depth of the soul. Every child needs a rich range 
of touch experiences, — of the delicate for the apprecia- 
tion of things refined, of the grosser for the appreciation of 
things strong, stately, and sublime.
-P-A-G-E-123
TOUCH AND APPRECIATION OF THINGS 113 
Without touch, our capacity for wsthetie appreciation A 
would become emaciated. Even music, the most ethereal 
of all the arts, depends upon the tactile-motor part of our 
nature. Rhythm has a motor basis, and in the enjoyment 
of melody there is a kind of translation of ebb and flow 
and modulation of sound into spatial movements as vague 
tactile-motor excitations. The deaf can enjoy music because * 
it is capable of this tactile transmutation, : 
Most of the arts address themselves to the eye; but 
even here the sentiment of beauty derives much of its force 
from the tactile and motor memories which are vaguely 
awakened whenever we behold a painting, statue, or cathe- 
dral. Without many varied tactile experiences with surfaces, 
and refined touch discriminations, and many explorations 
of outlines with fingers, pencil, chisel, etc., in the back-) 
ground of consciousness, we could never get into that vague 
but most real tactile-motor communion with the objects 
which our eye contemplates. This tactile-motor communion 
lends depth to our esthetic reactions. Everything, however 
humble, which enriches the active and passive touch ex- 
periences of the child, will therefore contribute to higher 
zesthetic enjoyment. 
As Helen Keller says: “There is more meant in things 
than meets the eye.” ‘The wonderful rhythmical flow of 
lines and curves can be more subtly felt than seen.” “I 
know,” she says, “that the world I see with my fingers is 
alive, ruddy, satisfying.” Sometimes the experiences are 
so enchanting that her hands quiver with pleasure, for 
touch, too, has its ecstasies and is eloquent. “In touch is 
all love and intelligence.” 
“The thousand soft voices of the earth have truly found 
their way to me—the small rustle in tufts of grass, the 
silky swish of leaves, the buzz of insects, the hum of bees
-P-A-G-E-124
  114 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
in blossoms I have plucked, the flutter of a bird’s wings 
after his bath, and the slender rippling vibration of water 
running over pebbles. Once having been felt, these loved 
voices rustle, buzz, hum, flutter, and ripple in my thought 
forever, an undying part of happy memories.” 
“In the worlds of wonderment where I dwell 
I explore life with my hands; 
I recognize, and am happy ; 
My fingers are ever athirst for the earth, 
And drink up its wonders with delight, 
Draw out earth’s dear delights ; 
My feet are charged with the murmur, 
The throb, of all things that grow. 
“This is touch, this quivering, 
This flame, this ether, 
This glad rush of blood, 
This daylight in my heart, 
This glow of sympathy in my palms. 
Thou blind, loving, all-prying touch, 
Thou openest the book of life to me. 
The noiseless little noises of earth 
Come with softest rustle ; 
The shy, sweet feet of life; 
The silky flutter of moth wings 
Against my restraining palm.” 
  ‘Well may she sing a Chant of Darkness, for in this dark 
ness touch is quickened, and in touch lives the deepest 
appreciation of things. 
Though we cannot develop in every child the wonderful 
sensibility of Helen Keller, we can have more respect for 
the deep values that lie hidden in touch. They are often 
vague and nearly always inarticulate. Because these values 
cannot be put into words they have no recognition in the 
schools; but they can be communicated by teachers who 
show an enthusiasm for simple things.

TOUCH AND APPRECIATION OF THINGS 115 
The sense of smell was perhaps the first to differentiate 
itself from the sense of touch. The end organ for smell 
consists of a specialized skin, or epithelium, sensitive to 
gaseous, chemical stimuli. In the reptiles and early mam- 
mals the olfactory areas constitute by far the greater part 
of the cerebral hemisphere. Olfactory experiences and 
memories constitute the major part of the stream of con- 
sciousness in these animals. The ancient and once dominant 
character of smell gives this sense a strange, compelling 
emotional force. But we have come to depend upon other 
senses for information and culture, and neglect the cultiva- 
tion of the nose. This is probably inevitable, but not alto- 
gether deserving. Helen Keller declares that smell should 
hold a high place among its sister senses; and compared 
with this wonderful woman we are surely smell-blind. 
Every individual, except the babe up to about the age of 
seven, has a temperamental exhalation which Helen Keller 
can detect. “Human odors,” she says, “are as varied and 
as capable of recognition as hands and faces. The dear 
odors of those I love are so definite and unmistakable that 
nothing can quite obliterate them.” For the smell sensitive 
almost everything, even in the mineral kingdom, has a dis- 
tinctive odor. Poets have often shown a fine sense for the 
odors of mountain, field, and flowers, and sprinkle their 
verse with the perfume of olfactory metaphors. Surely that 
child is richer in experience, and in capacity to appreciate, 
who has sniffed delicately or inhaled deep drafts of the 
ethereal, the aromatic, and balsamic out of doors. 
Taste is close cousin to smell, and depends upon reénforce- 
ment from smell. We can say little of pertinence about 
taste, though no doubt there is something to be said. The 
gustatory passages in Thoreau’s essay on “ Wild Apples” 
are particularly suggestive.
-P-A-G-E-126
  116 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
The psychologist claims that the world of discernible 
sound vibrations comprises some 11,000 tones (and 850 
noises !). These occur in infinite combinations, and a mar- 
velous sensory apparatus, consisting of over a score of thou- 
sands of fibers, and hundreds of thousands of microscopic 
hairlets, picks up these varied vibrations so that they may 
become part of the soul. Sounds have an emotional power 
second only to odors and tactile impressions. Music is the 
language of the emotions. Melody and modulations are felt 
as well as heard, and the life of feeling shrinks if they do 
not in many forms find their way into consciousness. A child 
suffers whose auditory diet is limited chiefly to the Ameri- 
can drawled, nasal voice and the noises of civilization. Every 
normal child has an instinctive interest in sound as sound 
or jingle, irrespective of intellectual content. Hence the 
many experiments in productive sound-play, both vocal and 
instrumental. What is the psychology of the universal joy 
in running a stick over a picket fence, or in the trampling 
of crackling autumn leaves? Ideally the child should be 
surrounded with a richer range and larger amount of music. 
A good gramophone in every school, generously used, would 
add much to sensory development, but more important still 
is that most marvelous of all sound-producing instruments, 
the human voice. Melodious and modulated voices in teach- 
ers would inscrutably, but none the less vitally, work won- 
ders in the character and sensibilities of the children. 
Finally, we come to vision, which boasts the most exalted 
position among the senses. It is peculiarly the intellectual 
sense, photographic in fidelity, panoramic in scope. It fur- 
nishes a wealth of material for the imagination. No organ 
is being strained more by the progress of civilization than 
the eye. The race is becoming eye-minded. Elementary 
education has long been so, and too much so. Important as
-P-A-G-E-127
TOUCH AND APPRECIATION OF THINGS 117 
~ vision is, it lacks vitality and depth. It is, after all, objective 
and superficial when compared with touch, which Diderot 
called, of all the senses, the most profound and philosophical. 
Instruction which is eye-deep is not very deep, and dispro- 
portionate reliance upon the seeing of things and words 
tends to cripple the sensory life of the child, especially of 
the primary child, who is ear-minded and touch-minded 
before he is eye-minded. Seeing implies merely an impres- 
sion. ‘Touch implies more. It implies an impression plus 
an emotional glow. No one, of course, would try to argue 
away the importance of keen visual perception and a vigor- 
ous visualizing power, but seeing without touch is innocuous 
and sophisticated. Of primary importance are the tactile 
and motor experiences. These alone can make the physical 
things tingle with values and suggestion. The child who 
does not have this well-stored background of tactile-motor 
experience may be the man who, though he has eyes, sees 
not. There would not be so many indifferent and inert 
people in the world if all children could come into a more 
intimate and emotionally tinged tactual contact with their 
environment. 
We are not anxious in this chapter to make the distinc- 
tions of technical psychology between perception, sensation, 
sense feeling, and apperception. We do believe, however, 
that it is important to emphasize the difference between 
mere passive sense perception, or apprehension, and what 
we may call the appreciation of things. Perception has been 
defined as a feeling of things present to the senses. Appre- 
ciation is a feeling for things, —an impression colored with 
a subjective attitude and leaving an afterglow of emotion. 
If the schoolroom is allowed to be a word factory and the 
handwork and nature study become perfunctory and noetic, 
children will not be as appreciative as they might. Teachers  
-P-A-G-E-128
  118 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
and parents must have not only articulate knowledge of 
things but a kind of enthusiasm for things. They must 
come into the mood of the psalmist, and of the poet who 
said: “I believe in the flesh and the appetite. Seeing, hear- 
ing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a 
miracle.” It is a common error to think that the emotional 
part of our nature is to be reserved for state occasions, for 
weddings, elections, and birthdays. As a matter of fact, a 
sensitive nature attaches certain emotional sense feelings 
to such simple stimuli as an isolated color or a single 
musical tone. 
One of the besetting sins of the primary school is lan- 
guor, apathy, — apathy in speech, in movement, in action, 
and apathy in perception. This springs from the insidious    
   
   
                   
   
         
    overvaluation of words. The teacher has an overrespect for 
words, forgetful that they are the technique and not the 
ingredients of culture. This bookishness and wordiness 
start often with the very first day of school, and develop 
a precocious use and misuse of words that amounts to 
pedantry. Pestalozzi realized that this was one of the evils 
of primary education, and in the year of our Declara- 
tion of Independence he makes the two following entries 
in his diary: 
“O God, who art my father and the father of my child, 
teach me to understand the holy, natural laws by which 
Thou preparest us slowly, by means of an innumerable 
variety of impressions, for the conceiving of exact and 
complete ideas of which words are but the signs!” 
“Lead your child out into nature. Teach him on the 
hilltops and in the valleys; there he will listen better. But 
in these hours of freedom let him be taught by nature] 
rather than by you. Let him fully realize that she is the 
real teacher, and that you with your art do nothing mor 
 
-P-A-G-E-129
  
TOUCH AND APPRECIATION OF THINGS 119 
than to walk quietly by her side. Should a bird sing, or an 
insect hum on a leaf, at once stop your talk. Birds and 
insects are teaching him. You may be silent.” 
Education is too often confounded with verbal instruction 
and recitation and word drill. Asa matter of fact the deepest 
and most educative experiences are wordless contact with 
things. The teacher may hold the hand of the child, as 
Pestalozzi did when he took his Jacobli into the mountains, 
and may quietly smile in enjoyment of the hum or the song 
or the glimmer, hoping that by suggestion the child may 
catch the smile and thus the beauty; but words are of 
no avail. This is what Stevenson had at heart when he 
wrote his convincing apology for idlers. He spoke with 
pitying contempt of the extreme wordy busyness of the 
schools, which tend to produce “a sort of dead-alive, hack- 
neyed people, who are scarcely conscious of living except 
in the exercise of some conventional occupation.” “ Books 
are good enough in their own way,” he says, “but they are 
a mighty bloodless substitute for life.” It is not through 
heroic word drills, but “by looking out of his eyes and 
hearkening in his ears with a smile on his face” that the 
child will acquire “the warm, palpitating facts of life,” which 
is true education. 
Emotion is everything. If perception is allowed to de- 
generate, because of the listlessness in schools and home, 
into cold apprehension, untold harm is done to real moral 
and temperamental development. We are not pleading for 
keenness of sense so much as for emotiveness. The senses 
are considered as servants of the body; they should be 
exalted into the service of the soul. Every one feels the 
beautiful spirituality of Helen Keller’s nature, but it would 
be a sad error to conclude that this is due to the fact that. 
she has been shut out from the world of sense. Read her
-P-A-G-E-130
  
  120 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
fine encomiums of the black-sheep senses, touch and smell, 
and you will realize that the very foundation of her 
spiritual power is rooted in the wealth of emotion derived | 
from the loving use of these bodily senses. One could even 
argue that her spirituality would have suffered had the 
curtain of night been raised from her eyes. Vision is so 
objective, and may be so superficial, as actually to handicap 
moral growth. It would be a boon if we could live a little 
more in “the wise, vital, thought-quickening dark,” — in 
the twilight regions of that most profoundly emotional 
sense, touch. Every atom of Helen Keller’s body is a vibro- 
scope. Sweet, beautiful vibrations exist for her touch, and 
we who control the sensory development of children should 
heed her exhortation : 
“Hold out your hands to feel the luxury of the sun- 
beams. Press the soft blossoms against your cheek, and 
finger their graces of form, their delicate mutability of 
shape, their pliancy and freshness. Expose your face to the 
aérial floods that sweep the heavens, ‘inhale great drafts 
of space,’ wonder— wonder at the wind’s unwearied 
activity. Pile note on note the infinite music that flows 
increasingly to your soul from the tactual sonorities of a 
thousand branches and tumbling waters. How can the 
world be shriveled when this most profound emotional 
sense, touch, is faithful to its service ? Tam sure that if 
a fairy bade me choose between the sense of sight and that 
_of touch, I would not part with the warm, endearing con- 
tact of human hands, or the wealth of form, the mobility 
and fullness that press into my palms.” 
The appreciation of things mounts to its highest flight in 
the spiritual and poetic nature. Primitive man actually wor- 
shiped, and with deep feeling, mute rocks and cliffs. For} 
Wordsworth, even the loose stones that pave the common
-P-A-G-E-131
  
TOUCH AND APPRECIATION OF THINGS 121 
highway respired with an inner meaning. When the spirit 
of appreciation wells up in the poet, it knows no bounds. 
It reaches out and embraces all the manifold objects of 
nature, animate and inanimate, —the high vibrating stars, 
the rolling ocean, the gorgeous clouds of sunset, the grow- 
ing wheat, silent plants, and creatures dumb. For all of 
these the poet feels a high and tender kinship, endows them 
with one kindred impulse, and speaks in words of almost 
loving companionship to the mountain daisy or to the wee 
cowering beastie in the stibble. For Burns even the mousie 
is a poor earthborn companion and fellow mortal. Sidney 
* Lanier, in his fervent poem, “Sunrise,” addresses with affec- 
tionate appeal the “Sweet, burly barked, man-bodied trees, 
O beloved, my live oaks,” and begs of their foliage to 
teach him the terms of silence. “Ye ministers meet for each 
passion that grieves, friendly, sisterly, sweetheart leaves!” 
Here appreciation rises to the ecstatic pitch of animistic 
comradeship. This is the poet’s privilege and the child’s 
inclination; for poets are childlike, and the child is by 
nature a poet. 
The instinctive psychoses so intimately associated with 
touch make this sense extremely important for morality as 
well as esthetic enjoyment. For morality has its being in 
our instinctive, impulsive, emotional attitudes, — not only 
attitudes toward persons, but toward things, minerals, 
plants, and animals. In some inscrutable way refinement 
of sensibility is correlated with delicacy of moral sentiment, 
and coldness of perception with coldness of character. The 
very etymology and double connotation of adjectives like 
coarse, supple, dainty, rude, and delicate, betray a funda- 
mental relationship between tactile and ethical qualities. 
Manners and wood both are smooth or polished; and conduct, 
lace, and wire may all be fine. It cannot be demonstrated

    122 THE GENETIC BACKGROUND 
in the laboratory, but undoubtedly the tactile tenderness 
with which a rough street boy handles a collection of 
delicate butterflies in some way irradiates into the sphere 
of general conduct and softens his deportment. 
There are tactile-ethical values in nature study and 
handwork: the tactile attitudes of tenderness and pro- 
tection which a boy feels for fragile birds’ eggs carefully 
stored, perhaps with a caress, in cotton; the perfect 
polishing of a wood surface; the respect for the fiber and 
individual resistant qualities of material; the rounding of 
edges and corners for comfort and beauty; the obedience 
to lines, drawings, and so forth; the accuracy and truth- * 
fulness in fitting edges; the general submission to the laws 
of nature whenever a piece of raw material is attacked. 
We can suggest rather than demonstrate the important 
bearings of all this. 
See how a child will stroke a smooth surface with half 
~ awesome delight. What does it mean? It means that life 
is more than words. In due time, of course, the child 
should be able to speak and spell a declarative sentence, 
stating that the sensation felt exquisite. Sometime he may 
even discuss whether “rapturous” is a better adjective. 
But, after all, the adjective is but a tag or a symbol. The 
sensation itself is unutterable. | Character is made up of 
attitudes, appreciations ; and verbal images, although very 
essential to abstract thinking, are idle and void unless they 
are born of concrete contact. 
The psychology of peoples has been molded by the great 
silent geographical and geological features ever present in 
their environment. The prairie is in the Indian, the moun-

the thin layer of the intellect into the deeper strata of the 
heart, especially the heart of the child. 
Since the process is half mystical it baffles descriptive 
psychology, but the poet seems to know how to tell it. 
The following is selected from a poem by Walt Whitman, 
which is one of the most understanding things ever written 
about childhood. 
There was a child went forth every day, 
And the first object he looked upon, that object he became, 
And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part of 
the day, 
Or for many years or stretching cycles of years. 
The early lilacs became part of this child, 
And grass and white and red morning-glories, and white and red 
clover, and the song of the phoebe bird, 
And the third-month lambs and the sow’s pink-faint litter, and the 
mare’s foal and the cow’s calf, 
And the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the pond side, 
And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there, and 
the beautiful curious liquid, 
And the water plants with their. graceful flat heads, all became part 
of him. 
His own parents, he that had fathered him and she that‘had conceived 
him in her womb and birthed him, 
They gave this child more of themselves than that, 
They gave him afterward every day, they became part of him. 
The mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the supper table, 
The mother with mild words, clean her cap and gown, a wholesome 
odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by, 
The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, angered, unjust, 
The strata of colored clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint away 
solitary by itself, the spread of purity it lies motionless in, 
The horizon’s edge, the flying sea crow, the fragrance of salt marsh 
and shore mud, 
These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who 
now goes, and will always go forth every day.

It would spoil this poem to comment on it analytically. 
Could there be a finer statement of faith in education, of

part of the child who goes forth every day to school, and 
in largest measure if she communicates to him a loving 
appreciation of the commonplace things which will always 
surround him.

THE PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
CHAPTER IX 
DRAWING 
The period of childhood is a period of self-revealing 
expression. One of the most characteristic and interesting 
forms of such expression is drawing. 
Spontaneous drawing is really a form of play, and in the 
early years children need about as little instruction in draw- 
ing as they do in any play. It is instinctive for a child to 
test his powers, to externalize himself, to leave a mark. He 
takes instinctive delight in being a cause, and even before 
his first birthday he may seize a piece of chalk and scrawl 
with it. “ 
These earliest scribbles are of course an expression of the 
instinct of workmanship hardly less crude than the random, 
aimless kicking of legs and brandighing of arms in the crib. 
There may be an element of mith 
there is no conscious purpose or design. 
The scribble period, according to Lukens, who studied 
and classified hundreds of children’s spontaneous drawings, 
~ lasts until about the age of four. If a child did not rise to 
a higher type of expression in this time, it would be a case 
of arrested development. Just as his play becomes more and 
more expressive of ideas and models, so does his penciling ; 
125 in the activity, but

126 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
he does not forever shove and fumble his blocks, but he 
arranges them in rows, walls, and pillars. That is, he exter- 
nalizes mental states in objective construction ; and what is 
drawing but this? Even when he crawls about on all fours 
in imitation of some quadruped, he is indulging in a form 
of representative behavior which is psychologically akin to

drawing ; for primitive drawing is a kind of pantomime with 
a pencil point, or graphic gesture. Early childhood drawing 
is essentially language, and when the child gives his scrawls 
names, they can no longer be called mere scribbles. 
In the second period of its development drawing becomes 
representative. This representative stage falls between the 
ages of four to about ten, but there is no sudden transition 
from one stage to the other. In fact, the scribbles of the early
-P-A-G-E-137
  DRAWING 127 
period are themselves often crudely representative, as indi- 
cated in Fig. 23, where the marks stand for a dozen different 
things, from a hippopotamus to an airship. A kindergartner 
once took a band of children, all under five years of age, to 
see a cow. They were asked to draw what they saw. At 
first sight the drawings looked like a collection of the rudest 
  Fie. 24. A Cow 
Kindergarten representation after a trip to the dairyman 
scrawls, but close examination showed e¥idences of articulate 
expression, — here and there a controlled mark to represent 
the head, tail, or udder of the cow (Fig. 24). As Empedocles 
explained the development of animals by the assemblage of 
their constituent parts, so even in this chaos there was an 
evolution of definite wholes, — drawing in the making. 
The most primitive scribbles of the nursery are made in 
pure enjoyment of motor activity for its own sake, but the 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  128 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
kindergarten and primary child awakening to a new sense 
of his powers makes marks in the spirit of true language. 
He is in the golden age of imitative, dramatic, and crea- 
tive expression. All his play is full of self-illusion, and 
so is his drawing. Form is for him but the symbol, not 
the mirror of reality; hence his splendid disdain for accu- 
rate outline and his beautifully naive interest in the mean- 
ing or the story. Unembarrassed by compunctions about 
fidelity and proportion, he draws out of his head and out 
of his heart. 
We may smile at his crude productions, but for him they 
glow with the warmth of his own personality and throb 
with life and action. Drawing for him is language, not in- 
different and clumsy portrayal of the objective world. He 
draws what he knows, not what he sees. He draws the foot 
in the shoe and the core in the apple, for though invisi- 
ble he knows they are there. He will even draw action, — 
dancing, sunlight, and the wind. He loves to project his ex- 
periences where he can enjoy them and make them more 
distinct to consciousness. By this process of externalizing 
the internal he comes into nearer kinship with his environ- 
ment. Drawing is therefore highly educative; but if it is 
not related to his own experiences, and ceases to be self- 
expressive, it becomes merely a reproduction of the external, 
and cannot stimulate growth. This at least is the conclusion 
of the psychological*point of view. 
The logical viewpoint ignores the child’s natural interest 
and misinterprets his capacities. It regards drawing as a 
technique to be imparted to him in a progressive, systematic 
manner, beginning with simple straight lines, curves, angles, 
and elementary geometric forms. The argument is like that 
which used to be applied to the teaching of reading: The 
English language is made up of letters, let us teach these
-P-A-G-E-139
  DRAWING A 129 
simple elements first, and proceed logically from them to 
syllables, words, and sentences. 
Froebel, whose writings often contain a singular confusion 
of the logical and psychological points of view, said: “As 
the drawing of lines precedes the drawing of figures, so also 
there proceeds from it the invention of forms, ascending to 
imitation and copying; and further, after the pupil has 
made the required progress in geometry and mathematics, 
perspective drawing, instruction regarding light and shade 
as well as drawing from nature, landscape drawing, etc., 
will follow. The last aim, as everywhere, is the representa- 
tion of man; that is, the representation of the human figure.” 
In a certain kindergarten manual, still widely used, the 
« author recommends that even “in free drawing the child 
should use a line of a certain kind or of several kinds indi- 
cated, with some restriction grouping these either to sym- 
metrical forms or to representations of objects; that is, 
so-called forms of life.” 
It sounds very logical that simple lines should be mas- 
tered first, and that cylinders and cones should be mastered 
before trying to draw a complex thing like a tree, whose 
trunks and branches are combinations of cylinders and 
cones. Such pedagogy seems very reasonable and consider- 
ate, but it is really timid and false, because it thwarts the 
natural manifestation and expansion of the child’s power. 
The primary child is in the expressive; language period of 
development, and every opportunity for expression should 
be open to him. If we limit him to a line of a certain kind, 
or to blocked-out squares or certain prescribed subjects, his 
drawing will become rigid, wooden, cramped, and expres- 
sionless. Give him a mood, something to say, something to 
illustrate; give him large undemarcated spaces, like the 
blackboard, so his expression may be full and free. He will
-P-A-G-E-140
130 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
flinch at nothing, and with fine abandon he will make the 
chalk tell his experiences, even though they may be as com- 
plicated as a circus parade. Froebel would make the human 
figure the last aim; with the child it is the very first, for 
his interests and not his capacities determine what he will 
draw. Lukens, who collected over twelve hundred sponta- 
neous drawings by children under ten, found that 75 per 
cent of the specimens contained the human figure. If draw- 
ing were mere tracery imitation of external objects, the 
child might balk at difficult subjects, and surely he would 
not draw such invisible things as the wind, the sunlight, and 
motion. But he draws what he knows and what he feels, 
and there is no better way of developing his knowledge 
and feeling than by giving him a chance to express both. 
Take, for example, the sense of humor, which receives 
such scant recognition in school life. Little children have 
a very decided and promising fund of humor, even though 
the opposite has been supposed, and those who doubt the 
fact will perhaps be partly convinced by the accompany- 
ing funny drawings, which were made without instruc- 
tion or suggestion by kindergarten and primary children. 
Fig. 25, B, represents a girl, who is funny because she has 
such a gigantic hand; Fig. 25, C, is a half cow, with only 
two legs; Fig. 25, D, is rather obscure, but is comical to 
the artist, who said that it was “a strawberry all squeezed 
up from the rain, and a funny pig with his nose sticking up 
and a flag on his back.” All these drawings were made by 
kindergarten children. 
Most of the other pictures in Figs. 25, 26, and 27 were 
drawn by first-grade and second-grade children. They 
speak for themselves, and the sympathetic sense of humor 
of the reader must be depended upon to do them full 
justice. It is unfortunate that we cannot reproduce the

Fie. 25. Humorous Drawines 
131
-P-A-G-E-142
132. PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
chuckles and the expressions of extreme delight which 
sometimes accompanied the working out of these comical 
conceptions. 
The chief ingredients of elementary humor are embodied 
in these drawings: grotesqueness, both in color and design 
(for example, see Fig. 27, C); incongruity, in the haber- 
dashered horse (Fig. 27, B); exaggeration, in the prolonga- 
tion and uniting of the tails of the two dogs (Fig. 26, 4); 
surprise and unexpected action, in the man who stands on 
tiptoe and manages before your eyes to kick his hat from his 
own head (Fig. 25, £); physical discomfort, in the boy 
about to be struck in the nose by a ball (Fig. 26, D), in 
the dog with the can tied to his tail (Fig. 25, A), and cer- 
tainly in the poor man (Fig. 27, D) with his hands full 
of newspapers, who is being tormented from head to foot 
by a monkey, a bee, and a dog, with prospects of further 
discomfort from the vulture overhead. 
Among the third-grade drawings are indications of hu- 
morous situations as well as simple character sketches. In 
Fig. 26, B, we see three boys indulging in antics on a stage, 
and a giant’s finger, represented by the line on the left, is 
dragging the boys behind the scenes. Fig. 26, C, represents 
a goat who wanted to have some fun on the Fourth of July, 
and who therefore butted a hot stove among firecrackers { 
and skyrockets! 
The ten-year-old boy who drew Fig. 27, A, cannot discuss 
the principle of mistaken identity in comedy, but he ex- 
plains the humor of his: drawing in these words: “The 
funniest thing I ever saw is this picture becous it has its 
colars in such funney places. I think it is the funnist thing 
becous it is to represent ‘Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack 
jump over the candle stick,’ when it is not Jack at all, only 
a picture of a kangaroo jumping over a candle stick.”

DRAWING 135 
This is no place to go into a discussion of the interesting 
problem of humor in children, but these drawings strongly 
declare the existence and educational possibilities of their 
humor sense. It should be said that these drawings are not 
unusual; that they are little more than casual selections out 
of a small number of specimens. The sense of humor is 
present in all normal children, and drawing furnishes a fine 
avenue for its expression. We asked a boy of five if he 
could draw something funny for us. “Can I!” he said. “My 
head is just full of funny things”; and soon he was at work 
with absorbed attention and chuckling laughter. One of 
his productions he called the “ Duke de Callaboose,” and he 
proceeded at once to dramatize him. The serious school 
may have no place for the dramatic rendition, but drawing, 
with all its humorous life and action, is in a sense a mild 
and cathartic kind of dramatization. 
Humor is one of the most valuable and beneficent traits 
in human nature. In its highest forms it means sympathy, 
insight, philosophy, originality; but these higher expres- 
sions are derived from the lower, and children’s humor is 
not to be despised simply because it is primitive. Moreover, 
it is not nearly so crude as we are accustomed to think, 
and it responds wonderfully to suggestion and cultivation. 
Considering the limited experience of primary children, 
their comic productions are very creditable. The best of 
them are positively creative in spirit. The attention of the 
children while they worked out their comic inventions was 
unusually intense. This is itself a significant fact. 
Humor is too precious to go to waste and to be left 
altogether to chance. The child who has a good supply of 
it will meet life better than the child without it. The 
child’s natural genius leads him to select the salient and 
the vital. The caricaturist is the keen but smiling man of
-P-A-G-E-146
  186 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
insight in whom this genius has not atrophied, and who 
can express it through his drawings as he crudely did when 
he was a child. The drawings of Figs. 28 and 29 were 
made by a grammar-school boy, and represent the fruition 
of the humorous drawings of the primary grade. 
Drawing has a threefold significance, says Dr. Burnham 
in his excellent article on the hygiene of the subject: “ first, 
  
  
  Fie. 28. Cmsar rerusine THE CRowN

as a form of natural reaction to feeling; second, as giving 
the satisfaction which comes from productive activity and 
social expression ; third, as developing an interest in art 
through the possibilities of imitation. From the ordinary 
point of view of hygiene this is vague, but the psychiatrist 
and the teacher who appreciate the importance to health 
of a normal life of feeling, of the satisfaction from suc- 
cessful activity and the balance which results from culture 
interests, cannot fail to see the positive hygienic significance
-P-A-G-E-147
  DRAWING 137 
of drawing and similar forms of artistic expression.” The 
humorous drawings described above offer a very good 
illustration of all these points. 
Among the forms of artistic expression to which drawing 
is closely related may be mentioned dramatic impersonation, 
dancing, paper cutting, paper tearing, clay modeling, wri 
ing, and even oral language. Some of these relationship 
a

Another caricature by the same boy 
we have already suggested. What a child imitates with 
his whole body in dramatic play he will gladly portray 
on the blackboard; or what he has just drawn he will 
readily impersonate, as did the author of the “Duke de 
Callaboose.” Teachers could work out very good exercises 
embodying the reciprocal use of these two modes of artistic 
speech, — drawing and dramatic play. Children like to talk 
about what they have drawn, and their sketches furnish 
an excellent opportunity for enthusiastic language work,
-P-A-G-E-148
  138 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
conversation with a real motive and subject. Expressionless 
children who can usually be drawn out only with diffi- 
culty can be awakened to fluent oral language through 
spontaneous drawings. 
The production and interpretation of pictures, it is ad- 
mitted, preceded the printed page in the history of the race, 
and so it should be with the child. The folly of bringing 
the technicalities of reading and writing to unorganized 
minds is nowhere more evident than in the character of 
children’s early drawings. The detail, the sequence and 
organization of the printed page, are conspicuously absent 
in these drawings; but the advantage of drawing lies pre- 
cisely in the fact that it is a more instinctive and fluid 
medium of expression, — that it favors rather than impedes 
mental organization. A child whose reading and writing 
lessons have been preceded by a liberal use of free drawing 
comes with a mind better organized for these less instine- 
tive tasks. The good teacher will make many connections 
between the pictographic and the typographic art. She will 
have children label their drawings with words and phrases, 
and their words with drawings. She will have them fill out 
their sentences, rebuslike, with sketches; and will allow 
them to illustrate in their own way the readers and dic- 
tionaries which they will make. Stories told by words can 
later be retold by chalk or crayon, and handwork may be 
both preceded and supplemented by drawings. Ina follow- 
ing chapter we shall show how the work in writing can 
make many connections with drawing; but even if such 
connections could not be made, large free-hand drawing 
would still have the great advantage of establishing a 
poise and muscular control which will facilitate greatly the 
acquisition of the technique of penmanship. Drawing gives 
the fundamental muscles their needed development.
-P-A-G-E-149
  
DRAWING 139 
But we must always come back to the vital point, that 
the supreme value of drawing for primary children lies in 
the fact that it is a fluid medium of expression for both 
thought and feeling. If the teacher, in blind obedience 
to mimeographed prescriptions or the course of study, uses 
drawing in a formal manner, aiming chiefly at the mastery 
of technical ability, the subject loses its chief value for little 
children. Drawing in the primary school should be regarded 
as an elastic vehicle of expression, not as a kind of motor 
dexterity. It should link itself to the children’s own. inter- 
ests, images, emotions, and should bespeak these rather than 
a cunningly planned system of logical adult exactions. 
Many of the systems in use at this day make this in- 
sidious mistake of trying to suit the technique of drawing 
to the child, instead of simply giving the child a free and 
less-charted opportunity for real expression. These sys- 
tems often look modern, and are in reality superior to the 
old stigmographic and network methods, but still they fail 
to appreciate the significance of a volume of free expressive 
drawing during the golden period of artistic illusion. 
All truly expressive motor activity has a deeply educative 
effect which cannot be judged by the ephemeral outward 
results. This is especially true of drawing and paper cut- 
ting, if they are abundantly used. Both favor good posture, 
decisive muscular control, and self-reliant executiveness. 
To successfully draw or cut what he thinks or feels, has a 
profound reflex effect upon the ethical nature of the little 
artist, giving him a sense of power and that fine feeling of 
moral joy which go with all artistic production. The spirit in 
which the paper cuttings in Fig. 830 were made was enough 
to justify them, irrespective of all technical considerations. 
The second-grade children who made these drawings were 
of many different nationalities, and came from wretched 
   
-P-A-G-E-150
  140 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
homes in a large manufacturing town. The class had been 
studying the subject of transportation, and what they felt 
and knew they expressed by their fingers with wonderful 
eagerness and ease. It took them only a very few minutes 
to take out their materials and cut all these vehicles and 
put them in the visitor’s hands. Thanks to the atmosphere 
and instruction of the school, these children cut paper ex- 
pressively with about as much assurance and. alacrity as 
they spoke sentences. 
This is the ideal for primary drawing. When. drawing 
ceases to be merely a prescriptive exercise, and becomes a 
natural, easy means of expression, then it will do its most 
for the education of the child. Drawing instruction in the 
public schools should not become “the grave of talent 
and naturalness.” Chamberlain quotes Dr. Heim as saying, 
“Many a fifteen-year-old boy and many an adult can, for 
example, no longer draw the picture of a bird which at the 
age of from five to ten years he was able to make before 
any instruction in drawing.” 
Why is this? Chamberlain thinks because “ the delight 
in drawing which reigned in earlier years has been sup- 
pressed under the weight of method and direction. The 
child’s own book filled with innumerable sketches of almost 
every object disappears before the sheet with the correctly 
drawn ornament or geometrical figure. Life no longer calls 
to him to represent it ; the deadest of dead things are fash- 
ioned by him at the beck of others.” It may be added 
that even leaves, vegetables, and fruit may be half-dead 
things if the children have no artistic mood or motive in 
their production. 
We must preserve the naive delight and daring of natural 
childish drawing. At about the age of ten the child per- 
haps inevitably takes some interest in technique. He sees
-P-A-G-E-151
  
 
-P-A-G-E-152
    
142 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
the disparity between the reality and his representation of 
it, and the period of self-conscious criticism sets in. This 
is, according to Lukens, the third stage in the evolution of 
drawing, which may be followed by a fourth stage, begin- 
ning about the fifteenth year or later, “when for some 
fortunate individuals, favored by environment or other 
stimulus, adolescence exhibits a recrudescence of the old 
creative power, a reinvigoration of the pristine love of 
producing”; but for most people the golden age of ex- 
pressiveness, with its enchantment of artistic self-illusion, 
vanishes forever. 
Inability to draw is almost universal, and even many of 
those who can draw fairly well in the art class, do not 
carry this power into their lives, do not enliven their letters 
with sketches, or, if they are teachers, do not talk with 
the chalk in that daring, suggestive way which fascinates 
children and vivifies all instruction. It is as if drawing 
were a dead language, which, like Latin, remains dead even 
after years of study of grammar and technique. Or have 
niggardliness in the use of drawing, and the unpsycho- 
logical methods of presentation, developed a kind of com- 
pulsive fear and embarrassment, equivalent to stuttering 
in oral language? There is no need of overlaboring the 
suggestion, but the fact remains that the use of drawing as 
a means of expression suffers almost universal arrest and 
atrophy. “For every ten geniuses of drawing in the 
nursery, there remains hardly one in the high school. We 
are killing the art that made art.” Even children in the 
kindergarten, working freely with the broad side of the 
chalk, will, after a little practice, produce landscapes pos- 
sessing a real if elusive element of creativeness in them, 
pictures which might at least find a place in some collec- 
tions of impressionistic art. And when steaming battleships,

DRAWING 143 
fighting Indians, and running deer are drawn, the lines 
are often salient and dramatic enough to be called truly 
artistic. The spirit and the power which are latent in 
these drawings it is the duty of the schools to nourish. 
Nowhere does Schiller’s observation seem more applicable, 
that if we all lived up to the promise of childhood, we 
should all be geniuses. ot

DRAMATIC EXPRESSION 
The purpose of the introduction of dramatic play into 
the schoolroo: 
cally receivec m, like so many good things too enthusiasti- 
, is being sadly misunderstood. ‘The teacher 
with initiative seizes upon the suggestion without due 
consideration, interprets a bit of literature, persuades the 
children to memorize her interpretation, and presents a fin- 
ished produc to a host of admiring mothers who are unfit 
to criticize its educational value.

therefore, exceed the results obtained. In its   formative period dramatic representation is productive ; it 
is these growing pains which count in education. When 
144
-P-A-G-E-155
  
DRAMATIC EXPRESSION 145 
the climax of growth is reached there is a rapid and steady 
degeneration. 
The term “ dramatic play ” is misleading ; one should say 
“dramatic expression ” or “dramatic interpretation,” which 
are more inclusive, and have to do with the means, not the 
end. Dramatic interpretation may be applied to all the work 
of the classroom, —a vital spark of life dropped into the lap 
of formalism and routine.\ All work which is imaginative, 
constructive, and vivid is dramatic. It is this interpretation 
of the drama, rather than its more limited phase of dra- 
matic play, which needs to find its way into the schools. I 
need not, therefore, necessarily give a play to use dramatic 
interpretation in school work, but I do need to present 
geography, history, and even mathematics dramatically. I 
must infuse an emotional quality into the ideas to be in- 
stilled, for emotion is the connecting link between facts 
and life. It is not only necessary that I know a fact, but I 
must feel it in its relation to humanity. 
Dramatic representation is instinctive, and instincts dom- 
inate childhood. Through such interpretation the child 
touches heights and depths which otherwise might never 
enter into his experience. Life becomes larger as he learns 
to lay aside his own limitations and put himself in the 
other man’s place. He need not wait to enlist in the army 
to become a soldier, nor carry a real gun to acquire a 
martial step. He need not do wrong himself in order to 
know the remorse of wrongdoing. The child is egoistic, 
and that which he understands must bear an intimate and 
personal relation. Just as he must take into his hands the 
concrete thing he studies, and by physical contact under- 
stand it, so, to understand thought, emotion, character, he 
must assimilate them, lose himself in them, and become for 
the time being that thing which he interprets.
-P-A-G-E-156
    146 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
The child tries on and throws off moods and emotions 
easily, for his young body is alert, sensitive, and supple. 
It is not hampered by the fixed habits of thought and 
feeling which make the adult impervious to suggestion and 
variation. Dramatic representation recognizes this, and in- 
volves the use of the child’s whole body ; without special- 
ization, amcebalike, he takes in impressions with every part 
of it. The child is undifferentiated emotionally. He does 
not smile when he is glad, but fairly dances with joy. He 
does not shed a few tears when he is unhappy, but kicks 
and shakes with his grief. The opportunity to make use of 
his whole body in the expression of his feeling, which he 
is compelled to do in dramatic interpretation, will serve to 
equalize and conserve his moral strength. Emotional ex- 
pression, although dependent upon instinct, must not be 
left to chance. Instinct and emotion are as capable of or- 
ganization as motor and mental processes, but not through 
didactic prescription. Here more than anywhere else organ- 
ization and education must go on within the pupil himself 
through the illuminating process of self-expression, passing 
from its fundamental to accessory phases. 
Just as drawing and clay modeling bring form into relief 
and necessitate clear images,.so dramatic work brings char- 
acter into consciousness, making mood, motive, cause and 
effect, stand out in relative proportion. Such expression 
brings to the emotional life what travel and study bring to 
the intellectual. 
Dramatic work also organizes the child’s thinking., The 
simple and imperfect images of childhood are vivified and 
crystallized by being transformed into the movements which 
express them, and a child emerges from dramatic repre- 
sentation fortified in his mental imagery. Action and imi- 
tation are potent factors in the education of children, and
-P-A-G-E-157
  
DRAMATIC EXPRESSION 147 
the dramatic work makes it possible to secure purposeful 
activity, as well as to organize and limit that which one 
would have the child imitate. 
{ Dramatic work enriches experience, relieves formality, 
reduces restlessness, and establishes a reciprocal attitude 
between teacher and pupil. \It vitalizes the reading, illumi- 
nates geography and history, and gives motive and utility 
to the handwork.) It chases out self-consciousness and gives 
an incentive to public speaking and impromptu address. 
It organizes the imagination ; seizes upon essentials through 
the enforced: limitations of time and space, and sets free 
a sense of humor out of which will grow a sympathetic 
philosophy of life. Dramatic expression invites a copious 
vocabulary and lends significance to the school library., A 
book on manners and customs will be little used until the 
child needs the information which it contains to portray 
some character. 
Dramatic representation of historical subjects opens 
history to the girls.\ History becomes not only the story 
of some great man’s life, but the portrayal of the lives of 
a people, —the account of the struggles and victories of an 
epoch in which women figured and lent significant help. 
A few suggestions as to the method of presentation may 
not be out of place. The interest of the work grows out of 
certain fundamental instincts of childhood,— imitation, 
construction, and motor activity. Unless the manner of 
calling these instincts into play is well organized, the whole 
value of the art is lost. Dramatic play in the early grades 
means the hardest kind of thinking and a most definite 
creative effort. The moment that it degenerates into super- 
ficial play and noisy representation it ceases to belong to 
the school period and has no right to the precious school 
hours. One test of the worth of dramatic play in the
-P-A-G-E-158
  148 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
school is the effect which it has upon the general discipline 
and conduct of the room. As soon as dramatic play leads 
to disorganization the teacher may be sure that she needs 
to look into her methods. If the work is presented with 
the proper forethought and planning, it becomes the prop 
of discipline. Boys and girls whom it has been impossible 
to control in any other way have been led to obedience and 
a sense of responsibility by codperation in the dramatic 
work. One small boy of our acquaintance, upon whose 
saucy head every form of penalty had been laid without 
effect, was aroused to earnest effort and good conduct by 
being allowed to take part in the dramatic work when he 
had fulfilled his other obligations, and by being denied this 
privilege when he had not. It was he who thought of an 
ingenious way of escaping the wolf when he played the 
story of “The Three Little Pigs.” The wolf was in hot 
pursuit, and the audience trembled for the little pig till 
he suddenly seized the waste-paper basket, curled up in it, 
and rolled to his house in safety. 
First, then, the failure of the work in its early stages is 
due to a lack of organization. Dramatic work should be 
begun in the kindergarten, and should proceed with increas- 
ing complexity through the grades. It should have its ini- 
tial start in the simplest representation, and should be well 
within the grasp of the players. The simplest form of rep- 
resentations is pantomime, and this may be begun in con- 
nection with the reading lessons. For instance, one child 
may illustrate some simple action in pantomime, which 
another may interpret in a simple sentence to be written on 
the blackboard. When the board is full of such sentences 
the review of the reading becomes very simple; every child 
is eager to choose a sentence, and without telling which 
one, to illustrate it, while another points to the sentence 
*
-P-A-G-E-159
  
DRAMATIC EXPRESSION 149 
describing the action. Such a plan necessitates the reread- 
ing of all the sentences by each member of the class, and 
the words are being given significance by the accompanying 
illustration. For instance, the following sentences might 
result: “I am chopping wood”; “I am washing dishes” ; 
“I am ironing my clothes”; “I am riding my horse”; “I 
am flying my kite”; “I am watering the flowers.” A whole 
vocabulary of words may be learned and reviewed with the 
closest application on the part of the children. 
This pantomime may be followed by simple character 
sketches, in which a child may portray quickly, and with 
both gesture and language, a father, a mother, an old witch, 
a brownie, a newspaper boy, a blacksmith, a school-teacher. 
These should be bold outline sketches, without the neces- 
sity of memorizing anything and with freedom to invent, 
construct, and choose. The child uses his body to portray 
the characters, adding words as they help to make the por- 
trayal more vivid and more interesting. Next, animals may 
be represented, taking care to choose those which have strik- 
ing characteristics, as the lion, the polar bear, the elephant. 
In every part of the work the children are doing their own 
thinking, recalling and organizing their own experiences, 
eliminating the indefinite, and seizing upon the salient and 
important traits. In proportion as the representation is 
vivid and true to life, will the player gain the codperation 
and sympathy of his audience. These bits of portrayal evoke 
interesting comments on the part of the class, and lead to 
requests for further information about the animals or char- 
acters brought before them. Very soon the class will not 
be content with one player. The boy who is trying to repre- 
sent the monkey will suggest that he have a hand-organ 
man; the hen will want chickens; and the scene will grow 
naturally and easily without dictation from the teacher. 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
    150 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
The next step might be the portrayal of moods. The chil- 
dren will choose such subjects as a frightened girl, a lost 
child, a lazy boy, a happy child, a tardy boy, a soldier on 
duty, a rheumatic old lady. It is interesting to see how 
the children grow in power of representation and sugges- 
     
                                   
    
       tion, and how naturally language begins to be the necessary 
accompaniment of gesture in a satisfactory representation. 
The language of the children will be pictorial and full of 
unexpected turns and phrases. At this stage of the work 
it will be found helpful to put a screen between the player 
and the class. Such a device adds a little mystery to the 
play and throws the burden of interpretation upon the 
voice. The audience must rely upon the emotional quality 
of the voice in order to interpret the character. For in- 
stance, a child says, “I do not want to go out to play.” It 
depends entirely upon the tone of voice in which the words 
are said whether the class is to describe the character as 
a sick boy, a tired boy, or a sulky boy. There is a great 
opportunity here to suggest the use of new and better 
words, for the class will see the need of clear, descriptive, 
and vivid language. The effect that such work may have 
upon voice culture is most significant. The artificiality of 
the tone quality acquired by our formal reading is abso- 
lutely impossible when the feeling or desire to express 
precedes the language used. 
Tableaux organized by the children and representing phases; 
of school life, home life, historical scenes, will be found most 
effective. The emphasis here is mainly upon the position| 
and ease of the body, and the expression of the face. Chil-+ 
dren learn a degree of self-control by such adjustmen 
which reflects itself in other lines of work. The child wh 
is conscious of himself, and who is not losing himself in th 
representation of the present moment, very soon meets th
-P-A-G-E-161
  DRAMATIC EXPRESSION 151 
criticism of the class. Invite such criticism, and by keep-     
                                                       
   ing it impersonal and to the point, train the children in 
the formation of just, constructive criticisms. The oppor- 
tunity which such work offers for the questions, “ Why do 
you think so?” “How would you make the work better ? ” 
should not be omitted, for it means that later that boy or 
girl will not learn lessons by rote without question or 
reasoning. The tableaux chosen should spring from the 
school work, or represent scenes which are vividly present 
to the children, — The School Garden, A Reading Lesson, 
The Playground, A Picnic in the Woods; or more seri- 
ous subjects, — The Eskimos at Work, Hiawatha and his 
Brothers, The Pilgrims’ Sunday, etc. Many of the national 
holidays lend themselves to tableau representations. 
After the experience gained by the representation of 
such character sketches and moods, the children will be 
ready to undertake stories with simple plot. The beginning 
of plot will be found in the stories of Mother Goose. The 
value of the Mother Goose representations lies chiefly in 
the simplicity of plot, for unless the story is exceedingly 
simple and easily remembered, the children cannot form a 
mental picture vivid enough to portray. Children are ready 
to listen to many beautiful stories which they could not 
possibly play. They are able to get general impressions 
and suggestions which are invaluable from stories whose 
plot and incidents they could not put into form. But when 
a child is asked to represent a character, or to play a series 
of incidents, they must be as familiar as his own name, 
so that he may lose himself in the representation, and not 
spend his energy trying to recall what to do next. It is 
ecause the stories are not sufficiently familiar or suffi- 
iently organized that the children frequently show a lack 
f enthusiasm in their representation. A young teacher
-P-A-G-E-162
  152 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
recently said, “The children I have must be different from 
others; they do not respond to the dramatic work, but 
stand up awkwardly with nothing to say.” Upon investi- 
gation it was found that the little people in question had 
been asked to take part in stories which had only been told 
them once, and which were too complex for them to handle. 
Of course they had nothing to say. It was like exploring 
         
                    
     
     
   
   a new country, and there was no familiar path upon which 
to walk. They had enjoyed the stories, and undoubtedly 
gained impressions, but playing a story is like drawing a 
diagram: every detail must be clear; a hazy, indefinite 
impression cannot be put into tangible form. But such 
difficulties only testify to the value of the work; we are 
working for definite images, and perfect mental control; 
the dramatic work makes it possible to find out just how 
clear children’s images are, and to set them right in their 
thinking. When the simple stories of Mother Goose were 
offered to the children referred to, and they were given a 
chance to represent something which was vividly pictorial, 
they became the most enthusiastic workers, showing a desire 
to dramatize everything in which they were interested. 
© Children should not be asked to memorize parts. Such 
work is not constructive or creative, and therefore of little 
value. If dramatizing is memorizing, then let the children 
store their minds with beautiful bits of poetry, exquisite 
: in their form and feeling. Dramatic work is imaginative 
interpretation, and therefore the burden must rest upon| 
the child himself. 
In taking up the dramatization of stories, if a plan o 
z work is followed, there will be a gradual transition fro: 
« pantomime, tableaux, and portrayal of mood, to dialogue: 
and easy dramatic plots. The story chosen should hay 
abundant action, and divide itself naturally into consecutiv
-P-A-G-E-163
DRAMATIC EXPRESSION 153 
parts. The teacher should have a definite synopsis of the 
story clearly’ in mind, —a beginning, a middle, and an 
end. She should, by discussion with the children, divide 
the story into these parts, so that the sequence of events 
will be held clearly in mind. A skeleton of the story may 
be written on the blackboard, so that the unnecessary and 
nonrepresentable parts may be eliminated before there is 
any attempt to portray them. It should be possible to write 
in two or three sentences a synopsis of a story suitable for 
little children to play. In the process of organization which 
precedes the playing the teacher may say to the children, 
“When the story opens, in Part One, who is present?” 
She may then name and write these characters on the 
board. ‘“ Who is the first person to appear?” “ What is 
she doing when the story opens?” ‘What does she look 
like?” With simple questioning the story is recalled, and 
reviewed with enthusiasm and motive. “If you were the 
Old Woman in the Shoe [or whatever character the child 
is to play], what would you do when the story opens?” 
Get several children to try, and then ask the class which 
was the best Old Woman. They will give fine points of in- 
terpretation, mentioning clear voice, face to the audience, 
looked like the picture in the book, etc. In such a prepa- 
ration lies the value of the work. The story is construc- 
tively organized, and all the class is working together. The 
teacher must, however, enter into the work. She must be 
expressive and suggestive. For instance, some child por- 
trays the wolf in “Little Red Riding Hood.” Perhaps he 
is not very expressive, and his representation is not vivid. 
Here is the teacher’s opportunity to throw the work open to 
the class, and to ask some one else: “ Were you very much 
afraid of that wolf?” “Well, what could you do to make 
us more afraid?” “How could you make yourself look 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
ee ee a Re rt en ee ee ee ee 
154 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL * 
more like a wolf?” “Can you think of anything to say 
that will make the story better?” The children will be 
only too happy to volunteer suggestions, and in this way 
the work is kept a growing conception. The analysis of the 
story is constructive, not destructive, and is based upon the 
children’s own experience and imagination. The work is 
kept childlike, creative, and original. 
As the stories are played the children become lost in the 
characters and forget all question of sex. When some big, 
overgrown boy asks naively, “ May I be the mother?” let 
him, without comment. Character and action are sexless, 
and it is interpretation of these that interests the children. 
They are, for the time being, not boys and girls, but fathers, 
mothers, fairies, witches, and gnomes. The children are sim- 
ply projecting character upon a screen, that they may see it 
more clearly. 
Sometimes in giving plays the children will suggest other 
parts; for instance, some child will say, “Did n’t the boy in 
the story have a father too?” or “ Was there only one per- 
son at home when the fairy came ?” When the suggestions 
are natural, and do not interfere with the construction of 
the story, there is no reason why the children should not 
have the added pleasure of playing another part. They will 
frequently make very suggestive additions which increase 
the attractiveness of the play. 
It is well to allow a child to take the part which seems 
to appeal to him,‘but there is also a chance to encourage 
helpful codperation. The children may learn to hold. the 
success of the play above personal gratification. A bash- 
ful child should never be forced to take part in the plays. 
If he is left to himself, he will soon ask for a part. The 
most timid child rarely withholds himself more than a 
few days, and by a little tactful planning on the part of  
-P-A-G-E-165
  
DRAMATIC EXPRESSION 155 
the teacher characters will be assigned where they will 
do the most good. 
As to the question of costume, some slight addition to 
the ordinary dress will be found to be more suggestive than 
an elaborate make-up. A cap, a sword, a drum, a wand, a 
walking stick, a shawl, a doll, an apron, will give the needed 
touch. The children should be allowed to make these bits 
of costume during the handwork period. A general prop- 
erty box should be kept in the room and its contents added 
to gradually in the most economical way. A “ Mystery 
House” for puppet shows might also be built. 
The puppet play is a lost art which the primary schools 
could well restore to childhood. The wonderful educational 
and recreational possibilities of the puppet are as yet un- 
touched. Children take a keen delight in miniature repro- 
~ ductions of life. They are attracted and compelled to 
interest by moving objects, which they immediately endow 
with life. The puppet play is irresistibly fascinating to 
children because it combines motion with a suggestive re- 
production of the human form, voice, and mimic gesture. 
The tiny, grotesque figures which look up from behind the 
curtain are so crude and flexible that each child may give 
free play to his imagination and endow these miniature men 
with a personality in keeping with his own temperament 
and experience. The curtain helps, too, by adding an air of 
mystery to the source from which these tiny people come, 
and their coming and going is so humorously abrupt that 
every child attends, while the elemental emotions of wonder, 
curiosity, imitation, fear, love, joy, humor, are aroused in a 
crude form of drama which is profoundly childlike. 
The puppet show should be revived along with folk 
songs and traditional games, for “it has been acted and 
written and sung into the lives of the great and lowly, 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
  156 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
the rich and poor, of all climes and nationalities.” The 
play was started by Silvio Fiorillo before the vintagers of 
southern Italy in 1640. In an article on “ The Most Popu- 
lar Play in the World,” by Ernest Russell (Outing, January, 
1908), we read, “In England the puppet play followed 
the mystery plays,” and was used as “a side show for 
circuses, a traveling amusement, an entertainment in the 
convent, on the street, and at evening gatherings.” These 
puppet shows have been in operation nearly three hundred 
years and appear as Punch in England and America, 
Punchinello in Italy, Polichinelle in France, Hanswurst in 
Germany, and Pickelhering in Holland. Even the sternest 
of us must admit that those fundamental emotional experi- 
ences which have appealed through long ages to the folk 
soul find a subtle response in our own nervous make-up. 
The tears and laughter of the race start from our own eyes, 
and the puppet show will continue to delight all children 
till their very instincts decay. 
Aside from the delight, the puppet show may be of 
pedagogical utility to the elementary school. It may be 
usedto advantage in the reproduction of stories, dialogues, 
and current events which it is desirable to emphasize. The 
reproduction is so simple that the children may work up 
programs of their own. This will encourage constructive 
thinking and the use of good English. The children can 
easily make all the paraphernalia needed, for the construc- 
tion of the puppets, curtains, etc. is quite within their man- 
ual skill and will furnish excellent opportunities for the 
handwork. Pumpkin, gourd, or almost any rotund vege- 
table lends itself to puppet life. Take the most common- 
place potato, make a crude face on it, wrap a bit of cloth 
about it, insert the finger in a hole made in one end, and lo, 
the potato becomes fascinatingly human and will bow and

jig and talk at your own discretion! The little group who 
are so intently looking and listening in the illustration 
give evidence of the power of the puppet play to command 
concentrated attention. 
‘\ It will be found that the success of all dramatic work 
epends upon the degree of organization with which the 
aoe are attacked, and the freedom and spontaneity with 
which the children are encouraged to interpret character and 
action. The playing of the stories can be made the most 
serious work of the day, and there are endless opportunities 
for reading, writing, spelling, and language lessons in con- 
nection with it. The word “play” has frightened a great 
X many educators, but we are beginning to realize that the 
play spirit is the art spirit, and that the hardest work is often 
the most delightful. Play with little children is a mood, a 
method of attack, and has little to do with energy or effort, 
except that a child puts forth his best effort when he is in 
a playful, happy, creative mood.

CHAPTER XI 
PHONICS AND SPEECH 
The recent science of experimental phonetics as repre- 
sented by Dr. E. W. Scripture introduces a new theory of 
voice production. His method of curing stutterers and 
stammerers reénforces the necessity for intelligent care and 
control of children’s voices during the early school period. 
It emphasizes the prevention of the formation of bad habits 
of speech, so that their cure will be made unnecessary. 
According to this theory of voice production “ the larynx, 
containing the two vocal lips, which open and shut by com- 
pression, omits a series of puffs of air so fast that the puffs 
make a tone. The puffs from the larynx strike a blow on 
the air of the vocal cavities, chest, nose, and throat, etc., and 
set it in vibration. These vocal cavities have soft walls and 
are adjusted to certain tones for each vowel. The vibra- 
tions correspond to the sizes and shapes of the cavities.” 
“The pitch of the laryngeal tone is determined by the de- 
gree of tension of the vocal cords. To vary the pitch the 
laryngeal muscles must be freely and delicately poised and 
must act readily and accurately.” These cords, says Scrip- 
ture, “must be trained to emit such forms of explosion as 
will produce the best effect upon the ear.” 
The theory of voice production once established, and the 
necessity for training the vocal cords to emit sounds pleasur- 
able to the ear admitted, the next question is, “ What is the 
most economical way to secure a well-trained speaking voice 
to the young children we are helping to educate?” 
159
-P-A-G-E-170
  160 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Dr. Scripture gives three causes of speech defect: (1) 
excessive innervation of the speech organs; (2) deficient 
innervation of the speech organs, which he terms sub- 
energetic phonation ; and (3) defects in the speech organs 
themselves. 
There is no greater educational sin of the present day 
than the absolute disregard which we show in our schools 
to the quality and beauty of the speaking voice. The aver- 
age classroom is as offensive to the ear as it sometimes is to 
the nose, and the average teacher is equally insensible to 
both. We all recognize that a good, clean-cut, expressive 
voice is a great asset and goes far toward personal power, 
and yet we are turning out armies of young people to whom 
it is unpleasant to listen. We are as a nation famous for a 
flat, nasal, sluggish tone which robs the best language of its 
force. The evolution of the human voice marks a victory for 
man; his voice is the instrument of power which places him 
above the brute. Shall we then be so concerned with the 
accumulation of facts that we disregard our birthright and 
become content with signs and grunts? The schools are 
zealously teaching the boy to write, long before he needs 
that technical power, and are forgetting how much more de- 
pendent that boy is upon the control and convincing power 
of his speaking voice. 
When considering the problem of the value of phonetic 
drill in the school, its use as a mere aid to reading may be 
utterly disregarded. The purpose of phonetic drill has a 
deeper and more significant meaning. It is of inestimable 
value for four other reasons: (1) ear training, (2) clear 
enunciation, (3) breath control, (4) the discovery and cor- 
rection of speech defects. 
The cases of superenergetic phonation, or excessive in- 
nervation of the speech organs, are comparatively few in
-P-A-G-E-171
  
PHONICS AND SPEECH 161 
the schools. The process of cure involves gaining control 
over each one of the vocal organs, and in serious cases 
needs the attention of a specialist. But the problem with 
which phonetic drill has to do is that of subenergetic pho- 
nation, common to nine tenths of the pupils. We all know 
that children with perfectly healthy vocal machinery have 
unpleasant voices. Why? Because they constantly hear 
unpleasant tones; because their standards are low, and 
there is no ideal of beauty of tone set for them to imitate. 
Phonetic drill, then, should awaken an ear conscience, and 
no teacher should be permitted to victimize a whole room- 
ful of children by pouring into their ears a volume of ugly 
tone. One of her requirements should be a good, clear, ex- 
pressive speaking voice. Children are more sensitive and 
more easily reached through the ear than in any other way, 
and the secret of a teacher’s influence is often the flexibility 
and beauty of her voice. 
The voice reflects the character and habitual attitude 
of the individual. A pure tone is dependent upon health, 
breath control, emotional attitude, imitation, and the physi- 
cal formation of the speech organs. We are forced to admit, 
then, that we may not leave the voice to a natural develop- 
ment, but that education must step in with its ounce of 
prevention. One must preserve the power of deep breathing, 
and secure flexibility of tongue, jaws, and lips, ete., in order 
to make the emission of a pure, clear tone possible. Just 
as the careful and frequent cleaning of the teeth prevents 
decay and preserves the natural mouth, so breath control 
and flexibility keep the vocal organs in trim to do their 
work smoothly and effectively. 
But it is asked: “Will not a child breathe naturally 
without instruction ? Why make him conscious of his 
organs ? Nature will take care to regulate them.” Nature 
 
-P-A-G-E-172
  
  162 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
is already overburdened in this artificial life we lead. The 
ill-ventilated room is a destroyer of deep breathing. The 
system is protected against impurity by the child’s refusal 
to let the foul air into the lungs except in sufficient quan- 
tities to preserve life. A kind of panting is substituted for 
natural breathing, and the necessary function of inhalation 
and expansion is inhibited. 
Now the voice is dependent upon breath control. The 
vowels which we use are made by sustained open columns 
of air; the consonants — the messengers of the sound 
world to carry the vowels to their destination — are made 
by obstructing these columns of air with the lips, tongue, 
teeth, etc. The lips, tongue, and teeth of the individual 
child may be in good order, but unless he can control the 
column of air, they are of little use in securing a good clear 
speaking voice. Before orderly, even speech is possible, 
there must be a liberal supply of air drawn into the lungs, 
and the speaker must know how to control its output. 
Another cause for subenergetic phonation is the lack of 
emotional tone, enthusiasm, and vigor. We frequently find 
a fresh young voice in an old body, and the voice will 
remain fresh, clear, buoyant, so long as it has behind it 
such an attitude toward life. The human voice is flexible in 
proportion as it identifies itself with human feeling. The 
indifferent, careless, joyless individual expresses his color- 
less experiences in a flat, sluggish tone. The schools with 
their formalism and dull repetition are creating a peculiar 
schoolroom tone which is untidy, nasal, and spiritless. The 
artificial reading and concert work of the early grades pitch 
the voices of our young into a loud monotone to be molded 
into a habitual and unconscious drawl in the upper grades. 
We are learning that free lunches and medical inspection, 
by raising the physical tone of the children in the grades,
-P-A-G-E-173
  
PHONICS AND SPEECH 163 
increase the volume and improve the quality of the voice, 
but we must now learn that feeling and mood are at the 
basis of melody and flexibility. 
By means of delicate instruments the voice of a speaker 
or singer can be caught by the phonograph or the gramo- 
phone, and then transferred to strips of paper for closer 
study, in the form of visible vibrations which are represented 
by curves. Experiment has shown that there are distinct

modifications of these speech curves dependent upon the 
emotion of the speaker. There is what Dr. Scripture calls 
a “melody plot” in every vocal expression, even in the 
utterance of a simple sound like “Oh!” and this plot 
varies decidedly with each emotion (Figs. 32 and 33). 
The “ melody cure” is being used to correct stammering 
and stuttering. “By putting melody and flexibility, rise 
and fall, into the vocal utterance of persons with such 
speech defects, new speech habits are formed, ease and 
fluency are acquired, and the old compulsive fear which

    164 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
inhibits speech and cramps the muscles of the larynx is 
driven out.” The stutterer speaks in a characteristic mo- 
notonous manner, represented in Fig. 34. He is cured when 
he learns to say “Good morning!” with melodious modu- 
lation, as shown in Fig. 35. 
This melody idea should be made use of in phonetic 
drills to establish free, flexible tones ‘which produce pleas- 
ant effects upon the ear. Children love to play “echo”; the 
teacher says a phrase, in any form or intonation she chooses, 
and the children give it back in soft, smooth, echo fashion, 
preserving the same inflection. She can give three or four 
interpretations to such a simple sentence as “Come in.” 
That is, she may say “Come in” in many moods. It may

represent a call to people in the distance, a command, a 
hospitable invitation, joy, excitement, surprise, — thus giv- 
ing the class the opportunity for unconscious imitation of 
melodious, flexible speech. The device is a simple one, but 
gives the incentive for close attention and precise imitation 
in a happy, childlike mood. 
The problem of ear training and voice culture is a serious 
one. The majority of our public-school children have never 
heard the English language in its purity. They do not 
pronounce their ¢’s and d’s, nor make use of round, pure 
vowels, because they have never heard them; or because 
they have acquired a lazy habit of keeping the jaws rigid 
and of holding the teeth close together. The language con- 
science should be awakened in the lower grades, so that
-P-A-G-E-175
PHONICS AND SPEECH 165 
the children will stop their ears to an unpleasant speaking 
tone, as they will to the shrill whistle of a locomotive. 
Voice culture must come through the ear, and it can 
be brought about only by unconscious imitation of pure 
sound, presented in a playful, suggestive way. Primary 
children are in an imitative, playful, language-building 
period, and therefore such work in voice culture belongs 
to the earlier grades. This training is a thousand times 
of words. It is, 
after all, oral composition, and oral composition is what we more valuable than the conscious analysis 
  need, — face-to-face, direct, and intelligent communication 
of thought in a clear, natural tone. The distressing quan- 
tity of written work, out of proportion in the first grade 
and fairly swamping our normal and high schools, utterly 
disregards the crying need of our young people for ac- 
ceptable oral presentation. There should be a reformation 
throughout the elementary school which would establish a 
belief that the power to talk well must precede the power 
to write well. 
Let us admit, then, that there are serious local causes 
for the unpleasant voices characteristic of our land, and let 
phonetic drill help to eliminate them. In every school 
where there is artificial reading, and lack of joy, interest, 
and emotional response; where teachers with colorless 
voices compel harmful imitation, and absence of good fresh 
air prevents wholesome breathing; where concert work 
fostering loudness, not quality of tone, prevails, — there 
will be found the natural causes for grave offenses against 
pure tone quality and clear enunciation. 
Children are instinctively interested in sound. They 
amuse themselves when alone by repeating over and over 
again sounds which interest them, irrespective of their 
meaning. Why not lay hold of this instinctive tendency
-P-A-G-E-176
166 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
to educate the sound sense as you do the color or num- 
ber sense? If one may not have a separate period for 
phonetic drill, use the game period for exercises like the 
following. 
Give the children directions to do certain things; as, 
“Close the door,” “ Open the desk,” etc., —using the lips 
only and without uttering a sound. What will happen ? 
Every eye will be focused upon the teacher’s mouth, so 
that the children will begin to see how the vowels and 
consonants which they hear are made. Unconscious imi- 
tation will set in and help them to place their own vocal 
organs in proper position when they in turn are permitted 
to give the directions. For instance, enunciating clearly 
but without vocalization, say, “ Touch your head,” “ Clasp 
your hands,” “ Open your mouth,” ete. Some of the children 
will for the first time in their lives realize that “ sit” has 
at at the end of it, “head” a d; for they have never heard 
the words except in a careless, slurring fashion. 
Again, children love to imitate sounds, and there are 
many which they hear every day which can be made use of 
in a game. The child who plays is to impersonate some 
animal or thing, and may make known what he is only 
by some characteristic sound. When you say “ Who and 
what are you,” he will reply, moo, or coo, or sss, sh, ch, etc., 
meaning “ cow,” “dove,” “snake,” “skyrocket,” “ engine.” 
Now comes the teacher’s opportunity to introduce new 99 ee 29 ee, 
and difficult sounds which require prolonged vowel con- 
trol, quick, direct consonant drill, and sustained breathing. 
This work may grow in complexity until the repetition of 
difficult bits of rime and alliteration are mastered, and fail- 
ures of speech control in individual children noted, without 
undue consciousness. Playing “echo,” as described above, 
is another device which may be used in this connection. 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
PHONICS AND SPEECH 167 
Work of this character may be followed by a session 
with “ Mother Goose.” Much of the charm of ‘“ Mother 
Goose” is due to its abundant rime. Children listen at- 
tentively to recurring accent, and begin to get a feeling for 
the rhythm of language. Train the children to listen for 
and recognize sounds that are alike. “Jack and Jill went 
up the hill; Jack fell down and broke his crown.” This 
exercise is at first merely for the recognition of rimes, 
and the children may hold up their hands when they hear 
words that sound alike. The next step is to let the chil- 
dren do the riming. “I am thinking of a word that sounds    
   
     
                                     
    
    
   like rake, — what do you think of ?” Place the words 
presented by the children under one another, so that they 
will see that the initial consonant makes the difference in 
the meaning, and that the body of the words is constant. 
Now these words may be pronounced in a whisper quickly, 
with the teacher as a model to imitate. If the game spirit 
is preserved, and flexibility and response set at a premium, 
the results are excellent. 
Consonants should not be separated from words and 
vocalized. Such an exercise gives a child a very false idea 
of phonetic values. There is no such thing in the English lan- 
guage as duh, puh, muh, —as d, and p, and m are ordinarily 
pronounced. .Consonants mean merely the placing of the 
vocal organs in position. They are the triggers of speech ; 
set the trigger, and when it falls it will release the vowel 
nd send it to its journey’s end. For consonant drill let the 
hildren imitate the position of the teacher’s vocal organs, 
nd quickly say a word beginning with the consonant the 
symbol of which has been previously written on the board. 
long list, as “bad,” “boy,” “beg,” “burst,” “big,” 
“body,” “bean,” “baby,” will be mentioned by the chil- 
ren, who will be made conscious of the fact that all these 
 
-P-A-G-E-178
  168 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
words begin with 6, and that it is necessary to place the 
vocal organs in a certain position before it is possible to say 
words that do begin with 6. The consonants are absolutely 
disfigured by being separated from the vowels which they 
emphasize and vocalize. The analysis of words into self- 
conscious, separate sounds will undoubtedly bring on inhi- 
bition and speech defects. A recent report of the public 
   
   
   
   
                              
    
   schools of Boston calls artificial phonetic instruction the 
breeding ground of stuttering and stammering. The beauty 
of speech lies in a smoothness, fluidity, and lack of hesitation 
which cannot be acquired by analysis, but by unconscious 
and skillful imitation of pure words. 
In the riming which has been suggested and the arrange- 
ment of words with similar endings in columns, the neces- 
sary aid to reading can be given and yet the emphasis be laid 
upon melody and sound values. All the word endings — 
as end, and, ind, ate, ite, ake, ight — may be taught in this 
way, serving the double purpose of insuring the quick 
recognition of words and the opportunity for effective 
sound drill. The words which end alike may be put into 
short sentences vibrating with action and full of interpretive 
interest, so that the oral reproduction of them will be full 
of melody and flexibility. The learning of word endings| 
should, however, be merely an accompaniment of phonetic 
drill, and not an end in itself. The purpose of phonies in| 
the schools is not to reduce reading to a mechanical process, 
but to serve as a means of voice culture. 
The compiling of dictionaries in connection with th 
phonetic work is an interesting and special help in read 
ing and spelling. Make a book in the handwork period 
put at the top of each page one of these endings, — and] 
end, ate, etc.; let the children enter words studied accord 
ing to their respective endings. Sound values will soor
-P-A-G-E-179
PHONICS AND SPEECH 169 
become conscious to the children without any harmful 
analysis of words. 
Perhaps a few suggestions for improving breath control 
will not be out of place: 
Let the children try to blow out an imaginary candle. 
They will take a natural breath and then send it out in one 
explosive effort. The imaginary candle which the teacher 
holds in her hand in front of the class may be held at dif- 
ferent distances, so that the amount of breath ae into 
the body will be increased. 
Let them play that they hold a four-o’clock in their hands, 
and try to blow all the feathery down off at one expiration. 
They may play that they hold pin wheels in their hands, 
and in order to keep them going smoothly round and round, 
must take a long breath and then send it out slowly and 
evenly. This even control of the breath is exactly what is 
needed in effective speech, and this simple exercise offers 
training in breath control with a motive and without mak- 
ing speech self-conscious. 
To get the same exercise, the children will enjoy play- 
ing that there is a feather floating in the air just above 
their heads, and they must keep it up in the air by blowing 
upon it. 
To imitate a tired dog panting gives an opportunity for 
a succession of explosive breaths, decreasing in volume 
until the breath drawn in has been exhausted. 
Such devices may sound very simple to those who are 
afraid of the word “play” in the classroom, but to play that 
a thing is so means to imagine it so, and children’s imag- 
inations are so active and vigorous that there is nothing 
forced or conscious in the exercises suggested. If one tries 
to lead the children to take a long, deep breath simply by 
saying in a formal way, “ Now take a long breath,” the
-P-A-G-E-180
  
  170 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
children swell up like little porpoises, and the distention is 
entirely forced, without developing the natural control of 
breath. It is surprising to see how few children expand 
their lungs naturally, or make use of their proper lung 
capacity in breathing. Such failure is due, as has been sug- 
gested, to the artificial conditions in the schools and in the 
homes, and it is a failure which needs the attention of 
every intelligent worker in the field of education. 
These phonetic exercises may be termed technical, but 
surely they are far less so than the technicalities of read- 
ing and writing which are being forced without hesitation 
upon the children in the primary school. Technicalities 
of pure speech should precede those of the written or 
printed page. : 
There are good opportunities for preventive work here. 
Hundreds of thousands of youths and adults are now 
suffering from serious speech defects, which originated in 
childhood and were then most easily remediable. Primary 
teachers are dealing with this childhood age when the speech 
habits are still plastic. They can do something to prevent 
the serious defects in the few, and still more to correct 
in the many the milder defects of slurring and deforming 
vowels and consonants. With the speaking voice, as with 
many other things, there is a normal standard, which is 
distinctly above the prevailing average. 
Thought, whether written or spoken, depends upon emo- 
tion, or feeling, and takes on rhythmical form in its expres- 
sion. Little children are sensitive to rhythm, and therefore 
the habits of easy, rhythmical, flowing speech should be 
established during the instinctive, language-building period 
of child life. The schools should not consume the time of 
the children by preparing them for some distant future 
when they will need to read and write, but should fit them
-P-A-G-E-181
  
PHONICS AND SPEECH Ath 
for a happy present in which they need, every hour that 
they live, to make use of their voices in natural communi- 
cation with their neighbors. Children are thinking all the 
time, and if oral expression of thought were made attractive 
and esthetic, there would be more interest in reading re- 
corded thought. Most people would learn to read, even if 
the schools were abandoned; and if they waited to attack 
the reading problem until they were mature, they would 
probably read more fluently and intelligently. Speech is 
absolutely necessary from babyhood on, and children will 
imitate what they hear. Speech habits are bound to be 
formed at an early day, and if they are incorrect ones, it will 
be almost impossible to break them. No individual, in what- 
ever walk of life, can afford to be deprived of the power 
and influence which go with a strong, clear speaking voice, 
full of melody and flexibility.
-P-A-G-E-182
  CHAPTER XII 
LANGUAGE 
Language cannot be taught, but must be evoked. Speech 
is the incarnation of feeling and thought. The theme and 
melody of a bit of music are present in the composer’s mind 
before he communicates them by means of notation. The 
notes are only a clumsy representation of the artist’s more 
intimate ideas and feelings. So it is with words, which are 
merely the signs of previously conceived ideas. Ideas spring 
from experience ; the more varied the experience the larger 
the stock of usable ideas. 
Language grows out of the social instinct, and where 
this instinct is dead, as it is in most schools, language too 
will be lifeless. When there is desire, speech comes nat- 
urally, but a negative, formal schoolroom attitude stifles 
desire. Man has a language capacity, but life and school 
must provide an opportunity for its development. 
The language of a nation is constantly growing, not by 
any fixed laws of increase, but in sympathy with new con- 
ditions. New objects, new discoveries, new ideas, demand 
new words. The language of a child is like that of a nation. 
The listless, idle, overdocile child is not creating new images 
which will cry for words to clothe them. Little children 
are in the language-making period. They have keen ears 
to catch fine intonations, and sharp eyes with which to ob- 
serve new facts; and yet language in the primary grades 
is usually as formal as the orthodox butler, and as unorgan- 
ized as the tin man in the “ Wizard of Oz.” Language is 
172
-P-A-G-E-183
    
LANGUAGE 173 
a tool which must not only be preserved from rust, but 
must be sharpened to do its work with precision and effect, 
that thought may be expressed with freedom, clearness, 
and correctness. 
Children are poets, and the stimulus they need for the 
development of poetic expression is direct contact with na- 
ture. They need to come upon surprises, unexpected like- 
nesses, and alluring lights and shadows. Then language 
takes on vividness and beauty. Outdoor life stirs the chil- 
dren intellectually too, and by constantly presenting prob- 
lems for solution it creates a fund of new ideas. These 
problems are to be solved in terms of comparison and con- 
trast which arise out of live conditions and concrete ex- 
periences. Out of this first-hand contact will come nouns, 
  adjectives, and apt phra The child of the outdoors 
will naturally say “as gay as a dandelion,” “as black as a 
cloud”’; or, as a little five-year-old boy said when he looked 
at his uncle’s rough, mottled gray suit, “That makes you 
look like a horned toad.” 
Language owes much to the startling beauty of nature, 
and children are more alive to the wonder, mystery, and 
newness of life than any one else. They are ready to ac- 
cumulate the impressions, the raw material out of which 
they will fashion their happiest conceptions. Unconsciously 
the beauty and suggestion of life surges in upon them, and 
their hearts are overflowing with joy. From a full heart 
language is born. The morose and somber are silent, but 
the joyous needs must speak. 
Children’s vocabulary will grow naturally if they live in 
a suggestive environment. They should be allowed to hear 
the stroke of the hammer in the workshop, to feel the soft- 
ness of the pussycat’s coat, to see the blue of the sky, to 
taste the honey in the cups of the flowers, and to smell
-P-A-G-E-184
    174 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
the pungent fall odors. The great Creator gave the childa 
voice, but it is a mere instrument of expression upon which 
experience, imagination, and joy must play. The strings of 
a harp will be silent without the stroke of the fingers, the 
voice without the push of desire. 
Language lessons are frequently as ineffectual as our 
attempts to write to a friend with whom we have long been 
out of touch. What is there to say ? — we have no words 
because we have no ideas which compel communication. 
If you would foster the gift of language in the children, 
throw out the commonplace classroom expressions, and 
introduce variety and imagination into your own. speech. 
Make the sensory life of the child a rich fild from which 
he may glean striking comparisons, and stir his imagina-   
tion to make use of them in attacking new ideas. Begin by 
changing your morning greeting, — find out in how many 
ways you can make the children welcome and begin the 
day ; feast their ears upon a variety of clear, musical Eng- 
lish; give them “Mother Goose” with its quaint descrip- 
tions and humorous turns; let them listen to fairy tale 
and fable, that they may enlarge their vocabulary and 
make friends of new words. 
Language is not speech alone ; it is the communication 
of ideas. ] These may be communicated by drawing, mod- 
eling, and handwork, which should be kept in close rela- 
tion to the language work. The dramatic play of the school 
is coming to the rescue of the language teacher also, for 
thought is communicated by gesture as well as by voice. 
Children are in the pantomime and gesture stage. They 
should be encouraged to put their bodies into action and 
the facial muscles into expressive use. Away with stolidity 
and orthodox position if you would have the children learn 
to talk well! 
 
-P-A-G-E-185
LANGUAGE 175 
Tf the children are allowed to talk naturally and freely, 
their language will be figurative, for personification is child- 
like. Children believe in their own fancies. Apparent like- 
nesses and accidental associations are facts to them, which 
call out quaint and original expression. Children are impres- 
sionable and emotional, and their images are strong because 
they grow out of first-hand contact with life in its new- 
ness and mystery. See to it, then, that the school environ- 
ment does not limit the contact of the children to prosaic 
books and ugly desks. Make room for the instinctive reac- 
tions toward elemental things,— earth, air, water, fire,— and 
their language will be vigorous and effective. Mere object 
teaching as a substitute for such intimate experiences as have 
been suggested is a delusion. The child who makes a formal 
sentence about an orange, a book, a pencil, held up before 
the group for inspection, is only giving the result of a per- 
functory visual contact which is superficial and stultifying. 
There are many types of successful language lessons, 
for which nature study, game life, and daily happenings 
furnish suggestive themes. These topics, however, must be 
presented in the form of problems, and developed by a few 
leading questions which quicken curiosity and stimulate 
thinking. The primary school is not nearly as progressive 
as it would have the world believe. Children are still 
memorizing symbols, only we have cunningly substituted 
words and sentences instead of syllables. It is the solution 
of problems that we need. Constructive thinking which 
makes some demand upon originality will develop personal 
power, but the dictated exercises and memory gems of the 
primary school call for neither constructive thinking nor 
imagination. The wordiness of the early grades accounts 
for the lack of initiative and power of individual attack 
which we complain of in the grammar school.
-P-A-G-E-186
    176 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Following are some suggestions for language work. The 
suggestions are simple and are intended to arouse better 
ones in the minds of those who read them. 
1. Bring to school pictures which invite discussions and 
admit of original interpretation with interesting descriptive 
details. Do not choose pictures which merely represent 
the power of the artist’s technique, but seize upon those 
which excite the imagination and invite speculation as to 
their meaning. 
2. Make use of the study of mountain, park, seashore, 
or bit of local history. Allow the children to make imagi- 
nary trips to some of these favorite haunts. They may 
represent to the class where they have been by pantomime, 
or by telling in direct, descriptive sentences what they 
have seen or heard. Probably a child will choose a trip to 
the mountains as his topic. Perhaps he will say something 
like the following, which represents the description of a 
certain first-grade boy: “I took a trip one day. I went a 
long way from home. I took my dog and my father car- 
ried his gun. I saw trees and pretty running water. I 
waded in the cool water. I climbed up, up, up. Where do 
you think I went?” Did not that child gain power and 
discretion in the use of words? Is not this a more vital 
recitation than the repetition of something which he had 
learned by heart ? 
These guessing games are very useful and may be ap- 
plied in many ways. Children love to describe things which 
they have seen, heard, or touched. Sometimes the problem 
will be to describe a moving object, and they may choose 
a wagon hauling some load, a train coming into the sta- 
tion, or, as one child did, a fly crawling over the window- 
pane. Such exercises will result in the most graphic and 
interesting descriptions of animals, houses, trains, toys,
-P-A-G-E-187
  
LANGUAGE Lat 
fruits, flowers, and trees. You will be surprised at the origi- 
nality shown, and the precision of expression gained. Of 
course the teacher must direct the work and lead the chil- 
dren to organize what they have to say, before appearing in 
front of the group, and to pick out the large, characteristic 
things to describe. 
3. Keep the language lessons pictorial. This is very 
easily done when the children are drawing at the board. 
Give them the written symbols for the objects which they 
have drawn, and let them write these symbols under their 
pictures. After a little practice the younger children will 
pass from the mere enumeration of objects drawn, to de- 
scriptive sentences about the picture as a whole. They 
will write very terse and illuminating remarks, and through 
such experiences make an easy transition to the regular 
written work of the school. 
4. Let the children read very simple stories; select the 
ones that can be illustrated. The reading should be done 
silently, and the sentences copied and illustrated. Chil- 
dren enjoy such a problem, and like to preserve the stories 
in book form. 
5. Language games for emphasizing correct forms of 
speech are, of course, recommended. The danger is that the 
2 ee child who is saying “seen,” “done,” and “git” may be put 
through a series of games to teach him to say precociously, 
“It was not I.” If language games are forced, they lose 
spontaneity and informality and miss their whole point, ~ 
—which is to bring about a frequent, natural, and con- 
versational use of certain necessary phrases. If these games 
are to be formal, it were better to drop them from the 
course of study, and insert the old technical instruction in 
the forms of speech which they have replaced. Language 
needs informal atmosphere.
-P-A-G-E-188
    
178 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
6. The children may be encouraged to make original 
stories to be written on the blackboard by the teacher and 
finally read by the class. New words will be frequently 
introduced, but they will be readily remembered because 
they are necessary to the idea which the children are trying 
to express. It is interesting and helpful to keep a list of 
these new words and to see that they are introduced again 
in reading lessons. 
The following compositions were contributed by a class 
of A 1’s, —the first after constructing an Indian village, 
and the second after a nature-study discussion. 
I 
We made an Indian Village. 
‘We made a river in the village. 
The river comes from the mountain. 
It runs down the mountain. 
It runs right in front of the Indian’s wigwam. 
The Indian likes the river. 
The river brings fish to the Indian. 
The river carries the Indian’s canoe. 
IL 
It digs in the sand. 
It cannot climb, nor fly, nor run. 
It walks very slowly. 
It carries its house with it. 
It draws its head and feet into its house. 
Then it feels quite safe. 
No, a turtle likes the water. 
It is a tortoise. 
It is interesting to note how the children who wrote 
these stories have reflected the primitive and poetic atti- 
tude toward nature. “ The river carries the Indian’s canoe, 
and brings fish to the Indian” are expressions of their con- 
ception of inanimate things, which they always endow with
-P-A-G-E-189
  LANGUAGE 179 
purpose and life. Surely such reading material is far better 
than the formal, unchildlike, and unpoetical lessons to be 
found in the first readers. Children have more instinct for 
literature than the bookmen. 
7. Some of the suggestions referred to in the account 
of dramatic work may be utilized with effect. Indeed, the 
children should not be expected during the language period 
to pass too quickly from the pantomime and pictorial stages 
of expression which make the transition to more difficult 
written work easy. 
It is a simple matter to teach the little children correct 
written form from the very beginning. The endless oppor- 
tunities to put work on the blackboard bring in the use of 
capital and punctuation marks so that the eye of the child 
may be made sensitive to form. The best time to teach the 
detail of written form is when the children contribute the 
original stories which have been referred to above. At these 
times the children give the natural phrasing which makes 
punctuation a necéssity. They ask the questions and they 
see the need of question mark and period. When an exer- 
cise is taken from a book, and written on the board with 
the punctuation marks left out,.the child has to waste time 
and energy wading through a meaningless jumble of words, 
and only the negative side of punctuation is emphasized. 
Moreover, the child is not in the mood of the paragraph, and 
so does not get the feeling for question mark or exclama- 
tion point. The work is much more constructive and helpful 
when the child punctuates as he writes, making punctuation 
the natural and habitual accompaniment of thought. 
The child should talk well before he reads well, for oral 
expression is at the foundation of all intelligent reading. 
It is necessary, therefore, to interest the children in the
-P-A-G-E-190
    180 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
simple, homely things in their environment. To accomplish 
this, assign definite problems of observation to particular 
children, and remember to ask for a three-minute report 
the following day. For instance, let a child observe a new 
building, or one in process of erection, and understand that 
he must come to school ready to tell all the items of interest 
in regard to it. The self-confidence and power aroused by 
the ability to tell a bit of information in a clear, direct way 
are invaluable. Even such a simple task requires intelligent 
organization which is constructive in character, and which 
is the very earnest of later written work. What the chil- 
dren need is the ability to talk clearly and to think con- 
nectedly. We do not need so much written work in the 
elementary school, but we do need more enthusiasm, naiveté, 
and curiosity and faith. Let the children be awakened to 
the wonder and beauty of the common world, that they 
may talk from a deep experience.

CHAPTER XIII 
HANDWORK 
“Utility” is the watchword of the twentieth century, 
and every branch of human effort must meet the. test. 
Science is no longer satisfied with mere speculation, but 
has become the willing servant of mankind. It diligently 
searches out the truth, but as persistently hunts a practical 
application of it. Education has been dragged before the 
bar and pleads guilty. In consequence it has been forced 
to throw out of its curricula a whole list of tasks which 
served no practical purpose, which merely enveloped the 
student in complacent wisdom and left him staring help- 
lessly at his fellow men. Efficiency, not information, has 
become the educational ideal. Brain and hand must work 
together’‘in the solution of life’s problems, for to be efficient, 
as has been well said, is to put thought and feeling into 
forms which will reach the thought and feeling of others. 
Little children are by nature efficient, for they are distinctly 
motor in their reactions. They turn toward construction 
instinctively, and handwork in the schools has become the 
surest means of personal expression and power. 
Children need plastic material upon which they may 
stamp their mental images. They need a medium which 
will receive and objectify their impressions. The construc- 
tive, representative instinct which the child so vigorously 
makes use of is nature’s way of helping him to balance 
mental accounts. By means of it he sifts impressions, and 
labels them for use. Use establishes intimacy, possession.

  182 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Wear a suit of clothes, and it takes on the individuality of 
the owner; use an idea, project it, give it form, and it 
becomes a personal possession. 
The child’s world is objective ; his images are based upon 
sense perceptions, and he cares for immediate and visible 
embodiment of facts. Let him register the ideas he receives 
in some form of motor discharge. Give him plenty of hand- 
work, for it will make use of the impressions of sight, sound, 
and touch under the fruitful direction of his creative imagina- 
tion. Do not be content with school work which makes use 
of the eye alone, but provide the child with forms of expres- 
sion which make a larger demand upon his sense centers. 
Give him an opportunity to codrdinate eye and hand by 
offering him work which demands their codperation. 
\Handwork gives the child an opportunity for efficiency 
in social service. }He is full of a desire to help, to contrib- 
ute something.) In his undeveloped state his service must 
be limited to the things which he can do with his hands. 
He is not capable of protracted effort, but the simplicity 
and finality of the constructive work satisfy his desire for 
direct and immediate results. Handwork wisely directed 
enables the child to contribute things of beauty and value, 
and therefore arouses a social pride. 
In school work the children need evidences of fruitful 
effort. They must struggle some time before they can feel 
their progress in reading and writing, but in handwork they 
can fairly possess success. They feel ‘the uplift of immediate 
achievement, of personal power. 
Originality of expression is the aim of hendwal eat 
originality is not ready-made. It is the result of experience 
and an accompanying increase of technique. There should 
be as definite a relation between the demand and supply of 
technique in handwork as there is between the demand and 
 
-P-A-G-E-193
  
HANDWORK 183 
supply of any commodity. The demand for technique should 
grow out of the use of a variety of suggestive material. 
Material which suggests or hints a process will make a de- 
mand upon originality and call for technique. Handwork 
may not be judged by the technical results obtained, but 
by the knowledge the child has gained of the uses and the 
possibilities of material. _ 
Handwork belongs to the realm of art.) It is intimate and 
personal in character and is a question of individual adjust- 
ment. It demands a creative atmosphere and does not thrive 
under the strict silence of the ordinary school period. Joy- 
ous human relations must surround the work done with    
   
      
     
                          
    
     
   the hands. The children should be allowed and encouraged 
to share their work with one another; to compare, discuss, 
and lend a hand. It is the child who is permitted to whirl 
the finished article in the air and invite admiration of it 
who will feel the glow of creativity. The child-who follows 
the solemn dictation of his teacher and then silently puts 
his work away has no consciousness of victory. He will 
never know the joy of the true craftsman. If some freedom 
is allowed during this period, many boys and girls will re- 
ceive the first commendation of their playmates through a 
bit of skillful handwork. This glow of success will be a 
revelation. .This concrete evidence of power will awaken 
new energy which will flow over into other lines of effort. 
What is the moral reaction from work with things ? The 
child’s ideas, thoughts, become tangibly visible. Suppose 
all thought took visible form, would it not startle some of 
hhoughts ? Wandwork must be true and clean to be worth 
hile. / A lie‘fin the concrete cannot be hidden ; it carries its 
results with it. (The child who works with his hands must 
hink, deliberate, and stand by his conclusions. \Exclusively lus to look up and see the distorted figure of our habitual: 
  terme
-P-A-G-E-194
  184 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
intellectual effort is subjective and incomplete, and may 
become selfish in its motive, but work with the hands is 
altruistic, objective, and humanizing. 
Y Do not give the children a lot of characterless objects to, 
“ make. )The standard of handwork should be use or beauty, ) 
or both. Keep the work close to the lives of the little 
people. Let them make wagons, jumping jacks, paper dolls, 
       
         
   
                  
   
     boats, and engines. Such effort will do more to establish 
honest regard for property than all the sermons you can 
deliver. Possessions, accompanied by a sense of the labor 
involved in the making, will open a new page of ethics to 
the small boy or girl. The child who makes coat hang- 
ers, tags, holders for rubbers, pencil boxes, ete. is protect- 
ing his neighbor’s property as well as his own. He is 
learning self-respect and independence by supplying his 
own wants by the work of his hands. 
Every primary room should contain a sand table upon 
which may be set up illustrative work.) Each child may 
have a part in building the farm, the Indian or the Eskimo 
village, the circus or store. Community work and a common 
responsibility establish a feeling of comradeship of which 
the schools are sorely in need. It gives an opportunity for 
just comparisons and mutual suggestions. The children will 
work in pairs or in groups of three or four, solving their 
problems independently but being obliged to conform to the| 
general purpose or plan. If the added joy of secrecy is given| 
by making something to present to another grade, the enthu 
siasm and effort of the children will pass all expectations. 
This community spirit is contagious, and boys and girl: 
from the fourth, fifth, even sixth and seventh grades, hay 
been known to make daily visits to the primary room “t 
see what the kids are making now.” The next step is t 
ask if they may contribute something. Indeed, the schoo
-P-A-G-E-195
  
HANDWORK 185 
is running over with these opportunities for codperation, 
self-help, and personal pleasure in work, but these vital, 
human aspects of life do not flourish in a silent, austere 
atmosphere. They are set going by the light of enthusiasm 
in the teacher’s eye and by the wisdom of what seems to 
be undirected effort. 
Handwork is frequently criticized because the material 
used is so expensive. This is a just criticism, and every 
teacher should make it a matter of pride to search out cheap 
material and not be content to check off long lists of costly 
stuff for the school boards to pay for. For instance, why 
order tilo-matting for the free-hand sewing when coffee 
sacking, which grocery stores sell for a song, makes a fine 
substitute ? Old kodak rolls, which the proprietors give 
away for the asking, may be used for silhouettes in free- 
hand cutting, whereas the black paper used for that pur- 
pose is very expensive. Spools, ribbons, old chalk boxes, 
newspapers, scraps of wood from the manual-training shop 
which are usually thrown out, and nature material brought 
by the children offer endless opportunities. A bottle of 
paste made of flour and water costs a few cents, while the 
bottles bought by the schools come nearer to the dollar 
mark. For large brush work with the younger children do 
not use paints, and then have all the parents asking that art 
work be omitted, but make an order of cheap dyes which 
come in all the standard colors and are easily handled. 
In many cases ordinary pasteboard will take the place of 
bristol board, and manila paper, which is cheap, may be 
adapted to a thousand purposes. 
The character of the primary work should retain the 
kindergarten flavor. The primary child is still a kinder- 
garten child, with a little more conscious purpose, with in- 
creased power of concentration, added control of material, 
 
-P-A-G-E-196
  
186 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
and a more organized imagination. His tastes and joys are 
almost identical. Give him large, coarse, flexible material ; 
let him choose the material best adapted to his work and 
have the judgment to discard what is impractical. Let ex- 
pression rather than technique be the guide in the choice 
of exercises given. Take time to let the children suggest 
how to make the object; let them discuss ways and means, 
not follow directions wholly; give the child one step in 
the process and let him figure out the next; some of the 
directions given in handwork with such precision are as 
unnecessary as lifting..a child’s feet when he climbs the 
stairs. When*similar or familiar processes are used do not 
tell them over again, but let the children apply what has 
been already learned. Seize upon occasional days for free 
work. This is best accomplished by putting a lot of sugges- 
tive material — such as boxes, spools, a variety of shapes 
and sizes of wood, paste, paper, scissors, yarn, etc. — on the 
table and allowing the children to choose what they. will. 
make, the kind of material they will use, and how they will 
make the article chosen. Even little children can make win- 
dow boxes, clay flowerpots, cages for animals, strings and 
tassels for the curtains, and many other little devices for 
the comfort and cleanliness of the schoolroom. 
Joyous, purposeful activity is the secret of honest living. 
Little children come to the school with a gift for being busy. 
The business of the schools is to transform this tendency 
into purposeful work. Children are not inherently idle or 
lazy. Idleness and laziness are the scars left by hours of 
joyless, distasteful work. So long as work is defined as 
an unwelcome task, so long will idleness increase. School 
work need not be irksome in order to be profitable, but 
should be the wholesome expression of changing tastes 
and increasing power. 
 
-P-A-G-E-197
  CHAPTER XIV 
LITERATURE 
If our modern doctrines of education were faith, not 
theory ; if we honestly believed in preserving to childhood 
its imagination, its emotional life, its ideals, and its humor, 
the so-called reading in the primary school would give 
place to the absorption of good literature.. The word “ liter- 
ature” does not take on a sufficiently clear meaning in the 
minds of teachers. We do not have it in the schools because 
we are not sure what constitutes it. A mature person has 
the privilege of exercising personal judgment in the choice 
of what he will read; he may discard what falls short of 
personal approval. A child has no such privilege ; he must 
base his standards and ideals upon the reading matter dealt 
out to him. When that reading matter is made up of the 
incongruous stuff contained in the average primer, what is 
to become of taste and discrimination ? 
Not one teacher in five hundred is bringing literature to 
little children. If she interests them she thinks all is well. 
Interest is no criterion in this connection, for a child will 
listen to almost anything put in story form. Literature is 
a question of units of thought, of taste, discrimination, and 
emotion. Much of the story work done in the grades is 
as demoralizing as vaudeville music; it is dissipating and 
cheap. We need to form standards of choice in the selec- 
tion of literature ; we need to have some convictions upon 
the subject which will guide us in our choice. Many stories 
told in the early grades are aimless jumbles of words, with 
187 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
    188 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
nothing to recommend them but a kind of sticky morality. 
They follow no preconceived plan and arrive at no ade- 
quate conclusion. Such stories arrest mental development 
by their fluid imbecility. 
How may we recognize a good bit of literature ? How 
may we determine whether a story is worth telling? 
Every good story is made up of essentials as necessary 
to its structure as bone and muscle to the human frame. 
It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. It is a series of 
related incidents, each one illuminating the other and all 
converging upon the climax. Before selecting a story, see 
whether you can write an outline of it in one or two - 
short sentences. 
Literature, like life, is made up of action —action so 
vigorous that it overcomes all obstacles in the way of its 
success. As in life, the characters in a story should be 
individual, and full of purpose. 
Children’s stories should be dramatic ; that is, they should 
be full of vim, vigor, and sequence. The plan of a story 
should resemble that of a simple drama; you should look 
for an introduction or opening, in which the boards are 
cleared and the characters introduced; there should be a set- 
ting of time and place, with a natural progression toward a 
climax. Look over many of the accepted children’s stories 
and see whether there is any “economy of incident,” or 
whether most of them are not made up of a number of 
unrelated incidents pointing to no adequate conclusion. 
Unity, action, sequence, and climax should characterize the 
construction of a story. Imagine a house built without a 
preconceived plan ; what loss of time, what waste space and 
confusion, would result! A story without a definite method 
of procedure is even more distressing, for it leads to a lack 
of organization in the thinking of the children.
-P-A-G-E-199
  
LITERATURE 189 
Good literature organizes the imagination, and affords 
good mental training. The simplicity of children’s stories 
is no obstacle. Take the so-called constructive stories, such 
as “ The Little Red Hen,” “ The Old Woman and her Pig,” 
etc. Every incident in these stories grows out of the pre- 
ceding and necessitates the following. One cannot take 
out one step in the process without destroying the whole 
fabric of the ‘story. These constructive stories, overlooked 
by many and considered permissible nonsense by others, 
hold in their make-up the essentials of good literature. 
Why? Because there is a simple plot, a main action, a 
steady movement toward a climax, and a unity of purpose 
which never falters until the tale is told. The character is 
introduced, the setting stated, the action set going without 
quibble or delay. These stories also contain a fair meas- 
ure of suspense, a point of highest interest, an unraveling 
of thé difficulty, and a definite conclusion. Such stories 
are moral in their influence, for they lead the mind step 
by step through a series of organized incidents toward a 
legitimate conclusion. 
“Mother Goose,” which, after all, represents the childish 
heartbeats of the race, is too much neglected. The primary 
teacher who cannot see the naiveté, humor, and sugges- 
tion of “Mother Goose”; who cannot swing to its rhythm, 
or enjoy the variety of its action, should ask to be trans- 
ferred to some place in the elementary school where infor- 
mation, not humanity, rules. What does “Mother Goose” 
offer to the children? Why is it called good literature ? 
First, it has plot, the very beginning of it. A good short 
story has a simple plot, and usually magnifies one charac- 
ter or incident. Again, the people who jump through the 
pages of “ Mother Goose” have real individuality, character. 
Old Mother Hubbard, Little Tommy Grace, live in the 
 
-P-A-G-E-200
  
  190 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
mind of childhood as tenaciously as some of Shakespeare’s 
characters live in mature minds. It is only a question 
of development, analysis, complexity. The characters of 
“Mother Goose” are merely outline sketches, as incomplete 
and yet as suggestive as children’s drawings. “ Mother 
Goose” has movement, climax, and heroic justice. The 
characters in it quickly meet their natural fate, irrespec- 
tive of manners and morals. There is no false altruism 
to suspend judgment, but the lively little characters are 
born to act, and to meet the consequences of their actions, 
with a promptness and decision which leave no room for 
argument. 
“Mother Goose” is imaginative, and deals with the un- 
expected, the unusual, the grotesque, and the deliciously 
human. It offers a succession of pictures with such simple 
incident that the children can visualize them as they go. 
“Mother Goose” is full of rime, alliteration, music. The 
ear is tickled by the pronounced and constantly changing 
“rhythm. “Mother Goose” is so childlike that it awakens 
an emotional response, and an emotional response means 
personal interest. 
“Mother Goose” offers a study of motive within the 
child’s comprehension, and starts some analysis of character 
which is most suggestive. There is always a problem to be 
solved. Each sketch is a simple problem represented as 
swiftly and as clearly as a moving picture. The whole story 
is grasped by the children in its completeness, yet these 
small units contain the essentials of more complex stories. 
Good literature should bring vivid phases of life to the 
children, out of which each child may take what he needs, 
what he is ready for. Each child’s heart, by inheritance and 
experience, is attuned to certain responses; it is hospitable 
to certain suggestions and ready for certain conclusions ; it
-P-A-G-E-201
LITERATURE 191 
will eagerly grasp that for which it is prepared. Literature, 
therefore, may not be put up in handy pellets. One may 
not teach honesty on specific days with specific stories, but 
instead should tell stories just as they come from the heart 
of the race, with all their ideality and suggestion. The 
heart of the child will seize upon that which touches it. 
Literature is an art as elusive as moon shadows on a still 
night. It exists for its beauty — beauty of structure, lan- 
guage, and theme, woven together by the threads of human 
life. It must reflect life, as the clear stream carries on its 
waters the image of the overhanging tree. 
To achieve results in literature the children must have 
something more than a good story: they must have a good 
story-teller, — one with quick sympathies and an intuitive 
knowledge of her group ; one who loves the old stories, who 
feels the pulse of humanity throbbing through them all; 
whose voice is clear, flexible, interpretive ; whose language 
is simple, direct, pictorial; who enters into a dramatic situ- 
ation; who has a keen sense of humor; who is willing to 
sow the seed and let it develop in its own good time. 
A few years ago the Story-Teller’s League was organized, 
and this is doing something to bring to the children good 
stories, well told. Library training schools have also under- 
taken to train professional story-tellers. But the primary 
teacher should jealously guard and exercise her own per- 
sonal privilege to tell good stories in the familylike inti- 
macy of her schoolroom. “'The one supreme need in all 
this story and child-reading movement,” says G. Stanley 
Hall, “is to eliminate not the vile, for that is readily de- 
tected, but the second and third best from the first best. 
. . . The vital problem is to produce and identify the very 
best, and to save children from the second best, and to get 
the true and normal child point of view.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
  192 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
It would take too much space to enumerate lists of good 
stories. Excellent lists may be obtained from the Pittsburgh 
Library. It may not be out of place, however, to suggest 
certain types of stories which should guide teachers in their 
selection. Besides fairy tales, myths, and legends, the liter- 
ature period should make room for stories of primitive man 
and his industries; stories of lumbermen, fishermen, fire- 
men, sailors, and soldiers; stories of shepherd life, of chil- 
dren of many different lands, of discovery and inventions. 
Children should know how the work of the world is done, 
and be filled with admiration for the men and women who 
give their lives to its arduous tasks. Good literature should 
establish a philosophy of life, and awaken a supreme faith 
in humanity. 
It is sympathy, humanity, and an understanding of life 
that we need. Any one can accumulate facts in regard to 
life, but to know it, to love it, to live it, one must feel its 
beating pulse in literature. Every teacher of primary chil- 
dren should steep herself in the old stories which tell the 
struggle and victory of the race. Such stories as Dasent 
tells are simple, frank, earnest, and pure-hearted. They 
deal with elemental emotions, childlike conceptions, and 
will be forever young. They do not take account of the 
sophistication of, later civilization, but carry one by leaps 
and bounds through the wild country of imagination and 
heroic adventure. They are direct. In them cause and 
effect follow each other so naturally that they are within 
the grasp of the child mind. They are full of mood and 
poetry, and the children are stirred by them. These classic 
stories deal naively with the fundamental relations of man 
and woman. Do not be afraid of the fundamental relations 
of life depicted in these stories. Many an opportunity will 
arise, if one does not rob the story of its simplicity and 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  
LITERATURE 193 
spontaneity, to bring to the children the purity and signifi- 
cance of those deeper human relations of mother and child, 
man and woman, brother and sister. Why should such a 
line as the following be omitted, or subjected to censor- 
ship: “And every night the prince lay down beside her” ? 
Literature gives the opportunity to state facts and intimate 
relations in a vein of naturalness, beauty, and purity which 
open the door of life and invite the pure of heart to enter. 
The sophisticated mind must not read into simple relations 
that which does not exist in the realm of childhood, but 
allow literature to state the truths of life in all their poetry 
and romance. The serious, the humorous, the sublime, and 
the pathetic start out of literature as suddenly and as natu- 
rally as bees from the cups of flowers, for life is the sum 
of all these emotions, and literature is its image thrown 
upon the heart of the race. 
 
-P-A-G-E-204
  CHAPTER XV 
READING 
The primary teacher is not allowed to determine whether 
the six-year-old child is ready to master the technicalities 
of the printed page. She is instructed to proceed with 
the course of study without discussion of its merits, and her 
problem is solely one of method. How can she acquaint 
the child with the symbols of the printed page with the 
least unnecessary expenditure of energy? Where is the 
line of least resistance, and what instincts or capacities 
has the child which may be directed toward this end ? 
The kindergarten child enters the first grade with a 
vigorous command of language and with an unlimited ca- 
pacity for speech development. His mind is stored with 
concrete imagery, and he should have accumulated rich ex- 
periences of sight, sound, and touch. He has represented 
his experiences in the crude, bold outlines of drawing, mod- 
eling, and paper cutting. Such a background of images 
and experiences is the prerequisite for reading. He comes 
to the first grade eager to project these images, for he is still 
in the picture-making age. Picture making is his means 
of communication, and if he has no material to use, he will 
even resort to shadow pictures to express his thought. 
He is ready and eager to illustrate his own first reader, 
and should be allowed to do so. 
Little children in this initial stage of reading have no 
use for a textbook. They should read only from those of 
their own making. They should begin to connect object 
194
-P-A-G-E-205
READING 195 
and written symbol by being encouraged to tag or name 
the pictures they have drawn. Such work gives a feeling 
of possession and intimacy with words which the orthodox 
primer never can awaken. Give the children large sheets 
of manila paper and a crayon, and let them begin there and 
then to combine picture and symbol in a book of their own 
making. As capacity for remembering and representing 
symbols grows, small pictures cut from magazines may be 
used instead of the drawings, and the writing gradually 
reduced to a corresponding size. The child with a bit of 
encouragement soon passes the tagging stage, and will 
express his thought in short, simple sentences. These sen- 
tences will provide for abundant repetition of the same 
symbols without intervention of the teacher with her pre- 
scribed lists of arbitrary words. The child naturally repeats 
himself, and his interests are so uniform that a teacher 
with half an eye can see to it that the child acquires a 
definite and ample vocabulary. The results of this kind 
of composition will bear inspection in regard to the choice 
and use of words better than the stupid reiterations of the 
average primer. 
In spite of theory to the contrary, we are still putting 
the cart before the horse, as of old. We boast of new 
methods, and flatter ourselves, because we have laid aside 
the A B C’s of our forefathers, that we have arrived at 
unique and practical instruction in the art of reading. Visit 
the schools and see whether this is true. See whether the 
children are not studying tiresome lists of isolated words 
and reading the vapid, unrelated sentences which are spilled 
over a prescribed number of pages. There is no doubt 
but that the children’s minds are being stored with visual 
images of empty symbols in the hope that some time in 
the future they will tie a thought to them. 
 
-P-A-G-E-206
    196 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Children have a record-making tendency and arrive very 
early at a period when they begin to substitute signs for 
ideas. This natural desire to record facts and events may be 
used advantageously in the teaching of reading. Records 
should be made of personal experiences, of observation, dis- 
covery, and of results of constructive work. For the very 
young child these records should be purely pictorial. But 
as he enjoys a greater variety of experiences and grows in 
the power to represent them, picture and symbol should be 
combined. Finally, he will lay aside picture making and 
be ready to cope with the technicalities of the’ printed or 
written page. 
The average reader eliminates the personal element, and 
substitutes a series of sophisticated sentences which will 
" force the repetition of particular words; irrespective of the 
. child’s need of them. The compilers of these books proceed 
upon the presumption that a child must be presented with 
Bs ready-made vocabulary, so that if he should chance to 
* think for himself at some future time, he will have the means 
of expressing his thought. Vocabulary does not grow in 
this way. Words come dancing into the child’s mind fast 
enough when they are invited to clothe ideas. Necessity 
is truly the mother of invention, and children have been 
known to coin their own words to express new ideas. The 
imitative lip reading of the early grades will never make in- 
telligent readers nor build up language power. . The forced: 
and dramatic repetition of these inoffensively commonplace 
reader sentences is affectation, not interpretation. When 
feeling is genuine, the voice will make it known. Does any 
one have to force a child to exclaim over a Christmas tree 
or a kite? So-called expression in the early grades is all 
overdone. Most of the material is too stupidly common- 
place to call for oral expression at all. The whole purpose 
SG
-P-A-G-E-207
READING 197 
of reading, which should be to think by means of the 
printed symbol, is buried under the ruinous temptation of 
the schools to make precocious readers. These little super- 
ficial word-tellers tickle the false pride of parents and win 
approval from doubtful superintendents, but they lose the 
power to think, or to get thought from the printed page. 
There is entirely too much oral reading in the early 
grades. We should substitute abundant silent reading, — 
silent, earnest grappling with the printed page to get some 
needed information. (There should be discussion, question- 
ing, exchange of ideas between teacher and pupil, but a 
very limited amount of oral reading. The child, in reading 
the simple sentences which are within his capacity, has no 
occasion for oral reading. The prevailing habit of voicing 
empty phrases, and of substituting for interpretive thinking 
insistent emphasis upon tone, position, and correctness, is 
disastrous to self-culture. 
The silent reading referred to does not mean that a child 
may not vocalize what he reads. In fact, this is just what 
he should do when grappling with new material. Silent 
reading means reading to one’s self to find out something, 
in distinction from the perfunctory reading aloud to the 
teacher and the class. Such declamation is precocious, 
elocutionary, inartistic; it absolutely ‘vitiates wholesome 
expression. It is true that_the ear must_reénforce the eye 
in the early process of reading, but it is only the child 
himself who needs to hear what he reads. His vocalization 
needs to be barely audible, and should not disturb any one. 
The child has acquired his spoken language entirely through 
the ear, therefore the sound of a word calls up itg mean- 
ing far more readily than the sight of a word. This Tiecessity 
for vocalization represents a transition period, and the child 
should be permitted to vocalize as long as it is an aid to

interpretation. Children vary in this respect, and individual 
differences should be respected. In some children this con- 
nection between the nerve centers of hearing and articu- 
lation is as deep-seated as right-handedness or any other 
innate tendency. 
The symbols with which the child comes in contact 
should provide information, reénforce experience, clarify his 
thinking. Their mastery should enable him to get thought 
independently from the printed page. If such an ideal is 
borne in mind, how many tedious hours of oral reading will 
be taken out of the school. Through silent reading the chil- 
dren are: taught to seize upon the high places, to. get at the 
substance of the thing read, and to put their energy into 
thought-getting instead of into artificial delight in the sound 
       
      
   
                              of their own voices. 
The difficulties of mastering the ‘printed page are as 
great as any ever offered by the eleméntary school, and 
yet we complacently present them to the child of six, and 
are impatient of progress. The mature man or woman, to 
whom the technicalities of reading are perfectly simple, 
is allowed to fix his eyes upon his book and to read with- 
out interruption. The child, on the contrary, who does not 
know how to keep his place, whose eyes are not codrdi- 
nated for the finer movements required by reading, is made 
to look up after every line, and to give out a vapid sen- 
tence, such as “ Willie has a hat,” with the inflection and 
satisfaction of a scientific discovery. A small boy whose 
initiation into reading had been unaccountably difficult 
came home one day radiant with delight. He had been 
finally allowed to go into the second grade on trial. He 
said: “O mother, now I can read all right. My teachey 
lets me read just the way papa does, and does not mak 
me lift my eyes up and smile after every story.” Suc

interrupted, piecemeal reading is a destroyer of thought, 
and focuses the mind absolutely upon the mechanics of 
the printed page. 
It is only fair that the reading of the primary school 
should be subjected to inspection and realize some literary 
standard. J igobibiedavela read for two reasons: to add to 
the sum of his knowledge, and for pure-delight ; that is, 
for the dramatic or humorous or storylike quality of what he 
reads. Submit the reading lessons of the primary school 
to such a test, and how many of them belong in the waste- 
basket ? Reading should not be an end in itself, nor should 
it be accidental, but it should be an illuminating accom- 
paniment to the literature, handwork, history, and geog- 
raphy of the grade. With younger children this ideal can 
only be upheld by making free use of the blackboard. 
The children should make their own reading lessons, with 
  the teacher. These lessons should be written in large, bold 
script'on the blackboard, so that they may be summaries 
of the day’s work, put together, changed, or erased, as the 
needs of the children demand. Only when the early work 
is made up of sentences taken from the personal daily 
interests of the children will it be vital. Only the events 
and facts in which they have taken part are worth record- 
ing if the children are to be required to read the records. 
Reading lessons which are made with the class are con- 
structive in character; they take on the quality of the 
handwork which so fascinates and educates. What the 
reading lessons need is a feeling of creativity on the part 
of the child. This is accomplished when a child is encour- 
aged to picture his own experiences in simple sentences, and 
to become a factor in the construction of the story which 
he is to read. Is there in the average reading lesson any- 
thing like the sensation which the child gets in handwork

when he makes a wagon, and then pulls it along the floor ?

power, and a desire for more work of a similar character

continue to be the case until the teacher lays aside long 
lists of words to be memorized, and seizes upon lists of 
kindred topics out of which a childlike vocabulary will

mand the instruments. } 
A word properly présented to a child is a picture. He 
adds it to his thought-stuff as he puts a dress on his doll 
or a spoon in his cup. Visit an art gallery. Which pic- 
tures will you remember after a few days? Only those 
which have brought to your mind some personal experience, 
which reflected your own emotional life, which you under- 
stood because of some vital association. Words should be 
presented as pictures of thought which have a personal 
meaning, and not as elements or combinations of sounds. 
Let the reading lessons of the primary grade take on a 
story quality, that they may profit from the energizing effect 
of interest and enthusiasm. Repetition is necessary to en- 
force a needed bit of information, but repetition with variety 
may be had if true literature is studied, and the qualities 
which have made it the mouthpiece of the race‘are inserted 
into the reading lesson. Compare the language of “ Mother 
Goose” with that of the average primer. Study the kind 
~ of repetition which “Mother Goose” contains. It grows out 
of and is a part of the story, while in the primer repeti- 
tion is an arbitrary thing, set in for the obtrusive purpose 
of enforcing some word. Let the qualities which enter into 
game. life — expectancy, repetition, imitation, action, and 
joy —find their place in the reading lesson of the primary

school. These human, efflorescent, dramatic qualities char- 
acteristic of child life may be crystallized into reading 
material by a quick, effective use of the blackboard, and 
in the reading books of the child’s own making. 
There is not enough reading to children in the primary 
years. <A child should be read to every day without being 
expected to make any return. Spoken language is acquired 
by such means. One is willing to talk and talk to a child, 
long before he is able to answer with a spoken word; the 
child understands, although he says nothing himself; he 
is collecting the material of speech, storing it somewhere, 
and sometime he will suddenly surprise you with his accu- 
mulated possessions. Reading has this nascent period too, 
and a child should have the opportunity to follow with his 
own. book in hand a good reading of familiar stories again 
and again, that the printed symbol, and its oral expression, 
may be unconsciously identified. By such a method a child 
gets technique, and the thought expressed by it, without 
too much conscious focusing upon the technique itself. He 
will become accustomed to read as rhythmically as he talks, 
without stilted and forced inflection. Six or eight minutes 
given to this practice each day will increase the desire to 
read, give conscious models for imitation, and train the 
class in attention. 
Reading should lead to imagery, association, feeling, 
and motor response. Does the average reading book excite 
such responses, or does it deal with commonplaces which 
are merely rolled about on the tongue ? ‘ 
The reading lessons are apt to go ahead of the child’s 
power, —we are so impatient of progress, so jealous of 
time. We lay too much stress upon the number of pages 
covered, too little upon the desire awakened and the taste 
acquired.   
 
-P-A-G-E-212
    202 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Children should be allowed time at least once a week 
for undirected reading, —save as to a suggestion of what 
to read, —time to read with no thought of reproduction 
other than a voluntary one; they should have time to read 
for mere delight, to form a reading habit, and to establish 
reading tastes. 
\ Reading is thinking by means of the printed page, not 
the technical mastery of words. ) Little children are in the 
language-building period, and if the proper transition is 
made, will quickly learn the language of the printed page 
as well as of the spoken word. Their interests are so varied 
and their curiosity so keen that one cannot set the limits 
to what they may acquire. \The secret of success is to 
keep the work childlike, full of action, and vitally related 
to the daily interests and habits. Children are accumula- 
ting, putting together, labeling, classifying, and selecting 
in a wholesale sort of way. They are open to suggestion 
along a thousand different lines, but ready for prescription 
in none.

CHAPTER XVI 
HANDWRITING 
I. Writing in the race. Handwriting is one of the latest 
and highest achievements of man. Geiger calls it “the 
most marvelous art which it was at all possible for man 
to create.” Like all great things, it is the result of a long, 
gradual development. 
The beginnings of the art were rude and desultory scrawls 
such as even eolithic man must have produced in his idle 
moments, prompted by the old instinct of workmanship. 
The rudiments of handwriting in the child are found in 
playful scribbling similar in origin and character. ‘The hand 
is a most natural means of) expression as well as of con- 
struction. \ The facial and laryngeal muscles scarcely exceed 
it in mobility and sensitiveness to mental states. Just as 
the dog’s tail, not being burdened with the task of locomo- 
tion, became an animated semaphore, with a considerable 
code of language wags, so the hand of primitive man be- 
came the vehicle of communication. The hand is anatomi- 
cally so superior to the canine tail that it lends itself to 
a high development of sign language. The gestures of prim- 
itive man at first surpassed speech in efficiency. Living ” 
primitive people show marvelous power in hand talk. \To 
this)day the Indians of the Mississippi Valley, with their 
scores of dialects, cannot ‘understand each other by word 
of mouth, but they meet on the ground of a universal ges- 
ture language. By this Esperanto of the hand they can 
trade, negotiate, and even tell each other love stories. 
203
-P-A-G-E-214
  
204 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
There are innumerable nerve filaments which bind the 
fingers to the brain cortex. With the development of mental 
imagery and mental codrdination, pictures emerge out of 
the rude, aimless scrawls, somewhat as articulate speech 
arises out of babbling and cooing. Picture writing is really 
a form of gesture, — graphic pantomime. ‘On bark and 
wood and stone, on skulls and skins and bones and teeth, on 
surfaces formed of various fibers, and with some tribes on the 
_human body in tattooing, the pictures were made according 
to the exigency of the case or the whim of the artist.” 
The pictographs were, of course, very rude, concrete, 
and unconventional. It took hours to tell a simple story 
which we now could write out in as many minutes, but in 
these same rude pictographs, as Huey says, “ lay the germs 
  of the alphabets which made civilization possible.” In some 
cases the historian has actually traced out the pedigree. 
Our letter M, for example, passed through seven distin- 
guishable metamorphoses, starting with an Egyptian hiero- 
glyphic owl. It surely is interesting to reflect upon the 
immense gap between the laborious, slow-witted etchings 
of the cave man and the modern lightning stenographs 
which are dashed off at the rate of two hundred words per 
minute; but it would be wrong to think that there is no 
genetic relationship between pictography and penmanship. 
Il. Motion-picture writing. The pedagogy of penmanship 
must recognize the genetic background of handwriting. 
Primitive man wrote pictorially before he wrote alphabet- 
ically, and so should the child. Even Pestalozzi appreciated 
that there is some pedagogical connection between elemen- 
tary drawing and writing. To thé primary-school child hand- 
writing is about as foreign and impossible as it is to a patient 
suffering from the brain troubles known as agraphia and 
alexia. The highly complex and conventional symbols of

the copy book are as foreign to his experience as Sanskrit 
is to most of us. If we want to draw out his powers of 
hand-expression, we must make connection with his own 
stock of concrete, mental images. 
And the beauty of it is he has just those visual-motor 
images of motion which are pictorial in import but contain 
the basal elements of handwriting. These mental motion 
pictures which he so easily.and joyfully transfers to the 
blackboard make a splendid transition from drawing to pen- 
manship. The crude sketches of men, animals, houses, ete. of 
course come first of all. Through these drawings the child 
develops his powers of coérdination and perception, but he 
will represent moving: things as naturally as stable ones, 
just as primitive man in pantomime, dance, and pictograph 
represented the rocking of the waves, the heaving of nets, or 
the flight of birds. Such dynamic, pictorial representations 
will resemble writing as much as drawing, because they will 
have the progression and continuity of fluent script. 
If children are too suddenly and arbitrarily introduced 
to letter forms, expression is stilted and crippled. (If we 
start with the copy book, the child has neither motor images 
that command nor codrdinated muscles which execute. 
The use of pictorial or representative writing in the early 
stages is effective because its starting point is familiar 
motor images related in the child’s mind to pleasant reac- 
tions./ In language making the child imitates tone, inflec- 
tion, and rhythm of speech before he masters words; so in 
writing there is a play period working toward muscular 
control which expresses itself in bold, flowing, pictorial 
representation of rhythmical sound and movement. Chil- 
dren will only write easily when the mind is filled with 
easy, continuous motor images which are so compelling 
that they coax the muscles into involuntary play.

7 Their first writing should represent ideas, just as the 
primitive pictographs did. Children are, like primitive man, 
in a naive, creative, responsive, artistic, representative mood, 
and if encouraged will represent motion in lively, flowing 
lines upon the blackboard, Aheir minds are full of innumer- 
able motor images which they have met with peculiar delight 
in their kinship with nature. They love to watch the trees 
bend in the wind, for the delight in the regular recurrence of 
ggpton and sound is instinctive. They feel the poetry of mo- 
tion, and easily and spontaneously portray it; for instance, 
in such an exercise as the following: 
How do you like to go up in a swing, 
Up in the air so blue? 
Oh, I do think it the pleasantest thing 
Ever a child can do! 
Up in the air and over the wall, 
Till I can see so wide,

may even say, as one little fellow did, “I touched the top 
of the branch with my toe!”

be used for this pictorial work. Children do not care to

upon the chalk, the hoop will upset; if the motion is 
not continuous, flowing, even, the hoop will cease to roll. 
The same exercise, or the reverse, may represent jumpygg 
rope, and the accent or rhythm may be , 
made to fall upon the lower line, as if the 
rope quickly struck the ground in succes- 
sive swoops. 
Among many other rhythms and mo- 
tions which may be pictorially represented 
are the swinging of the pendulum, the 
beating of the drum, and the marching 
of soldiers down the street. The sky- 
rocket may be represented with a vigor- 
ous oblique stroke made to the sound of 
sh-sh-sh! The cadenced humming of bees 
is naturally represented by rhythmic con- 
tinuous lines. ;

ommended is not to be confused with the construction 
of spectacles, vases, ete. out of combinations of ovals and .

conscious selection of the hand movement. 
Various factors are gradually added to 
each other by a process of organic fusion.”

ou a whole year, the child should be kept at 
this bold, motion-picture writing, the im-

notwithstanding. This dynamic drawing 
can be filled with much joy, even beauty, and we may 
be sure that in its performance the child is laying the 
foundation of the pyramid of habits called handwriting.

Ill. The rhythmic writing mood. In Volume II, the fif- 
teenth lecture of his work on “ Experimental Pedagogy,” Dr. 
Ernst Meumann makes an interesting analysis of the writ- 
ing process. By means of a delicate pneumatic apparatus 
and a revolving smoked drum, he secured records of the

variation in rapidity and pressure of the handwriting of 
children and adults. He found that six- and seven-year-old 
children never exert a rhythmical pressure within a word ; 
that is, a maximum showing itself in a wave crest at the 
beginning, middle, or e 
end of “the pressure / 
curve,” as indicated in oe 
the accompanying dia- 
grams. The beginner

  uniform pressure for 
every letter, or at first for every stroke. Meumann found 
that adults likewise show a temporal rhythm, — that is, 
rhythmic slowing and acceleration, — while children tend 
to write their words with uniform speed. Children also 
exert a greater absolute pressure. Figs. 44 and 45 are 
the pressure and speed curves of an adult and a child 
writing the letter 7% The lower lines in each figure are 
the time record, the notches in that of Fig. 44 being the 
marks of a metronome beating sixty times per second.

sure, and the three separate impulses, one for each stroke.

On these data Meumann concludes that the development 
of handwriting in children consists chiefly in that, first, it 
becomes more rapid; second, that the separate impulses 
fuse into one total impulse with a rhythmical subordination 
of individual pressures to one chief pressure, till the inner- 
vations of a word result in a unitary act in which the whole
-P-A-G-E-220
  210 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
word is executed with one stroke of the will. He also thinks 
that the individual letters should be mastered thoroughly 
before proceeding to the writing of words. 
This analysis, instructive as it is, betrays one of the chief 
limitations of experimental pedagogy. The technical meth- 
ods of laboratory analysis must often fail in evaluating 
the factor of mood and attitude in the learning activity of 
children. (Our experience in the classroom has proved, first, 
that the six- or seven-year-old child does not need to exert 
undue pressure in his writing; second, that he need not write 
unrhythmically either in pressure or time; third, that he 
does not have to write in a piecemeal manner with numer- 
ous separate impulses; fourth, that words should not wait 
for the mastery of individual letters. From the very start 
the beginner’s penmanship may possess the adult qualities 
of fluency, accent, and individuality, if it will only spring 
from familar imagery and the rhythmic mood. Meumann’s 
analysis indicates not so much the natural and necessary 
development of children’s writing as the baneful results of 
poor methods of teaching. 
Surely it is not natural for a child to draw in a patchy, 
piecemeal fashion. AVatch him at his drawing and see with 
what fine daring and abandon he makes his lines. Put a 
pencil in his hands and ask him to write, and he glides it 
across the paper with a continuous and often graceful mo- 
tion. /A circle of kindergarten children were asked to write 
a letter, and only two of them made circumscribed scrawls ; 
the remaining eleven went bravely and flowingly across the 
page after the manner of the accompanying cut (Fig. 46). 
This natural, continuous movement should be culti- 
vated, not combated. The very purity of motion which 
is the ultimate end of writing, and which the child brings 
to school, is broken up by jerky, painful movements in

premature striving at technical control. This results in the 
absurd draftsmanship in which even such a decided unit 
as 0 is built up by installments. An examination of the 
pe

  specimen in Fig. 47 will show how almost every letter is 
the result of two or more independent strokes. (Writing is 
motion directed by thought, and should be a fluid accom- 
paniment of thought. )The specimen in Fig. 48, taken from

Meumann has said: “ While the adult writes the whole 
word with one will impulse, the child has to make a num- 
ber of separate efforts, —as many as there are letters or 
separate strokes. ‘The child writes with individual im- 
pulses, the adult with merged impulses ( G'esamtimpulsen).” 
May this not be due to the fact that the early writing of 
children is usually a dull, tiresome, commonplace effort to 
reproduce arbitrary forms? Monotony will destroy the clev- 
erest bit of oral language, and so it will inhibit writing; 
for writing is the transmission of thought, and must take 
on its rhythm. Separate, unrelated words awaken no im- 
pulses which call for unitary motion or decisive strokes.

Fie. 48. ILLeGisie sur Fruenr Writinc 
  The adult writing movements follow thoughts and ideas, 
and naturally express accent and rhythm. Emotion pro- 
duces a corresponding movement, and the fault in the 
writing of little children is that all emotion is lacking. The 
writing is simply muscular gymnastics, without impelling 
mood or idea to give it fluidity or grace.) Motion-picture 
writing, enlivened with rime or song, supplies the defi- 
ciency, and trains the muscles to execute the needed form 
of writing in company with feeling, the rhythmic mood. 
This attitude of rhythm is so invaluable in writing that it 
is worth special cultivation. The rimes of ‘ Mother Goose,” 
from the trotting movement of “Hey diddle diddle” to 
the slow measure of “Fe, fi, fo, fum,” furnish excellen 
material for concerted rhythmical expression at the black 
board. These rimes represent a variety of recurring ac 
cents which bring into play a corresponding variety o
-P-A-G-E-223
HANDWRITING 213 
muscular contractions in a natural, controlled way, — ‘‘ Hey 
diddle” expressed by short staccato strokes like 7, 77 777; 
“Fe, fi, fo, fum,” by longer strokes like — — — —. A 
combination of these strokes may be used in “Three Blind 
Z 7 Z 
Mice”; as, Three blind mice, They all ran after the farmer’s 
   
             
   
          
   
             
   wife, Who ent off their tails with a carving knife. Three 
blind mice. The long strokes may also be made vertically, 
and the short horizontally, and there are endless other 
variations. Unaccompanied by mood and motive, these fun- 
damental strokes, which are at the basis of writing skill, 
are impossible in children. On perfunctory prescription 
the simplest lines will be hesitant and tremulous. 
In presenting these exercises the teacher should merely 
establish the desired rhythm, set it going, and then, lower- 
ing her voice, gradually withdraw her guidance altogether. 
The pulse or rhythmical measure started seems to incor- 
porate itself into the sensitive neuromuscular make-up of 
the little children, and they continue to hum or sing softly, 
and write in flowing, cadenced lines until a new measure 
is suggested. 
Rhythm is the best friend of motor activity. It lightens 
all labor, makes for pleasure, grace, and poise of movement, 
and postpones fatigue. The workingmen of to-day, like 
their primitive ancestors, make rhythm an ally in physical 
toil. Melodic intervals possess in a high degree the power 
to stimulate energy. Experiments in the laboratory have 
shown this to be true in the case of the ergograph. This is 
an instrument in which the subject successively depresses 
la weight with one of his fingers to test his physical en- 
urance. Rhythmical grouping of the finger movements 
improves the record. Meumann found in his own tests

metronome the handwriting of children, though it may 
suffer somewhat in accuracy, becomes faster, more facile 
and fluent. The Romance peoples — Latins, Spaniards, 
Mexicans, and Italians — are proverbially good writers. 
May this not be that, because of racial temperament, they 
fall more easily into the rhythmical mood which gives 
beauty and grace to all movement ? 
Dr. E. W. Scripture, who has made a scientific study 
of speech defects, finds that the laryngeal cramp may be 
broken up by the melody cure. In his speech clinic, where 
only a few minutes can be given to each stutterer, he 
relies chiefly on this melody cure. The element of rhythm 
       
                           
   
     
    in this cure undoubtedly has something to do with break- 
ing the cramped stiffness and restoring flexibility. Dr. 
Scripture reports an instructive case of stuttering in pen- 
manship: “A Mr. H. has taken courses in writing, but 
had suffered so much on account of his penmanship that 
a nervous fear seized him the moment he took up a pen. 
Before beginning to write he would make a number of 
nervous strokes with the pen without touching the paper. 
His writing grows steadily more cramped and tremulous 
as he approaches the end of a word” (see Fig. 49). Though 
this is an extreme and rare case, milder degrees of this 
embarrassed penmanship are plentifully produced by those 
methods of teaching which are stilted and atactic in their 
very spirit, instead of partaking of the child’s joyous love 
of motion. 
While the children are at the blackboard enjoying their 
rhythmic motion pictures they are standing erect, with the 
chest up and their lungs full of air; the circulation is un: 
impeded; muscular control and a harmonious use of th 
whole body follow of themselves. ‘The symmetrical postur

the left hand as well as of the right. In the midst of the 
exercises the children can be made to exchange their chalk 
from one hand to the other for a moment or two, not with 
a view of cultivating ambidexterity, but to get the ad- 
vantages of cross-education and to increase the rhythmical

Such free blackboard exercises, because they are fluid,

For children work by mood, and this principle is the 
success of all teaching, especially of the teaching of pri- 
mary-school writing. Emotions tend to produce movement ; 
conversely, if handwriting lacks emotion, movement will 
become cramped, perfunctory, and lifeless. The rhythmic 
mood is the very joy of motion, and holds all the cardinal 
traits of handwriting, — facility, fluency, grace, and speed.

     much dramatic play-joy for children, and so much true 
gymnastic value in developing posture and body control, 
that it might well be used for its intrinsic educational and 
recreational worth. We are, however, recommending it as 
a preparation to the acquisition of handwriting, and an 
accompaniment of it. But how, it will be asked, if children 
are to be kept so long at this flowing blackboard work, will 
they ever learn to write letters and words? The transition 
is made very easily, almost unconsciously. To begin with, 
the motion-pictures themselves contain the fundamental 
strokes of handwriting, and their systematic, lively repeti- 
tion will so automatize these strokes that the technicalities 
of the alphabet will be much reduced in difficulty. More- 
over, the making of lines and curves to the saying and 
singing of “ Mother Goose” is, after all, a very real kind of 
writing. The essential thing in the rimes is their rhythm, 
and this the child really expresses in his broadly symbolic 
lines. Besides, the child does it all in a spirit of playful] 
self-illusion, and thinks that he actually is writing th 
rime; and after he writes it he reads it back to himself. 
Early picture writing represented ideas in a few bol 
strokes, and so does this disingenuous rime-and-motion.

humming of the bees incorporates ». In time the exercises 
can be varied to incorporate other letters, or even combina- 
tions of them; but these letters are always to be made in 
a flowing, easy fashion, in the natural relation of forward, 
fluent movement, unhampered by the crippling conscious- 
ness of form. The painstaking, arbitrary drawing of a, 6, ¢, d 
is unchildlike, self-conscious, and irksome,— defeating its 
own purpose by creating a distaste for writing, setting a 
habit of slow, characterless script, and dissociating writing 
from all ideas.( Writing in the minds of most children is 
an unwelcome task, and has no relation to record making 
and communication, which is its excuse for being. 
It is no longer considered pedagogical to dissociate pri- 
mary reading from feeling and a desire to communicate and 
understand. We wish to call attention to the identity of 
principles underlying the acquisition of reading and writing. 
Both functions may be lifeless, stilted, and monotonous, or 
may be the opposite. Both may be ‘painfully self-conscious, 
discrete, analytic, and hypertechnical, and both benefit by the 
whole method as opposed to the part method of teaching. 
It has been proved experimentally that children can per- 
ceive — that is, recognize and name — words about as read- 
‘ ily as single letters, and the same is true in a measure of 
sentences. The word is a natural, vital unit. Its visual ap- 
pearance, indeed, is not a sum of letter appearances, but 
has a character of its own. Children are very susceptible 
to the individuality of words, and though it may be logi- 
cal to split the word into its alphabetical elements, it is 
not psychological. (The old writing masters used to begin 
their writing lessons with monotonous drill on artificial 
units like hooks and loops, thinking that the logical pro- 
cedure in penmanship. This method is really as absurdly 
unpedagogical as the A-B-C' method of teaching ae

  218 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
( Prolonged practice on isolated a, 6, ¢, d, before attacking 
words, has no more place in writing than in reading. Chil- 
dren should be encouraged to do what is so natural and 
possible for them, — namely, to take in the whole word, and 
to write the whole word, as they draw a whole picture. They 
will grow tremendously in this power to picture whole 
words, — which, by the way, will greatly improve their spell- 
ing, for spelling is nothing more nor less than the ability to 
write correctly. db 
Orthography means literally “straight writing.” This 
correct writing of words should be natural, and should be 
brought about by positive, not negative, impressions. There 
is no place in the early school work for arbitrary lists of 
isolated words to be spelled. A definite content or sentence 
relationship should be assoc siated with the visual image 
of every word studied. (Children should be encouraged to 
look again and again at the correctly written word, until 
the image of it becomes indelibly fixed. The trial-and-error 
method frequently resorted to brings about inhibition and 
mistaken images, which often persist for a lifetime. Do not 
allow a child to write a word incorrectly, for the corrected 
papers which are returned to him only fill his mind with 
distorted images and false impressions. ) 
‘Have. the children look attentively as the word is written 
on the board, perhaps erased two or three times. Then let 
the class write the word quickly and with decision. Such 
exercises will reduce the number of individual impulses, 
and make unnecessary the mastery of separate letters before 
proceeding to words. After a while the children will not only 
picture words but also sentences, and write the sentences 
as easily as the word. 
We have eliminated the letter consciousness in reading, 
and should apply a like pedagogy to writing. Writing is

picture making, and the letters of a word maintain a definite 
relation one to another, just as the lines of a drawing. It is 
the relations, combinations, and fusing of the letters which 
give individuality to words. It is not the letter conscious- 
ness, but the word consciousness, that should be aimed at.

A perfect: word picture, it must be admitted, does not 
always secure corresponding results in writing. The model 
and the visual image must be properly associated with 
motor impulses before the copy will be accurate. A group 
of kindergarten children were asked to copy a large 6 
and 7 displayed before them. The figure above shows some 
of the more interesting errors resulting from the test. These

errors are due not to perception, nor to a lack of muscular 
ability, but to an absence of codrdination, point for point, 
between the visual and motor factors. / This lack of visual- 
motor codrdination accounts for the strange inversions 
which so often appear in the writing of primary-school 
children, such as are shown in the writing in Fig. 51. The 
piecemeal analysis of words and letters may also contribute 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  220 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
to the dislocation of parts. In one primary-school room 
which was visited it seemed that the majority of the children 
lapsed into writing inversion. 
How may these inversions be avoided ? By making the 
whole word a motion picture. Let the children see not 
only the static, dead model but the dynamic unfoldment 
of the model, —the word. Let them see and imitate the 
movement as well as the result of the movement. In brief, 
let them see the teacher writing the word, so that they will 
haye a word-motion-picture.) 
/There is another feature of good writing, which depends 
upon proper imagery rather than upon prescription and. 
scolding ; that is, writing in a straight line. Even beginners 
do not need lines for their guidance. Show them how to 
place a dot where they begin to write, another where they 
should end the sentence, another in the middle for those 
who are most inclined to write uphill. The children will 
then soon begin to think straight lines and have mental line 
pictures, and will correct their own mistakes. Go about 
with a ruler occasionally and place it under the sentences 
written, so that the child may see his error. Lay the ruler 
also on the top where the tall letters should reach, and so 
awaken a healthy self-criticism.) 
Another minor problem is the transition from blackboard 
to paper. When the time comes to make use of the pen- 
cil, the children should be given large sheets of wrap- 
ping paper and be encouraged to use the same large, 
flowing script. It has been found practicable to have the 
children fold the paper, gradually making it smaller and 
smaller, until the script is reduced to a comfortable, 
normal size. 
/Speed and accuracy are painfully difficult problems if 
writing is acquired after a logical, alphabetical, calligraphic

manner, but not if a premium is always put upon spirit 
and rhythm, and words are written as fluent wholes. Free 
activity, rhythm, and emotion, rather than analysis, char- 
acterize childhood.) Oral language, the inspiration of written. 
language, is acquired, not by intellectual analysis, but by 
imitation, suggestion, and play. A method realizing these 
ideals should extend to written language. If the spoken 
language and oral reading of children are made self-conscious 
by phonetic analysis of words, evil consequences will fol- 
low. Misguided phonetic drill has been called the breeding 
ground of the stuttering habit in our elementary schools. 
If this is true of the speech habit, why should it not hold 
true of the writing habit ? There is, indeed, a vast amount 
of awkward, hesitant, more or less atactic writing in our 
schools, for which the hyperlogical, alphabetic method of 
instruction must be held responsible. 
A recent system of writing, for example, recommends in 
its teacher’s manual the analytic presentation of words, and 
even of letters, as follows: “@ow. Begin the word ‘cow’ 
with a dot, come down, turn, go up, come back, turn, go 
up, close the 0, or-oval, go over, make a point, come down, 
make turn, go up, make angle, come down, turn, go up, 
make a little loop or dot, and finish toward the dot.” “ee. 
What letter is it in the middle of the word ‘ice’? It is 
the letter c. What does it look like’? It looks something 
like an ice hook, and the e looks as though it were a rope 
tied to the hook. Do you think you could tie the three 
letters together with a pencil on paper?” “Jay. Lead the 
pupil to observe that the y contains a 7, two more strokes 
and turns in the beginning. Be sure that y has two more 
” turns, one angle and one loop.” The downstroke of r is 
called “the bend of a boy’s knee,” and the o’s are “plump 
and rosy-cheeked!” If the word-picture idea set forth
-P-A-G-E-232
  
  222 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
above means anything, all such analysis, with its arrant, 
befuddling association, must be considered the worst enemy 
of fluent script. 
(There is no subject in the elementary grades which, in 
its early stages at least, is so unscientifically taught as is 
writing. The children are at once set to the task of execut- 
ing the twenty-six letters of the alphabet, —a task which 
the race mastered only yesterday. That the amateur is not 
ready for this undertaking is put beyond dispute by the con- 
tortions of his little muscular system, — contortions which   
extend from the twisting tongue to the very toes. Could 
any picture be much more unchildlike ? )Compare the smil- 
ing faces and poised bodies of a group of the same amateurs 
harmoniously indulging their fundamental muscles in free- 
flowing motion-pictures, expressing familiar images, feeling 
the pulse and joy of rhythmic movement. Such writing, 
however simple, is expressive and educative in the deepest 
sense, because it conforms to the child’s capacity, to his 
interest, and to the experience of his racial ancestors. It 
glows with truly childlike creativeness. The fluidity and 
living qualities which motion-picture writing possesses, and 
of which all writing ought to partake, elude description. 
In fact, the suggestions, which we have found rather diffi- 
cult to put into words, should not be taken seriously by 
any one who does not believe in the principle that nature 
desires children always to work by mood and motive. The _ 
teacher’s personality and her own joy of rhythm and easy, 
expressive motion must be depended upon to give the 
suggestions their true spirit and full intent.)

CHAPTER XVII 
NATURE STUDY 
“Pupils study nature in the schools, and when they get 
out they cannot find her.” Such an accusation would be un- 
deserved if nature study began in the primary-school period 
in first-hand, rapturous contact with living, growing things. 
There is nothing new under the sun, but to childhood all 
is novelty. The most commonplace things teem with noy- 
elty. Childhood endows all nature, both animate and inan- 
imate, with motive and character; with fantastic self-illusion 
even sticks and stones are made to symbolize thought and 
feeling. Nature becomes the playground of the imagination, 
and out of this joyous, naive contact with life spring the 
deeper sentiments of reverence and faith. Children are in 
astage of sense experience when this warm glow of contact 
through eye and ear and touch may be transmuted into the 
life of spirit; when light, shadow, sound, motion, and touch 
weave a tangle of lovely associations around commonplace 
experiences and build up a deep appreciation of life and 
things. Thus the truths of nature become unconsciously 
associated with emotional response, which deepens and 
safeguards them. 
The child learns more through unconscious absorption 
than through didactic prescription, and in nature study daily 
contact with the beauty, motive, and unceasing effort every- 
where shown by plant and animal gives an impulse to in- 
dividual character and sets standards of behavior. In nature, 
science and beauty walk hand in hand. They have not been 
223

  224 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
divorced by the pedagogue, to follow separate paths, and 
facts retain their romantic setting. It is not knowledge 
alone which counts in life, but knowledge plus feeling. 
Primitive man was forced into rich contact with nature, 
for his daily needs depended upon his knowledge of her 
moods and products; but the modern child, primitive in all 
eerie ee een ae 
  Fic. 52, WoLKENSCHIFFE 
(From ‘‘ Die Woche fiir die deutsche Jugend ’’) 
other respects, is withdrawn from such communion, and he 
misses both the stimulus and the inspiration when his 
nature study is made stilted and intellectual. 
The child naturally has an animistic feeling for facts. 
The wind and the rain become the friends of childhood. 
The raindrops dance like brownies as they patter on the 
stones outside, or softly fall to give the thirsty flowers 
drink. The wind howls and sings and whistles, or chases
-P-A-G-E-235
     NATURE STUDY 225 
the grasses over the meadow. It is well for the elements 
to play a part in the life of childhood in lighter moods be- 
fore they are studied as the pregnant forces which mold and 
transfigure the face of the earth. The child who has felt 
the wind blowing in his hair, who has watched to see whence 
it came when it stole his cap away, who has run with it to 
fly his kite and listened to its rustle among the trees, is 
better ready to study it in its sterner moods when he meets 
it as a great factor in erosion or as a motive power in the 
industrial world. 
We miss our opportunities. We give perfunctory in- 
struction indoors when nature is teaching the same lesson 
far better out of doors; in art, the children struggle with 
perspective before we have allowed them to feast their eyes 
upon the lights and shadows under the trees or to watch 
the colors shimmer and fade in the rainbow, while outdoors 
lines are falling into exquisite composition through vistas of 
trees and rounded hills, in the curves of the petals of every 
flower, and in the strength and bigness of. the cliffs. 
Similarly, the number sense is stifled by notation on the 
blackboard and not developed by the fundamental concep- 
tions of size, distance, and form in every open field. Num- 
ber conceptions are born in nature, not in arithmetics. Out 
of doors the child’s sense of direction may be easily trained 
to a feeling for north, south, east, west. There the relative 
height of trees, shrubs, and plants, the length of his garden 
plot, the space between rows of vegetables, establish stand- 
ards of measure and proportion. The child cannot deal with 
these concrete expressions of life and motion without con- 
stantly making comparisons, training judgment, stating 
and verifying conclusions; these experiences are the basis 
of number concepts. The child needs intimate experiences 
with long, short, round, square, acute, obtuse, big and little,
-P-A-G-E-236
  226 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
not the obtrusive insertion in arithmetics of so-called con- 
crete problems, as, “If I have four apples, and I give two 
to John, how many have I left?” when the child who works 
the problem has not had one apple, much less four. 
Children are hungry for facts, and no fairy tale can hold 
a deeper interest for them than the truths of life itself. Na- 
ture is at work everywhere, tearing down and building up, 
and the children may watch her in her workshop. Little 
children may not understand the term “erosion,” but they 
will listen with rapt attention to the story of how the sand 
was made, and come to a new consciousness in regard 
to water, wind, and weather. Animal life, from the tiny 
earthworm to the bulky elephant, from the grasshopper to 
the wonder animals of the sea, seems to weave a spell of 
enchantment for children, and to surpass the cleverest 
bits of fiction in interest. 
They are ready likewise to hear the marvelous truths 
about the sun, to indulge their imagination in the immensity 
of its great distance from the earth and yet to know that 
the sun touches their lives at every point. A study of the 
sun opens up hours of fascinating thought about light and 
darkness, day and night, month and year, sunset and sun- 
rise, sundial and shadow; about the effect of the sun upon 
plant and animal, upon food, shelter, clothing; about its 
relationship to health and even happiness, and to all the in- 
- teresting facts of temperature, steam, fuel, evaporation, ete. 
Besides these truths, for which primary-school children are 
ready, there is a wealth of material in myth, poem, and folk- 
lore which will stir the imagination and charm the listener. 
Children feel the wonder and beauty of life; they are in 
love with it and hold intimate communion with its humblest 
expression. Nature is reluctant to give them up, and still 
holds them by the hand to let them share her secrets with
-P-A-G-E-237
NATURE STUDY 227 
the birds and flowers. Self-consciousness has not yet broken 
the spell, and a child feels himself a part of one great, 
triumphant burst of life. All the world’s akin. The wind 
talks to him, the flowers bloom and hide for him, the sun 
sends a shadow playmate to him, and he does not question 
why. His quick imagination interprets the messages of 
sight, sound, and touch which greet him everywhere, and 
the purity of his contact with life fortifies his faith in it. 
The child who stands on tiptoe to peep cautiously into 
the new-found bird’s nest, who feels the velvety softness of 
growing things beneath his feet as he hunts out the tiny 
wild flowers in the spring, who sows his own garden seed 
and waits to see the first young green push its way through 
the dark, moist soil, is building up a reverence for life, 
a sense of kinship with it, which will uphold him in his 
later and deeper understanding of its meaning. 
Why is it that the little child who bends in hushed ten- 
derness over the new baby’s crib, who instinctively strokes 
the baby cheek as gently as if it were the frail petal of a 
rose, who assumes at once the attitude of defense and paren- 
tal protection toward it, often becomes the guilty, inquis- 
itive, unclean boy or girl? Why do children run to meet 
life with eager purity and go away soiled by the contact ? 
Is it not because we are all afraid of truth; because we 
give them feeble, foolish makeshifts about life instead of 
its wonderful facts? We begin, with the perverted inter- 
pretations and sentimentality of the so-called nature study 
in the primary grades, to offer unscientific and inane fairy 
tales about nature, which degrade the imagination but do 
not deceive the understanding. Children are poetic, sen- 
sitive, and pure-hearted. They are never startled by the 
truth, but are more logical than we concede, and silently 
reject what their reason tells them is untrue. The little boy 
 
-P-A-G-E-238
ee ee 
228 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
of five who said, “I always knew the stork never brought 
me, for I have n’t a peck in my side, have I?” had become 
a common-sense skeptic. A failure to give him then and 
there as much of the truth as he was ready for and the 
consciousness that he could always find an answer to his 
questions would have started him upon the unclean path. 
Nature is frank; she presents a beautiful panorama of life, 
death, reproduction, mating, and parenthood, and calls the 
growing child to come and look upon it; the child is ready 
to take it in with pure eyes, to catch the wonder, beauty, 
and responsibility of it all, to become the champion of its 
cleanness and of its health. But instead of such frank 
contact with nature, which is fundamentally necessary to 
awaken a true regard for the great facts of sex, he is stopped 
and blindfolded on the very threshold of his experience ; 
he is given fiction instead of truth, and filled with sophis- 
ticated and false ideas of modesty which eventually drive 
out genuine purity and reverence for truth. The child 
who has truth confided him as a precious gift will cherish 
and guard it, but the child who ferrets it out for himself 
with inquisitive suggestiveness will feel no responsibility 
for its keeping, but toss it about in boastful grossness. 
Ignorance is not purity, knowledge is not purity; but 
knowledge of facts colored with emotional reaction, rev- 
erent possession of truth, can never soil the mind. The 
child who in nature study holds some frail bit of life in 
his hands and reverently watches its beautiful unfoldment   will appreciate and champion its sacredness.

CHAPTER XVUI 
BUSY-WORK 
Busy-work occupies an unenviable position in the course 
of study. Its opponents call it “idiot’s delight”; its sup- 
porters smile inwardly and regard it as a necessary evil. 
It is a veritable Cinderella in the educational household, 
— tolerated because there is no available substitute. Like 
Cinderella, however, it only needs a fairy godmother to 
bring it to its own. Properly handled, busy-work offers 
endless opportunities for training. What can be done, then, 
to give it value? It must be so planned that it will give 
opportunity for independent thinking on the part of the 
child and enable him to reénforce, by his own effort, the 
knowledge or skill gained in previous recitations. Busy- 
work must do more than consume time; it must make wise 
use of it. It must not be administered as a kind of quiet- 
ing potion, to impress the superintendent when he makes 
his hurried rounds, but must be full of definite purpose. 
Busy-work, to be effective, must conform to certain con- 
ditions. It must present a problem commensurate with the 
ability of the child; it must afford sufficient variety to 
hold the attention of the child; the period of concentration 
must not be too long; the directions given when the task 
is assigned must be definite and simple ; the results accom- 
plished during the period must be noted by the teacher. 
Power develops in proportion to the effort expended. 
The utter absence of individual effort in an exercise of 
twenty-five minutes—the time usually allotted to the 
229
-P-A-G-E-240
  
  230 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
busy-work — is an irreparable loss. Laying sticks to make 
a pigeon house, which a child of three could do with his 
eyes closed, represents the character of a large portion of 
the work. What is the result of such vacuous occupation ? 
Young children are forming habits either of healthful 
activity, or of inconsequent dawdling, every day that they 
live. One chief reason why we find a lack of individual 
attack in study, an inability to concentrate, and a disin- 
tegrating languor in the upper’ grades is the pretense of 
industry and semblance of study in the first grade. 
The child who is not productively occupied necessarily 
hunts mischief as a relief. He steals a chance to disobey, 
to talk, or to destroy what he is oftentimes ashamed to have 
made. When children are allowed to manage their own 
time you never find them lounging for twenty-five minutes, 
or languidly gazing out of the window. Natural children 
keep wholesomely occupied. Their brains and hands are 
busy. They are plying questions, collecting oddities, or 
enjoying a well-earned rest. Busy-work often makes use of 
one tenth of a boy or girl, and leaves the other nine tenths 
actively in trouble, or humped up in an inert mass of crooked 
shoulders. On the contrary, the moment a child has a task 
to perform which is worthy of his effort, what happens? 
His body straightens up, his blood flows freely to his brain 
and tingles in his finger-tips. During lazy busy-work the 
child knows that he is merely being disposed of, that the 
task imposed is nominal, and that he is not responsible 
for its completion. Such a state of affairs breeds false 
conceptions of work. 
If you are not skillful enough to plan and direct this 
period, turn the children out to play vigorously in the yard. 
They will come back glowing with energy, not crippled with 
inertia. They will be set for work, not against it. Idleness
-P-A-G-E-241
  
BUSY-WORK 231 
is a habit. The boy or girl who is idle in busy-work will 
be idle in reading and arithmetic. But, on the contrary, 
energy wisely expended renews itself and accumulates 
power, which transfers itself into other lines of effort. 
From the teacher’s point of view alone, ineffectual busy- 
work means that the child’s natural output of energy is 
being diminished, and that his reaction to the next exer- 
cise will be retarded and more difficult» Initiative, per- 
severance, attention, and enthusiasm are necessary to 
success. These qualities are being wiped out by accu- 
mulated dawdling. They cannot be tapped just for read- 
ing and writing, but are the outcome of everyday habit and 
exercise. The whole problem is one of attitude, — atti- 
tude toward school and work until the love of independent 
effort becomes identified with the child’s character. It is 
a question of self-preservation for teachers to so direct 
these periods that they will improve rather than injure the 
working attitude of the children. 
We grow to like activities to which we were at first 
indifferent, because of their association with happy hours. 
This period should bring to the child a sense of satisfac- 
tion in work and achievement. It should excite a pride in 
the ability to begin and to complete a task without help, 
so that the child may feel the moral uplift of successful, 
independent effort. He should form a habit of expecting 
results and of holding self to account; for the duty of the 
primary school is to form habits of self-help, — habits which   will be useful to the child throughout his whole school life, 
not habits which will have to be broken as soon as he reaches 
the grammar grades. 
Do not try to force the very young children to study dur- 
ing this period, but give them the organized play material 
of the kindergarten, — material which calls for constructive  
-P-A-G-E-242
  232 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
activity. The little child is so undeveloped intellectually 
that he needs material full of such suggestiveness that it is 
easily transformed and will invite expression and invention. 
See that his problem requires him to compare, judge, and 
formulate some conclusion. He must learn to think before 
he learns to study. The mind of the unthinking child will 
lose its power to organize, and become as inconsequent as 
an atrophied muscle. How can busy-work be made to meet 
these requirements ? 
1. By discarding those boxes of small letters used to 
spell words, which are thrust at you every time busy-work 
is mentioned. These letters are enemies, not friends. Walk 
down the aisle of your room and see them standing on 
their heads, or pushing into the wrong place in the word, 
or taking up too much or too little space. You spend fifteen 
minutes presenting the correct visual and auditory impres- 
sion of words to be spelled, and then compel the children 
to spend twenty-five minutes looking at the distorted 
images which they construct out of these ugly little letters. 
If spelling must be taught, replace those letters by words 
and sentences, printed, or written in a bold, free hand. 
There are many occupations which will reénforce the spell- 
ing ; for instance, give every child two envelopes, — one con- 
taining pictures; the other, words which name the objects 
pictured. Allow the children during the busy-work period 
to match these on their desks. 
2. Make packs of cards, with pictures on one side and 
words on the other. Encourage the children to run through 
these packs until they can name all the words without 
looking at the pictures on the back of the cards. Perhaps 
they will not be able to do this the first time, but if the 
children know that they are allowed to look until they 
can name all the words without such help, instead of an 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  BUSY-WORK 233 
effort to cheat there will be an effort to perform the task, 
and a pride awakened in success. 
3. Write a short story on the board (three or four sen- 
tences can be made to tell a vital story, full of action and 
within the children’s reading capacity), which the chil- 
dren are to illustrate. Let them copy the story under their 
illustrations when they have completed them. When this 
is done they may use the words found in your story to 
write an original one, which they may also illustrate. Such 
occupation keeps the correct images of words before the 
children, enforces repetition of words, and incorporates 
them into the working vocabularies. 
4. Have the children tell something which happened on 
the playground, allowing them to draw pictures when they 
do not know how to spell the words. ‘These picture stories 
form a suggestive basis for word study the next day. 
5. Children should be allowed to make scrapbooks and 
to use this period occasionally to paste in pictures that 
appeal to them. By looking over these books, reading les- 
sons can be formulated about the pictures which will make 
use of all the “required words,” and at the same time in- 
sure intelligent rereading by the children. The children 
can then review the words contained in the stories by using 
them to label the pictures in their books. This labeling of 
objects is natural and childlike, and can be made use of in 
many ways to enlarge and reénforce the written vocabulary. 
These scrapbooks will be most individual and reflect the 
interests of each child; the vocabulary contained in each 
book will therefore be distinctive, and will increase tenfold 
the retentive power of the children’s minds by conforming 
to individual tastes. 
6. Write a list of suggestive words on the board.” The 
children may make as many stories as they can out of them.
-P-A-G-E-244
  234 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
7. Write simple questions on the board for the children 
to answer, either with a drawing or in words. This can be 
made a conversation between the teacher and the children, 
and is the beginning of letter writing. 
8. Draw a picture on the board, and write the necessary 
words to tell a story about it, in a column at the side. 
The children must tell the story. 
9. Give the children scissors to cut out pictures of words 
which have been written on the blackboard. Each child 
must write the correct word on the back of his pictures. 
In putting words on the blackboard always write the, or a, 
or an, before them, that the children may be accustomed 
to the use of the articles and be spared drill upon them 
apart from nouns. 
10. Sentence building, with written or printed words. 
The stories may be copied from the board by small chil- 
dren, and with the older children they may take the form 
of original stories about some definite thing. 
11. The children should be encouraged to begin dic- 
tionaries in the lower grades. Make books that are easily 
handled and leave wide spaces between the lines. At the 
top of each section paste, in large letters, one of the word 
endings, such as ate, and, at, ind, one, etc., and allow the 
children time to insert under these headings words which 
they have met in their reading lesson. 
12. Use storybooks, provided for the purpose and con- 
taining simply sight reading. Set problems for the chil- 
dren to solve; for instance, they might copy all the words 
which describe winter (or whatever the story is about) ; all 
the words that they can draw a picture of; all the words 
which tell them to do something. 
13. Put simple directions on the board which tell the 
children to make something — adding a simple diagram
-P-A-G-E-245
BUSY-WORK 235 
if necessary. This is easily begun in paper cutting; for 
instance, “Cut out a horse with a long tail. Cut out a boy 
and his dog,” ete., making the problem more difficult with 
the increasing power to read and to carry out directions. 
Whenever the reading can be made a means of real com- 
munication between teacher and pupil, it adds motive and 
interest. Children should not read just to let their teacher 
know that they can recognize the words by sight. 
14. Directed handwork where the children have a piece 
of work to do and know how to do it. Purposeful paper 
folding, paper cutting, free-hand sewing, stringing nature 
material, cutting patterns, or making designs for a definite 
purpose. Bring into the first grade as much kindergarten 
material as you know how to make use of, and set a defi- 
nite problem, in keeping with the child’s capacity. The few 
moments which it takes to plan and start the busy-work 
are well spent. A child should know that he will be held 
responsible for his time. He should work honestly or else 
rest completely. 
From the very beginning of school life the children 
should associate the classroom with happy, energetic work, 
and never with languid, waiting listlessness. Little chil- 
dren are not able to do much studying alone; they have 
neither the capacity nor the incentive. Much effort must 
be given then to plan these periods, and to see that the 
children are gaining and not losing in the power of inde- 
pendent application. The word “study” 
quently made use of in talking with little children, and should be fre- 
in connection with a variety of interesting problems, so 
that they may not associate study with an uninteresting, 
dog-eared book, out of which all the juice has been ex- 
tracted. “Study” means “attack”; it means the solution 
of delightful problems in handwork, reading, dramatic play,  
-P-A-G-E-246
  
  236 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
and games. If such terms as “Think it out,” “Find a way,” 
were used interchangeably with “study,” little children 
would begin their school life with a clearer idea of what it 
. Means to study. It is natural for a child to enjoy study 
if study means the solution of a problem. Children take a 
delight in success, whether it is in the classroom or on the 
playground. 
The business of the primary grades is not to give infor- 
mation, but to teach the children how to get it. To teach 
them how to work independently is of more importance 
than to teach them the technique of reading. The grammar 
grades and the high school need pupils who can think ; 
they have plenty who can memorize words. But they will 
continue to be surfeited with lip workers until the primary 
school agrees to train the thought powers of the child, until 
it makes use of its rare privilege to form happy associations 
in his mind with “ study” and “work.”
-P-A-G-E-247
  
CHAPTER XIX 
OUTDOOR PLAY 
There is in the elementary school a serious lack of the 
right kind of wholesome exercise for the younger children. 
The same pedagogy which applies to the intellectual work 
of the primary-school child should regulate his exercise. 
Just as formal drill and technique in the presentation of 
subject matter stultifies the deepest instincts and poten- 
tialities of the child’s mental life, so perfunctory, formal 
gymnastics impede his physical development. 
Children need spirited, playful, imaginative, dramatic 
exercise which makes a demand upon their whole nature, 
— exercise which utilizes in an instinctive way the large, 
muscular masses that effect respiration, digestion, and ex- 
cretion, which tone up the whole body through graceful, 
childlike abandon. The child’s desire for play leads him 
unconsciously into an active, spirited, rhythmical use of his 
large, fundamental muscles. Rhythm is a loved impulse in 
child life and, if incorporated into his exercise, will lead 
to grace and artistic delight. 
The kindergarten catches the child in the midst of this 
fluent, rhythmical expression, and lends a hand in rhythmic 
dances, ball plays, tiptoe games, and imitative and imagi- 
native exercises. So far so good; but what of the primary- 
school child, who is running over with the same deep tend 
encies and love of rhythmic play ? He is cut off from this 
expression and is too often allowed only the rough, unorgan- 
ized play of the recess hour, or the perfunctory shifting of 
237 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
  
  Y 
J 238 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
. arms and legs to the solemn “up, down, up, down,” of the 
tired teacher. For the lack of organized, spirited, dramatic 
play the primary-school child settles back on his heels and 
loses his innate buoyancy and grace. 
The young child loves life and motion. He can fly like 
a bird, hop like a frog, run as lightly as the quail. He has 
a reverent interest in the earth, and likes to imitate and 
understand all the industries and activities around him. He 
will dig, plant, and rake. He will build, climb, jump, run, 
and skip; he is versatile beyond all expression and needs 
only the suggestion of his environment, coupled with the 
childlike wisdom of an understanding comrade, to supply 
him with the truest and happiest exercise of his whole body. 
Why should the primary-school child, as soon as he leaves 
the kindergarten, be denied the inspiration of the piano? 
Why should he not continue to hear and express a variety 
of rhythmic moods? He is still a kindergarten child at 
heart and loves to march, run, skip, fly, dance, and swing 
to the persuasion of musical accompaniment. His exercise 
should continue to be joyous, graceful, free, exhilarating, 
unconscious. He cannot get it on the streets nor in the 
modern home. He must get it at the schools if he is to 
claim his proper heritage. 
The child tingles with definite muscular codrdinations ; 
movements which have been of use to the race in its 
struggle with nature survive as pregnant tendencies in his 
neuromuscular machinery. Folk games, rhythmic plays, 
and dances call these into action and set the whole body 
of the child into sympathetic vibration. The gymnasium 
of the primary school should therefore be a covered out- 
door pavilion with a piano and plenty of light and air. The 
children should dance, sing, march, walk, with vital step. 
- They should play with balls, — big balls, little balls, balls
-P-A-G-E-249
    OUTDOOR PLAY 239 
  to roll, to toss, to bounce, to throw into a bottomless basket. 
They should climb ladders, roll hoops, fly kites, toss bean 
bags, knock down tenpins, and play a variety of selected 
folk games, with their mimicry and suggestion. 
In a suggestive sentence in his book on “Age, Growth, 
and Death” Minot says: “When a cell is in the young 
state, it can grow rapidly ; it can multiply freely ; when it 
is in the old state, it loses those capacities, and its growth 
and multiplication are correspondingly impeded ; and if the 
organization is carried to an extreme, the growth and the 
multiplication will cease altogether.” Outdoor play, with 
its balanced, graceful, childlike use of the body, will create 
a reserve fund of energy, a deep well of health, from which 
the power to function accurately may be drawn later. But 
the child who substitutes organized physical drill for these 
more wholesome exercises is differentiating cells, not multi- 
plying them; he is wearing out his muscles prematurely, 
not building them up. 
If young children lived in an ideal atmosphere, where 
there was no interference with the wise plans of nature, 
the question of exercise would solve itself unconsciously 
in play, for play is the guardian of the child’s physical 
health and furnishes the normal stimulus to the various 
organs and nerve centers of the body; but modern insti- 
tutions, both social and educational, impose false conditions, 
and we must consciously set about to correct the compli- 
cations we create. We must use certain definite gymnastic 
exercises to correct contracted chests and invite the res- 
     
           
piratory organs to take in their normal quantity of oxygen. 
  We are responsible for the bad postures and sluggish circu- 
lation which follow poor ventilation and confinement. We 
must therefore start the blood flowing naturally by the use 
of corrective, formal gymnastic exercises. But, even these 
            
-P-A-G-E-250
   
   
               
   
           
        
      
    
           
      
        
       240 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
must be enjoyed with spirit and laughter if we would 
accomplish results, and the amount of time given to such 
work depends upon the gravity of the false conditions 
which you yourself permit in your own classroom. 
The startling results of the open-air schools have con- 
vinced us that growing children are as dependent upon 
pure air as upon wholesome food. But we are victims of 
an indoor habit, and it takes courage to be true to our con- 
victions. A good way to begin, however, would be to 
oxygenate the primar 
  school child by holding every pos 
sible session outdoors, and by turning him out to play when- 
ever the indoor busy-work proves unprofitable. Educate 
his sense of smell and respiratory organs so that he will 
rebel against confinement in a close, ill-ventilated room as 
he would against a shoe that pinches. 
Children would return to their work vitalized and buoy- 
ant if short out-of-door intermi: 
  ions were encouraged. It 
is conceded that we are a nervous, irritable people. One 
s is a lack of 
oxygen. As certain chemical experiments go to prove, the 
nervous sy! 
body, requires oxygen. of the prime causes of this undue nervousnes   
stem, perhaps more than any other organ in the 
  For many reasons children need short, intensive periods 
of work interspersed with many intermissions for fresh air 
and play. Dr. W. H. Burnham, in his article, “The Hygiene 
of Physical Education” (American Physical Education Re- 
view, Vol. XIV), says: 
the aim of physical training is the development of habits 
of healthful activity (using the word ‘habit’ in its broadest 
sense): habits of digestion, excretion; habits of storing and “From the point of view of hygiene 
  expending energy ; habits of codrdination and control; and 
even the reflexes of the sympathetic nervous system, as 
    well as the reactions of the central nervous system... .
-P-A-G-E-251
  
OUTDOOR PLAY 241 
Hygiene demands special consideration of the development 
of four of the most important organs of the body,— the 
heart, the lungs, the digestive apparatus, and the nervous 
system. ... The natural form of lung gymnastics is free 
play out of doors.... If the lungs are not developed 
properly in early life, the defect is not likely to be remedied 
afterwards.” Again, Dr. Burnham says: “The consensus 
of expert opinion is to the effect that the best means of 
developing the fundamental nerve centers are the various 
forms of free play ; and it is noteworthy that nearly all the 
movements made by children in their spontaneous plays 
are those involving these centers, and that the accessory 
movements are rare and few in number... . Plays should 
be recreative and should not stimulate to great nervous 
discharge.” 
A child should never use his muscles languidly, but with 
the intoxication of delight, if he is to benefit by that use. 
G. Stanley Hall says: “ Muscles are in a most intimate and 
peculiar sense the organs of the will.... Character might 
in a sense be defined as a plexus of motor habits. ... Skill, 
endurance, and perseverance might almost be called muscu- 
lar virtues, and fatigue, velleity, caprice, ennui, restlessness, 
lack of control and poise, muscular faults.” Should not 
this truth cause the primary school to look to the normal 
muscular health of its children? Is it not a commentary 
upon civilization to read that savages are superior to civi- 
lized man in correct or esthetic proportions of the body ? 
The savage uses his body in fluent expression of his emo- 
tional life. “The psychomotor impulses which prompt 
play are the forms in which our forbears have transmitted 
to us their habitual activities.”VThe child who is denied 
the expression of his play instincts never comes into his 
heritage of bodily and mental health, but is the victim of  
-P-A-G-E-252
242 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
the nervous irritation of inhibited tendencies. Play will 
néither allow the muscles of the body to become flabby 
nor develop them in technical skill, but will establish 
that balance between exercise and rest which results in 
a harmonious growth of all its parts. 
The child’s mood is king, his body only the servant. 
Turn the pages of Gulick’s delightful book, “'The Health- 
ful Art of Dancing,” 
ous illustrations. Happiness is the vitalizing energy of 
child life. It will chase out all idleness and listless awk- 
wardness, and set the body in harmonious accord. The lovely and catch the contagion of its joy- 
children dancing on the roof in Gulick’s book are express- 
ing vibrant joy, and their bodies have taken on elasticity 
and charm. What we need in all of our work is this en- 
ticing spirit of the dance, glowing abandon, unconscious 
loveliness. Childhood’s veins are full of it, and free out- 
door play and the rhythmic folk dance will perpetuate it 
to the race.

CHAPTER XX 
MORNING EXERCISES 
   
   
   
                     
    
           Look at the beginning of any piece of work and you 
can foretell the character of its end. Attend the morning 
exercises in any schoolroom and you can predict what the 
day’s work will be. 
Children of primary-school age are forming attitudes 
toward work and play, toward life as they live from day 
to day. They are piling up fundamental experiences, each 
one of which will leave behind it an emotional tone. The 
sum of these experiences and responses constitutes char- 
acter, personality. As a child thinketh, so is he, and the 
response to the morning exercise becomes the child himself. 
|The variety of his impressions and the spontaneity of his 
responses establish habitual reactions and habitual atti- 
tudes and points of view. A child is different who has 
these brief expressions of joy or sudden moments of con- 
scious seriousness, or who cannot refrain from bursts of 
wholesome laughter. 
Variety in emotional expression is as necessary as variety 
in diet, and the morning exercises afford the opportunity 
for such variety. The child is more alert, more sensitive, 
more plastic in the morning. He has not yet fixed his day’s 
attitude by unfortunate omissions. He is susceptible to im- 
pressions and suggestions. The frankness and informality 
lof the period invite individual expression and necessitate 
individual contact. The morning exercises, then, should be 
ull of variety. This is why we do not sanction the reading 
243
-P-A-G-E-254
    244 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
of one continued story. Such work is more advantageously 
presented during the literature period. Undoubtedly the 
children will be interested, but they are intent upon a nar- 
rative, an action, receiving for the most part only one im- 
pression. The morning exercises should start a variety of 
     
                   
   
             
    
   
    
   
   impressions, touch upon a number of suggestive experi- 
ences, call out individual expression, and give the children 
many points of view. Small bits of verse, such as one finds 
’ or “Tree Tops and Meadows,” make in the “ Posy Ring,’ 
such a course possible. Read four or five lines of a serious | 
sort, then a line or two of laughter, then a bit of pure rip- 
pling nonsense sound, then the odd bits which reflect the 
consequences of familiar childlike faults. These are imper- 
sonal, and, because they are not consciously aimed at the 
erring boy or girl, excite deeper reflection. 
“Morning exercises,” then, is the time for a kind of touch 
and go, —a dropping of hints, convictions, suggestions, and 
comments. It is the time to fire the imagination and loose 
the spirit of childhood. We are sometimes too much con-| 
cerned with what is in the minds of little children, and too 
unconscious of what is in their hearts. Look into your 
children’s faces; know the habitual expression of each 
one, that you may haye a starting point for persuasion 
and development. 
Know the habitual physical expression peculiar to each] 
child, for there is a normal physical tone reflected in body} 
and mind. Watch its variations, that you may attribut 
unusual conduct to unusual conditions. If you know th 
physical and mental tone of each of the children, — the ex 
pected individual reactions, 
to correct discrepancies. The lack of breakfast, lack of suffi 
cient sleep, or the resultant irritability of a nervous hurr 
to school will utterly. demoralize the best child. If th   
it is easier to account for an
-P-A-G-E-255
  
MORNING EXERCISES 245 
teacher does not recognize these artificial conditions, and 
find an opportunity to establish the child’s habitual reac- 
tions by a moment of composure, rest,-or food, the work    
    
   
                                           
   
   of the whole day will be disfigured. 
Sometimes a child’s mood or mental state must be changed 
by the morning exercise before he can work well. Perhaps, 
before he left for school, he was roughly handled at home, 
or he has been teased on his way by some older boy, or 
he has met with some accident to book or toy or clothes. 
These are trivial sorrows from our point of view, but they 
can make the world a desolate place for a child to live in. 
The emotional tone which these unfortunate experiences 
have established must be driven out, and a hopeful, self- 
confident, working attitude let in. The boy who failed yes- 
terday must feel success to-day, if it is only by telling a 
short experience or by showing some cherished toy. Toys 
are precious possessions which are tied to children’s hearts. 
The boy who shows his gun, and the girl who shows her 
new doll, lets you into secret places, and throws the barrier 
down. One can slip into a young mother’s heart by feeling 
an interest in her new baby; one can slip into a child’s 
heart by frank enjoyment of his toys. It is all possession, 
after all, and who would not possess a little new wagon or 
  a shining gun! These are the intimate, personal possessions 
of childhood, which bear the stamp of the owner. If you 
cannot without self-consciousness roll a hoop, spin a top, or 
croon a doll to sleep, you have never learned the language 
lof childhood, and you are a stranger in a foreign land. 
Little children are delicate instruments, and they must be 
elicately handled, that their sensitiveness and possibili- 
ies may balance one another. Children are individualistic, 
ersonal, intimate; the teacher of children must enter into 
hese experiences and imaginations of selfhood. She cannot  
-P-A-G-E-256
  246 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
deny children intimate contact if she would be of any sery- 
ice to them. The first fifteen minutes of the day is the time | 
for such contact, — for companionship, unconscious direc- 
tion, and subtle suggestion. It is the time to bring into the 
classroom the sunlight, the freedom, and the naiveté of the 
outdoors. It is the time to start observations, questions, 
and reflections. It is the time to set definite problems of 
self-government, and to establish a tradition in the room 
which will become like the air one breathes, and which will 
be the pride of every individual. 
Where it is possible, assign a few morning tasks; a 
committee allowed to come in before school to look things 
over, to fix the erasers and chalk, to feed the pets and water 
        
            
   
              
     
       the flowers, takes on a pride of ownership and responsibility 
which establishes moral attitudes. Let it be a privilege to 
contribute to the general comfort in this way, and allow 
no one’s name to appear on such a committee who has 
not a good weekly record. 
The morning exercise is the time to establish standards 
of cleanliness, and persistence in good physical habits in 
regard to sleep, food, and elimination. It should foster 
respect for private property, a pride in ownership, and a 
measure of personal responsibility toward the general con- 
duct of the school. Every child should have a pride in 
being dependable and self-reliant. These are the things that 
build the morality of childhood, and all the preaching in the 
world will never make up for the unconscious influence of 
the teacher during this period of intimate confidence. 
Children need ideals, not punishment. It is the teacher’ 
fault when the boys and girls are dirty, slouchy, and gener 
ally unkempt. The boy who knows that there is some on 
who will look for and expect clean hands and face sooy 
sets a new ideal for himself. A crooked part in the hair
-P-A-G-E-257
  
MORNING EXERCISES 247 
and islands of dirt still clinging around his eyes and nose, 
will testify to his first conscious struggles. It is worth 
while for the teacher to be vigilant, for the beautiful, clean 
body is a safeguard against an unclean mind. Make a stand- 
ard, then, for the children to live up to, — not a rule but an 
ideal, —and watch the crude scramble to reach it. You can- 
not command children all the time, but you can by sugges- 
tion, interest, and encouragement set the tide of a whole 
room surging toward a desired end. The dirtiest boy in the 
room will astonish you some morning by appearing desper- 
ately clean, with a flower in his buttonhole. 
Little children must be led to the fulfillment of their 
possibilities through a firm faith in the unselfish affection 
of those who care for them. The child is controlled by 
love. He understands love, for his heart is running over 
with it. It is incorporated into his being, for it was the 
force which first gave him life, and it is the energy which 
will continue to drive him on to excel himself. 
The briefness and the informality of the morning exer- 
cise make it a tremendous influence in the life of the child. 
Pedagogy cannot be measured by hours or minutes, for a 
child often develops more in a moment of joyous personal 
contact than in hours of conscious teaching.
-P-A-G-E-258
  CHAPTER XXT 
DISCIPLINE 
After all, what is discipline? It is not rule, rote, and 
silence, but the establishment of a working attitude in 
one’s classroom. What is disorder? It is only that which 
interferes with the progress or the comfort of any member 
of the class. 
\. To maintain discipline (and according to the definition 
above it is absolutely essential to success) one must first 
study the health of the children. Discipline, if analyzed, 
would be found to include ventilation, light, heat, rest, and 
cleanliness. Discipline is unconsciously affected by environ- 
ment; even the appearance of the room is an item of con- 
cern. A vase of beautiful flowers arranged with an eye to 
color and proportion may be made a source of control. 
Children are deeply sensitive to their surroundings, and may 
absorb disorder and irritability both from the teacher and 
the general atmosphere of the room in which they work, 
Orderly mental habits hover over the boy or girl who has 
orderly physical habits, and, other things being equal, the 
clean child in the clean, attractive room will be well behaved. 
The apathy of the average classroom creates first a nega- 
tive attitude and then open rebellion. (Good discipline is a 
question of attitude. Children need positive direction, and 
the undirected pretense of study in the early grades, before 
the children are capable of independent study, is the breed 
ing ground of discontent and immorality. We are forgettin: 
that it is not learning how to read that counts, but learnin 
248
-P-A-G-E-259
  
DISCIPLINE 249 
how to think and to study. The study periods of the pri- 
mary-school child should be wisely directed, for the ability 
to study is the foundation of all later intellectual progress. } 
Obedience is not a birthright of children. It is not like 
the gold or silver spoon put into the mouth, but comes to 
them slowly, growing as they grow, until it becomes habitual 
to be law-abiding. Disobedience, likewise, is not inherent. 
It is frequently a good impulse turned in a wrong direction. » 
( Many children are not intentionally disobedient, but have a 
‘career of carelessness which results in absent-mindedness, 
anegative attitude toward obligations, and a general moral 
incapacity. Such a child can be made obedient only bya) 
patient rebuilding of habits. One should not put the same 
exactions upon him as upon the child who comes from the 
orderly home. The latter has absorbed the power to obey 
with his mother’s milk. Regular physical habits of nourish- 
ment and sleep have laid the foundation for his orderly moral 
response. The other child must undo the habit of five or six 
years of shiftlessness, to take on the habits of order and con- 
trol. Only the wise and sympathetic teacher can help him to 
do this. He must be led from one success to another, with a 
consciousness of victory that is pleasurable. The habitually 
disorderly child, who is plunged into the school routine and 
expected to respond to all of its regulations at once, feels a 
sense of defeat that results in an antagonistic attitude 
toward school and hampers his progress. We are learning to 
grade children a little more wisely according to their mental 
power, and we must now learn to grade them morally. 
The conventional morality of childhood is not a thing com- 
plete in itself. It is, after all, only the past habitual response 
of the individual to law and order. It is the result of training, 
not of inheritance. &fiie child who comes to school unruly 
must therefore be looked upon not with dislike but simply X
-P-A-G-E-260

as deficient. He should be treated with the same consider- 
ation as the child who has missed a half year by sickness, 
or who has been moved about from place to place and is 
behind his grade in specific subjects. Make the problem in 
_ discipline for the individual child within his capacity, just 
as you do his reading or writing lesson; then see that he 
solves it. ) 
Moral power must grow as mental power does, with the 
opportunity to use it. The gospel of good discipline lies in 
_first_making the child willing to do the right thing. The 
teacher’s will, however strong, cannot control the child’s 
conduct ; he must do that himself, and he will do it if he 
is permitted to see that good conduct is a personal pos- 
session that works to his own advantage. Children’s stand- 
ards are not altruistic; they are guided by consequences, 
and legitimate punishment should deal with such personal 
and practical consequences. 
Children are considered disobedient when there is abso- 
lutely no conscious desire to disobey. A whole army of dis- 
orderly habits, laying siege to motor impulses, must make 
disorderly behavior automatic. The study of the psychol- 
ogy of habit opens our eyes to the fact that disobedience is 
as reflex in some children as their respiration. 
Again, many children are hard to control because, in a 
kind of self-defense from inopportune and incessant correc- 
tion, they have learned to close their ear traps and shut out all 
remonstrance. They frequently do not hear directions and 
suggestions. Commands.do not penetrate their central nerv- 
ous system, but merely slide along that proverbial path from 
ear to ear. Obedience is then often a mere matter of con- 
centration, attention ; and if you will observe the disobedient 
child at his work, he is equally unable to concentrate there. 
The question is, then, What kind of correction does he 
 
-P-A-G-E-261
  
DISCIPLINE 251 
need ? Does he need to be punished for individual offenses, 
or does he need to be trained to concentrate ? The solution 
lies in training. Many a child, taught to apply himself in 
independent study, is made thereby obedient. 
The moral law of childhood is physical, social, and per- 
sonal. It is a question of habit, public opinion, and personal 
application. You cannot train the moral impulse of a child 
abstractly, any more than you can train his intellect so. 
Moral training, like mental training, must be concrete, daily, 
by example and practice, beginning with small victories and 
Many of the chil-   leading toward larger responsibilities,/ 
dren, before they come to school, have never had a definite 
required task. Such children need immediately to be given 
the charge of some school pet, or the care of some article in 
the room, that the task, however simple, may require daily 
attention and give concrete, daily evidence of any neglect. 
The effects of the child’s play life have been immediate, 
visible. He has a basis of judgment in regard to it, and 
forms his likes and dislikes accordingly. Now the results of 
his daily living must be visible, personal, immediate, if he 
is to grow in moral perception. 
Look to the moral capacity of the individual child when 
you discipline him, just as you do to his mental capacity 
when you grade him, He must be led from the spot at 
which you find him, and cannot be forced to leap over the 
intervening space by the whip of discipline. Even if fear 
forces him to cover the ground, he will backslide, for there 
is no sure foundation beneath his feet. 
(imitation and suggestion are the avenues of approach ; 
commands, when these fail. Much of the disorder and un- 
rest in the classroom is due to the teacher’s instability, 
unevenness, and unsteady hand. The demands made of 
little children must be steady, invariable, and progressive, V V+ 
a 
 
-P-A-G-E-262
  252 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
that by much repetition the children may acquire funda- 
mental and habitual responses. /Children have learned to 
read and write by repetition; by the same process they 
must learn the personal habits that constitute morality. 
Children have little morality so-called. They are as in- 
different to the social sins as they are to offenses against 
language forms. The only difference is that we recognize 
the latter and proceed to awaken a language conscience 
through an appeal to the sensitive ear. We must recognize 
the former and awaken a moral conscience by a persistent 
appeal to the heart and mind of the child. 
The man who told his boy that at 10 a.m. the following 
Wednesday he would give him a sound whipping for some 
offense committed was extreme, but he offers a suggestion. 
Children cannot be corrected with effect when their whole 
body is vibrating with anger and the motor impulses are 
necessarily too strong for resistance. That intensity of feel- 
ing must be given time to spend itself and a normal func- 
tioning be resumed, if reason and kindliness are to ‘be 
substituted as motives. Many a kicking, screaming child, 
allowed time to go apart, to wash his face, to sit alone 
awhile, will return docile and open to conviction. Healthy- 
mindedness must be allowed to assert itself before correc- 
tion or punishment is put in force. Emotion lies close to 
the will, and the child must be led, by love and suggestion, 
to the development of standards of choice which reason can 
formally support and the will execute. 
It is necessary that a teacher who would understand her 
children should follow them to the playground and there 
study their temperamental reactions. She will get insight 
that the classroom will never afford. On the playground 
the friendships which are the sources of temptation become 
apparent. Perhaps two children with exactly the same faults
-P-A-G-E-263
  DISCIPLINE 253 
to overcome have been sitting side by side in school, each 
fortifying the other in weakness. A change of position in 
school hours is often the ounce of prevention that brings a 
pound of cure. Again, certain children with individual 
peculiarities antagonize one another. Incompatibility of 
temper exists between certain natures, and persists, do what 
you will. One cannot expect a child to come to his first 
experiences with such incompatibility, steeled in self-control. 
He should not be made conscious of these differences in 
temperament, but the wise teacher will not leave unneces- 
sary sources of irritation in the way of little children, any 
more than she will wear a pebble in her own shoe. “The 
child’s heart is stocked with love, joy, helpfulness, faith, 
wonder, fear, anger, and love of power. These instinctive 
reactions, so evident on the playground, should form the 
basis of discipline and control, — each in its due proportion, 
for the task of education is to assist and patiently wait for 
natural development. 
The formality of the average classroom encourages dis- 
obedience. The teacher who overburdens the children with 
rules and regulations invites rebellion. A natural impulse 
toward order is frequently inhibited by too much prescrip- 
tion. Some well-meaning teachers, by too much negative 
suggestion, call out a new list of juvenile offenses every 
day. There is a strain of perversity in human nature which, 
if provoked, swells into obstinacy and armed resistance. 
Beware that you have your class with you and not against 
you, for children catch the mood of their companions and 
are very versatile in their ways of signifying it. 
2 Social_cobperation and hygienic living will do more to 
provoke moral energy than all the punishment that can 
be devised. But social codperation means a wholesome 
emotional response, not silence and constant repression.
-P-A-G-E-264
    254 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
Emotional response is as necessary to moral growth as the 
circulation of the blood is to physical growth. To secure 
this wholesome emotional response, however, some changes 
must be made in the school routine. First, we must put an 
end to the nervous competition and struggle for existence, 
which begins even with the babies, and which develops in- 
sistent selfishness. For instance, it means doing away with 
spelling lessons beyond the children’s capacity, which lead 
to the first successful misrepresentations, to untruth and 
aggressive selfhood. Wit and shrewdness count for success 
in the struggle for life. In the average classroom, with its 
system of rules and tests of knowledge, the struggle for 
existence is as keen as in the animal world. What wonder, 
then, that the shrewdness and mother wit of childhood step 
in to win success at the expense of fair play. Neither in 
the animal nor in the child is there conscious morality ; 
survival of the fittest is the watchword, and the animal 
steals the coveted bone as naturally as the child looks on 
his neighbor’s paper. Children, by the severity of the re- 
quirements in school, are put into temptation before they 
have been taught to discriminate between methods, or have 
established an ethical relation between means and ends. 
What wonder that they use the most expeditious way. 
Why should we expect such sensitive moral choice with- 
out the long experiences out of which choice is born? Is 
choice in form and color so evident ? Go into the homes of 
the untutored and look at the combinations of color. Their 
eyes are not offended by them; their choice is made with- 
out experience to guide them. Follow the American public 
in its choice of Christmas presents, and draw your own 
conclusions. Why should we delude ourselves into think- 
ing that moral choice comes ready-made any more than 
standards of beauty in color and form ?
-P-A-G-E-265
DISCIPLINE 255 
One more suggestion, simple but often neglected: much 
punishment would be avoided in the primary school_if 
teachers were more sensitive to the signs of approaching 
“disease. Mumps, for instance, disfigures a co s behavior 
long before it does his face. 
There is a psychologieal attitude toward the problems 
of discipline. which will be a comfort as well as a service 
to the teacher. It will make her point of view impersonal 
and interpretative. It will induce less restraint and provoke 
more freedom, for discipline that depends upon desks that 
are screwed to the floor, and an orderly arrangement of 
chairs, does not promote moral health. 
Children work with their whole bodies and should be 
encouraged to take easy, natural positions, for the more 
mobile their bodies, the greater their power of absorption 
and expression. The atmosphere of a classroom, however, 
is a subtle thing and depends largely upon_the tempera- 
ment of the teacher. Even in the most modern kinder- 
garten, where there are tables and chairs and plenty of 
space and sunshine, one may see the most pitifully ortho- 
dox behavior. The great teacher is superior to her equip- 
ment and projects her spirit into the conduct of her room. 
She knows how to establish a working attitude which will 
awaken spontaneous attack and keep every child occupied 
to his fullest capacity. 
The word “discipline” should be construed to mean 
“nurture”; that is, the care and sustenance necessary to 
physical, moral, and mental growth. Such a conception of 
discipline would allow the children a natural, fearless ex- 
pression of body and mind. It would establish a homelike 
atmosphere in our schools, which would result in definite 
benefit to both teacher and pupil. The average teacher 
needs a freer environment to persuade her to relax, and 
K ~: he

256 PEDAGOGY OF THE PRIMARY SCHOOL 
when architects and building committees use more courage 
and ingenuity in the construction of our school buildings, 
we shall have less difficulty with discipline. 
/ In conclusion, then, the moral life of children hinges upon 
/the subtle influences of daily living. The good cheer, the 
unselfishness, and the general moral tone of the home and 
the school slowly and certainly build up the moral fiber of 
childhood. The child’s standards of right and wrong are 
not formed to-morrow, but yesterday and to-day, out of     
the joys, sorrows, duties, sacrifices, and companionships 
of daily living. Social contact builds up a sense of honor 
and a legitimate pride which all the formal ethics in the 
- world cannot instill.

PART FOUR 
THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
CHAPTER XXII 
PESTALOZZI AND HOME EDUCATION 
Following is a passage chosen from Pestalozzi’s greatest 
book, “ Leonard and Gertrude.” Arner, the magistrate of 
Bonnal, in company with the Lieutenant, is standing on a 
high mountain, from which he views his domain. 
“The placid Itte which flowed at their feet was shim- 
mering in the purest silvery light; the sun was sinking, 
and the liquid mirror of the sinuous stream glittered from 
the village of Bonnal far out to the end of the blue moun- 
tains, which, like a great curtain, shut off Arner’s land 
from the world beyond. For a while Arner contemplated 
the scene in silence, and then abruptly said, ‘Ah, man- 
kind is so ugly, and no matter what we may do for men 
we can never bring it to pass that they will ever be beauti- 
ful as is this valley’; and the spectacle of the valley in the 
sunset was indeed a glorious one. ‘But that is not true,’ 
objected the Lieutenant; and as he spoke there appeared, 
at the base of the rock on which they stood, a shepherd 
youth driving before him a poor, lean goat. He stopped 
still at their feet and looked off toward the setting sun, 
leaned upon his crook, and sang an evening song. He 
was the very image of beauty, and mountain and valley, 
257 
 
-P-A-G-E-268
  258 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
thé stream and the sunset, vanished before their eyes, for 
now they saw only this ragged shepherd boy, and Arner 
said, ‘I was wrong. The beauty of man is the highest 
beauty on earth.’” 
This passage, which is even more beautiful in the original 
German, transports us into Switzerland, gives us at once a 
glimpse into the poetic and perhaps somewhat sentimental 
soul of its author, and strikes the keynote of his character. 
When Arner says, in the presence of the sunset and the 
mountains, that there is nothing nobler in this world than 
man, he is speaking for Pestalozzi. 
In one of his letters Pestalozzi himself says, “I looked 
with admiration from the height of Gyrnigel upon the 
immense valley with its mountain border, and yet at that 
very moment thought more of the badly instructed people 
it contained than of the beautiful scenery. I could not, 
nor would J, live without accomplishing my aim.” 
This is more than mere emotional vaporizing, for the 
whole life of Pestalozzi bears out his words. He had an 
enthusiasm for humanity, and he lived out his ideas. He 
simply could not hold his instinct of brotherhood in check, 
and herein lies his genius. If genius is insanity, we shall 
have to express it this way: he was a monomaniac domi- 
nated and swayed by one impulse, — love for his fellow 
man; he had one fixed idea, — the regeneration of human- 
ity; and if it was a case of delusional insanity, he had one 
persistent delusion, — a faith in the educability of mankind. 
Indeed,- during his lifetime people more than once 
doubted his sanity, and predicted that he would end his 
days in a madhouse. Others who were more charitable 
explained that he engaged in the menial trade of school- 
master because he had fallen into poverty. At any rate, 
before he died, even such conservatives as kings and
-P-A-G-E-269
  
PESTALOZZI AND HOME EDUCATION 259 
princes recognized something of the sanity of the great 
ideas that were announced by this peculiar-looking, pecu- 
*“ liar-acting Swiss schoolmaster, with that strange-sounding 
Italian name, and to-day almost all the world is ready to 
assent to the epitaph inscribed above his tomb: 
Here lies Heinrich Pestalozzi 
Born in Zurich on the 12th of January, 1746 
Died in Brugg on the 17th of February, 1827 
Savior of the poor at Neuhof 
Preacher to the people in “Leonard and Gertrude” 
Father of the fatherless in Stanz 
Founder of the new elementary school at Burgdorf 
and Miinchenbuchsee 
Educator of humanity in Yverdon 
Man, Christian, Citizen. 
Everything for others, nothing for himself. 
Blessings be upon his name. 
This epitaph recalls the landmarks of a long, active career 
of eighty-one years. Pestalozzi lived in an age that liter- 
ally teemed with great men, ideas, and events. In America 
the struggle for individual freedom was largely political 
and culminated in a revolutionary war. It expressed itself 
in the self-evident phrases of Rousseau’s philosophy, a 
philosophy destined to be the mouthpiece of another revo- 
lution still more comprehensive. In Germany there was 
a peculiar little man, about as large as Pestalozzi, by name 
Immanuel Kant, who shed tears of joy over these two 
revolutions, —the one in Paris, the other across the sea, 
—and constructed a philosophy which itself was pro- 
foundly revolutionary. This philosophy, if it did anything, 
emphasized the dignity of the individual and the possibili- 
ties of his creative self-activity. Fichte, the earliest ex- 
ponent of Kantianism, and personal friend of Pestalozzi, 
declared that Kant’s philosophy coincided exactly with the
-P-A-G-E-270
  260 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
fundamental principles laid down in “Leonard and Ger- 
trude.” There was much sympathy among the great men 
of this period of Aufkldérung. 
But, marked as was the intellectual activity in Germany, 
the awakening in Switzerland during the last half of the 
eighteenth century was, if anything, more brilliant. Tre- 
mendous powers were concentrated on Swiss soil during 
that period. Rousseau, a native of Geneva, after his 
“Emile” had been publicly burned by the hangman, fled 
to the Swiss Alps. Voltaire also found a retreat there. 
Edward Gibbon completed his great history in Lausanne. 
Madame de Staél held an intellectual court in a castle on a 
Swiss lake. Kleist, the Swiss literary scholar, could write, 
in 1752, “Whereas in great Berlin there are not more than 
three or four men of taste and genius, in little Zurich there 
are twenty or thirty”; and Zurich, be it remembered, was 
Pestalozzi’s birthplace and college town. The doctrine of 
the simple life, and the Wolffian philosophy, which preached 
a return to nature, were in special favor at Zurich, and 
found ardent disciples at the university. Breitinger and 
Bodmer, the advocate of republican liberalism, were two 
inspiring teachers, and gathered about them groups of 
eager students, Pestalozzi among others. Sometimes they 
would all assemble as a revolutionary organization called 
the Helvetic society. 
In this feverish, utopian atmosphere Pestalozzi lived out 
his adolescence. It must have been a congenial atmosphere 
for his ardent soul. Even as a lad he had shown a preco- 
cious reforming instinct. When a mere boy he was im- 
pressed by the good deeds of his grandfather, the village 
pastor, and announced, “ When I am big, I am going to be 
a pastor too, and side with the peasants.” And so at the 
university he studied theology, but fortunately broke down 
 
-P-A-G-E-271
  
PESTALOZZI AND HOME EDUCATION 261 
in the middle of his trial sermon. He then decided in favor 
of law, promising to help the peasants in the court, but 
his also did not suit. Next he turned to the Jeffersonian 
ideal of agriculture, hoping to show what the sunken peas- 
ants might do for themselves in the noble art of farming ; 
but as a practical agriculturalist he only registered another 
ailure. His friend Schinz has an explanation: “who in his 
thought at the stars stumbles into a quagmire at his feet, 
who can neither talk to nor act with any of his fellow crea- 
ures without offending them with his unpleasant exterior 
and his uncouth, disorderly ways, — how can such a man 
ever hope to be able to get on in actual life.” As it was, 
Pestalozzi wrote in his diary, in 1775, “The dream of my 
ife — the hope of making my house the center of a sphere 
of benevolent activity — was gone.” 
But in reality this dream was just about to be realized, 
or no sooner had his agricultural project fallen flat than 
he converted the roof above his head into a shelter for 
neglected children, thus finding, for the first time, adequate 
expression for his philanthropic passion. He started at 
Neuhof the first industrial pauper school known in history. 
But how explain this strange, unheard-of notion of open- 
ing the door of your own home and gathering in all the   
  
vagabonds from the highways ? Why under the sun should 
a bankrupt farmer who cannot keep himself out of poverty 
presume to take care of other paupers? This very proper 
question received very especial emphasis from the rela- 
tives, the neighbors, and the prudent generally. Even 
to-day it is an eminently pertinent question for the stu- 
dent of Pestalozzi, and De Guimps is right in seeking the 
answer in the fact that four years before this a son had 
been born to Mr. and Mrs. Pestalozzi. They shed many 
tears of joy at the event, and in his diary the father makes
-P-A-G-E-272
262 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
this entry: “Thou God who hast made me the father of 
an immortal soul . . . send me Thy spirit from on high. 
Give me now new strength, create in me a new heart, 
fresh zeal, oh, my son, my son!” 
The experience of parenthood worked a revolution in 
Pestalozzi’s thinking, leading him to realize the significance 
of childhood for the individual and society. In the light 
of that new realization the opening of the pauper school 
at Neuhof is comprehensible. Though the undertaking out- 
wardly failed, it was in reality a deep success. After five 
years’ association with the children, Pestalozzi said: “I knew 
the people as no one else did, and I never was more pro- 
foundly impressed by the fundamental truth on which I had 
based my efforts than when I saw that I had failed. I have 
proved that children, after having lost health, strength, 
and courage in a life of idleness and mendacity, have, when 
once set to regular work, quickly recovered: their strength 
and spirits and grown rapidly. I have found that even the 
most depraved of them are touched by kindness.” 
Neuhof must be considered the most Pestalozzian insti. 
tution he ever managed. Here he could be as he wanted 
to be, a father to his children. He clothed them, fed them, 
and treated them in every way as his own. There were some 
fifty of them in the family, ranging from four to nineteen 
years of age. De Guimps’s description follows: ‘They were 
always with him, sharing in the work of the field and of the 
house, and in bad weather spinning cotton in a large shed. 
Very little time was given to actual lessons. Indeed, the 
children were often taught while working with their hands, 
| Pestalozzi being in no hurry to teach them to read and 
write, convinced as he was that this is only useful for those 
who have learned to talk. He gave them constant prac- 
tice in conversation, however, on subjects taken from their 
 
-P-A-G-E-273
  
PESTALOZZI AND HOME EDUCATION 263 
everyday life, and made them repeat passages from the 
Bible until they knew them by heart.” It must have been 
a very unconventional school, headed as it was by a school- 
master so unconventional that he slighted the three R’s and 
went about chewing the end of his necktie, 
Bankruptcy and derision could not shake his faith. The 
very year of his failure he began to publish his convictions 
on the subject of education. “Evening Hours of a Hermit” 
and “Leonard and Gertrude” appeared in close succes- 
sion. Zschokke says of the latter, “ Everything that he after- 
wards wrote—yes, his whole life —was but the expounding 
and explaining of this one book.” And indeed, Pestalozzi, 
although he had fifty years yet to live, never got far beyond 
the principles embodied in that great, true novel. It will 
therefore be unnecessary for us to trace a course of pro- 
gressive development throughout his long career, for there 
was none. He held fast to the fundamental conceptions 
of his early manhood. 
And what were these fundamental conceptions? They 
are not, as a rule, satisfactorily stated, for Pestalozzi has 
been interpreted altogether too much in the terms of our 
own conyentional conceptions of education and of the sup- 
posed influence he has had on the course of its develop- 
ment. Ordinarily it is believed that Pestalozzi advocated 
love between master and pupil, observance of the order of 
nature in teaching, sense perception as the basis of instruc- 
tion, and popular education. But all of these things, so far 
as they mean anything, are bound up in and subordinate 
to one idea, — the idea that was so unequivocally expressed 
in the aphorisms of “Evening Hours of a Hermit,” and 
which is also the underlying conception of “Leonard and 
Gertrude.” That one supreme idea is Pestalozzi’s idea of 
the home.  
-P-A-G-E-274
  264 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
We have his own words: ‘A man’s domestic relations 
are the first and most important of his nature.... The 
home is the true basis of the education of humanity.” 
These two aphorisms, taken from his first educational 
treatise, were never contradicted, modified, or retracted by 
Pestalozzi. They represent the true explaining principle of 
all his subsequent teaching. The very titles of his writings 
furnish evidence of this: 
1. “The Instruction of Children in the Home” (an early 
unpublished writing). 
2. “ Christopher and Elisa,” in which a father and mother 
discuss chapters from “ Leonard and Gertrude ” before their 
son Fritz. 
3. “ The Good Jacob, how he teaches his Son,” an article 
in the Schweizerblatt, a journal in which was discussed every- 
thing, great or small, which was good for domestic use. 
4. “ How Gertrude teaches her Children,” an attempt to 
give mothers a guide so that they may teach their children 
themselves. 
5. “ The Natural Schoolmaster,” or a practical guide for 
the elementary instruction of children in all preliminary 
knowledge up to their sixth year. 
6. “A Book for Mothers,” or a guide for mothers, en- 
abling them to teach their children to observe and to talk. 
7. The address of Pestalozzi to the British public, solic- 
iting them to aid, by subscription, his plan of preparing 
schoolmasters and schoolmistresses for the people, that man- 
kind may in time receive the first principles of intellectual 
instruction from their mothers (1818). 
8. Pestalozzi’s very last speech, made a few months be- 
fore his death, bore this title, “The Simplest Methods 
whereby to educate a Child at Home from the Cradle to 
its Sixth Year.”
-P-A-G-E-275
  
PESTALOZZI AND HOME EDUCATION 265 
9. But, above all, should be mentioned his “My First 
Book for the People, Leonard and Gertrude,” which, if it is 
anything, is an encomium of the home. 
Gertrude is his ideal teacher. She is, he says, the woman 
who makes her house a temple of the living God, and wins 
heaven for her husband and her children. Pestalozzi is 
always ready to pay a tribute to the mothers, his own 
genius being distinctly feminine. There was in him, says 
Niederer, as much woman as man. 
“The mother,” says Pestalozzi, “is qualified by the 
Creator himself to become the principal agent in the de- 
velopment of her child.” 
The revolutionary ideas on home education which Pesta- 
lozzi cherished are still further expressed in the following 
quotations from his speeches and writings : 
“And thus the central and essential principle of educa- 
tion is not teaching, but love, which alone is an eternal 
emanation of the divinity within us.” 
“The only sure foundation upon which we must build 
for institutions for popular education, national culture, and 
the education of the poor is the parental heart, which, by 
means of the innocence, truth, power, and purity of its love, 
kindles in the child the belief in love.” (Address at his 
seventy-third birthday.) 
“The parent’s teaching is the kernel of wisdom, and the 
schoolmaster’s business is only to make a husk over it.” 
“Forget, mothers, if it is necessary, all other work, all 
other attachment, in order to penetrate into the purity and 
the sacredness of your maternal vocation.” 
“Good mothers, let it not be unjustly said any longer 
that you have not understanding and strength for what in 
your circumstances is your highest and holiest duty. If you 
once go so far as to weep in the stillness of your chambers  
-P-A-G-E-276
    266 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
because the good Gertrude did more for her children than 
you have hitherto done for yours, I am sure that you will 
then try whether it be not possible to do what she did, and 
it is when you are arrived at this point that I wish to offer 
you my elementary books.” 
“Mothers, show at last, after these centuries, the injustice 
that mankind has done you in seizing from your hands the 
first instruction of your children.” 
The last is very characteristic. The staple notion that 
Froebel continued and supplemented the work of Pestalozzi 
is somewhat misleading. Though Froebel can be quoted to 
show that he believed primarily in home education, in so 
far as the kindergarten takes the children away from their 
mothers it is the very abrogation of Pestalozzi’s ideal. 
A father visiting the Burgdorf institute made this re- 
mark, “Why, these exercises are so simple that my wife 
and I could give them at home.” “The very thing you 
ought to do,” was Pestalozzi’s quick reply. In another 
instance a visitor remarked, “ Why, this is not a school, 
but a family.” “That is the greatest praise you can give 
me,” said Pestalozzi. 
In a discourse delivered on the occasion of his seventy- 
second birthday he proposes to use the money he hopes to 
get from the republication of his works to continue experi- 
ments in pursuit of ever simpler means for elementary 
teaching in the home. Elsewhere he says: “ For a half cen- 
tury I have been seeking with unwearying activity to sim- 
plify the elementary instruction of the people. I desired 
nothing else, but merely sought to render the ordinary 
means of instruction so simple as to permit of their being 
employed in every family.” 
mined to simplify, to mechanize, to psychologize education. 
He used to say that his method of Anschauung (sense This is why he was so deter-
-P-A-G-E-277
    PESTALOZZI AND HOME EDUCATION 267 
perception) was not the end to which he devoted his life, 
but simply one of the special means by which he hoped 
to reach it. 
( From Stanz he writes, “ My aim was so to simplify the 
means of instruction that it should be quite possible for 
even the most ordinary person to teach his children himself ; 
thus schools would gradually almost cease to be necessary 
so far as the first elements are concerned.” 
Very interesting is a passage from a letter in which he 
contrasts himself with the German Rochow: “I wish to 
elevate the people without special establishments, through 
the fathers and mothers whom I seek to enlighten, and he 
wishes to influence them through the schools. Both means 
are good, but the first is the only possible one for me.” 
Yes, he goes so far as to say, “the schools can never 
become a substitute for domestic education. Only as ad- 
juncts and stop-gaps can they hope to serve the world.” 
In his utopian dreams Pestalozei undoubtedly pictured a 
society in which all primary-school education was carried 
on in the homes. 
We have dwelt at length on Pestalozzi’s idea of the home 
because we must single out that one idea and make it cen- 
tral if we are to have an adequate appreciation of Pestalozzi’s 
purpose and of his message. The home is the center toward 
which all his thoughts on education converged. Gertrude 
is the generic mother, the Wohnstube the generic home on 
which the regeneration of society depends. Be it never for- 
gotten that Pestalozzi’s aim was the regeneration of society. 
He was something more than an educationist. Strong as 
was the teaching impulse in him, the social-reform instinct 
was more fundamental. Liebes Volk, ich will dir aufhelfen! 
It was that instinct which turned him from all palliatives to 
the home. Vaterhaus, du Schule der Sitten und des Staates ! 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  268 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
Misawa has neatly stated the difference between Pestalozzi 
and Rousseau in the following words: “ Not go back to na- 
ture, but go back to the home. Not to build a new society 
on the absolutely free, independent, natural man, but on 
the work-loving, man-loving, God-loving, unsophistically 
developed social man, or rather home man.” 
Pestalozzi’s pedagogy is deeply social. He became an 
educational reformer only because he was a social reformer. 
Natorp, one of the leading exponents of social pedagogy in 
Germany, says, “It is Pestalozzi’s distinction to have put 
back the question of education on a social basis, and the 
social question back on the basis of human education.” 
Ziegler says, “ The true greatness of Pestalozzi lies in the 
social spirit of his pedagogy, in the realization of the close 
relation of the social problem with the problem of true 
human development, in the idea of rescuing fallen humanity 
from destruction through the awakening and strengthen- 
ing of its best human powers, helping it through education 
to self-help.” i 
After all, is Pestalozzi anything more than a fascinating 
historical character, a fortunate fanatic? Have time and 
change canceled his teachings, or do they possess a present 
worth? Is there any reason for the cry, Back to Pestalozzi? 
He has been compared to the great Teacher, Christ himself, 
so it will not be sacrilegious to put the question this way: 
What if Pestalozzi came to Chicago ? 
Chicago is the greatest railroad center in the world, and 
is all that this implies; Pestalozzi was two years in his 
grave before the first railroad was finished. Chicago is the 
greatest meat center in the world; Pestalozzi knew only 
shepherd’s crooks and little flocks. Chicago is a city of 
factories and tenement houses; ‘“‘ Leonard and Gertrude” 
suggests a spinning wheel and a peasant’s cottage with vines

PESTALOZZI AND HOME EDUCATION 269 
growing over the door. “Agriculture was the reigning task 
of the eighteenth century.” Two thirds of Pestalozzi’s life 
fell in that century; he had witnessed and participated in 
the agrarian French revolution; but what did he know 
of that great industrial revolution wrought by steam and 
electricity, a revolution which has had vastly more to do 
with determining the structure of present-day society and 
has added such baffling complexities to the social problem? 
Pestalozzi proposed to solve the social problem, so we are 
putting a fair question when we ask, What did he know of 
the industrial revolution ? 
‘We do not have all the data for the complete answer to 
this question, but have gathered some material from his two 
latest writings on social and industrial conditions. From 
these discussions, which were written when he was an octo- 
genarian, it appears that he did have some vague appre- 
hension of what was going on, but no clear grasp of the 
tendencies and no prophecy of what was to be. He confesses 
that things are not as they were in the good old days when 
the very rich and the very poor were few, and when sub- 
stantial economic equality reigned. Each man then had his 
trade and his plot of land and his cottage; the more in- 
dustrious he was, the more he earned. But of late Pesta- 
lozzi sees the good old domestic virtues decaying, finds less 
simplicity and more selfishness. He regrets that the intro- 
duction of industrial life should cause such inequalities in 
the distribution of wealth, should weaken the middle class 
and increase the number of the propertyless. 
But he had no conception of the great modern proletariat. 
His ideas remained rather old-fashioned, Poor-Richard-like. 
He is not very radical on questions of legislation; he up- 
holds monarchy and believes in a benevolent aristocracy. 
He thinks that most of the inequalities in wealth are  
-P-A-G-E-280
  
  270 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
inevitable. The child of the poor man must be educated to 
poverty, he says; the rich man must be taught charity and 
unselfishness. If the good housewife keeps the kitchen 
clean and takes good care of the children, if the father will 
be faithful at his trade and not frequent the tavern, if the 
pastor will not be too theoretical, and the magistrate honest 
and kind, all will be well. Material improvements, while im- 
portant, are not primary; human nature must be inwardly 
elevated. “So much I early saw, that the surroundings 
make the man; but just as early, that the man makes the 
surroundings.” And so to the end he retained his sublime 
faith in education. He did not realize the desperate power 
and the relentless tendencies of the changing industrial 
environment. He sees in the new commercial spirit — the 
evil Zeitgeist, as he calls it —only a passing thing which 
will disappear when Switzerland goes back to the good old 
domesticity of the good old days. 
With his limited knowledge and experience it was almost 
impossible that Pestalozzi should understand the industrial 
revolution, even though the English manufacturer, Robert 
Owen, on his visit to Yverdon, may have told him some- 
thing of the state of affairs in England, where the revo- 
lution was writing out its meaning in tragic characters. 
Ten years before Pestalozzi died, mobs of starving English 
workmen had smashed, in riot, the newly invented power 
machines, and paraded through the streets with a banner 
that displayed this inscription: 
PRE t STATE or GREAT BRITAIN 
  Four million people on the point of starvation 
Four million with a bare subsistence 
One and a half million in straitened circumstances

Evidently the Pestalozzian problem of poverty was not 
local to Switzerland. Do not forget that as early as 1798 
Joseph Lancaster, the English Quaker, had opened a free 
school for the instruction of poor children, and that Robert 
Owen, who had a spirit of philanthropy no less admirable 
than that of Pestalozzi himself, had already established 
the first infant school in England. Robert Owen, the mil- 
lionaire manufacturer, “the father of English socialism,” 
was a direct product of the industrial revolution, and he 
realized it. “Perish the cotton trade!” he exclaimed, “per- 
ish the political superiority of our country, rather than that 
they shall be upheld by the sacrifice of everything yalu- 
able in life!” He too concerned himself with the problem 
of poverty, but regeneration by education was not the sole 
factor in his remedy. His ideal included a reconstruction 
of the environment. Just as Pestalozzi, the social reformer, 
was turning eighty, Robert Owen, the socialist, appeared 
before the United States Senate and stirred the life of the 
nation by his appeal for governmental support to his grand 
communist scheme, his prairie farm of thirty thousand acres 
which he was about to organize in New Harmony, Indiana. 
One year before Pestalozzi died, our Albert Gallatin said, 
“The New Harmony system of education is the best in the 
world.” It claimed to be based on Pestalozzian principles. 
Robert Owen was its founder; William McClure, who had 
met Pestalozzi in Paris, was one of its teachers; the other 
teacher was Joseph Neef, of Switzerland, the author of the 
first American book on pedagogy, and the former colleague 
of Pestalozzi. 
New Harmony, Indiana, is not very far from Chicago, 
so, after all, we have got back to our starting point. 
Has the present industrial age, typified in Chicago, put a 
veto on Pestalozzi’s fundamental conceptions about home
-P-A-G-E-282
es ee eee 
272 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
education? Could he solve the social problem without 
knowing the social problem? Ziegler says, “A social peda- 
gogy! Pestalozzi created such at a time when there was 
not even a social problem, or, better, when this had not 
risen above the threshold of the consciousness of mankind. 
We are only now beginning to understand the boldness of 
his pedagogical creation.” Ziegler implies that the program 
in “Leonard and Gertrude” can be applied to Chicago. 
Whether we agree with him or not, the Pestalozzian prob- 
lem of poverty still exists. The poor are yet with us. We 
have ten million of them in our country this very day. 
Back to Pestalozzi? Whether or not we go back to all the 
principles of Pestalozzi, one thing is certain: if the edu- 
cators of to-day are, like him, to have a real share in the 
solution of the social problem, they must be actuated by his 
spirit of social conservation, and believe that “there is no 
greater crime against God, man, and fatherland, than to 
stifle the seeds of good in the poor.”

  CHAPTER XXIII 
A HEALTHY BODY 
Common sense and Herbert Spencer both say that the first 
requisite is to be a good animal. This is, if anything, more 
true of the child than of the adult, for in childhood the 
animal body, which is destined to be the physiological house 
and instrument of the adult mind, is growing, and the growth 
should be sound, lusty, full. In childhood, health has a 
double value; it furthers the fulfillment of child life and 
promises a complete maturity. In still another sense does 
health always have a double value. Our lives are in the flesh, 
our spirits embodied, and therefore health beautifies and 
perfects not only the body but also the soul. The hygiene 
of to-day must recognize as together what God has united. 
Health and education are almost identical conceptions. 
Society and the school cannot do their full duty until they 
take into account the whole child, body as well as mind, 
and that in a spirit of hygienic solicitude. The following 
survey is necessarily very limited, but it aims to be concrete 
enough to give to the primary-school teacher an eye and a 
feeling for the most palpable phases of physical health. 
The teeth. One of the most important events in the physi- 
cal development of the little first-grader is the eruption of 
the sixth-year molar. So far from being a conspicuous, dra- 
matic event, it usually excites no notice. We look into the 
mouths of horses, but how many parents and teachers ever 
concern themselves about the child’s first permanent molar ? 
Tt does not take a specialist to know the simple, fundamental 
273

274 THE CQNSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
facts about the hygiene of the teeth, and yet ignorance is 
the main excuse for our neglect. In fact, the sixth-year 
molar, appearing before the milk teeth are shed, is often 
ignorantly extracted as a useless temporary tooth. 
And it is the most important tooth in the head! If 
every tooth is a diamond, as an oriental proverb holds,      
    
     
    
       
    
   
        
    
   
  then this one is the most precious of all. For a half 
dozen reasons it 
should be most 
carefully pro- 
tected: first, it 
is the first per- 
manent tooth to 
appear (its biting 
surface, or cusp, 
being formed at 
birth); second, 
it is the largest, 
strongest tooth, 
and the one most 
essential to mas- 
tication ; third, it

is the keystone 
of the dental arch; fifth, its location determines the align- 
ment and occlusion of the succeeding teeth; sixth, its 
misposition may even affect the shape of the jaw. 
Every teacher should therefore be able to locate the 
sixth-year molar in any child’s mouth. This is simple. One 
has but to count from the middle, beginning with a central] 
incisor; the sixth tooth in order should be the sixth-year} 
molar. The accompanying figure makes this clearer. It  
-P-A-G-E-285
  
A HEALTHY BODY 275 
shows the condition and position of the teeth at the age 
of five and a half. The child has lost the two first incisor 
teeth and is receiving the incisor teeth of the second set; 
also, the sixth-year molar, which is the first permanent 
tooth, is being received back of all the first teeth, and 
it is very nearly in position. At this time the crowns of 
the cuspid and bicuspid teeth of the second set are being 
formed, and absorption is starting in the roots of the first 
teeth. The crown of the twelfth-year molar, which is the 
second molar of the second set, is here shown starting to 
form. The figure pictures how the jaw enlarges to receive 
these teeth. 
Another proverb might be cited to justify the insistence 
on the value of a little detail like the sixth-year molar: 
“For want of a nail the shoe was lost; for want of,” etc. 
Better still, we can quote an actual case of moral delin- 
quency, described by Dr. A. H. Holmes, directly traceable 
to a misplaced sixth-year molar. 
The boy in question went from bad to worse, and finally 
reached the juvenile court. Fortunately he was sent to a 
dental clinic, where the following diagnosis was reported: 
“On the lower right side the space between the first per- 
manent molar and first premolar has been partially closed 
by the pushing forward of the first permanent (sixth-year) 
molar. This condition has led to a partial impaction of the 
second premolar, which is as yet unerupted and which may 
be a source of peripheral irritation. On the whole, the case 
is, from my point of view, a typical one of what I call 
dentitional stress, that is to say, of nervous irritation, which 
frequently arises during the period of exchange of the per- 
manent for the deciduous teeth.” 
The nervous irritation in this instance profoundly dis- | 
turbed the very morality of the boy, and on its removal

Se ee eee 
276 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
“his whole nervous system seemed to express itself in one 
sigh of relief.” The transformation of the boy’s behavior 
was almost instantaneous. 
While such acute cases may be somewhat exceptional, 
defective teeth are almost universal. Statistics show that 
from 80 per cent to 100 per cent of school children have 
diseased teeth, and the proportion is greatest in the primary 
grades. One investigator found that “of three thousand 
Americans over twenty-five years of age only seven had all 
four sixth-year molars in the mouth.” 
Dr. George Cunningham, director of the free dental in- 
stitute (without forceps) for school children at Cambridge, 
England, found that only 2 per cent of the children in 
vestigated had sound teeth. In round numbers one thou- 
sand out of three thousand children “had free pus in their 
mouths, some of which would be swallowed every time 
food was taken, while other portions of it, thrown out in 
speaking or singing, would go towards polluting the school 
atmosphere and lowering the vitality of both children and 
teachers.” The unclean mouths of children are therefore 
responsible for some of the odor and the very pollution of 
schoolroom air. 
  Some day, when preventive

appalled by the conditions w!

hich now prevail. Though a 
included in medical inspec- 
children’s dentists are almost 
ill consumed with the lucra- 
tive repairing of adult mouths and the annual installation 
of millions of manufactured teeth. 
The orthodontists are some   hing of an exception. They 
take advantage of the fact that the jaws grow and form 
about the roots of the teeth, a nd that the teeth determine
-P-A-G-E-287
  A HEALTHY BODY 277 
the size and shape of the jaw. They are doing an admi- 
rable work in aiding plastic nature to produce more shapely 
jaws. Teachers should know what marvels can be wrought 
by orthodontia for children with protruding, spaced, or 
irregular teeth, and with underdeveloped or misshapen 
jaws and chins. 
But infinitely more essential than orthodontia, bridge 
work, or any other clever repair is simple, religious clean- 
liness. The importance of consistently caring for the tem- 
porary teeth from the time they are cut until they are 
outgrown is not yet appreciated. These are the reasons 
why they should be protected with great care: to insure 
good, comfortable mastication ; to establish early the clean- 
mouth habit ; to prevent pain, nervous irritability, and ear 
troubles, that go with decay; to avoid a poisonous bac- 
terial condition of the mouth; to insure the healthy, regu- 
lar eruption and development of the permanent teeth, and 
especially the first molars. Simply because the child’s first 
teeth are to be outgrown, they cannot be neglected with 
impunity. As Dr. Burnham has said, “It is a concrete 
case in the child’s anatomy where normal immaturity is a 
condition of normal maturity.” 
Some day society will realize that the well-developed 
child is the most valuable possession of the race, and in 
the light of that realization may provide for the periodical, 
thorough cleansing, by mechanical appliance, of the teeth 
of school children. School nurses could easily be trained 
to perform this important prophylactic service. 
Some one has summed it up in this way: “ Without good 
teeth there can be no thorough mastication ; without thor- 
ough mastication there cannot be perfect digestion ; without 
perfect digestion there cannot be nutrition ; without nutri- 
tion there cannot be health; without health, what is life ?” 
   
-P-A-G-E-288
    278 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
The nose. Though not always ornamental, the nose is 
very important for physical health, for the good reason that 
the nostrils are lined with a delicate mucous membrane 
which filters, warms, and moistens the air which passes over 
it. Anything which interferes with this function of the 
nose as a “practical hygienist” must be fatal to health 
and growth. 
       
     
   
         
   
                                 This is why adenoids are so serious; and at least 5 per 
cent of our school children suffer from adenoids, which 
- may be removed by a simple operation. The best time for 
such operation is, in most cases, before the age of six, which 
means that primary-school teachers may have an opportu- 
nity to do an invaluable service in detecting this defect 
and urging its timely removal. 
Just behind the rear openings of the nostrils, and between 
and above the Eustachian tubes, lies the pharyngeal tonsil. 
Normally this tonsil is at least harmless, and naturally is 
absorbed by about the sixteenth year, but in about one 
child out of twenty it becomes overgrown, usually before 
the age of six, and, because of its strategic position, does 
extremely serious mischief. In the first place, it blocks the 
natural passage of air; this is equivalent to putting a 
damper on the furnace of life. Mouth breathing and, at 
night, labored snoring result. The child’s vigor is sapped, 
and physical growth is retarded. The Eustachian tubes may 
become clogged, infected, and inflamed, producing earache 
or partial deafness. The habitual open mouth and the dis- 
use of the nostrils favor the buckling of the roof palate 
into a high vault. Thus the upper dental arch becomes 
too narrow for the teeth, which are crowded; the upper 
lip is sympathetically shortened; the nose loses its chiseled 
character and may broaden at the bridge. But parents and| 
teachers are often strangely blind even to these pronounce’
-P-A-G-E-289
  A HEALTHY BODY 279 
physiognomic symptoms. Other frequent physical effects are 
diminished stature, decreased circulation, defective speech, 
flat and feeble chest (with increased liability to tuberculo- 
sis), and stoop shoulders. There are also characteristic men- 
tal symptoms affecting memory, attention, and disposition, 
which will be referred to later. 
The following sentences by Dr. Burnham summarize the 
main practical points: “ Upon a conservative estimate there 
are in the kindergarten and elementary grades in this coun- 
try from one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand 
children suffering from adenoids. Immediate detection and 
treatment by a competent expert are likely to mean the pre- 
vention of much discomfort, increased efficiency in school 
work, and the opportunity for normal development. . . . 
Here is a case where no devices of formal education can 
atone for hygienic neglect.” 
The ears. About the ears there is less to be said. Ear- 
strain, however, may be as injurious to health as eyestrain, 
and defective hearing even more prejudicial to the-pupil’s 
mentality, his speech, and his conduct. Although a simple 
test with the watch or with whispering is sufficient to dis- 
cover most cases of deficient hearing, they often go unno- 
ticed, and sometimes with great injustice to the child. It is 
estimated that from 5 per cent to 25 per cent of pupils in 
different schools are below normal in hearing. 
The fact that impaired hearing often accompanies ade- 
noids is significant. The great majority of cases arise from 
a catarrhal condition of the middle ear. Sometimes the 
trouble is simple lack of cleanliness, and may be remedied 
by the use of soap and water, warm oil, or a solution of soda. 
Chronic discharge of the ear is a serious affair, and 
should stir parents and teachers to seek medical advice. 
The source of the discharge may be scarlet fever or 
 
-P-A-G-E-290
  280 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
measles, or a catarrhal or obstructed condition of the nose 
and throat (adenoids and enlarged tonsils). Usually the 
infection spreads along the Eustachian tube (the channel 
between the ear and the pharynx) to the middle ear, produc- 
ing inflammation and an abscess, the pus bursting through 
the eardrum. In fatal cases the infection spreads by way of 
the mastoid bone to the brain and its coverings. Apparent 
stupidity, inattention, and disobedience may result from 
partial deafness. Discharge of the ear is serious. 
The eyes. If the primary-school curriculum is very book- 
ish and wordy, the visual mechanism comes in for a 
severe and unnatural strain, and the eye may not attain 
its full size and strength. “The eye was developed for 
general-purpose vision,” says Dr. Terman, in an article on 
“Education against Nature.” “It is only in the last few 
centuries, since printing and literary instruction have be- ” 
  come universal, that the eye has been generally robbed of 
its freedom, — domesticated, so to speak,— and. harnessed 
into the wearying treadmill of the educational machine.” 
The teacher must be on the lookout for both hereditary 
and acquired defects of vision, which are the result of these 
civilization conditions. If she were among primitive peoples, 
she would not have to be so alert. 
The chief varieties of eye defect are myopia (near sight) 
and hyperopia (far sight), causing respectively a focusing 
of the image behind and in front of the retina; strabismus 
(squint), due to a deviation of the eyeballs; and astigma- 
tism, due to imperfections of the cornea, or lens, causing a 
blurred image. 
The list of symptoms associated with eye troubles is 
rather long, and includes inflammation, watering, congested 
lids, crusts, twitching, dizziness, blinking, scowling, fre- 
quent headaches (especially in the frontal regions), lack
-P-A-G-E-291
     A HEALTHY BODY 281 
of application, cocking the head or holding a book close to 
the face, blurring print, and, according to Gould, many 
cases of lateral spinal curvature. To this list might be 
added a considerable number of “reflex neuroses,” like 
vertigo, insomnia, indigestion with palpitation of the heart, 
nausea and even convulsions and nervousness, bordering on 
melancholia and hysteria. 
Dr. E. J. Swift has shown, in an excellent discussion in 
his book “ Mind in the Making,” that one of the most 
frequent sources of such neuroses is the eyes. He adds, 
“Teachers should know the part that reflex neuroses play 
in mental hygiene, and in their preparatory training they 
should learn to recognize the indications of these affections 
in order that the nervous irritation may be relieved before 
it becomes a serious menace to brain growth and mental 
development.” 
Posture. Malposture means cramped lungs, heart, and 
intestines, and sometimes even a sympathetic loss of sym- 
metry in the two halves of the face. The abdominal muscles 
relax, and that means a weakened support for the viscera. 
The spinal muscles weaken, and that means a diminished 
circulation in these muscles and in the spinal cord, where 
are located nerve centers vital to the organs and, indirectly, 
to the whole bodily and mental tone. 
It would be wrong to regard malposture as a specific, 
intrinsic defect. It is often a symptom. Developed abdom- 
inal muscles, exercise, and rest invite correct posture, and 
malposture may be but the betrayal of their absence. 
Nothing is quite so fundamental as posture; the erect 
posture is the distinction of the human being and should 
be proudly maintained. Says Dr. J. E. Goldthwait, “ There 
can be no greater service to mankind at the present time 
than to make it possible for our children, as they develop,
-P-A-G-E-292
ee eT ee eee ed Pee ee ee 
282 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
to use their bodies in such a way that there will be a mini- 
mum of waste and the greatest amount of reserve energy 
available for whatever use, whether physical, mental, or 
spiritual, to which the individual may be subjected later 
on in life.” 
Correct postural habits favor such conservation and econ- 
omy of energy. Physical poise is the foundation of mental

poise. In fact, every physical disorder is bound directly or 
indirectly to affect the nervous system, which is so intimately 
in touch with every bodily structure and function. 
The brain neurons. In Chapter IV we dealt with the 
significance of the neuron. Considered from the broadest

than the nerve cells.) They are the.master cells which con-

Considered from the narrower standpoint of education and
-P-A-G-E-293
  A HEALTHY BODY 283 
personal hygiene, no cells are more important than the 
neurons. Their health directly affects the mind as well as 
the body, the morals as well as the physique. Luther Bur- 
bank, whose studies of the vegetable kingdom have given 
him deep insight into the needs of the human plant, tells us 
to “regard as the most priceless possession of the growing 
child his nervous system.” 
Whatever metaphysics may say about the ultimate connec- 
tion of the psychical and the physical, this much is certain : 
the neurons are the organs and instrument of our conscious 
and subconscious life, but, notwithstanding their exalted 
function, they are mortal bits of protoplasm, dependent on 
a blood stream. 
To make this broad and far-reaching truth concrete, the 
reader should memorize the picture on page 284, and 
these few facts: “ The brain requires and has an enormous 
blood supply.” “The capillaries of the brain are not only 
more numerous, but they are smaller in size and their walls 
are thinner than those of any other tissue.” ‘‘ The demand 
for blood in abundance is more urgent than elsewhere.” 
“Improper blood will alter mind; imperfect drainage will 
confuse mind.” (Clouston.) 
In a word, healthiness of mind depends first of all upon 
the condition of the neurons. This is why nutrition and 
rest are educational problems as real as spelling and read- 
ing. It cannot be otherwise; but, like other self-evident 
truths, this one is not yet the practice of the race. 
Adenoids dull the mind because they injure the brain 
neurons. The vacant, stupid expression of the adenoid face 
is not due to the anatomical effect on the nose and mouth 
so much as to the debilitating functional effect on the brain 
neurons. The lymph spaces of the nose communicate with 
those of the brain, and when these are clogged, and when,

in addition, the respiration is interfered with, the nutrition 
of the brain must suffer. 
Since the cortical neurons are affected, the characteristic 
symptoms are distractible attention (aprosexia nasalis), 
disturbed emotion, and weak memory. In one instance a

  primary-school child had spent a whole year in school 
without learning the alphabet. An operation removed the 
adenoids, and the alphabet was learned in a week. 
In another instance a child was irritable by day, restless ” by night, whining, captious, and “ spoiled.” Adenoids, not 
indulgence, spoiled her, for when they were removed, her
-P-A-G-E-295
A HEALTHY BODY 285 
disposition was marvelously transformed. The brain neu- 
rons are the seat of the emotions, mood, and character as 
well as of memory. Healthy emotional reactions depend 
upon healthy neurons. 
Food and air. In some large cities, like Liverpool, Lon 
don, and Naples, the school authorities have been almost 
forced to feed the school children. These school meals have 
had a marked effect upon mentality and conduct, for the 
respectable materialistic reason that a school lunch enriches 
the blood stream which nourishes the hundreds of millions 
of brain neurons in each child. But one need not go to the 
slums to discover the transforming effect of a timely glass of 
milk and a graham cracker on the attention and deportment 
of a primary-school pupil. Even if you have well-to-do 
children, the experiment may sometime be worth trying. 
In prosperous suburban districts you may hear the com- 
plaint that the children buy lunches of pastry and pickles. 
The teacher who insisted that her pupils should devote 
at least twenty minutes to eating lunch quietly realized 
that the development of the child was not confined to the 
recitation periods. 
Air is as fundamentally important as food. No one will 
ever know what a tragic toll the ill ventilation of the 
average school has taken and is taking from the lives of 
millions of children. The overdry, overheated schoolroom 
atmosphere parches the mucous membranes of the whole 
respiratory system, and thus lessens their resistance to dis- 
ease germs. Worse still, this air is in a state of stagnation, 
allowing the body of each child to “ surround itself with a 
steam jacket,” when “the entire body requires ventilation, 
299     
evaporation, ‘ unwarming. 
The net result of this prevailing condition is an elabo- 
rate range of symptoms, from inattention and irritability to
-P-A-G-E-296
  286 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
dizziness and fainting, and always an insidious attack on 
the child’s vitality. Good authorities hold that a majority 
of the cases of adult tuberculosis are due to infection in 
childhood. 
The only solution is to surround all children with the 
“flowing, outdoor, atmospheric air.” Large cities are now 
experimenting with open-air schools of different degrees 
and varieties. The architecture and devices are simple, — 
tents, lean-tos, roof pavilions, sheltered porches, windbreaks, 
windows hung from ceilings, foot boxes, sitting-out bags, 
sleeping bags, etc. 
Quite recently a roof school, conducted by the Chicago 
Tuberculosis Institute, “ gathered in a group of limp, pal- 
lid, physically blighted children. They were listless, inatten- 
tive, uninterested, and uninteresting. A thirty days’ régime 
of intelligent care and feeding, of exercise and rest, resulted 
in an average gain of seven pounds, and, in the opinion of 
the teachers, made the pupils an average group of children 
in alertness, and in ability to sit up and take instruction and 
keep up sustained interest in their work. ... This was prob- 
ably the one school in the city of Chicago where the boys 
and girls refused to take a vacation.” The Eskimo suit 
makes the open-air school practical even in winter weather. 
In another Chicago school the fresh-air experiment was 
tried on ‘ 
change for the better. It did away with the necessity of “normal” children. Here, too, there was a great 
much reviewing (and how much of the time in the ill- 
ventilated primary school is spent in drill work!). It made 
one impression count, and the children became “ strong, 
intelligent, active, cheerful, capable, and free from head- 
aches and dullness.” 
Rest. The study of fatigue has grown almost to the 
dimensions of a special science. We can allude only to a
-P-A-G-E-297
     
A HEALTHY BODY 287 
few facts which relate to our central consid, vation, the 
neurons. All exertion affects the neurons lee eee 
indirectly, through the diffusion of waste products in the 
blood; and directly, by a consumption of the nutritive 
granules in the cell bodies of these neurons. Sleep is the 
sweet restorer of the granules. 
Painstaking chemical and microscopic investigations 
reveal these fatigue conditions, but unfortunately there is 
no handy X-ray device whereby the teacher can detect 
them. She must educate herself to look for all sorts of 
secondary symptoms, subtle and pronounced; heavy upper 
eyelid, irritability, inattention, obstinacy, restlessness, loose 
posture, twitching, incodrdination in speech, ete. 
There is another symptom of fatigue which only the ex- 
pert diagnostician can discover. This is diminution in the 
number of red corpuscles. In one interesting count in a 
group of school boys and girls in Germany the average 
number of corpuscles per cubic millimeter of blood was 
increased by almost one million after a two months’ vaca- 
tion in the country. 
Nature’s inexorable rhythms cannot be opposed without 
penalty. The curve of activity in the amceba is a series 
of waves showing regular alternation of exertion and rest. 
Rest is as necessary as food, because physically it is the 
condition of chemical replenishment and growth. Rest is as 
necessary as attention, because psychically it is the condition 
of mental assimilation and growth. Mental assimilation is 
a subconscious process on a par with organic anabolism. 
Rest, nutrition, ventilation, —these factors are first in 
the development of the child. The day may come when 
every child will be treated as incipiently tuberculous, and 
when he will be freely furnished with proper food and air, 
sunshine and sleep. What a sad joke it would be if, with  
-P-A-G-E-298
  
288 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
this belated justice, half of the problems of pedagogy should 
suddenly evaporate ! 
In this day and age health and education are no longer 
separable. The teacher may argue that it is her business 
to teach, and say, “Let medical inspection and health boards 
do the rest.” But the medical inspector is at best an infre- 
quent and hurried visitor, and he always needs the intelli- 
gent codperation of the teacher. When there is no medical 
inspection, her vigilance over the child’s physical develop- 
ment is still more imperative. 
The wide-awake, responsible teacher simply must assume 
the “physician’s attitude” toward the child, and do what 
she can “to adjust school activities to his health and growth 
needs.” She must become a diagnostician, even if an ama- 
teur one, and learn the elementary signs of retarded or 
defective physical development.
-P-A-G-E-299
CHAPTER XXIV 
A HEALTHY MIND 
The fundamental facts of mental hygiene are inseparable 
from those of physical hygiene. We have shown that the 
brute health, the vigor of the mind, depends first of all 
upon such physical considerations as eyes, ears, nose, and 
blood, food, air, and rest. The nicer and higher details 
of mental hygiene are inseparable from pedagogy, or from 
education in a particular sense. Given a sound body, a 
healthy mind is possible ; but the inner organization of that 
mind into desirable, well-proportioned sentiments, habits, 
and attitudes depends after all upon the pedagogical values 
of the home and the school. 
This fact, though rather abstractly stated, has very im- 
portant bearings on all matters of school practice. It means 
that pedagogical methods should not be tested by their suc- 
cess in imparting prescribed subject matter, but by their 
effect on the health of the mind. In a word, it means that 
education should be conducted from the standpoint of psy- 
choprophylaxis. There is no question which more directly 
touches to the quick the value of any school exercise or 
school program than this one: Does it promote a healthy 
mind and healthy-mindedness ? 
We have tried to represent this point of view throughout 
the discussions in Part Three, insisting all along that the 
good method is not a device which most promptly imparts 
a bit of memory material, but is the method which preserves 
the right mental atmosphere, builds up the right prejudice, 
289 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
290 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
the right attitude, and encourages healthy personal reactions 
in the child. 
The mind is a unitary living organism which, though it 
is bound up with a physical organism, has a distinctive 
hygiene. As the physiologist has distinguished the various 
bodily functions of assimilation, excretion, etc., so the psy- 
chologist has discriminated the functions of the mind. 
They have been happily characterized by Royce as the un- 
learned reactions, docility and initiative. The first func- 
tion comprises all the instincts and native tendencies; 
the second, all the culture traits, habits of perception and 
action, the acquired tendencies of behavior. By “initiative” 
is meant the original, free, creative aspect of mind. It, 
more than anything else, stands for what is distinctive in 
the individual, for his genius. 
Now children, as well as adults, have these three phases 
of mind, and it may be said that mental health depends 
upon the preservation of all these phases in their full power 
and harmonious proportion. This statement sounds rather 
theoretical, but it has a thousand concrete applications in 
school management. 
If heredity were all, then mental hygiene would not be 
so necessary. The mind qualities and tendencies would, 
from an inborn power, come to maturity. Heredity places 
certain marks and limitations on mentality, but it does not 
absolutely insure the development of its possibilities. A 
child may be a natural-born imbecile—you cannot make 
him normal; but if neglected or unwisely treated, he is 
quite likely to sink to the plane of an idiot. Undoubtedly, 
normal children are often made pseudo-feeble-minded by 
unwise school methods. 
One of the chief symptoms of feebleness of mind is a lack 
of the qualities of initiative, independence, resourcefulness ;
-P-A-G-E-301
A HEALTHY MIND 291 
and these are the very qualities which the schools do the 
least to preserve. It is absolutely certain that poor teach- 
ing can bring about a cerebral enfeeblement which will 
destroy some of the finest elements of child life, — eager- 
ness, spontaneity, originality, curiosity, —the qualities of 
initiative. In the chapter on instinct we showed the hygienic 
significance of relaxation. The highest function of relaxa- 
tion is to nourish the natural sources of these supreme qual- 
ities of personality. The conservation of these same qualities 
should be the highest aim of educational hygiene. More of 
this in the concluding chapters. The relationship of the 
sense of humor to a healthy mind is so important that we 
have devoted a special chapter to that subject. 
The mind is a living unit, but a unit with three expres- 
sions: thinking, feeling, and doing, — intellect, emotion, 
and will. Hygiene recognizes the natural unity of the 
mind, and insists that mental health depends on a proper 
coérdination of all three expressions. Pedagogy also must 
recognize this natural unity and beware of any practice 
which artificially dissociates thinking or doing from feeling. 
It surely is true in the adult that unhappiness, not to 
say mental abnormality (subjectivity, melancholia, etc.), 
results if emotion is ineffectual or if there is a great gap 
between thought and action. The mind must be firmly 
knit together to be healthy. 
The mental hygiene of the child at the primary-school 
age is doubly important because it affects health of mind 
in youth and in maturity. Childhood is, from the stand- 
point of hygiene, the foundation of youth. 
Dementia precox is a pathetic youthful failure of mind, 
an adolescent mental deterioration which supplies almost 
one third of all the admissions to hospitals for the insane. 
The central feature of this dementia is a dissociation of 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  292 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
thought, action, and feeling. The subject often sinks into 
a state of stuporous inactivity, with empty ambitions and 
reduced emotions. It is coming to be believed that this 
peculiar mental dilapidation and irresponsiveness is not 
necessarily due to organic, morbid heredity, but may be 
the lawful outcome of previous faulty adjustments to envi- 
ronment, of poor education, and serious lack of “concrete 
productivity.” By fostering hearty attack of tangible prob- 
lems, absorption in concrete interests, and healthy habits 
of work, the primary school may perform a preventive office 
in diminishing the liability to dementia preecox and milder 
approaches to that condition. The school must not be need- 
lessly guilty of dissociating thought, feeling, and action. 
The mistake of many school methods is that they do 
not treat the child as a unit. They seem to regard him 
from a phrenological standpoint, as though his brain were 
a bundle of independent organs, one for writing, another 
for number, etc. Nature intended the child to work as a 
unit. Intellect, feeling, and will should function together, 
reénforcing one another. 
In this trinity, feeling is both central and fundamental. 
Feeling, mood, emotion, desire, attitudes (they are all kin), 
are born of instinct, and there is nothing more fundamental 
in human nature than instinct. 
Nature desires children to work by mood and motive. This, 
we think, is the supreme principle of mental hygiene ap- 
plicable to the problems of child life and primary-school 
education. It is unnecessary to add that by mood we do 
not mean a passing whim, but a feeling atmosphere which 
initiates, supports, and energizes what the child is doing. 
For the hygiene of instruction this principle is very far- 
reaching. The following will recall the application of the 
principle to the program and pedagogy of the primary school:
-P-A-G-E-303
A HEALTHY MIND 293 
Drawing needs the artistic mood, the desire to express. 
So does the dramatic work. Both should be a “natural 
reaction to feeling.” 
They are like language. Language cannot be taught; 
it must be evoked. It must spring from a wish to say 
something. 
Phonics instruction must recognize the factor of feel- 
ing, the spirit of play. It is bound to fail if it is formal, 
technical, listless. Melodious speech depends primarily 
on mood. 
Reading should have a motive. It should be accompanied 
by the feeling of creativity, of investigation, —the desire 
for information. 
Literature, above all else, must be pervaded by and 
awaken fitting moods. 
Even nature study must not be solely informational. 
More important than mere facts are the feelings for the 
facts, the attitudes toward nature, life, sex, ete. 
Handwriting, which is the most purely technical subject 
in the whole curriculum, suffers if feeling is absent. It 
prospers best with the support of the rhythmic mood. 
The morning exercises, however brief, may become the 
most precious part of the day, because they are psycho- 
logical moments for setting moods and awakening varied 
emotional attitudes of joy, seriousness, and humor. 
Busy-work is a foe to child life if it invites disintegrating 
languor. It should nourish the spirit of achievement and 
pride in efficient effort. 
Discipline reduces itself to the maintenance of the right 
working attitudes in the classroom. 
Finally, in handwork the chief consideration again is 
attitude, — attitude toward work. Here intelligence, feel- 
ing, and will must join to bring about joyous, purposeful
-P-A-G-E-304
  294 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
activity. Love of independent effort, joy of attack, enthusi- 
astic persistence in work, — these are the vital things to 
preserve. The reason why handwork, all in all, furnishes 
the best medium for the education of the primary-school 
child is because, more than any other subject, it enlists this 
whole personality energized by mood and motive. 
Primary-school children, even more than older children, 
need to preserve the integrity of personality. They are more 
generic, less differentiated, less open to specialization ; and 
premature specialization, which invites only part of their 
energy, injures the health of their growing minds. They 
throw their whole being into play. Nothing so unifies their 
whole nature as the spirit of play, and the work of the 
school ought to enjoy the same unifying mood and motive. 
Short periods of intense, whole-souled activity followed by 
relaxation, — this is the ideal of primary-school education. 
~The time is sure to come when the school will more 
frankly and fully carry out this ideal by interspersing the 
school session with periods of complete relaxation. Chronic 
busyness is the bane of school life, even though the etymo- 
logical meaning of the word “school” is “leisure.” Steamer 
chairs and reclining cots have a place in the development 
of normal as well as of sickly school children. The valu- 
able art of taking a cat nap or a recuperative “ let-down” 
might well be taught in the kindergarten and primary 
grades; that is, if we really believe that one of the aims 
of education is the development of healthful habits of 
relaxation. 
When we attempt to describe the qualities of a healthy 
mind, we naturally use those adjectives which also apply to 
the healthy body, such as “ strong,” “ vigorous,” “ prompt,” 
“balance,” “ effectual,” “organized,” and “athletic.” An 
athletic body is one which will take hurdles nicely, which
-P-A-G-E-305
A HEALTHY MIND 295 
will expend just the right energy in taking them. So also 
is the athletic mind. 
These athletic qualities have their beginning in the 
primary school, and are nurtured in the daily habits of 
study, the habits of play and work. Habits of dawdling 
activity and moodless lassitude make the mind which is’ as 
inert and inconsequent as an atrophied muscle. Surely this 
is not the healthy mind; it is the enfeebled mind, for which 
education, rather than morbid heredity, is responsible. The 
healthy mind is the mind which, though organized by whole- 
some habits, keeps on growing in the power to achieve and 
to enjoy. 
The whole child comes to school. Health alone can 
keep him whole in body and in mind. To guard this life- 
enriching health, the teacher’s love must be pervaded with 
the physician’s attitude, for surely she is called to be a 
physician to the growing mind.
-P-A-G-E-306
    CHAPTER XXV 
THE SAVING SENSE OF HUMOR 
The whole country is alive to our industrial waste, and 
necessity has made conservation a national ideal. Water, 
wood, oil, and coal must be used advisedly, that future 
generations may not pay the penalty of our improvidence. 
It is realized that these forces are motive power, that they 
hold the initial energy which drives the great industries of 
the world. Their use or misuse is a matter of public concern. 
A machine that uses energy out of proportion to the power 
it generates rusts on the market. 
But what of human energy, particularly that of the child ? 
The schools are great machines that are eating up the energy 
of childhood and keeping no record of the waste. 
The conservation of life is an ancient and noble ideal. 
We all desire that our lives should be fulfilled, not thwarted, 
that they should be abundant, not scanty. And this should 
be the ideal of the teacher and of the state in their relation 
to the lives embodied in eager, joyous children. 
But this is just the ideal most difficult to carry out. On 
every hand are “the masters of life” — convention, tra- 
dition, economy, habit — conspiring to imprison the living 
energies of teacher and pupil within rigid confines. What 
can we do to stave off these foes of the best, the variant, 
the distinctive elements in the individual life? Cultivate 
the sense of humor. 
It is the function of humor, as Kline has so well said, 
“to increase the pliancy of mental structure, to check 
296
-P-A-G-E-307
  
THE SAVING SENSE OF HUMOR 297 
mechanization, and to preserve and fan sparks of genius.” 
“Humor keeps the individual young, projects the best in 
youth into adult life, sets metes and bounds to docility, 
and prevents the mental life of the race from hardening 
Dr. Stephen Colvin 
in a recent article has called timely attention to the neg- ” into instinctive and hereditary forces. 
lected educational value of humor. ‘ To educate in humor,” 
he thinks, “is to furnish a liberal training, to humanize. 
Training in humor would do much to equip the individual 
with mind to meet the caprices of fortune with fortitude, 
intelligence, humanity, and, if need be, with resignation.” 
Gorki, in one of his great novels, says: “God makes things 
round, such as the earth and all the stars and everything 
visible to the eye. The sharp angular things are the work 
of men.” The average schoolroom is a fine example of this 
man-made angularity. The very building of which the 
room is a part is often excessively rectangular. The seating 
arrangement is uniformly rectangular, and squarely screwed 
to the floor so that it cannot ever be altered. The checker- 
board program on the board and the stiff clock stuck on 
the wall complete the picture. In satire the schoolmaster 
himself is an angular personage. 
A recent anonymous writer in Scribner’s has sketched a 
type portrait of the pedagogue, which brings out strikingly 
some of his formalistic failings’ The portrait, though not 
flattering, is drawn without malice, in a spirit of psycho- 
logical analysis, and “dedicated to the belief that it is now 
and then well to see ourselves as others see us.” “ When 
. the psychology of occupations is written,” says the writer, 
“its most interesting chapter will be one which analyzes 
the backstrokes of the various pursuits upon the workers.” 
The occupational backstrokes which stamp the teacher are, 
briefly, a fictitious type of bearing (so different from the  
-P-A-G-E-308
298 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
frank and easy manner of the physician and business man), 
a devotion to method and petty devices, a didactic habit, 
and pedantry. “ And finally, in order to make the confes- 
sion complete, it must be acknowledged that we are pecu- 
liarly liable to fall prisoners to conventionality.” 
This characterization is, of course, not intended to do 
justice to the many open-minded, sprightly members who 
adorn the profession, but it is one more justification for the 
plea that the primary schools introduce more plasticity, more 
humor, into their régime. It may also justify a serious 
consideration of the subject of this chapter. 
Do the pupils themselves, when they can exercise judg- 
ment, think that their teachers are overconventional, over- 
serious ? We received a substantial answer to this question 
from sixty-seven normal-school students. We simply asked. 
them to count up the number of teachers they had had up 
to graduation from high school (the number totaled 1679), 
and then to count the number of teachers they distinctly 
remembered as having a sense of humor or fun in the school- 
room. This number amounted to only 224, or less than 
14 per cent of the total. Forty-four, or two thirds of the 
students, remembered either three, two, one, or no teachers 
answering this description. Although the students were 
asked to do no more than give the figures, it is interesting to 
know that they volunteered remarks like the following about 
those teachers with humor. ‘‘ She was the best liked of all” ; 
“she had the best control over us”; “I just loved her and 
was always glad to see her coming.” One student to whom 
the question evidently appealed said, “I do not remember 
one grade teacher who could actually laugh heartily and live 
through it. Until I entered high school, I do not remember 
ever to have had a laugh worth while in connection with 
school work.”
-P-A-G-E-309
  
THE SAVING SENSE OF HUMOR 299 
Is it not high time for the schools to cherish the sense of 
humor instead of repressing it? Perhaps the humor sense 
deserves as much education as the number sense. There 
are all sorts of ways to educate the sense of humor in little 
children, but the ways and humor itself are so subtle that 
detailed methods are out of the question. Suggestion is the 
chief thing, for humor is at bottom an emotional reaction, 
and, like all emotional attitudes, is communicated conta- 
giously from its source. Vivacity—lively facial expression 
of the humorous through the alchemy of muscle reading 
—will often awaken. sluggish minds to like appreciation. 
Atmosphere, of course, is all-important, for the sense of 
humor will not thrive, except as a kind of instinctive rebel- 
lion, in the overserious schoolroom which does not permit 
the little comedies of error in the actual life of the day to 
be responded to. 
In the chapter on drawing we have suggested the possi- 
bilities of this fine, plastic medium for the expression of 
humor. If drawing were developed to its possibilities, most 
of us might be amateur caricaturists. Should we not bring 
more good, funny pictures to children? Appreciation of 
the comic in art is no less responsive to cultivation than 
appreciation of the beautiful. 
There is hardly an art which does not have a place for 
the expression of humor, — drawing, music, sculpture (clay 
modeling), dancing, dramatics, and literature. All of these 
arts are, or should be, represented in the primary school, 
and should, on occasion, be given a humorous turn — espe- 
cially literature. Why not double up the children a little 
oftener with ‘the joy of the purely funny ? 
The classic nonsense tale about Epaminondas and his 
Aunty shows that the seeds of milder philosophic humor 
may also be sown, or rather watered, in the primary grade.  
-P-A-G-E-310
  
  300 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
Epaminondas was a little negro boy who was not blessed 
with a high degree of “relational activity of mind.” He 
brought things home to his mammy, but in stupid com- 
pliance with previous correction. The cake he crunched in 
his fist; the butter he carried in the hat on his head; the 
dog he cooled to death in the water; the loaf of bread 
he tied to a string and dragged home. “O Epaminondas, 
Epaminondas! you ain’t got the sense you was born with; 
you never did have the sense you was born with; you 
never will have the sense you was born with.” You are 
one.of those numerous illustrations of the fact that too 
much mechanization is inimical to both individual develop- 
ment and racial evolution! The teacher need n’t moralize, 
but a day or two later she may have occasion to call some 
stupidly docile boy Epaminondas. The tale, as given in one 
of Sara Bryant’s collections, goes on to tell how mammy left 
six mince pies she “done” make, on the doorstep to cool, 
with the injunction, “ You hear me now, Epaminondas, you 
be careful how you step on them pies,” and then — and 
then — Epaminondas was careful how he stepped on those 
pies. Here the story ought to end. If the story is well 
told, and if the children have not been mentally repressed, 
they will see the point without further impersonation and 
narration; and this is education in humor, for, intellec- 
tually, humor is a relational activity of the mind which 
sees the point. 
There are all grades and degrees of humor. This might 
be expected when we remember that the smile probably 
had its origin in the grinning retraction of the lips which 
accompanied the physical enjoyment of a good feast, and 
that laughter was first associated with the digestion of the 
feast. To this day laughing and growing fat go together. 
In another chapter we have already shown that, as a relief
-P-A-G-E-311
THE SAVING SENSE OF HUMOR 301 
from constraint, laughing is an instinctive form of relaxa-. 
tion. It also has some primitive connections with the tickle 
sense, with play, and with the savage instinct of bullying. 
Even among the lower animals there are traces of mirth, 
smile, chuckle, and laugh. The sense for the humorous, in 
common with the other exalted powers of man, has a lineage 
that goes back to humble origins. An ‘interesting passage ; 
on this point is quoted by Sully from an essay by George 
Eliot: “Strange as the genealogy may seem, the original 
parentage of that wonderful and delicious mixture of fun, 
philosophy, and feeling which constitutes modern humor 
was probably the cruel mockery of a savage at the writh- 
ings of a suffering enemy. Such is the tendency of things 
toward the better and more beautiful.” 
As in the race, so in the individual, the sense of humor 
is capable of development. From the clownish and some- 
times savage fun of childhood to a gentle, sympathetic 
humor “saturated with reflection” is a long step, but not 
an impossible one. Even the great humorist Shakespeare 
had to elevate himself and his patrons from the lower levels 
to the higher. His early dramas, like “The Comedy of 
Errors” and “'The Two Gentlemen of Verona,” are full of 
buffoonery, mistaken identity, broad punning, and rustic 
horseplay. In his riper productions, like “Twelfth Night ” 
and “The Tempest,” the fool is philosopher and the jester 
exalted humorist. Can we not bring into child life more of 
this developing and developmental humor ? 
“The conservation of child life” is more than a phrase. 
It fully represents the deepest and most central of all 
problems and duties. We are not thinking of physical 
health only but also of psychic values. Physical health will 
always remain the first requisite, but life is more than 
circulation of healthy blood. The child will be a man, and
-P-A-G-E-312
302 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
- what will serve him best then are the generic qualities of 
childhood, elasticity and eagerness of spirit. The preserva- 
tion of these qualities is the conservation of child life and 
should be the highest ideal of education. 
As school and society are now constituted we can hardly 
behold the buoyancy and curiosity of a child without a 
vague dread that these life elements are probably doomed 
to die out. The school does not even consciously try to 
conserve them. All pedagogy is mainly bent on developing 
the virtues of obedience, accuracy, honesty, faithfulness in 
memory, faithfulness in conduct, skill in technique, per- 
severance, and a host of proprieties. Well and good, but 
it is significant that these virtues are the virtues of fixity, 
of mechanization, even of rigidity. In Royce’s terminology, 
they are the virtues of docility but not of initiative. 
No wonder that the schools turn out such large job lots of 
commonplaceness. We are not earnestly trying to preserve 
the most precious of life elements, the variant elements of 
enthusiasm and originality. The dullness, the routine, the 
solemnity, the inflexibility of the schools, kill initiative. 
If we make a rough inventory of the larger mental traits 
which every grown person ought to have for his own happi- 
ness and that of others, we surely must add many traits 
to the docility list given above. What this old world needs, 
in addition to the “training” of mind and morals, is a 
greater fund of untrained elastic spirit, flexible enough to 
take fresh, unbigoted attitudes toward things and problems. 
Let us try to enumerate some of these nondocility traits: 
toleration ; resourcefulness in work, play, leisure; genial 
interest in the commonest things of life; ability to see the 
point ; adaptability to new and suddenly shifting situations ; 
a sense for disproportion and keenness to see through the 
unwarranted pretensions of others; capacity to laugh aright
-P-A-G-E-313
   
  THE SAVING SENSE OF HUMOR 303 
at self and others; control over sensitiveness. (A silly, semi- 
jealous sensitiveness is one of the most universal causes for 
trouble in this world, —a human trait on which a bulky 
sociological treatise might be written.) 
These qualities, though they do not have much recog- 
nition in the textbooks of ethics and the current discus- 
sions of moral education, are of highest ethical import and 
value. To say that these fine qualities can be learned only 
in the school of life, and not in the life of the school, is 
pedagogical pessimism. The life of the school can be made 
rich and free enough to nourish them all. 
There is a marked and wholesome tendency in current 
thought which is casting suspicion on the whole value of 
the first years of primary-school education. We hear it said 
that it would be just as well, or better, if the child did not 
go to school at all until he is ten years old or more. But 
the last word on this great subject has not been said. The 
child life of rich and poor alike will suffer atrophy if op- 
portunities for expression and imitation at home are limited. 
It is not so much a question of home versus school as right 
atmosphere and healthful surroundings. Even in the pri- 
mary schools it is not so much a question of upsetting the 
whole curriculum as revolutionizing the spirit and method 
of conducting the school. We have tried all along to show 
how the humble materials in the reach of every teacher, — 
drawing, reading, writing, handwork, and even trivial busy- 
work, every occupation of the school, — can be hygienically 
used to develop the child, to speed the growth of his free 
and conquering spirit. If this cannot be done, let us say 
that Rousseau was right, and turn the little colts out to 
pasture and be done with it. 
But while the primary school exists it must have life- 
giving breath for the spirit of its children. The thick fogs
-P-A-G-E-314
  804 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
of formalism must pass out of the windows, and the saving 
sense of humor must enter. Humor is a large, life-giving 
trait, bound up with play, sympathy, and insight. It is 
related. to the relaxation reflexes, which have a biological 
origin and a psycho-physiological protective function. It 
is a natural means of conserving the intellectual quality 
of mental pliancy and the ethical quality of elasticity of 
spirit. It is a saving sense, and as such has an important 
office in the hygiene of mind and in an educational policy 
of conservation.
-P-A-G-E-315
CHAPTER XXVI 
FORMALISM AND CHILD PERSONALITY 
The overzealous parent at the door and the relentless 
timepiece on the wall conspire to keep an artificially pre- 
cocious atmosphere in the primary school.’ Order, system, 
detail, and prescription have replaced spontaneity, grace, 
initiative, and investigation. The spirit of childhood lan- 
guishes, and in its place stalk the stern figures of propriety 
and formalism. Children are variable, inconstant, and un- 
stable; like birds on the wing they dart hither and thither, 
glad of the very air they breathe. They work intensively, 
unevenly, in short periods of effort, and flourish in free- 
dom rather than in confinement. Mood, the unerring guide 
of childhood, may not be grafted on from the outside, but 
must spring from a joyous, inward response to a frank, 
healthy, childlike atmosphere. 
How often the most promising child in the room is 
thwarted in his growth by the incessant inhibition and 
prescription of the early grades. The eager, questioning, 
imaginative child cannot endure the dull tedium of per- 
functory instruction. He wants to express rather than to 
be always impressed. Life is new and invites exploration. 
He is not willing to memorize and visualize the symbols 
while the warm, living things which they represent are 
touching his elbow. 
We have in mind a little ragged, eager boy whom the 
schools are robbing of his most precious gifts. He commits 
the sin of talking out, for his responses are quick, sudden, 
305 
 
-P-A-G-E-316
306 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
and unhesitating. He is not always orthodox in the stories 
he tells, for he is so imaginative that he cannot inhibit the 
multitude of suggestions which dance into his brain. He 
is disorderly, for he is apt to laugh, sing, or exclaim in un- 
expected places. He is not attentive, for his vital, sensitive 
nature responds to every distracting call. He lives deeply, 
for a host of lovely associations cling around words and 
things, and lead him into rambling, personal recollections. 
He is running over with affection, a very lover of things; 
he wants to handle everything, to bring life into close rap- 
port with his own vibrating little body. He does not sit 
still, therefore, to wait his turn when the birds, stones, and 
flowers are formally passed for inspection. The stuffed bird 
takes on life immediately, and is like the bird who built a 
nest in his own yard. The dragon fly becomes the little 
quivering one he touched once when he was at play. How 
can he repress these bursting recollections and instincts 
until he is asked a question ? 
But such a child does not fit into the school routine; he 
irritates by his very virtues, and is hampered by his genius. 
If education were more sincere, instead of ostracizing such 
a boy, turning him off into a solitary corner, teachers would 
let the contagion of his love of life permeate the whole 
room. They would let the purity of his kinship with nature 
sift into the heart of every stolid little creature in the group, 
and would bend every effort to grow more of his kind. 
Child life and child motives are elusive, creative, elastic, 
and intuitive. Every growing thing in nature lives in a 
freer, more inspiring atmosphere than the modern child. 
The plants have a better chance of preserving their initial 
impulses and achieving their destiny. We do not make 
the bees rotate in order from flower to flower, nor tell the 
birds into which tree to fly. 
 
-P-A-G-E-317
  
FORMALISM AND CHILD PERSONALITY 307 
But the child is circumvented at every turn by well- 
meaning adults out of harmony with his intent; even his 
play is crippled by formal limitations and adult concep- 
tions of organization and courtesy. We cannot force our 
motives and our standards on children without arresting a 
natural process of growth. Why shut the children up in the 
prisons which we have made for ourselves out of inhibition 
and conventional standards ? 
Even if an utter revolution of program is necessary, it 
would be justified if we could, by such a change, preserve 
emotion, eagerness, and enthusiastic persistence in work. 
Programs are too inflexible. Periods should run over and 
run into one another. There are days when a protracted 
session, emphasizing and illuminating one idea, should wipe 
out all divisions into reading, writing, spelling, etc. These 
things are not ends in themselves, but merely the means of 
recording, illuminating, and impressing some idea. Chil- 
dren should think about the larger aspects of things and 
learn how to call in these technical accomplishments of 
reading and writing as messengers of their thought. The 
breathless hurry to read two pages or to spell twenty words 
or to write ten lines in a specified time is foreign to every 
impulse of childhood. It is mechanical, artificial, unreal, 
sophisticated, and is the refuge of tired teachers who need 
not then be resourceful or companionable. 
Take the programs down from the doors and seize upon 
the psychological moments when writing, reading, and spell- 
ing really express thought and make permanent ideas upon 
some central topic. They should be the means of objectify- 
ing, preserving, and enforcing ideas. The child’s personality 
cannot emerge and develop unless his emotions are stirred 
in vital accompaniment to his intellectual work. This is a 
natural law.  
-P-A-G-E-318
  308 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
The skillful teacher withdraws herself, and throws the 
burden of discovery and explanation upon the children. 
Give them a genuine problem, and then fairly turn them 
loose to solve and illustrate it in a variety of ways. How 
the children love to wrestle with problems, and how they 
enjoy their triumph when one is solved! Out of this 
wrestling and triumph personality is born. 
It is time to have a reckoning, to realize before it is too 
late the futility of pushing nature. There are certain basic 
instincts implanted in childhood which wedge their way 
through obstacles to the accomplishment of their purpose. 
The little child comes running to school pushed by curios- 
ity, energized by feeling, tingling with response to sensation, 
and reveling in images of past experiences, but the teacher 
discards these sharp-edged tools which make early work- 
manship easy, and substitutes dull drills. 
Little children work from impulse, desire, feeling, not 
from prescription. The child who enters the primary school 
to wrestle with its problems has no standards to guide him 
in his intellectual efforts, save those which have preserved 
him physically. He instinctively seizes upon that which 
pleases him, for pleasure in its highest sense has been his 
biological safeguard. He drinks because he is thirsty; he 
eats because he is hungry; and he is strengthened in a large 
measure by what he eats and drinks because he enjoys it. 
In other words, the feeling of satisfaction in the process 
has much to do with the benefits to be derived from that 
process. The recognition of this fact in physical hygiene 
results in prescribing laughter as a sauce to dyspeptic pa- 
tients, but the part that mood and feeling and instinct play 
in school life and in mental hygiene is often utterly dis- 
regarded. Instead of desire, feeling, laughter, and joy of 
attack, the pedagogue offers duty and formalism. 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
     
FORMALISM AND CHILD PERSONALITY 309 
Now a child’s sense of duty is a hard sense to localize. 
It will not be found functioning with his sense of sight, 
touch, smell, or taste. It is not instinctive or fundamental, 
like running, jumping, building, drawing. Let duty grow 
of itself out of love, joy, achievement, experimentation, and 
experience. 
It is the boast of schools that everything goes like clock- 
work. Such formalistic uniformity and concerted action 
are foreign to the grace, spontaneity, and individuality of 
childhood. Children who grow up under such systematized 
direction are denied the very essence of mental growth, 
which depends upon original, constructive effort. The 
child mind loses its power to organize, and becomes as in- 
consequent as an atrophied muscle. Nature endowed the 
six-year-old child with an impulse to investigate, pry into, 
and discover. Some primary schools are veritable tombs of 
deadened curiosity and initiative. 
What does the six-year-old child care for print? His 
fingers are itching for contact with things, and his legs 
are set’ for chasing butterflies. Too much formalism in 
childhood kills spontaneity and interest. Education can- 
not, by formulating courses of study, force intellectual 
functions. The laws which govern the growth of mind are 
as immediate and irresistible in their operation as those 
which govern the growth of the body. If we force either the 
one or the other, personality is foiled. Let us, by putting 
faith in instinctive impulses, conserve more of childhood 
to the race.
-P-A-G-E-320
  CHAPTER XXVII 
CHILDHOOD THE FOUNDATION OF YOUTH 
Jane Addams has just written a book which has been 
heralded as a classic. In many beautiful sentences which 
are uncommonly pregnant with truth, because they are born 
of actual contact with the deepest realities of life, she de- 
fends and glorifies the spirit of youth and “its immemorial 
ability to reaffirm the charm of existence.” In the words. 
of one of her reviewers, “It is as if the Lady Abbess of 
Chicago, with gently entreating eyes, held out to us the key 
to those cloistered recesses in youthful hearts where nature 
stores the elements of human destiny.” AJl of us who have 
to do with education need to learn these keys, — the 
primary-school teacher as well as the high-school principal 
who always talked about keeping quiet in the halls and 
never about life, —for the spirit of youth is not something 
altogether independent of the spirit of childhood. 
In every youth the experiences of adolescence will be 
modified by those of boyhood and girlhood, and the richer, 
the deeper the child has lived, the less revolutionary and 
disturbing will be the experiences of youth. The best 
foundation for a balanced idealistic adolescence is a full- 
filled childhood, and it is for this reason that the primary 
school has a share in perpetuating and nourishing that 
divine fire of youth “which is so vivid an element in life 
that unless it is cherished all is spoiled.” Let us agree 
that the spirit of youth is of all things the finest in the 
world, but let us remember that the child is father of the 
310
-P-A-G-E-321
CHILDHOOD THE FOUNDATION OF YOUTH 311 
youth. To save to the world the best in youth we must 
begin by conserving the best in childhood. 
G. Stanley Hall has emphasized the differences between 
the periods of childhood and adolescence. We are told 
that the former, especially between the ages of nine and 
twelve, is a period of relative stability, of independence, 
and of mechanical interests, — the golden age of memory 
and habituation. It would be a mistake, however, to extend 
this characterization back to the primary-school age, which, 
instead of being marked by stability and susceptibility to 
drill and discipline, is naturally full of the change and spirit 
of adolescence. It is perhaps a nodal point in development 
in somewhat the same sense as adolescence, and, like it, is 
fraught with deep potentiality. A summary of its psycho- 
logical traits would reveal many interesting parallelisms 
between the two epochs. 
After all, the primary-school child is himself very much of 
a burgeoning youth, only smaller and somewhat less romantic. 
He too is naturally full of ardor and creative enthusiasm, 
“of beauty, variety, and suggestion.” He too has spirit 
and is decidedly more than an unlettered youngster wait- 
ing with docility to learn the technique of culture, on 
the promise that it will be useful in later maturity. He 
has individuality, artistic temperament, and sense of per- 
sonality. If we only understood him, he is saying, “Lo, 
I am here, too, and must be reckoned with.” He is full 
of the joy of life and as impatient of dull routine as the 
spirited adolescent, though his rebellions are not as. drastic 
and dramatic. 
It is easier to say than to enact, but the truth remains 
that the first duty of school and state is to preserve his joy of 
life. Teachers should convince the child that life is beautiful. 
The primary-school child comes to school with the belief
-P-A-G-E-322
    
812 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILD LIFE 
that work is as lovely as play. he the zeal and pride with 
which he attacks his first intellectual problems, and the 
languor and discontent with which he often finishes them. 
Why is this ? Why has the eager, buoyant first-grade child 
often become the so-called lazy incorrigible of the grammar 
grades? What has become of the pride in work, the eager- 
ness to help, the dominating curiosity, and the warm, un- 
selfish affection for teacher and school? Why have these 
deep instincts been strangled in their very birth? Why 
have they not been preserved to brighten and inspire the 
effort of his later years ? Chiefly because school work loses 
almost immediately its intimate, human touch. It is sepa- 
rated from all emotional incentive and becomes the dry tedium 
of accumulating facts. Work is purposely made unlovely, 
too often associated with silence, punishment, and failure, 
while teachers emphasize false distinctions between it and 
play. Work and play, prescription and freedom, soon take 
sides against each other, and the child begins to show a 
preference; yet when he plays he works the hardest. Teachers 
have a puritanical habit of making work a duty and play 
a privilege. \The gospel of the schools should be that work 
is lovely, that work is a privilege, that work makes use of 
imagination, self-expression, and joyous coéperation, and 
gives the individual a personal power. This will be accom- 
plished only by changing the atmosphere of the school- 
room or workshop, by loosening the reins, humanizing the 
motives, and letting in some of the charm and personal con- 
tact that you meet in a studio where artists gather together 
to do creative work. 
It is of supreme importance that we preserve healthy, 
eager attitudes. The child’s emotional appreciation of life 
will be the foundation for the visions of his youth. From 
imitative play, friendly codperation, and dramatic rehearsal 
 
-P-A-G-E-323
  
CHILDHOOD THE FOUNDATION OF YOUTH 313 
of life as he sees it, he will pass into ardent longings for 
life as it should be. But the seeds of such victory are not 
sown in languor or silent inhibition, but in active, construc- 
tive daily living which awakens and makes use of the whole 
capacity of the child. 
It is our duty to plant the seeds of victory. The fires of 
youth burn with a peculiar intensity. “The blooming sus- 
ceptibility of sex’? makes the very blood press harder and 
hotter in the arteries. Everywhere, but especially in the 
factory and the street of the industrial city, is adolescence 
liable to storm, uncertainty, and perversion. 
Primary-school teachers should begin to change the tra- 
dition of the streets by educating the child’s capacity for 
healthy recreation ; but she cannot do this if all her time is 
given to reading and writing. She must make room for more 
self-expression along motor lines in handwork and games. 
She must not merely teach new words, but she must educate 
a taste for literature. She must, through dramatic play and 
social coéperation, organize the emotional life of the chil- 
dren. Organization of the emotions, the culture of the 
imagination, and the creation of compelling interests will 
be a safeguard against garish penny shows, and will start 
in their place wholesome occupations for leisure hours. We 
are suffering as a people to-day because we cannot spend 
our leisure except in excitement. The true and deeper things 
of life lie untouched by the majority of people. When re- 
sourcefulness in both work and play have been developed, 
the battle of youth is already half won. 
Humanitarian ideals of social service are the glory and 
safety of youth, but we must provide hospitable soil for 
these ideals by fostering the social instincts of childhood. 
Children in the primary school are not allowed to exchange 
ideas, communicate interests, or give help to one another ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-324
  314 THE CONSERVATION OF CHILDHOOD 
we cannot afford to penalize them if they speak to a neigh- 
bor, or punish them on the ground of cheating if they show 
a friend how to do a piece of work. The first lessons in 
altruism can begin early. 
Purity is another ideal which we-expect of youth but do 
not provide for in the years before the full seed of the corn. 
This ideal should not be forged in the white heat of blind, 
heroic determination, but should be the outgrowth of years 
of accumulating acquaintance with nature’s open secrets 
about plants and animals, about birth, heredity, infancy, 
and parenthood. A reverent contact with and wholesome 
insight into the elemental facts of sex may even begin with 
the study of nature in the primary school. In varied, subtle 
ways we can prepare the youth to look upon the grail of 
life’s reality. 
Childhood is the gateway to a larger experience, and the 
path over which the child is led broadens into the great 
highway over which the youth must walk alone. Here will 
be enacted the drama of the soul. Here will the child, now 
a youth, meet spiritual triumph or sordid defeat; but if in 
childhood the beauty of life and its freshness have been 
preserved to him, he will carry the blossoms of imagination 
and the fragrance of happy hours to guide the ardent feet 
of youth into clean, cool places. ;

APPENDIX 
THE MONTESSORI KINDERGARTEN 
I. Nore anp REFERENCES 
We add this appendix with some hesitation. After our book 
was ready for the press we became interested in the accounts of 
Dr. Maria Montessori’s work and the American reception of her 
much-heralded methods. There is the usual danger that such 
methods, because they have taken a concrete form in merchant- 
able apparatus, will be taken over in an ill-considered and half- 
considered manner. 
While the Montessori Kindergarten, with its social features 
and its modern expressions of Froebel’s philosophy and of 
Séguin’s pedagogy, must surely have something to teach us, a 
precipitous adoption of the didactic apparatus all out of its 
natural setting and needed support will have possibilities of 
harm as well as of good. The Montessori ideas should at least 
go through a period of slow, adaptive naturalization, instead 
of being welcomed with an emotional readiness that promises 
to make Montessorianism a new cult. 
We have attempted a preliminary critique of the pedagogi- 
cal aspects of the Montessori Kindergarten, calling attention 
only to its serious sociological implications. We have gone as 
close to the original sources as the circumstances permitted, 
and give below the references consulted.

II. History or tHE Monressort System 
The historical origins of the Montessori Kindergarten are 
interesting and help us to understand its meaning. In 1906- 
1908 a real-estate society, /’Jstituto di Beni Stabili, inter- 
ested in the social betterment of the poor population of Rome, 
established four home schools, or nursery kindergartens, in 
connection with a group of tenement houses under the manage- 
ment of the society. Maria Montessori, M. D., was chosen to 
direct these now famous Case dei Bambini, or Houses of 
Childhood. Here she found ideal opportunities to conduct 
her original experiments and to develop her system of auto- 
education. 
The control of these tenement kindergartens logically fell to 
Madame Montessori, who was both a dottoressa and a profes- 
soressa, being the first woman to receive a medical degree from 
the University of Rome and later a lecturer on the education 
of the feeble-minded at Turin and at Ronie. She has also been 
assistant of the Psychiatrical Clinic at the University of Rome, 
Director of the Scuola Magistrale Ortofrenica (for subnormal 
children), and a student of anthropological pedagogy and experi- 
mental psychology. In addition to her scientific perception of 
education, Dr. Montessori has a warm interest in social prob- 
lems, and her work must be regarded from the social as well 
as from the pedagogical standpoint.
-P-A-G-E-335
APPENDIX 825 
The ‘Montessori Method” has been adopted in two schools 
in Milan and in the Asili d’Infanzia of Italian Switzerland, 
where it is reported to be displacing the Froebelian system 
which formerly held sway. 
So we have here to reckon with a new kindergarten, which 
may come in conflict with the old. In what sense is it new ? 
Over a hundred years ago lived the great educator who, also, 
had an Italian name, Pestalozzi, and who, also, was concerned 
with the problem of the home. For over half a century he 
labored to simplify, to mechanize, to psychologize education, 
and sought “to render the ordinary means of instruction so 
simple as to permit of their being employed in every family.” 
The same mechanistic tendencies are present in Montessori’s 
autoeducation system, but in the presence of the tall tene- 
ments of the Italian ghetto she has reversed Pestalozzi’s dream. 
“Let us,” she says, “place the school in the home; not only 
that, but let us place it there as a collective property, and 
let us place under the eyes of parents the entire life of the 
teacher, in the accomplishment of her high mission” (11 metodo 
della pedagogia scientifica, p. 45). This is the social peda- 
gogy of Montessori, “ which solves the social and pedagogical 
problems which seemed impossible, and takes part in the mod- 
ern transformation of the home.” Just as. we have socialized 
dwellings, water supply, laundry, medicine, etc., so we must 
“socialize the maternal function” through the kindergarten, as 
a school in direct physical connection with the home. We make 
a mistake when we identify the name of Montessori with di- 
dactic apparatus only. She is to publish a volume on the 
Casa dei Bambini come Scuola in Casa, “The House of Child- 
hood as a School in the Home.” Her original kindergartens at 
Rome are literally nursery schools in the home. 
Froebel was the founder of the modern kindergarten, of 
both its nursery and its pedagogical features. We find in his 
writings and methods the equivalent of many of Dr. Montes- 
sori’s ideas. Much of the rhythm, game, and occupation activi- 
ties of the houses of childhood are found in the Froebelian
-P-A-G-E-336
326 APPENDIX 
gardens of childhood, and even the didactic sense material of 
Montessori has something in common with Froebel’s graduated 
gifts. Dr. Montessori’s makes it clear, however, that she does 
not approve a wooden use of such material, and that she would 
impose no arbitrary sequence of tasks or plays from without. 
She and Froebel alike emphasize the immortal principle of self- 
activity. Dr. Montessori calls it the principle of autoeducation, 
and has invented for its expression, not ten gifts, but an elab- 
orate system of some eleven hundred pieces of autosensorial 
didactic apparatus. 
Not from Froebel, but from Itard and Séguin, did Dr. Mon- 
tessori gain her inspiration for the methods of autosensorial 
education. She regards her work as the continuation of the 
efforts of these two French physicians — “ my illustrious prede- 
cessors ’?—and is generous in the recognition of their sugges- 
tive endeavors in the education of defectives. In 1801 Dr. Itard 
published his account of ‘‘ The Education of a Human Savage,” 
the savage of Aveyron, the idiot child whom hunters had found 
roaming wild in the woods. In 1864 Dr. E. Séguin published 
his classic treatise on “Idiocy, its Diagnosis and Treatment 
by the Physiological Method.” Séguin for the first time clearly 
demonstrated the organic relation between sensory and intel- 
lectual development, emphasizing the peculiar importance of 
touch and stereognosis. He introduced into the training of the 
feeble-minded the use of geometric insets and other graduated 
sense material. Dr. Montessori has elaborated and extended 
these methods to the education of normal children. Her experi- 
ence was first with the subnormal, and her conceptions of 
education bear the stamp of medicine and physiology, and of 
experimental rather than genetic psychology. 
Ill. Tue Drpactic Nursery 
The original Montessori Casa dei Bambini may be best char- 
acterized as a nursery-kindergarten-school in the home, *t where 
children from four to five years old read, write, and do number

APPENDIX 827 
work with a facility equal to that of children of the second 
and third grades.” How completely the maternal function is 
socialized in such a pedagogical nursery is well shown in the 
following regulations, to which the parents must prescribe. 
“The parents of children attending the Casa dei Bambini 
pay no contribution whatever, but they assume these impera- 
‘tive obligations: (A) To send their children to the schoolroom 
at a specified hour, clean in person and clothing, and with a 
suitable pinafore. (B) To show the greatest respect and defer- 
ence toward the directress and all other persons connected 
with the Casa dei Bambini, and to codperate with the directress 
in the work of educating their children. At least once a week 
mothers will be able to speak with the directress, reporting 
observations on their own children in their home life, and 
receiving from the directress notes and suggestions for the 
welfare of the children. 
“ There will be expelled from the Casa dei Bambini (a) those 
who present themselves in an unwashed and slovenly condition, 
(b) those who show themselves not amenable to discipline, and 
(c) those whose parents fail in respect to those placed in charge 
of the Casa dei Bambini, or in any way threaten to destroy by 
bad conduct the educational work which is the aim of the 
institution. 
“ Attention must be paid to the health and physical and 
moral development of the children by means of lessons and 
exercises adapted to their age. 
“There will be in charge of each Casa dei Bambini a direc- 
tress, a physician, and a caretaker. All children in the block 
between the ages of three and seven years have the right of 
admission to the Casa dei Bambini.” 
The charming pictures of the Casa dei Bambini at Rome 
show us no ill-lighted schoolroom, with rows of desks, “ de- 
signed to permit the greatest immobility,” screwed down to 
the floor. We see happy children moving freely through the 
large, unconfined spaces of garden and open-air corridors. They 
are playing on the floor or working at movable tables, eating
-P-A-G-E-338
  
828 APPENDIX 
soup at a luncheon in the courtyard, or singing an Ave Maria 
in the hall of a roomy cloister. And in the background are 
the figures of skillful women, — physician, directress, care- 
taker, and nuns, — who are guiding this happy, spontaneous 
life. The pictures are full of refreshing suggestions of health 
and freedom. 
The central principle of the Montessori education is the 
widely accepted one that children should develop freely through 
their own spontaneous energies and interests. Dr. Montessori’s 
distinction lies in the fact that she has bravely put this prin-— 
ciple into effect, and guarded, at the same time, the physical 
development of the children. “The children are left free to 
play when they will and they may sleep when they will.” 
Dr. T. L. Smith, who spent a day at one of the schools, says : 
“Tf one visits one of Dr. Montessori’s schools, the children all 
seem to be occupied in interesting play. Some are lying on the 
floor playing with blocks or strips of wood painted in different 
colors. Some are playing blindfold games, finding out by the 
aid of their fingers alone the shapes and sizes of objects and 
different textures of silk, satin, wool, or linen.... But the 
interest and attention of the children is never interfered with. 
If a child wishes to spend the entire school period of two hours 
in doing one thing, he is allowed to do so, on the principle that 
the spontaneous attention is a fundamental educative principle 
which must not be interfered with.” 
Another visitor, Miss Maude G. May, testifies likewise: “ No 
one who has visited any of the Case dei Bambini can fail to 
have been struck by the intelligence of the children, by their 
frank, simple manners, neither forward nor shy, by the atmos- 
phere of happy activity, and by the sense of discipline that is 
largely voluntary and rises out of this same activity.” 
The unthinking person alone will ascribe these excellent 
results to the cunningly contrived didactive apparatus, which 
may be bought over a counter. It must be remembered that 
the Montessori Casa is a school in the home, that the parent 
patrons are under important contract regulations, and that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-339
  APPENDIX 329 
children are under continuous skilled supervision for many 
hours. In the convent on the Via Giusti they are detained 
from nine until half past five, that is, eight hours and a half, 
and only one fourth of this time is given to school work. Dr. 
Montessori recommends that in summer the hours extend from 
eight until six, with poor children. She favors these long hours 
because they permit the serving of luncheons to and by the 
children, the rest and play periods, and the attention to the 
physical needs of the pupils,—all of which together make 
the brief lesson periods apparently so productive of educational 
results. A day’s program includes “the exercises of practical 
life,” like dressing and undressing (putting on the clean pina- 
fore); washing (the children wash themselves); dusting, ete. ; 
inspection of teeth, nails, neck, ears, face, shoes, clothing; light 
gymnastic exercises ; singing, dancing, and rhythm work; in- 
struction in walking, sitting, moving carefully about the furni- 
ture, climbing the stairs, etc.; speech exercises; luncheon, when 
the children serve the soup, carry bowls, wait at table, and wipe 
dishes; playing in garden; sleeping. 
Viewed in its entirety, then, the Casa det Bambini means an 
eight-hour day for the children, under the socialized maternal 
control of professionally trained women, with physician and 
caretakers assisting. Reading and writing are, after all, an 
unimportant feature of this eight-hour program, when com- 
pared with the hygienic and sociological features which seem 
to excite little attention. When we consider the Italian results 
and the American possibilities of the Montessori method, we 
must not attribute to the didactic material the large moral and 
motor results which grow out of a free, hygienic environment 
and the power of superior personalities. 
The moment that one reduces any philosophy of education 
to concrete, graduated material, it loses the unity and vital 
impulse which created it, and invites as many interpretations 
as there are individuals to handle it. The Montessori system 
is an eight-hour nursery-kindergarten-school, and not a set of 
purchasable didactic apparatus.
-P-A-G-E-340
  330 APPENDIX 
IV. Tue Writine anp Reapine Mrernop 
Teaching the kindergarten children to write has been called 
“the most striking and impressive of Montessori’s achieve- 
ments.” The accounts of this particular achievement stir the 
imagination. We read of “the explosion into writing,’ the 
dramatic discovery of the method, “the frenzy of writing 
which attacked and spread through the whole group of chil- 
dren.” Nearly all the pupils learn penmanship at four, and 
usually it takes only a month or six weeks before they ‘ burst 
forth into writing.” 
Unthinking people seize upon this achievement as the most 
important contribution of the Montessori education. It has 
been overadvertised and so “ overheralded” that we are left 
with the impression that American children can learn to write 
with ease and economy only by the Montessori devices. Does 
this necessarily follow ? 
In the first place, Montessori makes penmanship a kinder- 
garten occupation. A few years ago we were advised, on hygi- 
enic grounds, that children should not be taught reading and 
writing until the age of ten; now they are to be inducted into 
writing at the kindergarten age of four, though the period of 
muscular nascency may extend to the age of seven. Dr. Mon- 
tessori herself is coming to the conviction “that it is not 
natural for children under)six, unless they are overstimulated, 
either to read or write continuously.” This means that the 
hygienic and economic reasons for teaching reading and writ- 
ing two or three years before they can be jointly used with a 
motive in the natural communication and interpretation of 
thought remain to be established., 
There seems to be nothing new in the Montessori method of 
teaching reading. The intelligent primary teacher has been 
using games, cards, and action phrases for many years. In fact, 
the teaching of reading is not such a serious matter, and many 
children in America effloresce spontaneously into the power to 
read. However, it is still a question when the technique shall
-P-A-G-E-341
APPENDIX. 331 
be taught. Shall we hurry it into the kindergarten period or 
shall we wait until the child’s interests and activities are ripe 
for such expression ? Children can learn to read at three or at 
six. In the former case reading is merely a technical feat; in the 
latter it is a complement of the child’s more mature intellectual 
capacity. 
The Montessori method of teaching penmanship presupposes 
a preliminary course in sense training. The method is clearly 
an annex to the system of sensorial education, and does not 
represent the more naturalistic, genetic approach to the writ- 
ing problem. It has the merits of admitting play and inde- 
pendent effort, but it is in spirit alphabetic and logical rather 
than genetic. 
The sequence of exercises which lead to writing is as fol- 
lows: 1. Tactile discrimination of surfaces, rough, smooth, etc. 
2. Discrimination of weights. 3. Tactile exploration of out- 
lines of geometric forms, square, circle, etc. 4. Filling in of 
geometric designs limited by a frame. 5. Filling in of same 
limited by pencil marks. 6. Sandpaper alphabet over which 
the pupil moves his forefinger, associating the phonetic value 
of the letter with the movement. 
According to this sequence, writing does not make organic 
connection with the child’s instincts of drawing, imitation, and 
language. The writing becomes a technique-game, and the 
emery-paper letters are pedagogical toys. The more purely 
genetic procedure in learning to write places more reliance on 
spontaneous drawing as a means of learning to control both 
the writing instrument and the basal movements. The value 
of such spontaneous drawing seems to have little recognition 
in the Montessori system. Dr. Montessori substitutes the 
rather artificial exercise of filling in geometric designs. 
The same sudden bursts into spontaneous writing shown by 
Italian children cannot be expected in America, since our lan- 
guage is not phonetic. Even some of the Italian children do 
not manifest this sudden burst into writing, and need the 
assistance of the teacher (Jd metodo, etc., p. 236). American
-P-A-G-E-342
332 APPENDIX 
children would have special difficulties, because writing tech- 
nique and spelling are unfortunately two very distinct things, 
whereas in Italy one is equivalent to the other, and calligraphy 
is orthography. . To construct a simple illustration, an Ameri- 
can child and an Italian child wish to write the sentence, “I 
would like to buy my rye bread to-night.” The Montessori 
pupil, having learned his letters, simply has to think the sound 
of the sentence, and it writes itself. This is the spontaneous 
burst into writing. In his vernacular he spells Jo vorrei comprare 
stasera il mio pane di segale. The American child, on the con- 
trary, even though he has learned his letters and can recog- 
nize them blindfold, would meet difficulties which might delay 
the explosion, as w/ in would, the e in like, the wu in buy, the e 
in rye, the a in bread, and the gh in night. The phonograms 
ike and ight, to be sure, may be taught by the sandpaper, but 
this destroys the simplicity of the method, and after all there 
is no need of teaching the American primary child as though 
he were blind; the visual image of the whole word is so much 
more natural. The word method of teaching writing is quite 
feasible, and when it is preceded by drawing and rhythmic 
picture writing, the acquisition of penmanship in our country 
may be a hygienic, joyous task. 
The muscles are the machinery by which man projects his 
ideas, and their training should from the beginning be the 
result of the execution of ideas. For instance, to write, a child 
must learn to control his pencil. How shall he do it? Not by 
setting mechanical limitations for himself, as the filling in of 
outlines of various geometric forms, but by utilizing, in bold 
freehand drawing, his instinctive and creative desire for repre- 
sentation, —by projecting on the blackboard a representation 
of rhythmic ideas which direct and inhibit muscular action in 
the very process of representation; in other words, he should 
achieve muscular control by the expression of native ideas 
rather than by fixing limitations from without.  
-P-A-G-E-343
  APPENDIX 333 
V. Tue Sensorrat APPARATUS 
The autosensorial scheme of education bears the marks of 
its origin, that is, the laboratory material for the experimental 
psychology of the senses and the methods used in training the 
perception of defectives, —the blind, deaf, dumb, and feeble- 
minded. It comprises an impressive array of sense material 
designed to bring into the consciousness of childhood, not 
things, but the qualities of things, that is, hundreds of grad- 
uated colors, sounds, sizes, shapes, lengths, widths, tempera- 
tures, etc. It is not a scheme of object teaching; the separate 
qualities of objects are didactically isolated from the objects, 
for technical discrimination and attention. This method has 
worked in the training of sense defectives. 
A word of caution is in order with respect to the general 
tendency to take over, without criticism, the findings from 
experience with subnormal children, and to transfer them to 
the normal child. Especially is this true of the learning proc- 
ess, where it would be much safer to get our suggestions for 
the education of normal children from the learning processes 
of genius, or of the supernormal, for normal children tend to 
learn like geniuses rather than like idiots. They divine truth; 
they make short cuts; they work with wholes and as whole 
beings, not with isolated aspects; they imbibe and assimilate ; 
their reactions to nature are not analytic-synthetic. 
The fact that methods of sensorial training have proved useful 
with sense defectives and those mentally deficient must there- 
fore be used with due caution. In our country a well-considered 
system of sensorial education has been in use and development 
for some twenty years in The Massachusetts State School for the 
Feeble-Minded, where the great Séguin himself taught for a short 
time. Dr. Walter E. Fernald, superintendent of this institution, 
has been especially successful in the training of the lower grades 
of feeble-mindedness. He emphasizes that success depends upon 
carefully following a progressive, predetermined sequence, be- 
ginning with the simplest exercises, such as picking paper from

the floor. While the sense material is simple, it is very impor- 
tant that the training be conducted “in the most painstaking, 
conscientious, and thorough manner by a teacher” who has 
herself been trained in the method and meaning of the work. 
The principle underlying the work, especially as applied to the 
training of the feeble-minded, is stated by Dr. Fernald as follows: 
“ The physiological exercise and education of the special senses, 
and the training of the voluntary muscles to directed accurate re- 
sponse, must precede and prepare the way for so-called intellec- 
tualtraining. The intelligent use of the special senses is the asib 
of all knowledge. The inactive special senses, the or 
avenues of approach to the central intelligence, must be opene 
up by a series of carefully arranged sensorial gymnastics.” 
That feeble minds are ever made normal or nearly normal by 
such methods is a sheer impossibility. While admitting that 
normal children have “a sense hunger” which the average 
schoolroom poorly meets, it may well be questioned whether we 
should therefore resort, in our common schools, to a refinement 
of the sense material and the didactic methods employed with 
the feeble-minded. Dr. Fernald himself recognizes that in nor- 
mal infancy and childhood “the extraordinary activity of the 
special senses, and an innate spontaneity of action, enable the 
child to rapidly acquire a wide experience. His acute powers 
of attention, observation, and perception, impelling him to 
closest scrutiny and investigation of each new thing, and his 
countless experiments in physics, all of which we call play, 
are the means adopted by nature to exercise and develop the 
faculties. . . . This control of the body and its functions, and 
familiarity with the simple properties of matter and force, 
which a normal child seems to acquire almost intuitively, can 
be gained by these (feeble-minded) children only after a long- 
continued process of training.” 
There is one fallacy about this matter which deserves clearer 
recognition. Many of the possible results from “sense training” 
are not due at all to the development of sense susceptibility 
or sensory capacity. The beneficial part of the training is
-P-A-G-E-345
  APPENDIX. 335 
motor, due to the motor adaptations of attention, observation, 
discrimination, and delicate handling. Zhis so-called sense 
training is valuable for the feeble-minded, not because it is sense 
training, but because it is motor training. The sense material 
conveniently furnishes the simple, isolated stimuli to which the 
feeble mind may be made to attend, but the attention is pri- 
marily a motor process of handling, touching, listening, lifting, 
pressing, coérdinating eye movements and hand movements, 
etc. Even in tasting and smelling, muscles play a part. Percep- 
tion is not a receptive but an active motor process; the motor 
neurons, or at least efferent impulses, are always involved. 
It is the motor element of response to simple serial situa- 
tions which makes “ sensorial” training beneficial to inferior 
minds, but with normal children these organizing, educative 
motor reactions grow out of natural contact with real objects, 
and this motor response is best furthered, not by imposing 
external restrictions in directive sensorial stimuli, but by mak- 
ing use of the internal motives which grow out of natural curi- 
osity and workmanship, the instincts of play and work. Instead 
of taking recourse to didactic sensorial apparatus, let us, even 
in the tenement districts, hold to our faith in nature, elemen- 
tary science, and handwork. 
One of the threatening evils of education is oversophistica- 
tion. It is so easy to philosophize and to become mysteriously 
didactic, to surround the everyday natural interests and charac- 
teristics of childhood with impenetrable psychological analysis. 
The great teachers of the world are those who have met youth 
and childhood in simple, natural, personal contact, —who have 
brought education into naive relations with nature. Our school 
system does not need devices, technical apparatus, graduated 
and systematized processes. No such order and progression 
exist in the child’s learning process. He is equipped with 
delicate perception and endowed with instinctive self-activity 
which enables him to discover and assimilate a multitude of 
tactile, motor, and visual impressions in the daily round of his 
natural experiences. :
-P-A-G-E-346
  
336 APPENDIX 
It is disastrous to admit that it is impossible for babies of 
two, three, and four to find a stimulating environment in the 
home, and that the mothers of the country shall transfer to 
the schools the function of educating these little children in 
sense perception. The majority of children find ample oppor- 
tunity in their daily domestic excursions to handle various 
forms, to touch hard, soft, smooth, elastic surfaces. The baby 
crawling on the floor begins to run his fingers over the carpet, 
the furniture, the windowpane, the soft dress his mother 
wears, her hair, etc. He plays by the hour with this thing and 
that, unconsciously assimilating, sifting, enjoying, and compar- 
ing a multitude of impressions, very many of which cannot be 
incorporated even into the most elaborate sensorial apparatus. 
Why take such natural experience and reduce it to a series 0 
graduated, self-conscious impressions, bringing into the class- 
room a lot of unnecessary paraphernalia ? The modern kinder- 
gartners find themselves hampered by similar static material, 
and many of them are discarding it for more easy, natural 
contact with useful, commonplace material. It is again the 
question of the logical versus the genetic order in education. 
We have, after a long struggle, dragged the schoolmaster’s 
mind away from the logical, alphabetic, serial method of 
educating little children. Kindergarten and primary school 
alike need practical contact with life, science, and manual 
work. We must make use of the bountiful experiences and 
phenomena of everyday life and not construct an artificial 
series of boxed experiences increasing in refinement and mak- 
ing no useful whole,—no familiar object about which the 
child should be informed. 
It cannot very well be argued that such sense training is 
to be only supplementary to natural contact with life, for, in 
America at least, the danger is that it will become a substi- 
tute, not a supplement. In the Italian Casa dei Bambini the 
children spend an eight-hour day. 
Nor can it be argued with conclusiveness that this spe- 
cial sense training will increase the general susceptibility 
|
-P-A-G-E-347
  APPENDIX 337 
and keenness of the child’s perception of nature. In fact, the 
experimental studies on this very point (by Thorndike and 
Woodworth) in American laboratories show that there is no 
“mysterious transfer of practice,” —that the influence of im- 
provement in one mental function upon the efficiency of other 
functions is very small; for instance, training in the estima- 
tion of magnitudes and weights had little influence on the 
ability in the estimation of magnitudes and weights of the 
same general sort. 
Moreover, the moment that one insists upon elaborate didac- 
tic material, the natural relation of the child to life is in danger. 
Especially in the hands of inexperienced teachers this gradu- 
ated sense training will become sophisticated, both for the 
teacher and for the child, and will inject an analytical, sophis- 
ticated self-consciousness into his otherwise naive relations to 
the colors and shapes of nature, — to the rainbow, to crystals, 
and to the spectral hues on his soap bubble. 
These strictures do not apply with equal force to the arith- 
metical didactic material, for here emotion and the natural unity 
of things do not count for so much, and quantitative analytic 
attitudes are appropriate. The Montessori arithmetical appa- 
ratus has many excellent uses. 
But in other departments of life it is the appreciation of 
things which counts, and not the knowledge of their abstract 
qualities. Assimilation must take place as an accompaniment 
of a psychic experience. The child develops in the afterglow 
of feeling and understanding which follow contact with real 
objects in their natural relation to life. A knowledge of the 
chromatic musical scale, or a quick recognition of shades and 
tints, is not the starting point of artistic creation, but a final 
result of the needs of execution. 
There is no doubt that one can teach a little child almost 
anything, but he is standing on the threshold of life. Life calls 
to him to come to investigate, to inquire, to live. Let us, then, 
open the way for an easy, natural contact with live things, and 
not use up his vibrant energy upon artificial experiences.

VI. Tue Tracuer’s Parr 
There is, at the present writing, only one person in this 
country who has been trained by Dr. Montessori in the prac- 
tice and principles of her method. In spite of this, factory 
machinery is being set up for the wholesale production of her 
didactic materials. This raises some questions about the rela- 
tion of the teacher to the material and the method. When the 
Montessori system was first commercially introduced to the 
American public, we were told that any parent or teacher who 
had a little leisure to read the accompanying handbook might 
place the didactic apparatus in the hands of the children, who 
would play themselves into knowledge. 
Dr. Montessori has been called an educational wonder-worker, 
but it is safe to say that the magic power does not reside in the 
didactic material. Her philosophy is the liberty of self-activity 
in the pupils; her method, that of “autosensorial education.” 
It is autoeducation, but it is not automatic. If it succeeds, it 
will succeed only in the hands of the most skillful and under- 
standing teachers. Dr. Theodate L. Smith, who saw the schools 
at Rome, declares, “ There is no system that requires a more 
‘careful training of its teachers.” 
Dr. Montessori herself leaves no doubt on this matter, in 
her chapter, “How the Teacher should Teach” (J/ metodo, ete., 
pp. 79-87). It is her wish that “the educator should be im- 
bued with a profound worship of life,” and should regard the 
child as a growing organism. The teacher must have a percep- 
tion for nascent stages and, while respecting the individuality 
' of the child, must direct his development, as one trains the 
vine, without pruning or thwarting it. In fact, Dr. Montessori 
has chosen the word “ directress ” to replace the word “ teacher,” 
which implies too much instructing intervention. The direc- 
tress, then, must restrain all corrective and ‘“ teachy” meas- 
ures, in order quietly and tactfully to direct. Such directing 
requires not only scientific curiosity and sagacity but scientific 
patience. |
-P-A-G-E-349
APPENDIX 339 
A class of about twenty-five can be directed by one Mon- 
tessori teacher and an assistant. Larger numbers make the 
principle of self-activity difficult of application. This has proved 
so true of our large American —and Italian — kindergartens, 
hat Miss Stevens, writing from Rome, makes this contrast be- 
ween ‘“ Froebel’s” system and Montessori’s: “ Froebel’s teachers 
are in front of their children, leading them, directing them ; 
Montessori’s are behind theirs, watching them, quietly remoy- 
ing all obstacles to their development, silently placing within 
heir reach all helps to their progress, but leaving the initiative 
entirely to the children.” 
In the Montessori kindergarten it therefore sometimes hap- 
pens that no two children are engaged in the same occupation. 
t may also happen that a child will spend the whole two 
nours of the school period in doing one thing, for Dr. Mon-. 
tessori wisely holds that a child should not be interrupted 
in wholesome activity. This, however, brings about a danger 
of overstimulation, and the directress must be not only an ex- 
pert disciplinarian (in the best sense) but a discerning guardian 
of the hygienic requirements of the child’s development. The 
eacher’s part is to discern, to direct, to regulate. 
This is a somewhat passive part, but it requires superior 
skill. Says Dr. Montessori: “ When she [a prospective teacher] 
vegins to find it her duty to discern which acts of the child 
she ought to hinder and which she ought to observe, then 
he teacher of the old school feels a great lack in herself, and 
begins to ask if she will not be quite inadequate to her task.” 
“The fundamental guide in the lessons is the method of 
observation, which is included in the principle of child liberty.” 
“Our intention is to give a ray of light and then pass on to 
something else.” ‘In fact, when the child educates himself, 
and the control and correction of his errors is left to the 
teaching material, it remains to the teacher only to observe. 
She must be more of a psychologist than a teacher, and 
here is proved the importance of the scientific preparation 
of teachers.”   
 
-P-A-G-E-350
  840 APPENDIX 
In the education of young children the teacher will always 
be of more importance than the method or the material. Miss 
Tozier describes the wonderful educational results achieved by 
Signora Galli-Succenti, a Montessori directress, in the worst 
slum of Rome,—results which in this case were proved to 
be independent of any didactic material, for the local school 
board was dilatory in providing the apparatus. “In teaching 
these children of St. Angelo in Pescheria, neither reading nor 
writing nor the use of the materials was the main aim or desire 
of Signora Galli and her assistant. Had these inferior ambi- 
tions been allowed to influence the work in the school, there 
would have been little accomplished in the long months of 
waiting for the didactic toys, —months that proved so yz 
able in the real education of the poor children.” 
Some of the finest things which we have found in Dr. Mon- 
tessori’s views are her ringing statements of the function of 
the teacher. She believes that “the figure of the old school- 
mistress, who labors to preserve the discipline of immobility, 
and wears out her Jungs in a shrill and continuous flow of talk,” 
must disappear. She believes it to be nothing less than a sacred 
duty for the teacher to preserve only the discipline through 
liberty, — ‘tthe liberty of the child in his free, spontaneous 
manifestations.” Her new emphasis of this old principle will 
be a service to the race. 
But the fulfillment of this principle in our country needs 
skillful personalities more than it needs didactic apparatus. 
Apparatus without trained personality in “the directress” will 
be insidiously dangerous.

IMPERIAL POWER FOR GOOD AND BAD 
MEN* 
Lur us exaraine the nature of the spaciousness 
and continuance of empire, for which men give 
their gods such great thanks; to whom also they 
exhibited plays (that were so filthy both in actors 
and the action) without any offense of honesty. 
But, first, I would make a little inquiry, seeing 
you can not’ show such estates to be anyway happy, 
as are in continual wars, being still in terror, 
trouble, and guilt of shedding human blood, tho 
it be their foes; what reason then or what wisdom 
shall any man show in glorying in the largeness of 
empire, all their joy being but as a glass, bright 
and brittle, and evermore in fear and danger of 
breaking? To dive the deeper into this matter, 
let us not give the sails of our souls to every air 
of human breath, nor suffer our understanding’s

eye to be smoked up with the fumes of vain werds, 
concerning kingdoms, provinces, nations, or. so. 
No, let us take two men, let us imagine the one 
to be poor, or but of a mean estate, the other 
potent and wealthy; but withal, let my wealthy 
man take with him fears, sorrows, covetousness, 
suspicion, disquiet, contentions,—let these be the 
books for him to hold in the augmentation of his 
estate, and with all the increase of those cares, 
together with his estate; and let my poor man 
take with him, sufficiency with little, love of 
kindred, neighbors, friends, joyous peace, peace- 
ful religion, soundness of body, sincereness of 
heart, abstinence of diet, chastity of carriage, 
and security of conscience. 
Where should a man find any one so sottish as 
would make a doubt which of these to prefer in 
his choice? Well, then, even as we have done 
with these two men, so let us do with two families, 
two nations, or two kingdoms. Lay them both to 
the line of equity; which done, and duly con- 
sidered, when it is done, here doth vanity lie 
bare to the view, and there shines felicity. Where- 
fore it is more convenient that such as fear 
and follow the law of the true God should have 
the swaying of such empires; not so much for 
themselves, their piety and their honesty (God’s 
admired gifts) will suffice them, both to the en- 
joying of true felicity in this life and the at- 
taining of that eternal and true felicity in the 
next. So that here upon earth, the rule and 
regality that is given to the good man does not 
return him so much good as it does to those 
that are under this his rule and regality. But, 
contrariwise, the government of the wicked harms

  themselves far more than their subjects, for it 
gives themselves the greater liberty to exercise 
their lusts; but for their subjects, they have none 
but their own iniquities to answer for; for what 
injury soever the unrighteous master does to the 
righteous servant, it is no scourge for his guilt, 
but a trial of his virtue. And therefore he that 
is good is free, tho he be a slave; and he that 
is evil, a slave tho he be king. Nor is he slave 
to one man, but that which is worst of all, unto 
as many masters as he affects vices; according 
to the Scriptures, speaking thus hereof: ‘Of 
whatsoever a man is overcome, to that he is in 
bondage,’’

ANICIUS BOETHIUS 
Born in Rome about 475, died about 524; consul in 510 and 
magister officiorum in the court of Theodoric the Goth; put 
to death by Theodoric without trial on the charge of treason 
and magic; his famous work “De Consolatione Philosophic’? 
probably written while in prison in Pavia; parts of that work 
translated by Alfred the Great and Chaucer; secured much 
influence for the works of Aristotle by his translations and 
commentaries. 
THE HIGHEST HAPPINESS? 
WHEN Wisdom had sung this lay he ceased 
the song and was silent a while. Then he began 
to think deeply in his mind’s thought, and spoke 
thus: Every mortal man troubles himself with 
various and manifold anxieties, and yet all desire, 
through various paths, to come to one end; that 
is, they desire, by different means, to arrive at 
one happiness; that is, to know God! He is the 
beginning and the end of every good, and He is 
the highest happiness. . . 
Then said the Mind: This, methinks, must be 
the highest good, so that man should need no 
1From “The Conselations of Philosophy.” The translation, 
of Alfred the Great, modernized. Boethius is not usually 
classed as a Roman author, altho Gibbon said of him that 
he was “the last Roman whom Oato or Cicero could have 
recognized as his countryman.” Chaucer made a translation 
of Boethius, which was printed by Caxton. John Walton 
made @ version in 1410, which was printed at a monastery 
in 1525. Another early version made by George Coluile wag 
published in 1556. Several others appeared in the sixteenth 
century.

other good, nor moredver be solicitous beyond 
that—since he possesses that which. is the roof 
of all other goods; for it ineludes all other goods, 
and has all of them within it. It would not be 
the highest good. if any good were external to 
it,, because it would then have to desire some 
good which itself had not. 
Then answered Reason, and said: It is very 
evident that this is the highest happiness, for it 
is both the roof and floor of all good. What is 
that, then, but the best happiness, which gathers 
the other felicities all within it, and includes, 
and holds them within it; and to it there is a 
deficiency of none, neither has it need of any; 
but they all come from it, and again all return 
to it; as all waters come from the sea, and again 
all come to the.sea? There is none in the little 
fountain which does not seek the sea, and again, 
from the sea it arrives at the earth, and so it 
flows gradually through the earth, till it again 
comes to the same fountain that it before flowed 
from, and so again to the sea. 
Now this is an example of the true goods, 
which all mortal men desire to obtain, tho they, 
by various ways think to arrive at them. For 
every man has natural good in himself, because 
every man desires to obtain the true good; but 
it is. hindered by the transitory goods, because 
it is more prone thereto. For some men think 
at it is the best happiness that a man be so 
rich that he have need of nothing more; and they 
choose life accordingly. Some men think that 
this is.the highest good, that he be among his 
fellows the most honorable of his fellows, and 
they with all energy. seek this. Some think that 
7
-P-A-G-E-23
Deane ee UU UIEEEIIEEEEREEREEneal 
THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
en UU RRREEEENRENAIREEEEE 
the supreme good is in the highest power. These 
desire, either for themselves to rule, or else to 
associate themselves in friendship with their 
rulers. Some persuade themselves that it is the 
best that a man be illustrious and celebrated, 
and have good fame; they therefore seek this 
both in peace and in war. Many reckon it for 
the greatest good and for the greatest happiness, 
that a man be always blithe in this present life, 
and fulfil all his lusts. Some, indeed, who desire 
these riches, are desirous thereof, because they 
would have the greater power, that they may 
the more securely enjoy these worldly lusts, 
and also the riches. Many there are of those 
whe desire power because they would gather 
overmuch money}; or, again, they are desirous 
to spread the celebrity of their name. 
On account of such and other like frail and 
perishable advantages, the thought of every hu- 
man mind is troubled with solicitude and with 
anxiety. It then imagines that it has obtained 
some exalted goods when it has won the flattery 
of the people; and methinks that it has bought 
a very false greatness. Some with much anxiety 
seek wives, that thereby they may, above all 
things, have children, and also live happily. Tru& 
iends, then, I say, are the most precious things 
fof all these worldly felicities. They are not,! 
Hindeed, to be reckoned as worldly goods, but asi 
‘divine; for deceitful fortune does not produce: 
tthem, but God, who naturally formed them as: 
‘relations. For of every other thing in this world! 
! man is desirous, either that he may through it} 
‘attain to power, or else some worldly lust; ex-: 
cept of the true friend, whom he loves sometimes 
8
-P-A-G-E-24
  
ANICIUS BOETHIUS 
  for affection and for fidelity, tho he expect to 
himself no other rewards. Nature joins and 
cements friends together with inseparable love. 
But with these worldly goods, and with this 
present wealth, men make oftener enemies than 
friends. By these and by many such things it 
may be evident to all men that all the bodily 
goods are inferior to the faculties of the soul. 
We indeed think that a man is the stronger 
because he is great in his body. The fairness, 
moreover, and the vigor of the body, rejoices 
and delights the man, and health makes him 
cheerful. In all these bodily felicities, men seek 
simple happiness, as it seems to them. For what- 
soever every man chiefly loves above all other 
things, that he persuades himself is best for him, 
and that is his highest good. When, therefore, 
he has acquired that, he imagines that he may 
be very happy. I do not deny that these goods 
and this happiness are the highest good of this 
present life. For every man considers that thing 
best which he chiefly loves above other things; 
and therefore he persuades himself that he is 
very happy if he can obtain what he then most 
desires. Is not now clearly enough shown to 
thee the form of the false goods, that is, then, 
possessions, dignity, and power, and glory, and 
pleasure? Concerging pleasure Epicurus the 
philosopher said, when he inquired concerning all 
those other goods which we before mentioned; 
then said he that pleasure was the highest good, 
because all the other goods which we before 
mentioned gratify the mind and delight it, but 
pleasure alone chiefly gratifies the body. 
But we will still speak concerning the nature 
9
-P-A-G-E-25
—— ee 
THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  of men, and concerning their pursuits. Tho, then, 
their mind and their nature be now dimmed, and 
they are by that fall sunk down to evil, and 
thither inclined, yet they are desirous, so far as 
they can and may, of the highest good. As a 
drunken man knows that he should go to his 
house and to his rest, and yet is not able to find 
the way thither, so is it also with the mind when 
it is weighed down by the anxieties of this world. 
It is sometimes intoxicated and misled by them, 
so far that it can not rightly find out good. Nor 
yet does it appear to those men that they at. all 
err, who are desirous to obtain this, that they 
need labor after nothing more. But they think 
that they are able to collect together all these 
goods, so that none may be excluded from the 
number. They therefore know no other good 
than the collecting of all the most precious things 
into their power that they may have need of 
nothing besides them, But there is no one that 
has not need of some addition, except God alone. 
He has of His own enough, nor has He need of 
anything but that which He has in Himself. 
Dost thou think, however, that they foolishly 
imagine that that thing is best deserving of all 
estimation which they may consider most de- 
sirable? No, no. I know that it is not to be 
despised. How ean that be evil which the mind 
of every man considers to be good, and strives 
after, and desires to obtain? No, it is not evil; 
it is the highest good. Why is not power to be 
reckoned one of the highest goods of this present 
life? Is that to be esteemed vain and useless 
which is the most useful of all those worldly 
things, that is, power? Is good fame and renown 
10
-P-A-G-E-26
  ANICIUS BOETHIUS 
  to be accounted nothing? No, no. It is not fit 
that any one account it nothing; for every man 
thinks that best which he most loves. Do we 
not know that no anxiety, or difficulties, or trou- 
ble, or pain, or sorrow, is happiness? What more, 
then, need we say about these felicities? Does 
not every man know what they are, and also 
know that they are the highest good? And yet 
almost every man seeks in very little things the 
best felicities; because he thinks that he may 
have them all if he have that which he then 
ehiefly wishes to obtain. This is, then, what 
they chiefly wish to obtain, wealth, and dignity, 
and authority, and this world’s glory, and osten- 
tation, and worldly lust. Of all this they are 
desirous because they think that, through these 
things, they may obtain: that there be not to 
them a deficiency of anything wished; neither 
of dignity, nor of power, nor of renown, nor of 
bliss. They wish for all this, and they do well 
that they desire it, tho they seek it variously. 
By these things we may clearly perceive that 
every man is desirous of this, that, he may obtain 
the highest good, if they were able to discover 
it, or knew how to seek it rightly. But they 
do not seek it in the most right way. It is not 
of this world.

ST. THOMAS AQUINAS 
Born near Aquino, Italy, probably in 1225, died in 1274; 
entered the Dominican order; studied at Cologne under Al- 
bertus Magnus; taught at Cologne, Paris, Rome and Bologna; 
his chief work the “Summa Theologiw’’; his complete writings 
collected in 1787.

A DEFINITION OF HAPPINESS* 
Tux word end has two meanings. In one 
meaning it stands for the thing itself which 
we desire to gain: thus the miser’s end is money. 
In another meaning it stands for the near at- 
tainment, or possession, or use, or enjoyment of 
the thing desired, as if one should say that the 
possession of money is the miser’s end, or the 
enjoyment of something pleasant the end of the 
sensualist. In the first meaning of the word, 
therefore, the end of man is the Uncreated Good, 
namely God, who alone of His infinite goodness 
ean perfeetly satisfy the will of man. But ac- 
eording to the second meaning, the last end of 
man is something created, existing in himself, 
which is nothing else than the attainment or 
enjoyment of the last end. Now the last end 
is called happiness. If therefore the happiness 
of a man is considered in its cause or object, 
1¥From the “Ethics.” The complete works of Aquinas 
were published in 1787; but a new and notable edition was 
compiled in 1883 under the intimate patronage of Pope Leo 
XIIE, to whom is given credit for a modern revival of interest 
in his writings. 
12
-P-A-G-E-28
  ST. THOMAS AQUINAS 
  in that way it is something unereated; but if it 
is considered in essence, in that way happiness 
is a created thing. 
Happiness is said to be the sovereign good of 
man, because it is the attainment or enjoyment 
of the sovereign good. So far as the happiness 
of man is something created, existing in the man 
himself, we must say that the happiness of man 
is an act. For happiness is the last perfection 
of man. But everything is perfect so far as it 
is in act; for potentiality without actuality is 
imperfect. Happiness, therefore, must consist in 
the last and crowning act of man. But it is 
manifest that activity is the last and crowning 
act of an active being; whence also it is called 
by the philosopher ‘‘the second act.’’ And hence 
it is that each thing is said to be for the sake 
of its activity. It needs must be therefore that 
the happiness of man is a certain activity. 
Life has two meanings. One way it means the 
very being of the living, and in that way hap- 
Piness is not life; for of God alone can it be 
said that His own being is His happiness. In 
another way life is taken to mean the activity 
on the part of the living thing by which activity 
the principle of life is reduced to act. Thus we 
speak of an active or contemplative life, or of 
a life of pleasure; and in this way the last end 
is called life everlasting, as is clear from the 
text: ‘‘This is life everlasting, that they know 
Thee, the only true God.’’ 
By the definition of Boethius, that happiness 
is ‘‘a state made perfect by the aggregate sum 
of all things good,’’ nothing else is meant than 
that the happy man is in a state of perfect good. 
13
-P-A-G-E-29
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  But Aristotle has exprest the proper essence of 
happiness, showing by what it is that man is 
constituted in such a state, namely, by a certain 
activity. 
Action is twofold. There is one variety that 
proceeds from the agent to exterior matter, as 
the action of cutting and burning, and such an 
activity can not be happiness, for such activity 
is not an aet and perfection of the agent, but 
rather of the patient. There is another action 
immanent, or remaining in the agent himself, 
as feeling, understanding, and willing. Such ac- 
tion is a perfection and act of the agent, and 
an activity of this sort may possibly be happiness. 
Since happiness means some manner of final 
perfection, happiness must have different mean- 
ings according to the different grades ef perfec- 
tion that there are attainable by different beings 
eapable of happiness. In God is happiness by 
essence, because His very being is His activity, 
because He does not enjoy any other thing than 
Himself. In the angels final perfection is by 
way of a certain activity, whereby they are united 
to the unereated good; and this activity is in 
them one and everlasting. In men, in the state 
of the. present life, final perfection is by way 
of an actiivty whereby they are united to God. 
But this activity can not be everlasting or con- 
tinuous, and by consequence it is not one, be- 
cause an act is multiplied by interruption; and, 
therefore, in this state of the present life, perfect 
happiness is not to be had by man. 
Hence the philosopher, placing the happiness 
of man in this life, says that it is imperfect, 
and after much discussion he comes to this con- 
14
-P-A-G-E-30
  ST. THOMAS AQUINAS 
  
elusion: ‘‘We call them happy, so far as happi- 
ness can be predicated of men.’’ But we have 
a promise from God of perfect happiness, when 
we shall be ‘‘like the angels in heaven.’’ As 
regards this perfect happiness, the objection 
drops, because in this state of happiness the 
mind of man is united to God by one continuous 
and everlasting activity. But in the present life, 
so far as we fall short of the unity and con- 
tinuity of such an activity, so much do we lose 
of the perfection of happiness. There is, how- 
ever, granted us a certain participation in happi- 
ness, and the more continuous and undivided the 
activity can be the more will it come up to the 
idea of happiness. And therefore in the active 
life, which is busied with many things, there is 
less of the essence of happiness than in the 
contemplative life, which is busy with the one 
oceupation of the contemplation of truth.

the real authorship of this famous work. Many early edition 
pear the name of Thomas, including one of the year 1471 
which is sometimes thought to be the first. As against hi 
authorship it is contended that he was a prof: 
and that the use of his name in the first ed 
to a custom that belonged more to a transcri

own weight thou fall down to the things of 
earth. - 
For it is not by thy own thoughtfulness or 
endeavor that thou receivest this, but by the 
mere condescension of heavenly grace and divine 
regard; that so thou mayest advance in virtues 
and greater humility, and prepare thyself for 
future conflicts, and labor with the whole affec- 
tion of thy heart to keep close to Me, and serve 
Me with a fervent will. 
Son, the fire often. burneth, but the flame as- 
cendeth not without smoke. 
-And so the desires of some are on fire after 
heavenly things, and yet they are not free from 
the temptation of carnal affection. 
Therefore is it not altogether purely for God’s 
honor that they act, when they so earnestly peti- 
tion Him. 
Such also is oftentimes thy desire, which thou 
hast profest to be so importunate. 
For that is not pure and perfect which is 
alloyed with self-interest. 
Ask not that which is pleasant and convenient, 
but that which is acceptable to Me and My honor; 
for if thou judgest rightly, thou oughtest to pre- 
fer and to follow My appointment rather than 
thine own desire or any other desirable thing. 
I know thy desire, and I have often heard thy 
groanings. 
Thou wouldst wish to be already in the liberty 
of the glory of the children of God. 
Now doth the eternal dwelling, and the heav-

and of probation, 
Thou desirest to be filled with the Sovereign 
Good, but thou canst not at present attain to it. 
T am He: wait for Me, saith the Lord, until the 
kingdom of God come. 
Thou hast yet to be tried upon earth and 
exercised in many things. 
Consolation shall sometimes be given thee, but 
abundant satiety shall not be granted thee. 
Take courage, therefore, and be valiant, as well 
in doing as in suffering things repugnant to 
nature. ’ 
Thou must put on the new man, and be changed 
into another person, 
That which thou wouldst not, thou must often- 
times do; and that which thou wouldst, thou must 
leave undone. 
What pleaseth others shall prosper, what is 
pleasing to thee shall not succeed. 
What others say shali be harkened to; what 
thou sayest shall be reckoned as naught. 
Others shall ask, and shall receive; thou shalt 
ask, and not obtain. 
Others. shall be great in the esteem of men; 
about thee nothing shall be said. 
To others this or that shall be committed; but 
thou shalt be accounted as of no use. 
At this nature will sometimes repine, and it 
will be a great matter if thou bear it with silenee, 
In these, and many such-like things, the faith- 
ful servant of the Lord is wont to be tried how 
far he can deny and break himself in all things.

  and suffering things that are contrary to thy 
will, and more especially when those things are 
commanded which seem to thee inconvenient and 
of little use. 
And because, being under authority, thou darest 
not resist the higher power, therefore it seemeth 
to thee hard to walk at the beck of another, and 
wholly to give up thy own opinion. 
But consider, son, the fruit of these labors, 
their speedy termination, and their reward ex- 
ceeding great; and thou wilt not hence derive 
affliction, but the most strengthening consolation 
in thy suffering. 
For in regard to that little of thy will which 
thou now willingly forsakest, thou shalt forever 
have thy will in heaven. 
For there thou shalt find all that thou willest, 
all that thou canst desire. 
There shall be to thee the possession of every 
good, without fear of losing it. 
There thy will, always one with Me, shall not 
eovet any extraneous or private thing. There 
no one shall resist thee, no one complain of thee, 
no one obstruct thee, nothing shall stand in thy 
way; but every desirable good shall be present 
at the same moment, shall replenish all thy affec- 
tions and satiate them to the full. 
There I will give thee glory for the contumely 
thou hast suffered; a garment of praise for thy 
sorrow; and for having been seated here in the 
lowest place, the throne of My kingdom forever. 
There will the fruit of obedience appear, there 
will the labor of penance rejoice, and humble 
subjection shall be gloriously crowned.

that said or commanded this. 
But let it be thy great care, that whether thy 
superior or inferior or equal require anything 
of thee, or hint at anything, thou take all in 
good part, and labor with a sincere will to per- 
form it. 
Let one seek this, another that; let this man 
glory in this thing, another in that, and be praised 
a thousand thousand times: but thou, for thy 
part, rejoice neither in this nor in that, but in 
the contempt of thyself, and in My good pleasure 
and honor alone.

in iife or in death, God may be always glorified 
in thee.

THE SACK OF CONSTANTINOPLE* 
(1204) 
Tus night passed and the day eame which was 
Thursday morning (13 April, 1204), and then 
every one in the camp armed themselves, the - 
knights and the soldiers, and each one joined 
his battle corps. The Marquis of Montferrat ad- 
vanced toward the palace of Bucoleon; and hav- 
ing oceupied it, determined to spare the lives of 
all those he found therein. There were found 
there women of the highest rank, and of the most 
honorable character; the sister of the King of 
France who had been an empress; and the sister 
41From the “Chronicles.” This work is important; first, 
as a record, generally accepted as eminently trustworthy, and 
second, for its literary excellence, in which sense it has been 
held in peculiar esteem. George Saintsbury remarks that 
these chronicles “are by universal consent among the most 
attractive works of the Middle Ages.” They comprize one of 
the oldest extant examples of French prose. The passage 
here given was translated for this collection from the old 
French by Eric Arthur Bell, A translation by T. Smith 
was published in 1829. 
This sack of Constantinaple followed what is known as

  of the King of Hungary, and ether women of 
quality. Of the treasure that there was in the 
palace, I can not speak; for there was so much 
that it was without end or measure. Besides this 
palace which was surrendered to the Marquis 
Boniface of-Moniferrat, that of Blachem was 
surrendered to Henry, brother of Count Baldwin 
- of Flanders. 
The booty that was found here was so great 
that it can only be compared to that which was 
found in Bucoleon.? Each soldier filled the room 
that was assigned to him with plunder and had the 
treasure guarded; and the others who were scat— 
tered through the city also had their share of 
spoil. And the booty obtained was so great that 
it is impossible for me to estimate it,—gold and. 
silver and plate and precious stones,—rich altar 
cloths and vestments of silk and robes of ermine, 
and treasure that had been buried under the 
ground. And truly doth testify Goeffrey of Ville- 
Hardouin, Marshal of Champagne, when he says 
that never in the whole of history had a city 
yielded so much plunder. Every man took as 
the Latin Conquest. More than thirty sieges of the city have 
occurred, After the conquest here referred to Constantinople 
‘was occupied by the Latins. It was finally wrested from them 
by Michael Palwologus. The conquest of 1204 was achieved 
during the Fourth Crusade. By Latin Conquest is meant a 
conquest by Western Christians as against its long-time 
Greek rulers. This conquest was also inspired by the com- 
mercial ambition of the Venetians, who had long coveted what 
were believed to be the fabulous riches of the city. The Latin 
Empire survived for fifty-six years in a state of almost con- 
stant weakness. The conquest had no direct relation to the 
original purpose of the Crusades, which was the recovery of 
Jerusalem from the hands of the infidels, 
2 One of the districts into which the city was divided.

  much as he could carry, and there was enough for 
every one. 
Thus fared the Crusaders and the Venetians, 
and so great was the joy and the honor of the 
victory that God had given them, that those who 
had been in poverty were rich and living in 
luxury. Thus was passed Palm Sunday and 
Easter Sunday in the honor and joy which God 
had granted them. And they had good cause to 
be grateful to our Lord, for they had no more 
than twenty thousand armed men among them all, 
and by the grace of God they had captured four 
hundred thousand or more, and that in the strong- 
est city in the world (that is to say, city of any 
size), and the best fortified. 
Then it was announced throughout the whole 
army by the Marquis Boniface of Montferrat, 
who was head of the army, and by the barons 
and the Doge of Venice, that all the booty should 
be collected and assessed under pain of excom- 
munication. And the places were chosen in three 
ehurches; and they put over them as guards 
French and Venetians, the most loyal that they 
could find, and then each man began to bring his 
booty and put it together. Some acted uprightly 
and others not, for covetousness which is the root 
of all evil, prevented them; but the covetous be- 
gan from this moment to keep things back and 
our Lord began to like them less. Oh God, how 
loyally they had behaved up to that moment, 
and the Lord God had shown them that in every- 
thing He had honored and favored them above 
all other people, and now the righteous began to 
suffer for the wicked. 
The plunder and the booty were collected; and

GREEK FIRE IN BATTLE* 
Nor long after this, the chief of the Turks, be- 
fore named, crost with his army into the island 
that lies between the Rexi and Damietta branches, 
where our army was encamped, and formed a line 
of battle, extending from one bank of the river 
to the other. The Count d’Anjou, who was on the 
spot, attacked the Turks, and defeated them so 
completely that they took to flight, and numbers 
Mie drowned in each of the branches of the 
ile. 
A large body, however, kept their ground, whom 
we dared not attack, on account of their numerous 
machines, by which they did us great injury with 
the divers things cast from them. During the 
attack on the Turks by the Count d’Anjou, the 
Count Guy de Ferrois, who was in his company 
galloped through the Turkish force, attended by

fought near the Damietta branch of’ the Nile in-1240, Mr. 
Saintshury remarks that Joinville’s work ‘is one of the most 
circumstantial records we have of medieval life and thought.”

  his knights, until they came to another battalion 
of Saracens, where they performed wonders. But 
at last he was thrown to the ground with a broken 
leg, and was led back by two of his knights, sup- 
porting him by the arms. 
You must know there was difficulty in with- 
drawing the Count d’Anjou from this attack, 
wherein he was frequently in the utmost danger, 
and was ever after greatly honored for it. 
Another large body of Turks made an attack 
on the Count de Poitiers and me; but be assured 
they were very well received, and served in like 
manner. It was well for them that they found 
their way back by which they had come; but they 
left behind great numbers of slain. We returned 
safely to our camp scarcely having lost any of 
our men. 
One night the Turks brought forward an engine, 
ealled by them La Perriere, a terrible engine to 
do mischief, and placed it opposite to the chas- 
chateils, which Sir Walter De Curel and I were 
guarding by night. From this engine they flung 
such quantities of Greek fire, that it was the most 
horrible sight ever witnessed. When my companion, 
the good Sir Walter, saw this shower of fire, he 
eried out, ‘‘Gentlemen, we are all lost without 
remedy; for should they set fire to our chas- 
chateils we must be burnt; and if we quit our 
post we are for ever dishonored; from which I 
conclude, that no one ean possibly save us from 
this peril but God, our benignant Creator; I there- 
fore advise all of you, whenever they throw any 
of this Greek fire, to cast yourselves on your 
hands and knees, and ery for mercy to our Lord, 
in whom alone resides all power.’’

  As soon, therefore, as the Turks threw their 
fires, we flung ourselves on our hands and knees, 
as the wise man had advised; and this time they 
fell between our two cats into a hole in front, 
which our people had made to extinguish them; 
and they were instantly put out by a man ap- 
pointed for that purpose. This Greek fire, in - 
appearance, was like a large tun, and its tail 
was of the length of a long spear; the noise which 
it made was like to thunder; and it seemed a great 
dragon of fire flying through the air, giving so 
great a light with its flame, that we saw in our 
camp as clearly as in broad day. Thrice this night 
did they throw the fire from La Perriere, and four 
times from cross-bows. 
Each time that our good King St. Louis heard 
them make these discharges of fire, he cast him- 
self on the ground, and with extended arms and 
eyes turned to the heavens, cried with a loud 
voice to our Lord, and shedding heavy tears, said 
“Good Lord God Jesus Christ, preserve thou me, 
and all my people’’; and believe me, his sincere 
prayers were of great service to us. At every 
time the fire fell near us, he sent one of his 
knights to know how we were, and if the fire had 
hurt us. One of the discharges from the Turks 
fell beside a chas-chateil, guarded by the men'of 
the Lord Courtenay, struck the bank of the river 
in front, and ran on the ground toward them, 
burning with flame. One of the knights of this 
guard instantly came to me, crying out, ‘‘Help 
us, my lord, or we are burnt; for there is a long 
train of Greek fire, which the Saracens have dis- 
eharged, that is running straight for our ecastle.’’

AUCASSIN AND NICOLETTE 
“Aucassin and Nicolette” is the title of a French romance of 
the thirteenth century, the name of the author being un— 
known, The only extant manuscript of the story is preserved. 
in the National Library of France. Several translations into 
English are well known, among them those by Augustus Re 
MacDonough, F. W. Bourdillon and Andrew Lang. 
How the Count Bougart of Valence made war 
on Count Garin of Beaucaire,—war so great, so 
marvelous, and so mortal that never a day dawned. 
but always he was there, by the gates and walls 
and barriers of the town, with a hundred knights, 
and ten thousand men-at-arms, horsemen and 
footmen: so burned he the count’s land, and 
spoiled his country, and slew his men. ‘Now, the 
Count Garin de Beaucaire was old and frail, and 
his good days were gone over. No heir had he, 
neither son nor daughter, save one young man 
only; such an one as I shall tell you. Aucassin 
was the name of the damoiseau: fair was he, 
goodly, and great, and featly fashioned of his 
body and limbs. His hair was yellow, in little 
eurls, his eyes blue-gray and laughing, his face 
beautiful and shapely, his nose high and well set, 
and so richly seen was he in all things good, that 
in him was none evil at all. But so suddenly was 
he overtaken of Love, who is a great master, that 
he would not, of his will, be a knight, nor take 
arms, nor follow tourneys, nor do whatsoever him 
beseemed. Therefore his father and mother said, 
to him: .

  ‘ AUCASSIN AND NICOLETTE 
  **Son, go take thine arms, mount thine horse, 
and hold thy land, and help thy men, for if they 
see thee among them, more stoutly will they keep 
in battle their lives and lands, and thine and 
mine,’’ 
‘‘Pather,’’ answered Aucassin, ‘‘what are you 
saying-now? Never may God give me aught of 
my desire, if I be a knight, or mount my horse, 
or face stour and battle wherein knights smite 
and are smitten again, unless thon give me 
Nicolette, my true love, that I love so well.’’ 
‘‘Son,’’ said the father, ‘‘this may not be. Let 
Nicolette go. A slave-girl is she, out of a strange 
land, and the viscount of this town bought her of 
the Saracens, and carried her hither, and hath 
reared her and had her christened, and made her 
his god-daughter, and one day will find a_young 
man for her, to win her bread honorably. Herein 
hast thou naught to make nor mend; but if a wife 
thou.wilt have, I will give thee the daughter of a 
king, or a count. There is no man so rich in 
France, but if thou desire his daughter, thou shall 
have her.’’ 
‘Faith! my father,’’ said Aucassin, ‘‘tell me 
where is the place so high in all the world, that 
Nicolette, my sweet lady and love, would not 
grace it well? If she were Empress of Constan- 
tinople or of Germany, or Queen of France or 
England, it were little enough for her; so gentle 
is she and courteous, and debonnaire, and com- 
pact of all good qualities.’’ 
When Count Garin de Beaucaire knew that he 
would not avail to withdraw Aucassin, his son, 
from the love of Nicolette, he went to the vis- 
eount of the eity, who was his man, and spake 
31
-P-A-G-E-47
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  to him saying: ‘‘Sir Count: away with Nicolette, 
thy daughter in God; curst be the land whence 
she was brought into this country, for by reason 
of her do I lose Aucassin, that will neither be a 
knight, nor do aught of the things that fall to 
him to be done. And wit ye well,’’? he said, 
‘that if I might have her at my will, I would 
burn her in a fire, and yourself might well be 
sore adread.’’ 
“*Sir,’’? said the viscount, ‘‘this is grievous to 
me that he comes and goes and hath speech with 
her. I had bought the maid at mine own charges, 
and nourished her, and baptized, and made her 
my daughter in God. Yea, I would have given 
her to a young man that should win her bread 
honorably. With this had Aucassin, thy son, 
naught to make or mend. But sith itis thy will 
and thy pleasure, I will send her into that land 
and that country where never will he see her with 
his eyes.’’ 
‘Have a heed to thyself,’’ said the Count 
Garin: ‘‘thence might great evil come on thee.’’ 
So parted they each from the other.. Now the 
viscount was 4 right rich man: so had he a rich 
palace with a garden in face of it; in an upper 
ehamber thereof he had Nicolette placed, with one 
old woman to keep her company, and in that 
chamber put bread and meat and wine and such 
things as were needful. Then he had the door 
sealed, that none might come in or go forth, save 
that there was one window, over against the 
garden, and quite strait, through which came to 
them a little air. . . 
Aucassin was cast into prison as ye have heard 
tell, and Nicolette, of her part, was in the cham-

AUCASSIN AND NICOLETTE 
  ber. Now it was summer-time, the month of 
May, when days are warm, and long, and clear, 
and the nights still and serene. Nicolette lay one 
night on her bed, and saw the moon shine clear 
threugh a window, and heard the nightingale sing 
in the garden, and she minded her of Aucassin 
her friend, whom she loved so well. Then fell 
she to thoughts of Count Garin of Beaucaire, that 
he hated her to death; and therefore deemed she 
that there she would no longer abide, for that, if 
she were told of, and the count knew where she 
lay, an ill death he would make her die. She saw 
that the old woman was sleeping, who held her 
company. Then she arose, and clad her in a 
mantle of silk she had by her, very goodly, and 
took sheets of the bed and towels and knotted one 
to the other, and made therewith a cord as long 
as she might, and knotted it to a pillar in the 
window, and let herself slip down into the garden; 
then caught up her raiment in both hands, behind 
and before, and kilted up her kirtle, because of 
the dew that she saw lying deep on the grass, and 
so went on her way down through the garden. 
Her locks were yellow and curled, her eyes 
blue-gray and smiling, her face featly fashioned, 
the nose high and fairly set, the lips more red 
than cherry or rose in time of summer, her teeth 
white and small; and her breasts so firm that they 
bore up the folds of her bodice as they had been 
two walnuts; so slim was she in the waist that 
your two hands might have clipt her; and the 
daisy flowers that brake beneath her as she went 
tiptoe, and that.bent above her- instep, seemed 
black against her feet and ankles, so white was 
the maiden. She came to the postern-gate, and

  unbarred it, and went out through the streets of 
Beaucaire, keeping always on the shadowy side, 
for the moon was shining right clear, and so wan- 
dered she till she came to the tower where her 
lover lay. The tower was flanked with pillars, 
and she cowered under one of them, wrapt in her 
mantle. Then thrust she her head through a 
erevice of the tower, that was old and worn, and 
heard Aucassin, who was weeping within, and 
making dole and lament for the sweet friend he 
loved so well. And when she had listened to him 
some time she began to speak. . . . 
When Aucassin heard Nicolette say that she 
would pass into a far country, he was all in 
wrath. : 
‘*Fair, sweet friend,’’ quoth he, ‘‘thou shalt 
not go, for then wouldst thou be my death. And 
the first man that saw thee and had the might 
withal, would take thee straightway into his bed 
to be his leman. And once thou camest into a 
man’s bed, and that bed not mine, wit ye well 
that I would not tarry till I had found a knife 
to pierce my heart and slay myself. Nay, verily, 
wait so long I would not; but would hurl myself 
so far as I might see a wall, or a black stone, and 
I would dash my head against it so mightily that 
the eyes would start and my brain burst. Rather 
would I die even such a death than know that 
thou hadst lain in a man’s bed, and that bed not 
mine.’’ 
‘‘Aueassin,’’ she said, ‘‘I trow thou lovest me 
not as much as thou sayest, but I love thee more 
than thou lovest me.’’ 
‘‘Ah, fair, sweet friend,’’ said Aucassin, ‘‘it 
may not be that thou shouldest love me even as I 
34
-P-A-G-E-50
  AUCASSIN AND NICOLETTE 
  love thee. Woman may not Jove man as man 
loves woman; for a woman’s love lies in her eye, 
and the bud of her breast, and her foot’s tiptoe, 
but the love of a man is in his heart planted, 
whence it can never issue forth and pass away.’’ 
Now when Aucassin and Nicolette were holding 
this parley together, the town’s watchmen were 
coming down a street, with swords drawn beneath 
their cloaks, for Count Garin had charged them 
that if they could take her, they should slay her. 
But the sentinel that was on the tower saw them 
coming, and heard them speaking of Nicolette as 
they went, and threatening to slay her. 
“God,’? quoth he, ‘‘this were great pity to 
slay so fair a maid! Right great charity it were 
if I could say aught to her, and they perceive it 
not, and she should be on her guard against them, 
for if they slay her, then were Aueassin, my da- 
moiseau, dead, and that were ‘great pity.’”? . 
Aucassin fared through the forest from path 
to path after Nicolette, and bis horse bare him 
furiously. Think ye not that the thorns him 
spared, nor the briers, nay, not so, but tare his 
raiment, that scarce a knot might be tied with 
the soundest part thereof, and the blood spurted 
from his arms, and flanks, and legs, in forty 
places, orsthirty, so that behind the Childe men 
might follow on the track of his blood in the 
grass. But so much he went in thoughis of 
Nicolette, his lady sweet, that he felt no pain nor 
torment, and all the day hurled through the for- 
est in this fashion nor heard no word of her. And 
when he saw vespers draw nigh, he began to weep 
for that he found her not. All down an old road, 
and grass-grown, he fared, when anon, looking 
35
-P-A-G-E-51
    THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSIC 
    
     along the way before him, he saw such an one 
as I shall tell you. Tall was he, and great oO 
growth, ugly and hideous: his head huge, and. 
blacker than charcoal, and more than the breadth 
of a hand between his two eyes; and he had great 
cheeks, and a big nose and flat, big nostrils and. 
wide, and thick lips redder than steak, and great 
teeth yellow and ugly, and he was shod with 
hosen and shoon of ox-hide, bound with cords of 
bark up over the knee, and all about him a great 
cloak two-fold; and he leaned upon a grievous 
eudgel, and Aucassin came unto him, and was 
afraid when he beheld him. 
So they parted from each other, and Aucassin. 
rode on; the night was fair and still, and so long 
he went that he came to the lodge of boughs that 
Nicolette had builded and woven within and with- 
out, over and under, with flowers, and it was the 
fairest lodge that might be seen. When Aucassin - 
was ware of it, he stopt suddenly, and the light 
of the moon fell therein. 
“'Porsooth!’’ quoth Aucassin, ‘‘here was Nieo- 
lette, my sweet lady, and this lodge builded she 
with her fair hands. For the sweetness of it, and 
for love of her, will I now alight, and rest here 
this night long.’’ 
He drew forth his foot from the stirrup to 
alight, and the steed was great and tall. He 
dreamed so much on Nicolette, his right sweet 
friend, that he fell heavily upon a stone, and 
drave his shoulder out of its place. Then knew 
he that he was hurt sore; nathless he bore. him 
with that force he might, and fastened his horse 
with the other hand to a thorn. Then turned he 
on his side, and crept backwise into the lodge of 
36

  boughs. And he looked through a gap in the 
lodge and saw the stars in heaven, and one that 
was brighter than the rest; so began he to 
speak, . . . 
When Nicolette heard Aucassin, she came to 
him, for she was not far away. She passed within 
the lodge, and threw her arms about his neck, 
elipt him and kissed him. 
‘Fair, sweet friend, welcome be thou!?’ 
‘*And thou, fair, sweet love, be thou weleome!’? 
_ So either kissed and clipt the other, and fair 
Joy was them between. 
‘‘Ha! sweet love,’’ quoth Aueassin, ‘‘but now 
was I sore hurt, and my shoulder wried, but I 
take no heed of it, nor have no hurt therefrom, 
since I have thee.’’ 
Right so felt she his shoulder and found it was 
wried from its place. And she so handled it with 
her white hands, and so wrought in her surgery, 
that by God’s will who loveth lovers, it went back 
into its place. Then took she flowers, and fresh 
grass, and leaves green, and bound them on the 
hurt with a strip of her smock, and he was all 
healed. . . 
When ‘all they of the court heard her speak 
thus, that she was daughter to the King of 
Carthage, they knew well that she spake truly; 
so made they great joy of her, and led her to the 
eastle with great honor, as a king’s daughter. 
And they would have given her to her lord a king 
of Paynim, but she had no mind to marry. There 
dwelt she three days or four. And she considered 
‘by what device she might seek for Aucassin. Then 
she got her a viol, and learned to play on it; till 
they would have married her one day to a rich

king of Paynim, and ske stole forth by night, and 
came to the seaport, and dwelt with a poor woman 
thereby. Then took she a certain herb, and there- 
with smeared her head and her face, till she was 
all brown and stained. And she had a coat, and 
mantle, and smock, and breeches made, and at- 
tired herself as if she had been a minstrel. So 
took she the viol and went to a mariner, and so 
wrought on him that he took her aboard his vessel. 
Then hoisted they sail, and fared on the high 
seas even till they came to the land of Provence. 
And Nicolette went forth and took the viol, and 
went playing through all the country, even till 
she came to the eastle of Beaucaire, where Aucas- 
sin was.

Petrarch and Chaucer; published his “Chronicles,” covering

THE BATTLE OF CRECY'* 
(1846) 
Tue Englishmen, who were in three battles 
lying on the ground to rest them, as soon as they 
saw the Frenchmen approach, they rose upon 
their feet fair and easily without any haste, and 
arranged their battles. The first, which was the 
Prince’s battle, the archers there stood in manner 
of a herse and the men of arms in the bottom 
of the battle. The Earl of Northampton and the 
1The field of Crécy lies about thirty miles northwest of 
Amiens, in France. The English under Edward III, num- 
bering about 40,000 men, here defeated the French under 
Philip VI, numbering 80,000 men, the French loss being 
commonly placed at 80,000. 
Of the merits of Froissart, only one opinion has prevailed. 
He drew a faithful and vivid picture of events which in the 
main were personally known to him. ‘‘No more graphic ac- 
count exists of any age,’’ seys one writer. Froissart was first 
translated into English in 1525 by Bourchier, Lord Berners. 
That translation was superseded later by. others. In 1802- 
1805 Thomas Johnes made another translation, which has 
since been the one chiefly read.

  Earl of Arundel with the second battle were on 
a wing in good order, ready to comfort the 
Prince’s battle, if need were. 
The lords and knights of France came not to 
the assembly together in good order, for some 
eame before and some came after, in such haste 
and evil order that one of them did trouble an- 
other. When the French King saw the English- 
men his blood changed, and said to his marshals, 
«‘Make the Genoways go on before, and begin the 
battle, in the name of God and St. Denis.’?’ There 
were of the Genoways’ ecross-bows about a fifteen 
thousand, but they were so weary of going afoot 
that day a six leagues armed with their cross- 
bows, that they said to their constables, ‘“We be 
not well ordered to fight this day, for we be not 
in the case to do any great deed of arms: we have 
more need of rest.’? These words came to the 
Earl of Alencon, who said, ‘‘A man is well at 
ease to be charged with such a sort of rascals, 
to be faint and fail now at most need.’’ Also the 
same season there fell a great rain and a eclipse 
with a terrible thunder, and before the rain there 
eame flying over both battles a great number of 
erows for fear of the tempest coming. 
Then anon the air began to wax clear, and the 
sun to shine fair and bright, the which was right 
in the Frenchmen’s eyen and on the Englishmen ’s 
backs. When the Genoways were assembled to- 
gether and began to approach, they made a great 
leap and ery to abash the Englishmen, but they 
stood still and stirred not for all that; then the 
Genoways again the second time made another 
leap and a fell ery, and stept forward a little, and. 
the Englishmen removed not one foot; thirdly,

again they leapt and cried, and went forth till 
they came within shot; then they shot fiercely 
with their cross-bows. Then the English archers 
stept forth one pace and let fly their arrows so 
wholly and so thick, that it seemed snow. When 
the Genoways felt the arrows piereing through 
heads, arms, and breasts, many of them east down 
their eross-bows, and did eut their strings and 
returned discomfited. When the French King saw 
them fly away, he said, ‘‘Slay these rascals, for 
they shall let and trouble us without reason.’’ 
Then ye should have seen the men of arms dash 
in among them and killed a great number of 
them; and ever still the Englishmen shot whereas 
they saw thickest press the sharp arrows ran 
into the men of arms and into their horses, and 
many fell, horse and men, among the Genoways, 
and when they were down, they could not relieve 
again; the press was so thick that one overthrew 
another. And also among the Englishmen there 
were certain rascals that went afoot with great 
knives, and they went in among the men of arms 
and slew and murdered many as they lay on the 
ground, both earls, barons, knights, and squires; 
whereof the King of England was after dis- 
pleased, for he had rather they had been taken 
prisoners, 
The valiant King of Bohemia ealled Charles of 
Luxembourg, son to the noble Emperor Henry of 
Luxembourg, for all that he was nigh blind, when 
he understood the order of the battle, he said to 
them about him, ‘‘Where is the Lord Charles my 
son??? His men said, ‘‘Sir, we ean not tell; we 
think he be fighting.’’? Then he said, ‘‘Sirs, ye 
are my men, my companions and friends in this

  journey: I require you bring me so far forward 
that I may strike one stroke with my sword.” 
They said they would do his commandment, and 
to the intent that they should not lose him in the 
press, they tied all their reins of their bridles 
each to other and set the King before to accom- 
plish his desire, and so they went on their ene- 
mies. The Lord Charles of Bohemia his son, who 
wrote himself King of Almaine and bare the arms, 
he eame in good order to the battle; but when he 
saw that the matter went awry on their party, 
he departed, I ean not tell you which way. The 
King his father was so far forward that he strake 
a stroke with his sword, yea, and more than four, 
and fought valiantly, and so did his company 3 
and they adventured themselves so forward that 
they were there all slain, and the next day they 
were found in the place about the King, and all 
their horses tied each to other. 
The Earl of Alencon came to the battle right 
ordinately and fought with the Englishmen, and 
the Earl of Flanders also on his part. These two 
lords with their companies coasted the English 
archers and came to the Prince’s battle, and there 
fought valiantly long. The French King would 
fain have come thither, when he saw their ban- 
ners, but there was a great hedge of archers be- 
fore him. The same day the French King had 
given a great black courser to Sir John of Hain- 
ault, and he made the Lord Thierry of Senzeille 
to ride on him and to bear his banner. The same 
horse took the bridle in the teeth and brought him 
through all the eurrours of the Englishmen, and 
as he would have returned again, he fell in a great 
dike and was sore hurt, and had been there dead,

and his page had not been, who followed him 
through all the battles and saw where his master 
lay in the dike, and had none other let but for 
his horse; for the Englishmen would not issue out 
of their battle for taking of any prisoner. Then 
the page alighted and relieved his master: then 
he went not back again the same way that they 
eame; there was too many in his way. 
This battle between Broye and Crécy this Satur- 
day was right cruel and fell, and many a feat of 
arms done that came not to my knowledge. In 
the night divers knights and squires lost their 
masters, and sometime came on the Englishmen, 
who received them in such wise that they were 
ever nigh slain; for there was none taken to 
mercy nor to ransom, for so the Englishmen were 
determined. 
In the morning the day of the battle certain 
Frenchmen and Almains perforce opened the 
archers of the Prince’s battle, and came and 
fought with the men of arms hand to hand. Then 
the second battle of the Englishmen came to suc- 
cor the Prince’s battle, the which was time, for 
they had as then much ado; and they with the 
Prince sent a messenger to the King, who was 
on a little windmill hill. Then the knight said to 
the King, ‘‘Sir, the Earl of Warwick and the 
Earl of Oxford, Sir Raynold Cobham and other, 
such as be about the Prince your son, are fiercely 
fought withal and are sore handled; wherefore 
they desire you that you and your battle will 
come and aid them; for if the Frenchmen in- 
crease, as they doubt they will, your son and they 
shall have much ado.’’? Then the King said, ‘‘Is 
my son dead, or hurt, or on the earth felled?’’

“No, sir,’? quoth the knight, ‘‘but he is hardly 
matched; wherefore he hath need of your aid.’” 
‘*Well,’’ said the King, ‘‘return to him and to 
them that sent you hither, and say to them that 
they send no more to me for any adventure that, 
falleth, as long as my son is alive: and also say 
to them that they suffer him this day to win his 
spurs; for if God be pleased, I will this journey 
be his and the honor thereof, and to them that be 
about him.’’ Then the knight returned again to 
them and shewed the King’s words, the which 
greatly encouraged them, and repined in that 
they had sent to the King as they did. 
Sir Godfrey of Harcourt would gladly that the 
Earl of. Hareourt, his brother, might have been 
saved; for he heard say by them that saw his 
banner how that he was there in the field on the 
French party: but Sir Godfrey eould not come 
to him betimes, for he was slain or he could come 
at him, and so was also the Earl of Aumale his 
nephew. In another place the Earl of Alengon 
and the Harl of Flanders fought valiantly, every 
lord under his own banner; but finally they could. 
not resist against the puissance of the English- 
men, and so there they were also slain, and divers 
other knights and squires. Also the Earl Louis 
of Blois, nephew to the French King, and the 
Duke of Lorraine, fought under their banners ; 
but at last they were closed in among a company 
of Englishmen and Welshmen, and there were 
slain for all their prowess. Also there was slain 
the Earl of Auxerre, the Earl of Saint-Pol, and 
many other. 
In the evening the French King, who had left 
about him no more than a threescore persons, one 
44

  JEAN FROISSART 
  and other, whereof Sir John of Hainault was one, 
who had remounted once the King, for his horse 
was slain with an arrow, then he said to the King, 
“Sir, depart hence, for it is time; lose not your- 
self willfully: if ye have loss at this time, ye 
shall recover it again another season.’’ And so 
he took the King’s horse by the bridle and led 
him away in a manner perforce. Then the King 
rode till he came to the castle of Broye. The gate 
was closed, because it was by that time dark: 
then the King called the captain, who came to the 
walls and said, ‘‘Who is that ealleth there this 
time of night??? Then the King said, ‘‘Open 
your gate quickly, for this is the fortune of 
Franee.’? The captain knew then it was the 
King, and opened the gate and let down the 
bridge. Then the King entered, and he had with 
him but five barons, Sir John of Hainault, Sir 
Charles of Montmorency, the Lord of Beaujeu, 
the Lord d’Aubigny, and the Lord of Montsault. 
The King weuld not tarry there, but drank and 
departed thence about midnight, and so rode by 
sueh guides as knew the country till he came in 
the morning to Amiens, and there he rested. 
This Saturday the Englishmen never departed 
from their battles for chasing of any man, but 
kept still their field, and ever defended them- * 
selves against all such as came to assail them, 
This battle ended about evensong time.

PHILIPPE DE COMINES 
Born in France about 1445, died in 1511; after serving 
Charles the Bold, went over to Louis XI, in whose house- 
hold he was a confidant and adviser; arrested on political 
charges in 1486 and imprisoned more than two years; ar- 
rested later by Oharles VIII and exiled for ten years; re- 
turning to court, he fell into disgrace, went into retirement 
and wrote his “Memoirs,” the first series covering the his 
tory of France between 1464 and 1488, the second, the 
period from 1494 to 1498. 
OF THE CHARACTER OF LOUIS XI* 
I wave seen many deceptions in this world, 
especially.in servants toward their masters; and 
I have always found that proud and stately 
princes who will hear but few, are more liable to 
be imposed upon than those who are open and 
accessible: but of all the princes that I ever knew, 
the wisest and most dexterous to extricate him- 
self out of any danger or difficulty in time of ad- 
versity was our master King Louis XI. He was 
the humblest in his conversation and habit, and 
1¥From the “Memoirs.” Louis reigned from 1461 to 1483. 
It was he, more than any other king, who represt the power 
of the feudal princes and consolidated their territories under 
the French monarchy. 
Oomines has been called “the father of modern history.” 
Hallam says his work “almost makes an epoch in historical 
literature”; while Sainte-Beuve has declared that from it “all 
political history takes its rise.’ Comines was translated into 
English by T. Banett in 1596. he best-known modern

PHILIPPE DE COMINES 
  the most painful and indefatigable to win over 
any man to his side that he thought capable of 
doing him either mischief or serviee: tho he was 
often refused, he would never give over a man 
that he wished to gain, but still prest and con- 
tinued his insinuations, promising him largely, and 
presenting him with such sums and honors as he 
knew would gratify his ambition; and for such 
as he had discarded’ in time of peace and pros- 
perity, he paid dear (when he had oceasion for 
them) to recover them again; but when he had 
once reconciled them, he retained no enmity to- 
ward them for what has passed, but employed 
them freely for the future. He was naturally 
kind and indulgent to persons of mean estate, and 
hostile to all great men who had no need of him. 
Never prince was so conversable nor so inquisi- 
tive as he, for his desire was to know everybody 
he could; and indeed he knew all persons of any 
authority or worth in England, Spain, Portugal, 
and Italy, in the territories of the Dukes of Bur- 
gundy and Bretagne, and among his own_sub- 
jects: and by those qualities he preserved the 
erown upon his head, which was in much danger 
by the enemies he had created to himself upon his 
accession to the throne. 
But above all, his great bounty and liberality 
did him the greatest service: and yet, as he be- 
haved himself wisely in time of distress, so when 
he thought himself a little out of danger, tho it 
were but by a truce, he would disoblige the servants 
and officers of his court by mean and petty ways 
which were little to his advantage; and as for 
peace, he could hardly endure the thoughts of it. 
He spoke slightingly of most people, and rather 
47
-P-A-G-E-63
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  before their faces than behind their backs; unless 
he was afraid of them, and of that sort there 
were a great many, for he was naturally some- 
what timorous. When he had done himself any 
prejudice by his talk, or was apprehensive he 
should do so, and wished to make amends, he 
would say to the person whom he had disobliged, 
“T am sensible my tongue has done me a good 
deal of mischief; but on the other hand, it has 
sometimes done me much good: however, it is but 
reason I should make some reparation for the in- 
jury.’’? And he never used this kind of apologies 
to any person but he granted some favor to the 
person to whom he made it, and it was always 
of considerable amount. 
It is certainly a great blessing from God upon 
any prince to have experienced adversity as well 
as prosperity, good as well as evil, and especially 
if the good outweighs the evil, as it did in the 
King our master. I am of opinion that the 
troubles he was involved in in his youth, when he 
fled from his father and resided six years together 
with Philip, Duke of Burgundy, were of great 
service to him; for there he learned to be ecom- 
plaisant to such as he had occasion to use, which 
was no slight advantage of adversity. As soon 
as he found himself a powerful and crowned king, 
his mind was wholly bent upon revenge; but he 
quickly found the inconvenience of this, repented 
by degrees of his indiscretion, and made sufficient 
reparation for his folly and error by regaining 
those he had injured. Besides, I am very econ- 
fident that if his education had not been different 
from the usual education of such nobles as I have 
seen in France, he could not so easily have worked 
48

  himself out of his troubles: for they are brought. 
up to. nothing but to make themselves ridiculous, 
both in their clothes and discourse; they have no 
knowledge of letters; no wise man is suffered ta 
come near them, to improve their understandings ; 
they have governors who manage their business, 
but they do nothing themselves: nay, there are. 
some nobles who tho they have an income of thir- 
teen livres, will take pride to bid you ‘‘Go to my 
servants and let them answer you,’’ thinking by 
such speeches to imitate the state and grandeur: 
of a prince; and I have seen their servants take- 
great advantage of them, giving them to under- 
stand they were fools; and if afterward they 
eame to apply their minds to business and at- 
tempted to manage their own affairs, they began — 
so late they could make nothing of it. And it is. 
certain that all those who have performed any 
great or memorable action worthy to be recorded 
in history, began always in their youth; and this. 
is to be attributed to the method of their educa- 
tion, or some particular blessing of God. . . « 
Of all diversions he loved hunting and hawking: 
in their seasons; but his chief delight was in dogs. 
In hunting, his eagerness and pain were equal to 
his pleasure, for his chase was the stag, which he 
always ran down. He rose very early in the. 
morning, rode sometimes a great distance, and 
would not leave his sport, let the weather be 
never so bad; and when he came home at night 
he was often very weary, and generally. in a vio- 
lent passion with some of his courtiers or hunts- 
men; for hunting is a sport not always to be man- 
aged according to the master’s direction; yet in 
the opinion of most people, he understood it as.

  well as any prince of his time. He was contin- 
ually at these sports, lodging in the country vil- 
lages to which his recreations led him, till he was 
interrupted by business; for during the most part 
of the summer there was constantly war between 
him and Charles, Duke of Burgundy, and in the 
winter they made truces; so that he had but a 
little time during the whole year to spend in 
pleasure, and even then the fatigues he under- 
went were excessive. When his body was at rest 
his mind was at work, for he had affairs in several 
' places at once, and would concern himself as 
much in those of his neighbors as in his own; 
putting officers of his own over all the great 
families, and endeavoring to divide their authority 
as much as possible. When he was at war he 
labored for a peace or a truce, and when he had 
obtained it he was impatient for war again. He 
troubled himself with many trifies in his govern- 
ment which he had better have left alone: but 
it was his temper, and he could not help it; be- 
sides, he had a prodigious memory, and he forgot 
nothing, but knew everybody, as well in other 
countries as in his own, 
And in truth he seemed better fitted to rule a 
world than to govern a single kingdom. I speak 
not of his minority, for then I was not with him; 
but when he was eleven years he was, by the ad- 
vice of some of the nobility and others of his 
Kingdom, embroiled in a war with his father, 
Charles VII, which lasted not long, and was 
ealled the Praguerie. When he was arrived at 
man’s estate he was married, muck against his 
inclination, to the King of Scotland’s daughter; 
and he regretted her existence during the whole 
50
-P-A-G-E-66
  PHILIPPE DE COMINES 
  course of her life. Afterward, by reason of the 
broils and factions in his father’s court, he re- 
tired into Dauphiny (which was his own), whither 
many persons of quality followed him, and indeed 
more than he could entertain. During his resi- 
dence in Dauphiny he married the Duke of 
Savoy’s daughter, and not long after he had great 
disputes with his father-in-law, and a terrible war 
was begun between them. 
His father, King Charles VII, seeing his son 
attended by so many good officers and raising men 
at his pleasure, resolved to go in person against 
him with a considerable body of forces, in order 
to disperse them. While he was upon his march 
rE put out proclamations, requiring them all as 
his subjects, under great penalties, to repair to 
him; and many obeyed, to the great displeasure 
of the Dauphin, who finding his father incensed, 
tho he was strong enough to resist, resolved to re- 
tire and leave that country to him; and accord- 
ingly he removed with but a slender retinue into 
Burgundy to Duke Philip’s court, who received 
him honorably, furnished him nobly, and main- 
tained him and his principal servants by way of 
pensions; and to the rest he gave presents as he 
saw oceasion during the whole time of their resi- 
dence there. However, the Dauphin entertained 
so many at his own expense that his money often 
failed, to his great disgust and mortification; for 
he was forced to borrow, or his people would have 
forsaken him; which is certainly a great affliction 
to a prince who was utterly unaccustomed to those — 
straits. So that during his residence at the court 
of Burgundy he had his anxieties, for he was 
constrained to cajole the duke and his ministers,

lest they should think he was too burdensome 
and had laid too long upon their hands; for he 
had been with them six years, and his father, 
King Charles, was constantly pressing and solicit- 
ing the Duke of Burgundy, by his ambassadors, 
either to deliver him up to him or to banish him 
out of his dominions. And this, you may believe, 
gave the Dauphin some uneasy thoughts and 
would not suffer him to be idle. In which season 
of his life, then, was it that he may be said to 
have enjoyed himself? I believe from his infancy 
and innocence to his death, his whole life was 
nothing but one continued scene of troubles and 
fatigues; and I am of opinion that if all the days 
of his life were computed in which his joys and 
pleasures outweighed his pain and trouble, they 
would be found so few that there would be twenty 
mournful ones to one pleasant.

OF HUSBANDS WHO ARE UNFAITHFUL* 
A LITTLE company of five ladies and five noble 
gentlemen have been interrupted in their travels 
bv heavy rains and great floods, and find them- 
selves together in a hospitable abbey. They while 
away the time as best they can, and the second 
day Parlamente says to the old Lady Oisille, 
‘‘Madame, I wonder that you who have so much 
experience do not think of some pastime to 
sweeten the gloom that our long delay here causes 
us.’? The other ladies echo her wishes, and all 
the gentlemen agree with them, and beg the Lady 
Oisille to be pleased to direct how they shall 
amuse themselves. She answers them: 
“My children, you ask of me something that T 
find very difficult,—to teach you a pastime that 
ean deliver you from your sadness; for having 
sought some such remedy all my life I have never 
found bat one—the reading of Holy Writ; in

Codrington appeared in London in 1654.

  which is found the true and perfect joy of the 
mind, from which proceed the comfort and health 
of the body. And if you ask me what keeps me 
so joyous and so healthy in my old age, it is that 
as soon as I rise I take and read the Holy Serip- 
tures, seeing and contemplating the will of God, 
who for our sakes sent His son on earth to an-~ 
nounce this holy word and good news, by whieh 
He promises remission of sins, satisfaction for all 
duties by the gifts He makes us of His love, passion 
and merits. This consideration gives me so much 
joy that I take my Psalter and as humbly as I 
ean I sing with my heart and pronounce with my 
tongue the beautiful psalms and canticles that 
the Holy Spirit wrote in the heart of David and 
of other authors. And this contentment that I 
have in them does me so much good that the ills 
that every day may nappen to me seem to me to 
be blessings, seeing that I have in my heart, by 
faith, Him who has borne them for me. Likewise, 
before supper, I retire, to pasture my soul in read- 
ing; and then, in the evening, I call to mind what 
I have done in the past day, in order to ask 
pardon for my faults, and to thank Him for His 
kindnesses, and in His love, fear and peace I re- 
pose, assured against all ills. Wherefore, my 
children, this is the pastime in which I have long 
stayed my steps, after having searched all things, 
where I found no content for my spirit. It seems 
to me that if every morning you will give an hour 
to reading, and then, during mass, devoutly say 
your prayers, you will find in this desert the same 
beauty as in cities; for he who knows God, sees 
all beautiful things in Him, and without Him all 
is ugliness. .

“‘T beg you, ‘ladies,’’ continues the narrator, 
“if God give yeu such husbands,’ not to despair 
till you have long tried every means to reclaim 
them; for there are twenty-four hours in a day 
in which a man may change his way of thinking, 
and a woman should deem herself happier to have 
won her husband by patience and long effort than 
if fortune and her parents had given her a more 
perfect one.’’ ‘‘Yes,’’ said Oisille, ‘‘this is an 
example for all married women.’’—‘‘Let her fol- 
low this example who will,’’ said Parlamente: 
‘‘but as for me, it would not be possible for me 
to have such long patience; for, however true it 
may be that in all estates patience is a fine virtue, 
it’s my opinion that in marriage it brings about 
at last unfriendliness; because, suffering unkind- 
ness from a fellow being, one is foreed to separate 
from him as far as possible, and from this separa- 
tion arises a contempt for the fault of the dis- 
loyal one, and in this contempt little by little love 
diminishes; for it is what is valued that is loved.’’ 
—‘But there is danger,’’ said Ennarsuite, ‘‘that 
the impatient wife may find a furious husband, 
who would give her pain in lieu of patience.’’— 
“But what could a husband do,’’ said Parla- 
mente, ‘‘save what has been recounted in this 
story ?’’—‘‘What could he do?’’ said Ennarsuite, 
‘the could beat his wife.’ . . . : 
“T think,’’ said Parlamente, ‘‘that a good 
woman would not be so grieved in being beaten 
out of anger, as in being contemptuously treated 
by a man who does not care for her, and after 
having endured the suffering of the loss of his 
friendship, nothing the husband might do would

  cause her much concern. And besides, the story 
says that the trouble she took to draw him back 
to her was beeause of her love for her children, 
and I believe it.’’—-‘‘ And do you think it was so 
very patient of her,’’ said Nomerfide, ‘‘to set fire 
to the bed in which her husband was sleeping?’” 
—‘Yes,’’ said Longarine, ‘‘for when she saw the 
smoke she awoke him; and that was just the thing 
where she was most in fault, for of such husbands 
as those the ashes are good to make lye for the 
washtub.’’—‘‘You are cruel, Longarine,’’ said 
Oisille, ‘‘and you did not live in such fashion with 
your husband.’’-—‘‘No,’’ said Longarine, ‘‘for, 
God be thanked, he never gave me such oceasion, 
but reason to regret him all my life, instead of to 
eomplain of him.’’—‘‘And if he had treated you 
in this way,’’ said Nomerfide, ‘‘what would you 
have done??’—‘‘T loved him so much,’’ said Lon- 
garine, ‘‘that I think I should have killed him 
and then killed myself; for to die after such 
vengeance would be pieasanter to me than to live 
faithfully with a faithless husband.’’ 
“As far as I see,’’ said Hirean, ‘‘you love your 
husbands only for yourselves. If they are good 
after your own heart, you love them well; if they 
commit toward you the least fault in the world, 
they have lost their week’s work by a Saturday, 
The long and the short is that you want to be 
mistresses; for my part I am of your mind, pro- 
vided all the husbands also agree to it.’’—‘‘It is 
reasonable,’’ said Parlamente, ‘‘that the man rule 
us as our head, but not that he desert us or ill- 
treat us.’’—‘‘God,’’ said Oisille, ‘‘has set in such 
due order the man and the woman that if the mar- 
riage estate is not abused, I hold it to be one of

Born in Touraine in 1495, died in Paris in 1558; educated. 
at an abbey and spent fifteen or more years as a monk; 
studied medicine in 1580 and practised in Lyons; traveled 
in Italy; in charge of a parish at Meudon in 1550-52; com- 
posed almanacs and edited old medical books; published 
“Pantagruel” in 1583 and “Gargantua” in 1535, the success 
of which led to several sequels, the last appearing in the 
year of his death.

GARGANTUA IN HIS CHILDHOOD* 
Gargantua, from three years to five, was nour- 
ished and instructed in all proper discipline by 
the commandment of his father, and spent that 
time like the other little children of the country, - 
meat is, in drinking, eating, and sleeping; in eat- 
, Sleeping, and drinking; and in sleeping, drink- 
ink, and eating. Still he wallowed in the mire, 
2¥rom Book I, Chapter XI, of “The Inestimable Life of 
the Great Gargantua, Father of Pantagrucl.” The basis of all 
English translations of Rabelais is the work begun by Sir 
Thomas Urquhart and completed by Peter A. Mottenx. 
Urquhart was a Scotchman, who was born in 1611 and died 
in 1660. Motteux was a Frenchman, who settled in Eng- 
land after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, and was 
the author of several plays. This translation has been called 
“one of the most perfect that ever man accomplished.” Other 
and later versions have usually been based on Urquhart and 
Motteux, but have been expurgated, as is the case with the 
Dassages given here. An earlier version of “Pantagruel,” 
published in London in 1620, was ascribed to “Democritus 
Preudomantio.” .

  blackened his face, trod down his shoes at heel; 
at the flies he did oftentimes yawn, and willingly 
ran after the butterflies, the empire whereof be- 
longed to his father. He sharpened his teeth with 
a slipper, washed his hands with his broth, 
combed his head with a bowl, sat down between 
two stools and came to the ground, covered him- 
self with a wet sack, drank while eating his soup, 
ate his cake without bread, would bite in laugh- 
ing, laugh in biting, hide himself in the water for 
fear of rain, go cross, fall into dumps, look de- 
mure, skin the fox, say the ape’s paternoster, re- 
turn to his skeep, turn the sows into the hay, 
beat the dog before the lion, put the cart before 
the horse, scratch where he did not itch, shoe the 
grasshopper, tickle himself to make himself laugh, 
know flies in milk, serape paper, blur parchment, 
then run away, pull ai the kid’s leather, reckon 
without his host, beat the bushes without catching 
the birds, and thought that bladders were lan- 
terns. He always looked a. gift-horse in. the 
“mouth, hoped to catch larks if ever the heavens 
should fall, and made a virtue of necessity. Every 
morning his father’s puppies ate out of the dish 
with him, and he with them. He would bite their: 
Rabelais, by common consent, has a place among the great~ 
est prose writers of the world. In his knowledge of human — 
nature and his literary excellence, he is often ranked as 
inferior only to Shakespeare. As an exponent of the senti- 
ments and atmosphere of his own time, we find in him what 
is found only in a few of the world's greatest writers. That 
he has not been more widely read in modern times, is at- 
tributed chiefly to the extraordinary coarseness of language 
which he constantly introduces into his pages. This coarse- 
ness is, in fact, so pervasive that expurgation is made ex- 
tremely difficult to any one who would preserve some fair 
remnant of the original,

ears, and they would seratch his nose. The goo 
man Grangousier said to Gargantua’s gever: 
esses: 
‘‘Philip, King of Macedon, knew the wit of hi 
son Alexander, by his skilful managing of 
horse;* for the said horse was se fierce and un 
ruly that none durst adventure to ride him, b 
eause he gave a fall to all his riders, breaking th: 
neck of this man, the leg of that, the brain o: 
one, and the jawbone of another. This ] 
ander being considered, one day in thi 
drome (which was a place appointed for t 
ing and running of horses), he pereeived 
fury of the horse proceeded merely from 
he had of his own shadow; whereupon, getting on 
his back he ran him against the sun, so that the 
shadow fell behind, and by that means tamed 
the horse and brought him to his hand. Whereby 
hig father recognized the divine judgment that 
was in him, and caused him most carefully to be 
instrueted by Aristotle, who at that time was 
highly renowned above all the philosophers of 
Greece. After the same manner I tell you, that 
as regards my son Gargantua, I know that his 
understanding doth participate of some divinity, 
--so keen, subtle, profound, and clear do I find 
him; and if he be well taught, he will attain to a 
sovereign degree of wisdom. Therefore will I 
commit him to some learned man, to have him 
indoctrinated according to his capacity, and will 
- spare no cost.’” 
Whereupon they appointed him a_ great 
sophister-doctor, called Maitre Tubal Holophernes, 
who taught him his A B C so well that he could

  say it by heart backward; and about this he was 
five years arfd three months. Then read he to 
him Donat, Facet, Theodolet, and Alanus in-~ 
parabolis. About this he was thirteen years, six 
months, and two weeks. But you must remark 
that in the mean time he did learn to write in 
Gothic characters, and that he wrote all his books, 
—for the art of printing was not then in use. 
After that he read unto him the book ‘‘De Modis 
Significandi,’’ with the commentaries of Hurtebise, 
of Fasquin, of Tropditeux, of Gaulehaut, of John 
le Veau, of Billonio, of Brelingandus, and a rabble 
of others; and herein he spent more than eighteen 
years and eleven months, and was so well versed 
in it that at the examination he would recite it 
by heart backward, and did sometimes prove on 
his fingers to his mother quod de modis significandi 
non erat scientia. Then did he read to him the 
“Compost,’’ on which he spent sixteen years and 
two months, and that justly at the time his said 
preceptor died, which was in the year one thou- 
sand four hundred and twenty. 
Afterward he got another old fellow with a cough 
to teach him, named Maitre Jobelin Bridé, who 
read unto him Hugutio, Hebrard’s ‘‘Grécisme,’’ 
the ‘‘Doetrinal,’’ the ‘‘Parts,’’ the ‘‘Quid Est,’” 
the ‘‘Supplementum’’; Marmoquet ‘‘De Moribus 
in Mensa Servandis’’; Seneca ‘‘De Quatour Vir- 
tutibus Cardinalibus’’; Passavantus ‘‘Cum Com- 
mento’? and ‘‘Dormi Securé,’’ for the holidays; 
and some other of such-like stuff, by reading 
whereof he became as wise as any we have ever 
baked in an oven. . 
At the last his father perceived that indeed he 
studied hard, and that altho he spent all his time 
61
-P-A-G-E-77
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  in it, he did nevertheless profit nothing, but which 
is worse, grew thereby foolish, simple, doted, and. 
~blockish: whereof making a heavy regret to Don 
Philip des Marays, Viceroy of Papeligose, he 
found that it were better for him to learn 
nothing at all than to be taught such-like books 
under such schoolmasters; because their knowl- 
edge was nothing but brutishness, and their wis- 
dom but toys, bastardizing good and noble spirits” 
and corrupting the flower of youth. ‘‘That it is 
so, take,’’ said he, ‘‘any young boy of the present 
time, who hath only studied two years: if he have 
not a better judgment, a better discourse, and that 
exprest in better terms, than your son, with a 
eompleter carriage and civility to all manner of 
persons, account me forever a chawbacon of La 
Bréne.’’ 
This pleased Grangousier very well, and he eom- 
manded that it should be done. At night at sup- 
per, the said Des Marays brought in a young page 
of his from Ville-gouges, called Eudemon, so well 
combed, so well drest, so well brushed, so sweet 
in his behavior, that he resembled a little angel 
more than a human creature. Then he said to 
Grangousier, ‘‘Do you see this child? He is not 
as yet full twelve years old. Let us try, if it 
pleaseth you, what difference there is betwixt the 
knowledge of the doting dreamers of old time and 
the young lads that are now.’’ 
The trial pleased Grangousier, and he com- 
manded the page to begin. Then Eudemon, ask- 
ing leave of the viceroy, his master, so to do, with 
his cap in his hand, a clear and open countenance, 
ruddy lips, his eyes steady, and his looks fixt upon 
Gargantua, with a youthful modesty, stood up 
62
-P-A-G-E-78
  - FRANCOIS RABELAIS 
  straight on his feet and began to commend and 
magnify him, first, for his virtue and good man- 
ners; seeondly, for his knowledge; thirdly, for, 
his nobility; fourthly, for his bodily beauty; and 
in the fifth place, sweetly exhorted him to rev- 
erence his father with all observancy, who was 
so careful to have. him well brought up. In the 
end he prayed him that he would vouchsafe to 
admit of him amongst the least of his servants; 
for ether favor at: that time desired he none of 
heaven but that he might do him some grateful 
and acceptable service. 
All this was by him delivered with gestures so 
proper, pronunciation so distinct, a voice so elo- 
quent, language so well turned, and in such good 
Latin, that he seemed rather a Graechus, a Ci- 
cero, an Afmilius of the time past than a youth 
of his age. But all the countenance that Gar- 
gantua kept was that he fell to crying like a 
cow, and cast down his face, hiding it with his 
eap; nor could they possibly draw one word 
from him. Whereat his father was so grievously 
vexed that he would have killed Maitre Jobelin; 
but the said Des Marays withheld him from it 
by fair persuasions, so that at length he pacified 
his wrath. The Grangousier commanded he 
should be paid his wages, that they should make 
him drink theologically, after which he was to 
go to all the devils. ‘At least,’’ said he, ‘‘to- 
day shall it not cost his host much, if by chance 
he should die as drunk as an Englishman.’’

GARGANTUA’S EDUCATION ® 
Mairre Jopetin being gone out of the house, 
Grangousier consulted with the viceroy what tu- 
tor they should choose for Gargantua; and it was 
betwixt them resolved that Ponoerates, the tutor 
of Eudemon, should have the charge, and that 
they should all go together to Paris to know what 
was the study of the young men of France at 
that time. . 
‘Ponocrates appointed that for the beginning 
he should do as he had been accustomed; to the 
end he might understand by what means, for 
so long a time, his old masters had made him 
so foolish, simple, and ignorant. He disposed, 
therefore, of his time in such fashion that or- 
dinarily he did awake between eight and nine 
o’clock, whether it was day or not; for so had 
his ancient governors ordained, alleging that 
which David saith, Vanum est vobis ante lucem 
surgere. Then did he tumble and wallow in the 
bed some time, the better to stir up his vital 
spirits, and appareled himself according to the 
season; but willingly he would wear a great long 
- gown of thick frieze, lined with fox fur. After- 
ward he combed his head with the German comb, 
which is the four fingers and the thumb; for 
his preceptors said that to comb himself other-

    wise, to wash and make himself neat was to lose 
time in this world. Then to suppress the dew 
and bad air, he breakfasted on fair fried tripe, 
fair grilled meats, fair hams, fair hashed capen, 
and store of sipped brewis. 
Ponoerates showed him that he ought not to 
eat so soon after rising out of his bed, unless 
he had performed some exercise beforehand. Gar- 
gantua answered: ‘‘What! have not I sufficiently 
well exercised myself? I rolled myself six or 
seven turns in my bed before I rose. Is nos that 
enough? Pope Alexander did so, by the advice 
of a Jew, his physician; and lived till his dying 
day in despite of the envious. My first masters 
have used me to it, saying that breakfast makes 
@ good memory; wherefore they drank first. I 
am very well after it, and dine but the better. 
And Maitre Tubal, who was the first licentiate 
at Paris, told me that it is not everything to 
run a pace, but to set forth well betimes: so 
doth not the total welfare of our humanity de- 
pend upon perpetual drinking atas, atas, like 
ducks, but on drinking well in the morning; 
whence the verse— 
4¢¢Mo rise betimes is no good hour, 
To drink betimes is better sure.’ ’’ 
After he had thoroughly broken his fast, he 
went to church; and they carried for him, in a 
great basket, a huge breviary. There he heard 
six-and-twenty or thirty masses. This while, to 
the same place came his sayer of hours, lapped 
up about the chin like a tufted whoop, and his 
breath perfumed with good store of sirup. With 
him he mumbled all his kyriels, which he so 
ViI—s 65
-P-A-G-E-81
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  euriously picked that there fell not so much as 
one grain to the ground. As he went from the 
church, they brought him, upon a dray drawn 
by oxen, a heap of paternosters of Sanct Claude, 
every one of them being of the bigness of a 
hat-block; and thus walking through the ecloisters, 
galleries, or garden, he said more in turning them 
over than sixteen hermits would have done. Then 
did he study for some paltry half-hour with his 
eyes fixt upon his book; but as the comic saith, 
his mind was in the kitchen. Then he sat down 
at table; and because he was naturally phieg- 
matic, he began his meal with some dozens of 
hams, dried neats’ tongues, mullet’s roe, chitter- 
lings, and such other forerunners of wine. 
In the meanwhile, four of his folks did cast 
into his mouth, one after another continually, 
mustard by whole shovelfuls. Immediately after 
that he drank a horrific draft of white wine for 
the ease of his kidneys. When that was.done, 
he ate aceording to the season meat agreeable 
to his appetite, and then left off eating when 
he was like to erack for fulness. As for his 
drinking, he had neither end nor rule. For he 
was wont to say, that the limits and bounds of 
drinking were when the cork of the shoes of 
him that drinketh swelleth up half a foot high. 
Then heavily mumbling a scurvy grace, he 
washed his hands in fresh wine, picked his teeth 
with the foot of a pig, and talked jovially with 
his attendants. Then the*earpet being spread, 
they brought great store of ecards, dice, and 
chessboards. 
After having well played, reveled, passed and 
spent his time, it was proper to drink a ‘little, 
66
-P-A-G-E-82
  FRANGOIS RABELAIS 
  and that was eleven goblets the man; and im- 
mediately after making good cheer again, he 
would stretch himself upon a fair bench, or a 
good large bed, and there sleep two or three hours 
together without thinking or speaking any hurt. 
After he was awakened he would shake his ears 
a little. In the mean time they brought him fresh 
wine. Then he drank better than ever. Pono- 
erates showed him that it was an ill diet to 
drink so after sleeping. ‘‘It is,’’ answered Gar- 
gantua, ‘‘the very life of the Fathers; for nat- 
uray I sleep salt, and my sleep hath been to 
me instead of so much ham.’’ 
Then began he to study a little, and the pater- 
nosters first, which the better and more formally 
to dispateh, he got up on an old mule which had 
served nine kings; and so mumbling with his 
mouth, doddling his head, would go see a 
coney caught in a net. At his return he went 
into the kitchen to know what roast meat was 
on the spit; and supped very-well, upon my con- 
science, and commonly did invite some of his 
neighbors that were good drinkers; with whom 
carousing, they told stories of all sorts, from the 
old to the new. After supper were brought in 
upon the place the fair wooden gospels—that is 
to say, many pairs of tables and cards—with 
little small banquets, intermined with eollations 
and reer-suppers. Then did he sleep without 
unbridling until eight o’clock in the next morning. 
When Ponocrates knew Gargantua’s vicious 
manner of living, he resolved to bring him up 
in another kind; but for a while he bore with 
him, considering that nature does not endure 
sudden changes without great violence. There- 
67
-P-A-G-E-83

  fore, to begin his work the better, he requested 
a learned physician of that time, called Maitre 
Theodorus, seriously to perpend, if it were pos- 
sible, how to bring Gargantua unto a better 
course. The said physician purged him eanonical- 
ly with Anticyran hellebore, by which medieiné 
he cleansed all the alteration and perverse habi- 
tude of his brain. By this means also Ponocrates 
made him forget all that he had learned under 
his ancient preceptors. To do this better, they 
brought him into the eompany of learned men 
who were there, in emulation of whom a great 
desire and affection came to him to study other- 
wise, and to improve his parts. Afterward he 
put himself into such a train of study that he 
lost not any hour in the day, but employed all 
his time in learning and honest knowledge. Gar- 
gantua awaked then about four o’clock in the 
morning. 
While they were rubbing him, there was read 
unto him some chapter of the Holy. Scripture 
aloud and elearly, with a pronunciation fit for 
the matter; and hereunto was appointed a young 
page born in Basché, named Anagnostes. Ac- 
cording to the purpose and argument of that 
lesson, he oftentimes gave himself to revere, 
adore, pray, and send up his supplieations to 
that good God whose word did show His majesty 
and marvelous judgments. Then his master re- 
peated what had been read, expounding unto 
him the most obseure and difficult points. They 
then considered the face of the sky, if it was 
such as they had observed it the night before, 
and into what signs the sun was entering, as 
also the moon for that day. This done, he was

appareled, combed, curled, trimmed, and per- 
fumed, during which time they repeated to him 
the lessons of the day before. He himself said 
them by heart, and upon them grounded prac- 
tical eases concerning the estate of man; which 
he would prosecute sometimes two or three hours, 
put ordinarily they ceased as soon as he was 
fully clothed. Then for three good hours there 
was reading. This done, they went forth, still 
conferring of the substance of the reading, and 
disported themselves at, ball, tennis, or the pile 
trigone; gallantly exercising their bodies, as be- 
fore they had done their minds. All their play 
was but in liberty, for they left off when they 
pleased; and that was commonly when they did 
sweat, or were otherwise weary. Then were they 
very well dried and rubbed, shifted their shirts, 
and walking soberly, went to see if dinner was 
ready. While they stayed for that, they did 
clearly and eloquently reeite some sentences that 
they had retained of the lecture. 
Tn the mean time Master Appetite came, and 
then very orderly sat they down at table. At 
the beginning of the meal there was read some 
pleasant history of ancient prowess, until he 
had taken his wine. Then if they thought good, 
they continued reading, or began to discourse 
merrily together; speaking first of the virtue, 
propriety, efficacy, and nature of all that was 
served in at that table; of bread, of wine, of 
water, of salt, of flesh, fish, fruits, herbs, roots, 
and of their dressing. By means whereof, he 
learned in a little time all the passages that on 
these subject are to be found in Pliny, Athenzus, 
Dioscorides, Julius Pollux, Gallen, Porphyrius, 
69
-P-A-G-E-85

  Oppian, Polybius, Heliodorus, Aristotle, Alian, 
and others. While they talked of these things, 
many times, to be more the certain, they caused 
the very books to be brought to the table; and 
so well and perfectly did he in his memory retain 
the things above said, that in that time there 
was not a physician that knew half so much as 
he did. Afterward they conferred of the lessons 
read in the morning; and ending their repast 
with some conserve of quince, he washed his 
hands and eyes with fair fresh water, and gave 
thanks unto God in some fine canticle, made in 
praise of the divine bounty and munificence. 
This done, they brought in cards, not to play, 
but to learn a thousand pretty tricks and new 
inventions, which were all grounded upon arith- 
metic. By this means he fell in love with that 
numerical science; and every day after dinner 
and supper he passed his time in it as pleasantly 
as he was wont to do at cards and dice: so that 
at last he understood so well both the theory and 
practise thereof, that Tonstal the Englishman, 
who had written very largely of that purpose, 
eonfest that verily im comparison of him he 
understood nothing but double Dutch; and not 
only in that, but in the other mathematical sci- 
ences, as geometry, astronomy, music. For while 
waiting for the digestion of his food, they made 
a thousand joyous instruments and geometrical 
figures, and at the same time practised the as- 
tronomical canons. 
After this they recreated themselves with sing- 
ing musically, in four or five parts, or upon a 
set theme, as it best pleased them. In matter 
of musical instruments, he learned to play the 
70

  lute, the spinet, the harp, the German flute, the 
flute with nine holes, the violin, and the sackbut. 
This hour thus spent, he betook himself to his 
principal study for three hours together, or more, 
as well to repeat his matutinal lectures as to 
proceed in the book wherein he was; as also to 
write handsomely, to draw and form the antique 
and Roman letters. This being done, they went 
out of their house, and with them a young gentle- 
man of Touraine, named Gymnast, who taught 
him the art of riding. 
Changing then his clothes, he mounted on any 
kind of a horse, which he made to bound in the 
air, to jump the diteh, to leap the palisade, and 
to turn sbort in a ring both to'the right and 
jeft hand. There he broke not his lance; for 
it is the greatest foolishness in the world to say, 
I have broken ten lances at tilts or in fight. A 
carpenter can do even as much. But it is a 
glorious and praiseworthy action with one lance 
to break and overthrow ten enemies. Therefore 
with, a sharp, strong, and stiff lance would he 
usually foree a door, pierce a harness, uproot 
a tree, carry away the ring, lift up a saddle, 
with the mail-coat and gantlet. All this he 
did in complete arms from head to foot. He was 
singularly skilful in leaping nimbly from one 
horse to another without putting foot to ground. 
He could likewise from either side, with a lance 
in his hand, leap on horseback without stirrups, 
and rule the horse at his pleasure without a 
bridle; for such things are useful in military 
engagements. Another day he exercised the 
battle-ax, which he so dextrously wielded that 
he was passed knight of arms in the field.

Then tossed he the pike, played with the two- 
handed sword, with the back sword, with the 
Spanish tuck, the dagger, poniard, armed, un- 
armed, with a buckler, with a cloak, with a 
target. Then would he hunt the hart, the roe. 
buck, the bear, the fallow deer, the wild boar, 
the hare, the pheasant, the partridge, and the 
bustard. He played at the great ball, and made 
it bound in the air, both with fist and foot. He 
wrestled, ran, jumped, not at three steps and 
a leap, nor a hopping, nor yet at the German 
jump; ‘‘for,’’? said Gymnast, ‘‘these jumps are 
for the wars altogether unprofitable, and of no 
use’’: but at one leap he would skip over a 
ditch, spring over a hedge, mount six paces upon 
a wall, climb after this fashion up against a 
-window, the height of a lance. 
He did swim in deep waters on his face, on 
his back, sidewise, with all his body, with his 
feet only, with one hand in the air, wherein he 
held a book, crossing thus the breadth of the 
river Seine without wetting, and dragging along 
his cloak with his teeth, as did Julius Cesar; 
then with the help of one hand he entered for- 
cibly into a boat, from whence he cast himself 
again headlong into the water, sounded the 
depths, hollowed the rocks, and plunged into the 
pits and gulfs. Then turned he the boat about, 
governed it, led it swiftly or slowly with the stream 
and against the stream, stopt it in its course, 
guided it with one hand, and with the other laid 
hard about him with a huge great oar, hoisted 
the sail, hied up along the mast by the shrouds, 
ran upon the bulwarks, set the compass, tackled 
the bowlines, and steered the helm. Coming out 
72
-P-A-G-E-88

  of the water, he ran furiously up against a hill, 
and with the same alacrity and swiftness ran 
down again. He climbed up trees like a cat, 
leaped from the one to the other like a squirrel. 
He did pull down the great boughs and branches, 
like another Milo: then with two sharp well- 
steeled daggers, and two tried bodkins, would 
he run up by the wall to the very top of a house 
like a rat; then suddenly come down from the 
top to the bottom, with such an even disposal 
of members that by the fall he would catch no 
harm. 
He did cast the dart, throw the bar, put the 
stone, practise the javelin, the boar-spear or 
partizan, and the halbert. He broke the strongest 
bows in drawing, bended against his breast the 
greatest cross-bows of steel, took his aim by the 
eye with the hand-gun, traversed the cannon; 
shot at the butts, at the pape-gay, before him, 
sidewise, and vehind him, like the Parthians. 
T: uy tied a cable-rope to the top of a high tower, 
by one end whereof hanging near the ground 
he wrought himself with his hands to the very 
top; then came down again so sturdily and firmly 
that you could not on a plain meadow have run 
with more assurance. They set up a great pole 
fixt upon two trees. There would he hang by 
his hands, and with them alone, his feet touching 
at nothing, would go back and fore along the 
aforesaid rope with so great swiftness, that 
hardly could one overtake him with running.

  if any man or woman, entered inte religious or- 
ders, should by chance come within this new 
abbey, all the rooms should be thoroughly washed 
and eleansed through which they had passed. 
And because in other monasteries all is com- 
passed, limited, and regulated by hours, it was 
decreed that in this new structure there should 
be neither clock nor dial, but that according to 
the opportunities, and incident occasions, all their 
works should be disposed of;. ‘‘for,’’ said Gar- 
gantua, ‘‘the greatest loss of time that I know 
is to count the hours. What good comes of it? 
Nor.can there be any greater folly in the world 
than for one to guide and direct his courses by 
the sound of a bell, and not by his own judgment 
and diseretion.’’ 
Item, Because at that time they put no women 
into nunneries but such as were either one-eyed, 
lame, humpbacked, ill-favored, misshapen, foolish, 
senseless, spoiled, or corrupt; nor encloistered 
any men but those that were either sickly, ill- 
bred, clownish, and the trouble of the house: 
(‘‘Apropos,’’ said the monk—‘‘a woman that 
is neither fair nor good, to what use serves she???” 
“To make a nun of,’’ said Gargantua. ‘‘Yes,’’ 
said the monk, ‘‘and to make shirts.’’) 
Therefore, Gargantua said, was it ordained, 
that into this religious order should be admitted 
no women that were not fair, well-featured, and 
of a sweet disposition; nor men ,that were not 
comely, personable, and also of a sweet disposi- 
tion. 
item, Because in the convents of women men 
come not but underhand, privily, and by stealth: 
it was therefore enacted that in this house there 
15
-P-A-G-E-91
ee 
THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  shall be no women in case there be not men, 
nor men in ease there be not women. 
Item, Because both men and women that are 
received into religious orders after the year of 
their novitiates were constrained and forced per- 
petually to stay there all the days of their life: 
it was ordered that all of whatever kind, men 
or women, admitted within this abbey, should 
have full leave to depart with peace and con- 
tentment whensoever it should seem good to them 
so to do. 
Item, For that the religious men and women 
did ordinarily make three vows—to wit, those of 
chastity, poverty, and obedience: it was there- 
fore constituted and appointed that in this con- 
vent they might be honorably married, that they 
might be rich, and live at liberty. In regard 
to the legitimate age, the women were to be 
admitted from ten till fifteen, and the men from 
twelve till eighteen. 
For the fabrie and furniture of the abbey, 
Gargantua caused to be delivered out in ready 
money twenty-seven hundred thousand eight hun- 
dred and one-and-thirty of those long-wooled 
rams; and for every year until the whole work 
was completed he allotted threescore nine thou- 
sand gold crowns, and as many of the seven stars, 
to be charged all upon the receipt of the river 
Dive. For the foundation and maintenance there- 
of he settled in perpetuity three-and-twenty hun- 
dred threescore and nine thousand five hundred 
and fourteen rose nobles, taxes exempted from all 
in landed rents, and payable every year at the 
gate of the abbey; and for this gave them fair 
letters patent.

The building was hexagonal, and in such a 
fashion that in every one of the six corners there 
was built a great round tower, sixty paces in 
diameter, and were all of a like form and big- 
ness. Upon the north side ran the river Loire, 
on the bank whereof was situated the tower called 
Arctic. Going toward the east there was another 
called Caler, the next following Anatole, the next 
Mesembrine, the next Hesperia, and the last 
Criere. Between each two towers was: the spave 
of three hundred and twelve paces. The whole 
edifice was built in six stories, reckoning the 
cellars underground for one. The second was 
vaulted after the fashion of a_basket-handle; 
the rest were coated with Flanders plaster, in 
the form of a lamp foot. It was roofed with 
fine slates of lead, carrying figures of baskets 
and animals; the ridge gilt, together with the 
gutters, which issued without the wall between 
the windows, painted diagonally in gold and 
blue down to the ground, where they ended in 
great canals, which carried away the water below 
the house into the river. 
This same building was a hundred times more 
sumptuous and magnificent than ever was Boni- 
vet; for there were in it nine thousand three 
hundred and two-and-thirty chambers, every one 
whereof had a withdrawing-room, a closet, a 
wardrobe, a chapel, and a passage into a great 
hall. Between every tower, in the midst of 
the said body of building, there was a winding 
stair, whereof the steps were part of. porphyry, 
which is a dark-red marble spotted with white, 
part of Numidian stone, and part of serpentine 
marble; each of those steps being two-and-twenty 
7

  feet in length and three fingers thick, and the 
just number of twelve betwixt every. landing- 
place. On every landing were two fair antique 
arcades where the light came in; and by those 
they went into a cabinet, made even with, and 
of the breadth of the said winding, and they 
mounted above the roof and ended in a pavilion. 
By this winding they entered on every side into 
a great hall, and from the halls into the cham- 
bers. From the Aretie tower unto the Criere 
were fair great libraries in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, 
French, Italian, and Spanish, respectively dis- 
tributed on different stories, according to their 
languages. In the midst there was a wonderful 
winding stair, the entry whereof was without 
the house, in an arch six fathoms broad. It was 
made in such symmetry and largeness that six 
men-at-arms, lance on thigh, might ride abreast 
all up to the very top'of all the palace. From 
the tower Anatole to the Mesembrine were fair 
great galleries, all painted with the ancient 
prowess, histories, and descriptions of the world. 
In the midst thereof there was likewise such an- 
other ascent and gate as we said there was on 
the river-side. 
In the middle of the lower court there was a 
stately fountain of fair alabaster. Upon the top 
thereof stood the three Graces, with horns of 
abundance, and did jet out the water at their 
breasts, mouth, ears, and eyes. The inside of 
the buildings in this lower court stood upon 
great pillars of Cassydonian stone, and porphyry 
in fair ancient arches. Within these were spa- 
cious galleries, long and large, adorned with eu- 
rious pictures—the horns of bucks and unicorns; 
_ 78

  of the rhinoceros and the hippopotamus;. the 
teeth and tusks of elephants, and other things 
well worth the beholding. The lodging of the 
ladies took up all from the tower Arctic unto the 
gate Mesembrine. The men possest the rest. Be- 
fore the said lodging of the ladies, that they 
might have their recreation, between the two 
first towers, on the outside, were placed the tilt- 
yard, the hippodrome, the theater, the swimming- 
bath, with most admirable baths in three stages, 
well furnished with all necessary accommodation, 
and store of myrtle-water. By the river-side was 
the fair garden of. pleasure, and in the midst 
of that a fair labyrinth. Between the two other 
towers were the tennis and fives courts. Toward 
the tower Criere stood the orchard full of all 
fruit-trees, set and ranged in a quincunx. At 
the end of that was the great park, abounding 
with all sort of game. Betwixt the third couple 
of towers were the butts for arquebus, crossbow, 
and arbalist. The stables were beyond the offices, 
and before them stood the falconry, managed 
by faleoners very expert in the art; and it was 
yearly supplied by the Candians, Venetians, Sar- . 
matians, with all sorts of excellent birds, eagles, 
gerfaleons, goshawks, falcons, sparrow-hawks, 
merlins, and other kinds of them, so gentle and 
perfectly weil trained that, flying from the castle 
for their own disport, they would not fail to 
eateh whatever they encountered. The venery 
was a little further off, drawing toward the park. 
All the halls, chambers, and cabinets were hung 
with tapestry of divers sorts, according to the 
seasons of the year. All the pavements were 
covered with green cloth. The beds were em- 
, 79
-P-A-G-E-95
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  broidered. In every back chamber there was 
a looking-glass of pure crystal, set in a frame 
cf fine gold garnished with pearls, and of such 
greatness that it would represent to the full 
the whole person. At the going out of the halls 
belonging to the ladies’ lodgings were the per- 
fumers and hair-dressers, through whose hands 
the gallants passed when they were to visit the 
ladies. These did every morning furnish the 
ladies’ chambers with rose-water, musk, and an- 
gelica; and to each of them gave a little smelling- 
bottle breathing the choicest aromatical scents. 
The ladies on the foundation of this order 
were appareled after their own pleasure and 
liking. But since, of their own free will, they 
were reformed in manner as followeth: 
They wore stockings of scarlet which reached 
just three inches above the knee, having the bor- 
der beautified with embroideries and trimming. 
Their garters were of the color of their bracelets, 
and cireled the knee both over and under. Their 
shoes and slippers were either of red, violet, or 
crimson velvet, cut a barbe d’écrévisse. 
Next to their smock they put on a fair corset 
of pure silk camblet; above that went the pet- 
ticoat of white, red tawny, or gray taffeta. Above 
this was the cotte in cloth of silver, with needle- 
work either (according to the temperature and 
disposition of the weather) of satin, damask, vel- 
vet, orange, tawny, green, ash-colored, blue, yel- 
low, crimson, clath of gold, cloth of silver, or 
some other choice stuff, according to the day. 
Their gowns, correspondent to the season, were 
either of cloth of gold with silver edging, of red 
satin covered with gold purl, of taffeta, white, 
80
-P-A-G-E-96
  
FRANCOIS RABELAIS 
  blue, black, or tawny, of silk serge, silk camblet, 
velvet, cloth of silver, silver tissue, cloth of gold, 
or figured satin with golden threads. 
In the summer, some days, instead of gowns, 
they wore fair mantles of the above-named stuff, 
or capes of violet. velvet with edging of gold, 
or with knotted cordwork of .gold embroidery, 
garnished with little Indian pearls. They always 
carried a fair plume of feathers, of the color of 
their muff, bravely adorned with spangles of 
gold. In the winter-time they had their taffeta 
gowns of all colors, as above named, and those 
lined with the rich furrings of wolves, weasels, 
Calabrian martlet, sables, and other costly furs. 
Their beads, rings, bracelets, and collars were 
of precious stones, such as carbuneles, rubies, 
diamonds, sapphires, emerald, turquoises, gar- 
nets, agates, beryls, and pearls. 
Their head-dressing varied with the season 
of the year. In winter it was of the French 
fashion; in the spring of the Spanish; in summer 
of the fashion of Tuscany, except only upon the 
holidays and Sundays, at which times they were 
accoutered in the French mode, because they ac- 
counted it more honorable, better befitting the 
modesty of a matron. 
The men were appareled after their fashion. 
Their stockings were of worsted or of serge, of 
white, black, or scarlet. Their breeches were of 
velvet, of. the same color with their stockings, 
or very near, embroidered and cut according to 
their fancy. Their doublet was of cloth of gold, 
eloth of silver, velvct, satin, damask, or taffeta, 
of the same colors, cut embroidered, and trimmed 
up in the same manner. The points were of 
VII—s - 81
-P-A-G-E-97
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  silk of the same colors, the tags were of gold 
enameled. Their coats and jerkins were of cloth 
of gold, cloth of silver, gold tissue, or velvet 
embroidered, as they thought fit. Their gowns 
were every whit as costly as those of the ladies. 
Their girdles were of silk, of the color of their 
doublets, Every one had a gallant sword by his 
side, the hilt and handle whereof were gilt, and 
the scabbard of velvet, of the color of his 
breeches, the end in gold, and goldsmith’s work. 
The dagger of the same. Their caps were of 
black velvet, adorned with jewels and buttons 
of gold. Upon that they wore a white plume, 
most prettily and minion-like parted by so many 
rows of gold spangles, at the end whereof hung 
dangling fair rubies, emeralds, ete. 
But so great was the sympathy between the 
gallants and the ladies, that every day they were 
appareled in the same livery. And that they 
might not miss, there were certain gentlemen 
appointed to tell the youths every morning what 
colors the ladies would on that day wear; for 
all was done according to the pleasnre of the 
ladies. In these so handsome clothes, and habili- 
ments-so rich, think not that either one or other 
of either sex did waste any time at all; for the 
masters of the wardrobes had all their raiments 
and apparel so ready for every morning, and 
the chamber-ladies were so well skilled, that in 
a trice they would be drest, and completely in 
their clothes front head to foot. And to have 
these aceouterments with the more conveniency, 
there was about the wood of Thelema a row of 
houses half a league long, very neat and cleanly, 
wherein dwelt the goldsmiths, lapidaries, em- 
82
-P-A-G-E-98
  FRANGOIS RABELAIS 
  
broiderers, tailors, gold-drawers, velvet-weavers, 
tapestry-makers, and upholsterers, who wrought 
there every one in his own trade, and all for the 
aforesaid friars and nuns. They were furnished 
with matter and stuff from the hands of Lord 
Nausiclete, who every year brought them seven 
ships from the Perlas and Cannibal Islands, laden 
with ingots of gold, with raw silk, with pearls 
and precious stones. And if any pearls began 
to grow old, and lose somewhat of their natural 
whiteness and luster, those by their art they did 
renew by tendering them to cocks to be eaten, 
as they used to give casting unto hawks. 
All their life was spent not in laws, statutes, 
or rules, but according to their own free will and 
pleasure. They rose out of their beds when they 
thought good; they did eat, drink, labor, sleep, 
when they had a mind to it, and were disposed 
for it. None did awake them, none did constrain 
them to eat, drink, nor do any other thing; for so 
had Gargantua established it. In all their rule, 
and strietest tie of their order, there was but 
this one clause to be observed: Fay ce que 
vouldras. 
Because men that are free, well born, well 
bred, and conversant in honest companies, have 
naturally an instinct and spur that prompteth 
them unto virtuous actions and withdraws them 
from vice, which is called honor. Those same 
men, when by base subjection and constraint 
they are brought under and kept down, turn 
aside from that noble disposition by which they 
formerly were inclined to virtue, to shake off the 
bond of servitude; for it is agreeable with the 
nature of man to long after things forbidden.

into English by Thomas Norton and published in 1561. 
An abridgment, translated by Christopher Fetherstone, was 
published in Edinburgh in 1585, and another abridgment

JOHN CALVIN 
  In this upright state, man possest freedom of will, 
by which if he chose he was able to obtain eternal 
life. 
It were here unseasonable to introduce the 
question concerning the secret predestination of 
God, because we are not considering what might 
or might not happen, but what the nature of man 
truly was. Adam, therefore, might have stood if 
he chose, sinee it was only by his own will that 
he fell; but it was because his will was pliable 
in either direction, and he had not received con- 
staney to persevere, that he so easily fell. Still 
he had a free choice of good and evil; and not 
only so, but in the mind and will there was the 
highest rectitude, and all the organic parts were 
duly framed to obedience, until man corrupted its 
good properties, and destroyed himself. Hence 
the great darkness of philosophers who have 
looked for a complete building in a ruin, and fit 
arrangement in disorder. The principle they set 
out with was, that man could not be a rational 
animal unless he had a free choice of good and 
evil. They also imagined that the distinction be- 
tween virtue and vice was destroyed, if man did 
not of his own counsel arrange his life. So far 
well, had there been no change in man. , This 
being unknown to them, it is not surprizing that 
they throw everything into confusion. But those 
who, while they profess to be the disciples of 
Christ, still seek for free-will in man, notwith- 
standing of his being lost and drowned in. spiri- 
tual destruction, labor under manifold delusion, 
making a heterogeneous mixture of inspired doe- 
trine and philosophical opinions, and so erring as 
to both.

But it will be better to leave these things to 
their own place. At present it is necessary only 
to remember that man at his first creation was 
very different from all his posterity; who, de- 
riving their origin from him after he was cor- 
rupted, received a hereditary taint. At first every 
part of the soul was formed to rectitude. There 
was soundness of mind and freedom of will to 
choose the good. If any one objects that it was 
placed, as it were, in a slippery position because 
its power was weak, I answer, that the degree 
conferred was sufficient to take away every ex- 
cuse. For surely the Deity could not be tied down 
to this condition,—to make man such that he 
either could not or would not sin. Such a nature 
might have been more excellent; but to expostu- 
late with God as if he had been bound to confer 
this nature on man, is more than unjust, seeing 
he had full right to determine how much or how 
little he would give. Why he did not sustain him 
by the virtue of perseverance is hidden in his 
counsel; it is ours to keep within the bounds of 
soberness. Man had received the power, if he had 
the will, but he had not the will which would 
have given the power; for this will would have 
been followed by perseverance. Still, after he 
had received so much, there is no excuse for his 
having spontaneously brought death upon himse7f. 
No necessity was laid. upon God to give him more 
than that intermediate and even transient will, 
that out of man’s fall he might extract materials 
for his own glory.

JOACHIM DU BELLAY 
Born about 1524, died in 1560; surnamed “The French 
Ovid” and ‘The Apollo of the Pléiade”; noted as poet and 
prose writer; a cousin of Cardinal du Bellay and for a time 
his secretary; wrote forty-seven sonnets on the antiquities of 
Rome; his most notable work in prose is his “Défense et 
Tlustration de la Langue Frangoise.” 
WHY OLD FRENCH WAS NOT AS RICH AS 
GREEK AND LATIN* 
Ir our language is not as copious or rich as the 
Greek or Latin, this must not be laid to their 
charge, assuming that our language is not capable 
in itself of being barren and sterile; but it should 
rather be attributed to the ignorance of our an- 
cestors, who, having (as some one says, speaking 
of the ancient Romans) held good doing in 
greater estimation than good talking and pre- 
ferred to leave to their posterity examples of 
virtue rather than precepts, have deprived them- 
selves of the glory of their great deeds, and us 
1 From the “Défence et. Illustration de la Langue Fran- 
goise.” Translated for this collection by Eric Arthur Bell. 
Du Bellay belonged to a group of sixteenth-century writers 
known as the Pléiade, who took upon themselves the mission 
of reducing the French language, in its literary forms, to 
something comparable to Greek and Latin. Mr. Saintsbury 
says they ‘made modern French—-made it, we may gay, twice 
over”; by which he means that French, in their time, was 
revolutionized, and that, in the Romantic movement of 1830, 
Hugo and his associates were armed by the work of the 
Pléiade for their revolt against the restraints of rule and 
language that had been imposed by the eighteenth century.

of their imitation; and by the same means have 
left our tongue so poor and bare that it has need 
of ornament and (if we may be allowed the 
phrase) of borrowed plumage. 
But who is willing to admit that the Greek and 
Roman tongues have always possest that ex- 
cellence which characterized them at the time of 
Homer, Demosthenes, Virgil, and Cicero? And if 
these authors were of the opinion that a little 
diligence and culture were incapable of producing 
greater fruit, why did they make such efforts to 
bring it to the pitch of perfection it is in to-day? 
I can say the same thing of our language, which 
is now beginning to bloom without bearing fruit, 
like a plant which has not yet flowered, waiting 
till it can produce all the fruit possible. This is 
certainly not the fault of nature who has rendered 
it more sterile than the others, but the fault of 
those who have tended it, and have not cultivated 
it sufficiently. Like a wild plant which grows in 
the desert, without ever being watered or pruned 
or protected by the trees and shrubs which give it 
shade, it fades and almost dies. 
Tf the ancient Romans had been so negligent of 
the culture of their language when first they began 
to develop it, it is certain that they could not 
have become so great in so short a time. But 
they, in the guise of good agriculturists, first of 
all transplanted it from a wild locality to a culti- 
vated one, and then in order that it might bear 
fruit earlier and better, cut away several useless 
shoots and substituted exotic and domestic ones, 
mostly drawn from the Greek language, which 
have grafted so well on to the trunk that they 
appear no longer adopted but natural. Out of

  these have sprang, from the Latin tongue, flowers 
and colored fruits in great number and of much 
eloquence, all of which things, not so much from 
its own nature but artificially, every tongue is 
wont to produce. And if the Greeks and Romans, 
more diligent in the culture of their tongue than 
we are in ours, found an eloquence in their lan- 
guage only after much labor and industry, are we 
for this reason, even if our vernacular is not as 
rich as it might be, to condemn it as something 
vile and of little value? 
The time will come perhaps, and I hope it will 
be for the good of the French, when the language 
of this noble and powerful kingdom (unless with 
France the whole French language is to be 
buried),” which is already beginning to throw out 
its roots, will shoot ont of the grourid and rise 
to such a height and size that it will even emulate 
that of the Greeks and the Romans, producing 
like them, Homers, Demostheneses, Virgils, and 
Ciceros, in the same way that France has already 
produced her Pericles, Alcibiades, Themistocles, 
and Scipio. 
2Du Bellay here refers to the unhappy political state of 
France during his short tife of thirty-six years. He was born 
one year before the defest of Francis I at Pavia. When 
twenty years old, Henry VIII in league with Charles V had 
invaded France. Fourteen years later the country was dis- 
tracted by disastrous religious wars which led up to the mas- 
sacre of St. Bartholomew a few years after his death.

come down to us very much as Chaucer has come down in

OF SOCIETY AND SOLITUDE? 
THERE are some particular natures that are 
private and retired: my natural way is proper for 
communication, and apt to lay me open; I am all 
without and in sight, born for society and friend- 
ship. The solitude that I love myself and recom- 
mend to others, is chiefly no other than to with- 
draw my thoughts and affections into myself; to 
restrain and check, not my steps, but my own 
cares and desires, resigning all foreign solicitude, 
and mortally avoiding servitude and obligation, 
and not so much the crowd of men, as the crowd 
of business. -Local solitude, to say the truth, 
rather gives me more room, and sets me more at 
large; I more readily throw myself upon the 
affairs of state and the world, when I am alone; 
at the Louvre, and in the bustle of the court, I 
fold myself within my own skin; the crowd 
thrusts me upon myself; and I never entertain 
myself so wantonly, with so much license, or so 
especially, as in places of respect and ceremonious 
prudence: our follies do not make me laugh, but 
our wisdom does. I am naturally no enemy to a 
eourt life; I have therein passed a good part of 
my own, and am of a humor cheerfully to fre- 
quent great company, provided it be by intervals 
and at my own time: but this softness of judg-

  ment whereof I speak, ties me perforce to soli- 
tade. Even at home, amidst a numerous family, 
and in a house sufficiently frequented, I see people 
enough, but rarely such with whom I delight to 
converse; and I there reserve both for myself 
and others an unusual liberty: there is in my 
house no such thing as ceremony, ushering, or 
waiting upon people down to the coach, and such 
other troublesome ceremonies as our courtesy en- 
joins (O servile and importunate eustom!) Every 
one there governs himself according to his own 
method; let who will speak his thoughts, I sit 
mute, meditating and shut up in my closet, with- 
out any offense to my guests. 
The men, whose society and familiarity I covet, 
are those they call sincere and able men; and the 
image of these makes me disrelish the rest. It is, 
if rightly taken, the rarest of our forms, and a 
form that we chiefly owe to nature. The end of 
this commerce is simply privacy, frequentation and 
conference, the exercise of souls, without other 
fruit. In our discourse, all subjects are alike to 
me; let there be neither weight, nor depth, ’tis all 
one: there is yet grace and pertinency; all there 
is tinted with a mature and constant judgment, 
and mixt with goodness, freedom, gatety, and 
friendship. ’Tis not only in talking of the affairs 
of kings and state, that our wits discover their 
force and beauty, but every whit as much in pri- 
vate conferences. I understand my men even by 
their silence and smiles; and better discover them, 
perhaps, at table, than in the council. Hippo- 
machus said very well, ‘‘that he could know the 
good wrestlers by only seeing them walk in the

to them for want of other more real, natural,

pitied, who has his cure in his sleeve.’? In the 
experience and practise of this maxim, which is 
a very true one, consists all the benefit I reap 
from books; and yet I make as little use of 
them, almost, as those who know them not: I 
enjoy them as a miser does his money, in knowing 
that I may enjoy them when I please: my. mind 
is satisfied with this right of possession. I never 
travel without books, either in peace or war; and 
yet sometimes I pass over several days, and some- 
times months, without looking on them: I will 
read by and by, say I to myself, or to-morrow, 
or when I please; and in the interim, time steals 
away without any inconvenience. For it is not 
to be imagined to what degree I please myself 
and rest content in this consideration, that I have 
them by me to divert myself with them when I 
am disposed, and to eall to mind what a refresh- 
ment they are to my life. "Tis the best viatieum

  other sort of diversion, how light soever, because 
this can never fail me. 
When at home, I a little more frequent my 
library, whence I overlook at once all the con- 
eerns of my family. ‘Tis situated at the entrance 
into my house, and I thence see under me my 
garden, court, and base-court, and almost all parts 
of the building. There I turn over now one book, 
and then another, on various subjects without 
method or design. One while I meditate, another 
I record and dictate, as I walk to and fro, such 
whimsies as these I present to you here. "Tis in 
the third story of a tower, of which the ground 
room is my chapel, the second story a chamber 
with a withdrawing-room and closet, where I 
often lie, to be more retired; and above is a great 
wardrobe. This formerly was the most useless 
part of the house. I there pass away both most 
of the days of my life and most of the hours of 
those days. In the night I am never there. There 
is by the side of it a cabinet handsome enough, 
with a fireplace very commodiously contrived, and 
plenty of light: and were I not more afraid of 
the trouble than the expense—the trouble that 
frights me from all business, I could very easily 
adjoin on either side, and on the same floor, a 
gallery of an hundred paces long, and twelve 
broad, having found walls already raised for some 
other design, to the requisite height. 
Every place of retirement requires a walk: my 
thoughts sleep if I sit still; my fancy does not 
go by itself, as when my legs move it: and all 
those who study without a book are in the same

ing parts of the circle present me a view of all 
my books at once, ranged upon five rows of 
shelves around about me. It has three noble and 
free prospects, and is sixteen paces in diameter. 
I am not so continually there in winter; for my 
house is built upon an eminence, as its name im- 
ports, and no part of it is so much exposed to the 
wind and weather as this, whieh pleases me the 
better, as being of more difficult access and a 
little remote, as well upon the account of exercise, 
as also being there more retired from the crowd. 
"Tis there that I am in my kingdom, and there I 
endeavor to make myself an absolute monarch, 
and to sequester this one corner from all society, 
conjugal, filial, and civil; elsewhere I have but 
verbal authority only, and of a confused essence. 
That man, in my opinion, is very miserable, who 
has not a home where to be by himself, where to 
entertain himself alone, or to conceal himself 
from others. Ambition sufficiently plagues her 
proselytes, by keeping them always in show, like 
the statue of a public square: ‘‘Magna servitus 
est magna fortuna.’’? They can not so much as 
be private in the water-closet. I have thought 
nothing so severe in the austerity of life that 
our monks affect, as what I have observed in 
some of their communities; namely, by rule to 
have a perpetual society of place, and numerous 
persons present in every action whatever; and 
think it much more supportable to be always 
alone, than never to be so. 
If any one shall tell me that it is to under- 
value the muses, to make use of them only for 
sport and to pass away the time, I shall tell him,

  that he does not know, so well as I, the value 
of the sport, the pleasure, and the pastime; I can 
hardly forbear to add that all other end is 
ridiculous. I live from hand to mouth, and, with 
reverenee be it spoken, I only live for myself; 
there all my designs terminate. I studied, when 
young, for ostentation; since, to make myself a 
little wiser; and now for my diversion, but never 
for any profit. A vain and prodigal humor I had 
after this sort of furniture, not only for the 
supplying my own need, but, moreover, for orna- 
ment and outward show, I have since quite cured 
tayself of. 
Books have many charming qualities to such 
as know how to choose them; but every good has 
its ill; ’tis.a pleasure that is not pure and clean, 
no more than others: it has its inconveniences, 
and great ones too. The soul indeed is exercised 
therein; but the body, the care of which I must 
withal never neglect, remains in the mean time 
without action, and grows heavy and somber. I 
know no excess more prejudicial to me, nor more 
to be avoided in this my declining age.

THAT THE SOUL DISCHARGES HER PAS- 
SIONS UPON FALSE OBJECTS WHERE TRUE ONES ARE WANTING‘ 
A GenTiemMan of my country, who was very 
often tormented with the gout, being importun’d 
by his physicians totally to reclaim his appetite 
from all manner of salt meats, was wont pres-~ 
ently to reply that he must needs have something, 
to quarrel with in the extremity of his fits, and 
that he fancy’d that railing at and cursing one 
while the Bologna sausages, and another the 
dry’d tongues and the hams, was some mitigation 
to his pain. And in good earnest, as the arm 
when it is advanced to strike, if it fail of meeting 
with that upon which it was design’d to discharge 
the blow, and spends itself in vain, does offend 
the striker himself; and as also, that to make a 
pleasant prospect the sight should not be lost 
and dilated in a vast extent of empty air, but 
have some bounds to limit and cireumseribe it at 
a reasonable distance: 
*¢Ag winds do lose their strength, unless with- 
stood 
By some dark grove of strong opposing 
wood.’’

and discompos’d, turns its violence upon itself,

their hair. *Tis the common practise of affliction. 
And the philosopher Bion said pleasantly of the 
king, who by handfuls pull’d his hair off his head 
for sorrow, ‘‘Does this man think that baldness 
is a remedy for grief?’’ Who has not seen 
peevish gamesters worry the cards with their teeth, 
and swallow whole bales of dice in revenge for 
the loss of their money? Xerxes whipt the sea, 
and wrete a challenge to Mount Athos; Cyrus em- 
ploy’d a whole army several days at work, to re- 
venge himself of the river Gnidus, for the fright 
it had put him into in passing over; and Caligula 
demolish’d a very beautiful palace for the 
pleasure his mother had once enjoy’d there. I 
remember there was a story current, when I was 
a boy, that one of our neighboring kings, having 
receiv’d a blow from the hand of God, swore he 
would be reveng’d, and in order to it, made proc- 
Jamation that for ten years to come no one 
should pray to him, or so much as mention him 
thronghout his dominions; by which we are not 
so much to take measure of the folly, as the vain- 
glory of the nation of which this tale was told. 
They are vices that, indeed, always go together; 
but such actions as these have in them more of 
presumption than want of wit. Augustus Cesar,

which being presently reported to Cyrus, and he 
sending to inquire what it meant, Crwsus gave 
him to understand that he now found the ad- 
vertisement Solon had formerly given him true 
to his cost, which was, ‘‘That men, however for- 
tune may smile upon them, could never be said

the last day of their lives, by reason of the un- 
certainty and mutability of human things, which 
upon very light and trivial oceasions are subject 
to be totally chang’d into a quite contrary eon- 
dition.’”- 
And therefore it was, that Agesilaus made 
answer to one that was saying, ‘‘What a happy 
young man the King of Persia was to come so 
young to so mighty a kingdom.’’ ‘‘’Tis true 
{said he], but neither was Priam unhappy at his 
years.’’ In a short time, of kings of Macedon, 
successors to that mighty Alexander, were made 
joyners and scriveners at Rome; of a tyrant of 
Sicily, a pedant at Corinth; of a conqueror of 
one-half of the world, and general of so many 
armies, a miserable suppliant to the raseally 
officers of a king of Egypt. So much the pro- 
longation of five or six months of life cost the 
great and noble Pompey, and no longer since than 
our fathers’ days, Ludovico Sforza, the tenth duke 
of Milan, whom all Italy had so long truckled 
under, was seen to die a wretched prisoner at 
Loches, but not till he had lived ten years in 
captivity, which was the worst part of his for- 
tune. The fairest of all queens (Mary, Queen 
of Scots), widow to the greatest king in Europe,’ 
did she not come to die by the hand of an ex- 
ecutioner? Unworthy and barbarous cruelty! and 
a thousand more examples there are of the same 
kind; for it seems that as storms and tempests

fortune stand for nothing, either to the making

  even to perfection. There are brave, and for- 
tunate deaths. I have seen death eut the thread 
of the progress of a predigious advancement, and 
in the height and flower of its increase of a cer- 
tain person, with so glorious an end, that in my 
opinion his ambitious and generous designs had 
nothing in them so high and great as their inter- 
ruption; and he arrived without completing his 
course, at the place to which his ambition pre- 
tended with greater glory than he could himself 
either hope or desire, and anticipated by his fall 
the name and power to which he aspir’d, by per- 
feeting his career. In the judgment I make of 
another man’s life, I always observe how he car- 
ried himself at his death; and the principal con- 
cern I have for my own is that I may die hand- 
somely;.that is, patiently and without noise.

OF MATERIAL THINGS AND OF THE 
EXISTENCE OF GOD* 
SzveraL questions remain for consideration 
respecting the attributes of God and my own 
nature or mind. I will, however, on some other 
oceasion perhaps resume the investigation of 
these.’ Meanwhile, as I have discovered what must 
be done and what avoided to arrive at the knowl- 
edge of truth, what I have chiefly to do is to 
essay to emerge from the state of doubt in which 
I have for some time been, and to discover 
whether anything can be known with certainty 
regarding material objects. But before consider- 
ing whether such objects as I conceive exist with- 
out me, I must examine their ideas in so far as 
these are to be found in my consciousness, and 
discover which of them are distinct and which 
confused. 
1 From the “Meditations,” translated by John Veitch.

  In the first place, I distinctly imagine that 
quantity which the philosophers commonly call 
continuous, or the extension in length, breadth, 
and depth that is in this quantity, or rather in 
the object to which it is attributed. Further, I 
can enumerate in it many diverse parts, and 
attribute to each of these all sorts of sizes, figures, 
situations, and local motions; and, in fine, I can 
assign to each of these motions ali degrees of 
duration. And I not only distinctly know these 
things when I thus consider them in general; but 
besides, by a little attention, I discover innumer- 
able particulars respecting figures, numbers, mo- 
tion, and the like, which are so evidently true, 
and so accordant with my nature, that when J 
now discover them I do not so.much appear to 
learn anything new as to call to remembrance 
what I before knew, or for the first time to re- 
mark what was before in my mind, but to which 
I had not hitherto directed my attention. And 
what I here find of most importance is, that I 
discover in my mind innumerable ideas of eertain 
objects, which can not be esteemed pure nega- 
tions, altho perhaps they possess no reality be- 
yond my thought, and which are not framed by 
me, tho it may be in my power to think, or not 
to think them, but possess true and immutable 
natures of their own. 
As, for example, when I imagine a triangle, 
altho there is not perhaps and never was in any 
place in the universe apart from my thought one 
such figure, it remains true, nevertheless, that this 
figure possesses a certain determinate nature, 
form, or essence, which is immutable and eternal, 
and not framed by me, nor in any degree de- 
108
-P-A-G-E-124
TT 
RENE DESCARTES —— 
pendent on my thought; as appears from the cir- 
cumstance, that diverse properties of the triangle 
may be demonstrated, viz. that its three angles 
are equal to two right, that its greatest side is 
subtended by its greatest angle, and the like, 
which, whether I will or not, I now clearly discern 
to belong to it, altho before I did not at all think 
of them, when, for the first time, I imagined a 
triangle, and which accordingly can not be said 
to have been invented by me. 
Nor is it a valid objection to allege that per- 
haps this idea of a triangle came into my mind 
by the medium of the senses, through my having 
seen bodies of a triangular figure; for I am able 
to form in thought an innumerable variety of fig- 
ures with regard to which it can not be supposed 
that they were ever objects of serse, and I can 
nevertheless demonstrate diverse properties of 
their nature no less than of the triangle, all of 
which are assuredly true since I clearly conceive 
them: and they are therefore something, and not 
mere negations; for it is highly evident that all 
that is true is something (truth being identical 
with existence); and I have already fully shown 
the truth of the principle, that whatever is clearly 
and distinctly known is true. And altho this had 
not been demonstrated, yet the nature of my mind - 
is such as to compel me to assent to what I clearly 
conceive while I so conceive it; and I recollect 
that even when J still strongly adhered to the 
objects of sense, I reckoned among the number 
of the most certain truths those I clearly con- 
ceived relating to figures, numbers, and other mat- 
ters that pertain to arithmetic and geometry, and 
in general to the pure mathematics. 
109
-P-A-G-E-125

  But now if because I can draw from my thought 
the idea of an object it follows that all I clearly 
and distinetly apprehend to pertain to this object 
does in truth belong to it, may I not from this 
derive an argument for the existence of God? It 
is certain that I no less find the idea of a God 
in my consciousness, that is, the idea of a being 
supremely perfect, than that of any figure or 
number whatever: and I know with not less 
clearness and distinctness that an (actual and 
eternal) existence pertains to his nature than that 
all which is demonstrable of any figure or number 
really belongs to the nature of that figure or num- 
ber; and, therefore, altho all the conclusions of 
the preceding ‘‘Meditations’’ were false, the ex- 
istence of God would pass with me for a truth 
at least as certain as I ever judged any truth of 
mathematics to be, altho indeed such a doctrine 
may at first sight appear to contain more 
sophistry than truth. For, as I have been ae- 
eustomed in every other matter to distinguish be- 
tween existence and essence, I easily believe that 
the existence can be separated from the essence 
of God, and that thus God may be conceived as 
not actually existing. But, nevertheless, when I 
think of it more attentively, it appears that the 
existence can no more be separated from the es- 
sence of God than the idea of a mountain from 
that of a valley, or the equality of its three angles 
to two right angles, from the essence of a 
(rectilineal) triangle; so that it is not less im- 
possible to conceive a God, that is, a being su- 
premely perfect, to whom existence is wanting, 
or who is devoid of a certain perfection, than to 
coneeive a mountain without a valley.

  But tho, in truth, I can not conceive a God un- 
less as existing, any more than I can a mountain 
without a valley, yet, just as it does not follow 
that there is any mountain in the world merely 
because I conceive a mountain with a valley, so 
likewise, tho I conceive God as existing, it does 
not seem to follow on that account that God ex- 
ists; for my thought imposes no necessity on 
things; and as I may imagine a winged horse, tho 
there be none sueh, so I could perbaps attribute 
existence to God, tho no God existed. But the 
cases are not analogous, and a fallacy lurks under 
the semblance of this objection: for because I 
can not conceive a mountain without a valley, it 
does not follow that there is any mountain or 
valley in existence, but simply that the mountain 
or valley, whether they do or do not exist, are in- 
separable from each other; whereas, on the other 
hand, beeavise I can not conceive God unless as 
existing, it follows that existence is inseparable 
from Him, and therefore that He really exists: not 
that this is brought about by my thought, or that 
it imposes any necessity on things, but, on the 
contrary, the necessity which lies in the thing 
itself, that is, the necessity of the existence of 
God, determines me to think in this way: for it 
is not in my power to conceive a God without ex- 
istenee, that is, a being supremely perfect, and 
yet devoid of an absolute perfection, as I am free 
to imagine a horse with or without wings.

Tue contempt of riches in philosophers was 
only a hidden desire to avenge their merit upon 
the injustice of fortune, by despising the very 
goods of which fortune had deprived them; it was 
a secret to guard themselves against the degrada-

There is no disguise which can long hide love 
where it exists, nor feign it where it does not.

Almost all the world takes pleasure in paying 
small debts; many people show gratitude for 
trifling, but there is hardly one who does not, 
show ingratitude for great favors. 
Nothing is rarer than true good nature; those 
who think they have it are generally only pliant.

There is no less eloquence in the voice, in the 
eyes and in the air o2 a speaker than in his choice

True eloquence consists in saying all that

There are people whose faults become them, 
others whose very virtues disgrace them. 
We are never so happy or so unhappy as we

Our enemies come nearer the truth in the 
opinions they form of us than we do in our

Whatever difference there appears in our for- 
tunes, there is nevertheless a certain compensa-

What we term virtue is often but a mass of 
various actions and divers interests, which for- 
tune, or our own industry, manage to arrange; 
and it is not always from valor or from chastity 
that men are brave, and women chaste. 
Most men expose themselves in battle enough

In the intercourse of life, we please more b 
our faults than by our good qualities. 
We are easily consoled at the misfortunes o 
our friends when they enable us to prove o

He is a truly good man who desires alway:

We frequently do good to enable us with im-

He is really wise who is nettled at nothing. 
Hypocrisy is the homage vice pays to virtue.” 
In the adversity of our best friends we always 
find something which is not wholly displeasing 
to us." 
2A maxim similar to this has been found in the writings of 
other men. Thus Massillon, in one of his sermons, said, ‘“Vice 
pays homage to virtue in doing honor to her appearance’’ ; 
and Junius, writing to the Duke of Grafton, said, ‘You have 
done as much mischief to the community as Machiavel, if 
Machiavel had not known that an appearance of morals and 
religion are useful in society.” Both, however, lived in a 
period subsequent to that in which La Rochefoucauld wrote. 
.%This. maxim, which more than any other has caused 
La Rochefoucauld to be criticized severely as a cynic, if not 
a misanthrope, appeared only in the first two editions of the 
book. In the others, published in the author’s lifetime, it 
was supprest. In defense of the author, it has been main- 
tained that what he meant by the saying was that the 
pleasure derived from a friend’s misfortunes has its origin 
in the opportunity thus afforded to give him help. The 
reader should compare this saying with another that is im- 
eluded in these selectidns, “We are easily consoled at the 
misfortunes of our friends when they enable us to prove our 
tenderness for them.”

happy; nothing can make a fool content; that is

OF THE PREVALENCE OF SELF-LOVE* 
Sexr is hateful. You, Milton, conceal self, but 
do not thereby destroy it; therefore you are still 
hateful. Not so, for in acting as we do, to oblige 
everybody, we give no reason for hating us. 
True, if we only hated in self the vexation which 
it causes us. But it I hate it because it is un- 
just, and because it makes itself the center of all, 
I shall always hate it. 
In one word, Self has two qualities: it is unjust 
in its essence, because it makes itself the center 
of all; it is inconvenient to others, in that it 
would ‘bring them into subjection, for each ‘‘I’? 
is the enemy, and would fain be the tyrant of all 
1From the ‘Thoughts.” Many translations have been 
made of Pascal's ‘‘Thonghts”—one in 1680 by J. Walker, 
one in 1704 by Basil Kennet, one in 1825 by Edward 
Craig. A more modern one is by O. Kegan Paul, the 
London publisher, who was also a man of letters. Early 
translations from the older French, Italian and other 
Continental writers have frequently come down to us withoat 
mention of translators’ names on title-pages or in the pre- 
fatory matter.

  others. . You take away the inconvenience, but 
not the injustice, and thus you do not render it 
lovable to those who hate injustice; you render 
it lovable only to the unjust, who find in it an 
enemy no longer. Thus you remain unjust and 
ean please none but the unjust. 
Or Sexr-Love.—The nature of self-love and of 
this human ‘‘I’’ is to love self only, and con- 
sider self only. But what can it do? It ean not 
prevent the object it loves from being full of 
faults and miseries; man. would fain be great and 
sees that he is little; would fain be happy, and 
sees that he is miserable; would fain be perfect, 
and sees that he is full of imperfections; would 
fain be the object of the love and esteem of men, 
and sees that his faults merit only their aversion 
and contempt. The embarrassment wherein he 
finds himself produces in him the most unjust and 
criminal passion imaginable. For he conceives a 
mortal hatred against that truth which blames 
him and convinces him of his faults. Desiring to 
annihilate it, yet unable to destroy it in its 
essence, he destroys it as much as he can in his 
own knowledge, and in that of others; that is to 
say, he devotes all his care to the concealment of 
his faults, both from others and from himself, 
and he ean neither bear that others should show 
them to him, nor that they should see them. 
It is no doubt an evil to be full of faults, but 
it is a greater evil to be full of them, yet un- 
willing to reeognize them, because that is to add 
the further fault of a voluntary illusion. We do 
not like others to deceive us, we do not think 
it just in them to require more esteem from us 
than they deserve; it is therefore unjust that we 
119
-P-A-G-E-135
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  should deceive them, desiring more esteem from 
them than we deserve. 
Thus if they discover no more imperfections 
and vices in us than we‘really have, it is plain 
they do us no wrong, since it is not they who 
cause them; but rather they who do us a service, 
since they help us to deliver ourselves from an 
evil, the ignorance of these imperfections. We 
ought not to be troubled that they know our 
faults and despise us, since it is but just they 
should know us as we are, and despise us if we 
are despicable. 
Sueh are the sentiments which would arise in 
a heart full of equity and justice. What should 
we say then of our own heart, finding in it a 
wholly contrary disposition? For is it not true 
that we hate truth, and those who tell it us, and 
that we would wish them to have an erroneously 
favorable opinion of us, and to esteem us other 
than indeed we are? 
One proof of this fills me with dismay. The 
Catholic religion does not oblige us to tell out 
our sins indiscriminately to all; it allows us to 
remain hidden from men in general; but she ex- 
eepts one alone, to whom she commands us to 
open the very depths of our hearts, and to show 
ourselves to him as we are. There is but this one 
man in the world whom she orders us to unde- 
ceive; she binds him to an inviolable secrecy, so 
that this knowledge is to him as tho it were not. 
We can imagine nothing more charitable and 
more tender. Yet such is the corruption of man, 
that he finds even this law harsh, and it is one 
of the main reasons which has set a large portion 
of Europe in revolt against the Church.

How unjust and unreasonable is the human 
heart which finds it hard to be obliged to do in 
regard to one man what in some degree it. were 
just to do to all men. for is it just that we 
should deceive them? 
There are different degrees in this dislike to 
the truth, but it may be said that all have it in 
some degree, for it is inseparable from self-love. 
This false delicacy causes those who must needs 
reprove others. to choose so many windings and 
modifications in order to avoid shocking them. 
They must needs lessen our faults, seem to ex- 
euse them, mix praises with their blame, give evi- 
denees of affection and esteem. Yet this medicine 
is bitter to self-love, which takes as little as it 
can, always with disgust, often with a secret anger. 
Hence it happens that if any desire our love, 
they avoid doing us a service which they know 
to be disagreeable; they treat us as we would 
wish to be treated: we hate the truth, and they 
hide it from us; we wish to be flattered, they 
flatter us; we love to be deceived, they deceive us. 
Thus each degree of good fortune which raises 
us in the world removes us further from truth, 
because we fear most to wound those whose affec- 
tion is most useful, and whose dislike is most 
dangerous. A prince may be the byword of all 
Europe, yet he alone know nothing of it. I am 
not surprized; to speak the truth is useful to 
whom it is spoken, but disadvantageous to those 
who speak it, since it makes them hated. Now 
those who Hve with princes love their own in- 
terests more than that of the prince they serve, 
and thus they take care not to benefit him so as 
to do themselves a disservice.

This misfortune is, no doubt, greater and more 
eommon in the higher classes, but lesser men are 
not exempt from it, since there is always an in- 
terest in making men love us. Thus human life 
is but a perpetual illusion, an interchange of de- 
eeit and flattery. No one speaks of us in our 
presence as in our absence. The society of men 
is founded on this universal deceit; few friend- 
ships would last if every man knew what his 
friend said of him behind his back, tho he then 
spoke in sincerity and without passion. 
Man is, then, only disguise, falsehood, and 
hypocrisy, both in himself and with regard to 
others. He will not be told the truth; he avoids 
telling it to others; and all these tendencies, so 
far removed from justice and reason, have their 
natural roots in his heart.

the most miraculous, the most magnificent, the 
most confounding, the most unheard-of, the most 
singular, the most extraordinary, the most in-

Madame de Coulanges: ‘‘It is really very hard

AN IMPOSING FUNERAL DESCRIBED* 
I must return to narration, it is a folly I can 
never resist. Prepare, therefore, for a description. 
T was yesterday at a service performed in honor of 
the Chancellor Segnier at the Oratory. Painting, 
seulpture, music, rhetorie—in a word, the four 
liberal arts—were at the expense of it. Nothing 
could exceed the beauty of the decorations; they 
were finely imagined, and designed by Le Brun. 
The mausoleum reached to the top of the dome, 
adorned with a thousand lamps, and a variety 
of figures characteristic of him in whose honor 
it was erected. Beneath were four figures of 
Death, bearing the marks of his several dignities, 
as having taken away his honors with his life. 
One of them held his helmet, another his ducal

  eoronet, another the ensigns of his order, an- 
other his chancellor’s mace. The four sister 
arts, painting, music, eloquence, and sculpture, 
were represented in deep distress, bewailing the 
loss of their protector. The first representation 
was supported by the four virtues, fortitude, 
temperance, justice, and religion. Above these, 
four angels, or genii, received the soul of the 
deceased, and se med preening their purple wings 
- to bear their precious charge to heaven. The 
mausoleum was adorned with a variety of little 
seraphs who supported an illuminated. shrine, 
which was fixt to the top of the cupola. Nothing 
so magnificent or so well imagined was ever seen; 
it is Le Brun’s masterpiece. The whole church 
was adorned with pictures, devices, and emblems, 
which all bore some relation to the life, or office 
of the chancellor; and some of his noblest actions 
were represented in painting. Madame de Ver- 
neuil offered to purchase all the decoration at 
a great price; but it was unanimously resolved 
by those who had contributed to it to adorn a 
gallery with it, and to consecrate it as an ever- 
lasting monument of their gratitude and mag- 
Nificence. The assembly was grand and nu- 
merous, but without confusion. I sat next to 
Monsieur de Tulle, Madame Colbert and the Duke 
of Monmouth, who is as handsome as when we 
saw him at the palais royal. (Let me tell you 
in a parenthesis that he is going to the army 
to join the King.) A young father of the Oratory 
came to speak the funeral oration.: I desired 
Monsieur de Tulle to bid him come down, and 
to mount the pulpit in his place; since nothing 
could sustain the beauty of the spectacle, and

  the excellence of the musie but the force of his 
eloquence. 
My child, this young man trembled when he be- 
gan, and we all trembled for him. Our ears were 
at first struck with a provincial accent; he is of 
Marseilles, and called Lené. But as he recovered 
from his confusion, he became so brilliant; estab- 
blished himself so well, gave so just a measure of 
praise to the deceased; touched with so much ad- 
dress and delicacy all the passages in his life 
where delicacy was required! placed in so true 
a light all that was most worthy of admiration; 
employed all the charms of expression, all the 
masterly strokes of eloquence with so much 
propriety and so much grace that every one 
present, without exception, burst into applause, 
charmed with so perfect, so finished a perform- 
ance. He is twenty-eight years of age, the 
intimate friend of M. de Tulle, who accom- 
panied him when he left the assembly. We were 
for naming him the Chevalier Masearon, and 
I think he will even surpass his friend. As for 
the music, it was fine beyond all description. 
Baptiste exerted himself to the utmost, and was 
assisted by all the King’s musicians. There was 
an addition made to that fine ‘‘Miserere,’’ and 
there was a ‘‘Libera’’ which filled the eyes of 
the whole assembly with tears; I do not think 
the music in heaven could exceed it. There were 
several prelates present. I desired Guitaut to 
look for the good Bishop of Marseilles, but we 
could not see him. I whispered him that if it 
had been the funeral oration of any person living 
to whom he might have made his court by it he 
would not have failed to have been there. This

IN THE SERVICE OF DR. SANGRADO* 
I peterminep to throw myself in the way of 
Sigfor Arias de Londona, and to look out for a 
new berth in his register; but as I was on my 
way to No Thoroughfare, who should come across 
me but Doctor Sangrado, whom I had not seen 
since the day of my master’s death. I took the 
liberty of touching my hat. He kenned me in 
a twinkling, tho I had changed my dress; and 
with as much warmth as his temperament would 
allow him, ‘‘Heyday!’’ said he, ‘‘the very lad 
I wanted to see; you have never been out of 
my thought. I have occasion for a clever fellow 
about me, and pitched upon you as the very 
thing, if you can read and write.’’ ‘‘Sir,’’ re-

  look no further. Come home with me: it will be 
ali comfort; I shall behave to you like a brother. 
You will have no wages, but everything will be 
found you. You shall eat and drink according 
to the true faith, and be taught to cure all dis- 
eases. In a word, you shall rather be my young 
Sangrado than my footman.’’ 
I closed in with the doetor’s proposal, in the 
hope of becoming an Esculapius under so inspired 
a master. He carried me home on the spur of 
the occasion, to install me in my honorable em- | 
ployment; which honorable employment consisted. 
in writing down the name and residence of the 
patients who sent for him in his absence. There 
had indeed been a register for this purpose, kept 
“by an old domestic; but she had not the gift of 
spelling accurately, and wrote a most perplexing 
hand. This aceount’I was to keep. It might 
truly be ealled a bill of mortality; for my mem- 
bers all went from bad to worse during the short 
time they continued in this system. .I was a 
sort of bookkeeper for the other world, to take 
places in the stage, and to see that the first come 
were the first served. My pen was always: in 
my hand, for Doctor Sangrado had more practise 
than any physician of. his time in Valladolid. 
He had got into reputation with the publie by 
a certain professional slang, humored by a med- 
ieal face, and some extraordinary cases. more 
honored by implicit faith than serupulous in- 
vestigation. 
He was in no want of patients, nor conse- 
quently of property. He did not keep the best 
house in the world: we lived with some little 
attention to economy. The usual bill of fare 
130
-P-A-G-E-146
  
ALAIN RENE LE SAGE 
  consisted of peas, beans, boiled apples or cheese. 
He considered this food as best suited to ‘the 
human stomach; that is to say, as most amenable 
to the grinders, whence it was to encounter the 
process of digestion. Nevertheless, easy as was 
their passage, he was not for stopping the way 
with too much of them; and to he sure, he was 
in the right. But tho he eautioned the maid 
and me against repletion in respect of solids, it 
was made up by free permission to drink as much 
water as we liked. Far from preseribing us any 
limits in that direction, he would tell us some- 
times: ‘‘Drink, my children: health consists in 
the pliability and moisture of the parts. Drink 
water by pailfuls: it is a universal dissolvent; 
water liquefies all the salts. Ys the course of 
the blood a little sluggish? this grand principle 
sets it forward: too rapid? its career is checked.’ 
Our doetor was so orthodox on this head that 
tho advanced in years, he drank nothing himself 
but water. He defined old age to be a natural 
consumption which dries us up and wastes us 
away :.on this principle he deplored the ignoranee 
of those whe eall wine ‘‘old men’s milk.’’ He 
maintained that wine wears them out and cor- 
rodes them; and pleaded with all the force of 
his eloquence against that liquor, fatal in com- 
mon both to the young and old—that friend with 
a serpent in its bosom—that pleasure with a 
dagger under its girdle. 
In spite of these fine arguments, at the end 
of a week a looseness ensued, with some twinges, 
which I was blasphemous enough to saddle on 
the universal dissolvent and the new-fangled diet. 
I stated my symptoms to my master, in the hope 
131
-P-A-G-E-147
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  
that he would relax the rigor of his regimen and 
qualify my meals with a little wine; but his 
hostility to that liquor was inflexible. ‘‘If you 
have not philosophy enough,’’ said he, ‘‘for pure 
water, there are innocent infusions to strengthen 
the stomach against the nausea of aqueous quaff- 
ings. Sage, for example, has a very pretty flavor; 
and if you wish to heighten it into a debauch, 
it is only mixing rosemary, wild poppy, and other 
simples with it—but no compounds.’’ 
In vain did he crack off his water, and teach 
me the secret of composing delicious messes. 
I was so abstemious that, remarking my modera- 
tion, he said: ‘‘In good sooth, Gil Blas, I marvel 
not that you are no better than you are: you do 
not drink enough, my friend. Water taken in 
a smali quantity serves only to separate the par- 
ticles of bile and set them in action; but our 
practise is to drown them in a eopious drench. 
Fear not, my. good lad, lest a superabundance 
of liquid should either weaken or chill your 
stomach; far from thy better judgment be that 
silly fear of unadulterated drink. I will insure 
you against all consequences; and if my authority 
will not serve your turn, read Celsus. . That 
oracle of the ancient makes an admirable pane- 
gyrie on water; in short, he says in plain terms 
that those who plead an inconstant stomach in 
favor of wine, publish a ‘libel on their own 
viscera, and make their constitution a pretense 
for their sensuality.’’ 
As it would have been ungenteel in me to 
run riot on my entrance into the career of prac: 
tise, I affected thorough conviction ; indeed, I 
thought there was something in it. T therefore 
132
-P-A-G-E-148
  ALAIN RENE LE SAGE 
  went on drinking water on the authority of 
Celsus, or to speak in scientific terms, I began 
to drown the bile in copious drenches of that 
unadulterated liquor; and tho [ felt myself more 
out of order from day to day, prejudice won 
the cause against experience. It is evident there- 
fore that I was in the right road to the practise 
of physic. Yet I could not always be insensible 
to the qualms which increased in my frame, to 
that degree as to determine me on quitting Doctor 
Sangrado. But he invested me with a new office 
which changed my tone. ‘‘Hark you, my ehild,’’ 
said he to me one day: ‘‘I am not one of those 
hard and ungrateful masters who leave their 
household to grow gray in service, without a 
suitable reward. I am well pleased with you, ' 
I have a regard for you; and without waiting 
till you have served your time, I will make your 
fortune. Without more ado, I will initiate you 
in the healing art, of which I have for so many 
years been at the head. Other physicians make 
the science to consist of various unintelligible 
branches; but I will shorten the road for you, 
and dispense with the drudgery of studying nat- 
ural philosophy, pharmacy, botany, and anatomy. 
Remember, my friend, that bleeding and drinking 
warm water are the two grand principles—the 
true secret of curing all the distempers incident 
to humanity. Yes, this marvelous secret which 
I reveal to you, and which Nature, beyond the 
reach of my colleagues, has failed in rescuing 
from my pen, is comprehended in these two 
articles; namely, bleeding and drenching. Here

almost every Sunday, ought of themselves to goad

being handed down to posterity as a perfect 
pulpit orator has its irresistible attractions. My 
compositions are generally thought to be equally 
powerful and persuasive; but I could wish of all 
things to steer clear of the rock on which good 
authors split who are too long before the public,

‘*Heaven be praised, my lord,’’ said I, ‘‘there 
is no need to trouble yourself with any such 
thoughts yet. Besides, an understanding of your 
Grace’s mold and caliber will last out double 
the time of a common genius; or to speak with 
more certainty and truth, it will never be the 
worse for wear, if you live to the age of Methu- 
saleh. I consider you as a second Cardinal 
Ximenes, whose powers, superior to decay, in- 
stead of flagging with years, seemed to derive 
new vigor from their approximation with the 
heavenly regions.’? ‘‘No flattery, my friend!’’ 
interrupted he. ‘‘I know myself to be in danger 
of failing all at once. At my age one begins 
to be sensible of infirmities, and those of the 
body communicate with the mind. I repeat it 
to you, Gil Blas, as soon as you shall be of 
opinion that my head is not so clear as usual, 
give me warning of it instantly. Do not be 
afraid of offending by frankness and sincerity: 
to put me in mind of my own frailty will be the 
strongest proof of your affection for me. Be- 
sides, your very interest is concerned in it; for 
if it should, by any spite of chance toward you, 
eome to my ears that the people say in town, 
‘His Grace’s sermons preduce no longer their 
aceustomed impression; it is time for him to 
abandon his pulpit to younger candidates’— 
I do assure you, most seriously and solemnly, 
you will lose not only my friendship, but the 
provision for life that I have promised you.

THE DEATH OF THE DAUPHIN* 
Monszicnrur LE Daveuty, ill and agitated by 
the most bitter grief, kept his chamber; but on 
Saturday morning of the 13th, being prest to go 
to Marly to avoid the horror of the noise where 
the Dauphine was lying dead, he set out for that 
place at seven o’clock in the morning. Shortly 
after arriving he heard mass in the chapel, and 
thence was carried in a chair to the window 
of one of his rooms. Madame de Maintenon 
came to see him there afterward. The anguish 
of the interview was speedily too much for her, 
and she went away. Early in the morning I 
went uninvited to see M. le Dauphin. He showed 
me that he perceived this with an air of gentle- 
ness and of affection which penetrated me. But 
I was terrified with his looks, constrained, fixt

Regency.” ‘Translated by Bayle St. John, traveler and 
author, his “Village Life in Egypt” appearing in 1853,

  and with something wild about them; with the 
change of his looks and with the marks there, 
livid rather than red, that I observed in good 
namber and large; marks observed by the others 
also. 
The’ Dauphin was standing. In a few moments 
he was apprized that the King had awaked. The 
tears that he had restrained now rolled from. 
his eyes; he turned round at the news, but said 
nothing, remaining stock still. His three at- 
tendants proposed to him once or twice that he 
should go to the King. He neither spoke nor 
stirred. I approached and made signs to him 
to go, then softly spoke to the same effect. See- 
ing that he still remained speechless and motion- 
less, I made bold to take his arm, representing 
to him that sooner or later he must see the King, 
who expected him, and assuredly with the desire 
to see and embrace him. He cast upon me a 
look that pierced my soul and went away. I 
followed him some few steps. and then withdrew 
to recover breath. I never saw him again. May 
I, by the merey of God, see him eternally where 
God’s goodness doubtless has placed him! 
The Dauphin reached the chamber of the King, 
full just then of company. As soon as he ap- 
peared the King ealled him and embraced him 
tenderly again and again. These first moments, 
so touching, passed in words broken by sobs and

the Dauphin, was terrified by the same things 
that had previously struck me with affright. Ev-

than the others. The King ordered them to feel

ward; for the time they contented themselves 
with saying that it was not regular, and that the 
Dauphin would do wisely to go to bed. The 
King embraced him again, recommended him very 
tenderly to take care of himself, and ordered 
him to go to bed. He obeyed and rose no more! 
It. was now late in the morning. The King 
had passed a cruel night and had a bad headache; 
he saw at his dinner the few courtiers who pre- 
sented themselves, and then after dinner went 
to the Dauphin. The fever had augmented, the 
pulse was worse than before. The King passed 
into the apartment of Madame de Maintenon, 
and, the Dauphin was left with attendants and 
his doctors. He spent the day in prayers and 
holy reading. 
On the morrow, Sunday, the uneasiness felt 
on account of the Dauphin augmented. He him- 
self did not conceal -his belief that he would 
never rise again, and that the plot Pondin had 
warned him of had been executed. He explained 
himself to this effect more than once and always 
with a disdain of earthly grandeur and an in- 
eomparable submission and love of God. It is 
impossible to describe the general consternation. 
On Monday the 15th the King was bled. The 
Dauphin was no better than before. The King 
and Madame de Maintenon saw him separately 
several times during the day, which was passed 
in prayers and reading. 
On Tuesday, the 16th, the Dauphin was worse. 
He felt himself devoured by a consuming fire, 
‘which the external fever did not seem to justify, 
but ‘the ‘pulse was very extraordinary and ex- 
esedingly menacing. This was a deceptive day.

  The marks in the Dauphin’s face extended all 
over the body. They were regarded as the marks 
of measles. Hope arose thereon, but the doctors 
and the most clear-sighted of the court could not 
forget that these same marks had shown them- 
selves on the body of the Dauphine, a fact un- 
known out of her chamber until after death. 
On Wednesday, the 17th, the malady consid- 
erably increased. I had news at all times of 
the Dauphin’s state from Cheverney, an excellent 
apothecary of the King and of my family. He 
hid nothing from us. He had.told us what he 
thought of the Dauphine’s illness; he told us 
now what he thought of the Dauphin’s. I no 
longer hoped therefore, or rather I hoped to the 
end against all hope. 
On Wednesday the pains increased. They were 
like a devouring fire, but more violent than ever. 
Very late into the evening the Dauphin sent to 
the King for permission to receive the commu- 
nion early the next morning and without display 
at the mass performed in his chamber. Nobody 
heard of this that evening; it was not known 
until the following morning. Iwas in extreme 
desolation. I scarcely saw the King once a day. 
I did nothing but go in quest of news several 
times a day, and to the house of M. de Chevreuse, 
where I was completely free. M. de Chevreuse— 
always calm, always sanguine—endeavored to 
prove to us by his medical reasonings that there 
was more reason to hope than to fear; but he 
did so with a tranquillity that roused my im- 
patience. I returned home to pass a eruel night. 
On Thursday morning, the 18th February, I 
learned that the Dauphin, who had waited for

  midnight with impatience, had heard mass im- 
mediately after the communion, had passed two 
hours in devout communication with God, and 
that his reason then became embarrassed. Ma- 
dame de Saint-Simon told me afterward that 
he had received extreme unction; in fine that 
he had died at half-past eight. 
These memoirs are not written to describe my 
private sentiments. But in reading them—if 
long after me they shall ever appear—my state 
and that of Madame de Saint-Simon will only 
too keenly be felt. I will content myself with 
saying that the first days after the Dauphin’s 
death scarcely appeared to us more than mo- 
ments; that I wished to quit all, to withdraw 
from the court and the world, and that I was 
only hindered by the wisdom, conduct and power 
over me of Madame de Saint-Simon, who yet had 
some trouble to subdue my sorrowful desire.

  Maintenon,’ all the ladies of the court, and a 
number of gentlemen, stationed themselves upon 
an old rampart, from whieh the plain and all the 
disposition of the troops could be seen. I was in 
the half-circle very close to the King. It was 
the most beautiful sight. that can be imagined 
to see all that army, and the prodigious number 
of spectators on horse and foot, and that game 
of attack and defense so cleverly conducted. 
But a spectacle of another sort—that I could 
paint forty years hence as well as to-day, so 
strongly did it strike me—was that which from 
the summit of this rampart the King gave to 
all his army, and to the innumerable crowd of 
spectators of all kinds in the plain below. Ma- 
dame de Maintenon faced the plain and the 
troops in her sedan-chair, alone, between its 
three windows drawn ‘up; her porters having 
retired to a distance. On the left pole in front 
8 At the period of which Saint-Simon here writes, Madame 
de Maintenon had acquired that ascendency over Louis XIV 
which resulted in her marriage to him. She had been born 
in a prison, and was three years the senior of the King. 
Her first husband was the poet Scarron, at whose death, 
after a marriage of nine years, she had found herself in pov- 
erty. She secured a pension from Anne of Austria, the 
mother of the King, but at the queen-mother’s death the pen- 
sion was discontinued. She was placed in charge o1 the 
King’s natural son, to whom she became much devoted, and 
was advanced through the King’s favor to various positions 
at court, receiving in 1678 the title of marquise. Five years later the queen of Louis XIV died, and Louis married 
Madame de Maintenon, whose influence over him in matters 
of church and state became thereafter very great. She was 
® patroness of art and literature, intensely oxthodox in re- 
ligion, and has been held largely responsible for the King’s 
revocation of the, Edict of Nantes, which occurred during 
the year of their marriage, tho she opposed the violent per- secutions which followed.

sat Madame Ja Duchesse de Bourgogne; and on 
the same side, in a semicircle, standing, were 
Madame la Duchesse, Madame la Princesse de 
Conti, and all the ladies—and behind them again, 
many men. At the right window was the King, 
standing, and a little in the rear a semicircle 
of the most distinguished men of the court. The 
King was nearly always uncovered; and every 
now and then stooped to speak to Madame de 
Maintenon, and explain to her what she saw, and 
the reason of each movement. 
Eaeh time that he did so she was obliging 
enough to open the window four or five inches, 
but never half-way; for I noticed particularly, 
and I admit that I was more attentive to this 
spectacle than to that of the troops. Sometimes 
she opened of her own accord to ask some ques- 
tion of him: but generally it was he who, without 
waiting for her, stooped down to instruct her 
of what was passing; avid sometimes, if she did 
not notice him, he tapped at the glass to make 
her open it. He never spoke save to her, except 
when he gave a few brief orders, or just an- 
swered Madame la Duchesse de Bourgogne, who 
wanted to make him speak, and with whom Ma- 
dame de Maintenon carried on a conversation 
by signs, without opening the front window, 
through which the young princess screamed to 
her from time to time. I watched the coun- 
tenance of every one carefully: all exprest sur- 
prize, tempered with prudence, and shame that 
was, as it were, ashamed of itself; every one 
behind the chair and in the semicircle watched 
this scene more than what was going on in the 
army. The King often pot his hat on the top

  of the chair in order to get his head in to speak; 
and this continual exercise tired his loins very 
much, Monseigneur was on horseback in the 
plain with the young princes. It was about five 
e’clock in the afternoon, and the weather was 
as brilliant as could be desired. 
Opposite the sedan-chair was an opening with 
some steps eut through the wall, and eommu- 
nicating with the plain below. It had been made 
for the purpose of fetching orders from the King, 
should they be necessary. The case happened. 
Crenan, who commanded, sent Conillae, an officer 
in one of the defending regiments, to ask for 
some instructions from the King. Conillae had 
been stationed at the foot of the rampart, where 
what was passing above could not be seen. He 
mounted the steps; and as soon as his head and 
shoulders were at the top, caught sight of the 
chair, the King, and all the assembled company. 
He was not prepared for such a scene; and it 
struck him with such astonishment that he stopt 
short, with mouth and eyes wide open—surprize 
painted upon every feature. I see him now as 
distinctly as I did then. The King, as well as 
the rest of the company, remarked the agitation 
of Conillas, and said to him with emotion, ‘‘Wel, 
Conillae! come up.’’ Conillae remained motion- 
less, and the King continued, ‘‘Come up. What 
is the matter?’’ Conillae, thus addrest, finished 
his ascent, and came toward the King with slow 
and trembling steps, rolling his eyes from right 
to left like one deranged. Then he stammered 
something, but in a tone so low that it could not 
be heard. ‘‘What do you say?’’ cried the King. 
“(Speak up.’’ But Conillae was unable; and 
148

  the King, finding he could get nothing out of 
him, told him to go away. He did not need to 
be told twice, but disappeared at once. As soon 
as he was gone, the King looking round said, 
“T don’t know what is the matter with Conillac. 
He has lost his wits: he did not remember what 
he had to say to me.’’ No one answered. 
Toward the moment of the capitulation, Ma- 
dame de Maintenon apparently asked permission 
to go away; for the King cried, ‘‘The chairmen 
of madame!’’ They came and took her away; 
in, less than a quarter ef an hour afterward the 
King retired also, and nearly everybody else. 
There was much interchange of glances, nudging 
with elbows, and then whisperings in the ear. 
Everybody was full of what had taken place on 
the ramparts between the King and Madame de 
Maintenon. Even the soldiers asked what meant 
that sedan-chair, and the King every moment 
stooping to put his head inside of it. It became 
necessary gently to silence these questions of the 
troops. What effect this sight had upon for- 
eigners present, and what they said of it, may be 
imagined. All over Europe it was as much talked 
of as the camp of Compiégne itself, with all its 
pomp and prodigious splendor.

OF THE CAUSES WHICH DESTROYED 
ROME? 
Wuiuts the sovereignty of Rome was confined 
to Italy, it was easy for the commonwealth to 
subsist: every soldier was at the same time a 
citizen; every Consul raised an army, and other 
eitizens marched into the field under his suc- 
cessor: as their forces were not very numerous, 
- such persons only were received among the troops 
as had possessions considerable enough to make 
them interested in the preservation of the city; 
the Senate kept a watchful eye over the conduct 
of the generals, and did not give them an oppor-

title of “the greatest man of letters of the French eighteenth 
century.” He places him above Voltaire because “‘of his

  tunity of machinating anything to the prejudice 
of their country. 
But after the legions had passed the Alps and 
erossed the sea, the soldiers whom the Romans 
had been obliged to leave during several cam- 
paigns in the countries they were subduing, lost 
insensibly that genius and turn of mind which 
characterized a Roman citizen; and the generals 
having armies and kingdoms at their disposal 
were sensible of their own strength, and would 
no longer obey. 
The soldiers therefore began to acknowledge 
no superior but their general; to found their 
hopes on him only, and to view the city as from 
a great distance: they were no longer the soldiers 
of the republic, but of Sulla, of Marius, of Pom- 
pey, and of Cesar. The Romans could no longer 
tell whether the person who headed an army in 
a province was their general or their enemy. 
So long as the people of Rome were corrupted 
by their tribunes only, on whom they could bestow 
nothing but their power, the Senate could easily 
defend themselves, because they acted consistent- 
ly and with one regular tenor, whereas the com- 
mon people were continually shifting from the 
extremes of fury to the extremes of cowardice; 
but when they. were enabled to invest their fa- 
vorites with a formidable exterior authority, the 
whole wisdom of the Senate was baffled, and the 
commonwealth was undone. 
The reason why free states are not so per- 
manent as other forms of government is because 
the misfortunes and successes which happen to 
them generally occasion the loss of liberty; 
whereas the successes and misfortunes of an 
151
-P-A-G-E-163
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS rr 
arbitrary government contribute equally to the 
enslaving of the people. A wise republic ought 
not to run any hazard which may expose it to 
good or ill fortune; the only happiness the sev- 
eral individuals of it should aspire after is to 
give perpetuity to their state. 
If the unbounded extent of the Roman empire 
proved the ruin of the republic, the vast compass 
of the city was no less fatal to it. 
The Romans had subdued the whole universe 
by the assistance of the nations of Italy, on 
whom they had bestowed various privileges at 
different times. Most of those nations did not 
at first set any great value on the freedom of 
the city of Rome, and some chose rather to pre- 
serve their ancient usages; but when this priv- 
ilege became that of universal sovereignty—when 
aman who was not a Roman citizen was con- 
sidered as nothing, and with this title was every- 
thing—the people of Italy resolved either to be 
Romans or die: not being able to obtain this 
by cabals and entreaties, they had recourse to 
arms; and rising in all that part of Italy opposite 
to the Ionian sea, the rest of the allies were 
going to follow their example. Rome, being now 
forced to combat against those who were, if I 
may be allowed the figure, the hands with which 
they shaekled the universe, was upon the brink 
of ruin; the Romans were going to be confined 
merely to their walls: they ‘therefore granted 
this so much wished-for privilege to the allies 
who had not yet been wanting in fidelity; and 
they indulged it, by insensible degrees, to all 
other nations. 
But now Rome was no longer that city the 
162
-P-A-G-E-164
  BARON DE MONTESQUIEU 
  inhabitants of which had breathed one and the 
same spirit, the same love for liberty, the same 
hatred of tyranny; a city in which a jealousy 
of the poner of the Senate and of the preroga- 
tives of the great (ever accompanied with re- 
spect) was only a love of equality. The nations 
of Italy being made citizens of Rome, every eity 
brought thither its genius, its particular interests, 
and its dependence on some mighty protector: 
Rome, being now rent and divided, no longer 
£-rmed one entire body, and men were no longer 
citizens of it but in a kind of fictitious way; 
as there were no longer the same magistrates, 
the same wails, the same gods, the same temples, 
the same burying-places, Rome was no longer 
beheld with the same eyes; the citizens were no 
longer fired with the same love for their country, 
and the Roman sentiments were obliterated. 
Cities and nations were now invited to Rome 
by the ambitious, to disconcert the suffrages, or 
influence them in their own favor; the publie 
assemblies were so many conspiracies against the 
state, and a tumultuous crowd of seditious 
wretches was dignified with the title of Comitia. 
The authority of the people and their laws— 
nay, that people themselves—were no more than 
so many chimeras; and so universal was the 
anarchy of those times that it was not possible 
to determine whether the people had made a law 
or not. 
Authors enlarge very copiously on the divisions 
which proved the destruction of Rome;'but their 
readers seldom discover those divisions to have 
been always necessary and inevitable. The gran- 
deur of the republic was the only source of that 
153
-P-A-G-E-165
    THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  calamity, and exasperated popular tumults into 
civil wars. Dissensions were not to be prevented ; 
and those martial spirits which were so fierce 
and formidable abroad could not be habituated 
to any considerable moderation at home. Those 
who expect in a free state to see the people 
undaunted in war and pusillanimous in peace, 
are certainly desirous of impossibilities; and it 
may be advanced as a general rule that whenever 
a perfect calm is visible, in a state that calls 
itself a republic, the spirit of liberty no longer 
subsists. 
Union, in a body politic, is a very equivocal 
term: true union is such a harmony as makes 
all the particular parts, as opposite as they may 
seem to us, coneur to the general welfare of the 
society, in the same manner as discords in music 
contribute to the general melody of sound. Union 
may prevail in a state full of seeming commo- 
tions; or in other words, there may be a harmony 
from whence results prosperity, which alone is 
true peace; and may be considered in the same 
view as the various parts of this universe, which 
are eternally connected by the action of some 
and the reaction of others. 
In a despotic state, indeed, which is every 
government where the power is immoderately 
exerted, a real division is perpetually kindled. 
The peasant, the soldier, the merchant, the magis- 
trate, and the grandee, have no other conjunction 
than what arises from the ability of the one to 
oppress the other without resistance; and if at 
any time a union happens to be introduced, citi- 
zens are not then united, but dead bodies are 
laid in the grave contiguous to each other. 
154
-P-A-G-E-166
  BARON DE MONTESQUIEU 
  It must be acknowledged that the Roman laws 
were too weak to govern the republic; but experi- 
ence has proved it to be an invariable fact that 
good laws, which raise the reputation and power 
of a small republic, become incommodious to it 
when once its grandeur is established, because 
it was their natural effect to make a great people 
but not to govern them. 
The difference is very considerable between 
good laws and those which may be called con- 
venient; between such laws as give a people 
dominion over others, and such as continue tnem 
in the possession of power when they have once 
acquired it. 
There is at this time a republic in the world 
(the Canton of Berne), of which few. persons 
have any knowledge, and which, by plans accom- 
plished in silence and secrecy, is daily enlarging 
its power. And certain it is that if it ever rises 
to that height of grandeur for which it seems 
preordained by its wisdom, it must inevitably 
change its laws; and the necessary innovations 
will not be eff .cted by any legislator, but must 
spring from corruption itself. 
Rome was founded for grandeur, and her laws 
had an admirable tendency to bestow it; for 
which reason, in all the variations of her govern- 
ment, whether monarchy, aristocracy, or popular, 
she constantly engaged in enterprises which re- 
quired conduct to accomplish them, and always 
sueceeded. The experience of a day did not 
furnish her with more wisdom than all other 
nations, but she obtained it by a long succession 
of events. She sustained a small, a moderate, 
and an immense fortune with the same supe-

  riority, derived true welfare from the whole train 
of her prosperities, and refined every instance 
of calamity into beneficial instructions. 
She lost her liberty because she completed her 
work too soon.

OF THE RELATION OF LAWS TO DIF- 
FERENT HUMAN BEINGS * 
Laws, in their most general signification, are 
the necessary relations arising from the nature 
of things. In this sense all beings have their 
laws; the Deity His laws, the material world its 
laws, the intelligences superior to man their laws, 
the beasts their laws, man his laws. 
They who assert that a blind fatality produced 
the various effects we behold in this world talk 
very absurdly; for can anything be more un- 
reasonable than to pretend that a blind fatality 
could be productive of intelligent beings? 
There is, then, a primitive reason; and laws 
are the relations subsisting between it and dif- 
ferent beings, and the relations of these to one 
another. 
God is related to the universe, as Creator and 
Preserver; the laws by which He created all 
things are those by which He preserves them. 
He acts according to these rules, because He 
knows them; He knows them, because He made 
*From “The Spirit of Laws.” The translation of Thomas Nugent was published in 1756. ‘

  them; and He made them, because they are rela- 
tive to His wisdom and power. 
Since we observe that the world, tho formed 
by the motion of matter, and void of under- 
standing, subsists through so long a succession 
of ages, its motions must certainly be directed 
by invariable laws; and could we imagine an- 
othet world, it must also have constant rules, 
or it would inevitably perish. 
Thus the creation, which seems an arbitrary 
act, supposes laws as invariable as those of the 
fatality of the atheists. It would be absurd to 
say that the Creator might govern the world 
without those rules, since without them it could 
not subsist. . 
These rules are a fixt and variable relation. 
In bodies moved, the motion is received, in- 
creased, diminished, lost, aceording to the rela- 
tions of the quantity of matter and velocity; 
each diversity is uniformity, each change is con- 
staney. 
Particular intelligent beings may have laws of 
their own making, but they have some likewise 
which they never made. Before they were intel- 
ligent beings, they were possible; they had there- 
fore possible relations, and consequently possible 
laws. Before laws were made, there were rela- 
tions of possible justice. To say that there is nothing just or unjust but what is commanded 
or forbidden by positive laws is the same as 
saying that before the describing of a circle all 
the radii were not equal. 
_ We must therefore acknowledge relations of 
jastice antecedent to the positive law by which they are established: as for instance, that if 
157
-P-A-G-E-169
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  human societies existed it would be right to 
conform to their laws; if there were intelligent 
beings that had received a benefit of another 
being, they ought to show their gratitude; if 
one intelligent being had created another intel- 
ligent being, the latter ought to continue in its 
original state of dependence; if one intelligent 
being injures another, it deserves a retaliation; 
- and so on. 
But the intelligent world is far frem being so 
well governed as the physical. For tho the for- 
mer has also its laws, which of their own nature 
are invariable, it does not conform to them so 
exactly as the physical world. This is because, 
on the one hand, particular intelligent beings 
are of a finite nature, and consequently liable 
to error; and on the other, their nature requires 
them to be free agents. Hence they do not stead- 
ily conform to their primitive laws; and even 
those of their own -instituting they frequently 
infringe. 
Whether brutes be governed by the general 
laws of motion or by a particular movement we 
ean not determine. .Be that as it may, they have 
not a more intimate relation to God than the rest 
of the material world; and sensation is of no 
other use to them than in the relation they have 
either to other particular beings or to themselves. 
By the allurements of pleasure they preserve 
the individual, and by the same allurements they 
preserve their species. They have natural laws, 
beeause they are united by sensation; positive 
laws they have none, because they are not con- 
nected by knowledge. And yet they do not inva- 
riably conform to their natural laws; these are

an  eEnninmenmnened 
hettet observed by vegetables, that have neither 
understanding nor sense. 
Brutes are deprived of the high advantages - 
which we have; but they have some which we 
have not. They have not our hopes, but they 
are without our fears; they are subject like us 
to death, but without knowing it; even most 
of them are more attentive than we to self- : 
preservation, and do not make so bad a use of 
their passions. 
Man, as a physical being, is like other bodies, 
governed by invariable laws. As an intelligent 
being, he incessantly transgresses the laws estab- 
lished by God, and changes those of his own 
instituting. He is left to his private direction, 
tho a limited being, and subject, like all finite 
intelligences, to ignorance and error; even his 
imperfect knowledge he loses; and as a sensible 
creature, he is hurried away by a thousand im- 
petuous passions. Such a being might every 
instant forget his. Creator; God has therefore 
reminded him of his duty by the laws of religion. 
Such a being is liable every moment to forget 
himself; philosophy has provided against this by 
the laws of morality. Formed to live in society, 
he might forget his fellow creatures; legislators 
have therefore by political and civil Jaws con- 
fined him to his duty.

following was debated in a very polite and learn- 
ed company, viz., Who was the greatest man, 
Cesar, Alexander, Tamerlane, Cromwell, etc.? 
Somebody answered that Sir Isaac Newton ex- 
eelled them all. The gentleman’s assertion was 
very just; for if true greatness consists in having 
received from heaven a mighty genius, and’in 
1From the “Letters on England.” Voltaire’s visit to Eng- 
land followed immediately upon his release from imprison- 
ment in the Bastille. During the two years he spent there, 
he acquired an intimate knowledge of English life, and came 
to know most of the eminent Englishmen of the time. 
An English version of Voltaire’s writings, in thirty-five 
volumes, was published in 1761-69, with notes by Smollett 
and others. The “Letters from England” seem to have 
first appeared in English in 1734.

  having employed it to enlighten our own mind 
and that of others, a man like Sir Isaac Newton, 
whoge equal is hardly found in a thousand years, 
is the truly great man. And those politicians 
and eonquerors (and all ages produce some) were 
generally so many illustrious wicked men. That 
man claims our respect who commands over the 
minds of the rest of the world by the force of 
truth, not those who enslave their fellow crea- 
tures; he who is aequainted with the universe, 
not they who deface it. 
The most singular and thé best of all his pieces 
is that which, at this time, is the most useless 
and the least read. I mean his ‘‘Novum Scienti- 
arum Organum.’’ This is the scaffold with which 
the new philosophy was raised; and when the 
edifice was built, part of it, at least the scaffold 
was no longer of service. 
Lord Bacon was not yet acquainted with na~ 
ture, but then he knew, and pointed out the sev- 
eral paths that lead to it.. He had despised in 
his younger years the thing called philosophy in 
the universities, and did all that lay in his power 
to prevent’ those societies of men instituted to 
improve human reason from depraving it by 
their quiddities, their horrors of the vacuum, 
their substantial forms, and all those impertinent 
terms which not only ignorance had rendered 
venerable, but which had been made sacred by 
their being ridiculously blended with religion. 
He is the father of experimental philosophy. 
It must, indeed, be confest that very surprizing 
secrets had been found out before his time— 
the sea compass, printing, engraving on copper 
-plates, oil painting, looking-glasses; the art of

  restoring, in some measure, old men to their 
sight by spectacles; gunpowder, ete., had been 
discovered. -A new world had been fought for, 
found, and conquered. Would not one suppose 
that these sublime discoveries had been made by 
the greatest philosophers, and in ages much more 
enlightened than the present? But it was far 
otherwise; all these great changes happened in 
the most stupid and barbarous times. Chance 
only gave birth to most of those inventions; and 
it is very probable that what is called chance 
contributed very much to the discovery of Amer- 
ica; at least it has been always thought that 
Christopher Columbus undertook his voyage 
merely on the relation of a captain of a ship 
which a storm had driven as far westward as 
the Caribbean Island. Be this as it will, men 
had sailed round the world, and could destroy 
cities by an artificial thunder more dreadful than 
the real one; but, then, they were not acquainted 
with the circulation of the blood, the weight of the air, the laws of motions, light, the number of our planets, ete. And a man who maintained 
a thesis on Aristotle’s ‘‘Categories,’’ on the universals @ parte rei, or such-like nonsense, was looked upon as a prodigy. 
, The most astonishing, the most useful inven- tions, are not those which reflect the greatest 
honor on the human mind. It is to a mechanical instinct, which is found in many men, and not to true philosophy that most ‘arts owe their origin. 
The discovery of fire, the art of making bread, of melting and preparing metals, of building houses, and the invention of the shuttle are 
162

  infinitely more beneficial to mankind than print- 
ing or the sea compass; and yet these arts were 
invented by uncultivated, savage men. - 
What a prodigious use the Greeks and Romans 
made afterward of mechanics! Nevertheless, 
they believed that there were crystal heavens, 
that the stars were small lamps which sometimes 
fell into the sea, and one of their greatest phi- 
losophers, after long researches, found that the 
stars were so many flints which had been de- 
tached from the earth. 
In a word, no one before Lord Bacon was 
acquainted with experimental philosophy, nor 
with the several physical experiments which have 
been made since-his time. Scarce one of them 
but is hinted at in his work, and he himself had 
made several. He made a kind of ‘pneumatic 
engine, by which he guessed the elasticity of the 
air. He approached on all sides, as it were, to 
the discovery of its weight, and had very near 
attained it, but some time after Torricelli seized 
upon this truth. In a little time experimental 
philosophy began to be cultivated on a sudden 
in most parts of Europe. It was a hidden treas- 
ure which Lord Bacon had some notion of, and 
which. all the philosophers, encouraged by his 
promises, endeavored to dig up. 
But that which surprized me most was to read 
in his work, in express terms, the new attraction, 
the invention of which is aseribed to Sir Isaac 
Newton. . 
We must search, says Lord Bacon, whether 
there may not be a kind of magnetic power which 
operates between the earth and heavy bodies, 
between the moon and the ocean, between the 
163

planets, ete. In another place he says, either 
heavy bodies must be carried toward the center 
of the earth, or must be reciprocally attracted 
by it; and in the latter case it is evident that the 
nearer bodies in their falling, draw toward the 
earth, the stronger they will attract one another. 
‘We must, says he, make an experiment to see 
whether the same clock will go faster on the top 
of a mountain or at the bottom of a mine; 
whether the strength of the weights decreases on 
the mountain and increases in the mine. It is 
probable that the earth has a true attractive 
power. 
This forerunner in philosophy was also an ele- 
gant writer, a historian, and a wit. 
His moral essays are greatly esteemed, but they 
were drawn up in the view of instructing rather 
than of pleasing; and, as they are not a satire 
upon mankind, like Rochefoucauld’s ‘‘Maxims,’’ 
nor written upon a skeptical plan, like Mon- 
taigne’s ‘‘Essays,’’ they are not’so much read 
as those two ingenious authors.

ENGLAND'S REGARD FOR MEN OF 
LETTERS? 
Nurruer the English nor any other people have 
foundations established in favor of the polite arts 
like those in France. There are universities in 
most countries, but it is in France only that we

  meet with so beneficial an encouragement for 
astronomy and all parts of the mathematics, for 
physic, for reasearches into antiquity, for paint-. 
ing, sculpture, and architecture. Louis XTV has: 
immortalized his name by these several founda- 
tions, and this immortality did not cost him two 
hundred thousand livres a year. 
I must confess that one of the things I very 
much wonder at is that as the Parliament of 
Great Britain have promised a reward of £20,000 
to any person who may discover the longitude, 
“they should never have once thought to imitate 
Louis XIV in his munificence with regard to the 
arts and sciences. 
Merit, indeed, meets in England with rewards: . 
of another kind, which redound more to the honor 
of the nation. The English have so great a vene- 
ration for exalted talents, that a man of merit in 
their country is always sure of making his for- 
tune. Mr, Addison in France would have been 
elected a member of one of the academies, and, 
by the eredit of some women, might have obtained 
a yearly pension of twelve hundred livres, or else 
might have been imprisoned in the Bastille, upon 
pretense that certain strokes in his tragedy of 
Cato had been discovered which glanced at the 
porter of some man in power. Mr. Addison was 
raised to the post of Secretary of State in Eng- 
land. Sir Isaae Newton was made Master of the 
Royal Mint. Mr. Congreve had a considerable 
employment. Mr. Prior was Plenipotentiary. Dr. 
Swift is Dean of St. Patrick’s in Dublin, and is 
more revered in Ireland than the Primate him- 
self. The religion which Mr. Pope professes * ex-

  eludes him, indeed, from preferments of every 
kind, but then it did not prevent his gaining two 
hundred thousand livres by his excellent trarsla- 
tion of Homer. I myself saw a long time in 
Franee the author of ‘‘Rhadamistus’’* ready to 
perish for hunger. And the son of one of the 
greatest men ovr country ever gave birth to, and 
who was beginning to run the noble career which 
his father had set him, would have been reduced 
to. the extremes of misery had he not been patron- 
ized by Monsieur Fagon. : 
But the cireumstance which mostly encourages 
the arts in England is the great veneration which 
is paid them. The picture of the Prime Minister 
hangs over the chimney of his own closet, but I 
have seen that of Mr. Pope in twenty noblemen’s 
houses. Sir Isaac Newton was revered in his life- 
time, and had a due respect paid to him after his 
death,—the greatest men in the nation disputing 
who should have the honor of holding up his pall. 
Go into Westminster Abbey, and you will find 
that what. raises the admiration of the spectator 
is not the mausoleums of the English kings, but 
the monuments which the gratitude of the nation 
has erected to perpetuate the memory of those 
illustrious men who contributed to its glory. We 
view their statues in that abbey in the same man- 
ner as those of Scphocles, Plato, and other im- 
mortal personages were viewed in Athens; andI - 
am persuaded that the bare sight of those glorious 
monuments has fired more than one breast, and 
been the occasion of their becoming great men. 
The English have even been reproached with 
«“Rhadamiste et Zénobis,” a tragedy by Orébillon (1711), 
who long suffered frem neglect and want.

  paying too extravagant honors to mere merit, and 
censured for interring the celebrated actress Mrs. 
Oldfield * in Westminster Abbey, with almost the 
same pomp as Sir Isaac Newton. Some pretend 
that the English had paid her these great funeral 
honors purposely to make us more strongly sen- 
sible of the barbarity and injustice which they 
cbject to in us, for having buried Mademoiselle 
Le Couvreur ignominiously in the fields. 
But be assured from me that the English were 
prompted by no other principle in burying Mrs. 
Oldfield in Westminster Abbey than their good 
sense. They are far from being so ridiculous as 
to brand with infamy an art which has immor- 
talized a Euripides and a Sophocles; or to ex- 
elude from the body of their citizens a set of 
people whose business is to set off with the utmost 
grace of speech and action those pieces which the 
nation is proud of. 
Under the reign of Charles I and in the be- 
ginning of the civil wars raised by a number of 
rigid fanatics, who at last were the victims to it, 
a great many pieces were published against the- 
atrical and other,shows, which were attacked with 
the greater virulence because that monarch and 
his queen, daughter to Henry I of France, were 
passionately fond of them. 
One Mr. Prynne, a man of most furiously 
scrupulous principles, who would have thought 
himself damned had he worn a cassock instead of 
5 Anne, or “Nance” Oldfield was born in 1683, and died 
im 1730. Her death occurred in the year which followed 
the close of Voltsire’s English visit. At her funeral, the body 
lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber of Westminster Abbey. 
She had @ natural son, who married Lady Mary Walpole, a 
natural daughter of Sir Robert Walpole, the Prime Minister.

of mankind cut the other to pieces for the glory 
of God and the Propaganda Fide, took it into his 
head to write a most wretched satire against some 
pretty good comedies, which were exhibited very 
innocently every night before their majesties. He 
quoted the authority of the Rabbis, and some pas- 
sages from St. Bonaventura, to prove that the 
‘*Qdipus’’ of Sophocles was the work of the evil 
spirit; that Terence was excommunicated ipso 
facto; and added that doubtless Brutus, who was 
@ very severe Jansenist, assassinated Julius Cesar 
for no other reason but because he, who was 
Pontifex Maximus, presumed to write a tragedy 
the subject of which was ‘‘Cipidus.’’ Lastly, he 
declared that all who frequented the theater were 
excommunicated, as they thereby renounced their 
baptism. This was casting the highest insult on 
the king and all the royal family; and as the 
English loved their prince at that time, they could 
not bear to hear a writer talk of excommunicating 
him, tho they themselves afterward cut his head 
off. Prynne was summoned to appear before the 
Star Chamber; his wonderful book, from which 
‘Father Lebrun stole his, was sentenced to be 
‘burned by the common hangman, and himself to 
lose his ears.’ His trial is now extant.

the cause of the king. .Later, in the Cromwellian period, he 
was arrested and again imprisoned, but was released in 
1652, and, after the accession of Charles II, was made 
keeper of the records in the Tewer.

ceive salaries from the king; that we condemn as

Louis XIV and Louis XV performed as actors; 
that we give the title of the devil’s works to 
pieces which are received by magistrates of the 
most severe character, and represented before a 
virtuous queen; when, I say, foreigners are told 
of this insolent conduct, this contempt for the 
royal authority, and this Gothic rusticity which 
some presume to call Christian severity, what idea 
must they entertain of our nation? And how will 
it be possible for them to conceive, either that our 
laws give a sanction to an art which is declared 
infamous, or that some persons dare to stamp 
with’ infamy an art which receives a sanction 
from the laws, is rewarded. by kings, cultivated 
and encouraged by the greatest men, and admired 
by whole nations? And that Father Lebrun’s im-

I wiut confess that the majesty of the Serip-

the Gospel hath its influence on my heart. Peruse 
the works of our philosophers with all their pomp 
of diction; how mean, how contemptible are they 
compared with the Seriptures! Is it possible that. 
a book, at once so simple and sublime, should be 
merely the work of man? Is it possible that the 
sacred personage, whose history it contains, 
should be himself a mere man? Do we find that 
He assumed the tone of an enthusiast or ambi- 
tious sectary? What sweetness, what purity in 
His manner! What an affecting gracefulness 
in His delivery! What sublimity in His maxims! 
what profound wisdom in His discourses? What 
presence of mind, what subtlety, what truth in

  His replies!. How great the command over His 
passions! Where is the man, where the philos- 
opher, who could so live, and so die, without 
weakness, and without ostentation? When Plato 
described his imaginary good man loaded with 
all the shame of guilt, yet meriting the highest 
rewards of virtue, he describes exactly the char- 
acter. of Jesus Christ: the resemblance was so 
striking that all the Fathers perceived it. 
What prepossession, what blindness must it be 
to compare the son. of Sophronicus to the son 
of Mary!. What an infinite disproportion there 
is between them! Socrates dying without pain 
or ignominy, easily supported his character to 
the last; and if his death, however easy, had not 
crowned his life, it might have been doubted 
whether Socrates, with all his wisdom, was any- 
thing more. than a vain sophist. He invented, 
it is said, the theory of morals. Others, however, 
had before put them in practise; he had only 
to say, therefore, what they had done, and to 
reduce their examples to precepts. Aristides had 
been. just before Socrates defined justice; Leoni- 
das had given up his life for his country before 
Socrates declared patriotism to be a duty; the 
Spartans were a sober people before Socrates 
recommended sobriety; before he had even de- 
fined virtue Greece abounded in virtuous men. 
But where could Jesus learn, among His com- 
petitors, that pure and sublime morality, of which 
He only hath given us both precept and example? 
The greatest wisdom was made known amongst 
the most bigoted fanaticism, and the simplicity 
of the most heroie virtues did honor to the vilest 
people on earth. The death of Socrates, peace-

  ably philosophizing with his friends, appears the 
most agreeable that could be wished for; that of 
Jesus, expiring in the midst of agonizing pains, 
abused, insulted, and accused by a whale nation, 
is the most horrible that could be feared. 
Socrates, in receiving the cup of poison, blest, 
indeed, the weeping executioner who administered 
it; but Jesus, in the midst of exeruciating tor- 
ments, prayed for His merciless tormentors. Yes, 
if the life and death of Socrates were those of 
a sage, the life and death of Jesus are those of 
a God. Shall we suppose the evangelic history 
a mere fiction? Indeed, my friend, it bears not 
the marks of fiction; on the contrary, the history 
of Socrates, which nobody presumes to doubt, 
is not so we attested as that of Jesus Christ. 
Such a supposition, in fact, only shifts the dif- 
ficulty without obviating it: it is more incon- 
eceivable that a number of persons should agree 
to write such a history, than that one only should 
furnish the subject of it. The Jewish authors 
were incapable of the diction, and strangers te 
the morality contained in the Gospel, the marks 
of whose truth are so striking and inimitable 
thet the inventor. would be a more astonishing 
character than the hero.

OF THE MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN* 
I wave thought that the most essential part 
in the education of children, and which is seldom 
regarded in the best families, is to make them 
sensible of their inability, weakness, and de- 
pendence, and, as my husband called it, the 
heavy yoke of that necessity which nature has 
imposed upon our species; and that, not only 
in order to show them how much is done to 
alleviate the burden of that yoke, but especially 
to instruct them betimes in what rank Providence 
has placed them, that they may not presume too 
far above themselves, or be ignorant of the 
reciprocal duties of humanity. 
Young people who from their cradle have been 
brought up in ease and effeminacy, who have 
been caressed by every one, indulged in all their 
eaprices,- and have been used to obtain easily 
everything they desired, enter upon the world 
with many impertinent prejudices; of which they 
are generally cured by frequent mortifications, 
affronts, and chagrin. Now, I would willingly | 
spare my children this kind of education by 
giving them, at first, a just notion of things. 
I had indeed onee resolved to indulge my eldest 
son in everything he wanted, from a persuasion 
that the first impulses #f nature must be good

  and salutary; but I was not long in discovering that 
children, conceiving from such treatment that 
they have a right to be obeyed, depart from a 
: state of nature almost as soon. as born—con- 
: tracting our vices from our example, and theirs 
by our indiscretion. I saw that if.I indulged 
him in all his humors they would only inerease 
by such indulgence; that it was necessary to 
stop at some point, and that contradiction would 
be but the more mortifying as he should be 
less accustomed to it; but, that it might be less 
painful to him, I began to use it upon him by 
degrees, and in order to prevent his tears and 
lamentations I made every denial irrevocable. 
It is true, I contradict him as little as possible, 
and never without due consideration. Whatever 
is given or permitted him is done unconditionally 
and at the first instance; and in this we are 
indulgent enough; but he never gets anything 
by importunity, neither his tears nor entreaties 
being of any effect. Of this he is now so well 
convinced that he makes no use of them; he 
goes his way on the first word, and frets himself 
no more at seeing a box of sweetmeats taken 
away from him than at seeing a bird fly away 
which he would be glad to catch, there appearing 
to him the same impossibility of having the one 
as the other; and, so far from beating the chairs 
and tables, he dares not lift his hand against 
those who oppose him. In everything that dis- 
pleases him he feels. the weight of necessity, the 
effect of his own weakness. 
The great cause of the ill humor of children 
is the care which is taken either to quiet 
or to aggravate them. They will sometimes ery 
174
-P-A-G-E-186
  JEAN JACQUES ROUSSEAU 
  for an hour for no other reason in the world 
than because they perceive we would not have 
them. So long as we take notice of their crying, 
so long have they a reason for continuing to 
ery; but they will soon give over of themselves 
when they see no notice is taken of them; for, 
old or young, nobody loves to throw away his 
trouble. This is exactly the case with my eldest 
boy, who was once the most peevish little bawler, 
stunning the whole house with his cries; whereas 
now you can hardly hear there is a child in the 
house. He cries, indeed, when he is in pain; 
but then it is the voice of nature, which should 
never be restrained; and he is again hushed as 
soon as ever the pain is over. For this reason 
I pay great attention to his tears, as I am 
certain he never sheds them for nothing; and 
hence I have gained the advantage of being cer- 
tain when he is in pain and when not; when 
he is well and when sick; an advantage which 
is lost with those who ery out of mere humor 
and only in order to be appeased. I must con- 
fess, however, that this management is not to 
be expected from nurses and governesses; for 
as nothing is more tiresome than to hear a child 
ery, and as these good women think of nothing 
but the time present, they do not foresee that 
by quieting it to-day it will ery the more to- 
morrow. But, what is still worse, this indulgence 
produces an obstinacy which is of more con- 
sequence as the child grows up. The very cause 
that makes it a squaller at three years of age 
will make it stubborn and refractory at twelve, 
quarrelsome at twenty, imperious and insolent 
at thirty, and insupportable all its life.

  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  In every indulgence granted te children they 
ean easily see our desire to please them, and 
therefore they should be taught to suppose we 
have reason for refusing or complying with their 
requests. This is another advantage gained by 
making use of authority, rather than persuasion, 
on every necessary occasion. For, as it is im- 
possible they ean be always blind to our motives, 
it is natural for them to imagine that we have 
some reason for contradicting them, of which 
they are ignorant. On the contrary, when we 
have once submitted to their judgment, they will 
pretend to judge of everything, and thus become 
cunning, deceitful, fruitful in shifts and chica- 
nery, endeavoring to silence those who are weak 
enough to argue with them; for when one is 
obliged to give them an account of things above 
their comprehension, they attribute the most 
prudent conduct to eaprice, beeanse they are 
ineapable of understanding it. In a word, the 
only way to render children docile and capable 
of reasoning is not to reason with them at all, 
but to convince them that it is above their 
childish capacities; for they will always suppose 
the argument in their favor unless you ean give 
them good cause to think otherwise. They know 
very well that we are unwilling to displease them, 
when they are certain of our affection; and chil- 
dren are seldom mistaken in this particular: 
therefore, if I deny anything to my children, 
I never reason with them, I never tell them why 
I do so and so; but I endeavor, as much as 
possible, that they should find it out, and that 
even after the affair is over. By these means 
they are accustomed to think that I never deny

  them anything without a sufficient reason, tho. 
they can not always see it. - 
On the same principle it is that I never suffer 
my children to join in the conversation of grown: 
people, or foolishly imagine themselves on an 
equality with them, because they are permitted 
to prattle. I would have them give a short and 
modest answer when they are spoken to, but. 
never to speak of their own head, or ask imper-. 
tinent qnestions of persons so much older thaw 
themselves, to whom they ought to show more 
respect. . . . 1 
‘What can a child think of himself when he

turn the head of a grown person; judge, then, 
what effect it must have upon that of a child. 
Tt is with the prattle of children as with-the

if, amidst such a number of idle words, chance 
did not now and then jumble some of them inte

MADAME DE STAEL 
Born in Paris, 1763, died there in 1817; daughter of 
Necker, the Minister of Finance, and Susanne Courchod, the 
sweetheart of Gibbon; married to the Baron of Stuél-Hol- 
stein, the Swedish ambassador to France, in 1786; lived in 
Germany in 1803-04; traveled in Italy in 1805; published 
“Oorinne” in 1807; returned to Germany in 1808; and 
finished ‘De I’ Allemagne,” the first edition of which was de- 
stroyed, probably ,at the instigation of Napoleon, who became 
her bitter enemy; exiled from France by Napoleon in 1812-14. 
OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE* 
Genera Bonaparte made himself as conspicu- 
ous by his character and his intellect as by his 
victories; and the imagination of the French 
began to be touched by him [1797]. His proc- 
Jamations to the Cisalpine and Ligurian repub- 
‘lies were talked of. . . . A tone of modera- 
tion and of dignity pervaded his style, which 
contrasted with the revolutionary harshness of 
the civil rulers of France. The warrior spoke 
in those days like a lawgiver, while the lawgivers 
exprest themselves with soldier-like violence. 
General Bonaparte had not executed in his army 
the decrees against the émigrés. It was said that 
he loved his wife, whose character is full of 
1¥rom “Considerations on the French Revolution.” This 
work was not published until 1818, three years after the 
exile of Napoleon to St. Helena. An English translation 
appeared in 1819. |

  sweetness; it was asserted that he felt the beau- 
ties of Ossian; it was a pleasure to attribute 
to him all the generous qualities that form a noble 
background for extraordinary abilities, . . . 
Such at least was my own mood when I saw 
him for the first time in Paris. I could find no 
words with which to reply to him when he came 
to me to tell me that he had tried to visit. my 
father at Coppet, and that he was sorry to have 
passed through Switzerland without seeing him. 
But when I had somewhat recovered from the 
agitation of admiration, it was followed by a 
feeling of very marked fear. Bonaparte then 
had no power: he was thought even to be more 
or Jess in danger from the vague suspiciousness 
of the Directory; so that the fear he inspired 
was caused only by the singular effect of his 
personality upon almost every one who had in- 
tercourse with him. I had seen men worthy of 
high respect; I had also seen ferocious men: 
there was nothing in the impression Bonaparte 
produeed upon me which could remind me of 
men of either type. I soon perceived, on the 
different occasions when I met him during his 
stay in Paris, that his character could not be 
defined by the words we are accustomed to make 
use of: he was neither kindly nor violent, neither 
gentle nor eruel, after the fashion of other men. 
Such a being, so unlike others, could neither 
excite nor feel sympathy: he was more or less 
than man. His bearing, his mind, his language 
have the marks of a foreigner’s nature—an 
advantage the more in subjugating French- 
men... . 
Far from being reassured by seemg Bonaparte 
179

  often, he always intimidated me more and more. 
i felt vaguely that no emotional feeling could 
influence him. He regards a human ereature as 
a fact or a thing, but not as an existence like 
his own. He feels no more hate than love. For 
him there is no one but himself: all other crea- 
tures are mere ciphers. The force of his will 
consists in the imperturbable calculations of his 
egotism: he is an able chess-player whose op- 
ponent is all humankind, whom he intends to 
checkmate. His success is due as much to the 
qualities he lacks as to the talents he possesses, 
Neither pity, nor sympathy, nor religion, nor 
attachment to any idea whatsoever would have 
power to turn him from his path. He has the 
same devotion to his own interests that a good 
man has to virtue: if the object were noble, his 
persistency would be admirable. 
Every time that I heard him talk I was struek 
by his superiority; it was of a kind, however, 
that had no relation to that of men instructed 
and cultivated by study, or by society, such as 
England and France possess examples of. But 
his conversation indicated that. quick perception 
of cireumstances the hunter has in pursuing his 
prey. Sometimes he related the political and 
military events of his life in a very interesting 
manner; he had even, in narratives that admitted 
gaiety, a touch of Italian imagination. Nothing, 
however, eould conquer my invincible alienation 
from what I perceived in him. I saw in his 
soul a cold and cutting sword, which froze while 
wounding; I saw in his mind a profound irony, 
from which nothing fine or noble could escape, 
not even his own glory: for he despised the na-

tion whose suffrages he desired; and no spark 
of enthusiasm mingled with his eraving to as- 
tonish the human race. . . : 
His face, thin and pale at that time, was very 
agreeable: since then he has gained flesh—which 
does not become him; for one needs to believe 
such a man to be tormented by his own char- 
acter, at all to tolerate the sufferings this char- 
acter causes others. As his stature is short, 
and yet his waist very long, he appeared to much 
greater advantage on horseback than on foot; 
in all ways it is war, and war only, he is fitted 
for. His manner in society is constrained with- 
out being timid; it is disdainful when he is on 
his guard, and vulgar when he is at ease; his air 
of disdain suits him best, and so he is not sparing 
in the use of it. He took pleasure already in 
the part of embarrassing people by saying dis- 
agreeable things: an art which he has since made 
a system of, as of all other methods of sub- 
jugating men by degrading them.

IN AN AMERICAN FOREST* 
Wuen, in my journeys among the Indian tribes 
of Canada, I left European dwellings, and found 
myself, for the first time, alone in the midst of 
an ocean of forests, having, so to speak, all 
nature prostrate at my feet, a strange change 
took place within me. In the kind of delirium 
which seized me, I followed no road; I went 
from tree to tree, now to the right, now to the 
left, saying to myself, ‘‘Here there are no more

Chateaubriand visited Canada, traveling inland through the

  roads to follow, no-more towns, no more narrow 
houses, no more presidents, republics, or kings— 
above. all, no more laws, and no more men.’’? Men! 
Yes, some good savages, who cared nothing for 
mie, nor I for them; who, like me, wandered 
freely wherever their fancy led them, eating 
when they felt inclined, sleeping when and where 
they pleased. And, in order to see if I were 
really established in my original rights, I gave 
myself up to a thousand acts of eccentricity, 
which enraged the tall Dutchman who was my 
guide, and who, in his heart, thought I was mad. 
Escaped from the tyrannous yoke of society, 
I understood then the charms of that independ- 
ence of nature which far surpasses all the pleas- 
ures of which civilized man ean form any idea, 
I understood why not one savage has become a 
European, and why many Europeans have become 
savages; why the sublime ‘‘Discourse on_ the 
Inequality of Rank’’ is so little understood by 
the most part of our philosophers. It is inered- 
ible how small and diminished the nations and 
their most boasted institutions appeared in my 
eyes; it seemed to me as if I saw the kingdoms 
of the earth through an inverted ‘spy-glass, or 
rather that, being myself grown and elevated, 
I looked down on the rest of my degenerate race 
with the eye of a giant. 
You who wish to write about men, go into. the 
deserts, become for a moment the child of nature, 
and then—and then only—take up the pen. 
Among the innumerable enjoyments of this 
journey one especially made a vivid impression 
on my mind. 
I was going then to see the famous cataract 
183
-P-A-G-E-195
  
THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  of Niagara, and I had taken my way through 
the Indian tribes who inhabit the deserts to the 
west of the American plantations. My guides 
were—the sun, a pocket-compass, and the Dutch- 
man of whom I have spoken: the latter under- 
steod perfectly five dialects of the Huron lan- 
guage. Our train consisted of two horses, which 
we let loose in the forests at night, after fast- 
ening a bell to their necks. I was at first a 
little afraid of losing them, but my guide. re- 
assured me by pointing out that, by a wonderful 
instinet, these good animals never wandered out 
of sight of our fire. 
One evening, when, as we calculated that we 
were only about eight or nine leagues from the 
cataract, we were preparing to dismount before 
sunset, in order to build our hut and light our 
watch-fire after the Indian fashion, we perceived 
in the wood the fires of some savages who were 
encamped a little lower down on the shores of 
the same stream as we were. We went to them. 
The Dutchman having by my orders asked their 
permission for us to pass the night with them, 
which was granted immediately, we set to work 
with our hosts. After having cut down some 
branches, planted some stakes, torn off some bark 
to cover our palace, and performed some other 
publie offices, each of us attended to his own 
affairs. I brought my saddle, which served me 
well for a pillow all through my travels; the 
guide rubbed down the horses; and as to his 
night accommodation, since he was not so par- 
tienlar as I am, he generally made use of the 
dry trunk of a tree. Work being done, we 
seated ourselves in a cirele, with our legs crossed

  like tailors, around the immense fire, to reast 
our heads of maize, and to prepare supper. I 
had still a flask of brandy, which served to 
enliven our savages not a little. They found 
out that they had some bear hams, and we began 
a royal feast. 
The family consisted of two women, with in- 
fants at their breasts, and three warriors; two 
of them might be from forty to forty-five years 
of age, altho they appeared much older, and the 
third was a young man. 
The conversation soon became general; that 
is to say, on my side it consisted of broken words 
and many gestures~——-an expressive language, 
which these nations understand remarkably well, 
and that I had learned among them. The young 
man alone preserved an obstinate silence; he 
kept his eyes constantly fixt on me. In spite 
of the black, red, and blue stripes, cut ears, and 
the pearl hanging from his nose, with which 
he was disfigured, it was easy to see the nobility 
and sensibility which animated his countenance. 
How well I knew he was inclined not to love 
me! It seemed to me as if he were reading in 
his heart the history of all the wrongs which 
Europeans have inflicted on his native country. 
The two children, quite naked, were asleep at 
our feet before the fire; the women took them 
quietly into their arms and put them to bed 
among the skins, with a mother’s tenderness so 
delightful to witness in these so-called savages: 
the conversation died away by degrees, and eack 
fell asleep in. the place where he was. 
I alone could not close my eyes, hearing on 
all sides the deep breathing of my hosts. I raised 
185

  my head, and, supporting ‘myself on my elbow, 
watched by the red light of the expiring fire 
the Indians stretched around me and plunged in 
sleep. I confess that I could hardly refrain 
from tears. Brave youth, how your peaceful 
sleep affeets me! You, who seemed so sensible 
of the woes of your native land, you were too 
great, too high-minded to mistrust the foreigner! 
Europeans, what a lesson for you! These same 
savages whom we have pursued with fire and 
sword, to whom our avarice would not leave a 
spadeful of earth to cover their corpses in all 
this world, formerly their vast patrimony—these 
same savages receiving their enemy into their 
hospitable hut, sharing with him their. miserable 
meal, and, their’ couch undisturbed by remorse, 
sleeping close to him the calm sleep of the in- 
nocent. These virtues are as munch above the 
virtues of conventional life as the soul of the 
man in his natural state is above that of the 
man in society. . . 
It was moonlight. Feverish with thinking, I 
got up and seated myself at a little distance on 
a root which ran along the edge of the stream- 
let: it was one ef those American nights which 
the pencil of man can never represent, and the 
remembrance of which I have a hundred times 
recalled with delight. . 
The moon was at the highest point of the 
heavens; here and there at wide, clear intervals 
twinkled a thousand stars. Sometimes the moon 
rested on a group of clouds whieh’ looked like 
the summit of high mountains crowned with 
snow: little by little these clouds grew longer, 
and rolled out into transparent and waving zones

  of white.satin, or transformed themselves into 
light flakes of froth, into innumerable wandering 
flocks in the blue plains of the firmament. An- 
other time the arch of heaven seemed changed 
into a shore on which one could discover hori- 
zontal rows, parallel lines such as are made by 
the regular ebb and flow of the sea; a gust of 
wind tore this veil: again, and everywhere ap- 
peared in the sky great banks of dazzlingly white 
down, so soft to the eye that one seemed to feel 
their softness and elasticity. The scene on the 
earth was not less delightful: the silvery and 
velvety light of the moon floated silently over 
the top of the forests, and at intervals went 
down among the trees, casting rays of light even 
through the deepest shadows. The narrow brook 
which flowed at my feet, burying itself from time 
to time among the thickets of oak-, willow-, and 
sugar-trees, and reappearing a little farther off 
in the glades, all sparkling with the constella- 
tions of the night, seemed like a ribbon of azure 
silk spotted with diamond stars and striped with 
black bands. On the other side of the river, in 
a wide, natural meadow, the moonlight rested 
quietly on the pastures, where it was spread out 
like a sheet. Some birch-trees scattered here and 
there over the savannas, sometimes blending, ac- 
cording to the caprice of the winds, with the 
background, seemed to surround themselves with 
a pale gauze—sometimes rising up again from 
their chalky foundations, hidden in the dark- 
ness, formed, as it were, islands of floating 
shadows on an immovable sea of light. Near 
all was silence and repose, except the falling of 
the leaves, the rough passing of a sudden wind, 
187
-P-A-G-E-199
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  the rare and interrupted whooping of the gray 
owl; but in the distance at intervals one heard 
the solemn rolling of the cataract of Niagara, 
which in the calm of the night echoed from 
desert to desert and died away in solitary forests. 
The grandeur, the astonishing melancholy of 
this picture can not be exprest in human lan- 
guage: the most beautiful nights in Europe can 
give no idea of it. In the midst of our cultivated 
fields the imagination vainly seeks to expand 
itself; everywhere it meets with the dwellings 
of man; but in these desert countries the soul 
delights in penetrating and losing itself in these 
eternal forests; it loves to wander by the light 
of the moon on the borders of immense lakes, 
' to hover over the roaring gulf of terrible cat- 
aracts, to fall with the masses of water, and, 
so to speak, mix and blend itself with a sublime 
and savage nature. These enjoyments are too 
keen; such is our weakness that exquisite pleas- 
ures become griefs, as if nature feared that we 
should forget that we are men. Absorbed in 
‘my existence, or rather drawn quite out of myself, 
having neither feeling nor distinct thought, but 
an indesertbable I know not what, which was 
like that happiness which they say we shall enjoy 
in the other life, I was all at once recalled to 
this. I felt unwell, and perceived that I must 
not linger. I returned to our encampment, where, 
lying down by the savages, I soon fell into a 
deep sleep.

SHAKESPEARE AS AN EXAMPLE OF 
CIVILIZATION * 
Vouraire was the first person in France whe 
spoke of Shakespeare’s genius;" and altho he 
spoke of him merely as a barbarian genius, the 
French public were of opinion that Voltaire had 
said too much in his favor. Indeed, they thought 
it nothing less than profanation to apply the 
words ‘fgenius’’? and ‘‘glory’’ to dramas which 
they considered as crude as they were coarse. 
At the present day all. controversy regarding 
Shakespeare’s genius and glory has come to an 
end. No one ventures any longer to dispute 
them; but a greater question has arisen—namely, 
1¥rom “Shakespeare and His Times.” 
2 Voltsire’s references to Shakespeare were made in his 
“Letters on England.” From them dates the beginning of 
French interest in the English poet. 
189

  whether Shakespeare’s dramatic system is not far 
superior to that of Voltaire. This question I 
‘do not presume to decide. I merely say that it 
is now open for discussion. We have been led 
to it by the onward progress of ideas. I shall 
endeavor to point out the -causes .which have 
brought it about; but at present I insist merely 
upon the fact itself, and deduce from it one 
simple consequence, that literary criticism has 
ehanged its ground, and can no longer remain 
restricted to the limits within which it was for- 
merly confined. 
Literature does not escape from the revolutions 
of the human mind; it is compeHed to follow it 
in its course, to transport itself beneath the 
horizon under which it is conveyed, to gain eleva- 
tion and extension with the ideas which oceupy 
its notice, and to consider the questions which 
it discusses under the new aspects and novel 
circumstances in which they are placed by the 
new state of thought and of society. . 
When we embrace human destiny in all. its 
aspects, and human nature in all the conditions 
of man upon earth, we enter into possession of 
an exhaustless treasure. It is the peculiar ad- 
vantage of such a system that it escapes, by its 
extent, from the dominion of any particular 
genius. We may discover its principles in Shake- 
speare’s works; but he was not fully aequainted 
with them, nor did he always respect them. He 
should serve as an example, not as a model. 
Some men, even of superior talent, have at- 
tempted to write plays according to Shake- 
speare’s taste, without perceiving that they were 
deficient in one important qualification for the task; 
190
-P-A-G-E-202
  FRANCOIS GUIZOT 
  and that-was to wnte as he did, to write them for 
our age just as Shakespeare’s plays were written 
for the age in which he lived. This is an enterprise 
the difficulties of which have, hitherto, perhaps, 
been maturely considered by no one. 
We have seen how much art and effort were 
employed by Shakespeare io surmount those 
which are inherent in his system. They are still 
greater in our times, and would unveil themselves 
much more completely to the spirit of criticism 
which now aécompanies the boldest essays of 
genius. It is not only with spectators of more 
fastidious taste and of more idle and inattentive 
imagination that the poet would have to do who 
should venture to follow in Shakespeare’s foot- 
steps. He would be called upon to give move- 
ment to personages embarrassed in much more 
complicated interests, preoccupied with much 
more various feelings, and subject to less simple 
habits of mind and to less decided tendencies. 
Neither science, nor reflection, nor the scruples 
of conscience, nor the uncertainties of thought 
frequently encumber Shakespeare’s heroes; doubt 
is of little use among them, and the violence of 
their passions speedily transfers their belief to 
the side of the desires, or sets their actions above 
their belief. Hamlet alone presents the confused 
spectacle of 2 mind formed by the enlightenment 
of society in conflict with a position contrary to 
its laws; and he needs a supernatural apparition 
to determine him to act, and a fortuitous event 
to accomplish his project. If incessantly placed 
in an analogous postion, the personages of a 
tragedy conceived at the present day according 
to the romantic system would offer us the same 
191
-P-A-G-E-203

THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASS nT 
picture of indecision. Ideas now crowd and in- 
tersect each other in the mind of man, duties 
multiply in his conscience and obstacles” and 
bonds around his Hife. Instead of those electric 
brains, prompt to communicate the spark which 
they have received; instead of those ardent and 
simple-minded men, whose projects like Mac- 
beth’s ‘‘will to hand’’—the world now presents 
to the poet minds like Hamlet’s, deep in the 
observation of thgse inward conflicts which our 
classical system has derived from a state of 
society more advanced than that of the time in 
which Shakespeare lived. So many feelings, in- 
terests, and ideas, the necessary consequences of 
modern civilization, might become even in their 
simplest form of expression a troublesome bur- 
den, which it would be difficult to carry through 
the rapid evolutions and bold advances of the 
romantic system. 
We must, however, satisfy every demand; suc- 
cess itself requires it. The reason must be con- 
tented at the same time that the imagination 
is oceupied. The progress of taste, of enlighten- 
ment, of society, and of mankind, must serve 
not to diminish or disturb our enjoyment, but 
to render them worthy of ourselves and eapable 
of supplying the new wants which we have con- 
tracted. Advance without rule and art in the 
* romantie system, and you will produce melo- 
dramas calenlated to. excite a-passing émotion 
in the multitude, but in the multitude alone, and 
for a few days; just as by dragging along with- 
out originality in the classical system you will 
satisfy only that cold literary class who are ac- 
quainted with nothing in nature which is more

  important than the interests of versification, or 
more imposing than the three unities. This is 
not the work of the poet who is called to power 
and destined for glory: he acts upon a grander 
seale, and ean address the superior intellects as 
well as the general and simple faculties of all 
men. It is doubtless necessary that the crowd 
should throng to behold those dramatic works of 
which you desire to make a national spectacle; 
but do not hope to become national, if you do 
not unite in your festivities all those classes of 
persons and minds whose well-arranged hierarchy 
raises a nation to its loftiest dignity. Genius 
is bound to follow human nature in all its de- 
velopments; its strength consists in finding within 
itself the means for constantly satisfying the 
whole of the public. The same task is now 
imposed upon government and upon poetry: both 
should exist for all, and suffice at once for the 
wants of the masses and for the requirements 
of the most exalted minds. 
Doubtless stopt in its course by these condi- 
tions, the full severity of which will only be 
revealed to the talent that can comply with them, 
dramatic art, even in England, where under the 
protection of Shakespeare it would have liberty 
to attempt anything, scarcely ventures at the 
present day even to iry timidly to follow ‘him. 
Meanwhile England, France, and the whole of 
Europe demand of the drama pleasures and 
emotions that can no longer be supplied by the 
inanimate representation of a world that has 
ceased to exist. The classical system had its 
origin in the life of its time: that time has 
passed; its image subsists in brilliant colors in

the monuments of past ages, the monuments of 
another. age are now beginning to arise. - What 
will be their form? I can not tell; but the 
ground upon which their foundations may rest 
is already perceptible. 
This ground is not the ground of Corneille 
and Racine, nor is it that of Shakespeare; it is 
our own; but Shakespeare’s system, as it appears 
to me, may furnish the plans according to whieh 
genius ought now to work. This system alone 
includes all those social conditions and all those 
general or diverse feelings, the simultaneous con- 
junction and activity of which constitute for us 
at the present day the spectacle of human things. 
Witnesses during thirty years of the greatest 
revolutions of society, we shall no longer willingly 
confine the movement of our mind within the 
narrow space of some family event, or the 
agitations of a purely individual passion. The 
nature and destiny of man have appeared to us 
under their most striking and their simplest 
aspect, in all their extent and in all their vari- 
ableness. We require pictures in which this spec- 
tacle is reproduced, in which man is displayed 
in his completeness and excites our entire sym- 
pathy.

ALPHONSE DE LAMARTINE 
Born in 1790, died in 1869; famous chiefly as a poet, being 
one of the greatest in modern France, but successful as an 
orator and prominent in political lite during the troubled 
period of 1848, when he was Minister of Foreign Affairs; 
author of several historical works, among them the ‘‘History 
of the Girondista.” 
OF MIRABEAU’S ORIGIN AND PLACE IN 
HISTORY* 
He was born a gentleman and of ancient line- 
age, refugees established in Provence, but of 
Italian origin. The progenitors were Tuscan. 
The family was one of those whom Florence had 
east from her bosom in the stormy excesses. of 
her liberty, and for which Dante reproaches his 
country in such bitter strains for her exiles and 
prosecutions. The blood of Machiavelli and the 
earthquake genius of the Italian republics were 
characteristics of all the individuals of this race. 
The proportions of their souls exceed the height 
of their destiny: vices, passions, virtues are all 
in excess. The women are all angelic or per- 
verse, the men sublime or depraved, and their 
language even is as emphatic and lofty as their 
aspirations. There is in their most familiar cor- 
respondence the color and tone of the heroic 
tongues of Italy.

The ancestors of Mirabeau speak of their 
domestic affairs as Plutarch of the quarrels of 
Marius and Sulla, of Cesar and .Pompey. | We 
perceive the great men descending to trifling 
matters. Mirabeau inspired this domestic maj- 
esty and virility in his very cradle. I dwell 
on these details, which may seem foreign to this 
history, but they explain it. The source of 
genius is often in ancestry, and the blood of 
descent is sometimes the propheey of destiny. 
Mirabeau’s education was as rough and rude 
as the hand of his father, who was styled the 
friend of man, but whose restless spirit and 
selfish vanity rendered him the persecntor of 
his wife and the tyrant of all his family. The 
only virtue he was taught was honor, for by that 
name in those days they dignified that cere- 
monious demeanor which was too frequently only 
the show of probity and the elegance of vice. 
Entering the army at an early age, he acquired 
nothing of military habits except a love of licen- 
tiousness and play. The hand of bis father was 
constantly extended not to aid him in rising, 
but to depress him still lower under the con- 
sequences of his errors. His youth was passed 
in the prisons of the state, where his passions, 
becoming envenomed by solitude, and his intellect 
rendered more acute by contact with the irons 
of his dungeon, his mind lost that modesty which 
rarely survives the infamy of precocious pun- 
ishments. 
Released from jail, in order, by his father’s 
command, to attempt to form a marriage beset 
with difficulties with Mademoiselle de Marignan, 
a rich heiress of one of the greatest families of

  Provence, he displayed, like a wrestler, all kinds 
of stratagems and daring schemes of policy in 
the small theater of Aix. Not only cunning, 
seduction, and courage, but every resource of 
his nature was used to succeed, and he suc- 
ceeded; but he was hardly married before fresh 
persecutions beset him, and the stronghold of 
Pontarlier gaped to enclose him. A love, which 
his ‘‘Lettres &,Sophie’’ has rendered immortal, 
opened its gates and freed him. He earried off 
Madame de Monier from her aged husband. The 
lovers, happy for some months, took refuge in 
Holland; they were seized there, separated and 
shut up, the one in a convent and the other in 
the dungeon of Vincennes. 
Love, which, like fire in the veins of the earth, 
is always detected in some crevice of man’s des- 
tiny, lighted up in a single and ardent blaze all 
the passions of Mirabeau. In his vengeance it 
was outraged love that he appeased; in liberty 
it was love which he sought and which delivered 
him; in study it was love which still illustrated 
his path. Entering his cell an obscure man, he 
quitted it a writer, orator, statesman, but per- 
verted—ripe for anything, even ready to sell 
himself, in order to buy fortune and celebrity. 
The drama of life had been conceived in his 
head; he wanted only the stage, and that was 
being prepared for him by time. During the 
few short years which elapsed between his leaving 
the keep of Vincennes and the tribune of the 
National Assembly, he employed himsel:’ with 
polemic labors which would have weighed jown 
another man, but which only kept Mirabeav in 
health. Such topics as the bank of Saint Charles,

the institutions of Holland, the books.on Prussia, 
with Beaumarchais (his style and character), with 
lengthened pleadings on questions of warfare, 
the balance of European power, finance, leading 
to biting invectives and wars of words with the 
ministers of the hour, made scenes that resembled. 
those in the Roman forum of the days of Clodius 
and Cicero. We discern the men of antiquity 
even in his most modern controversies. We may 
hear the first roarings or popular tumults which 
were so soon to burst forth, and which his voice 
was destined to control. 
At the first election of Aix, when rejected 
with contempt by the noblesse, he cast himself 
into the arms of the people, certain of making 
‘the balance incline to the side on which he should 
east the weight of his daring and his genius. 
Marseilles contended with Aix for the great ple- 
beian; his two elections, the discourses he then 
delivered, the addresses he drew up, the energy 
he employed commanded the attention of all 
France. His sonorous phrases became the prov- 
erbs of the Revolution. Comparing himself, in 
his lofty language, to the men of antiquity, he 
placed himself already in the public estimation 
in the elevated position he aspired to reach. Men 
became accustomed to identify him with the 
names he cited; he made a loud noise in order 
to prepare minds for great commotions; he an- 
nounced himself proudly to the nation, in that 
sublime apostrophe in his address to the Mar- 
seillais: ‘‘When the last of the Gracchi expired, 
he flung dust toward heaven, and from this dust 
sprang Marius!—Marius, who was less great for 
having exterminated the Cimbri than for having 
198

ALPHONSE DE LAMARTINE 
  prostrated in Rome the aristoeracy of the no- 
bility.” 
From the moment of his entry into the Na- 
tional Assembly Mirabeau filled it: he became 
the whole people. His gestures were commands; 
his movements coups d’état. He placed himself 
on a level with the throne, and the nobility itself 
felt itself subdued by a power emanating from 
its own body. The clergy, aid the people, with 
their desires to reconcile democracy with the 
church, lent him their influence, in order to 
destroy the double aristocracy of the nobility 
and bishops. 
All that had been built by antiquity and ce- 
mented by ages fell in a few months. Mirabeau 
alone preserved his presenve of mind in the midst 
of ruin. His character of tribune then ceased, 
that of the statesman began, and in this part he 
was even greater than in the-other. There, when 
all else crept and crawled, he acted with firm- 
ness, advancing boldly. The Revolution in his 
brain was no longer a momentary idea—it became 
a settled plan. The philosophy of the eighteenth 
century, moderated by the prudence of. policy, 
flowed easily from his lips. His eloquence, im- 
perative as the law, was now a talent for giving 
foree to reason. His language lighted and in- 
spired everything; and tho almost alone at this 
moment, he had the courage to remain alone. 
He braved envy, hatred, murmurs, supported as 
he was by a strong feeling of his superiority. 
He dismissed with disdain the passions which 
had hitherto beset him. He would no longer 
serve them when his cause no longer needed them. 
He spoke to men now only in the name of his 
199

genius, a title which was enough to cause obe- 
dience to him. . . 
The characteristic of his genins, so well de- 
fined, so ill understood, was less audacity than 
justness. Beneath the grandeur of his expression 
was always to be found unfailing good sense. 
His very vices could not repress the clearness, 
the sincerity of his understanding. At the foot 
of the tribune, he was a man devoid of shame 
or virtue: in the tribune, he was an honest man. 
Abandoned to private debauchery, bought over 
by foreign powers, sold to the court in order to 
satisfy his: lavish expenditures, he preserved, 
amidst, all this infamous traffic of his powers, 
the. incorruptibility., of his genius. Of all the 
qualities of being ‘the great man of an age, 
Mirabeau was wanting only in honesty. The 
people were not his devotees, but his instruments. 
His faith was in posterity, His conscience existed 
only in his thought. The fanaticism of his ideas 
was quite human. The chilling materialism of 
his age had ecrusht in his heart all expansive 
foree, and craving for imperishable things. His 
dying words were: ‘‘Sprinkle me with perfumes, 
crown me with flowers, that I may thus enter 
upon eternali sleep.’? He was especially of his 
time, and his course bears no impress of infinity. 
Neither his character, his acts, nor his thoughts 
have the brand of immortality. If he had be- 
lieved in God, he might have died a martyr.

  teries, flanked with towers, formed the girdle 
of this great city, in the center, raised on an 
eminence, was a strong citadel, a kind of capitol, 
whence were seen at the same time the temples 
of the Deity and the palaces of the emperors, 
where above embattled walls rose majestic domes, 
bearing the emblem that represents thé whole 
history of Russia and her ambition, the cross 
over the reversed crescent. This citadel was the 
Kremlin, the ancient abode of the Czars. 
The imagination, and the idea of glory, being 
both excited by this magical spectacle, the sol- 
diers raised one shout of ‘‘Moscow! Moscow!’’ 
Those who had remained at the foot of the hill 
hastened to reach the top; for a moment all ranks 
mingled, and everybody wished to contemplate 
the great capital, toward which we had made 
such an adventurous march. One could not have 
enough of this dazzling spectacle, caleulated to 
awaken so many different feelings. Napoleon 
arrived in his turn, and, struck with what he 
saw, he—who, like the oldest soldiers in the army, 
had successively visited Cairo, Memphis, the Jor- 
dan, Milan, Vienna, Berlin, and Madrid—could 
not help experiencing deep emotion. 
Arrived at this summit of his glory, from which 
he was to descend with such a rapid step toward 
the abyss, he experienced a sort of intoxication, 
forgot all the reproaches that his good sense, 
the only conscience of conquerors, had addrest 
to him for two months, and for a moment be- 
lieved still that his enterprise was a great and 
marvelous one—that to have dared to march 
from Paris to Smolensk, from Smolensk to Mos- 
cow, was a great and happy rashness, justified

  by the event. Certain of his glory, he still be- 
lieved in his good fortune, and his lieutenants, 
as amazed as he, remembering no more their fre- 
quent discontents during this campaign, gave vent 
to those victorious demonstrations in which they 
had not indulged at the termination of the bloody 
day of Borodino. This moment of satisfaction, 
lively and short, was one of the most deeply 
felt in his life. Alas! it was to be the last! 
Murat received the injunction fo march quickly, 
to avoid all disorder. General Durosnel was sent 
forward to hold communication with the authori- 
ties, and lead them to the conqueror’s feet, who 
desired to receive their homage and ealm their 
fears. M. Denniée was charged to go and pre- 
pare food and lodging for the army. Murat, 
galloping at the head of the light cavalry, ar- 
rived, at length, across the faubourg of Drogo- 
milow, at the bridge of the Moskowa. There he 
found a Russian rear-guard, who were retreating, 
and inquired if there was no officer there who 
knew French. A young Russian, who spoke our 
language correctly, presented himself immediate- 
ly before this king, whom hostile nations knew 
so well, and asked what he wanted. Murat hav- 
ing exprest a wish to know which was the com- 
mander of this rear-guard, the young Russian 
pointed out an officer with white hair, clothed 
in a bivouae cloak of long fur. Murat, with his 
aceustomed grace, held out his hand to the old 
officer, who took it eagerly. Thus national hatred 
was silenced before valor. 
Murat asked the commander of the enemy’s 
rear-guard if they knew him. ‘‘Yes,’’ replied 
the latter, ‘‘we have seen enough of you under 
203
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD’S CLASSICS 
  fire to know you.’’ Murat seeming struck with 
the long fur mantle, which looked as if it would 
be very comfortable for a bivouae, the old officer 
unfastened it from his shoulders to make him a 
present of it. Murat, receiving it with as much 
courtesy as it was offered, took a beautiful watch 
and presented it to the enemy’s officer, who re- 
eeived this present in the same way as his had 
been accepted. After these acts of courtesy, the 
Russian rear-guard filed off rapidly.to give ground 
to our vanguard. The King of Naples, followed 
by his staff and a detachment of cavalry, went 
down into the streets of Moscow, traversed alter- 
nately the poorest and the richest quarters, rows 
of woodén houses crowded together, and a suc- 
cession of splendid palaces rising from amidst 
vast gardens: he found everywhere the most 
profound silence. It seemed as if they were pen- 
etrating into a dead city, whose inhabitants had 
suddenly disappeared. 
The first sight of it, surprizing as it was, did 
not remind us of our entry into Berlin or Vienna. 
Nevertheless, the first feeling of terror experi- 
eneed by the inhabitants might explain this soli- 
tude. Suddenly some distracted individuals ap- 
peared; they were some French people, belonging 
to the foreign families settled at Moscow, and 
asked us in the name of heaven to save them from 
the robbers who had become masters of the town. 
‘They were well received, but we tried in vain 
to remove their fears. We were conducted to 
the Kremlin, and had hardly arrived in sight

of these old walls than we were exposed to a 
discharge of shot. It came from bandits let 
loose on Moseow by the ferocious patriotism of 
the Count of Rostopchin. These wretched beings 
had invaded the saered citadel, had seized the 
guns in the arsenal, and were firing on the French 
who came to disturb them after their few hours’ 
reign of anarchy. Several were sabered, and the 
Kremlin was relieved of their presence. But on 
making inquiry we learned that the whole pop- 
ulation had fled, except a small number of 
strangers, or of Russians acquainted with the 
ways of the French and not fearing their pres- 
ence. This news vexed the leaders of our van- 
guard, who were flattering themselves that they 
would see a whole population coming before them, 
whom they would take pleasure in comforting 
and filling with surprize and gratitude. They 
made haste to restore some order to the different 
quarters of the town, and to pursue the thieves, 
who thought they should mueh longer enjoy the 
prey that the Count of Rostopchin had given 
up to them. 
The next morning, September 15, Napoleon 
made his entry into Moscow, at the head of his 
invincible legions, but he crossed a deserted town, 
and for the first time his soldiers, on entering 
a capital, found none but themselves to be wit-

  experienced was sad. Napoleon, arrived at the 
Kremlin, hastened to mount the high tower of 
the great Ivan, and to contemplate from that 
height his magnificent conquest, across which the 
Moskowa was slowly pursuing its winding course. 
Thousands of blackbirds, ravens and crows, as 
numerous here as the pigeons at Venice, flying 
around the tops of the palaces and churches, gave 
a singular aspect to this great city, which cun- 
trasted strangely with the brightness of its bril- 
liant colors. A mournful silence, disturbed only 
by the tramp of cavalry, had taken the place of 
life in this city, which till the evening before 
had been one of the most busy in the world. In 
spite of the sadness of this solitude, Napoleon, 
on finding Moscow abandoned like the other Rus- 
sian towns, thought himself happy nevertheless 
in not finding it burned up, and did not despair 
of softening little by little the hatred which the 
presence of his flags had inspired sinee Vitebsk. 
The army hoped, then, to enjoy Moscow, to 
find peace there, and, in any case, good winter 
eantonments if the war was prolonged. How- 
ever, on the morrow after the day on which the 
entry had been made, columns of flame arose 
from a very large building which contained the 
spirits that the government sold on its own 
account to the people of the capital. People ran 
there, without astonishment or terror, for they 
attributed the cause of this partial fire to the 
nature of the materials contained in this building, 
or to some imprudence committed by our soldiers. 
In fact, the fire was mastered, and we had time 
to reassure ourselves. 
But all at once the fire burst out at almost 
206

  the same instant with extreme violence in a 
collection of buildings that was called the Bazaar. 
This bazaar, situated to the northeast of the 
Kremlin comprized the richest shops, those in 
whieh were sold the beautiful stuffs of India and 
Persia, the rarities of Europe, the colonial com- 
modities, sugar, coffee, tea, and, lastly, precious 
wines. In a few minutes the fire had spread 
through the bazaar, and the soldiers of the guard 
ran in crowds. and made the greatest efforts to 
arrest its progress. Unhappily, they could not 
succeed, and soon the immense riches of this 
establishment fell a prey to the flames. Eager 
to dispute with the fire the possession of these 
riches, belonging to no one at this time, and to 
secure them for themselves, our soldiers, not 
having been able to save them, tried to drag out 
some fragments. 
They might be seen coming out of the bazaar, 
carrying furs, silks, wines of great value, with- 
out any one dreaming of reproaching them for 
so doing, for they wronged no one but the fire, 
the sole master of these treasures. One might 
regret it on the score of discipline, but could 
not east a reproach on their honor on that ac- 
count. Besides, those who remained of the peo- 
ple set them an example, and took their large 
share of these spoils of the commerce of Moseow. 
Yet it was only one large building—an extremely 
rich one, it is true—that was attacked by the 
fire, and there was no fear for the town itself. 
These first disasters, of little consequence so far, 
were attributed to a very natural and very or- 
dinary aceident, which might be more easily ex- 
plained still, in the bustle of evacuating the town. 
207
-P-A-G-E-219

    During the night of the 15th of September the 
scene suddenly changed. As if every misfortune 
was to fall at once on the old Muscovite capital, 
the equinoctial wind arose all at once with the 
. double violence natural to the season and to level 
countries where nothing stops the storm. This 
wind, blowing at first from the east, carried the 
fire westward, along the streets situated between 
the roads from Tver and Smolensk, and which 
are known as the richest and most beautiful in 
Moseow, those of Tverskaia, Nikitskaia, and Po- 
vorskaia. In a few hours the fire, having spread 
fiereely among the wooden buildings, commu- 
nicated itself from one to another with frightful 
rapidity. Shooting forth in long tongues of 
flame, it was seen invading other quarters situ- 
ated to the west. 5 
Roekets were noticed in the air, and soon 
wretches were seized carrying combustibles at 
the end of long poles. They were taken up; they 
were questioned with threats of death, and they 
revealed the frightful secret, the order given by 
the Count of Rostopchin to set fire to the city of 
Moscow, as if it had been the smallest village 
on the road from Smolensk. This news spread 
ecnsternation through the army in an instant. 
To doubt was no longer possible, after the arrests 
made, and the depositions collected from different 
parts of the town. Napoleon ordered that in 
each quarter the corps fixt there should form 
military commissions to try, shoot, and hang on 
gibbets the incendiaries taken in the act. He 
ordered likewise that they should employ all the 
troops there were in the town to extinguish the 
fire. They ran to the pumps, but there were none 
208

  to be found. This last circumstance would have 
left no doubt, if there had remained any, of the 
frightful design that delivered Moscow to the 
flames. 
Napoleon, followed by some of his lieutenants, 
went out of that Kremlin which the Russian 
army had not been able to prevent him from 
entering, but from which the fire expelled him 
after four-and-twenty hours of possession, de- 
scended to the quay of Moskowa, found his horses 
ready there, and had much difficulty in crossing 
the town, which toward the northwest, whither 
he directed his course, was already in flames. 
The wind, which constantly increased in violence, 
sometimes caused columns of fire to bend to the 
ground, and drove before it torrents of sparks, 
smoke, and stifling cinders. The horrible ap- 
pearance of the sky answered to the no less 
Aorrible spectacle of the earth. The terrified 
army went out of Moscow. The divisions of 
Prince Eugene and Marshal Ney, which had en- 
tered the evening before, turned back again on 
the roads of Zwenigorod and Saint Petersburg; 
those of Marshal Davoust returned by the road 
of Smolensk, and, except the guard left around 
the Kremlin to dispute its possession with the 
flames, our troops retired in haste, struck with 
horror, before this fire, which, after darting up 
toward the sky, seemed to bend down again over 
them as if it wished to devour them. A small 
number of the inhabitants who had remained 
in Moscow, and had hidden at first in their houses 
without daring to come out, now escaped from 
them, carrying away what was most dear to them 
—women their children, men their infirm parents.

the bed of death by the dim light of the single

father’s passive features, from which the life 
has almost ebbed. Bianchon with thoughtful tact 
left the room.

  me but you in all the world. My own children 
will hate me. Take me with you, father; I will 
love you, I will take eare of you. He does not 
hear me—I am mad—’’ 
She fell on her knees, and gazed wildly at the 
human wreck before her. 
‘“My eup of misery is full,’’ she said, turning 
her eyes upon Eugene. ‘‘M. de Trailles has fled, 
leaving enormous debts behind him, and I have 
found out that he was deceiving me. My hus- 
band will never forgive me, and I have left my 
fortune in his hands. I have lost all my illu-

spoke), and for whom? TI have held his kind- 
ness cheap, and slighted his affection; many and 
many a time I have given him pain, ungrateful 
wretch that I am!’’ 
‘“He knew it,’’ said Rastignae. 
Just then Goriot’s eyelids unclosed; it was 
only a muscular contraction, but the Countess’s 
sudden start of reviving hope was no less dread- 
ful than the dying eyes. 
“Tg it possible that he can hear me?’’ cried 
the Countess. ‘‘No,’’ she answered herself, and 
sat down beside the bed. As Mme. De Restaud 
seemed to wish to sit by her father, Eugene 
went down to take a little food. The boarders 
were already assembled. 
‘¢Well,’’? remarked the painter, as he joined 
them, ‘‘it seems that there is to be a death- 
drama up-stairs.’’ 
‘‘Charles, I think you might find something 
less painful to joke about,’’ said Eugene. 
‘“‘So we may not laugh here?’’ returned the

said that the old man was quite insensible.’’ 
' «Well, then,’’ said the employé from the Mu- 
seum, ‘‘he will die as he has lived.’’ 
‘*My father is dead!’’ shrieked the Countess. 
The terrible cry brought Sylvie, Rastignae, and 
Bianchon; Mme. de Restaud had fainted away, 
When she recovered they carried her down-stairs, 
and put her into the cab that stood waiting at 
the door. Eugene sent Therese with her, and 
bade the maid take the Countess to Mme. de 
Nucingen. 
Bianchon came down to them. 
“*Yes, he is dead,’’ he said. 
- Come, sit down to dinner, gentlemen,’’ said 
Mme. Vauquer, ‘‘or the soup will be cold.’’ 
The two students sat down together. 
‘What is the next thing to be done?’’ Eugene 
asked of Bianchon. 
“I have closed his eyes and composed his 
limbs,’’ said Bianchon. ‘‘When the certificate 
has been officially registered at the Mayor’s of- 
fice, we will sew him in his winding-sheet and 
bury him somewhere. What do you think we 
ought to do?’ 
“He will not smell at his bread like this any 
more,’’ said the painter, mimicking the old man’s 
litile trick. 
“Oh, hang it all!’’ cried the tutor, ‘‘let old 
Goriot drop, and let us have something else 
for a change. He is a standing dish, and we 
have had him with every sauce this hour or 
more. It is one of the privileges of the good 
city of Paris that anybody may be born, or live, 
or die there without attracting any attention

  whatsoever. Let us profit’ by the advantages of 
civilization. There are fifty or sixty deaths every 
day; if you have a mind to do it, you can sit 
down at any time and wail over whole hecatombs 
of dead in Paris. Old Goriot has gone off the 
hooks, has he? So mnch the better for him. If 
you venerate his memory, keep it to yourselves, 
and let the rest of us feed in peace.’’ 
*‘Oh, to be sure,’’ said the widow, ‘‘it is all 
the better for him that he is dead. It looks as 
tho he had had trouble enough, poor soul, while 
he was alive.’’ 
And this was all the funeral oration delivered 
over him who had been for Eugene the type 
and embodiment of fatherhood. 
When the hearse came, Eugene had the coffin 
earried into the house again, unscrewed the lid, 
and reverently laid on the old man’s breast the 
token that recalled the days when Delphine and 
Anastasie were innocent little maidens, before 
they began ‘‘to think for themselves,’’ as he had 
mganed out in his agony. 
Rastignae and Christophe and the two under- 
taker’s men were the only followers of the fu- 
neral. The Church of Saint-Etienne du Mont 
was only a little distance from the Rue Neuve- 
Sainte-Genevieve. When the coffin had been de- 
posited in a lew, dark, little chapel, the law 
student looked around in vain for Goriot’s two 
daughters or their husbands. Christophe was 
his only fellow mourner: Christophe, who ap- 
peared to think it was his duty to attend the 
funeral of the man who had put him in the 
way of such handsome tips. As they waited 
there in the chapel for the two priests, the

chorister, and the beadle, Rastignae grasped 
Christophe’s hand. He could not utter a word 
just then. 
«Yes, Monsieur Eugene,’’ said Christophe, ‘‘he 
was a good and worthy man who never said 
one word louder than another; he never did any 
one any harm, and gave nobody any trouble.’’ 
The two priests, the chorister, and the beadle 
came, and said and did as much as could be 
expected for seventy franes in an age wher 
religion can not afford to say prayers for nothing. 
The ecclesiastics chanted a psalm, the Libera 
nos and the De profundis. The whole service 
lasted about twenty minutes. There was but one 
mourning coach, which the priest and chorister 
agreed to share with Eugene and Christophe. 
‘*There is no one else to follow us,’’ remarked 
the priest, ‘‘so we may as well go quickly, and 
so save time; it is half-past five.’’ 
But just as the coffin was put in the hearse, 
two empty carriages, with the armorial bearings 
of the Comte de Restaud and the Baron de Nu- 
cingen, arrived and followed in the procession 
to Pere-Lachaise. At six o’clock Goriot’s coffin 
was lowered into the grave, his daughters’ serv- 
ants standing round the while. The ecclesiastic 
recited the short prayer that the students could 
afford to pay for, and then both priest and 
lackeys disappeared at once. The two grave- 
diggers flung in several spadefuls of earth, and 
then stopt and asked Rastignac for their fee. 
Eugene felt in vain in his pocket, and was ob- 
liged to borrow five franes of Christophe.

BIROTTEAU’S EARLY MARRIED LIFE? 
‘*You will have a good husband, my little 
girl,’’ said M. Pillerault. ‘‘He has a warm heart 
and sentiments of honor. He is as straight as 
a line, and as good as the child Jesus; he is a 
king of men, in short.’’ 
Constance put away once and for all the 
dreams of a brilliant future, which, like most 
shop-girls, she had sometimes indulged. She 
meant to be a faithful wife and a good mother, 
and took up this life in accordance with the 
religious program of the middle classes. After 
all, her new ideas were much better than the 
dangerous vanities tempting to a youthful Pari- 
sian imagination. Constance’s intelligence was 
a narrow one; she was the typical smail trades- 
man’s wife, who always grumbles a little over 
her work, who refuses a thing at the outset, 
and is vexed when she is taken at her word; 
whose restless activity takes all things, from eash- 
box to kitchen, as its province, and supervises 
everything, from the weightiest business trans- 
action down to almost invisible darns in tho 
household linen. Such a woman scolds while 
she loves, and can only conceive ideas of the 
very simplest; only the small change, as it were, 
of thonght passes current with her; she argues 
about everything, lives in chronic fear of the

  anknown, makes constant forecasts, and is al- 
ways thinking of the future. Her statuesque yet 
girlish beauty, her engaging looks, her freshness, 
prevented César from thinking of her short- 
comings; and moreover, she made up for them 
by a woman’s sensitive conseientiousness, an 
excessive thrift, by her fanatical love of work, 
and genius as a saleswoman. 
Constance was just eighteen years old, and the 
possessor of eleven thousand francs. César, in 
whom love had developed the most unbounded 
ambition, bought the perfumery business, and 
transplanted the Queen of Roses to a handsome 
shop near the Place Véndome. He was only 
twenty-one years of age, married to a beautiful 
and adored wife, and almost the owner of his 
establishment, for he had paid three-fourths of 
the amount. He saw (how should he have seen 
otherwise?) the future in fair colors, which 
seemed fairer still as he measured his career 
from its starting-point. 
Roguin (Ragon’s notary) drew up the mar- 
riage-contract, and gave sage counsels to the 
young perfumer; he it was who interfered when 
the latter was about to complete the purchase 
of the business with the wife’s money. ‘‘Just 
keep the money by you, my boy; ready money 
is sometimes a handy thing in a business,’’ he 
had said. . . 
During the first year César instructed his wife 
in all the ins and outs of the perfumery business, 
which she was admirably quick to grasp; she 
might have been brought into the world for that 
sole purpose, so well did she adapt herself to 
her customers. The result of the stock-taking 
216

  at the end of the year alarmed the ambitious 
perfumer. .After deducting all expenses, he 
might perhaps hope, in twenty years’ time, to 
make the modest sum of a hundred thousand 
franes, the price of his felicity. He determined 
then and there to find some speedier road to 
fortune, and by way of a beginning, to be a 
manufacturer as well as a retailer. 
Acting against his wife’s counsel, he took the 
lease of a shed on some building land in the 
Faubourg du Temple, and painted up thereon, 
in huge letters, Cesar Brrorreau’s Factory. 
He enticed a workman from Grasse, and with 
him began to manufacture several kinds of soap, 
essences, and eau-de-cologne, on the system of 
half profits. The partnership only lasted six 
months, and ended in a loss, whieh he had to 
sustain alone; but Birottean did not lose heart. 
He meant to obtain a result at any price, if it 
were only to escape a scolding from his wife; 
and, indeed, he confest to her afterward that, , 
in those days of despair, his head used to boil 
like a pot on the fire, and that many a time 
but for his religious principles he would have 
thrown himself into the Seine. 
One day, deprest by several unsuccessful ex- 
periments, he was sauntering home to dinner 
along the boulevards (the lounger in Paris is a 
man in despair quite as often as a genuine 
idler), when a book among a hamperful at six 
sous apiece caught his attention; his eyes were 
attracted by the yellow dusty title-page, Abdeker, 
so it ran, or the Art of Preserving Beauty. 
Birotteau took up the work. It claimed to be 
a translation from the Arabic, but in reality it 
217
-P-A-G-E-229

was a sort of romance written by a physician 
in the previous century. César happened to 
stumble upon a passage there which treated of 
. perfumes, and with his back against a tree in 
the boulevard, he turned the pages over till he 
reached a foot-note, wherein the learned author 
discoursed of the nature of the dermis and epi- 
dermis. The writer showed conclusively that 
such and such an unguent or soap often produced 
an effect exactly opposite to that intended, and 
the ointment, or the soap, acted as a tonie upon 
a skin that required a lenitive treatment, or 
vice versa. 
Birotteau saw a fortune in the book, and 
bought it. Yet, feeling little confidence in his 
unaided lights, he went to Vauquelin, the cele- 
brated chemist, and in all simplicity asked him 
how to compose a double cosmetic which should 
produce the required effect upon the human epi- 
dermis in either case. The really learned—men 
so truly great in this sense that they can never 
receive in their lifetime all the fame that should 
reward vast labors like theirs—are almost always 
helpful and kindly to the poor in intellect. So 
it was with Vauquelin. He came to the assistance 
of the perfumer, gave him a formula for a paste 
to whiten the hands, and allowed him to style 
himself its inventor. It was this cosmetic that 
Birotteau called the Superfine Pate des Sultanes. 
The more thoroughly to accomplish his purpose, 
he used the recipe for the paste fyr a wash for 
the complexion, which he called the Carminative 
Toilet Lotion. : 
César Birotteau might be a Royalist, but public 
opinion at that time was in his favor; and tho 
218

  he had scarcely a hundred thousand frances beside 
his business, was looked upon as a very wealthy 
man. His steady-going ways, his punctuality, his 
habit of paying ready money for everything, of 
never discounting bills, while he would take 
paper to oblige a customer of whom he was 
sure—all these things, together with his readiness 
to oblige, had brought him a great reputation. 
And not only so; he had really made a good 
deal-of money, but the building of his factories 
had absorbed most of it, and he paid nearly 
twenty thousand franes a year in rent. The 
edueation of their only daughter, whom Constance 
and César both idolized, had been a heavy ex- 
pense. Neither the husband nor the wife thought 
of money where Cesarine’s pleasure was con- 
cerned, and they had never brought themselves 
to part with her. 
Imagine the delight of the poor peasant par- 
venu when he heard his charming Cesarine play 
a sonata by Steibelt or sing a ballad; when he 
saw her writing French correctly, or making sepia 
drawings of landscapes, or listened while she read 
aloud from the Racines, father and son, and 
explained the beauties of the poetry. What hap- 
piness it was for him to live again in this fair, 
innocent flower, not yet plucked from the parent 
stem; this angel, over whose growing graces and 
earliest development they had watched with such 
passionate tenderness; this only child, incapable 
of despising her father or of laughing at his 
want of education, so much was she his little 
daughter. * 
When Césa.‘ came to Paris, he had known how 
to read, write, and cipher, and at that point his

  education had been arrested. There had been 
no opportunity in his hard-working life of ac- 
quiring new ideas and information beyond the 
perfumery trade. He had spent his time among 
folk to whom science and literature were matters 
of indifference, and whose knowledge was of a 
limited and special kind; he himself, having 
no time to spare for loftier studies, became per- 
force a practical man. He adopted (how should 
he have done otherwise?) the language, errors, 
and opinions of the Parisian tradesman who ad- 
mires Moliére, Voltaire, and Rousseau on hear- 
say, and buys their works, but never opens them; 
who will have it that the proper way to pro- 
nounce “armoire”? is ‘‘ormoire’’; ‘‘or’? means 
gold, and ‘‘moire’’ means silk, and women’s 
dresses used almost always to be made of silk, 
and in their eupboards they locked up silk and 
gold—therefore, ‘‘ormoire’’ is right and ‘‘ar- 
moire’? is an innovation. Potier, Talma, Mlle. 
Mars, and other actors and actresses were mil- 
lionaires ten times over, and did not live like 
ordinary mortals: the great tragedian lived on 
raw meat, and Mile. Mars would have a fricassee 
of pearls now and then*-an idea she had taken 
from some celebrated Egyptian actress. As to 
the Emperor, his waistcoat pockets were lined 
with leather, so that he could take a handful 
of snuff at a time; he used to ride at full gallop 
up the stairease of the orangery at Versailles. 
Authors and artists ended in the workhouse, 
the natural close to their eccentric careers; they 
were, every one of them, atheists into the bar- 
gain, so that you had to be very careful not 
to admit anybody of that sort into your house.

César’s wife, who had learned to know her 
husband’s character during the early years of 
their marriage, led a life of perpetual terror; 
she represented sound sense and foresight in the 
partnership; she was doubt, opposition, and fear, 
while César represented boldness, ambition, ac- 
tivity, the element of chance and undreamed-of 
good luck. In spite of appearances, the merchant 
was the weaker vessel, and it was the wife who 
really had the patience and courage. So it had 
come to pass that a timid mediocrity, without 
education, knowledge, or strength of character, a 
being who could in nowise have succeeded in the 
world’s most slippery places, was taken for a 
remarkable man, a man of spirit and resolution, 
thanks to his instinctive uprightness and sense 
of justice, to the goodness of a truly Christian 
soul, and love for the one woman who had been 
his.

RICHELIEU’S WAY WITH HIS MASTER* 
Tur latter [Cardinal de Richelieu], attired in 
all the pomp of a cardinal, leaning upon two 
young pages, and followed by his captain of 
the guards and more than five hundred gentle- 
men attached to his house, advanced toward 
the King slowly and stopping at each step, as 
if forcibly arrested by his suffermgs, but in’ 
reality to observe the faces before him. A glance 
sufficed. 
His suite remained at the entrance of the royal 
tent; of all those within it not one was bold 
enough to salute him, or to look toward him. 
Even La Vallette feigned to be deeply oceupied 
in a conversation with Montresor; and the King,

Mars was a favorite of Louis XIII, grand-master of the 
wardrobe and the horse, and aspired to a seat in the royal 
council and to the hand of Maria de Gonzaga, Princess of 
Mantua. Having been refused by Richelieu a place-in the 
council, he formed a conspiracy against the cardinal and en- 
tered into a treasonable correspondence with Spain. The 
conspiracy being discovered, he was beheaded at Lyons in 
1642. Bulwer'’s popular play “Richelieu,” tho founded on 
this episode, diverges radically im several details.

  who desired to give him an unfavorable recep- 
tion, greeted him lightly and continued a con- 
versation aside in a low voice with the Duc de 
Beaufort. 
The cardinal was therefore forced, after the 
first salute, to stop and pass to the side of the 
erowd of courtiers, as tho he wished to mix with 
them, but in reality to test them more closely; 
they all recoiled as at the sight of a leper. 
Fabert alone advanced toward him with the frank 
and blunt air habitual with him, and making 
use of the terms belonging to his profession, 
said: 
‘¢Well, my Lord, you make a breach in the 
midst of them like a eannon-ball; I ask pardon 
in their name.’’ 
‘«And you stand firm before me as before the 
enemy,’’ said the cardinal; ‘‘you will have no 
eause to regret it in the end, my dear Fabert.’’ 
Mazarin also approached the cardinal, but with 
caution, and giving to his flexible features an 
expression of profound sadness, made him five 
or six very low bows, turning his back to the 
group gathered round the King, so that in the 
latter quarter they might be taken for those 
eold and hasty salutations which are made to 
a person one desires to be rid of, and, on the 
part of the Due, for tokens of respect blended 
with a discreet and silent sorrow. 
The minister, ever calm, smiled in disdain; and 
assuming that firm look and that air of grandeur 
which he wore so perfectly in the hour of danger, 
he again leaned upon his pages, and without 
waiting for a word or glance from his sovereign, 
he suddenly resolved upon his line of eonduet, 
223
-P-A-G-E-235

  and walked directly toward him, traversing the 
whole length of the tent. No one had lost sight 
of him, altho affecting not to observe him.. Every 
one now became silent, even those. who were 
talking to the King; all the courtiers bent for- 
ward to see and to hear. 
Louis XIII turned round in astonishment, and 
all presence of mind totally failing him, re- 
mained motionless, and waited with an icy glance 
—his sole force, but a vis inertie very effectual 
in a prince. 
The cardinal, on coming close to the prince, 
did not bow; and without changing his position, 
his eyes lowered and his hands placed on the 
shoulders of the two boys half-bending, he said: 
‘Sire, I come to implore your Majesty at 
length to grant me the retirement for which I 
have long sighed. My health is failing; I feel 
that my life will soon be ended. Eternity ap- 
proaches me, and before rendering an account 
to the eternal King, I would render one to my 
tempora! sovereign. It is eighteen years, Sire, 
since you placed in my hands a weak and divided 
kingdom; I return it to you united and power- 
ful. Your enemies are overthrown and humili- 
ated. My work is accomplished. I ask your 
Majesty’s permission to retire to Citeaux, of 
which I am abbot, and where I may end my 
days in prayer and meditation.’’ 
The King, irritated with some haughty expres- 
sions in this address, showed none of the signs 
of weakness which the cardinal had expected, 
and which he had always seen in him when he 
had threatened to resign the management of 
affairs. On the contrary, feeling that he had

  the eyes of the whole court upon ‘him, Louis 
jooked upon him with the air of a king, and 
coldly replied: : 
‘We thank you, then, for your services, M. 
le Cardinal, and wish you the repose you desire.’’ 
Richelieu was deeply angered, but no indica- 
tion of his rage appeared upon his countenance, 
*‘Such was the coldness with which you left 
Montmorency to die,’’ he said to himself; ‘‘but 
you shall not escape me thus.’’ He then con~ 
tinued aloud, bowing at the same time: 
“‘The only recompense I ask for my services 
is that your Majesty will deign to accept from 
me, as a gift, the Palais-Cardinal I have already 
erected at my own cost in Paris.’’ 
The King, astonished, bowed in token of as- 
sent. A murmur of surprize for a moment agi- 
tated the attentive court. 
“ET also petition your Majesty to grant me 
the revoeation of an act of rigor, which I solic- 
ited (I publicly confess it), and which I perhaps 
regarded as too beneficial to the repose of the 
state. Yes, when I was of this world, I was too 
forgetful of my old sentiments of personal re- 
spect and attachment, in my eagerness for the 
public welfare; now that I already enjoy the 
enlightenment of solitude, I see that I have been 
wrong, and I repent.’’ 
The attention of the speetators was redoubled, 
and: the uneasiness of the King became visible. 
‘Yes, there is one person, Sire, whom I have 
always loved, despite her wrongs toward you, 
and the banishment which the affairs of the 
kingdom forced me to procure for her; a person 
to whom I have owed much, and who should be

  very dear to you, notwithstanding her armed 
attempts against you; a person, in a word, whom 
I implore you to recall from exile—the Queen 
Marie de Medicis, your mother.’’ 
The King sent forth an involuntary exelama- 
tion, so far was he from expecting to hear that 
name. A represt agitation suddenly appeared 
upon every face. All awaited in. silence the 
King’s reply. Louis XIII looked for a long time 
at his old minister without speaking, and this 
look decided the fate of France; in that instant 
_ he called to mind all the indefatigable services 
of Richelieu, his unbounded devotion, his won- 
derful capacity, and was surprized at himself 
for having wished to part with him. He felt 
deeply affected at this request, which hunted 
out, as it were, the exact cause of his anger at 
the bottom of his heart, rooted it up, and took 
from his hands the only weapon he had against 
his old servant; filial love brought the words of 
pardon to his lips and tears into his eyes. De- 
lighted to grant what he desired most of all 
things in the world, he extended his hand to 
the Due with all the nobleness and kindliness of 
a Bourbon. The cardinal bowed, and respect- 
fully kissed it; and his heart, which should have 
burst with remorse, only swelled in the joy of 
a haughty triumph. 
The prince, much moved, abandoning his hand 
to him, turned gracefully toward his court and 
said with a tremulous voice: 
“We often deceive ourselves, gentlemen, and 
especially in our knowledge of so great a politi- 
cian as this; I hope he will never leave us, since 
his heart is as good ag his head.’’

the arm of the King’s mantle, and kissed it 
with all the ardor of a lover, and the young

self, assuming with admirable Italian suppleness 
an expression radiant with joyful emotion. Two 
streams of flatterers hastened, one toward the 
King, the other toward the minister; the f 
group, not less adroit than the second, altho Tess 
direct, addrest to the prince thanks which could 
be heard by the minister, and burned at the feet. 
of the one incense which was destined for the

Tz battle of Waterloo is an enigma as obscure 
for those who gained it as for him who lost it. 
To Napoleon it is a panic; Blucher sees nothing 
in it but fire; Wellington does not understand 
it at all. Look at the reports: the bulletins are 
confused; the commentaries are entangled; the 
latter stammer, the former stutter. Jomini divides

  dignity, enlightenment, and genius are not num- 
bers which those gamblers, heroes, and conquerors 
can stake in the lottery of battles. Very often 
a battle lost is progress gained, and less of glory, 
more of liberty. The drummer is silent and 
reason speaks; it is the game of who loses wins. 
Let us, then, speak of Waterloo coldly from both 
sides, and render to chance the things that belong 
to chance, and to God what is God’s. What is 
Waterloo—a victory? No; a quine in the lottery, 
won by Europe, and paid by France; it was 
hardly worth while erecting a lion for it. 
Waterloo, by the way, is the strangest en- 
counter recorded in history; Napoleon and Well- 
ington are not enemies, but contraries. Never 
did God, who delights in antitheses, produce a 
more striking contrast, or a more extraordinary 
confrontation. Qn one side precision, foresight, 
geometry, prudence, a retreat assured, reserves 
prepared, an obstinate coolness, an imperturbable 
method, strategy profiting by the ground, tactics 
balancing battalions, carnage measured by a 
plumb-line, war regulated watch in hand, nothing 
left voluntarily to: accident, old classic courage 
and absolute correctness. On the other side we 
have intuition, divination, military strangeness, 
superhuman instinct, a flashing glance ;.somethin, 
that gazes like the eagle and strikes like light- 
ning, all the mysteries of a profound mind, asso- 
ciation with destiny; the river, the. plain, the 
forest, and the hill summoned, and, to some 
extent, compelled to obey, the despot going so 
far as even to tyrannize over the battle-field; 
faith in a star, blended with strategic science, 
heightening, but troubling it. Wellington was

  VICTOR HUGO 
  the Baréme of war, Napoleon was its Michel- 
angelo, and this true genius was conquered by 
ealeulation,. On both sides somebody was ex- 
pected; and it was the exact caleulator who 
succeeded. Napoleon waited for Grouchy, who 
did not come; Wellington waited for Bluecher, and 
he came. 
Wellington is the classical war-taking its re- 
venge; Bonaparte, in his dawn, had met it in 
Italy, and superbly defeated it—the old owl fled 
before the young vulture. The old tactics had 
been not only overthrown, but scandalized. Who 
was this Corsican of. six-and-twenty years of 
age? What meant this splendid ignoramus, who, 
having everything against him, nothing for him, 
without provisions, ammunition, guns, shoes, al- 
most without an army, with a handful of men 
against masses, dashed at allied Europe, and 
absurdly gained impossible victories? Who was 
this new comet of war who possest the effrontery 
of a planet? The academic military school ex- 
communicated him, while bolting, and hence arose 
an implacable rancor of the old Cesarism against 
the new, of the old saber against the flashing 
sword, and of the chessboard against genius. On 
June 18th, 1815, this rancor got the best; and 
beneath Lodi, Montebello, Montenotte, Mantua, 
Marengo, and Arcola, it wrote—Waterloo. It 
was a triumph of mediocrity, sweet to majorities, 
and destiny consented to this irony. In his de- 
celine, Napoleon found a young Suvarov before 
him—in fact, it is only necessary to blanch Well- 
ington’s hair in order to have a Suvarov. Water- 
loo is a battle of the first class, gained by & 
captain of the second.

THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
    What must be admired in the battle of Water- 
loo is England, the English firmness, the English 
resolution, the English blood, and what England 
had really superb in it, is (without offense) her- 
self; it is not her captain, but her army. Well- 
ington, strangely ungrateful, declares in his dis- 
patch to Lord Bathurst that his army, the one 
which fought on June 18th, 1815, was a ‘‘de- 
testable army.’’ What does the gloomy pile of 
bones buried in the trenches of Waterloo think 
of this? England has been too modest to herself 
in her treatment of Wellington, for making him 
so great is making herself small. Wellington is 
merely a hero, like any other man. The Scotch 
Grays, the Life Guards, Maitland and Mitchell’s 
regiments, Pack and Kempt’s infantry, Ponsonby 
and Somerset’s cavalry, the Highlanders playing 
the bagpipes under the shower of canister, Ry- 
Jand’s battalions, the fresh recruits who could 
hardly manage a musket, and yet held their 
ground against the old bands of Essling and 
Rivoli—all this is grand. Wellington was tena- 
cious; that was his merit, and we do not deny 
it to him, but the lowest of his privates and 
his troopers was quite as solid as he, and the 
iron soldier is as good as the iron duke. For 
our part, all our glorification is offered to the 
English soldier, the English army, the English 
nation; and if there must be a trophy, it is to 
England that this trophy is owing. The Waterloo 
column would be more just, if, instead of the 
figure of a man, it raised to the clouds the statue 
of a people. 
But this great England will be irritated by 
what we are writing here; for she still has feudal

illusions, after her 1688 and the French 1789. 
This people believes in inheritance and hierarchy, 
and while no other excels it in power and glory, 
it esteems itself as a nation and not as a people. 
As a people, it readily subordinates itself, and 
takes a lord as its head; the workman lets: him- 
self be despised ; the soldier puts up with flogging. 
Jt will be remembered that, at the battle of 
Inkerman, a sergeant who, as it appears, saved 
the British army, could not be mentioned by 
Lord Raglan, because the military hierarchy does 
not allow any hero below the rank of officer to 
be mentioned in dispatches. What we admire 
before all, in an encounter like Waterloo, is the 
prodigious skill of chance. The night raid, the 
wall of Hougomont, the hollow way of Ohain, 
Grouchy deaf to the cannon, Napoleon’s guide de- 
ceiving him, Bulow’s guide enlightening him— 
all this cataclysm is marvelously managed. 
Altogether, we will assert, there is ymore of 
a massacre than of a battle in Waterloof Water- 
loo, of all pitched battles, is the one“which had 
the smallest front for such a number of com- 
batants. Napoleon’s three-quarters of a league. 
Wellington’s half a league, and seventy-two thou- 
sand combatants on either side. From this den- 
sity came the carnage. The following calculation 
has been made and proportion established: loss 
of men, at Austerlitz, French, fourteen per cent.; 
Russian, thirty per cent.; Austrian, forty-four 
per cent.: at Wagram, French, thirteen per cent.; 
Austrian, fourteen per cent.: at Moscow, French, 
thirty-seven per cent.; Russian, forty-four per

thirty-one per cent.—total for Waterloo, forty- 
one per eent., or out of one hundred and forty- 
four thousand fighting men, sixty thousand killed. 
The field of Waterloo has at the present day 
that calmness which belongs to the earth, and 
resembles all plains; but at night, a sort of 
visionary mist rises from it, and if any traveler 
walk about it, and Hsten and dream, like Virgil 
on the mournful plain of Philippi, the hallucina- 
tion of the catastrophe seizes upon him. The 
frightful June 18th lives again, the falsé monu- 
mental hill is leveled, the wondrous lion is dis- 
sipated, the battle-field resumes its reality, lines 
of infantry undulate on the plain; furious gal- 
loping erosses the horizon; the startled dreamer 
sees the flash of sabers, the sparkle of bayonets, 
the red light of shells, the monstrous collision of 
thunderbolts; he hears, like a death groan from 
the tomb, the vague clamor of the fantom battle. 
These shadows are grenadiers; these flashes are 
euirassiers; this skeleton is Napoleon; this skel- 
eton is Wellington; all this is nonexistent, and 
yet still combats, and the ravines are stained 
purple, and the trees rustle, and there is fury 
even in the clouds and in the darkness, while 
all the stern heights, Mont St. Jean, Hougomont, 
Frischemont, Papelotte, and Plancenoit, seem 
confusedly crowned by hosts of specters exter- 
msinating one another.

THE BEGINNINGS AND EXPANSIONS OF 
PARIS?” 
Tuer Paris of three hundred and fifty years ago, 
the Paris of the fifteenth century, was already 
a gigantic city. We modern Parisians in general 
are much mistaken in regard to the ground which 
we imagine it has gained. Since the time of 
Louis XI Paris has not increased above one- 
third; and certes it has lost much more in beauty 
than it has acquired in magnitude. 
The infant Paris was born, as everybody knows, 
in that ancient island in the shape of a cradle, 
which is now called the City. The banks of 
that island were its first enclosure; the Seine 
was its first ditch. For several centuries Paris 
was confined to the island, having two bridges, 
the one on the north, the other on the south, 
the two tétes-de-ponts, which were at once its 
gates and its fortresses—the Grand Chatelet on 
the right bank and the Petit Chatelet on the 
left. In process of time, under the kings of 
the first dynasty, finding herself straitened in 
her island and unable to turn herself about, she 
crossed the water. A first enclosure of walls. 
and towers then began to encroach upon either 
bank of the Seine beyond the two Chatelets. 
Of this ancient enclosure some vestiges were 
still remaining in the past century; nothing is

Notre Dame.” From an anonymous, non-copyright transla- 
tion published by A. L. Burt Company.

  now left of it but the memory and here and there 
a tradition. By degrees the flood of houses, al- 
ways propelled from the heart to the extremities, 
wore away and overflowed this enclosure. 
Philip Augustus surrounded Paris with new 
ramparts. He imprisoned the city within a eir- 
‘eular chain of large, lofty, and massive towers. 
For more than a century the houses, crowding 
closer and closer, raised their level in this basin, 
like water in a reservoir. They began to grow 
higher; story was piled upon story; they shot 
up like any comprest liquid, and each tried to 
lift its head above its neighbors in order to obtain 
a little fresh air. The streets became deeper and 
deeper, and narrower and narrower; every vacant 
place was covered and disappeared. The houses 
at length overleapt the wall of Philip Augustus, 
and merrily scattered themselves at random over 
the plain, like prisoners who had made their es- 
cape. There they sat themselves down at their ease 
and carved themselves gardens out of the fields. 
So early as 1367 the suburbs of the city had 
spread so far as to need a fresh enclosure, espe- 
eially cn the right bank; this was built for it 
by Charles V. But a place like Paris is perpetu- 
ally inereasing. It is such cities alone that be- 
come eapitals of countries. They are reservoirs 
into which all the geographical, political, moral, 
and intellectual channels of a country, all the 
natural inclined planes of its population dis- 
charge themselves; wells of civilization, if we 
may be allowed the expression, and drains also, 
where all that constitutes the sap, the life, the 
soul of the nation, is incessantly collecting and 
filtering, drop by drop, age by age. 
236
-P-A-G-E-248
  VICTOR HUGO 
  The enclosure of Charles V consequently shared 
the same fate as that of Philip Augustus. 
early as the conclusion of the fifteenth century 
it was overtaken, passed, and the suburbs kept 
traveling onward. In the sixteenth it seemed 
very visibly receding more and more into the 
ancient city, so rapidly did the new town thicken 
on the other side of it. Thus, so far back as 
the fifteenth century, to come down no further, 
Paris had already worn out the three concentric 
eireles of walls which, from the time of Julian 
the Apostate, lay in embryo, if I may be allowed 
the expression, in the Grand and Petit Chatelets. 
The mighty city had successively burst its four 
mural belts, like a growing boy bursting the 
garments made for him a year ago. Under Louis 
XI there were still to be seen ruined towers of 
the ancient enclosures, rising at intervals above 
the sea of houses, like the tops of hills from 
amid an inundation, like the archipelagos of 
old Paris submerged beneath the new. 
Bach of these great divisions of Paris was, “as 
we have observed, a city, but a city too special 
to be complete, a city which could not do without 
the two others. Thus they had three totally 
different aspects. The City, properly so called, 
abounded in churches; the Ville contained the 
palaces; and the University, the colleges. Setting 
aside secondary jurisdictions, we may assume 
generally that the island was under the bishop, 
the right bank under the provost of the mer- 
chants, the left under the rector of the Univer- 
sity, and the whole under the provost of Paris, 
a royal and not a municipal officer. The City 
had the Cathedral of Notre Dame, the Ville the 
237
-P-A-G-E-249
  THE BEST OF THE WORLD'S CLASSICS 
  Louvre and the Hotel de Ville, and the Univer- 
sity the Sorbonne. The Ville contained the 
Halles, the City the Hotel Dieu, and the University 
! the Pré aux Cleres. For offenses committed by 
the students on the left bank, in their Pré aux 
Cleres, they were tried at the Palace of Justice - 
in the island, and punished on the right bank at 
Montfaucon, unless the rector, finding the Uni- 
versity strong and the king weak, chose to inter- 
fere; for it was a privilege of the scholars to be 
hung in their own quarter. 
Most of these privileges, be it remarked by 
the way, and some of them were more valuable 
than that just mentioned, had been extorted from 
different sovereigns by riots and insurrections. 
This is the invariable course—the king never 
grants any boon but what is wrung from him 
by the people. 
In the fifteenth century that part of the Seine 
comprehended within the enclosure of Paris eon- 
tained five islands: the Ile Louviers, then ecov- 
ered with trees and now with timber, the Ie 
aux Vaches, and the Ile Notre Dame, both un- 
inhabited and belonging to the bishop [in the 
seventeenth century these two islands were con- 
verted into one, which has been built upon and 
is now called the Isle of St. Louis]; lastly the 
City, and at its point the islet of the Passeur 
aux Vaches, since buried under the platform of 
the Pont Neuf. The City had at that time five 
bridges: three on the right—the bridge of Notre 
Dame and the Pont au Change of stone, and the 
Pont aux Meuniers of wood; two on the left— 
the Petit Pont of stone, and the Pont St. Michel 
of wood; all of them covered with houses. The 
238

  university had six gates, built by Philip Augus- 
tus; these were, setting out from the Tournelle, 
the Gate of St. Victor, the Gate of Bordelle, the 
Papal Gate, and the gates of St. Jaeques, St. 
Michel, and St. Germain. The Ville had six 
gates, built by Charles V, that is to say, be- 
ginning from the Tower of Billy, the gates of 
St.. Antoine, the Temple, St. Martin, St. Denis, 
Montmartre, and St. Honoré. All these gates 
were strong, and handsome, too, a circumstance 
which does not detract from strength. A wide, 
deep ditch, supplied by the Seine with water, 
which was swollen by the floods of winter to 
a running stream, encireled the foot of the wall 
all round Paris. At night the gates were closed, 
the river was barred at the two extremities of 
the city by stout iron chains, and Paris slept in 
uiet. 
a A bird’s-eye view of these three -towns, the 
City, the University, and the Ville, exhibited to 
the eye an inextricable knot of streets strangely 
jumbled together. It was apparent, however, at 
first sight that these three fragments of a city 
formed but a single body. The spectator per- 
ceived immediately two long parallel streets, with- 
out break or interruption, crossing the three cities, 
nearly in a right line, from one end to the other, 
from south to north, perpendicularly to the Seine, 
incessantly pouring the people of the one into 
the other, connecting, blending them together and 
converting the three into one. The first of these 
streets ran from the Gate of St. Jacques to the 
Gate of St. Martin; it was called in fhe University 
the street of St. Jacques, in the City Rue de la 
Juiverie, and in the Ville, the street of St. Mar- 
239

  tin; it crossed the river twice by the name of 
Petit Pont and Pont Notre Dame. The second, 
named Rue de la Harpe on the left bank, Rue 
de la Barillerie in the island, Rue St. Denis on 
the right bank, Pont St. Michel over one arm 
of the Seine, and Pont au Change over the other, 
Gate of St. Martin; it was called in the University 
to the Gate of St. Denis in the Ville. Still, tho 
they bore so many different names, they formed 
in reality only two streets, but the two mother- 
streets, the two great arteries of Paris. All the 
other veins of the triple city were fed by or 
discharged themselves into these. . 
What, then, was the aspect of this whole, 
viewed from the summit of the towers of Notre 
Dame in 1482? That is what we shall now at- 
tempt to describe. The spectator, on arriving 
breathless at that elevation, was dazzled by the 
chaos of roofs, chimneys, streets, bridges, belfries, 
towers and steeples. All burst at onee upon the 
eye—the carved gable, the sharp roof, the turret 
perched upon the angles of the walls, the. stone 
pyramids of the eleventh century, the slated obel- 
isk of the fifteenth, the round and naked keep 
of the castle, the square and embroidered tower 
of the church, the great and the small, the mas- 
sive and the light. The eye was long bewildered 
amid this labyrinth of heights and depths in 
which there was nothing but had its originality, 
its reason, its genius, its beauty, nothing but 
issued from the hand of art, from the humblest 
dwelling with its painted and carved wooden 
front, elliptical doorway, and overhanging stories, 
to the royal Louvre, which then had a colonnade 
of towers.

brought up short by knocking violently against 
the shoulder of a musketeer who was leaving: 
the apartments of M. De Treville. The young 
man staggered backward from the shock, uttering: 
a cry, or rather a yell. 
“Excuse me,’’ said D’Artagnan, trying to pass 
him, ‘‘but I am in a great hurry.’’ 
He had hardly placed his foot on the next step,. 
when he was stopt by the grasp of an iron wrist, 
on his sash, 
“You are in a great hurry!’’ eried the mus-

  ‘Cand you think that is enough apology for nearly 
knocking me down? Not so fast, my young man. 
I suppose you imagine that because you heard 
M. De Treville speaking to us rather brusquely 
to-day, that everybody may treat us in the same 
way? But you are mistaken, and it is as well 
you should learn that you are not M. De Tre- 
ville.’’ 
*‘Upon my honor,’’ replied D’Artagnan, recog- 
nizing Athos, who was returning to his room 
after having his wound drest, ‘‘upon my honor, 
it was an accident, and therefore I begged your 
pardon. I should have thought that was all that 
was necessary. I repeat that I am in a very 
great hurry, and I should be much obliged if you 
would let me go my way.’’ 
«‘Monsieur,’’ said Athos, loosening his hold, 
‘you are sadly lacking in courtesy, and one sees 
that you must have had a rustie upbringing.’’ 
D’Artagnan was by this time half-way down 
another flight; but on hearing Athos’s remark 
he stopt short. 
“My faith, monsieur!’’ exclaimed he, ‘‘how- 
ever rustic I may be, I shall not come to you to 
teach me manners.’’ 
“T am not so sure of that,’’ replied Athos. 
“*Oh, if I was only not in such haste,’’ cried 
D’Artagnan; ‘‘if only I was not pursuing some- body—” , 
‘Monsieur, you will find me without running 
after me. Do you understand ?’’ 
‘‘And where, if you please?’’ 
‘‘Near Carmes-Deschaux.’’ 
“(At what hour?’’ 
‘Twelve o’clock.’?

“Very good. At twelve I will be there’? 
‘¢And don’t be late, for at a gquarter-past 
twelve I will cut off your ears for you.’ ~ 
‘All right,’’ called out D’Artagnan, dashing 
on down-stairs after his man; ‘‘you may expect 
me at ten minutes before the hour.’?’ 
But he was not to escape so easily. At the street 
door stood Porthos, talking to a sentry, and 
between the two men there was barely space for 
a man to pass. D’Artagnan took it for granted 
that he could get through, and darted on, swift 
as an arrow, but he had not reckoned on the gale 
that was blowing. As he passed, a sudden gust 
wrapt Porthos’s mantle tight round him; and tho 
the owner of the garment could easily have freed him had he so chosen, for reasons of his own he 
preferred to draw the folds still closer. 
D’Artagnan, hearing the volley of oaths let 
fall by the musketeers, feared he might have 
damaged the splendor of the belt, and struggled 
to unwind himself; but when he at length freed 
his head, he found that like most things in this 
world the belt had two sides, and while the front 
bristled with gold, the back was mere leather; 
which explains why Porthos always had a cold 
and could not part from his mantle. 
*<Confound you!’’ cried Porthos, struggling in 
his turn, ‘‘have you gone mad, that you tumble 
over people like this?’’ 
‘¢xeuse me,’’ answered D’Artagnan, ‘‘but I 
am in a great hurry. I am pursuing some one, a? 
ae And I suppose that on such oceasions you 
Jeave your eyes behind you?’’ asked Porthos. 
‘*No,”’ replied D’Artagnan, rather nettled;

‘Sand thanks to my eyes, I often see things that 
other people don’t.’’ 
Possibly Porthos might have understood this 
allusion, but in any case he did not. .attempt to 
control his anger, and said sharply: 
‘‘Monsieur, we shall have to give you a lesson 
if you take to tumbling against the musketeers 
like this!’’ ~ 
“tA lesson, monsieur!’’ replied D’Artagnan; 
‘that is rather a severe expression.’’ 
“Tt is the expression of a man who is always 
aceustomed to look his enemies in the face.’’ 
“'Oh, if that is all, there is no fear of your 
turning your back on anybody,’’ and enchanted. 
at his own wit, the young man walked away in 
fits of laughter. 
Porthos foamed with rage, and rushed after 
D’Artagnan. 
‘‘By and by, by and by,’’ eried the latter; 
‘(when you have not got your mantle on.’’ 
“At one o’elock then, behind the Luxem- 
bourg.’’ 
‘All right; at one o’clock,’’ replied D’Artag- 
nan as he vanished around the corner. . 
Moreover, he had gotten himself into two fierce 
duels with two men, each able to kill three 
D’Artagnans; in a word, with two musketeers— 
beings he set so high that he placed them above 
all other men. 
‘It was a sad lookout. To be sure, as.the youth 
was certain to be killed by Athos, he was not 
much disturbed about Porthos. As hope is the 
last thing to die in a man’s heart, however, he 
ended by hoping that he might come out alive 
from both duels, even if dreadfully injured; and

on that supposition he scored himself 1 in this’ way 
for his conduct: 
“What a rattle-headed dunce’I am! That 
brave and unfortunate Athos was wounded right 
on that shoulder I ran against head foremost, 
like a ram.. The only thing that surprizes me 
is that he didn’t strike me dead. on the spot; 
he had provocation enough, for I must have hurt 
him savagely. As to Porthos—ch! as to Porthos 
that’s a funny affair !’? ; 
And the youth began to laugh aloud in spite 
of himself; looking round carefully, however, to 
see if his laughing alone in publie without ap- 
parent cause aroused any suspi¢ion. . . 
D’Artagnan, walking and soliloquizing, had 
come within a few steps of the Aiguillon House, 
and in front of it saw Aramis chatting gaily 
with three of the King’s Guards. Aramis also 
saw D’Artagnan; but not having forgotten that 
it was in his presence M. De Treville had got 
so angry in the morning, and as a witness of 
the rebuke was not at all pleasant, he pretended 
not to see him. D’Artagnan, on the other hand, 
full of his plans of conciliation and politeness, 
approached the young man with a profound bow 
accompanied by a most gracious smile. Aramis 
bowed slightly, but did not smile. Moreover, 
all four immediately broke off their conversation. 
D’Artagnan was not so dull as not to see he 
was not wanted; but he was not yet used enough 
to social customs to know how to extrieate him-

casting about for the least awkward manner of 
retreat, when he noticed that Aramis had let his 
handkerchief fall and (doubtless by mistake) 
put his foot on it. This seemed a favorable 
chance to repair his mistake of intrusion: he 
stooped down, and with the most gracious air he 
could assume, drew the handkerchief from under 
the foot in spite of the efforts made to detain 
it, and holding it out to Aramis, said: 
**T believe, sir, this is a handkerchief you 
would be sorry to lose?’’ 
The handkerchief was in truth richly em- 
broidered, and had a cornet and a coat of arms 
at one corner. Aramis blushed excessively, and 
snatched rather than took the handkerchief. 
‘*Ha! ha!’? exclaimed one of the guards, ‘‘will 
you. go on saying now, most disereet Aramis, that 
you are not on good terms with Madame de 
Bois-Tracy, when that gracious lady does you 
the favor of lending you her handkerchief !’’ 
Aramis darted at D’Artagnan one of those 
looks which tell a man that he has made a mortal 
enemy; then assuming his mild air he said: 
‘‘You are mistaken, gentlemen: this handker- 
chief is not mine, and I can not understand why 
this gentleman has taken it into his head to 
offer it to me rather than to one of you. And 
as a proof of what I say, here is mine in my 
poeket.’’ 
So saying, he pulled out his handkerchief, 
which was also not only a very dainty one, 
and of fine linen (tho linen was then costly), 
but was embroidered and without arms, bearing 
only a single cipher, the owner’s. 
This time D’Artagnan saw his mistake; but

Aramis’s friends were by no means econvineed, 
and one of them, addressing the young musketeer 
with pretended gravity, said: moos 
‘Tf things were as you make out, I should feel 
obliged, my dear Aramis, to reclaim it myself; 
for as you very well know, Bois-Tracy is an 
intimate friend of mine, and I ean not allow 
one of his wife’s belongings to be exhibited as 
a trophy.’’ 
“You make the demand clumsily,’’ replied 
Aramis; ‘‘and while I acknowledge the justice 
of your reclamation, I refuse it on account of 
the form.’’ 
“‘The fact is,’’ D’Artagnan put in hesitatingly, 
“J did not actually see the handkerchief fall 
from M, Aramis’s pocket. He had his: foot on 
it, that’s all, and I thought it was his.’’ 
‘*And you were deceived, my dear sir,’’ re- 
plied Aramis coldly, very little obliged for the 
explanation; then turning to the guard who had 
profest himself Bois-Tracy’s friend—‘‘Besides,’’ 
he went on, ‘‘I have reflected, my dear intimate 
friend of Bois-Tracy, that I am not less devotedly 
his friend than you can possibly be, so that this 
handkerchief is quite as likely to have fallen 
from your pocket as from mine!’’ 
“On my honor, no!’’ . 
‘You are about to swear on your honor, an 
I on my word; and then it will be pretty evident 
that one of us will have lied. Now here, Mon- 
taran, we will do better than that: let each take 
a half.’’ 
‘*Perfectly fair,’’ cried the other two guards- 
men; ‘‘the judgment of Solomon! Aramis, you 
are certainly full of wisdom!’’ .

They burst into a loud laugh, and as may. be 
supposed, the incident bore no other fruit. In 
a minute or two the conversation stopt, and the 
three guards and the musketeer, after heartily 
shaking hands, separated, the guards going one 
‘way and Aramis another. . 
“Now is the time to make my peace with this 
gentleman,’’ said D’Artagnan to himself, having 
stood on one side during all the latter part of 
the conversation; and in this good spirit drawing 
near to Aramis, who was going off without paying 
any attention to him, he said: 
“You will excuse me, I hope.’’ 
‘tah!’ interrupted Aramis, ‘‘permit me to 
observe to you, sir, that you have not aeted in 
this affair as a man of good breeding ought.’’ 
“‘What!’’ cried D’Artagnan, ‘‘do you sup- 
pose—’? 
“*T suppose that you are not a fool, and that 
| you knew very well, even tho you come from 
: Gaseony, that people do not stand on handker- 
ebiefs for nothing. What the devil! Paris is 
not paved with linen!’’ 
, ‘Sir, you do wrong in trying to humiliate 
me,’’ said D’Artagnan, in whom his native pug- 
nacity began to speak louder than his peaceful 
resolutions. ‘‘I come from Gascony, it is true; 
and since you know it, there is no need to tell 
you that Gaseons are not very patient, so that 
when they have asked pardon once, even for a 
folly, they think they have done at least as much 
again as they ought to have done.’’ 
“Sir, what I say to you about this matter,’’ 
said Aramis, ‘‘is not for the sake of hunting 
a quarrel. Thank Heaven, I am not a swash-

buckler, and being a musketeer only for a while, 
I only fight when I am forced to do so, and 
always with great reluctance; but this time the 
affair is serious, for here is a lady compromised 
by you.’”” : 
“By us, you mean,’’ cried D’Artagnan. 
‘Why did you give me back the handkerchief 
so awkwardly ?’’ 
‘Why did you let it fall so awkwardly?’’ 
“T have said that the handkerchief did not 
fall from my pocket.’’ . 
**Well, by saying that you have told two lies, 
sir; for I saw it fall.’’ 
“Oh ho! you take it up that way, do you, 
Master Gascon? Well, I will teach you how to 
behave yourself.’’ 
‘And I will send you back to your pulpit, 
Master Priest. Draw, if you please, and in-

There I will point out the best place and time

The two bowed and separated. Aramis went 
up the street which led to the Luxembourg; while 
D’Artagnan, seeing that the appointed hour was 
eoming near, took the road to the ‘Carmes-Des-

hope to come out of these scrapes alive; but if 
I am doomed to be killed, it will be by a royal

Dupin, Baroness Dudevant; entered a convent in Paris in 
1817, remaining until 1820; married in 1822; sought a life 
of independence in 1831 with Jules Sandeau, with whom she 
collaborated in writing; became an advanced Republican, 
active in politics; wrote for newspapers and started a uews- 
paper of her own; published “Indiana” in 1831, “Consuelo” 
in 1842; “Elle et Lui” in 1858; “Nanon” in 1872; author 
of many other books. 
  LELIA AND THE POET* 
“Tux prophets are erying in the desert to-day, 
and no voice answers, for the world is indifferent 
and deaf: it lies down and stops its ears so as 
to die in peace. A few scattered groups of weak 
votaries vainly try to rekindle a spark of virtue. 
As the last remnants of man’s moral power, they 
will float for a moment about the abyss, then go 
and join the other wrecks at the bottom of that 
shoreless sea which will swallow up the world.’’ 
“(QO Lélia, why do you thus despair of those 
sublime men who aspire to bring virtue back 
to our iron age? Even if I were as doubtful 
of their success as you are, I would not say so. 
I should fear to commit an impious crime.’’ 
, From “Lélia,” which was published in 1833, during an 
eventful period in its author's life. The character of Lélia 
was drawn from George Sand herself as 9 personification of 
human nature at war with itself. The original of Sténio 
war Alfred de Musset, whose intimate friendship with the 
author is historic,

‘J admire those men,’’ said Lélia, ‘‘and would . 
like to be the least among them. But what will 
those shepherds bearing a star on their brows 
be able to do before the huge monster of the 
Apocalypse—before that immense and terrible 
figure outlined in the foreground of all the proph- 
ets’ pictures? That woman, as pale and beauti- 
ful as vice—that great harlot of nations, decked 
with the wealth of the Kast, and bestriding a 
hydra belehing forth rivers of poison on all hu- 
man pathways—is Civilization; is humanity de- 
moralized by luxury and science; is the torrent 
of venom which will swallow up all virtue, all 
hope of regeneration.’’ 
*Q Lélia!’’ exclaimed the poet, struck by 
superstition, ‘‘are not you that terrible and un- 
happy fantom? How many times this fear has 
taken possession of my dreams! How many 
times you have appeared to me as the type of 
the unspeakable agony to which the spirit of 
inquiry has driven man! With your beauty and 
your sadness, your weariness and your skepticism, 
do you ‘not personify the excess of sorrow pro- 
‘duced by the abuse of thought? Have you not 
given up, and as it were prostituted, that moral 
power, so highly developed by what art, poetry, 
and seience have done for it, to every new im- 
pression and error? Instead of clinging faith- 
fally and prudently to the simple ereed of your 
fathers, and to the instinctive indifference God 
has.implanted in man for his peace and preserva- 
tion; instead of confining yourself to a pious 
life free from vain show, you have abandoned 
yourself to all the seductions of ambitious philos- 
ophy. You have cast yourself into the torrent 
251
-P-A-G-E-263
cr

  of civilization rising to destroy, and which by 
dashing along too swiftly has ruined the scarcely 
laid foundations of the future. And because 
you have delayed the work of centuries for a 
few days, you think you have shattered the hour- 
glass of Eternity. There is much pride in this 
grief, Lélia! But God will make this billow of 
stormy centuries, that for him are but a drop 
in the ocean, float by. The devouring hydra will 
perish for lack of food; and from its world- 
covering corpse a new race will issue, stronger 
and more patient than the old.’’ . 
‘*You see far into the future, Sténio! You 
personify Nature for me, and are her unspotted 
child. You have not yet blunted your faculties: 
you believe yourself immortal because you feel 
yourself young and like that untilled valley now 
blooming in pride and beauty-——never dreaming 
that in a single day the plowshare and the hun- 
dred-handed monster called industry can tear its 
bosom to rob it of its treasures; you are growing 
up full of trust and presumption, not foreseeing 
your coming life, which will drag you down 
under the weight of its errors, disfigure you with 
the false colors of its promises. Wait, wait a 
few years, and you too will say, ‘All is passing 
away!’’? 
‘*No, all is not -passing away!’’ said Sténio. 
‘‘Look at the sun, and the earth, and the beauti- 
ful sky, and these green hills; and even that 
iee, winter’s fragile edifice, which has withstood 
the rays of summer for centuries. Even so man’s 
frail power will prevail! What matters the fall 
of a few generations? Do you weep for so 
slight a thing, Lélia? Do you deem it possible

  a single idea ean die in the universe? Will not 
that imperishable inheritance be found intact in 
the dust of our extinct races, just as the inspira- 
tions of art and the discoveries of science arise 
alive each day from the ashes of Pompeii or the 
tombs of Memphis? Oh,: what a great and 
striking proof of intellectual immortality! Deep 
mysteries had been lost in thé night of time; 
the world had forgotten its age, and thinking 
itself still young, was alarmed at feeling itself 
so old. It said as you do, Lélia: ‘I am about 
to end, for I am growing weak, and I was born 
but a few days ago! How few I shall need for 
dying, since so few were needed for living!’ 
But one day human corpses were exhumed from 
the bosom of Egypt—Egypt that had lived out 
its period of civilization, and has just lived its 
period of barbarism! Egypt, where the ancient 
light, lost so long, is being rekindled, and a rested 
and rejuvenated Egypt may perhaps soon come 
and establish herself upon the extinguished torch 
of our. own. Egypt, the living image of her 
mummies sleeping under the dust of ages, and 
now awaking to the broad daylight of science 
in order to reveal the age of the old world to 
the new! Is this not solemn and terrible, Lélia? 
Within the dried-up entrails of a human corpse 
the inquisitive glance of our century discovered 
the papyrus, that mysterious and sacred monu- 
ment of man’s eternal power—the still dark but 
incontrovertible witness of the imposing dura- 
tion of creation. Our eager hand unrolls those 
perfumed. bandages, those frail and indissoluble 
shrouds at which destruction stopt short. These 
bandages that once enfolded a corpse, these man-

  uscripts that have rested under fieshless ribs in 
the place once occupied perhaps by a soul, are 
human thought; exprest in the science of signs, 
and transmitted by the help of an art we had 
lost, but have found again in the sepulchers of 
the East—the art of preserving the remains of 
the dead from the outrages of corruption—the 
greatest power in the universe. O Lélia, deny 
the youth of the world if you can, when you 
see it stop in artless ignorance before the lessons 
of the past, and begin to live on the forgotten 
ruins of an unknown world.’’ 
‘Knowledge is not power,’’ replied Lélia. 
‘Learning over again is not progress; seeing 
is not living. Who will give us back the power 
to act, and above all, the art of enjoying and 
retaining? We have gone too far forward now 
to retreat. What was merely repose for eclipsed 
civilizations will be death for our tired-out one; 
the rejuvenated nations of the East will come 
and intoxicate themselves with the poison we 
have poured on our soil. The bold barbarian 
drinkers may perhaps prolong the orgy of luxury 
a few hours into the night of time; but the venom 
we shall bequeath them will promptly be mortal 
for them, as it was for us, and all will drop back 
into blackness. . 
‘*In fact, Sténio, do you not see that the sun 
is withdrawing from us? Is not the earth, 
wearied in its journey, noticeably drifting toward 
darkness and chaos? Is your blood so young 
and ardent as not to feel the touch of that chill 
spread like a pall over this planet abandoned 
to Fate, the most powerful of the gods? Oh,

needles into every pore. That curst breath that 
withers fidwers and burns them like fire; that 
pain at once physical and mental, which invades 
both soul and body, penetrates to the depths of 
thought, and paralyzes mind as well as blood! 
Cold—the sinister demon who grazes the universe 
with his damp wing, and breathes pestilence on 
bewildered nations! Cold, tarnishing everything, 
unrolling its gray and nebulous veil over the 
sky’s rich tints, the waters’ reflections, the hearts 
of flowers, and the cheeks of maidens! Cold, 
that casts its white winding-sheet over fields and 
woods and lakes, even over the fur and feathers 
of animals! Cold, that discolors all in the mate- 
rial as well as in the intellectual world; not only 
the coats of bears and hares on the shores of 
Archangel, but the very pleasures of man and 
the character of his habits in the spots it ap- 
proaches! You surely see that everything is 
being civilized; that is to say, growing cold. The 
bronzed nations of the torrid zone are beginning 
to open their timid and suspicious hands to the 
snares of our skill; lions and tigers are. being 
tamed, and come from the desert to amuse the 
peoples of the north. Animals which had never 
been able to grow accustomed to our climate, 
now leave their warm sun without dying, to live 
in domesticity among us, and even forget the 
proud and bitter sorrow which used to kill them 
when enslaved. It is because blood is congealing 
and growing poorer everywhere, while instinct 
grows and develops. The soul rises and leaves 
the earth, no longer sufficient for her needs.

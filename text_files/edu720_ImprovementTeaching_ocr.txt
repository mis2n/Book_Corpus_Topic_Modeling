PREFACE 
THE reader of this book should understand that it is 
based throughout upon the observation of teaching. 
The work of successful teachers was given first consid- 
eration in accordance with the principle that a program 
which had already proved successful might be sub- 
stituted for any type of failure. This made it possible 
to keep the discussion constructive. The. plan also 
avoids any assumption on the part of the writer, who 
frankly admits that his own opinions of what may 
constitute successful teaching have been modified many 
times during this study. 
The success of teachers was judged upon the basis 
of the following norms : 
1. Enjoyment, or lack of it, in the work of teaching. 
2. Advancement by school officers in salary and in 
types of position held. 
3. Judgment of superintendent, principal, super- 
visor, and capable fellow teachers. 
4. Attitude of children and parents toward the 
teacher. 
5. As rated by teacher measurement sheets. 
6. Occasionally it was possible to study teachers 
when classes were being measured in different 
subjects by standardized tests. The results were 
vu

viii PREFACE 
used whenever they seemed to throw light upon 
the ability of the teacher. 
It was not always possible to use all the dif- 
ferent norms, nor were they used mechanically. 
They served as a basis of judgment. 
The teachers observed were divided into three classes, 
superior, average, and inferior. The three groups were 
then studied in order to establish, if possible, the 
essential differences. After the special factors in the 
teaching of superior teachers that distinguish them 
from average or inferior teachers had been catalogued, 
they were grouped in a plan for the improvement of 
teaching. This plan has been given several years’ 
trial in the training of both beginners and experienced 
teachers. It has finally become a growing body of 
suggestions involving many issues that have already 
been discussed in literature on the subject of teaching. 
The hope that the plan of improvement might take a 
definite form has gradually given way to a willingness 
to present a group of suggestive and more or less un- 
finished chapters, for the problems of teaching are too 
complex and as yet too much unsolved to lend them- 
selves to any set scheme of solution. 
The material has been prepared for three types of 
readers. First consideration was given to students 
preparing for the teaching profession. It is hoped 
that in the descriptions of the work of superior teachers 
they will read the message of thorough training followed

by continuous growth as long as they remain in this 
important work. Improvement in teaching is less 
difficult when established in the mind of the beginner 
as a part of his preparation. The illustrations and 
discussions have been planned especially for classes in 
methods of teaching and for curriculum courses. Next 
in importance are the teachers in service. This de- 
scription of how successful teachers have developed 
may furnish information as well as inspiration for 
many who are desirous of advancing. Lastly it is 
hoped that the general public, parents, school boards, 
and those who support public education may read 
this report as well as other studies in education in order 
that the demand for better teaching may increase and 
that superior work may be appreciated. 
In conclusion acknowledgments are made to the 
following persons: to Prof. James C. DeVoss for 
advice on some of the issues in the three chapters that 
deal with the principles of testing ; to Dr. W. C. Bagley 
for a fine criticism which has helped especially in 
keeping each phase of the discussion constructive and 
of service to teachers ; and to the Macmillan Company 
for its most valuable editorial service. Mention 
should also be made of the splendid codperation of the 
many teachers whose work has furnished a basis for 
the book, and special credit should be given to Miss 
Roxanna Adams, who furnished some of the most 
valuable illustrations, and to Miss Belle Melvin, who 
provided the illustrations for Chapter XII.

  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
As a group, books on the art of teaching have had 
an unfortunate reputation of dealing far too exclusively 
with abstractions and generalizations. In an effort 
to meet this criticism, some writers have swung to the 
opposite extreme. They have tried to avoid theory 
entirely and have limited themselves to a thoroughly 
empirical statement of what they believe to be “good 
practice.” Between these two extremes is the most 
helpful type of book, — the book that sets forth clearly 
and concretely the procedure that seems to be the 
best from every reasonable point of view, — and then, 
often explicitly, sometimes by implication, — indicates 
the principles or hypotheses that offer the best justi- 
fication for the approved practice. 
Dr. Freeland’s book impresses the editor and will, 
we are sure, impress the reader as an excellent example 
of this third method of treating the intricate and im- 
portant problems of the classroom teacher. His man- 
ner of writing the book is itself presumptive evidence 
that he has something of value to contribute. He has 
visited thousands of classrooms and studied intimately 
the work of thousands of teachers. He has tried to 
xi 
 
-P-A-G-E-14
  xii EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
find what good teachers do and how they do it. He 
has described successful practices vividly and con- 
cretely. 
The result is a most useful collection of case-studies 
in the art of teaching ; — but it is also something more. 
As in his earlier book, Modern Elementary School Prac- 
tice, the author is an exponent of ideals. His aim is 
not merely to describe but to interpret. He hopes 
that what he has found in good schools and with good 
teachers can be made an object lesson to other schools 
and other teachers. But if this is to be done, the vir- 
tues must be lifted out of the particular setting in which 
he found them, and given a wider significance. This 
is the large task of interpretation, and this the author 
has accomplished in a peculiarly effective way.

The children who took part in this project voluntarily came to school early and remained after dismissal. 
They spent Saturdays in the public library, and when the work was completed they had read ten times as 
much as was required in the course of study, and had developed an interest in Switzerland that will stay with 
them through life. (See Chapters IV, V, XI, and XII)

THE IMPROVEMENT 
OF TEACHING 
CHAPTER I 
HOW SUCCESSFUL TEACHERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED 
ConcLUSIONS FROM StuDYING SUCCESSFUL 
TEACHERS 
The Purpose of This Chapter. —In the preface the 
statement is made that these discussions are based upon 
a study of teaching, that the work of superior teach- 
ers in six different states was studied with the hope of . 
finding common principles that may be adopted by 
teachers everywhere. One of the most obvious of 
these principles is that of development. The superior 
teacher is continually growing. Therefore, the first 
point of interest for the teacher who desires to improve 
will, without doubt, be a description of the different 
factors that influenced the growth of those who became 
superior. 
The Importance of Educational Training. — After 
making this study, the conclusion that the fine points in 
good teaching are largely a matter of education followed 
by practice in application could not be escaped. In- 
telligence and health were the only factors dependent 
1

  2 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
upon birth alone, and in the majority of cases the 
element of health was dependent largely upon training. 
There are natural variations in the capacity to develop 
teaching ability; the parental instinct is stronger in 
some than in others and there are those who enjoy 
teaching more than others; but it is safe to predict 
that one who relies upon his natural advantages is 
likely to fail in his work if he attempts without educa- 
tional training to teach in the schools of to-day. 
Probably the best proof of the fact that successful 
teachers are developed for the most part rather than 
“born” is furnished by a group of several hundred 
who were studied to discover causes of success or failure. 
When from this group all who showed the slightest 
evidence of lacking in intelligence were excluded, the 
great majority still remained. To some of these intel- 
ligence tests were given, and a number of exceptionally 
high scores were made. 
Why did many of these capable persons succeed as 
teachers while others failed? Why were some found 
teaching in a superior way while others taught in a 
mechanical, traditional fashion? In almost every 
case it was found that the possession of knowledge and 
training by the superior teacher made the difference. 
Many teachers did not know that new and better ways 
of teaching had been devised. They had not been 
convinced that education is being reévaluated, and 
that activities once regarded as essential are now being 
discarded.
-P-A-G-E-23
  HOW TEACHERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED 3 
In many cases, when suggestions for improvement 
were properly presented, it took only a short time to 
bring about an entire reversal of attitude and methods. 
But, ordinarily, the essential elements of the modern 
point of view cannot be acquired without studying 
them, living with them, and working with them for 
a long while. 
Illustrations of Growth and Change. — Those who 
grow find it advantageous to change. Many make 
a gradual growth from the first. Some begin to teach 
without the training necessary for the proper point of 
view. Many of these report that they have been awak- 
ened by reading, by going to school, or through con- 
tact with persons who have studied educational prob- 
lems. In every case the result is renewed interest in 
life and in daily work. The zeal for self-reform and 
the realization that teaching is replete with interesting 
problems usually was enough to make them enthusi- 
astic in their work. 
Among elementary-school teachers there are two 
types in the group rated superior: (1) the type that 
experiences new vision after a few years of doubtful 
experience; and (2) the type that makes a sure 
growth from the beginning which results from the right 
kind of training followed by stimulating environment 
while teaching. 
Illustration of Type I.— Teacher in third grade; ex- 
perience, 17 years; training, normal school graduation. 
After ten years of experience in which considerable growth

was made, to use her own words, “‘had settled down without 
much hope for further growth and little interest in the teach- 
ing profession.”” Was stimulated by a supervisor to take a 
summer at a State Normal School, followed this by a summer 
at the State University. Became enthusiastic, read widely, 
received recognition from the superintendent’s office, was 
advanced twice. Became so active, well read, and co- 
operative that she was made principal of an elementary 
school. 
Illustration of Type II.— Teacher in fifth grade; ex- 
perience, 6 years, graduated from a normal school and had 
attended three summer sessions. Read the latest professional 
books, was a subscriber to three educational magazines. 
Did thorough work in the fundamentals, was enthusiastic 
for problems and projects. Every one who came in contact 
with her work reported favorably. She reported that she 
could see herself growing each year and looked back upon 
her earlier efforts with a great deal of amusement at some 
of her blunders. Is planning to go to school for special train- 
ing. She has all the odds in her favor. 
Many striking illustrations could be reported. The 
Dean of the School of Law of one of our great state 
universities reported that he had been teaching twenty- 
five years, but that during the last year he had changed 
his methods of teaching throughout. He illustrates 
the type of teacher who teaches not only his subject, 
but establishes in his students the habit of growth 
which causes them to continue to develop long after they 
have left his classes, his own changing point of view 
being the stimulus. He took great pleasure in bring- 
ing about the change. Teaching, he reported, seemed
-P-A-G-E-25
  
HOW TEACHERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED 5 
more interesting in the twenty-fifth year than it had 
at any time before. 
Many of the educational principles that this man 
was learning are now taught to beginners. He is a 
brilliant man with little or no training in education. 
At the time he went to school, it was assumed by most 
persons that such training was unnecessary or impos- 
sible. 
On our list is the case of the president of a university, 
who resigned from his position when he realized that 
education, to the extent that facts can be gathered, 
should be made a science. After resigning he spent 
several years in an eastern graduate school studying 
education. He finally regained practically everything 
he had lost and was recently honored by being appointed 
to one of the highest educational positions in the 
United States. It is not necessary to resign in order 
to study but the action of this man was eventually 
vindicated. 
Factors Iv DEVELOPMENT 
A Long and Gradual Process. — Teachers who be- 
come superior show that fifteen and twenty years of 
experience are not enough to terminate advancement. 
This factor was rather difficult to study, but out of all 
those observed it was possible to get a full record of 
the progress of a fair number of exceptional teachers. 
Conversation with those who failed was usually enough 
to show that during the first two years their interest 
 
-P-A-G-E-26
eT Tne ee 
6 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
in improvement had become satisfied. Many of them 
did their best work the first year they taught. 
Three Important Factors. — This gradual advance- 
ment went along as the result of several forces. First 
should be mentioned the desire to improve, a type 
of self-supervision that kept the teacher at work trying 
to improve himself. Second, was education that came 
from reading, attendance at schools during regular ses- 
sions or in the summer, from correspondence courses, 
and from teachers’ institutes. Third, was contact 
with other human beings who stimulated this desire to 
do better. Among these were found superintendents, 
supervisors, principals, and fellow teachers.   ProGRESS THROUGH SELF-SUPERVISION 
Practical Application. — Along with self-supervision 
went the impulse to apply everything good that was 
learned. One very successful man remarked, when 
asked to explain his methods of work, ‘“‘I read and 
hear of new and better ways of working, and, at the 
first opportunity, I try them. Of course, I have 
learned the folly of’ rushing in headlong, but I love 
to take chances, especially when there is likelihood of 
being able to do something in a better way than I 
have ever done it before. I believe I have formed a 
habit of working in this way.”’ In other words, he had 
formed the habit of growing, of constantly working to im- 
prove, and, as he has stated, by so doing became adept in 
changing his methods and at the same time avoiding trouble.
-P-A-G-E-27
  HOW TEACHERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED 7 
The teacher who advances in the profession uses his 
classroom as a laboratory. He is careful not to com- 
promise in any way his instruction, but it is only 
through varying his methods of procedure that he is 
able to advance. Teaching is in this way made as 
interesting as is investigation in any field of science. 
Each day holds the possibility of a new discovery. 
A word about troubles may not come amiss here. 
Every one who succeeds to any extent as a teacher 
will meet his share of trouble. Success in teaching, 
as well as in every other calling, is largely a matter of 
learning to meet troubles and gain strength by assimi- 
lating them. Overcoming difficulties brings true pleas- 
ure. The most successful teachers observed in this 
study are, from one standpoint, all veterans of many 
wars. They grew strong and rugged fighting in good 
causes. They learned to smile in the midst of difficul- 
ties that would have disheartened those who were con- 
tent to remain below them. They also learned how 
to keep happy and pleasant to others regardless of 
their personal troubles. Many of the troubles of 
teachers never happen. One is sure to fail if he allows 
every small cloud that darkens the horizon to frighten 
him away when he is doing good work. 
A Program for Self-Improvement.— No one im- 
proves as he should unless he studies himself con- 
stantly. He must learn to criticize himself; to 
criticize constructively and effectively. Self-improve- 
ment is usually helped by working with a definite plan.
-P-A-G-E-28
  8 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
Those with broad educations, wide experience, and 
large contacts, manage to get along without consciously 
making a program for themselves, but some very suc- 
cessful persons report that they have received a great 
deal of help from such a scheme. The teacher who 
would improve must have established purposes with 
which he lives. He should be moving along in well- 
balanced progress. Lack of ideals, one-sided and un- 
balanced enthusiasm, and effort without a definite 
purpose are often causes of lack of advancement on 
the part of otherwise intelligent teachers. 
When one determines where he wants to go and con- 
tinues along the same lines of progress for a few years, 
he is sure to be able to show results that are worth 
while, providing his plan is a good one. Once estab- 
lishing such a plan, he must be willing to modify it 
as he grows; but a general scheme that has been well 
thought out is not likely to be entirely done away with 
by progress. 
From a number of such schemes with the help of 
classes in supervision, made up mostly of successful 
superintendents and supervisors, the one that follows 
was compiled.

  10 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
How to Use the Self-Measurement Sheet. — This 
self-measurement sheet has proved popular. It has 
been mimeographed and presented by superintendents 
to teachers in several large cities. To many of these 
teachers the scope of the scheme seemed burdening. 
But the idea behind it makes it helpful, rather than 
obnoxious, to the teacher who desires to improve. 
Few could be expected to approach perfection in all 
the ten departments. In any case, we have here a 
scheme that is worthy of years of pleasant effort. No 
one measures the teacher with this sheet. It merely 
invites him to measure himself. 
In self-improvement the teacher is asked to consider 
the following points: 
1. Remember that self-improvement is one essen- 
tial element of success. 
2. That a well-thought-out scheme is better than 
sporadic efforts. 
3. That it takes time to improve. 
4. That time spent in improving oneself brings more 
pleasure than does merely marking time. 
5. That fifteen or even thirty years may be spent 
with such a scheme as is outlined here without reach- 
ing its limits. 
6. That a single year of conscientious effort in the 
use of such a plan has proved sufficient to lift in- 
telligent teachers above the level of average perform- 
ance. 
The self-measurement plan presented is not theo- 
 
-P-A-G-E-31
HOW TEACHERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED 11 
retical. It has been used with success by numerous 
teachers. The reader is advised to try it. 
DEVELOPMENT AND EpucaTION 
Limits for Proper Training in School. — Many are 
forced by circumstances to teach without proper train- 
ing. The minimum and maximum training of suc- 
cessful teachers sums up about as follows. For a 
minimum, grade teachers should aim at graduation 
from a good normal school; high school teachers should 
not feel content without a bachelor’s degree; and 
those in higher institutions should not think of being 
satisfied with anything less than a master’s degree, 
while in some departments the doctorate is indispen- 
‘sable. For a maximum, grade and high-school teachers 
may well work for the master’s degree. In many cities 
such work is now recognized by increased salary. 
Suggestions Relative to Going to School after Be- 
ginning to Teach. — The proper point of view on the 
question of training is often as valuable as is the train- 
ing. The high-school teacher without his degree, by 
recognizing the fact that he needs it and by working 
accordingly, is frequently superior to many who have 
it. Too often the individual is content to rest on his 
laurels. This is why a degree may at times be dan- 
gerous. The following brief suggestions seem war- 
ranted by the facts observed. 
The great majority of successful teachers went to 
school again after they began to teach. Such schoo}
-P-A-G-E-32
a ee 
12 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
ing is rarely regretted. All the saving, planning, and 
working necessary, when one is engaged in a calling 
of such limited remuneration as is teaching and at the 
same time is working to further his education, cannot 
be pictured asa sinecure. Hard work, good work, work 
at times against fearful odds, is sure to be his lot. 
Let all those who cannot enjoy such a life stay away 
from the teaching profession. 
Therefore, the growing teacher should plan from the 
first, if he does not have the maximum education for 
his work, to go to school. As a rule, combination of 
experience and training seems to be more profitable 
than complete schooling at the beginning. The best 
scheme seems to be that which begins with the mini- 
mum as suggested above and works towards the maxi- 
mum. The inexperienced youth does not get as much 
from the final stages in his training as he would get 
after a few years of experience. Other facts indicate, 
however, that it is dangerous to put off further school- 
ing too long. 
After going out to teach, the mediocre teacher with- 
out sufficient training as indicated above does not 
as a rule renew his attendance at school. He finds 
numerous “ perfectly valid ” reasons for his conduct. 
However, our study has revealed that, ordinarily, 
money spent for expensive but not practical clothing, 
at summer resorts, for over-expensive automobiles, 
and for numerous unnecessary luxuries could have 
sent through school many teachers who complained
-P-A-G-E-33
  HOW TEACHERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED 13 
that they could not afford to go. Energy wasted in 
numerous unwholesome pastimes could have been em- 
ployed at school with profit to their health by many 
of those who complained that they “ could not stand 
the strain of attending school and teaching between 
times.”” Those who thought they found more profit 
in engaging in business “on the side” to the neglect 
of further training frequently awoke to the fact that 
it is rare indeed that a teacher who intends to remain 
a teacher can find a side line more profitable than the 
acquisition of the maximum training for success in his 
profession. 
Development from Reading.— The extent of a 
teacher’s success can usually be predicted if one is ac- 
quainted with his reading habits. At any rate those 
who read nothing or at most the daily newspaper 
and current popular fiction are likely to remain 
stationary. 
Without further statement of values, taking for 
granted that they cannot be disputed, a plan of reading 
for development is given here. A plan is always better 
than casual effort. Even when it is not followed 
throughout, the fact that it is in the background usually 
brings eventual advantage. For years one may fail 
to live up to his scheme, then finally reach the point 
where he can realize upon it. 
1. Reading for Professional Development. — In this 
connection the teacher should keep in contact with 
the half-dozen magazines that best represent the
-P-A-G-E-34
    | 
14 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
special field in which he is interested. When possible, 
and with a little effort on the part of some interested 
person this is usually possible, magazines should be 
provided for the teachers. When the school board 
cannot be prevailed upon, the teachers may form a 
club and get them. The teacher in a one-room rural 
school will never regret spending a few dollars a year 
in this way. Sometimes the board is willing to pay 
as much as the teachers. It is usually found that 
where there is a will there is a way, and a way that is 
not burdensome to anyone. 
At this writing the following list,! although not 
complete, may prove suggestive. It has been used 
with success by the teachers of Cleveland and other 
places.

It is interesting to note that, of all those observed 
and from whom it was possible to get reports, the teacher 
who made the most progress (promotions, gain in salary, 
etc.) during the last year spends seventeen dollars a year 
for educational magazines. It should be added that this 
is a trivial amount compared to that a carpenter or a 
painter spends yearly for tools. Many teachers save 
 
-P-A-G-E-37
  HOW TEACHERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED 17 
at their own expense when they refuse to provide them- 
selves with such tools as the current educational maga- 
zines. 
As to books, it is always possible to find standard 
educational treatises at public libraries. In the maga- 
zines listed above, advertisements, announcements, 
and especially book reviews will furnish information 
on all new educational books. Many teachers have 
found that their school boards are quite willing to 
supply professional books. It is a “‘ paying proposi- 
tion” for a school board to furnish such books when 
the teachers ask for them. One could not be so sure 
of the value if the board supplied them without special 
request from the teachers. A list of books that have 
proved useful to superior teachers may be found in 
the appendix of this book. Two plans for professional 
reading are: 
1. The teacher will find it profitable to keep in con- 
tact with the writings of leading students of education. 
Many of the successful teachers on our list report that 
they take pride in being students of the works of Thorn~ 
dike, Judd, Dewey, Cubberley, Suzzallo, McMurry, 
Bagley, Terman, and other educational leaders. 
2. Compile a list of subjects upon which the year’s 
reading will focus. At present the list might profitably 
be made up of such topics as the project method, how 
to study, mental tests, educational measurements, 
and studies of the curriculum. It is often well to make 
one of these the central theme.

2. Reading for General Development. — As the teacher 
grows older he is sure to find his general reading a 
constant help in the continuance of growth. Presi- 
dent Eliot of Harvard placed instructive general read- 
ing at the head of the list of factors that make for 
growth in any occupation. He also stated as his con- 
viction the absolute impossibility of development for 
all those who did not form this habit. A good plan 
for general reading is to make a list of books to be read 
during a year. Then, without allowing it to limit the 
amount of reading, use it as a guide. With such a 
list, it has been proved a number of times, one tends 
to do some regular reading. Otherwise he is likely 
to have the feeling that he should be doing some de- 
velopmental reading, that it ‘would certainly be a 
good thing,” or that he is “ getting fearfully behind ” 
in the reading of good literature, but this is about as far 
as he ever gets. Do not fail to make up lists of books 
that you intend to read. One man whose instructive 
reading had played an important part in making him 
a great educator, reported that he had formed the habit 
of jotting down in a notebook the title of every worth- 
while book he heard of. He used this notebook in 
making up his reading lists. 
The following is a list of books made up at the be- 
ginning of the school year and read during the year 
by a rural-school teacher. She reported that she 
“would not have missed it for anything.”? She also 
said that she was sure that very little reading of this
-P-A-G-E-39
HOW TEACHERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED 19 
type would have been done, had she not planned for 
it. Her year’s list, together with her comments upon 
the different books may prove inspirational. 
Life of Lincoln. —Ida M. Tarbell. “Those two volumes 
show Lincoln as he really was. They picture his struggles 
against the world and with himself. They have left with 
me thoughts that are sure to influence my thinking, and 
possibly my actions, as long as I live.” 
Fathers and Children. — Turganev. ‘I gained from this a 
picture of political life in Russia before the World War, an 
insight into Russian character, and acquired knowledge of 
Russia that helped me to understand the life that is lived 
there. This book has proved an invaluable background for 
the recent news in which Russia plays so conspicuous a 
part.” 
Dame Care.—Suderman. ‘Gives an idea of the super- 
stition that hedges in the life of the German peasant.” 
The Unsocial Socialist.— Bernard Shaw. ‘Shows the 
difficulty of practicing our political theories. I followed this 
by reading considerable of Shaw and finally concluded that 
he was chiefly interested in making money by writing books 
that would be interesting to idle women of the upper 
classes.”’ ? 
The Mikado and other plays. — Gilbert and Sullivan. 
The Bluebird. — Maeterlinck. ‘Gave me an insight into 
Belgian peasant life.” 
Ghosts and The Master Builder.—TIbsen. “One should 
read some Ibsen. I believe his psychology of life is warped 
or, at least, based upon too much attention to the terrors 
of passing middle age.” 
1The reader should keep in mind that these are the comments of a 
rural-school teacher. They are given to show how her reading influ- 
enced her thinking.
-P-A-G-E-40
    20 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
Thus Spake Zarathustra. — Nietzsche. “‘You say unto 
me that a good cause halloweth any war, but I say unto you 
that a good war halloweth any cause.’ This sentence is one 
from Nietzsche that always comes to mind when I hear him 
mentioned.” 
She also read some of H. G. Wells, Schopenhauer, 
Galsworthy, Kipling, and considerable biography. 
She reports that she could have read many more books 
than she did. Anyone who will conscientiously try 
to read a list of books like the above during a school 
year is very likely to receive so much benefit that he 
will be sure to plan his reading for each year thereafter. 
He will grow to expect this as one of the most inter- 
esting phases of living; and while he is living in this 
way, life will be more interesting because such reading 
is sure to bring development. 
If difficulty is found in making out lists, it is easy 
to get them from librarians, English departments in 
higher institutions, or from editors of the better maga- 
zines. A letter stating who you are, what your educa- 
tion has been, and your desire for reading of the 
developmental type will usually be sufficient to get 
several instructive and inspirational lists. 
3. Reading for Recreation. — In addition to develop- 
mental reading the teacher should do some reading of a 
more recreational type. Stories by Octavus Roy Cohen, 
Irvin Cobb, George Patullo, and like authors serve 
this purpose admirably. Light reading should be 
truly recreational and one should avoid the emotional
-P-A-G-E-41

and “tragic” unrealities running throughout most of 
our popular fiction. 
GrowTH FROM CoNTACT WITH OTHERS 
The Teacher’s Relation to His Superiors in Office. — 
The attitude of the successful teacher towards his 
superintendent, principal, or supervisor plays an im- 
portant part in his development. It is always one 
of codperation to the fullest extent. One who desires 
to grow cannot afford to miss the suggestions and 
criticisms of those who are responsible for one’s work. 
The unsuccessful teacher is likely to be opposed to 
anyone who tries to help him. When a mediocre high- 
school teacher was asked what he thought of his prin- 
cipal, he remarked, ‘“ The less seen of him the better.” 
This attitude is common among the failures. How- 
ever, it is not the policy of this book to discuss destruc- 
tive elements to any extent. When those in authority 
are having difficulty, we should try to understand 
them rather than blind ourselves to their virtues or 
magnify their faults. Intelligently loyal followers are 
very essential to the success of any organization. No 
leader can succeed without them. 
A word to the principal or supervisor who wishes 
to help his teachers should be added here. It is the 
custom of successful school officers to work from the 
positive and constructive side. They do not focus 
upon the faults of their teachers. They bring about 
improvement by picking out strong points and enlarg-
-P-A-G-E-42
    22 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
ing upon them until the teacher begins to emphasize 
this side of his work. Eventually so much time is 
taken up in working out these good elements that no 
time is left for disadvantageous work. It is auto- 
matically eliminated. 
However, the facts show that there is much more 
need for warning to teachers than to superintendents 
and principals on this score. The majority of school 
officers seem willing to work for progress. They are 
better informed as a whole than are the teachers. 
Therefore, the teacher who would grow is not likely 
to be disappointed if he takes the time to understand 
the ideals of his principal and superintendent. Nu- 
merous successful teachers report that they owe much 
of their progress to the guidance of some person in 
authority over them. 
The Teacher’s Relation to His Fellow Teachers. — 
In his associations with his fellow teachers we again 
find the successful teacher working to codperate. 
Numerous instances could be reported where teachers, 
when asked to explain where they learned to apply 
some especially good method, stated that it had come 
from a fellow teacher. One particular case of a young 
high-school teacher who showed that she had reached 
a high state of perfection in applying the problem 
method stands out prominently; when asked where 
and how she had learned her method she remarked, 
“Oh! I learned all I know about this from Miss X, who 
teaches in the room next to mine. We have been
-P-A-G-E-43
HOW TEACHERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED 23 
working on the problem for two years. My asso- 
ciations with her have made my teaching a real 
pleasure.” 
It is needless to mention the fact that the teacher 
who is a failure usually shows the most utter disrespect 
for the work of his colleagues. In a school where 
failure was conspicuous a growing teacher who had 
worked there was asked to mention one characteristic 
most noticeable about the teachers. Without hesita- 
tion he remarked that it was lack of codperation. 
Facts oN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERIOR 
TEACHERS 
In conclusion the following data, gathered in a study 
of the lives of 100 superior teachers, point to the

Summary IN SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE 
1. Keep in mind that good teaching is largely a 
matter of development. He who fails to grow, who 
thinks that he is a “ natural teacher,” “ has a knack ” 
for the work, or is satisfied that common sense, in- 
tuition, and a knowledge of subject matter are all that 
is essential, is doomed to failure. 
2. Remember that it is possible to grow as long as 
you teach. Great progress may be made in one year, 
so much even that this amount of experience may 
lift a teacher above average performance, but the 
greatest success comes after years of effort. This’ 
fact makes teaching much more interesting than it 
would otherwise be and indicates that teaching has a 
real future for all those who teach with the intention 
of making progress. 
8. Do not be afraid to change. Be willing to give 
new ideas a sympathetic hearing. Do not let trouble 
frighten you away when you are sure that you are 
working in the interests of the children and for the 
betterment of education. Remember that the facts 
 
-P-A-G-E-45
HOW TEACHERS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED 25 
show a very small percentage of failure on account ‘of 
too much zeal in applying modern ideas, and that 
these failures did not come from the zeal or the ideas. 
4. Never forget to draw upon the three great sources of 
development: further education from going to school 
and from reading; . self-improvement by constantly 
working to overcome your own defects; and the gain 
that comes from proper coéperation with your superin- 
tendents, principals, and fellow teachers.

CHAPTER II 
DEVELOPING A POINT OF VIEW 
EpucATIONAL VALUES 
The Child, the Curriculum, and the Teacher. — 
A broad education and wide experience in the world 
of affairs are first essentials in the development of a 
proper point of view on the part of a teacher. When 
the extent of the good or harm done to the next genera- 
tion by the attitudes of teachers is considered, the 
necessity for these two essentials cannot be questioned. 
The school curriculum is only one of many issues in the 
education of children. At every step in teaching a 
specific subject it is essential to have in mind its re- 
lation to other subjects. A broad-minded, far-sighted 
point of view, therefore, is one of the most desirable 
qualifications of a teacher. 
In developing a point of view the teacher is first 
of all advised to secure as good an education as possible, 
to read widely, and to make many contacts with life 
outside the school or teaching profession. In addition 
a great deal of time should be devoted to thought and 
study on the functions of education. The mind of 
the growing teacher may with profit be occupied by 
27
-P-A-G-E-50
    28 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
the following questions: “ What is it all about?” 
“Why should we do as we are doing in educa- 
tion?” “ What are the comparative values of differ- 
ent possible ways of spending a school hour, day, or 
year?” 
The children should receive first place in the thoughts 
of the teacher. Their welfare is the basic issue in all 
school work. In the teaching of any subject the re- 
sults must be measured in the light of the “ total ef- 
fect” upon the different members of the class. Not 
only the amount of the subject that the children have 
learned is important, but also the habits formed, the 
attitude toward the subject, the interest in work, the 
outlook of each child, and numerous other results. The 
_\-teacher must look upon teaching as a process involving 
first the children; second, the curriculum in general; 
and third, the immediate contact with the children in 
teaching some specific phase of the curriculum. Su- 
perior teachers were observed to be especially strong 
in viewing their daily problems of teaching in the light 
of the larger issues involved. An ordinary act, an 
apparently incidental emphasis, an attitude, casual 
advice to a child, the selection of the next day’s lesson, 
and, in truth, hundreds of seemingly insignificant 
activities were in reality important elements of a whole. 
In superior teaching selection and emphasis were in 
evidence at every step. 
Viewing the Curriculum as a Whole. —It is nec- 
essary, first of all, for the teacher to develop a con-
-P-A-G-E-51
  
DEVELOPING A POINT OF VIEW 29 
ception of the entire curriculum. The relation of each 
part to every other part and the amount of time that is 
to be devoted to different types of work should be 
understood. Even though the plan be more or less 
imperfect, — and no one has as yet been able to plan 
a perfect curriculum, — growth in this direction usu- 
ally results when an honest effort is made to under- 
stand the entire educational process. The fine codpera- 
tion of teachers who try to keep in mind these larger 
issues is always appreciated by progressive principals 
and superintendents. 
Tue Four Basic Lire VALUES 
In order of their importance the four basic elements 
of complete education are the health, the social-civic, 
the vocational-economic, and the culture-recreational. 
These are not new to the student of education, but they 
will be discussed here from the standpoint of the 
development of their use in the practice of successful 
teachers. Too often the teacher complains that this 
is a matter out of his reach. He contends that he 
must follow his course of study. But in the work of 
superior teachers the realization of these values is a 
matter of daily practice, while failure to realize them 
is frequently due to lack of comprehension by the 
teacher rather than an antiquated course of study. 
Recognizing the Health Value.—JIn this connec- 
tion the following practices have been observed in 
modern schools: 
 
-P-A-G-E-52
  30° THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
1. Emphasizing the Necessity of Outdoor Activities 
at Recess. — It should be understood by every teacher 
that the recess is a most important part of school 
work. It is provided in order to secure relaxation of 
overwrought nerves, free flow of blood and lymph 
which have become stagnated by hours of sitting, the 
filling of all the cells of the body with oxygen the 
supply of which is always low after an hour or two of 
inside intellectual work, the stretching of growing 
muscles and tissues, the prevention of deformities 
which constant inside work would be likely to develop, 
and a large number of factors aside from health. The 
teacher who has thought of these values, who keeps 
them in mind in daily practice, is sure to have a whole- 
some influence. However, numerous visits to schools 
in several states have given convincing evidence that 
many teachers force slow children to finish work at re- 
cess, require nervous children to sit inside for punish- 
ment, prohibit “ bad” children from leaving the room 
at recess, and often omit the recess period in order to 
dismiss early. All that is necessary to prevent intel- 
ligent teachers from making such a mistake is that 
they form the habit of thinking of the values outlined 
above. 
2. All. Rules and Regulations Should Foster Health. 
— Teachers who have considered the health value 
and the necessity for stressing health results make 
all school regulations accord with the health of growing 
children. A type of “order” is soon developed in
-P-A-G-E-53
  
DEVELOPING A POINT OF VIEW 31 
each new class which allows a great deal of freedom. 
Children may leave the room at will, talk to each other 
when necessary, and, in fact, act in a normal way 
which prevents unhygienic nervous strain. They 
also learn that it is much more enjoyable to be trusted 
than it is to transgress. On the other hand when the 
teacher’s zeal for school work, punctuality, and the like, 
causes children to form the habit of eating hurriedly, 
to lose sleep, or to retain poisons which should have 
been eliminated from the system, he is failing in the 
one big essential element of education, in the place 
where he must secure results if any of the rest of his 
work is to be of any value. In every assignment, in 
all suggestions, in all requirements, discipline, and 
methods of teaching the health factor is always pres- 
ent. A teacher who works for better health cond:- 
tions may accomplish a great deal. Under the most 
hygienic conditions and with the best of equipment 
it is possible for a teacher to injure both physical and 
mental health. It would be impossible for the teacher 
to make himself too well informed upon the health 
question. Only the most exceptional teacher fully 
realizes the health value in all of the everyday school 
activities. 
Vocational-Economic Results from Everyday Work. 
—It is essential that the American school emphasize 
the earning and conserving elements of daily life in 
all its work. The teacher should be willing to con- 
verse with boys and girls upon possible future voca-
-P-A-G-E-54
  32 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
tions. He must inform himself upon the vocations 
so that he can furnish proper advice. It is a fact that 
children constantly turn to their teachers for guidance 
of this sort. Thus in geography, history, hygiene, 
arithmetic, English, science, or the subjects more nearly 
vocational such as mechanics, commercial branches, 
and home economics, the vocational-economic ele- 
ment is constantly coming up. Brewer! has devoted 
a book to the discussion of how the teacher may help 
children in intelligently choosing vocations by dealing 
properly with this factor of education as it appears in 
the different subjects. 
In conservation and saving, the daily lessons of the 
public school may prove productive of valuable re- 
sults. America is now regarded as the land where 
waste reigns supreme. Education as to the needs 
for conservation is the only plan we at present know 
of to overcome the destruction of our forests, fisheries, 
farms, reckless waste of human energy and lives, and 
extravagance in the thousands of small items of daily 
life. Education must save us from wasting our heri- 
tage. 
It would be well for the school to study the trend 
of modern English fiction. Writers like Wells, Shaw, 
Galsworthy, and Kipling are changing the English 
ideal from one of indifference and idleness to one of 
conservation and work. In the same way the con- 
1 John M. Brewer — Vocational-Guidance Movement. The Macmillan 
Company, 1918.
-P-A-G-E-55
  DEVELOPING A POINT OF VIEW 33 
versations with a superior teacher are bound to have 
their effect upon the future activities of children. 
The new ideal must be to educate for a life of activity, 
work, and conservation. We must train our children 
, to enjoy true happiness by doing good work and by the 
* prevention of needless destruction. By recognizing 
as a constant one in school work, the economic ele- 
ment, the productive-conservative factor that is a 
part of all activity, the teacher does his part in helping 
to realize this aim in education. Arithmetic has 
long been taught from this standpoint. History is 
fast being focused upon true values of human progress, 
of which conservation is one, rather than upon wars 
and political intrigue. Geography is being made far 
more worth while by emphasis upon productive and 
conservational factors in the lives of peoples now living, 
rather than memorizing useless facts about them. The 
conservation of our national reserves can be made to 
play a large part in this subject. 
Emphasizing Social-Civic Results. — The wstais 
school teacher’s work is supported by public taxation. 
The state and the community pay for education be- 
cause it is supposed to develop better citizens. There 
is an extensive literature upon this subject. For a 
background the average teacher would probably de- 
rive most good from reading in. Cubberley’s Hduca- 
tion in the United States about the different battles 
fought in the cause of public education.!

-P-A-G-E-56
  34 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
All the school subjects contain social-civic values. 
English, history, and geography should be taught 
largely from this point of view. The superior teacher 
emphasizes the significance of historical events to the 
community, state, and nation as they exist now. In 
geography facts may be related to the social problems 
of the child’s daily life. English and literature have so- 
cial values and compositions may deal with problems 
of this nature. Arithmetic, botany, biology, general 
science, home economics, and the modern languages 
all contain elements that are social-civic. No one 
of these subjects is taught as it should be unless these 
values are realized. Consider the following illustra- 
tion in botany : 
In connection with the regular work in botany of Lincoln 
High School (Seattle) with the support and codperation of 
students and faculty as an issue in the study of the plants of 
the home region, a definite effort was made to produce a 
large surplus of vegetable and flower seedlings for free dis- 
tribution throughout the school system. The purpose was 
to stimulate garden work and production and to develop 
coéperation. 
In the spring of 1917, over 75,000 seedlings of Early Jersey 
Wakefield cabbages, Danish Ball Head cabbage, Brussels 
sprouts, Curly kale, endive, Black Seeded Simpson lettuce, 
Grand Rapids lettuce. Hanson lettuce, Swiss chard, White 
Piume celery, and Earlana tomatoes were distributed. In 
the spring of 1918, 85,000 of this same list of plants were de- 
veloped, this figure including 10,000 flower seedlings of forty 
different varieties. 
These plants were distributed among the city schools,

  DEVELOPING A POINT OF VIEW 35 
The cafeterias and the domestic science departments were 
provided with thousands of lettuce plants, endive, turnip 
greens, spinach, and radishes. 
The classes, with the help of the school, gathered a large 
quantity of foxglove leaves. These were cured by the classes 
and sent to the Pharmacy department of the University of 
Washington to be made into the drug digitalis. 
The classes have made some effort to provide the office 
and school at large with ornamental flowering plants. Hun- 
dreds of bulbous flowering plants, geraniums, coleus, and cin- 
eraria have been sent to rooms, to class teachers, and to the 
homes of students, and when possible, a blossoming plant has 
been kept on the desk of each student in the botany classes. 
Asa result dozens of students have been influenced to de- 
velop plantsfor thehome. In appreciation some high school 
student penned this poem. 
Ture Narcissus 
(In honor of the gifts of the botany classes) 
Some day this fragrant flower 
May turn our thoughts away,: 
And for a fleeting hour 
Rest our hearts on our way. 
A memory softly stealing 
From days of long ago. 
These kind thoughts each are feeling 
The others seldom know. 
Such thoughts were sent from heaven 
To guide a weary world, 
And some kind thought is given 
In each white bud uncurled. 
Emphasizing Culture-Recreational Elements. — One 
of the chief claims for education in the past has been
-P-A-G-E-58
    36 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
that it adds “ culture ”’ to those who undergo it. The 
term has been so loosely used that it has little specific 
meaning. In considering culture the teacher must 
keep in mind its modern significance freed from the 
traditional load it has carried up to this time. Thorn- 
dike has helped the situation by defining culture in a 
way that makes it tangible as well as useful in everyday 
life. His statement may be modified to read as fol- 
lows: Culture is the ability to enjoy and appreciate the 
world in which we live — including books, people, sports, 
science, and everything of interest or value to the race — 
without taking away from the enjoyment of others. Cul- 
ture is thus truly recreational; but when the two ideas 
are combined we have a condition that gives wide 
opportunity for education. By adding recreation to 
culture it is made practical, while at the same time 
recreation is elevated. 
In their daily work teachers find hundreds of op- 
portunities to emphasize culture-recreational elements. 
When a child does not appreciate something that true 
knowledge would lead him to enjoy, the opportunity 
is afforded to start a train of thought in his mind that 
may lead to a better understanding of values. When, 
through contact with teachers who teach in such a 
manner, the child’s ideas have been enriched and broad- 
ened, his ability to appreciate and enjoy life is increased 
proportionately. 
In teaching literature, for example, the successful 
teacher so presents facts, fiction, and poetry as to
-P-A-G-E-59
DEVELOPING A POINT OF VIEW 37 
lead the children to want more. An important test 
of the work in literature is the amount and type of 
reading done by a class after the course is completed. 
The desire.for a better type of book is worth more than 
all the required reading possible in one term, for the 
development of independent reading of good literature 
brings about results that go through life. The enjoy- 
ment and appreciation of life of such a reader increase 
with the years. 
Every subject has its culture-recreational side. 
Arithmetic should be so taught that children will ap- 
preciate and enjoy it. They should be brought to the 
place, if possible, where they will not feel satisfied 
until they have made their own calculations in every 
transaction in which their rights are involved, such 
as making change, bills rendered, accounts, payment 
for services, and the like. Too often we find an apathy 
towards calculation in matters where it is very nec- 
essary. People who dislike mathematics — often be- 
cause their school experiences have been unfortunate 
and not because they are deficient in the subject — 
allow the banks to take all the responsibility of keeping 
their accounts straight; the groceryman is trusted im- 
plicitly to keep their monthly accounts; laborers who 
work for them are allowed to do all the calculating ; 
and they frequently pocket their change without 
counting it because they so dislike anything “ mathe- 
matical.”” Here is a place where culture and utility 
become one. When a man has learned to dislike
-P-A-G-E-60
  38 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
mathematics to the extent that he joins the large 
group described above, his lack of appreciation and 
enjoyment interferes with his ability to get on in the 
world. 
Another illustration from the botany class already men- 
tioned in this chapter may help to indicate how the culture- 
recreational element is stressed in modern science teaching. 
In the work at school flower baskets were planned. In these 
baskets the following features were studied: arrangement of 
moss and roots so that the plants would live while watering 
could be put off for a maximum time, a desirable combina- 
tion of plants for a basket from the standpoint of beauty, 
ability to thrive under the same conditions, and approximately 
the same length of life, same time for blossoming, etc. 
After making a careful study of plants, their roots, blos- 
soms, habitats, etc., and after successfully assembling groups 
into baskets, different members of the class were given baskets to 
take home and care for. This final stroke added full participa- 
tion and gave true culture-recreational training. At different 
times during the rest of the course the development of plants 
in the different baskets was referred to. 
The Four Factors Often Overlap.— As may be 
seen from the foregoing discussion, the four elemental 
educational values frequently overlap. Some writers 
combine them all into what they term social, meaning of 
use to society or of human value. From Spencer to Bob- 
bit? and Bonser? there has been little or no addition 
to the fundamental concepts. We have gained a great 
deal, however, in our understanding of the values laid 
1 The Curriculum, Houghton Mifflin, 1919. 
2 The Elementary School Curriculum, Macmillan, 1920.
-P-A-G-E-61
DEVELOPING A POINT OF VIEW 39 
down by Spencer, in the widespread use of these values, 
and in scientific demonstration of just what may be 
selected as valuable elements of the different subjects. 
Method Important in Emphasizing Values. — It 
should not be forgotten that the method of teaching 
is a factor here. Botany is not always as valuable 
as it appeared to be in the course taken for illustration. 
A subject may have all the values and still be worth- 
less because the teacher does not know how to bring 
the valuable parts to the front. Any teacher can 
well afford to spend a great deal of time studying ways 
and means of properly emphasizing the values he is 
sure his subject contains. It is one thing to know 
these values and still another to cause them to be real- 
ized in the lives of the children. 
An IpEAL CURRICULUM IN THE BACKGROUND 
Some teachers begin with the curriculum in general 
and develop a scheme of values. The results are good 
because the teacher’s reactions are well thought out. 
He has an attitude toward every subject and a clear idea 
of the results that should be realized. Well-educated 
teachers are in demand today because an appreciative 
understanding of all the subjects is essential to proper 
selection and emphasis in any one. 
The teacher of French, for example, should know 
enough about botany to appreciate modern instruc- 
tion like that described for illustration in this chapter. 
Further, the French teacher must know enough to
-P-A-G-E-62
  40 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
advise most children not to take French. He must 
realize that there is a limited use for his subject, and 
that those who will use it get along far better in a small 
class than in a large class. A successful teacher is not 
measured by the enthusiasm he shows in advertising 
his subject. He desires in his classes only those who 
need his work. 
A Provisional Ideal Scheme. — To help the teacher, 
principal, or superintendent comprehend the signifi- 
cance of a full scheme of education based upon true 
values the following outline is given. This scheme 
has been ‘submitted to teachers, superintendents, 
and principals on numerous occasions. It was built 
up by superintendents and principals who attended 
university classes in the “ Improvement of Teaching ” 
during the four years that this course has been offered 
at the University of Washington. A large number 
of superintendents report that they have used it in a 
more or less modified form. The scheme is submitted 
as something definite and tangible, practical enough 
to be of assistance in curriculum making, ideal enough 
to look forward to for some time, and well rounded 
enough to be stimulating.

DEVELOPING A POINT OF VIEW 47 
Another exercise that is likely to stimulate thought 
is to compare curricula in the local schools with stand- 
ard practices in other schools. Dr. Fred C. Ayer in a 
partial survey of the Seattle schools compiled the 
foregoing table. It would be wrong to assume that 
Seattle should modify its program in order to make it 
like the average in other cities, but the differences 
are well worth knowing and considering. School officers 
and teachers who are acquainted with data like those 
set forth in this table are likely to have a broader point 
of view than they could have without such compara- 
tive data. A study of some of the better school sur- 
veys is likely to help materially in the development 
of a point of view. 
SuMMARY IN SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE 
1. Doeverything youcan to broaden your point of view. 
Schooling, study, reading, and experience in the world of 
affairs are all valuable in the making of better teachers. 
2. Read and study the values of education until you 
have developed at least a partial view of the entire 
educational process. Be able to sense the curriculum 
as a whole back of every subject you teach. 
3. Plan your work with the idea of realizing the 
four basic values of education. At every step foster 
health, emphasize vocational-economic values, stress 
social-civic elements, and make every subject truly 
culture-recreational. 
 
-P-A-G-E-70
  48 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
4. Keep in mind the fact that the hundreds of small 
acts that make up the work of a teacher during a school 
day may express all the educational values and be 
controlled by the larger point of view; that the attitude 
of the teacher is even more powerful than the course of 
study or the textbook. 
Questions To Empxasize Curer Points in Cuaprer II 
1. What two factors are fundamental to the proper point of 
view on the part of the teacher? 
2. What questions should the teacher keep before him? 
3. In what ways do the apparently insignificant actions of a 
teacher reveal his point of view? 
4. What are the four basic educational values that should under- 
lie all teaching? 
5. State five ways in which a recess is valuable from the health 
standpoint. 
6. How may rules and regulations foster or interfere with health? 
7. Describe the teaching of botany from the social-civic stand- 
point. 
8. Define “culture.” 
9. In what way are the methods of the teacher important in 
realizing the large educational values? 
Prosiems For Discussion Sucerstep By Caaprer IT 
1. Describe a teacher who has taught you whom you remember 
on account of his far-sighted attitude. 
2. Describe one who overemphasized unimportant factors and 
neglected larger issues. 
8. Why may it be said that health should be given more attention 
in daily school activities? 
4. Why is it better to have some relaxation at recess on a rainy 
day rather than do without the recess and dismiss early?
-P-A-G-E-71
DEVELOPING A POINT OF VIEW 49 
5. In California the school law requires that no child be kept in 
school at noon, that any child kept in at recess must be excused 
immediately afterwards and that no child be kept in school over six 
hours a day. California legislation has been directed by a strong 
state superintendent and well-trained commissioners. Why did 
they think it necessary to secure such legislation? 
6. Consider the four basic values outlined in this chapter. Can 
you think of a value not included? Is each of the four of basic 
importance? 
7. Describe the teaching of another subject in a way to em- 
phasize cultural values to the same extent that they were emphasized 
in the botany class where flower baskets were made a central 
problem. 
8. Make a complete ideal curriculum for the eight grades, modi- 
fying the one given for illustration in this chapter in any way that 
you think best. Defend your modifications.

  CHAPTER III 
THE INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 
EpucaTioNaL PsycHoLocy In ScHoon PRAcTIcE 
How Superior Teachers View the Subject. — One 
of the gratifying results of this study was the discovery 
that educational psychology is influencing the work 
of superior teachers to a greater extent than the most 
ardent enthusiasts for the subject could hope for when 
we realize that it is still in the first stages of devel- 
opment and organization. Practically every teacher 
in the superior group made constant use of a back- 
ground of educational psychology. This background, 
while not in evidence in furnishing finished devices for 
classroom practice, seemed to play a part in every phase 
of teaching. The far-sighted knowing attitude of the 
superior teacher was based upon a study of original 
nature, a consciousness of the problems involved in the 
learning process, the realization of how children may 
differ, and a knowledge of the different ways in which 
they may be alike. It seems that the superior group 
began their study of educational psychology in school 
and continued to read it and apply it while teaching. 
This resulted in the gradual development of the valu-

able background that made the difference between 
superior and average teaching apparent even in the 
most ordinary circumstances. It might be well to 
mention here that in contrast to this attitude of the 
superior teacher those who were not succeeding re- 
ported that they saw little or no value in this subject. 
It will be possible to discuss only one phase of educa- 
tional psychology here. The specific applications of 
some of the principles of learning will be considered 
as illustrative of the use of the entire subject in the 
improvement of teaching. The teacher who would 
grow is advised to prepare himself in this field, to 
keep its problems before him. Eventually they will 
help him to become an educational thinker, as well 
as make for a wholesome influence in all his teaching. 
Tue ELEMENTS ofr LEARNING 
Thorndike’s Laws of Learning. — Although many 
teachers understand to a certain extent Thorndike’s 
three laws of learning, only the most successful fully 
realize them in practice. It is one thing to know a 
rule or a law, but to put it into practice is another. 
The ability to see a situation in the light of a scientific 
truth is very rare. There are grades of ability in this 
matter. One teacher may apply the laws of learning 
to several situations and fail entirely to see their con- 
nection in similar cases. 
In practice, the three fundamental laws of learning 
should always be combined. It is just here that the 
 
-P-A-G-E-76
  52 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
superior teacher excels. Stated for application in the 
schoolroom, the three laws combine as follows: When 
the nervous system is ready to act, use and pleasure 
are more possible as well as most effective; use in- 
creases ability and disuse decreases ability; but satis- 
faction must be added to use to make it effective, while 
the addition of annoyance makes use ineffective and 
often destructive. We here have the three laws of readi- 
ness, exercise, and effect. In successful learning this 
combination is essential. Errors frequently come 
from applying the laws separately. 
Illustrations of the Application of the Laws of Learn- 
ing. — The best method of discussing the application 
of these laws in their combined form is through illus- 
trations from successful practice. 
Reading. —In a sixth grade a book club was formed. The 
children discussed the values of books and were stimulated 
to read them independently in order to improve themselves 
as well as bring valuable information to the club meetings. 
This club stimulated the application of all the laws, but first 
note the law of readiness. Every child who entered into the 
spirit of the club was ready and anxious to read both the re- 
quired and other books. Observation of the class furnished 
convincing evidence that they were eager to work. 
Now a poor teacher would have allowed such a club to 
drag along for a while, and, on account of his inability to ad- 
just to the nature of child learning, it would have probably dis- 
banded within a few weeks. But the teacher in this case 
knew that his main work was yet to be done. He must see 
that these eager children were supplied with work. He must 
have plenty of books on hand to suggest. He must be ready 
 
-P-A-G-E-77
   INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 53 
with his own careful preparation in order to supply proper 
books to the children. The work of this club for a period of 
months furnished exercise. The teacher saw that the func- 
tions he desired to fix were exercised. And he did his best to 
see that other functions did not receive exercise. 
Lastly pleasure and pain were used to bring about the de- 
sired effects. It was realized that the performances of the 
children would be far below the level of the teacher’s ideal. 
Therefore, when a child made the proper attempt to express 
himself, he was encouraged. The attitude of the teacher, 
the recognition of the class, open statements of praise, private 
conversations with the child in question, and numerous other 
means were used to bring about pleasant associations in the 
child’s mind with the attempt he had made. Each child was 
given a task in which, if he tried, he was likely to succeed to 
the extent that the results would be pleasant. 
In contrast to this illustration of the combined ap- 
plication of the three laws, let us consider some cases 
where failure resulted from partial application. The 
most common case is the neglect of opportunities for 
exercise after readiness has been developed. 
Failure in Student Self-Discipline.— A principal of an 
elementary school in a large city decided to utilize the chil- 
dren in discipline as well as develop a social consciousness in 
his school and derive other benefits that go with such work 
when well conducted. He made a very good plan. The 
children elected officers who were to organize the playground. 
These officers were helped by the teachers, and every one in 
the school was ready to develop a system of children’s organ- 
izations. But the principal after a week or two paid no more 
attention to it. The children soon lost interest. They were
-P-A-G-E-78
54 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
not able of themselves to carry on such a scheme. It “died 
a natural death,” as one boy was heard to remark. 
Now the conspicuous thing here was what followed. The 
discipline of this school became far worse than it was before 
the plan just described was started. The children had been 
made ready to grow and develop through proper exercise. 
Through the inertia of the principal their readiness was not 
taken advantage of. The result was worse than it would 
have been had no such scheme been planned. 
Difficulty in a University Class. — In a summer term a very 
attractive course was announced and described. A large 
class was the result. They came ready and eager to work.. 
But the teacher was not ready for them. He did not have 
his references organized and located. Exercise for the class 
was lacking, but the evil results were not limited to this. 
The students went away from the school very much dis- 
appointed; their ideas were not enlarged or refined; and 
many had the notion that pedagogy isafarce. By getting 
his class ready and then not furnishing the proper exercise, 
this teacher not only injured the students but also the cause 
he was supposed to represent. 
Readiness and Exercise without Satisfaction. — When tests 
are given, there should always be some discussion of the work 
with the children as soon as possible after the test. The 
child should not be allowed to look at his grade and then dis- 
card his paper. The work should be gone over and analyzed 
so that each child may see what part of his work brought the 
satisfaction of a good mark and what part brought the annoy- 
ance of a bad mark. He should also analyze his work so 
that he will know what action to avoid in order to escape pain in 
the future. Such illustrations are common in every school. 
These few illustrations may serve to explain a situa- 
tion which must be met in every case of learning. Suc-
-P-A-G-E-79
  INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 55 
cess is much more likely to crown the teacher’s work 
if he utilizes intelligently the laws of readiness, exercise, 
and effect in their combined form in all his daily work. 
In fact, a helpful discussion of these three laws and their 
implications for practice could well take up the space 
of a book. 
V Tuer ProBLeM or SPEED AND QUALITY 
The Relationship between Speed and Quality. — 
In arithmetic, reading, typewriting, speaking, and 
similar activities, when an ordinary test is given and 
hurry and worry are not suggested, the more rapid 
worker is usually the more accurate. But there are 
many factors in training and learning that combine 
to rob this rule of its simplicity. When the rapid 
worker tries to work more rapidly, he soon reaches a 
place where his speed interferes with his accuracy, and 
in many subjects accuracy may be increased by working 
more slowly. 
Why is it that fast workers as a rule do better work 
than slow workers? The fundamental reason lies 
in the fact that speed and accuracy are attributes of 
vitality and intelligence. An intelligent child who is 
in good health will do a better piece of work in both 
quality and quantity than one who is unintelligent 
or in poor health. Another factor is that of physical 
and_mental codrdination. When the reader retards 
his rate to the extent that all of his mental powers 
are not used in proper proportion, more or less mental
-P-A-G-E-80
  56 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
wandering may take place during the reading. Also 
when one spends too much time on the details of a 
book the important elements are likely to be lost. 
When one hesitates too long in the addition of a col- 
umn, the factors that must be retained for the final 
sum may be forgotten; and in writing one may lose 
style and character by taking the time to “draw” 
each letter. 
On the other hand, too much speed is sure to injure 
accuracy. One could read so rapidly that he would 
get little of the thought. If accuracy were entirely 
ignored, high speed in addition would be possible for 
every one. These facts about too much speed have 
in the past caused an overemphasis upon slow work. 
The old-time teacher did not know, what modern 
scientific investigation has demonstrated, that slow 
work does not insure better quality. There seems to 
be an optimum speed for every worker in every subject. 
This speed is accompanied by optimum quality. Also, 
it has been demonstrated that most persons work at a 
rate slower than their optimum. They thus lose in 
both quality and quantity of output by not undergoing 
the training that would bring them to their best. 
Values of Speed and Quality. — It would not be 
accurate to say that speed is just as important as ac- 
curacy, but it is true that each has a value in every- 
thing we do. The average teacher is sure to note 
that things may be done too rapidly. It.is hard to 
convince him that it is possible to overdo from: the
-P-A-G-E-81
  
INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 57 
standpoint of quality. For example, when writing is 
readily legible, time spent upon improving its quality 
could be devoted to something more profitable. 
The true values of both speed and accuracy (under 
accuracy one might also include quality in penman- 
ship, comprehension in reading, etc.) are based upon 
two factors in every subject. First, the rate _and_the 
accuracy demanded in satisfactory performance. In 
telegraphy, for example, there is what is called the 
“main-line rate”? and accompanying it must be a 
quality legible to main-line operators. In most sub- 
jects this question is not so simple, and it becomes more 
complex when the teacher must apply it to individuals 
who are going into widely different occupations. How 
rapidly and accurately should one be able to add before 
his training may be considered satisfactory? The 
question is a difficult one and at this writing has not 
been answered. The second determining factor is 
human capacity. The law of diminishing returns, so 
characterized by Thorndike, must govern here. When 
the training of the individual has reached the point 
where too much time and energy are required for further 
improvement, continued effort becomes a waste. Thus, 
the objective value of speed or accuracy and the abil- 
ity of the learner to increase either must both be con- 
sidered in judging which type of training will be more 
profitable or whether any training is necessary. 
Training to Improve Speed and Quality. — From 
the standpoint of training, speed and quality are
-P-A-G-E-82
58 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
separate functions. Thorndike’ has noted in a large 
number of the practice experiments that speed was 
increased without any loss in quality. Out of about 
every one hundred scientific experiments published 
during the past ten years, only one or two report gains 
in both speed and quality. All found that practice 
was likely to increase speed, but it was always found 
difficult to improve quality. Judd? found that em- 
phasis upon speed in silent reading often decreased 
comprehension. It was found at the University of 
Washington that either speed or quality could be in- 
creased to the detriment of the other. It was also 
found that it was possible to increase both at the 
same time if proper attention were given to the fac- 
tors involved in each. 
ProsieMs oF INITIAL AND LATER LEARNING 
Some Differences between Initial and Later Learn- 
ing. — When a child or an adult undergoes training 
in order to improve his ability in some function, he is 
certain to go through two distinct stages if the work 
is continued long enough. ‘The first or initial stage 
is rather simple.) Here the task is usually interesting. 
Improvement is likely to go on rapidly, and both 
teacher and learner are.sure to be enthusiastic about

the benefits of practice. Soon, however, interest begins 
to wane, and improvement may slow down, cease, or 
even change to an apparent daily loss in ability. The

Studies of Child Learning Confined to the Initial 
Stage. — Most of the studies of child learning that 
have been reported to date are investigations of learn- 
ing which was of short duration. Some that are quoted 
widely,! as Kirby, Brown, and Phillips, extended at the 
most over a total time of only a few hours. The ex- 
ceptional results exhibited by such writers is one of 
the marks of this initial stage. They did not continue 
their work ‘long enough to strike the bumps and pit- 
falls that were undoubtedly waiting for them further 
on. The teacher who reads the literature which shows 
such remarkable gains from practice (and usually 
practice of the most ordinary sort) often becomes 
discouraged because he does not find in his own classes 
gains that could be compared with those reported in 
experimental work. 
Improvement in later learning is more difficult. 
Interest is harder to generate.) The ordinary person

-P-A-G-E-84
60 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
never goes beyond the initial stage unless he comes 
under the influence of a teacher who understands 
training or is subjected to unusual pressure. The 
superior teacher has developed ways and means of dealing 
with children and subjects in the later stages of learning. 
This is an important factor in his superiority. The 
work of training children in the schoolroom is much 
more difficult than the experimental literature has 
thus far indicated, and successful teachers have tried 
to meet this situation. Thorndike has called atten- 
tion to this difference between work in the school and 
that reported in investigations. 
Training in Initial Learning. — Initial learning oc- 
curs each year at the beginning of school in the fall. 
It also occurs when a new subject is taken up, or when 
a project of interest is started. If we keep in mind 
the two characteristics, high interest and rapid_progress, 
it will be possible so to deal with this stage as to derive 
more lasting benefit from it. Now the problem of 
the teacher is to spread this interest and progress over 
an entire term or year. It is not desirable that at the 
beginning of a play children shall be highly interested 
and then as the real work of development goes on lose 
this interest; that in launching a project great en- 
thusiasm be shown only to diminish; or that in the 
fall when school opens, the work be attacked with 
great zeal while later on the classes must be forced. 
Progress may also be directed in such a way as to 
prevent the sudden break that so often causes dis-
-P-A-G-E-85
INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 61 
couragement. Some special ways of utilizing the 
factors of initial learning are: 
1. Distribute the Difficult Parts of the Work so as 
to Prevent Discowragement. — When at the beginning 
of a subject or at the first of the term high interest is 
evident, the superior teacher selects just enough 
difficult work to prevent too rapid progress. This 
work must, of course, be very worth while and influen- 
tial in development. Thus, when interest is about to 
wane, the difficult task is completed and a sudden 
jump in achievement brings on new pleasure. This 
is really the only true way to attack any problem. As 
early as possible the difficult and uninteresting features 
should be met and mastered. But they should not 
be piled up so high at first as to cause discouragement. 
Just enough hard work should be placed here to utilize 
initial interest and to develop a second period of inter- 
est by the pleasure that is always a part of legitimate 
realization. It is just here that the intelligence, plan- 
ning, and knowledge of the better teacher are revealed. 
2. The Teacher Should Have Work so Planned that 
the Impetus of Initial Energy and Interest Will not Be 
Lost. — Frequently a class loses interest in a subject 
because the teacher was not ready to utilize the fac- 
tors of initial learning. When work worthy of their 
state of mind is not ready for them, children are made 
lazy and disinterested by being forced to dawdle. 
In this case the teacher waits until the best time has 
passed before he is ready with important tasks. When 
 
-P-A-G-E-86
  62 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
they do come, the class has ianhtieiersk, This may 
be the case when the initial work is too easy or when 
it is made up of tasks that do not contain elements 
which make for progress. 
In learning a foreign language, for example, the 
mastery of a number of fundamental phrases is worth 
much more than learning a few declensions. The 
former is much more difficult. But it is also more in- 
teresting and is just the type of subject matter that 
suits the initial stage of learning a language. When 
a basis that appeals to the child’s intelligence has been 
laid, he will be in the stage to take up declensions and 
like factors. He will have reached the place where 
he will probably recognize the need of them. 4 
In the lower grades children are interested in drill 
and mechanics. They come to school to learn. They 
are in the initial stage and desire work of the proper 
sort. Poor teachers fail here by adopting either of 
two equally ruinous policies. One is to regard the 
child as unfit for regular work until he enters the third 
grade, where he encounters a heavy program. For 
two years he has done little more than play. He came 
to school ready to learn. He discovered that in school 
one only plays, and the interests which hearing of 
school had developed soon died. After these two 
years he is told that the time is passing rapidly and he 
must now change his entire method of living. Here the 
entire initial “‘ urge” has been lost. The other method 
is to heap too difficult tasks upon a mind at first will-
-P-A-G-E-87
  INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 63 
ing but soon discouraged and disheartened. The 
learning curve in this case resembles that in puzzles, 
which has already been described. Only here the 
puzzles are made so difficult and uninteresting that 
there is no rise in the curve. Initial energy and in- 
terest are thus dissipated. 
It is very important to utilize properly this initial 
stage in learning. When a new subject is taken up, 
when a new term begins, when a play or a project is 
started, when a child enters a different grade or room, 
when a teacher first takes up his work with a class, and 
when the child enters school, we have situations of 
high potentiality. High expectancy on the part of 
the learner is present. He desires to accomplish 
something worth while. His energy is greater than 
at other times. 
Training in the Later Stages of Learning. — For the 
ordinary individual the later stages of learning are 
characterized by loss of both interest and energy. 
It is here that the superior teacher is at his best. Much 
will have been gained by proper methods at the start, 
but the teacher who must deal with children in these 
later stages has little to do with the work of the earlier 
stages. In the work for the year, he will be able to 
deal with the entire problem, but the common sub- 
jects are begun by the primary teacher and continued 
into the dull drab second stage by teachers in the 
intermediate and upper grades. In the intermediate 
grades the crucial point is reached. Teaching in these
-P-A-G-E-88
    64 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
grades has long been a problem. Our literature on 
pedagogy is almost entirely lacking in devices and 
methods which apply to the third, fourth, fifth, and 
sixth grades. Although later stages of learning are 
met with in the rest of the school, the observations of 
this study force the conclusion that this is the big 
problem for the teacher in the intermediate grades. 
In the high school one teacher or one department 
controls the methods used in teaching an entire sub- 
ject. It is thus possible to provide for both initial 
and later stages of learning. 
1. Diagnosis. — In later learning the teacher must 
take the time to make a thorough diagnosis of the 
condition of each child. All that is good must be 
saved and built upon. Numerous unfortunate and 
disadvantageous habits must be eliminated. In the 
content subjects much that has been learned from the 
wrong point of view will have to be reorganized. 
Even when the initial work has been done by an ex- 
cellent teacher, hundreds of illusions occur, and in the 
later stages these must be weeded out. Following 
are wrong conceptions of children : 
Spelling. — By the time the fourth grade is entered the 
child has attempted to spell most of the words he is likely to 
use in his writing throughout the grades. The study of 
Jones found this to be true.!| Now the poor speller could be 
made at least average by learning from fifty to one hundred 
1W. F. Jones — Concrete Study of Spelling. University of South 
Dakota, 1914.
-P-A-G-E-89
INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 65 
words which he continually misspells. Jones has told us 
what the one hundred demons are, but each child has a few 
special demons of his own. Diagnosis will discover these, 
and when discovered they should be mastered. 
Arithmetic. — Most children suffer from special weak- 
nesses in the four fundamentals, fractions, or decimals. 
Both Woody ! and Counts? have described these in detail. 
Many children in the upper grades do not know the multi- 
plication tables. Some suffer from a lack of knowledge of 
decimals to the extent that they are retarded in their work 
in percentage and interest. One hour of practice on the part 
of such a child after the teacher had discovered his weakness, 
was enough to put him right. It may be that a child missed 
the addition of fractions by being out of school at the time 
this subject was taken up. At any rate teachers who diag- 
nose constantly find the most peculiar weaknesses. One child 
was unable to multiply a fraction by a whole number, although 
he was very good in almost all of the other work in fractions. 
Reading. — In reading, numerous bad habits become es- 
tablished before the child reaches the fourth grade. Special 
difficulties are often avoided by the child. A weakness may 
be established in such a case when only a few minutes’ practice 
is all that is necessary to put him upon a higher level. Judd* 
has made a special study of such peculiarities and methods 
of eliminating them. A child may hesitate in his reading 
because he has formed the habit of going back to words he 
has already read. He may be reading without utilizing the 
factor of context. He may be entirely ignorant of phonics

  66 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
and their use. He may be slow because he has formed the 
habit of being slow. After reading a few passages with more 
speed, he finds that this slowness is unnecessary. Every 
teacher in the elementary school should have Judd’s mono- 
graph. A number of scientific reading studies are published 
by the University of Chicago. 
High-School Subjects. — After the first few weeks of alge- 
bra, French, or history, there are always a few children who 
desire to “drop” the subject. In all probability many others 
are discouraged, but they continue from force of habit. This 
desire to drop may have developed because the teacher did 
not teach properly in the initial stage. In any case, this is 
the time for diagnosis. Instead of being allowed to drop a 
subject, the child who makes such an appeal should be thor- 
oughly diagnosed, told what his weaknesses are, and set to 
work overcoming them. However, not only those that appear 
to be having special difficulty should be diagnosed. The 
entire class should be gone over and set to work anew. 
In high school work this period of discouragement is 
especially noticeable. ‘ Drop-outs” is a term which is find- 
ing large usage. Proper teaching will go a long way in the 
solution of this problem. 
It should be added here that diagnosis is important 
in initial learning when abilities of various kinds are 
essential as a preparation for a subject. Thus, when a 
child enters the algebra class, he should know the 
fundamentals of arithmetic. Diagnosis on this point 
is essential at the beginning. In the study of modern 
languages, however, a knowledge of English grammar 
may not be fundamental. Poor language teachers 
continually complain because their children do not 
know the rules of English grammar. Many superior
-P-A-G-E-91
INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 67 
language teachers do not complain on this score. 
They report that the grammar of the foreign language 
is a secondary matter, more or less important, to be 
sure, but they do not base their language teaching 
upon a knowledge of English grammar. 
Diagnosis of Boy Entering Fifth Grade. — This illustration 
of a fairly complete diagnosis of a fifth-grade boy may serve 
as a model of what the teacher should know about every child. 
Such information is not hard to obtain. It should be done 
during regular school time, as a part of the teacher’s daily 
routine. After it has been worked out, training will be less 
difficult for the entire term. 
1. Personal Factors.— Height, one inch below average as 
given in U. S. government chart. Weight, three pounds be- 
low average for his height. More or less nervous while in 
school. Tends to be a little overactive on the playground. 
Has some trouble adjusting with companions. Intentions 
are good usually. 
These personal factors indicate that this child should not 
be pushed or scolded very much. He should be taught to 
work hard at the beginning of a task so as not to become nerv- 
ous. His height and weight indicate that he should be out 
of doors as much as possible, and he should be allowed a 
great many chances to adjust to social conditions so as to 
develop this side of his nature. 
2. Reading. — Is nervous when reading. Often fails on 
words that are very easy because he does not take chances 
when he feels he is right. This is probably because teachers 
or parents have been too strict: Is slower than the average 
child in the grade. However, contrary to the general rule, 
he remembers exceptionally well. He rarely reads for pleas- 
ure, This may be a cause of his slowness. 
 
-P-A-G-E-92
  68 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
In reading, a plan is formulated in codperation with the 
parents to get him to read twenty minutes a day at home. 
He is to be given a chance in the language period to tell what 
he has read. In school the teacher works to eliminate the 
lack of confidence which exists and which former teaching may 
have engendered. Since his memory for what he reads is 
even better than that of many adults, he is drilled upon 
speed with little or no attention to comprehension. 
3. Spelling. —Is superior in spelling, especially in oral 
spelling. In connected written work, makes many mistakes 
that do not occur at other times. 
He is drilled especially upon correct spelling in composi- 
tion work. 
4. Writing. — This is good, but child works to a disad- 
vantage. He is very inefficient in holding paper and pen 
properly. He takes a great deal of time to get ready. Is 
likely to get ink on his hands and clothes. 
All the trouble in this case seems to come from not getting 
down to business right at the start. He is worked upon from 
this standpoint. He is told to think just what he is to do 
before he does it and to keep in mind such facts as that ink 
will soil, and to use care before he touches the ink. Some 
of this trouble is, no doubt, due to nervousness. Therefore, 
he is not scolded for getting ink on himself. The teacher 
plans to help him gain better control. 
5. Arithmetic. — Is good in mental drills; is fairly accu- 
rate. Takes more time than the average child. This is 
especially true in written work. Is given speed drills in 
written work, emphasizing proper handling of materials. 
6. Interest and Spontaneity. — Is apparently interested 
in everything except the regular work. Assigned tasks seem 
to increase his nervousness. In general information is far 
superior to rest of class. But in any ordinary work is likely 
to be caught attending to something else besides the lesson 
 
-P-A-G-E-93
INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 69 
at hand. Does not hide his faults as well as does the normal 
child. Is thus blamed for many things he does not do. 
The teacher in the fourth grade reported his as a case 
\different from the ordinary. She saw great improvement 
during the year. In this case sudden changes are not to be 
expected. A slow development of interest and effort in 
regular work will be expected. The wide information of this 
child together with the indication of earlier oppression un- 
doubtedly account for lack of interest in assigned tasks. If 
he can overcome the mechanics in the lower grades, he is 
likely to do well in the upper grades. 
The average teacher has not time to make a com- 
plete diagnosis of this kind for every child. But as 
soon as possible those who do not fit into the regular 
work should be studied in the above manner. It is 
not necessary to write it all down in such complete 
detail, but the problem is nine tenths solved when 
such a diagnosis is made. It will help the child im- 
measurably. It will save the teacher from making 
hundreds of blunders. It will prevent numerous 
days of worry when the nervousness of such a child 
may cause no end of trouble if it is not understood. 
Hundreds of experiments upon learning have revealed 
that the teacher cannot proceed intelligently until 
such information is in his hands, and one week of 
training built upon the above knowledge will mean 
more in the way of getting results in the work of this 
boy than an entire term of ordinary instruction where 
the chief concern of the teacher is the imparting of 
units of subject matter regardless of everything else.

70 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
2. Regenerating Interest.— Let us repeat that the 
average person remains average because his interests 
change and wane so often that he does not continue in 
one occupation long enough to become superior. Prob- 
ably a large number of average persons could have be- 
come superior if some one had been near who was able 
to give proper advice and lend encouragement at the 
proper time. When interest begins to diminish, the 
teacher should vary the work. This does not mean 
withdrawal, but only a change in attack. The sur- 
roundings may be modified both physically and socially ; 
the point of application may be changed; and even 
a short rest may be profitable. Shakespeare illustrates 
this idea in his tragedies. At the end of a heavy scene 
we find the clowns, and the next scene is not likely 
to be a direct continuance of the one before. But 
the fundamental elements of the tragedy are working 
throughout the whole. 
Another important factor in the recreation of inter- 
est is motive. The learner should be taught to keep 
his eyes upon the goal. At the end of the initial 
stage, children in the upper grades and high school 
may be told, when they begin to waver, that realiza- 
tion is now only a matter of a short period of effort. 
Our records reveal numerous cases of children who 
wished to drop various subjects but who were thank- 
ful later that they were not allowed to do so. They 
were told to keep on, that a thorough trial of the 
subject had not been made, and that in all prob-
-P-A-G-E-95
  INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 71 
ability they were on the verge of a sudden jump in 
ability. 
The entire plan here must be much more intelligent 
than the old scheme, which often demanded that chil- 
dren stick to whatever task the teacher assigned until 
it was completed. As a rule there must be definite 
reasons for the assignments, reasons which the learner 
can comprehend. These must be based upon diagnosis 
as described in the foregoing pages. When it is under- 
stood that valuable subject matter chosen especially 
to fit his needs is being attacked, an intelligent child 
will be likely to persevere. 
Illustrations of Regenerating Interest. — Let us take, for a 
beginning, an illustration from common experience outside 
of school work. A boy and a man were fishing. They had 
been fishing for four hours without getting a “strike.” The 
boy was tired of it. His interest was flagging. He wished 
to quit and go home. Suddenly a tug on his line made him 
aware that fish were really present. His entire demeanor 
changed. For the next ten minutes his interest was intense. 
He did not need to catch a fish in order to regenerate his in- 
terest. All he needed was alittle encouragement. But when 
at the end of ten minutes a fair fish was caught, his interest 
went up to such a point that a full hour without a strike of 
any kind was not enough to overcome it. But when a couple 
of hours later the fish began to bite to the extent that the man 
and the boy each caught half a dozen fish, it was almost im- 
possible to drag the boy away, and the idea of sometime re- 
turning is enough to make the world a better place to live 
in for him. 
Providing for Visible Evidence of Success. —1. In Read-

  72 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
ing. — A boy in the first grade was not doing as well as he 
should. He had recently become inattentive. The teacher 
asked him to read a selection that was not too difficult. He 
did well and the teacher took special pains to call attention 
to how well he could do when he studied. She also men- 
tioned the gain he had made and told him to keep on, as he 
was surely capable. This did not entirely solve the problem, 
but it had a visible influence upon his attitude. 
There are now a number of short books that any ordinary 
child may finish in fifteen or twenty minutes. The idea of 
finishing a book seems to regenerate interest. It is worth 
trying in cases where children seem to be discouraged. 
2. In Arithmetic. — In a class that was approaching the 
second stage, a teacher planned the assignments each day 
so that three of the five daily problems were such that the 
class could readily work them. Two of the three came first, 
then the two difficult problems, and finally the other easy 
one. The scheme was used to make some realization sure 
to every child who worked. It was observed to have a de- 
cidedly beneficial effect. 
In another place where arithmetic tests were used each 
child kept a record of his improvement. The tests were 
given every two months, and the drill sheets were used daily. 
By emphasizing improvement in every case rather than high 
or low scores, encouragement was furnished to a number of 
children who were hopelessly outclassed as far as natural 
ability was concerned. 
3. In Writing. — In many places the Ayres or the Thorn- 
dike writing scale is posted upon the wall. A child may take 
his work to the scale and score it any time he wants to. This 
allows the opportunity to see improvement. It has proved 
to be a satisfactory practice. Any teacher can get one of 
these scales and with the right sort of stimulus the children 
will make large use of them.
-P-A-G-E-97
  
INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 73 
Another method by which poor writers who were dis- 
couraged have been made to take interest anew is the analysis 
of difficulties, following which they work, overcoming them 
one atatime. By emphasizing a single letter which has been 
giving trouble, great improvement in this one letter may be 
seen in a few days. It should not be written by itself, but a 
sentence should be constructed in which this letter appears 
before and after every letter in the alphabet and at the be- 
ginning and at the end of a number of words. The child 
is told to work on this letter and do his ordinary writing in 
the rest of the sentence. He watches his improvement in 
writing this one letter. Interest usually is very great when 
such a scheme is properly applied. 
If the teacher keeps these two stages of learning in 
mind from the beginning, the second stage may never 
appear in the form of a plateau. Thorndike contends 
that in all probability intermediate plateaus are un- 
necessary.| When the work is properly arranged, 
fairly uniform progress, with constant daily fluctua- 
tions, of course, may go on throughout an entire year. 
But the facts of initial and later learning must be kept 
in mind if the difficulties of the average or ordinary 
teacher are to be avoided. 
Proper TRAINING ACCOMPANIED BY TEMPORARY 
RETARDATION 
Immediate Results Often Deceptive. — When a 
child or an adult begins a complex and difficult task 
such as learning to read, typewrite, or play the piano, 
1See plateau in the curve given in this chapter, the “dead level” 
after the first two weeks of improvement.

74 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
or when he takes up algebra, French, or chemistry, 
there are numerous proper adjustments which if not 
made at the beginning grow more difficult to make as 
practice continues. Improper ways of doing hundreds 
of apparently insignificant acts may gradually become 
fixed. They make up a growing body of liabilities and 
prevent the learner from reaching the highest success. 
In music, therefore, the child should have the best 
possible teacher at the beginning. It is better to have 
a good one then and one less skillful later on, than to 
reverse this order. Many parents make the error of 
sending their children to mediocre music teachers 
until “they get far enough along to need a better 
teacher.” The result is the ingraining of bad habits 
at the time when an hour of proper practice is worth 
a hundred hours of practice later on. 
What has been said of music may be said of any 
other complex subject. Judd! has shown that the 
proper basis for successful silent reading in the upper 
grades is laid in the four lower grades. 
It is not difficult to get results at the beginning. The 
fact that an adjustment is being made, even though 
it be a poor one, is enough to insure improvement in 
a function about which the learner knew nothing be- 
fore practice began. This fact has been very deceiv- 
ing to the educational world in general, but the superior 
teacher knows better than to rely upon such gains.

He knows that the disadvantageous method will cause 
so much trouble later that immediate gains may well 
be sacrificed in order to fix at the start proper modes 
of procedure. 
Illustrations. — A young man who had a good voice de- 
veloped considerable ability in singing. He sang at enter- 
tainments and in choirs for several years. Then he decided 
to have his voice trained. He went to a famous teacher and 
began taking lessons. He found that the long time he had 
spent in singing without proper training had developed habits 
that injured the quality of his tones, limited his range, and 
actually tore his throat to pieces every time he sang so that with 
each song his voice became worse. Most of the years of his 
training were spent in overcoming the drawbacks which his 
early unguided experience had fixed upon him. 
Anyone who learns the game of golf will be brought face 
to face with this situation. In fact, this game brings home 
the value of proper training at the start better than anything 
else. A player who pays no attention to his habits is likely 
for the first few weeks to be superior to one who is under the 
guidance of the best of trainers. In fact a novice after a 
week or two of practice may be able to beat players of con- 
siderable experience. But after a few weeks bad habits be- 
gin to overcome early adjustments. The longer such a per- 
son plays the worse he gets. This is common knowledge on 
the golf links. Golf is no different from any complex func- 
tion, but the result of a drive or a putt is always visible. It 
is ideal from the standpoint of allowing the learner the 
opportunity to see the results of early mistakes. 
Changing Bad Habits.— When disadvantageous 
habits are once formed the immediate results in per- 
ip

76 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
formance must be neglected and attention focused 
upon the substitution of the right method of work. 
We find such a situation in silent reading. Many 
children articulate as they read. It has been found 
that articulation decreases speed. When the child 
at first tries to keep from articulating, his attention 
wavers between his method of reading and the material 
that is being read. Poor work is the result. The 
teacher who does not look beyond immediate returns 
is likely to note this and be disheartened by the fact 
that any interference with the child’s natural method 
decreases his ability. The teacher who understands 
the facts of learning and training will keep on until the 
articulation is eliminated without paying much atten- 
tion to immediate results. It has been found that 
when articulation is finally eliminated the speed of 
the reading increases.’ 
Wasted energy in addition furnishes another illus- 
tration. Suppose a column like the following is to be 
added :

rapid than oral reading. With complete articulation it is, of course, 
the same as oral reading. Silent and Oral Reading. Houghton

and 6 are 11 and 1 are 12 and 7 are 19 and 4 are 23,” 
he is allowing himself to go over seventeen different 
words in the addition of the first column. It has 
been found that training to cut down the number of 
words in this process will increase speed. Proper 
training would develop the habit of repeating to him- 
self merely each new sum as “11, 12, 19, 23.” But 
when such training is begun, the results in both speed 
and accuracy suffer. After a time, however, the value 
of the new method begins to tell, and when it is firmly 
established the learner forever afterwards works upon 
a higher level. 
Incorrect PopuLaR IpzAs TO BE OVERCOME BY 
EpucaTionaL PsycHOLOGY 
Practice Does Not Make Perfect. — Thorndike 
in his Psychology of Learning concludes that it has 
been a mistake to assume that constant practice is 
all that is necessary in order to assure improvement. 
Probably the ill effects of the naive application of the old 
proverb, ‘‘ Practice makes perfect,’ have been more 
damaging than a casual glance would indicate. Take 
for illustration some effects in teaching the tool subjects. 
In writing, children have been allowed to practice 
in such a way as to fix bad habits of all sorts. It has 
been found in some schools that the more they practice 
the worse they write. Disadvantageous methods of 
holding the pen, unwholesome positions, bad arrange- 
ment of the paper, and other like factors often furnish  
-P-A-G-E-102
73 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
a background for poor spacing, uneven alignment, and 
unequal height in the same letter. Constant repetition 
(practice) of such a combination of factors may finally 
establish the ‘“ character” of the child’s handwriting.! 
In reading, children often develop the habit of reading 
slowly. They practice this method until a dozen or 
so details become established. The halting reader 
learns to stop too often in looking over a line; he 
goes back to words after once passing them. Often a 
habit of paying practically no attention during the 
first reading is formed. Such a reader must always 
read the most simple directions several times before 
he can focus upon the meaning. How long would 
practice of this kind need to be continued in order to 
reach perfection? 
In arithmetic practice is often of such nature as to 
ingrain inaccuracy. For illustration consider the com- 
mon uses of the answers that are furnished to problems 
in many texts. The child comes to a solution and 
turns to the answer. He takes little trouble to check 
his work. He hurries through to a solution as quickly 
as possible. Usually his first answer is incorrect. 
He goes through the problem again and refers to the 
correct answer a second time. Often this is repeated 
several times. After six or eight years of such training 
one learns to do his work in such a way as to expect his 
answer to be incorrect. The majority of adults who 
1See F. N. Freeman — The Handwriting Movement. Chicago Uni- 
versity Monograph, 1917.
-P-A-G-E-103
    
INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 79 
have studied arithmetic by this traditional method 
state that they never trust their calculations. At 
times when they are forced to add a few long columns, 
perform long division, or multiply fractions they state 
that they would give anything for some kind of answer 
book. If the reader has gone through such training, 
he has probably experienced this feeling himself. 
The modern languages have been so taught in many 
of our high schools that children who have “ taken ” 
French, German, or Spanish for two or three years 
have not been able to speak or read the language. Yet 
a successful language teacher reports that he teaches 
the majority of his students both to read and to speak 
fairly well in one year. What is wrong with practice 
that does not develop this ability? The teacher merely 
“ covers” the grammar, requiring that declensions and 
conjugations be learned; then follows the ‘ required 
books,”’ and these are studied with dictionaries and 
grammars at hand. The children are not required to 
do a definite amount of speaking; they are not asked 
to master in connected sentences the phrases that are 
most commonly used; the parts that are most useful 
and difficult are not tabulated and used in drill; in- 
dependence in the interpretation of a paragraph with- 
out the use of a dictionary is not emphasized; and 
so on—one could continue until numerous essential 
factors of successful practice that are ignored in such 
work had been mentioned. 
Why Practice So Frequently Fails. — There are a
-P-A-G-E-104
  80 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
number of causes for the failure of practice to bring 
about desired results. Some of these are: 
1. Incorrect Practice. — Probably this is the most 
frequent cause of difficulty. When the learner prac- 
tices the performance of an act, he, of course, fixes 
his habitual way of doing it. With every repetition, 
the firmer the habit becomes. Thus, when a child 
has spelled until with two l’s in all his written work 
for a period of five years, his practice has made it more 
difficult to form the habit of spelling the word cor- 
rectly. When he has read without trying to compre- 
hend at the first reading, his ability to learn to compre- 
hend without first reading several times is lowered in 
accordance with the extent of the faulty practice. 
When he has practiced playing the piano undera poor in- 
structor his numerous bad habits limit his development. 
Thus, in the schoolroom a period of twenty minutes 
spent in “writing practice’? may result in lowered 
writing ability if very definite ways of practicing are 
not established. A period spent in reading may assist 
in developing and fixing numerous faults. By work- 
ing a dozen arithmetic problems at home every evening 
for a term a child may fix habits of slow and inaccurate 
work. When work is merely assigned, results are fre- 
quently more destructive than constructive. 
2. Destructive Practice.— This type of practice 
may result from a number of causes. The hygienic 
surroundings may be such that every effort tends to 
destroy rather than develop. In reading, children 
 
-P-A-G-E-105
INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 81 
‘may injure the eyes by facing a bright light. If this 
is continued for a long time permanent injury may 
result. The print or the paper may, likewise, be de- 
structive. A schoolroom in which bad air is a con- 
stant factor may make schooling productive of injury. 
In athletics the results of destructive practice are 
most apparent. When heavy exercise follows a meal, 
its results are not developmental. Also when exercise 
is continued beyond the point where the system can 
react and overcome the destruction of nerve and 
muscle cells, the athlete loses as the days go by. A 
good trainer seeks to ascertain knowledge of the con- 
stitutional vigor of the person to be trained before 
he goes very far in prescribing exercise. He also 
works very gradually from light to heavier tasks, 
until the result is a well-trained and hardened athlete. 
The novice who plans his own exercise may injure 
himself. This has frequently been the result when 
frail persons have taken up such exercise as horseback 
riding. Physical training merely offers an obvious 
illustration ; mental results are just as sure. 
3. Practice by Doing the Same Thing in Too Many 
Different Ways. — Most of the mechanical factors of 
action in modern life are learned best if but one method, 
of course the best one known, is taught. Writing is 
a conspicuous example here. Children are often 
taught three or four different systems during the ele- 
mentary-school period. The result may be seen in the 
writing of the average person. There are numerous
-P-A-G-E-106
  82 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
other places where the same situation is found. In 
addition, subtraction, long division, making change, 
habits of speech, mannerisms that are developed in 
teaching children to be polite, and so on, we have 
trouble because numerous ways of doing a simple, 
habitual act are developed. In every case when the 
time and energy are spent upon any one type of action 
advancement is insured; while so much interference 
is generated when several different ways of performing 
a simple act are taught, that general incapacity and 
bewilderment, rather than progress, often result. 
In consideration of the foregoing, a teacher cannot be 
too careful in arranging the details of school work. Con- 
stant attendance at school does not insure progress and 
even immediate gains may be coupled with elements 
that mean eventual loss. 
Proper, Incorrect, and Destructive Practice Are Often 
Combined. — Here is probably the crux of most diffi- 
culties. When proper practice is arranged, it is often 
difficult to limit the other two factors. We are even 
often able to report appreciable gains from practice of 
the right kind, while, at the same time, the slowly de- 
veloping results of a few incorrect acts as well as the de- 
structive influences of bad surroundings finally serve 
to overcome all the gain and eventually cause our 
efforts to bring about a fall in ability. 
This may be witnessed by anyone who begins a 
new complex activity. Because he was totally in- 
capable at first, the learner seems to progress rapidly.
-P-A-G-E-107
  
INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 83 
But this rapidity is only the result of overcoming a 
few of the gross elements which yield readily to prac- 
tice. At the same time he fixes numerous unfortunate 
habits some of which may be very difficult to elimi- 
nate later on. For example, Thorndike has been able 
to show that good work may be done in an overheated, 
poorly ventilated room. The good work was an im- 
mediate result. If the workers continued for months 
to work under the unfavorable conditions, they would 
finally begin to suffer. 
Incidental Learning Not Counted on by Superior 
Teachers. — Incidental learning is rarely dependable 
learning. The process of learning is too complex to be 
brought about in any haphazard fashion. This is 
especially true of any advancement that the indi- 
vidual makes beyond ordinary achievement. A child 
in learning to read may be bright enough to master 
phonics without taking much time in class for them. 
In this case he undoubtedly learns consciously the 
sounds that go with the different letters. They may 
have come without much apparent effort because 
they were connected with interesting words and sub- 
ject matter. In such a case we are very likely to find 
numerous difficulties which only a few minutes’ well- 
planned drill would have prevented. In mathematics 
and language diagnostic tests are revealing like situa- 
tions. Many children finish school without being 
able to make change accurately. This is a subject 
usually left to incidental learning. A few periods  
-P-A-G-E-108
  84 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
spent in teaching children how to make change in the 
proper way will show that specific training is far supe- 
rior to the incidental method. 
Children will learn many things “‘ incidentally,” but 
learning of this type, by its very nature, is not to be 
depended upon in an organized system of education. On 
the farm we are beginning to find that nothing is likely 
to grow to the fullest possible extent unless some one 
is there to provide the numerous favorable conditions. 
In manufacturing, the minutest detail must be planned, 
else success in some large enterprise may be hindered. 
Therefore, when a motive for work has been es- 
tablished, and when interest is high, the good teacher 
knows that his main work is still before him. He does 
not say, “ Now I have the class interested and am 
sure that learning will go ahead without any more 
planning on my part.” He merely rejoices that in- 
terest is established so that it will be possible to go to 
work in attacking the problems or mechanical difficul- 
ties that lie between the children and success. 
SuMMARY IN SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE 
1. Read and study educational psychology. The 
science of learning must eventually be understood by 
the teacher who continues to advance. 
2. Emphasize in your daily work the factors of learn- 
ing that have been discussed in this chapter. Util- 
ize initial and later learning in your plans. Work for 
a proper balance between speed and accuracy. Re-   
-P-A-G-E-109
INFLUENCE OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY 85 
member that immediate success does not always 
indicate eventual gains, and when you know for what 
you are working, do not let immediate troubles dis- 
courage you. Wrong ways of doing things are hard 
to overcome. But when once they are eliminated 
the individual is left upon a higher plane. Strive 
to learn to apply the three elemental laws of learning, 
readiness, exercise, and effect. 
3. Do not forget that progress is won only after 
long continued effort in doing the right thing in the 
right way at the right time. Determine carefully 
the course to follow and then continue in it year after 
year until results come. Modify it only as you see 
that such modifications will be beneficial. For il- 
lustration, if a new and better system of writing has 
been discovered, do not apply it to children who have 
practically completed their training in writing. Keep 
in mind the time element. Many of our changes have 
merely brought confusion. 
4. Do not place reliance upon the chance that what 
you wish to have learned will be acquired “ incident- 
ally.” Use every incident that may be encountered 
on the way in bringing about the success of your plans. 
Do not let your plans be dominated by these incidents. 
5. Much of the ordinary practice in school work has 
had a negative influence. Constant effort in recita- 
tions and study periods does not insure improvement. 
See that you do everything you can to make your efforts 
bring progress rather than interference.

CHAPTER IV 
THE TEACHER IN THE BACKGROUND 
A Basic PrInciPLE APPLIED 
Educational Psychology in Class Management. — 
This chapter describes the application of a basic prin- 
ciple of educational psychology in the organization and 
management of children in classes. This principle 
may be stated as follows: Jn every act of education the 
learner must undergo the educative experience. To the 
extent that this principle is realized teaching brings 
results. When the learner does not participate, the 
best of plans is sure to fail. Therefore the first issue in 
all teaching is that of bringing the work of the children 
into the foreground, making child activity play the 
larger part with teacher activity directed solely toward 
the stimulation, inspiration, and guiding of the children. 
With this one principle in mind anyone can go into 
an ordinary classroom and see the waste and futility 
of a great deal of teacher activity. 
The teacher must cease taking exercise that he does 
not need and plan to make his classes more active. 
“<The teacher must become less active physically and 
verbally and more scientifically active mentally. 
87
-P-A-G-E-114
  88 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
Teaching thus becomes a matter of thoughtful analysis 
at every step. 
The ability to work independently is developed in 
children as the teacher keeps to the proper extent in 
the background. Child initiative and independence 
will be considered at length in this chapter. 
Results are lasting under this method. They even 
go late into life and grow as the years pass by. Nu- 
merous adults report that they are still deriving bene- 
fits from suggestions received from teachers thirty 
and forty years previously. Such results would have 
been impossible had the teacher done all the acting. 
Consider the following illustration : 
A teacher in a normal school is remembered by at least 
twenty successful men as the one person who stimulated and 
to a large extent guided them in making a success of life. 
These men point to the self-sacrificing personal interest that 
this man took in them as fundamental in his work. They 
also mention the large part played by discussions in class. 
Here the different individuals took issue with the teacher and 
with each other. One young man reports as follows: 
“T remembered the discussions relative to philosophical 
concepts. Here I developed from one stage to the other in 
rapid succession. I expostulated loudly in defense of many 
antiquated ideas. At the same time I read widely. I can 
still see the keen, thoughtful glance of the teacher as he 
listened with inner approval (approval not recognized so 
much by me then as now) to my discourses. As I look back 
I realize that his pleasure was gained from watching the 
struggling student work through the necessary steps for de- 
velopment rather than from the value of what I said.

THE TEACHER IN THE BACKGROUND 89 
“From this man I learned to read and think independently. 
I learned that there were possibilities ahead of me far greater 
than I had thought of before I took work under him. Ialso . 
learned that a superior teacher is pleased when his students 
take issue with him if they have data of their own upon 
which to base their opinions. In learning this I changed from 
a follower to an independent thinker. This change has 
meant much to me. 
“Although, as I now view it, my success is very limited, 
Tam realizing much that he suggested to me and which seemed 
so impossible at the time. I am sure that all of us who were 
members of his classes owe much to his method of keeping 
his own personality in the background while he spent his 
energy in devising ways of developing us.” 
The Modern Teacher Keeps in the Background. — 
\A superior teacher never does all the work while the 
class looks on. He is more interested in the influence 
upon the class of the facts he teaches than he is in the 
subject as such. The teacher who desires to improve 
his work may well begin at this point. Let him learn 
to wait while the children grow through their diffi- 
culties. Let him direct and help only in ways that 
will stimulate the pupil to direct and help his own 
efforts. 
The teacher who helps children over their difficulties 
by explaining constantly is doing the easiest thing. 
He is realizing his own desire for activity; his own 
discomfort in inhibition is avoided when he does not 
wait patiently for the child to learn in his own fashion. 
He is expecting more of an immature child than he is 
 
-P-A-G-E-116

of himself. He expects and requires the child to keep 
quiet, especially the bright child who understands long 
before the teacher finishes with his multiple explana- 
tions, while the teacher has not self-control enough to 
wait for the slow child. 
In our own teacher-training work, with some excel- 
lent teachers to demonstrate, not in special lessons 
but in daily work, hundreds of young teachers and 
prospective teachers have been sent to observe. 
Often their first remarks upon what they have seen are 
relative to the ability of superior teachers to wait while 
the children learn. Children in such classes early 
show capacity for individual and group performance 
far superior to those in ordinary schools. The fact 
that the teachers know how to keep in the background 
and at the same time provide the training and proper 
suggestions necessary to bring about advancement, 
is the fundamental reason for initiative, combined 
with the capacity to succeed, on the part of the children. 
To Be in the Background Is Not to Withdraw En- 
tirely. — Here is one of the most difficult factors in 
all the work of teaching. Every teacher should daily 
ask himself these questions: ‘How may I teach 
and still make it possible for the children to learn? 
How must I act in order to keep the class active and 
still not lose the opportunity to influence the pupils 
properly? How may I stimulate, guide, suggest, at 
times control, and at the same time allow the children 
to act spontaneously, intelligently, and without any
-P-A-G-E-117
THE TEACHER IN THE BACKGROUND 91 
idea that I am forcing this action? How may I keep 
in the background and at the same time be sure that 
I am doing my part?” 
The successful teacher realizes a proper balance in 
these matters by observing the following points: 
1. His work is well planned. He has in mind where 
he is going, why he is going there, and how he intends 
to get there. He also knows what means he has at 
hand, and he has organized them in the most effective 
way possible. 
2. He studies his class. He has studied them as a 
group. He has studied each individual. His work 
is one of stimulating and developing these individuals, 
so that they will become more capable and independent. 
3. He knows that every child must receive all the 
exercise of desirable functions that it is possible for 
him to provide. Thus, instead of making his own 
activity the center of the work, he finds himself busy 
in the task of organizing and planning so that all the 
children will have proper opportunity for activity. 
4. Back of all the activity of the children we find 
the presence of such a teacher “imminent,” as one 
successful superintendent expressed it. He is there 
as a source of information, as an unbiased judge in 
disputes that cannot be settled by the children, as a 
wholesome, uplifting, stimulating force which adds 
to the zeal and happiness of the children and makes 
the work immediately worth while as well as develop- 
mental.

SUGGESTIONS AND ILLUSTRATIONS 
Use Caution in Beginning. — When children have 
not been allowed much freedom, it is a grave mistake 
to give them a great deal of liberty at first. Such a 
course is bound to result in disaster. A capable teacher, 
upon beginning work with a class that has been held 
down by mechanical teachers in the past, first of all 
makes a careful study of the class. Gradually re- 
sponsibility is shifted from the teacher to the children. 
In every class there are always a few children who can 
be counted upon to understand what is desired by the 
teacher who leaves a problem for them to solve with- 
out help. These rise to the occasion and take over 
work that was formerly cared for entirely by the 
teacher. At first their efforts are likely to be crude. 
They will not do as well as the teacher could have done 
for them, but the immediate performance is not the 
result that is being worked for in this case. After a 
few weeks good results are usually in evidence. 
Here is a type of training that may well go on from 
the kindergarten through the graduate college. No 
one ever reaches the place where he has initiative to 
spare. An illustration of its highest development 
was seen in the officers of all the armies during 
the World War. It is impossible to conceive the 
heights to which man may some day ascend when 
initiative and tenacity are developed to their fullest 
extent.
-P-A-G-E-119
  
THE TEACHER IN THE BACKGROUND 93 
When too much responsibility is shifted from the 
teacher to the children, the result is either an orgy of 
license or despair. Such a case is illustrated by the 
man who, upon hearing an eminent man state that he 
allowed his children to help themselves from a common 
purse, went home and tried this method with his spend- 
thrift son. The son, of course, immediately took undue 
advantage of his laxity, whereupon the father con- 
cluded that the idea was not practical. But in one 
case this liberty followed years of training, while in 
the other nothing but parental mistakes preceded 
it. 
Developing Independence and Initiative in a 
School. — A principal with modern ideas took charge 
of a school where a “ military’ principal had been 
employed for the three years immediately preceding. 
The man who was leaving had, literally speaking, “ run 
the school.” He disciplined with an iron hand, pun- 
ished severely whenever the occasion allowed, and 
kept aloof in all group undertakings. In fact, the 
new man found a typical situation where a school has 
been in charge of a person who has not been exposed 
to modern ideals and practices. The children had 
received no training in choosing for themselves. They 
had not been allowed to control their desires, for the 
teachers had seen to that for them. When given free 
rein, they did not know enough to avoid the injurious, 
nor did they know when to stop after starting upon a 
course of action. 
   
-P-A-G-E-120
94 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
This situation is like the one described by Alexander ! 
as typical of the relation between teacher and pupil 
in the German elementary schools. There children 
were required to show the greatest respect for the 
teacher. They courtesied to him whenever they met 
him. They obeyed implicitly and spoke only when 
called upon. On the other hand, Alexander tells us, 
they inwardly disliked and disrespected everything 
connected with this same teacher. This was shown 
by the way they acted when not in his presence or 
when his back was turned. Such a method is the 
ideal education for autocracy. When American schools 
| are managed in this way, true Americanism cannot 
possibly result. 
The new principal found a situation difficult to deal 
with. First of all it was evident that the children 
preferred to be anywhere but in the company of the 
principal. His problem is illustrated by the fact that 
when he walked down the street, groups of boys would 
scatter at his approach. He went to work auietly. 
He delegated responsibility. He took the attitude that 
the school needed the services of every one in the com- 
munity and in a very short time the children had the 
idea that their principal was helping them build up 
their school. 
This man remained in the community only one year, 
but made rapid progress in getting the school upon a   
1 Thomas Alexander — Prussian Elementary Schools. The Macmillan 
Co., 1918. 
 
-P-A-G-E-121
THE TEACHER IN THE BACKGROUND 95 
footing where it could go ahead without his constant 
attention. He did not in this time begin to achieve 
all that he desired. But some of the results may be 
enumerated. 
First, he so inspired his teachers to want to succeed 
and know education in the higher sense that the ma- 
jority of them went as a group to Teachers College, 
Columbia University, the next summer. This is 
merely an indication of a changed attitude which went 
so deep that it changed hundreds of unwholesome fea- 
tures of school life and work that had grown up under 
the earlier principal. It might be well to note that 
these teachers learned not to rely upon the principal 
for everything. The fact that they spontaneously 
organized and decided to spend the summer in de- 
veloping themselves illustrates this point. 
Had the attitude of the principal been less sensible, 
he would have taken pride in an ability to settle nu- 
merous little difficulties for his teachers. He would 
have reveled in the idea that he was the human dynamo 
that functioned as the center of power. But in work- 
ing in the modern way he accomplished so much more 
for his school and his teachers that comparison would 
be futile. The important result of his method was that 
he placed the school and the community upon a higher 
plane, where it has remained for fully five years after he / 
left. i 
Second, there was a distinct change in the attitudes 
of the children toward school and going to school. 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
  96 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
Many of the older boys who had quit school the year 
before, returned. Some of these stayed and finally 
graduated. Under the old principal they had with- 
drawn as soon as the law would allow, and the majority 
of them were loafers, working at odd jobs now and 
then. This group of young men constituted a real 
menace to the community. 
Work of this kind in education might be compared 
to that of the doctor who cures his patients by teach- 
ing them how to live. Hundreds of modern scientific 
investigations have revealed that bright people be- 
come criminal or insane when they are not trained to 
realize legitimately their inner impulses and desires. 
Developing Initiative in Primary Children. — As a 
basis for the discussion of this topic let us consider 
a primary room in a small town where the teacher had 
practically no equipment, not even a musical instru- 
ment. A diagnosis of her work showed that she had 
become the center of activity. When she was given 
the modern idea, she saw immediately what she had 
been doing. Her task now was to place herself in 
the background and still do her part in educating the 
children. It might be well to mention several specific 
points where improvement was revealed in less than 
\a week. 
\ First, instead of ‘‘ mothering” the children in all 
their little activities, she began to allow them to run 
about without attention on her part. When they 
came into the room from recess, she stopped watching 
 
-P-A-G-E-123
      
THE TEACHER IN THE BACKGROUND 97 
over them. At first they acted somewhat like little 
animals; one child seemed to like to stand upon his 
desk; another wanted to go to a far corner of the room ; 
and another wanted to tell the teacher a story. She 
reports that she ‘listened to the story, paid practi- 
cally no attention to the child who stood upon his desk, 
and allowed the one in the far corner to stay there as 
long as he wanted to. 
However, it was not the plan to allow this situation 
to continue or grow worse. She merely avoided calling 
public attention to what these children were doing, 
and at the same time she controlled her own impulses 
long enough to wait until she saw what the children 
would do when left to themselves. During this wait- 
ing she raised the question with herself as to just how 
“bad” these little activities were. In most cases 
she found that merely waiting for the child to adjust 
was more powerful and lasting than anything else she 
could do. In the few cases where waiting did not 
suffice she found that individual observation soon re- 
vealed ways of dealing properly with the child in ques- 
tion. 
Second, she noticed that in their singing and games 
the children sang well only when she sang with them. 
Being without musical instruments she had found it 
necessary to sing for games rather than to play. She 
decided that she would try to train the children to 
sing their songs as they played and danced just as well 
when she did not sing or when she stopped in the middle
-P-A-G-E-124
98 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
of a song as they did with her leading. In one week 
this ability was developed and the teacher reported 
that the difference in their interest in the games and 
the development of a spirit of wanting to attack things 
independently was very noticeable. They also learned 
during this year many more new songs than it had 
been possible to teach to preceding classes. 
For a third factor let us consider the methods of 
meeting the curriculum and the regular work. In 
reading she found that most of the children had formed 
the habit of merely stopping and waiting when a diffi- 
cult word was met. She found herself supplying the 
word for them. She had formed such a strong habit 
of rushing to their assistance that she had great diffi- 
culty in waiting for the child. On the other hand she 
discovered that this method had developed some “ pro- 
fessional waiters ”’ as she expressed it. They “ merely 
camped on the difficult word” until the teacher gave 
them the usual assistance. .By showing the children 
what they should do and by working with them and 
herself for a few months, she brought about great im- 
provement. Many of the children reached the place 
where they felt injured if the teacher helped them over 
a difficult word or phrase. 
In “busy work” (in the modern school called the 
“free period ”’) she had heretofore kept close watch 
to see that all the children kept busy at the kind of 
work she had arranged for them. She now made up 
her mind to allow more freedom and study rather than 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
    THE TEACHER IN THE BACKGROUND 99 
guide and control the children. In this work she felt 
that the greatest gains were made. By keeping her 
own ideas to herself and by observing carefully she 
found that every child in the room had definite inter- 
ests of his own. These she seized upon in her educa- 
tional scheme. Henry was motor and mechanical. 
He loved to cut paper, to work at the blackboard, and 
to build. Without appearing to interfere with his 
freedom she gradually supplied more developmental 
work of these three types. Henry was allowed to take 
his choice, however. But when he did something of 
educational value, the teacher took the pains to speak 
about it. It was not long until the children would 
spontaneously form in groups at the board or about 
a game, and they taught each other. Now and 
again they became noisy. But even in these cases she 
made it a part of her plan to wait and see if they would 
not settle down of their own accord. They finally 
reached the place where they would notice their own 
disturbance. It was not at all infrequent at such 
times to hear a child whisper to his fellows something 
like the following, ‘‘ Here, here, we must be more care- 
ful.” 
It should by all means be added here that this teacher 
found the greatest gains from such work to come to 
herself. She reported that never in all her five years’ 
experience as a primary teacher did she realize how 
attractive and wholesome little children are. Many 
of the actions that she had previously considered
-P-A-G-E-126
“100 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
“bad” or annoying became interesting, and her ob- 
servations furnished keys to knowledge concerning 
the children of great worth to the teacher. 
But her greatest gain was a sort of falling away of 
what she termed “a growing school-teacherish rigid- 
ity,” or a nervousness and overnicety regarding little 
things. Although she had not noticed it and could 
not place her finger upon the difficulty, her friends 
had been telling her that she was becoming a “ typical 
old-maid school teacher.” The change for the better 
seemed to come with the development in herself of 
this ability to wait and to hold off while the children 
| were struggling along with things difficult for them 
but, of course, easy for her. She found that her habit 
of rushing in when some one else was doing some- 
| thing incorrectly, of explaining and overexplaining long 
after her listeners understood, and of watching for a 
special relationship to herself of the numerous unim- 
| portant actions of her companions had carried over 
from her school work and had caused others to note 
| that she was becoming a bore. 
| Waiting and keeping in the background with her chil- 
dren thus developed in the teacher the ability to be a whole- 
some and desirable companion and friend to other adults.   
Tue SIGNIFICANCE OF CHILD INDEPENDENCE 
Child Initiative. — A basic purpose of school train- 
ing is to develop children so that they can do good work 
without anyone to oversee them. School assignments

  THE TEACHER IN THE BACKGROUND 101 
as well as the mechanical factors of school life must be 
planned with the aim of developing a sense of respon- 
sibility. In addition to the sense of responsibility, 
definite training in achieving what he attempts is 
necessary before the child is fully educated. Here 
again the simple details of school work furnish oppor- 
tunity for valuable training. In fact, so simple and 
ordinarily so tiresome a process as that of coming in 
and going out of the schoolhouse or room may be used 
in developing initiative on the part of children. This 
same element of school work is discussed in other chap- 
ters, but it is so important that it will do no injury to 
mention it in connection with every phase of good 
teaching in which it plays a part. When children learn 
to come in and go out of the schoolhouse, take their seats 
at the proper time, borrow pencils, leave the room during 
a recitation, and talk to each other when this is necessary 
(withoyt being directed by the teacher and without asking 
for permission), the first and fundamental elements of 
education for initiative have been accomplished. Under 
a superior teacher the initiative and the good sense of 
children in all such matters are a pleasure to witness. 
A common type of failure in dealing with initiative 
is seen in the teacher who thinks» that ‘‘ something 
different from ordinary” must be done if initiative 
is to be developed. He turns liis back upon the hum- 
ble necessary daily task and looks elsewhere for some- 
thing more spectacular. But in failing to connect 
initiative with everyday tasks he loses the hundreds
-P-A-G-E-128
  102 THE EMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
of opportunities for its exercise which daily life affords. 
The type of teacher who looks for opportunity to de- 
velop initiative only in the extraordinary rarely finds 
it, and when he does, his class is not equal to the oc- 
casion. 
One of the best illustrations of what is meant by 
proper initiative and its relation to child training is 
found in the poem of James Oppenheim, called “ The 
Clinging Arms.” 
Push off the clinging arms! 
There is only death in this strangle hold; even if we call 
it love... . 
The mother who cares too much for her child, 
Or the husband for his wife, 
They are keeping sheltered and confined what should be free 
and hardy, toughened for battle! 
Nay, there is no real love in this binding ; 
It is more often a sense of waste and futility, and a fierce 
bickering and quarreling. . . . 
Shake free! 
Know love in freedom; know love in separation ; 
Give the soul its own self to support it, and take off your 
arms! 
Do honour to the divinity of another human being 
By trusting its power to go alone. 
The most trivial task may be a pleasure if in doing 
it the individual may realize the joy of responsibility. 
The intelligent mind ever balks at the yoke. Boys 
delight in smoking cigarettes, breaking the rules of a 
school, staying out late at nights, and girls develop
-P-A-G-E-129
  THE TEACHER IN THE BACKGROUND 103 
propensities equally “bad” when held down unnec- 
essarily in the little things of daily life. Boys and girls 
who react to repression in this way are sometimes the 
best and most intelligent. There is now a vast litera- 
ture upon this subject. Beginning with Freud, who 
published as early as 1904, and coming on down to 
Jung, Adler, Steckel, Tridon, White, and Brill, with 
hundreds of more or less minor writers, there has de- 
veloped a new theory of the emotions, which is incom- 
plete and insecure in places but which has established 
the fact that one of the most harmful factors in modern 
life is overrepression and overguarding on the part of 
parents and teachers. 
The superior teacher first of all makes it his funda- 
mental purpose to allow rather than to require, to 
suggest rather than to demand, to stimulate rather than 
to force, to dominate possibly at times but never to 
domineer, to trust rather than to suspect. 
One of our great statesmen explained his success 
by the remark, “ The truthfulness of. men trusted 
grows with trust.’ There is nothing that is surer to 
kill initiative or force it to break out in some unwhole- 
some direction than a domineering, suspicious, over- 
bearing, and tactless demeanor of the military type of 
“ schoolmaster.” 
Such was the schoolmaster described by Thackeray : 
“T always had my doubts about the classics when I 
saw a brute of a schoolmaster whose mind was as coarse 
as any plough-boy’s in Christendom, whose manners  
-P-A-G-E-130
‘ 
\ 
  104 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
were the most insufferable of all heaven’s creatures, 
whose lips when they were not mumbling Greek and 
Latin, were yelling out the most brutal abuse of poor, 
cowering little gentlemen. . . . Aman willslap youon 
the back and call you names because you won’t learn, 
but I never could take the proffered delicacy. The 
fingers that offered it were too dirty.” 
Contrast this attitude with that of Dante, who said 
that all he ever did was due to his old teacher Latini. 
Instead of having his doubts about the classics, these 
same classics of which Thackeray speaks, he said that 
at a very early age he learned to love them, for Latini 
was a master at stimulating and inspiring. His fun- 
damental method was one of trust rather than sus- 
picion. Nor was this trust the naive carelessness that 
approaches neglect. It could not have succeeded as 
it did if it had not been a part of a well thought out, 
world-wise plan of training. 
FREEDOM THROUGH CONQUEST 
As has already been mentioned, children should not 
be allowed to do as they please regardless of their ability 
to know what will bring them most pleasure. It would 
be merely ridiculous to contend that children could do 
as they pleased even if adults never interfered with 
them. There are two important elements in the doc- 
trine of freedom. First, the child must be trained 
until he is able to choose intelligently between bene- 
ficial and harmful courses of action. Second, after
-P-A-G-E-131
  
THE TEACHER IN THE BACKGROUND 105 
he has made his choice he usually finds that it is im- 
possible for him to execute his desires. He must, 
therefore, be trained in accomplishing what he sets 
out to do. This training is as broad as life. It must 
also be specialized. 
Training the Ability to Choose.— Children are 
born with numerous desires whose realization would 
not be beneficial to them. They also have many that 
are purely individual which prevent them from fully 
codperating with others. These desires, if allowed 
to work themselves out unhindered, would bring ruin 
to both the race and the individual. The individual 
must be trained to choose between beneficial and de- 
structive interests. This training cannot be brought 
about through complete control by adults. The child 
must choose for himself. His power of choice must 
receive the exercise necessary to develop it. 
The right amount of freedom is always a difficult 
question. This is one of the reasons why teachers must 
be chosen from among the most intelligent. All the 
rules in the world could not show an unintelligent 
teacher how to give the proper amount of liberty to 
children. Added to this difficulty is the one of different 
intelligence levels among children. Every child can- 
not be given the same suggestions. 
The Conquest of Infancy. — Beginning before school 
age, when the child desires to crawl about, the mother 
who prevents this and keeps him “ away from dirt ” 
takes the first step in making him a weak personality.
-P-A-G-E-132
  106 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
On the other hand, when the child is allowed to crawl 
at will, death, serious injury, or sickness is likely to 
result. There are hundreds of like situations that 
occur in the care of a growing infant. When he cries, 
to what extent must the parents answer? When he 
wants foods of all sorts that are not good for him, how 
should he be dealt with? When he wants the property 
of other children, sharp instruments, unhygienic play- 
things, as newspapers to chew, and fragile decorations 
which he would be sure to break, the wise parent does 
not settle these situations offhand. He works to es- 
tablish a balance between prohibition and indulgence. 
One can say definitely of this situation, that children 
who rarely or never get dirty, who never quarrel with 
other children, who do no breaking or destroying, who 
never get any painful bumps or bruises, and who are 
taught to mind so well that they never disobey or de- 
ceive their parents, are overtrained. Not complete 
adult domination but the right amount of guidance, 
stimulation, suggestion, and as a last resort compul- 
sion is necessary. 
The Child’s Conquest over Himself and the Duties 
and Relationships of School Life.— Upon entering 
school a child faces numerous problems. For the first 
time in his life, probably, he is asked to work upon 
organized tasks that run on from day to day with no 
end in sight. He must now work in coéperation with 
a teacher. On the playground he finds numerous 
other children with desires as individual as his own.
-P-A-G-E-133
  THE TEACHER IN THE BACKGROUND 107 
This is the situation that makes the American school 
so valuable. 
When teachers deal with this combination of factors 
in such a way as to allow the child to work out his own 
salvation through the conquest of himself as well as 
by overcoming objects that stand in the way of the 
realization of his legitimate desires, we have one of 
the most wonderful educational situations that the 
world has up to now been able to devise. America is 
a century ahead of Europe in education of this type. 
Tf he goes to a good school, the child will arise each 
morning to a new day of conquest. He will have to 
work out play situations, and these will often be nu- 
merous enough to satisfy his heart’s desires and exacting 
enough to furnish exercise for the best intellectual effort 
he can put forth. Under proper stimulation he will also 
be just as anxious to deal successfully with the problems 
suggested by his teacher. When he meets these prob- 
lems in the right way and is able partially to master 
them, he is free to the extent that he is able to cope with 
the life around him successfully. There is no slavery 
more abject than that of the child who is constantly 
under the eyes of adults. Whether he be overguarded 
and protected, held down by traditional Puritanic ideals 
of parents, or kept most of his time at work not of his 
own choosing, the results are similar in that his inner

¥ 
nature does not get opportunity to develop through 
exercise. There is no conquest in this case. 
Conquest of School Subjects and Life Work. — As 
he grows older the child must realize his inner aspira- 
tions by dealing properly with school subjects and later 
on with his life work. To the extent that this struggle 
becomes one between the individual and the work he 
is to master, education is successful. The worker is 
a slave if he will not work without a boss. If he cannot 
plan work for himself as well as execute his plans, he 
is a tool in the hands of anyone who desires to exploit 
him. Therefore, the teacher must work to get children 
to study of their own accord; to take subjects in school 
because they understand their need for them; to read 
books in literature because they desire to read them rather 
than because they are required; to choose a calling 
because they know that they like the work as well as 
from the standpoint of earning money. 
Such teaching is often difficult to realize. Sometimes 
realization occurs long after the teaching has ceased. 
To the extent that a class works of its own accord the 
teacher realizes true education. Even when entire 
success is not possible from this standpoint, it is worth 
working for. A child may seem to be of such nature 
that he cannot be appealed to. In that case we must 
show him what is good for him, make sure ourselves 
that it really is good for him, and then in as inoffen- 
sive a way as possible require him to do it. Following 
this, the superior teacher never ceases to work for inner

response. He is never quite satisfied with his work 
until this has been developed, and when it has, the re- 
sult is always greater than the immediate records show. 
Thus, freedom is a matter of conquest. The indi- 
vidual must be taught how to secure his own free- 
dom. There is no freedom in a life of ease where one 
is dependent upon others. There is no freedom when 
the individual is ruled entirely by his own desires. He 
must control his wants for the property of others, for 
food, drugs, play, and work. The person who cannot 
quit work for proper recreation or necessary rest is, of 
course, a slave. The one who plays all the time and 
has not mastered anything well enough to do something 
useful in this world is a slave of another type. We all 
realize our freedom by being permitted to work out our 
destinies under surroundings that suffice to bring about 
the most development. 
SUMMARY AND SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE 
In this chapter we have considered in detail a factor 
of teaching which has been a center of controversy 
for a long time. In American education, a fairly gen- 
eral agreement has been reached regarding some of the 
important phases of this controversy. These may be 
helpfully summarized in the form of precepts: 
1. Keep in mind that good teaching demands more 
activity in the classroom on the part of the pupils 
than on the part of the teacher. Almost every teacher 
will find it possible to improve his work by learning 
 
-P-A-G-E-136
  110 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
to talk less and to devote more time to the study of 
the reactions of the children. 
2. When the teacher takes his place in the back- 
ground, he must keep in mind that he is still a vital part 
of all that is going on. In fact he now becomes a much 
more important and effective element than the teacher 
who makes himself the main performer. He still has 
his aims to achieve, but now he works for them with 
his hand upon the pulse of the class. He no longer 
hurries along calling upon the children to follow, but 
persistently, silently, and much more surely the class 
moves ahead to achievements won by its own efforts. 
3. Do not forget that a few independent achieve- 
ments may be worth more to a child than are a large 
number learned from others. 
4. Remember that initiative and freedom do not mean 
that “ children do just as they please” or that they be 
allowed to injure themselves or others. 
5. Keep in mind that first efforts at independent work 
* are likely to need a great deal of supervision and guidance. 
Look upon the child’s efforts as a process of acquiring 
freedom through conquest. The fight will last through- 
out his life. In practice we cannot afford to allow him 
to injure himself, attempt impossible tasks until he 
becomes discouraged, or spend his time in activity 
that is worthless. 
6. On the other hand he must be taught to choose 
his own work and to continue at apparently impossible 
tasks until he has by his own efforts overcome them.

IMPROVEMENT THROUGH SOCIALIZATION 
Tuer MEANING AND VALUE OF SOCIALIZATION IN 
THE Common SCHOOL 
An Illustration. — The effect of applying socialized 
methods to eighth-grade arithmetic in the city of St. 
Louis is described by W. C. Reavis! as follows : 
“A mock bank was organized in which each member of a 
class studying stocks became a stockholder. Certificates of 
stock and other commercial forms connected with banking 
were worked out and printed. These certificates were then 
sold in different denominations to the different members of 
the class. This stock was sold at market quotations which 
were listed on a bulletin board by ‘officials’ at different 
times during the recitation. The pupils thus became con- 
versant very quickly with the terms used in stock transac- 
tions and understood the effects of changes in prices on the 
value of their personal stock already purchased. 
“ Problems in buying and selling were next undertaken by 
the class and the results worked out first for the individual 
directly concerned in the transaction and then for the cor- 
poration. The newspaper quotations were carefully noted 
in this connection, and hypothetical problems were made

up and discussed by the class. When purchases and sales 
were made and dividends or deficits declared the appropriate 
commercial forms were used in completing the transaction. 
This afforded excellent practice in the use of conventional 
forms, such as deposit slips, checks, and notes.” 
Following this work a test was given. The problems 
were taken from the Stone and Southworth Arithmetic, Book 
III, p. 194. The time was arbitrarily set at twenty-five 
minutes, and work stopped when time was called. The 
following are the problems, given here to illustrate their 
difficulty : 
1. What is the market value of 35 shares of Northwestern 
stock at 433 per cent above par? 
2. What would be the value of the same stock if sold at 
the same rate below par? 
3. I receive a stock dividend of $1728. This is at the 
rate of 142 per cent on the par value of my investment. How 
much of the stock do I own? 
4, A man exchanges 170 shares of stock worth 103 in the 
market for a cottage on the seaside valued at $8510. The 
difference was made up in mill stock at a par value of 50 per 
share. How many shares were there? Leave brokerage 
out of the account. 
5. A gentleman bought 1200 shares of railroad stock at 
115 and was glad to sell it at 58. What did he lose? 
6. The Atlantic Steamship Company is capitalized at 
$8,000,000. The receipts for the year are $16,400,000. The 
expenses are $14,800,000; $600,000 is put into a reserve 
fund and the remainder distributed as a dividend. What 
rate per cent of dividend was declared? 
7. How many hundred-dollar shares of mining stock can 
be bought at 188 for $3750, and what sum will remain? 
(Parts of a share are not sold.)
-P-A-G-E-142
114 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
8. I receive $2133 as the net profits of stock bought at 
par and sold at 107. How many hundred-dollar shares were 
sold, allowing + brokerage? 
9. My broker paid me $8585 which he received for Old 
Colony railroad stock sold for me at } brokerage. How many 
shares did he sell at 215? 
10. In the N. Y. stock market 50,000 shares of railroad 
stock were bought at a premium of 222, and sold the next 
day at a premium of 263. The brokerage in each case 
being 4, required the profits. 
“The class work was completed March 15, 1917,” to quote 
further, ‘‘and the foregoing test was given March 16. There 
were 28 pupils in the class. Of these 21 were present and 
took the test. Fifteen pupils worked all the problems cor- 
rectly in twenty-five minutes, two pupils had nine right 
out of nine attempts and three had seven right out of seven 
attempts.” 
The lasting influence of the work is shown by the results of 
the same test given on September 5, 1917, following an in- 
terval of 90 days in school (during which time no attention 
had been given to stocks) and a vacation of 80 days. Of the 
fifteen pupils who had ten rights out of ten attempts, thirteen 
again made perfect scores in the same time, one fell to eight 
rights out of eight attempts, and one was not present to take 
the test. One pupil raised his score from seven rights out of 
seven attempts to nine rights out of nine attempts; one from 
seven rights out of seven attempts to eight rights out of eight 
attempts; one from eight rights out of nine attempts to nine 
rights out of nine attempts; one changed from nine rights out 
of nine attempts to nine rights out of ten attempts ; andone 
who was absent from the first test made a score of nine rights 
out of nine attempts. 
This illustration, which is one of hundreds that
-P-A-G-E-143
  IMPROVEMENT THROUGH SOCIALIZATION 115 
could be given, for socialized teaching now makes up 
a large part of the work of every modern school, is 
used as an introduction to a discussion of socialization 
because it contains elements that every teacher who 
attempts to do this type of work must never lose sight 
of. All the possibilities of the social movement cannot 
be portrayed by any one illustration, but several years’ 
experience in training teachers in the use of modern 
methods has revealed that they need to know certain 
facts and principles, which must be used in making the 
right kind of beginning and must be kept in mind as 
long as such work is continued. These facts and 
principles are: 
1. More and better results in a regular school 
subject were brought about by socialization than is 
accomplished by traditional teaching. 
2. These results were lasting. 
3. The work was done in an ordinary common school 
under typical school conditions. 
4. In addition to the above, training in codperation, 
organization, group initiative, and other important 
essentials of modern existence was given. 
Regular school work in larger amounts, of a more 
worthy type, and of more lasting quality than could 
be accomplished under traditional methods is an 
essential aim of any genuine scheme of socialization. 
In addition modern life demands that our children re- 
ceive training that will fit them to take their places as 
units of the social scheme upon which modern civiliza- 
 
-P-A-G-E-144
116 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
tion is built. With these premises before us in the 
form of a concrete illustration we are less likely to go 
astray in applying ideas and principles that are more 
complex. 
A World Movement of Far-Reaching Importance. — 
It is possible that two important sciences of the future 
will be sociology and education. Both are at present 
only in their beginning stages. The human element 
at the basis of everything pertaining to civilization, 
together with the fact that man’s further evolution 
must be social evolution, makes scientific sociology one 
of the most essent‘al as well as one of the surest devel- 
opments of the twentieth century. Every branch of 
knowledge, every human activity must eventually 
derive the right to its existence and even its method of 
procedure from social science. Education is the big 
vital element as well as the hope of scientific sociology. 
Man’s possibilities under the influence of these two 
great sciences exceed anything that the imagination 
can at this time depict. 
It is necessary that the teacher understand the im- 
portant movement which aims consciously to control 
social evolution. He should first of all recognize the 
extent of the idea, its complexity, and the need for a 
long period of growth on his own part before he can 
begin to realize many of its advantages. 
Socialization Not a Finished Idea. — Because it is 
new and only in the beginning stages, many find 
difficulty in seeing the significance of socialization.
-P-A-G-E-145
IMPROVEMENT THROUGH SOCIALIZATION 117 
Like all new developments this one has yet to go through 
a long period of growth. Thus the teacher who desires 
to apply any of the principles will find that he must 
do a great deal of thinking beyond the limits of everyday 
procedure. However, this is the type of work that 
makes teaching interesting to those who desire to grow. 
It must be kept in mind that educators everywhere 
are beginning to realize the importance of socialization 
in education. Even though full realization cannot 
be expected for a long time, the teacher who is able to 
gather enough of the ideas to use them for a background 
will make a great improvement in his work. Thus, it 
behooves all of us to do our best to understand, make 
use of, and further this movement. 
Three Phases of Socialized Teaching. — In teaching 
from the social point of view it is necessary to consider 
(1) the aims, (2) the medium or subject matter! and 
(3) the method. One of these without the others is 
likely to result in only partial success. The “ socialized 
recitation ”’ in which children do most of the work, 
call upon each other, and so on, is only one small phase 
of socialized teaching.” It is necessary first to master 
the principles and then apply them in a variety of 
ways. ‘There is no set procedure that can be called 
“ socialization.” It is rather a large background of 
attitudes and principles that cover all the work of the 
school. 
1 Social values in subject matter are illustrated in Chapter XII.

-P-A-G-E-146
  118 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
SocraL Aims IN TEACHING 
The Importance of Social Aims. — With a good 
understanding of social aims, the teacher is able to 
change the status of all his work. Lessons, which 
without proper social emphasis would have been little 
more than mechanical repetition, take on new sig- 
nificance. Even dull routine may be changed so that 
it becomes a valuable part of the educative process. 
Discipline, once dreaded by both teacher and children, 
is changed to morale, which is the essence of the new 
social order. The monotony of the hundreds of daily 
duties gives way to eager, happy activity. 
What Are the Social Aims? — Arranged in order of 
their importance the chief social aims are: 
1. To give the child thorough training in the wisdom, 
science, and arts of the race as these have been de- 
veloped up to the present time. The suggestion here is 
not to turn away from anything of value that we 
already have because we are developing a new point of 
view. However, socialization demands that human 
knowledge be viewed in an entirely new light. The 
plan of socialization is to make use of everything in 
the past or present that will serve to develop the future 
citizen; to do better work in the “three R’s,’” for 
example, but at the same time look upon these as merely 
a minimum essential of a vastly larger equipment. 
2. Codperation. This is the great virtue of modern 
times. It combines all the traditional virtues such as
-P-A-G-E-147
  
IMPROVEMENT THROUGH SOCIALIZATION 119 
honesty, sobriety, modesty, and order into a definite, 
tangible conception. It has the added value of being 
highly practical. The child can be taught to see 
numerous ways in which codperation is helpful in his 
daily existence. 
It is the aim of socialized teaching to use codperation 
both as a means and,an end. As a means it will make 
it possible forthe school to achieve much more thanit 
did in the past. As an end in itself, codperation will 
increase the values of education in proportion to the 
extent it becomes a dynamic force in those who are edu- 
cated. Both as means and end it is one of the most prac- 
tical and useful conceptions of the twentieth century ; 
not that the word or the idea is new; it is only their 
central emphasis in sociology and education that is new. 
As a means, codperation makes it possible to use the 
traditional class in a way that will help rather than 
hinder the individual. It makes use of and develops SS 
both the strong and the weak, the rapid and the slow, 
those with good home surroundings and those with 
negative outside influences. It enlarges the possibilities 
of operation of the class in proportion to its size, while 
the traditional method was injured by each addition 
to the number taught. It extends the scope of edu- 
cation from the school to the home and to the com- 
munity. Just how these and many other values of 
codperation as a means are realized will be discussed in 
the section on “ Socialized Methods” and illustrated 
throughout the book.

120 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
Coéperation as an end in education is the hope of 
those who wish to make the world safe for democracy. 
When modern man thoroughly appreciates the values 
of codperation and also has undergone thorough train- 
ing in codperative activities, civilization will take on new 
life. The way he greets his neighbor, his attitude 
toward his employer or his employee, his interest in the 
general welfare, the way he pays his bills and his 
attitude toward those who for good reasons are not 
| able to pay their bills, his interest in getting something 
| for himself or for some one else, his ability to make 
| himself valuable as a part of a group, and literally 
hundreds of the elemental factors of daily life will be 
lifted to a higher plane. A modern education must 
train one to know when and how to yield to his fellow 
man as well as when and how to enlist the aid of others, 
to the eventual benefit of all concerned. This is the 
advantage of the great corporation in which hundreds 
join capital, initiative, and effort in such a way as to 
bring to each more than he could possibly acquire 
alone. In the past the ability to organize in this way 
was regarded as a matter of intuition and native en- 
dowment. We are now learning that training can 
develop such ability in persons of normal intelligence. 
3. Codperation embraces all the other social aims, 
but their specific statement will make the larger idea 
more understandable. Among them are group activ- 
ities, individual and group initiative, wholesome com- 
petition which trains the individual to take his place 
 
-P-A-G-E-149
IMPROVEMENT THROUGH SOCIALIZATION 121 
and keep it under varying conditions, making use of the 
different natural social groups as well as furthering their 
existence; such groups are the family, clubs, lodges, 
churches, business concerns, etc. Of all the groups the 
one least likely to be used in traditional teaching and 
yet the most obvious as well as the most productive of 
results is the school. Socialized teaching has for one of its 
basic aims the full functioning of the entire school in the 
education of each indwidual child together with the best 
possible use of each individual in the development of the 
entire school. It might be well to say schools, for inter- 
school activities and interests are vital to socializa- 
tion. 
With these issues before him the teacher should be 
able to appreciate something of the significance of 
socialization and to realize its values. He must aim: 
(1) to teach the subjects of the curriculum better than 
ever before but so to deal with them that their human 
values will be emphasized; (2) to make use of co- 
operation as a definite part of his method as well as 
an immediate and ultimate end; and (3) to employ in the 
process of training, every valuable social means that is 
in existence today, with the far-reaching purpose of 
eventually elevating the entire social order. 
Soctat Mrtuops oF TEACHING 
There are three special methods that seem well 
adapted to the aims of socialization. These are (1) the 
project method, (2) the formation and organization 
 
-P-A-G-E-150
122 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
of natural groups, and (3) a reorganization of the 
traditional recitation so as to utilize social means and 
further social ends. 
Socialization through Projects. —The project method 
provides an ideal scheme for socialization. It cannot 
be described in detail here and it is necessary for any- 
one who desires to become proficient in its use to read 
first the literature on the subject and then train himself 
to apply it. The project idea is one of the most im- 
portant and most valuable educational conceptions in 
the field of method and curricula. The method in all 
its modern application is complex enough to warrant 
long and careful attention by every teacher who desires 
to succeed. “It contains much that is both new and 
old,” to quote Bagley. Its present position as the 
center of discussion is due largely to Kilpatrick and his 
associates at Teachers College in New York City. 
They have been able to combine in the project most of 
the valuable ideas on method that have been developed 
up to this time. Stated briefly from the social point of 
view the project embodies : 
1. Some Task, Plan, Investigation, or Idea upon 
Which a Group May Combine Effort.—In this com- 
bination of effort for a definite purpose the children 
learn (1) how to work together effectively, (2) to 
realize the value of combined effort, (3) to divide labor, 
and so on; and they acquire the distinct advantage of 
(1) many heads and many hands focused upon some- 
thing that each individual desires for himself, but which 
 
-P-A-G-E-151
IMPROVEMENT THROUGH SOCIALIZATION 123 
he could not acquire alone and (2) the stimulation of 
group loyalty and of social motives of every type. 
2. A Task or Problem Chosen by the Children and the 
Teacher Working Together. — It thus has many social 
advantages over an assignment given by the teacher 
alone, for work done under external pressure always 
has its drawbacks. It is also superior to a method 
which allows the child to be his own guide, for a 
wise and sympathetic teacher can furnish hundreds 
of interesting suggestions, valuable advice, and 
render service in the furthering of the project. We 
must not forget that the teacher is a distinct social 
. asset both from the child’s and the educator’s point of 
view. 
3. A Central Unifying Element of Enough Duration 
to Hold the Members Together. — The common purpose 
is an ideal social cement. After working together on a 
few projects a class and its teacher can accomplish 
things that would have seemed impossible before. 
4. A Project May Bring the Community and the School 
Together. — Since most projects go beyond the con- 
fines of the school, they serve in bringing the com- 
munity and the school together. When the different 
elements of the community come to be used as edu- 
cational means to the extent that their values warrant, 
we shall not only have larger educational means at 
our disposal, we shall not only see larger educational 
results, but we may also witness an awakening of the 
community to the value of public education. Business

| men! will see in the school a medium for legitimate 
advertising for products that are of genuine merit, the 
place where an understanding of the true worth of 
every enterprise may be established. 
Other social values could be given, but something 
more than an enumeration is essential to establish 
socialization through projects as a part of school 
practice. The teacher is advised to read the references 
given at the bottom of this page as a beginning for his 
work with projects.? 
The Formation and.Organization of Natural Groups. 
— Group organization is valuable from two standpoints. 
First, children need training in the formation of groups 
for effective work. If all the school children of this

country receive thorough training in organization, in 
combining their efforts to discover and solve problems, 
the next generation will be better fitted to cope with the 
difficulties that are sure to arise. Second, the natural 
group is one of the most stimulating factors in a so- 
cialized school. A boy will work harder for the team 
or the club than he will for himself. He will quit 
smoking, go to bed early, and urge his fellows to do 
likewise, when by so doing he can help his group. A 
frivolous girl will give up high-heeled shoes, silk stock- 
ings, and an affected attitude when her club goes on 
record as approving a simple, straightforward, and 
wholesome life. 
What is a Natural Group? — A natural group is one 
whose members are united by acommon purpose. This | 
is why the project serves the ends of socialization so | 
well. However, a group may be formed with a more | 
general background and with more remote ends than 
a single project can furnish. Such a group may dis- 
cover and carry out hundreds of projects, gradually 
becoming firmly united and efficient through their 
experiences. 
The traditional class was an artificial group. It had 
no common causes; unless, perhaps, the semi-uncon- 
scious cause of pupil against teacher. Ordinarily, 
however, when their sympathy for each other did not 
unite them against the teacher, the children worked 
along separate lines. Each recitation was a matter 
between the individual making it and the teacher. It 
 
-P-A-G-E-154
  126 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
was essentially time wasted by the rest of the class. 
What value could John’s difficulty with an arithmetic 
problem have for a class whose members either already 
knew how to surmount the difficulty or were not 
interested in learning through bothering themselves 
about John’s special troubles? 
How an Artificial Group May Be Changed into a 
Natural Group. — In the chapters that follow numerous 
illustrations will show the formation of natural groups. 
In changing an artificial group into a club, society, or 
organization two principles should be kept in mind. 
1. Shift responsibility from the teacher to the entire 
group. Note that this does not mean from the teacher 
to the class. The group is made up of the teacher and 
the class. The teacher is there to play a part, and it is 
here that the first big difficulty is encountered. Just 
how to weld thirty or forty individuals into a responsible 
group and at the same time take his place upon the 
correct level as an element of this group is a difficult 
problem for the best of teachers. One must not expect 
very much at first. Both the class and the teacher 
will gain a great deal with experience. 
A teacher who knows how can solve the most difficult 
problems of organization without taking any unneces- 
sary burdens upon himself and without assuming too 
much responsibility. On the other hand a class that 
has been working from the social point of view for a 
number of years is a great help to a teacher who has 
done no work of this kind. Observations have been
-P-A-G-E-155
  IMPROVEMENT THROUGH SOCIALIZATION 127 
made of classes that went far beyond the expectations 
of the teachers, who reported that they would never 
have thought of asking children to do what was done 
voluntarily. The teacher should take for his guiding 
principle the desire to see the children succeed without 
help whenever this is possible, and when he finds it 
necessary to help, he should work so as to allow the 
group to lose none of its initiative. 
2. It is always best to rely upon some system or form 
of procedure. This will serve as an anchor when dis- 
putes arise. It makes a more natural settlement to 
refer to Robert’s “ Rules of Order” than is possible 
when the teacher must pass judgment and be his 
own authority for his decision. When a child objects 
to some action as being “contrary to the principles 
upon which this class (club or organization) was 
founded,” even should the question eventually come 
to the teacher for settlement, there is no necessity to 
discriminate against persons. 
Changing the Plan of the Traditional Recitation. — 
Project teaching and the formation of a group with a 
background more general than a project, are, of course, 
ways of reorganizing the traditional recitation so as to 
utilize social motives and furnish social training. But 
there are a number of ways of vitalizing the recitation 
through socialization when it is not possible to follow 
either of the two methods already described. To bring 
about this modification recitations should be based 
upon the following aims:  
-P-A-G-E-156
  128 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
1. Every child who recites must speak to the entire 
group, the class, and the teacher. 
2. He must speak loudly enough for every one to 
hear. 
3. He must enunciate clearly. 
4, He must arrange his subjects, predicates, phrases, 
and sentences so that his meaning will be clear to every 
one. 
5. He must avoid waste of time by (a) keeping to 
the point, (b) leaving out unnecessary detail, (c) avoid- 
ing too much repetition, and (d) knowing when to stop 
talking. 
These five points could be amplified so as to take up 
the space of a chapter. If all recitations were social- 
ized to the extent of making them the basis for all 
discussion, the child who graduates from the elementary 
school would develop the ability to speak effectively to 
individuals and to groups. This is a fundamental 
essential of socialization. At present much time is lost, 
issues are clouded, unfortunate issues are allowed to 
win, and numerous other difficulties arise because 
persons who are well informed do not know how to 
express themselves, because persons who know little 
are allowed to control meetings, and because people 
generally are incompetent when it comes to explaining 
their actions and motives. This daily recitation in 
which children talk to each other can be made a power- 
ful element in the furtherance of civilization if the above 
social features are incorporated in standard procedure. 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
  IMPROVEMENT THROUGH SOCIALIZATION 129 
If we add a sixth point, it is possible at least to point 
the recitation in a direction that should serve to change 
the artificial group into a more natural group. This is: 
6. Every child should have for his recitation some- 
thing that will add to the knowledge of the group. 
Children should be trained to ask questions that are of 
more than individual importance. There should be a 
period during the day or at the end of each recitation 
for individual questions, and children should early learn 
not to interfere with the work of the class by asking 
questions or making statements that do not interest 
others. Careful experiment has shown that third- 
grade children can develop considerable ability to ask 
intelligent questions and to make worth-while state- 
ments. With increasing age and training, classes 
learn to do excellent reciting from this standpoint. In 
the upper grades teachers will find it profitable to 
require each child to make his individual contribution 
to each recitation as well as do the regular work of 
studying the general assignment. 
On their part the children who make up the rest of 
the class owe it to the one who is making a contribution 
to give him their undivided attention, to criticize his 
weak points, and to compliment his successes. 
The observation of hundreds of recitations which 
were conducted with these six factors as a basis has 
convinced the writer that children can be trained to a 
high state of efficiency in group discussion, that they 
can and do learn to attack their questions and topics

  CHAPTER VI 
THE CLASSROOM TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 
Ture PROBLEMS OF THE TEACHER 
A study of the attitudes of superior teachers and 
experience with the measurement programs of several 
large cities indicate that the growing teacher is asking 
the following questions on the subject of educational 
and mental measurements : 
1. What should the attitude of the classroom 
teacher be towards the measurement movement ? 
2. When should children be measured ? 
3. What basic principles should be adhered to in 
giving tests? 
4. What elements of school work should be meas- 
ured, and, if only partial measurement is possible, what 
functions should be selected for testing? 
5. What may be done in the way of attempting 
to reach definite standards? 
6. What errors are frequently made which may be 
avoided by teachers who are informed on the ques- 
tions at issue?

132 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
  
TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 133 
this subject one hundred per cent of those who were 
selected to represent the superior group were firm 
believers in proper scientific measurement. As a group 
successful teachers can be reported as being very much 
interested in the measurement movement. They ad- 
vocated that the work of their children be measured ; 
many were giving tests in their own rooms in school 
systems where superintendents and principals were 
still doubtful about educational tests. It does not 
seem to occur to the teacher who is well read and is 
doing good work that scientific measurement is more 
likely to result in unfair reports of his work than is 
the commonly used method of superintendents and 
principals of passing judgment without any objective 
measures. They see the chance of danger from meas- 
urement by untrained persons or from the lack of 
common sense in the use of results, but most of the 
better teachers think of measurement as being help- 
ful in giving them a better knowledge of the work of 
the children in their rooms. The idea that their teach- 
ing might be judged unfairly as the result of measure- 
ment did not unduly disturb them. 
Tests Not Used as Much as They Should Be. — Not- 
withstanding the fact that they are comparatively 
simple, standardized tests have not been used to the 
extent that their values warrant. I have at hand data 
from an investigation of the use that is being made of 
tests and measurements throughout the United States. 
Wherever they are used intelligently as a basic part 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  134 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
of school work they are welcomed by progressive 
teachers. However, even in many of our large cities, 
where a great many teachers seem to know the value 
of such work, only a surprisingly small amount of 
testing is being done. 
The chief reason given by teachers and superintend- 
ents for not using tests and measurements is that as 
yet “ tests haven’t been invented to measure the most 
important phases of education.” They feel that 
those who have devised tests have given too much at- 
tention to mechanical abilities and factual knowledge. 
However, ‘the only way to overcome such a situation 
is for the teachers and superintendents to employ the 
tests that have already been devised in a carefully 
planned program of measurement, and to demand 
tests to measure other elements of education that are 
not entirely mechanical or factual. Demand is sure 
to result in production. 
A second reason given by careful superintendents 
for being slow to adopt an extensive program of mental 
and educational tests is the danger of measurement 
by unprepared and inexperienced persons. Along with 
this danger goes that from attitudes taken by teachers 
as well as parents towards the results of tests. It is 
almost impossible to control the use that may be made 
of these results. The teacher interested in tests should 
realize that this objection is a good one. No teacher 
should act upon the results of a standardized test until 
a thorough study has been made of every side of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-163
  TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 135 
problem involved. Mental tests are even more com- 
plicated, and it would be a safe rule to follow that 
thorough courses of training in mental and educational 
measurements should be part of the preparation of 
every prospective teacher, while those who have gone 
out without this training should take either summer 
classes or reading courses upon these subjects. 
Some Reasons for Using Standardized Tests. —The 
necessity for measurement comes from the fact that 
the more nearly we know whether or not a child is 
growing in a normal way the easier it is to deal properly 
with him. Standardized tests of intelligence (always 
to be used in conjunction with other measures and ob- 
servations) will. provide-a—basis-for_judgment as to 
whether children are normal, subnormal, or supernor- 
mal, Tests in addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division indicate whether or not children are be- 
low, at, or above normal in any of these functions. 
Tests in silent reading furnish such information on 
this phase of reading; the result being that we can 
deal with children in accordance with their needs. 
If a boy is up to standard (that set by his school) in 
arithmetic but below in silent reading, he may be 
taught accordingly. If he appears to be very far 
behind in intelligence, he should not be expected — 
far less coerced — to reach the standards that bright 
pupils can easily attain. If his intelligence appears to 
be high, it is likely that there are other causes for his 
backwardness in reading. It may be due to lack of 
 
-P-A-G-E-164
  136 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
training in lower grades. He may be lazy, or he may 
lack vitality. When we do not have information on 
these points, it is obvious that we are teaching in the 
dark. When the teacher knows that John, who is fail- 
ing, makes low scores in intelligence tests; that Henry, 
who is also failing, makes superior scores in the same 
tests, does he not have a distinct advantage in teach- 
ing both children? Too often the teacher reports that 
both failed “‘ because they were not capable of doing 
the work.” Since intelligence tests have indicated 
that many children lack normal mentality, it has be- 
come too common for teachers to suspect the intelli- 
gence of all those who do not do so well as they expect. 
Mental tests can be very helpful in the present statc 
of affairs in order to prevent many children from being 
underrated. 
Proper measurement is an aid to the teacher, not a 
final indication of anything, and it is his duty to use 
the means which have recently been discovered to 
bring to bear as much light as possible upon all teach- 
ing problems. We owe it to the child to make use of 
this means in helping to understand whether or not 
he is doing what he should. If tests indicate that he 
is naturally backward, care should be taken to avoid 
nagging, scolding, ridicule, or other blind and often 
abortive methods of exerting pressure. When the 
child appears to be superior, it is only just to him and 
to society that this appearance of superiority be given 
a chance to develop. The teacher who objects to the
-P-A-G-E-165
  
TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 137 
measurement of the children in his classes is objecting 
to something humane and necessary. 
Suggestions on When to Measure. — Measurement 
should begin early in the year. When about three 
weeks have passed after the beginning of school, the chil- 
dren have become adjusted to school work so that they 
are in condition to be tested. Following the first tests 
others should be given at frequent intervals. These 
show progress or the lack of it. If the first tests are 
given during the first week, the next test will not be a 
sure indication of improvement as a result of proper 
teaching. The improvement will be the result of ad- 
justment to school conditions. After a long vacation 
it takes some time to get into the swing of school 
work. 
It should also be added here that when a second 
test shows considerable improvement over the first 
one, the result may be due to the fact that the chil- 
dren have become accustomed to being tested. Failures 
are often made in first tests and low scores result when 
children have not been tested frequently. Very often 
schools report gains when the only cause of such gains 
is the fact that the children have learned to meet the 
test conditions. 
Tests should be frequent because children should 
become accustomed to being tested. To learn to do 
his best under test conditions without becoming un- 
duly excited is something very necessary for every 
one. Frequent tests also show the teacher whether
-P-A-G-E-166
138 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
or not progress is being made. But there is another 
and more important reason for frequent tests, the 
factor of reliability. One or two tests are not very 
reliable. Many chance factors may cause peculiar 
scores. But half a dozen tests are likely to bring 
out the truth. In this work the truth is very 
desirable. 
Hasty judgments from single tests are likely to 
cause a great deal of trouble. Some enthusiasts con- 
tend that such information is better than the old way 
of merely guessing, but experience seems to show that 
such information should be guarded because the in- 
dividual who has it feels justified in acting upon it. 
When children are judged upon the basis of one or two 
tests by an individual who feels that he has been 
“ scientific” and who insists upon ‘“ doing something 
about it,” the results of such testing are more 
dangerous than “ guessing” because the one who 
guessed ordinarily did not feel justified in acting very 
strenuously about it. Let us repeat, then, tests should 
come early in the term, they should be repeated often, and 
should serve as a basis for selection and emphasis. One 
cure for a test which does not give us the correct situation 
is more tests. 
Suggestions for Giving Tests. — Too much caution 
cannot be taken in seeing that the conditions of the 
test are carried out to the letter. A slight change in 
directions may cause a big difference in the scores. 
Standardization is possible only with standard proce-
-P-A-G-E-167
TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 139 
dure. Be sure that some arrangement is made so 
that the time may be kept without a chance of a mis- 
take. It is best to form the habit of jotting down on a 
piece of paper the time when the signal to stop is to 
be given. The children should be given frequent 
drills in “attention”, which means pencils up; “go”, 
which means write; and “stop ”’, which means cease 
writing. This practice, in itself, is worth while, for 
every one may profit by some drill in carrying out 
directions. Materials should be so handled that uni- 
form conditions will be maintained. When sheets 
are to be turned over, every child should be trained to 
do exactly as ordered. Some children work with the 
hands and the paper in disadvantageous positions. 
In one half-hour test one child observed by the writer 
was able to do twenty-five per cent better when his 
working position was corrected. 
At present, we have a number of “ standardized ” 
tests which were developed by hundreds of teachers 
each of whom worked in his own way. The validity 
of such standardization is doubtful. Let us repeat, 
the teacher or anyone who gives tests cannot be too care- 
ful to meet the conditions of standardization exactly. 
Such work may result in injury to the children unless 
we know that it was done in a way that makes com- 
parison with standard performance possible. When, 
for illustration, the teacher is interested in the class 
and forgets to note the time until after four minutes 
have passed and then concludes that probably only
-P-A-G-E-168
140 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
two minutes have passed, his group has an advantage 
of forty per cent over the standard in a five-minute 
test. This is a typical occurrence. 
What to Measure. — First of all, it is necessary to 
measure enough of the work of a school to get a fair 
estimate of the work done rather than accidental 
scores in subjects of secondary importance. Many 
schools make the mistake, for example, of giving only 
a certain very popular test in arithmetic. Where ob- 
servation was made in these schools, addition, sub- 
traction, etc., were frequently given too much at- 
tention. This was not due to the fact that tests were 
given. It merely indicated that they had not been 
used wisely. In several cases teachers were observed 
to keep children in at recess in order to have them 
practice upon the fundamentals of arithmetic after 
these tests had been given. When one ability is 
all that is measured; when each room is graphed and 
charted in accordance with scores in this test; when 
it is repeated again and again and the graphs and 
charts are given wide publicity, numerous superintend- 
ents report that teachers show every indication of an 
effort to bring up the work in this one field to the neg- 
lect of everything else. It is to be regretted that this 
short-sighted policy has been pursued in some places 
for years. In one large city certain drills were em- 
phasized to such an extent that the children grew to 
regard them as being the most important part of their 
school work.
-P-A-G-E-169
  
TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 141 
A Program ror MEASURING 
What Abilities Should Be Measured ? — As has been 
previously stated, we must measure those factors in 
school work that are fundamental so that nothing of 
importance will be neglected. Aside from the fact 
that teachers tend to stress the work that is measured, 
the chief reason for measuring the fundamentals is 
that through them we get a fair understanding of the 
children and their progress. 
The chief question, then, is “‘ What is fundamental? ” 
In order of importance the following list has been com- 
piled. 
1. General intelligence (with the understanding that 
present tests are not at all perfect) 
2. Silent reading 
3. The fundamentals of arithmetic 
4. Composition abilities (this order because composition 
scales seem more accurate than language scales at present) 
5. Language abilities 
6. Progress in history and geography 
7. Spelling 
8. Writing 
If we measure, we should, by all means, begin at 
the top of the list. It is unfair to the children when 
judgment is passed upon them without covering every 
important factor. The fact that comparisons and 
general conclusions are usually made when any measur- 
ing is done cannot be overlooked. Only recently I 
talked with a man who had been doing some of this 
 
-P-A-G-E-170
  142 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
partial measurement. He was very willing to state 
that he knew that it was unfair to make general com- 
parisons from the data at hand. Nevertheless, he 
made a detailed report in which he made such compari- 
sons, and practically every one who read the report 
was more interested in his comparisons than in his data. 
Measuring General Intelligence. — In the past few 
years this task has been greatly simplified by the in- 
vention of group tests. At the time of this writing 
there are a half-dozen good group tests. Those of 
the National Research Council will be used widely. 
The group tests make it possible to measure a large 
number of children at the same time. However, they 
are less reliable than the Binet-Simon or its revisions, 
but they are more easily used, and when the teacher 
understands that they are only suggestive and not 
final, they are very valuable. 
In giving group tests three difficulties must be 
avoided. (1) Every child must work under standard 
conditions. These demand that no distraction be 
allowed. No person should enter or leave the room. 
No questions should be allowed. Plenty of pencils, 
well sharpened, should be at hand. No child should 
be required to work at a rough or shaky desk or in a 
cramped or strained position. (2) The chances of 
copying during the test should be eliminated. If 
children sit close together, some of them may copy 
from their neighbors. It is best to have a vacant seat 
between each two children. In many cases signals 
 
-P-A-G-E-171
TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 143 
of “attention”? and ‘‘stop” are not heeded. Only 
recently I observed a university student who succeeded 
in adding about five points to his score on each test 
by working during explanation periods. As has been 
mentioned earlier in this chapter, drills in carrying 
out orders of this kind are valuable. (3) Often per- 
sons succeed in getting tests previous to the time of 
examination. They are able to practice upon these, 
and, of course, they find little difficulty in making 
high scores. This is likely to happen in a place where 
tests are frequent and where competition runs high. 
We should never base a conclusion regarding general 
intelligence upon one test. The National Research 
Council tests are made in two parts for this purpose. 
In addition to the tests the general work of the child 
should always be considered in judging his ability. 
All those who make especially high or low scores, the 
upper and the lower quartiles of a group, should be re- 
tested a number of times. In fact, these make up our 
most important problem. They should be followed 
with care, and enough tests should be given them to 
establish their special standings. When a child is 
eventually found to be markedly superior, he must 
be given opportunity to advance more rapidly than his 
fellows, and, at the same time, he should be furnished 
with abundant material outside of the course of study 
upon which to exercise his full mentality. Numerous 
investigators have reported that the bright child is 
the most retarded in our school system. Terman has  
-P-A-G-E-172
  144 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
demonstrated that he usually keeps his relative place 
of superiority as he grows older and as a rule is normal 
socially, being neither a freak nor a snob when dealt 
with properly, but likely to become both when his 
superior ability is not taken into consideration by his 
parents and teachers. It is also well known that bright 
children have been injured by being reminded too 
often of their superiority. 
Those who are eventually classified in the lower 
quartile should be given encouragement. If possible, 
the reason for low scores should be ascertained. Some 
children make low scores in group tests because they 
have not been given proper training in reading. Even 
in arithmetic the ability of the child to read is funda- 
mental. A child in the fifth or sixth grade who is 
backward in reading is sure to test low in group in- 
telligence tests. However, he is also likely to be 
backward in all school work and in all probability in 
life work, so his group-test rating is well worth having. 
When he is a slow reader but of high intelligence his 
scores in the tests where no reading is involved, such 
as the ‘‘ key test’ in the National Intelligence Tests, 
usually show where the trouble lies. Such a child 
is in grave danger. He should be brought up in his 
reading by individual drills, otherwise his entire life 
may be influenced in a negative way. 
What Intelligence Tests Do Not Measure. — In- 
telligence tests, even when they are perfected, will not 
1 Mechanical and auditory tests excepted. 
 
-P-A-G-E-173
TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 145 
furnish a complete analysis of the possibilities of the 
person measured. There are a number of useful 
qualities of human nature outside of mere mental 
capacity. Consider the following : 
Tenacity. — Tenacity enabled the tortoise to beat 
the hare in the proverbial race. The human being 
who is without this, even if very bright, will be 
severely handicapped in life. One who is not so 
capable may surpass him in everything. Therefore, 
the child who forms the habit of working long and 
hard has something that is often almost as valuable 
as high intelligence. When the two go together, the 
individual is always superior. 
Physical Strength.— Many bright persons lack this 
valuable life factor, and many who are not so bright 
get along because of super-vitality. Health or vitality 
must be considered as separate from mental capacity. 
Social Environment. — A bright child may waste his 
capacity if he is constantly surrounded by an environ- 
ment that gives him the wrong point of view. If his 
relatives and friends are thieves, he may become a 
difficult problem for police officers. When his home 
atmosphere is narrow, from either the religious or the 
political side, his brightness often results in extreme 
narrowness. When he is kept away from books, good 
music, and fine works of art, it makes little difference 
how much capacity he may have, he will never de- 
velop a taste for these things. 
There is one fact that helps the intelligent person 
 
-P-A-G-E-174
  146 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
and works against the unintelligent. These three 
factors, while they are separate, are correlated with 
intelligence. The old statement, ‘To him that hath 
it shall be given,’ seems to apply here. However, 
when a child with medium intelligence can bring to his 
aid any or all of the other three factors that make for 
success, the outlook for him is a great deal brighter. 
Measuring Silent Reading.’ — After intelligence has 
been tested thoroughly, silent reading should be meas- 
ured. Its importance is second only to that of intel- 
ligence. In all other school work reading must be 
done. Speed and comprehension in silent reading 
are basic elements of school progress. Standardized 
tests in silent reading tell us whether or not the speed 
and comprehension of a child are normal for his age and 
grade. 
There are, at this writing, some forty or fifty stand- 
ardized tests of silent reading. A number of recent 
tests for the comprehension of paragraphs test com- 
prehension without considering speed. Such a meas- 
ure is valuable, for, sometimes, but not in the majority 
of cases, a slow reader stands high in comprehension. 
In a test where speed is involved his ability to compre- 
hend may not be demonstrated before time is called. 
Some tests in silent reading may be useful as a check. 
The process seems to consist of a number of special 
functions. A child may test low in one test and high 
1¥For description of special tests see Problem 6 at the end of this 
chapter.
-P-A-G-E-175
TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 147 
in another. It will not take much time to give and 
score three or four tests. With the information thus 
acquired the teacher should be able to teach more 
effectively than he did before measuring silent 
reading. 
Measuring the Fundamentals of Arithmetic. — As 
has been stated before, it is a mistake to spend time 
measuring arithmetic if one is limited to testing one 
subject. The time should be spent on tests designed 
to measure general intelligence first. Then, before 
arithmetic is tested, silent reading should be thoroughly 
tested. This gives the fundamental elements of edu- 
cation their proper emphasis. This statement is 
repeated because it is desirable to answer thoroughly 
those who contend that although arithmetic is not so 
important as some other subjects, it is better to test 
this than to test nothing. When there is time to give 
one type of test and no time for anything else, one 
would better use the time in testing elements that are 
more fundamental to life. 
However, it is important that arithmetic be tested 
with standardized tests. The so-called diagnostic 
test may be mentioned as one of the most valuable. 
This is designed to show whether or not a class is up 
to standard in all the elements of arithmetic including 
the various phases of fractions, decimals, several types 
of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
A child may be wholly lacking in some obscure though 
important phase of arithmetic. These tests indicate 
 
-P-A-G-E-176
  148 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
such a deficiency. When discovered, the child who 
exhibits this lack may be given individual assign- 
ments designed to overcome his weakness. 
Measuring Composition. — Scales for measuring 
composition seem to have wide use. One of each is 
all that is necessary fora room. These may be posted 
on the wall and the children taught to measure their 
own compositions. A child should know how his 
written English compares with a standard for his age 
and grade even when such a standard is tentative. 
History and Geography. — Although there are at 
present a few tests in these subjects, the vital elements 
have not been considered sufficiently to warrant much 
emphasis being placed upon standard performance in 
them. There is no doubt that there are from fifty 
to one hundred basic facts in American history that 
every child should know if properly taught, but there 
seems to be little agreement on this point at present. 
Although standardization in these subjects is desirable, 
no definite suggestions seem advisable here. 
Spelling. — The Ayres spelling scale is a valuable 
device. It should be posted upon the walls of every 
schoolroom and used daily. It contains only valu- 
able words and furnishes distribution standards for 
every age and grade. 
Writing. — Either the Ayres or the Thorndike writ- 
ing scale is sufficient. In teaching writing it is very 
worth while to know whether or not a child is up to 
standard. It is the custom in many schools to excuse
-P-A-G-E-177
  TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 149 
from writing practice those who reach seventy on the 
Ayres scale. The child may measure his own writing 
when such a scale is posted. 
Summary of a Plan for Measurement.—In all, 
about fifteen standardized tests have been suggested 
here. Of the hundreds that are now on the market 
those best suited to the purposes of a school must be 
selected after careful study and experience. The in- 
tention here is to outline a practical program for the 
teacher or principal who is in earnest about measure- 
ment but who has not had time to investigate the 
merits of all the tests on the market. In the future 
many tests will be developed but the basic principles 
are likely to change only gradually if at all. 
The teacher must not fail to keep in mind the ne- 
cessity of measuring in all the fields of his program. 
He must prevent judgments being formed from a par- 
tial view of the school. When only partial measure- 
ment is possible, he must be sure to keep in mind the 
order of importance of subjects. Writing, for ex- 
ample, is a valuable subject, but its measurement is 
not nearly so necessary as is the frequent testing of 
silent reading. 
STANDARDS 
What Is a Standard ? — Standards, presumably, are 
ideals for an age or grade. They are supposed to be 
based upon the work of normal children working under 
normal conditions. However, many standards now
-P-A-G-E-178
  150 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
advocated are merely averages made by pupils of all 
sorts under varying conditions taught by teachers of 
different ability. 
For What Standards Should the Teacher Work? — 
In intelligence there is no standard. This is supposed 
to be a factor that changes very slowly and at most 
only slightly with education. In silent reading, as long 
as practice seems to bring improvement, the teacher 
is justified in trying to reach the ideal. The function 
is so important that one could not read with too much 
speed and comprehension. In arithmetic there seems 
to be little justification for some of the speed standards. 
A child who can come within fifty per cent of them 
will not suffer on account of his slowness. Accuracy, 
however, is paramount here. We are justified in doing 
everything we can to bring about ideal accuracy. In 
composition our present standards are, undoubtedly, 
low. The teacher should work to bring about com- 
positions that are superior to present standards. In 
spelling, the Ayres list of one thousand words, with 
some exceptions in the last columns, should be learned 
by the end of the sixth grade. When this is accom- 
plished, drill in spelling may be omitted. In writing 
Dr. Leonard V. Koos has demonstrated that no oc- 
cupation demands a score higher than sixty on the 
Ayres scale. His study has indicated that children 
who have reached seventy should be excused from prac- 
tice. Some children attain this in the third grade. 
The futility of trying to learn to write better than
-P-A-G-E-179
“TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 151 
well enough is obvious when there are so many more 
important things to accomplish. 
Standardize through Distributions.— Many teachers 
do not know when a group of children is normal. 
How many should be at standard, how many above 
standard, and how many below standard? With 
most scales a distribution is given. In it is indicated 
just how many should reach the various points on 
the scale if all conditions are normal. It is the task 
of the teacher to see that his class is as near a normal 
distribution as possible or even above in some subjects 
before the end of the year. A normal distribution 
is brought about by concentrating upon those children 
who are below standard and by allowing those who are 
above to work on some other subject in which they 
are not up to standard. In case a child is above stand- 
ard in all subjects, he may be advanced a grade or 
given extra work of a useful nature. Since reading 
is so important it may be well for such a child to read 
good books rather than take drills in arithmetic or 
writing when he has reached acceptable standards in 
these two subjects. 
Errors To BE AvompED 
In every new movement progress is marked by the 
overcoming of errors. The standardization movement 
is no exception. Numerous difficulties must be over- 
come, faulty practices must be eliminated, and pro- 
grams for successful work must be developed. The 
   
-P-A-G-E-180
  152 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
teacher should also be given information which will 
prevent his being imposed upon by faulty or inadequate 
testing. Some of these points are treated in the 
following paragraphs. 
What Standardized Tests Do Not Measure. — In 
using standardized tests to improve teaching we must 
be careful to use them effectively and constructively. 
Tf, after testing, it is assumed that we have measured 
something we have not, measurement will cause more 
trouble than its advantages warrant. In the past 
the following difficulties have been encountered and 
all who intelligently measure avoid them now: 
1. Average Work Is Not Standard. —'The ordinary 
“standard ” is usually mean or average performance. 
When a pupil has been measured by such a standard 
we know how he compares with the average pupil. 
However, we do not know whether or not he is doing 
as well as should be expected. 
It may be that the average class does not do so well 
as it should. This is usually the case in silent reading. 
In the future, classes are going to do much better 
than present standards require in this subject. 
On the other hand, several years of experience in 
trying to bring about improvement in the fundamen- 
tals of arithmetic has been convincing that some of the 
speed standards are too high for some children. Care- 
ful evaluation seems to indicate that the speed asked 
for in these standards is entirely unnecessary. For 
life use, half this speed may be sufficient. Since many
-P-A-G-E-181
  TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 153 
persons assume that the “standards ”’ furnished with 
tests tell us whether or not a class is performing as it 
should, the teacher should not deceive himself or allow 
others to impose upon him with this idea. A school 
should make a tentative decision as to what its stand- 
ards are to be and be willing to change this standard 
when new facts indicate that it is too high or too 
low. 
2. When a Class Is Measured by One Test, the Work 
of the Teacher Has Not Been Measured. — For ex- 
ample, a test in silent reading was given in two differ- 
ent rooms. The person who gave the test went about 
proclaiming that Miss X was a better teacher than 
Miss Y. He knew, he said, for he “had the facts.” 
But Miss X may not have been responsible for 
the high scores in her room. Several other factors 
may have been the cause. (1) She may have been 
teaching children of superior intelligence. (2) Her 
curriculum may have required more silent reading 
than that of Miss Y. (8) The teachers who taught 
the class in preceding years may deserve the credit 
given Miss X. 
In any attempt to compare the results of the work 
of two teachers it would be necessary to: (1) ascer- 
tain as nearly as possible the intelligence of their 
classes; (2) give two tests in each room at least 
three months apart; and (3) then keep in mind that 
the difference in the scores may give a partial indica- 
tion of the difference in the work of the two teachers
-P-A-G-E-182
  154 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
in the subject measured, provided, of course, that 
the intelligence of each class is practically the same. 
Even after this is done final judgment must be based 
upon a large number of other factors. There is no 
doubt that proper measurement can be a valuable 
aid in judging the work of teachers, but the process 
is not at all a simple one. 
SumMARy IN SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE 
1. First, keep in mind the fact that the superior 
teachers questioned by the writer were in sympathy 
with proper educational measurement. 
2. It will be worth while for the teacher to inform 
himself upon this subject. So much has been written 
and said about testing and measuring that the teacher 
who would grow should read books and when possible 
take courses that will enlighten him on progress in this 
field. 
3. Keep in mind the program for measuring. One- 
sided or partial measurement may cause you to over- 
emphasize unimportant subjects to the neglect of those 
that are important. 
4. Do not forget that the so-called “ standard” 
in a standardized test may not be a goal for all the 
children of your class to work toward. It may be 
that you do not want any of them to attain such a stand- 
ard, and in any case, the principle of standardization 
implies that the records of the children become dis- 
tributed above and below a standard. Individual differ-
-P-A-G-E-183
TEACHER AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 155 
ences in original nature necessitate distribution stand- 
ards rather than fixed goals for every one.

CHAPTER VII 
SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 
APPLYING PRINCIPLES 
THE measurement movement has had a large in- 
fluence aside from the making and giving of standard- 
ized tests. It has affected the procedure of teachers 
in their everyday work. Formerly the progress of a 
class was judged largely by intuition and sagacity. 
Now many teachers have learned that, even when 
scientifically constructed standardized tests are not 
available, the principles upon which they are based 
may be employed in making and giving common class- 
room tests and examinations. The new situation 
has developed as follows : 
1. Teachers have always given tests and examina- 
tions with more or less frequency, but the type of tests 
and the methods of scoring have for some time been un- 
der suspicion. It has been demonstrated that the best 
of teachers differ widely: (a) in the value of the ques- 
tions they have asked in their examinations; (6) in 
methods of giving tests, that is, in the conditions under 
which the children labored; and (c) in methods of 
157 
 
-P-A-G-E-186
  158 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
scoring. The same paper in arithmetic has been scored 
on the per-cent basis all the way from ten to above 
ninety by the mathematics teachers in representative 
high schools of the Middle West. Under the obser- 
vation of the writer the same teacher has given dupli- 
cate papers widely different grades when they were 
handed in a month apart. 
2. Frequent informal tests are a necessity in good 
teaching. Some of the most successful teachers ob- 
served in this study report that they find it advanta- 
geous to have the children do written work of some 
kind almost daily. Such exercises train children to 
express themselves accurately and briefly. They as- 
sure training for every one, while in oral recitations, 
even in the best of classes, a number of children usually 
fail to take part. 
3. Scientific measurement will be established in the 
largest sense when, in addition to the tests and measures 
that are now printed and sold, the teacher learns to . 
make use of the basic ideas of scientific testing in his 
everyday measures of the progress of his classes. 
4. Three principles that are applicable to every- 
day testing are: 
(1) Tests must be devised with greater care in 
order to make sure that cardinal issues rather than 
illustrative or transitory factors are measured. 
(2) The teacher should plan his tests in a general 
way at the beginning of the term when he plans the 
units of subject matter that are to be covered. In the
-P-A-G-E-187
  PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 159 
end both time and energy will be conserved by doing 
most of the work on a test before it is given. 
(3) Scoring can be made more accurate and uni- 
form by making a careful study of the material and 
assigning values before the test is given. This pro- 
cedure will make the examination more accurate. 
When the children understand something about the 
significance and values of the different phases of a test, 
it will give a more accurate picture of their abilities, 
for it is not infrequent that failure is merely the result 
of misunderstanding on the part of the child. He may 
not understand the question or he may not realize its 
importance. 
In group tests there are usually a few children who 
make low scores merely because they did not do their 
best. A well-known educator recently remarked that 
he had taken an intelligence test with a group of stu- 
dents and that he deliberately chose to save himself 
for a piece of work he had planned to do later in the 
day. This adult was justified in focusing his energy 
in one place rather than in the other. Children whose 
interests in school work are often artificial are also 
likely to do the same thing. When the children are 
totally unaware of the relative importance of differ- 
ent elements in a test a large number are sure to make 
incorrect emphasis. 
Some standard method of giving everyday marks 
and of scoring ordinary examinations will eventually 
be developed, and in the meantime the teacher who
-P-A-G-E-188
    160 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
tries to apply scientific principles in making everyday 
estimates of the work of his classes is likely to make 
progress and derive benefits from such activity. 
Some of the practical possibilities of this work are 
discussed and illustrated here. Once the idea is es- 
tablished there is no limit to the amount of work of 
this type that may be devised by a teacher with ini- 
tiative. 
DiaGnosis 
The Importance of Diagnosis. —If the teacher is 
to secure results he must first understand the condition 
of the learner. The learner should be studied before 
tasks are assigned to him, and as he progresses, his con- 
dition should be the basis for further assignments. 
Educational psychology makes this procedure an es- 
sential to teaching for results. Its importance need 
not be dwelt upon further here. 
Methods of Diagnosis. — In diagnosis the teacher 
tries to discover what the individual knows, how he 
learns, his rate of learning, his secondary reactions, 
and anything in his life inside and out of school that 
will help in deciding just what should be done to 
improve him. Diagnosis for the purpose of getting 
results in teaching is much more specific than the old 
dictum ‘‘ study the child.” 
After the teacher has found what he wishes to know 
about the learner he prescribes in somewhat the same 
way as does the physician for a patient. Teaching 
 
-P-A-G-E-189
  PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 161 
becomes truly professional when done in this way. 
Specific diagnosis in teaching the different school sub- 
jects may be made understandable by taking a number 
of classroom illustrations. 
Diagnosis in Arithmetic. —In each grade it is es- 
sential that the teacher first ascertain how well the 
children have been prepared for the course he is to 
teach. [Illustrations from several grades will indicate 
the process of diagnosis. 
Second-Grade Illustration. —In this grade the 
teacher taken for illustration had as her course of study 
the multiplication tables to the fives, addition and 
subtraction combinations to twenty, beginning addi- 
tion and subtraction with numbers of more than one 
digit, the introduction of borrowing and carrying, and 
concrete work in money, weights, and measures. 
She began the work by giving a series of tests. These 
were sometimes given in blackboard work and some- 
times in seat work. The problems in these tests were 
somewhat like the following : 
ComBINaTIONsS TO TWENTY 
1987543254368921765 
0436578997542368109 
These combinations and all the others possible up 
to twenty were printed upon flash cards. Each child 
was tested until the teacher knew how much of the 
material he knew before it was presented in the les- 
sons. She considered that there is no necessity for 
 
-P-A-G-E-190
  162 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
drilling a child on something he knows. Following 
this, drill was given to each child in accordance with 
his needs. 
After the preliminary work, in which it was found 
that several children already knew all the combina- 
tions quite well, specific drill was given in order to find 
the learning rates of the different individuals. Here 
it was found that one child needed ten repetitions to 
learn a combination which was learned by another in 
three. The latter also remembered about twice as 
well as the former. Every child was carefully studied 
from this standpoint. Thus, the drills were organized 
to purpose. They were much more than mere repe- 
tition. The teacher had a specific diagnostic interest 
in observing the efforts of the children. The results 
revealed that such diagnosis was worth all the time 
it took. 
In learning the tables and in the other work a simi- 
lar program was followed. 
Fifth-Grade Illustration. — Here the teacher had for 
her course a review of long division and the beginning 
of fractions. At the first of the term a thorough study 
was made of the state of mind of the pupils relative 
to arithmetic. Tests in addition, division, multipli- 
cation, and subtraction were given. Numerous prob- 
lems involving some reasoning were also provided 
in these tests. Finally, tests in fractions were given 
before the regular teaching of fractions was begun. 
A very wide range of ability and varying degrees of
-P-A-G-E-191
  PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 163 
preparation were found. One boy who had practi- 
cally covered the work was discovered. This discovery 
made it possible for him to be given work that led to 
his advancement to the next grade within two weeks. 
He had come in from another school and had been 
classified improperly. Another boy soon revealed 
that he had never learned the multiplication tables. 
He was put to work learning them at home. He ac- 
complished his task in a short time. No apparent 
reason was discovered for his lack of knowledge, for 
he amply demonstrated his ability to master such work. 
Following three weeks of testing the teacher knew 
quite well what her problems with the different indi- 
viduals were. 
Diagnosis in Reading. — It is very essential to know 
the rate and comprehension of each child in reading 
the ordinary subject matter of the grade. This is 
often discovered by taking several books, such as a 
geography, a history, and a reader, selecting suitable 
places in them for typical materiais, and then allowing 
the class five minutes to read as much as possible. 
After reading, the books should be closed and the 
teacher may find out the comprehension by asking from 
five to ten questions covering the vital factors. 
After calculating the number of lines read by each 
child in five minutes, together with his per cent of com- 
prehension, which is revealed in his answers to the 
questions, the teacher has a diagnosis of his reading 
rate and comprehension in relation to that of the class.
-P-A-G-E-192
    164 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
When such a diagnosis has been made in three subjects 
and at three different times for each subject, the rate 
and comprehension should be revealed quite clearly. 
It is usually found that the rate of each individual is 
fairly regular, but the comprehension may take a sudden 
fall or rise according to the material. If the teacher 
persists for the number of trials suggested, a fairly 
accurate diagnosis is possible. 
Such work is not difficult. It has been found in- 
teresting to children, and the scheme suggested below 
is not burdensome to the teacher. If a few definite 
questions on the matter read are asked, the task is 
much more simple than if the children are asked to 
reproduce what they read. In the latter case, the 
ability to evaluate comes in, and the different factors 
of interest will cause every paper to be different. Read- 
ing these papers becomes a burdensome task. The 
answers to the few definite questions measure the com- 
prehension just as well and relieve the teacher from a 
great deal of work. 
Illustration of a Diagnostic Test in Reading. — 
Page 24 of the Second Book of Tarr and MeMurry’s 
New Geographies is used here for illustration of the 
method. This is a solid page (no pictures), and it con- 
tains materials that furnish a splendid test. 
The teacher should choose several such pages for 
test purposes. The material should be considered 
with great care and a number of questions prepared. 
These should cover the page in a way to bring out the
-P-A-G-E-193
PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 165 
thinking as well as the mechanical memory of the child 
who reads. Comprehension and memory are combined 
here because we test not only the ability to understand 
but also the ability to keep in mind long enough to 
discuss intelligently. Only immediate memory is to 
be tested, however. 
The following questions were used by one teacher 
in connection with the page in geography given here. 
These are excellent, but it might have been possible 
to improve three or four of them. 
1. Why didn’t the North American Indians build homes? 
2. Why did the Aztecs build homes and become more 
civilized than the other Indians? 
3. What reasons besides the lack of homes kept the 
Indians from becoming civilized?

The Results of the Above Test. — In this test each 
child was tested individually. He was taken aside, 
told to read the page between the two marks as rapidly 
as possible, but to try to remember what he read be- 
cause he would be asked some questions about it. The 
importance of both speed and accuracy was dwelt 
upon. However, a number of tests had already been 
given to this class and the children understood the 
need for both speed and accuracy. The teacher recorded 
the time taken to read the page. After the reading 
the twenty questions listed above were asked. 
The median (middle score) for thirty-seven children 
in this fifth grade was: time, 5 minutes 20 seconds; 
number of questions answered correctly, 6. 
Individual variations were great, however, and it 
was to find the rate and comprehension of each pupil 
as compared to that of the class that this test was given. 
Let us consider one case, for illustration. A boy who 
had been giving considerable trouble in regular work 
took 9 minutes 20 seconds or almost twice the time of 
the median. His comprehension, however, made up 
for his slowness. He answered 16 of the questions 
correctly, and his answers showed such high quality 
of thought that the teacher changed her opinion of
-P-A-G-E-195
  PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 167 
him. She had been ready to send him to a lower class. 
This is an unusual case, however, for slow readers as a 
rule do not comprehend better than rapid readers.’ 
Another child in this same grade took 6 minutes 
50 seconds or somewhat more than the median. His 
comprehension was also lower. He was able to answer 
only three of the questions correctly. 
Test Adequately before Coming to a Conclusion. — 
One test like the above will not furnish sufficient in- 
formation upon which to base a conclusion. There 
may be reasons why a child may fail to do his regular 
work at the time he is tested. In the test given for 
illustration one boy who was known to be a bright 
student made a score of only three in comprehension. 
This was half as high as the median. Other tests re- 
vealed that he could do better. Upon being questioned 
he admitted that during the test his mind was upon 
a game that was to be played that evening. The cure 
for difficulties of this sort is more testing. From six 
to nine tests of this nature will establish the relative 
speed and comprehension of the children of any class. 
The relative speed and comprehension of any child 
varies very little from day to day or with changing 
materials. By relative is meant the ability of a child 
as compared to that of the rest of the class. The ab- 
solute speed and comprehension varies greatly with 
the material to be read, but the materials seem to af-

  168 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
fect different children in a similar way. If one child 
is retarded by difficult material, so are the majority 
of the class, although there are exceptions. 
Suggestion for the Use of. Results. — First of all, 
knowledge of special capacity or deficiency in reading 
rate and comprehension gives the teacher opportunity 
to adjust school work to individuals. If a child is re- 
markable in his ability to read both rapidly and intelli- 
gently, his possibilities for acceleration are great, for 
this ability is fundamental to school progress. With 
such knowledge the teacher may begin to stimulate 
this child to go ahead. On the other hand, when the 
teacher discovers that a very slow reader has superior 
comprehension, as was the case with the boy who had 
good comprehension but was very slow, an entirely 
different procedure should follow. Here an intelligent 
child might have been injured because he lacked the 
mechanical ability necessary to speed in reading. Such 
a discovery usually leads to further study of the special 
case. It was finally discovered that this boy had lacked 
vitality and had been slow in the three lower grades. 
He had avoided practice whenever he could. The 
result was evident, and although his vitality had in- 
creased considerably he was not able to read as rapidly 
as those who had undergone thorough training. 
Secondly, in daily assignments the teacher with 
full knowledge of each child’s reading ability in the 
texts that are in-everyday use will know how much 
material to assign as well as what to expect of the dif-
-P-A-G-E-197
PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 169 
ferent individuals. If it takes the median pupil in a 
class 5 minutes 20 seconds to read and select the im- 
portant parts from a page in the geography, how many 
pages should be assigned for fifteen minutes of study? 
If the teacher does not know the rate of reading, how 
can he decide what length of assignment to make? 
It has been said that he soon discovers the rate and 
comprehension of each child by contact in teaching. 
A number of teachers have been questioned upon this 
point. It was found that they were woefully inade- 
quate in their estimates. In fact, it is safe to conclude 
that ordinary teaching does not furnish a teacher with 
sufficient data upon this point. Numerous recitations 
were observed where the assignments were so long 
that the children could not read the lesson without 
taking time to study it. In one case it was found that 
the teacher could not read his assignment in the time 
required of the class. In just as many and perhaps 
in more instances teachers have assigned materials 
that were not adequate for even the slow readers. 
Thirdly, when the comprehension of the class is 
known, the teacher is able to work with different in- 
dividuals to better purpose in the discussion. When 
a child is called upon, the knowledge that he ordinarily 
comprehends only about ten per cent of the material 
he reads is worth having. 
Probably the most valuable result here is the dis- 
covery that the average child fails to understand most 
of the subject matter he reads. A teacher who has 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
170 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
not made a study of reading comprehension is likely 
to expect more than is just. Adults are often defi- 
cient in comprehension, and they are frequently un- 
aware of this defect. Thus, when the superior teacher 
finds that the average pupil in his class does not know 
the simple elements of an assignment just after “ study- 
ing,” he does not feel that the class has not been work- 
ing. If he knows the rate of reading and the per cent 
of comprehension of the different children, he knows 
just about how well each one should have his lesson. 
In order to discuss assignments in a developmental 
way the teacher must first have some definite knowl- 
edge concerning reading abilities. 
Diagnosis in Geography and History. — These are 
content and thought subjects. In teaching a class 
the teacher should inform himself of the ability of the 
children to think; he should know the reading rate 
and comprehension of each child and, as a special fea- 
ture of teaching these subjects, he should know how 
much they have read, traveled, and come in contact 
with the material to be covered. In one fifth-grade 
class the Hawaiian Islands had been under discussion 
for several days when it was discovered that two of 
the children had lived in Honolulu for several years. 
In the upper grades and in the high school the out- 
side reading of some children may be very extensive. 
In one eighth-grade class in history it was found that 
one of the boys had read literally hundreds of histori- 
cal books. His father was a wide reader and had col-
-P-A-G-E-199
PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 171 
lected a good historical library. The boy had been 
especially interested in the books on history. It took 
a definite, organized effort to discover just how ex- 
tensive his reading had been, but after this the teacher 
was able to deal with him accordingly. In the same 
class there were a number of children who had done no 
independent reading in history. 
In testing reasoning ability the teacher should try 
to discover the state of development of the class in the 
important elements of historical and geographical 
thinking. More than ever before, the modern teacher 
is using history and geography to develop thinking and 
a social consciousness. A number of tests should be 
given to discover whether or not the children evaluate, 
compare, relate, take issue with false statements, and 
supplement the thought in the books they read by 
additional thinking of their own. 
Illustration of Test for Diagnosis of Thinking Ability 
in History.— The page used for illustration here is 
page 131 of Nida’s Dawn of American History in 
Europe. It offers some opportunity for thought, al- 
though better selections for testing purposes could be 
found. The one that follows is given for discussion 
here because it was tried extensively in one of the 
Seattle public schools. 
The following reasons for Alfred’s greatness were 
selected from the page cited. The children had pre- 
viously read the entire chapter. Then they were asked 
to read this page again, and with their books open so that 
   
-P-A-G-E-200
  172 THE IMPROVEMENT " TEACHING 
1 they might consult the materi 
to fill out the following: , they were then asked 
Put the number / after each of the best reasons for calling 
Alfred great, the number 2 after other reasons not so good, 
and a 0 after any statement that is not a reason for calling 
him great. 
1. He was a good Christian man in an age when so many 
were wicked. 
2. He was unselfish, for he lived only to serve his people. 
3. He was never cast down in defeat nor cruel to the 
enemy when he conquered. 
4. There arose during Alfred’s reign many powerful 
nobles. | 
5. The Saxon customs were cruel and barbarous. 
6. The nobles hated Alfred. 
7. The nobles would not obey the laws unless they 
chose to. 
8. Alfred was himself a great scholar in an age when 
nearly everybody was ignorant. 
9. He encouraged great scholars and men of learning to 
come over from the continent. 
10. Alfred is said to have been the most perfect char- 
acter in history. - 
After a test of this type has been given, children 
who fail completely should be questioned as to their 
answers. All degrees of ability to make judgments as 
simple as most of the above statements eall for will be 
found in fifth-, sixth-, and seventh-grade classes. Some 
of these statements demand keen analysis. A number 
of intelligent adults, after discussion, agreed that the 
number 1 should be placed attar statements 1, 2, 3, 8,
-P-A-G-E-201
  PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 173 
and 9; the number 2 after 10; and 0 after 4, 5, 6, and 
7. Statement 10 is in class 2 because a man may be 
said to be perfect without adequate reason. It de- 
pends upon who said it and why it was said. How- 
ever, if some one of importance did make such a state- 
ment, one could be safe in assuming that there must be 
some reason for it. Thus it makes a good statement 
of secondary importance. It is worth more than zero 
but is not as good as several others. The average 
child is likely to put it in class 1. A child who reasons 
well enough to put this statement in class 2 is remark- 
able. However, some children will do this. A 
child should learn to think as he reads. The average 
thoughtless reader would overlook the fact that Alfred 
was only said to have been the most perfect character. 
This is a type of slovenly reading that we wish to teach 
him to avoid. 
Statement 6 is sometimes put in class 2. A child 
who does this and gives as his reason statement 7 may 
be regarded as an excellent thinker. For if nobles 
who would not obey the laws unless they chose to, 
hated Alfred, he must have enforced the laws. The 
enforcement of laws is not a cardinal reason for a king's 
greatness, but is certainly a secondary factor. Some 
kings force only the poor to obey laws. When this 
test was submitted to high-school classes, a boy with 
a socialistic bias took the stand that 6 was cardinal. 
He reasoned that being hated by rich nobles who did 
not obey laws was the acme of glory. It may be taken
-P-A-G-E-202
    174 THE IMPROVEMENT oe TEACHING 
as a doubtful question, but it is important because it 
serves to call attention to the child whose power of 
analysis is better than the average. 
After five or six tests like the above have been given 
and the results studied, the teacher is able to explain 
historical causes and relations in a way that may be 
understood by the class. When half his class mark 
statements 5 and 7 as important reasons for calling 
Alfred great, and when they make similar judgments 
in other tests, he knows enough about them to adjust 
his explanations to their level. 
Teachers who do not diagnose in this way are prone 
to make two mistakes. First, they usually underrate 
the reasoning ability of a few children who are slow at 
mechanical work but good reasoners. Slow mechani- 
cal work is probably correlated with poor reasoning, 
but there are a few children who reason well but are 
slow in mechanics. Second, teachers are likely to “talk 
over the heads” of a majority of children. Children 
are not likely to be able to comprehend the thought 
factors of history and geography as well as they will 
after teaching of the modern type is more common. 
The Small Amount of Work in Diagnosis Should Not 
Cause the Teacher to Avoid It. — Sometimes teachers 
feel that diagnosis takes up energy and time that might 
have been devoted to “regular work.” Diagnosis 
is, of course, a central feature of good regular work, 
but some teachers have the idea that standing before 
a class and talking most of a period while a few ques- 
|
-P-A-G-E-203
ee ee Tee eee nT eae 
PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 175 
tions are asked of the children is the only type of work 
that may be termed “regular.” Advancing a few 
pages in the text is often regarded as another “ es- : 
sential.” When these two elements are lacking, it 
is difficult for many teachers to see that a class period 
has been spent wisely. 
The teacher must cease to harbor this idea of teach- 
ing and feel free to spend his time and energy in a 
way that will best promote the growth of his pupils. 
He should not be content to go through the traditional 
motions of instruction without making sure that what 
he is doing is having the proper effect. The time spent 
in diagnosis is far from being a diversion. It is very 
essential that time be spent in this way in order to 
insure results. This question would not be raised here 
if it had not been asked so frequently by teachers. 
There seems to be a fear, especially in city school sys- 
tems, that time not devoted to covering pages may be 
wasted. 
The amount of work in such diagnosis is no more 
than that involved in ordinary classroom exercises. 
In the end it will make all the work of the teacher much 
more pleasant and less difficult. After a few attempts, 
diagnosis becomes as natural as any other part of the 
program.

2. Make frequent written work a basic principle of 
your teaching practice. 
3. Devise tests in order to 
(1) Discover the child who has missed something 
important in his previous training. 
(2) Find out how much the children already know 
about the subject you are to introduce. 
(8) Discover learning rates, ability to read assign- 
ments, and the quality of thinking of the children in 
your classes. | 
4, Remember that time spent in diagnosis is not 
a diversion or digression from the proper use of teach- 
ing time. Keep in mind that this is even more es- 
sential than is the “ covering ” of the course of study. 
It is necessary to diagnose classes in order to teach a 
course of study properly.

SCIENTIFIC PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 
(Continued) 
SUGGESTIONS FOR PROCEDURE AFTER DIAGNOSIS 
Discover Difficulties Early in the Term. — With data 
at hand, after careful diagnosis, the teacher can early 
overcome the factors that are likely to give trouble. 
Too often we discover after the term is almost over that 
a bright child may be handicapped because he is a slow 
reader or because he has been out of school when the 
multiplication of fractions or some like topic was 
studied. When the teacher discovers the difficulty and 
tries to eliminate it early in the year, a great deal of 
trouble is avoided for both teacher and pupil. The 
teacher should use the knowledge he has discovered in 
his diagnosis to remove any handicaps under which he 
may find children working, and to emphasize and utilize 
their strong points. 
Prevent Failure and Assist in Acceleration. — One of 
the first uses of the results of diagnosis is to prevent’ 
failure and assist in legitimate acceleration. In some 
cities causes of retardation have been noted after it 
became a fact. If these causes are discovered early in 
178
-P-A-G-E-207
PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 179 
the term they can often be combated. Thus low 
vitality, bad home conditions, lack of coéperation on the 
part of parents, lack of preparation for the grade, inability 
to do the work, interests outside of the school, and similar 
causes may be overcome in a great many cases. There 
is only one time to realize fully upon efforts at pre- 
venting failure, and that is early in the term. Much 
may be accomplished if we begin in time. This is why 
diagnosis must precede all other work. 
In the same way small groups may be organized to 
cover in one term the essential elements of two terms’ 
work. This avoids the disturbance often brought about 
by traditional “ skipping.” Early in the work careful 
analysis is made of both preparation and learning 
capacity. Those who show that they have the attain- 
ments and the ability are organized into a group and 
given enough work for the two grades. There are no 
weak places in their development after such work, for 
they were discovered and organized early enough in the 
term to allow for proper training. The method of 
allowing, on rare occasions, bright children to “ skip” 
grades usually left such children without any knowl- 
edge of the vital elements of the work in the grade 
missed. 
Study Growth and Improvement. — When the 
teacher knows the state of development of each child 
in all the subjects he teaches, he has a basis for the 
observation of improvement. Without this knowledge, 
which only careful diagnosis can furnish, it is impossible  
-P-A-G-E-208
180 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
to ascertain whether or not improvement is being made. 
After all his work on learning, Thorndike concluded that 
one essential element for progress in practice is provision 
for the learner to see the results of his efforts. Thus, when 
instruction is built upon careful diagnosis, when each 
child may see for himself just what his progress from 
week to week is, and when the teacher may assure 
himself that a certain method is or is not bringing about 
improvement, the opportunity for effective work is 
created. The psychology of the situation may be 
expressed by saying that we must first know where we are 
tn order to see whether or not we are improving, while 
improvement demands that the results of practice be made 
apparent. 
Frequent Tests AND EXAMINATIONS 
When Should Tests and Examinations Be Given ? — 
Tests and examinations should start at the beginning 
of the term and be made a definite part of the work 
throughout. If they are to be emphasized at one time 
more than another, that time is during the first half 
of the year. There are two reasons for this. First, 
frequent tests serve to show whether or not progress is 
being made. This is the diagnostic use, and its value 
has been discussed. Second, when from the beginning 
classes learn to expect frequent tests, the type of work 
they do is sure to be better. There is nothing more 
discouraging to a student who does good work than to 
find that the teacher is able to make no distinction
-P-A-G-E-209
PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 181 
between himself and his less industrious neighbor, and 
there is nothing that will so surely lead a lazy child to 
become more lazy as teaching which permits him to 
go for long periods without being “checked up.” 
Therefore, we must give examinations early and late 
and as frequently as possible. 
Frequent Examinations That Do Not Overwork the 
Teacher. — Scientific procedure has made it possible 
to give frequent stimulating tests of high diagnostic 
value without overburdening the teacher. These tests 
may be of such short duration that they do not even 
interfere with the ordinary recitation. They are of 
three types. 
1. Completion Tests.—In the content subjects, 
such as geography, history, hygiene, and some parts 
of English, the completion test serves admirably. In 
making such a test the teacher arranges several sen- 
tences in which important words, those which give the 
data or the facts desired, are omitted. These may be 
read to the children, who supply the missing words. 
Such a test in American history is given below. 
Completion Test on the Life and Work of Abraham Lincoln + 
1. Lincoln was a great man because he:

2. He was born in the state of ——, spent most of his life 
in the state of , and died as a result of at about 
the age of ——. 
3. He was a (poor, rich) boy and went to school (a great 
deal, very little). 
4, He was educated mostly by ——. 
5. For his amusements he loved most (1) ——, (2) ——, 
(3) —. 
6. Several good books that tell of Lincoln are:   
  
This test covers a few important questions on Lincoln 
that had been answered in discussion and assignments 
made the day before. It illustrates a short, specific 
quiz that is not intended to be exhaustive. It is often 
worth while, when possible, to mimeograph such tests, 
but the teacher can use them successfully by reading 
the statements to the class while the children write the 
missing words or sentences upon their papers. 
2. Short Questions with Specific Answers. — Another 
type of test is made up of short questions that demand 
specific answers. These are useful in the emphasis of 
important elements of assignments and to check up 
children who may not be doing assigned reading. They 
may be used in any grade. The one given here was 
used in a university class in “ How to Study.” For 
preliminary work they had been assigned Foster’s 
Should Students Study. The students were numbered 
one and two.
-P-A-G-E-211
  PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 183 
Short Question and Specific Answer Test on the First Two 
Chapters of “Should Students Study” 
Two questions for number ones: 
1. What does Foster think is the attitude of the average 
student? 
2. Give the three reasons why college students should 
study, quoted from President Hyde’s speech. 
Two questions for number twos: 
1. In which place does Foster think students are more 
serious, the large state institutions or the private colleges? 
2. What did President Hyde say of the value of success 
in studies alone ? 
Here we have two questions for each group. In both 
cases an easy and a difficult question were asked. Those who 
could not answer the first question were doing very poor 
work, while those who could answer the second question had 
read carefully. 
3. True-False Tests and Those in Which Correct 
Words Are Underlined or Written Down. — The true- 
false test is not very useful, for the fact that questions 
may be answered by merely guessing. Those in which 
words are underlined or written down are better because 
four or five words may be given, one of which is correct. 
A True-False Test from a Lesson on Kansas

3. Most of the people live in large cities. True, false. 
4. Farming is the chief industry. True, false. 
5. A great deal of money is made from the gold mines 
there. True, false. 
6. Oil in large quantities is found there. True, false.

184 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
A Test in Which the Correct Words Are Underlined or 
Written 
1. Kansas is (larger than, smaller than, the same size as) 
Texas. 
2. The main crops in Kansas are (flax, apples, wheat, 
buckwheat, cotton, rubber, corn, oranges, and alfalfa). 
3. Most of the people live in (large cities, in the country, 
in small towns). 
4. The chief industry is (farming, manufacturing, fishing, 
commerce). 
5. (Coal, oil, gold, silver, lead, copper, and zinc) are 
mined in Kansas. 
In giving such tests as these the teacher may have 
them mimeographed or they may be read to the class 
and the answers written by the children. Most teachers 
will have to use the second method, and it serves ex- 
cellently. 
Suggestions on How and When to Grade Tests. — In 
some cases it has been found advantageous to have 
the children grade their own papers immediately after 
the test is finished. The teacher should answer the 
questions, and a system of grading that is easy to 
execute should be devised. There are several ad- 
vantages in having the class grade the papers imme- 
diately. 
First, the teacher is saved a great deal of work. This 
is an essential element of good teaching. Every time a 
teacher wastes his energy doing things that may with 
profit be done by the children he is working against both
-P-A-G-E-213
  PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 185 
his usefulness and happiness. The teacher should look 
over the papers afterwards and not accept the marks of 
the children without his own check. 
Second, it is very worth while for the class to hear the 
answers to the questions, or the correct statements, 
while interest is high. The individual sees his success 
or failure immediately after performance. 
Third, opportunity is furnished the teacher to em- 
phasize the factors he deems important. {He can 
show a child the difference between good and poor 
evaluation at the time the work is done.? 
Further Suggestions regarding Frequent Tests and 
Examinations. — First it should be repeated that the 
most effective way of securing results in teaching is to 
let the child know that his work is to be tested fre- 
quently for the double purpose of making sure that he is 
working and to give him and his teacher opportunity 
to see how he is progressing. It has been found that the 
self-respect of the teacher is increased by knowing at all 
times just how all the children are progressing. There 
is nothing more wearing than trying to teach when the 
teacher is not sure whether or not the children are 
studying. This makes the whole process somewhat 
like groping in the dark. The ability to make good 
1Care must be taken to avoid allowing one child to pass upon the 
work of another. The teacher should furnish the answers. Also 
the time spent in going over the papers should not be excessive. Five 
minutes should be a maximum. The central idea here should be the 
value received by the children when their work is checked immediately 
after performance.
-P-A-G-E-214
  186 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
tests of the three types suggested will increase with 
practice. The tendency to use them and gain from 
such use also grows with practice. Probably the chief 
difficulty is the overcoming of inertia. Teachers are 
likely to admit that such tests may be very useful, but, 
somehow, they never seem to make use of them. Then 
there is a common practice of short-lived enthusiasm, 
that is, a good beginning may be made, following which 
interest soon lapses. 
Surraste Monraty, Term, or “County” Ex- 
AMINATIONS 
The Modern Attitude towards Examinations. — 
Examinations in subject matter which merely serve as 
a test to ascertain whether or not an individual should 
be promoted or allowed to enter high school or college 
are fast being done away with. Numerous investiga- 
tions have showed that honest, intelligent examiners 
differ widely in the grades they assign to the same paper. 
On the same paper in Arithmetic, Starch! found that 
teachers in the best high schools of America placed 
marks ranging from ten to ninety per cent. Other 
investigations have furnished similar results. 
However, there are many places — counties in which 
adequate supervision is impossible may be listed here — 
where an examination of some sort seems necessary in 
order to tell whether or not a child has made a reason-

able amount of progress the first eight years of study. 
The fact that patrons and school boards in small 
districts often bring pressure to bear upon the teacher 
when promotion time comes, as well as the fact that we 
are forced to employ many teachers with low stand- 
ards, makes it necessary to check the work in some 
official way. The county examination has been the 
method most frequently used for this purpose. 
The chief difficulty with this examination is the fact 
that the questions are sometimes ridiculous and unfair. 
The worst result is that poor questions, those which ask 
for useless abilities and facts, lead to emphasis being 
placed upon results of the wrong type. When these 
examinations ask for useful knowledge and demand an 
adequate proportion of thinking, little can be said in 
opposition to them. However, a reform of this type 
must proceed slowly. The average rural school teacher 
is not informed on educational values. A good func- 
tional examination would result in unjust failures where 
children were not to blame for the kind of training they 
had had. A campaign of education is first necessary. 
For this reason examinations of the modern type as con- 
trasted with typical old-style examinations are given for 
illustration here. State and county superintendents are 
beginning to change to the better type of examination. 
A practice that still stands in the way of progress in 
many places is that of asking a teacher in a university 
or higher institution to make out the questions in his 
subject. Too often such a person knows little about
-P-A-G-E-216
  188 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
modern ideas in pedagogy. He is merely expert in his 
subject. The result is an examination which demands 
a great deal of knowledge, but unfortunately it is often 
of interest to specialists only. The superintendents 
could make out much better questions, and, at any rate, 
if another is asked to do this work, he should be qualified 
in education as well as in a special subject. In fact, 
for county examinations, any educator (one with 
educational training) knows enough about the common 
branches to make out suitable questions for eighth-grade 
graduates. 
Types of Questions Illustrating Modern Examina- 
tions. — 
History of the United States 
A good examination in one question was stated some- 
what as follows: 
Discuss what you regard as the ten most important events 
in American history. Make a clear statement describing 
each event. Give the facts that lead up to it, and show by 
describing events that follow why the one you select is 
important. 
This examination might be given to eighth-grade, 
high-school, or college students, and answers in ac- 
cordance with their training made the basis for grading. 
Its advantages are: (1) It allows opportunity for the 
individual who is well prepared to select from his store 
of knowledge, (2) prevents accidental high or low scores, 
(8) requires both thought and facts, (4) demands

initiative. The one who grades such a test has a full 
opportunity to see the mental power of the child who 
writes the paper. One defect of this examination is 
that it is difficult to score accurately. Also children 
who have not been trained to select and evaluate may 
fail on this question.

examination in English is that it tests the child in the 
use of his English.. Nothing is asked that does not 
have common use in written or spoken English. There 
are no catch questions. The subject is covered exten- 
sively enough to test the child’s knowledge and ability 
to use English. 
Hygiene 
1. Name five health habits and state just how each is to 
be performed. For example, one health habit is brushing 
the teeth. If you name this one, tell what you know about 
how and when to brush the teeth. Treat four others in a 
similar way. 
2. What foods are healthful for a growing child? What 
foods are not healthful? Why? 
8. What should one do in order to take proper care of 
the stomach? Why? 
4. How may we take proper care of the lungs? Why 
should we do as you suggest? 
5. Discuss proper care of the feet, their importance, foot 
troubles, and their causes, and proper treatment. 
6. What should one do if one’s clothing catches fire? 
7. How would you treat scalds and burns? cuts? bruises? 
Here we have simple questions which depend upon a 
certain amount of knowledge of anatomy and physi- 
ology, but this knowledge is of the useful variety. 
Disease is mentioned only as something to prevent. 
Bodily organs are to be cared for. 
In all the questions given above to illustrate proper 
general examinations for the term, or for county, or 
state purposes, some basic principles and precepts
-P-A-G-E-219
  / 
PRINCIPLES IN EVERYDAY TESTING 191 
have been kept in mind. These may be stated briefly 
as follows : 
1. Make it possible for every one who has made 
careful preparation to do something. This is very 
important when the examination is the only criterion 
for promotion or for admission to high school. Many 
children who well deserve to pass often fail because the 
questions did not allow them to get a start. In every 
case, those who are poorly prepared and those who are 
content to do slovenly work will be detected by ques- 
tions of the right sort. 
2. Test for useful knowledge. This will vindicate 
the modern teacher. Examinations should not deter 
us in demanding useful knowledge but should become a 
stimulus for progress. Standards in grading papers 
should at first be lower than they will need to be later 
on. This will prevent worthy children from failing 
because they were taught by teachers who had not been 
trained in educational values. 
8. Test for both facts and thinking, but allow the 
individual some opportunity to choose among different 
important facts. The modern world demands that one 
know facts. But it is not important that he be in- 
formed upon every peculiar topic that may come to 
the mind of a specialist. 
The above illustrative examination questions are 
given to indicate a possible transition from the old 
encyclopedia type of examination. In the near future 
we will undoubtedly have reliable standardized ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  192 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
aminations that will test the ability of the child to 
enter high school, but until that time comes it will be 
worth while to employ educational principles in the 
construction of examinations as they are now given. 
SUMMARY IN SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE 
1. Discover early in the term children who may have 
trouble later on. Prevent the occurrence of this 
trouble. 
2. Use scientific principles in making out your every- 
day tests. 
3. Let those who are doing good work have frequent 
opportunities to score. 
4. Use the three types of tests suggested in this 
chapter in making your examinations more effective 
as well as easier to grade. 
5. Be sure to devise ways of giving frequent tests 
and at the same time make less work for yourself. 
Consider this illustration. A teacher reported that it 
took him five hours to grade a set of test papers. After 
planning his tests as suggested in this chapter he re- 
ported that he gave better tests, covered more ground, 
and needed only twenty minutes to grade a set of papers. 
6. Emphasize valuable information in your tests. 
Avoid questions that call for peculiar or unnecessary 
knowledge.

  CHAPTER Ix 
SOME FUNDAMENTALS OF CLASSROOM PRACTICE 
Four FUNDAMENTALS 
Tr is well to have an understanding in regard to what 
is fundamental as a part of the improvement of any 
of the phases of teaching. A teacher who does not 
recognize the fundamentals cannot hope to become 
successful merely by using modern methods, for 
modern teaching presupposes a mastery of the com- 
mon elements of teaching. 
At present the educational world is going through a 
critical period. We must take special pains to es- 
tablish a fundamental procedure upon which to base 
our modern developments. It must be demonstrated 
that the modern school is doing thorough work in the 
three R’s, that projects go hand in hand with effective 
drill in the fundamentals of arithmetic, and that a 
definite course of study is given due consideration. In 
addition the fundamental elements of the teaching pro- 
cess must be in evidence in all school work. The fun- 
damentals of teaching as emphasized in the practice 
of superior teachers are: 
1. Success in everyday classroom teaching, both in 
recitations and individual instruction.

that they become assets rather than liabilities. 
Tue Part PLayepD By EverypAY CLASSROOM 
TEACHING 
All the Best Teachers Succeed Here. — Mastery 
of technique in the classroom management of groups 
or individuals stands at the head of the list of ele- 
ments of successful teaching. In visiting the classes 
of teachers who have become well known throughout 
the country for community work, club work, the de- 
velopment of high interest in special subjects, or for 
other reasons, it was usually discovered that these 
teachers were masters in daily classroom practice. 
A Plan for Improving Daily Classroom Practice. — 
The teacher is likely to realize his desire to improve 
classroom practice in the measure that he has some 
definite scheme with which he lives and works. The 
following suggestions have been compiled after ob- 
serving and noting the central features in the class- 
room work of superior teachers.’ 
1. Make the Classroom a Sacred Place. — This is the 
place where the teacher and the children meet for the 
1 This is not intended to be a complete analysis, but a plan for im- 
proving average classroom practice.
-P-A-G-E-226
196 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
high purpose of making progress. It should be the 
aim of every school to make good teaching a central 
feature, and the work of the teacher during class 
periods should be guarded and protected from any 
possible intrusion. Children should be taught that 
classroom activities are more important than other 
school activities. The teacher should feel justified in 
objecting to intrusion. Principals and superintend- 
ents should not forget this. In numerous schools 
there are hundreds of useless interruptions. Little 
can be accomplished until this point has been won. 
2. Each Member of a Class Should Be a Special 
Problem for Study. — With rapid and slow children, 
bright and dull, talkative and silent, lazy and ener- 
getic, and numerous other types before him, the 
teacher is faced by a problem upon which he can 
work and improve his methods as long as he re- 
mains in the profession. How is it possible to provide 
suitable tasks for every one, to see that each works 
upon this suitable task in the proper way; that each 
child is interested and understands as far as possible 
why he is asked to work? These and a number of 
similar questions make the classroom a place where | 
much or little may be accomplished.   Tabulated observations of over five hundred recita- — 
tions show that in the average class of thirty-five, 
1It is not necessary for every child to recite every day or for all to 
do the same amount of talking. Active participation may be shown 
by responsive listening, intelligent questions, or by individual work. | 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
    
FUNDAMENTALS OF CLASSROOM PRACTICE 197 
sia children do nine-tenths of the reciting. Ten members 
of a class of this size form the habit of never reciting 
unless called upon, and pay little attention while 
others are reciting.’ 
With such facts in mind the teacher should plan 
ways of teaching that will reach all the members of a 
class. He must avoid working too long with the slow 
child. The talkative child must not be allowed to take 
up too much time. Each class presents a different 
problem. Ingenuity and perseverance on the part of 
the teacher can change the situation described in the 
preceding paragraph. It has been done by a large 
number of teachers. 
3. The Teacher Should Not Talk Too Much. — Care 
must be taken to avoid making the recitation period 
merely one of exercise for the teacher. Of the two 
thousand or more teachers observed in this study very 
few had overcome the tendency to talk too much. 
Most progressive teachers candidly admit this fault 
and strive to overcome it. In fact, this admission was 
usually a distinguishing mark. One teacher who had © 
reached a high state of perfection in controlling her 
own impulses to talk too much was observed fre- 
quently for several years. The results of her work 
were exceptionally good. 
4. Emphasize Important Issues.— One successful 
1 These observations were made in the schools of Seattle, Washing- 
ton, where there is probably more initiative than in the average school. 
They are, therefore, not overdrawn.
-P-A-G-E-228
198 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
superintendent advised his teachers on this point in 
the three words, ‘“ Discriminate, discriminate, dis- 
criminate.” The teacher should know for what he 
is working and he should do his best to attain it. It 
is usually better to have a few well-defined purposes 
than to try to accomplish too much. A teacher who 
was noted for getting results explained by saying: “I 
try to accomplish something, usually something very 
simple, each recitation. I veritably pound upon this 
issue until I know that it is sinking in. These simple 
daily elements finally unite to make up the larger 
results you observe.” 
Such central issues may be very different in several 
recitations. In one the teacher may plan to teach the 
children to think. He will ‘ pound”’ upon thought. 
In other recitations drill of a purely mechanical nature 
may be the central factor. In this case the teacher 
tries to see that each child gets the needed amount 
of proper exercise. In still other recitations special 
facts are selected, or such important activities as co- 
operation, competition on the higher plane, speaking 
clearly and effectively, and so on, are emphasized. 
These definite issues must, when put together, make 
up a general plan for worthy results. 
Work on These Four Elements Usually Brings 
Improvement. — Too many points are likely to be 
more confusing than helpful. The teacher should 
limit the number of issues in his plan so that he can 
have time to secure results. The four factors given  
-P-A-G-E-229
  
FUNDAMENTALS OF CLASSROOM PRACTICE 199 
above represent ideals that the average teacher is 
likely to find useful in his plan for improving his daily 
classroom practice. 
To repeat, the four big essentials in improving 
classroom practice are: 
1. Classroom work is fundamental. Emphasize its im- 
portance. 
2. Make each child a special problem for study. 
8. Do not talk too much. 
4. Emphasize a few important issues. Do not try to 
teach too much.! 
Piannine ScHoot Work 
Should the Teacher Plan His Work? — The answer 
from all the best teachers is unanimously ‘ Yes.” 
They plan their work with care. They leave nothing 
to chance. Incidental teaching in the haphazard 
sense is unknown to them, and the slipshod drifting 
of the slovenly mind through masses of unorganized 
facts is totally absent from their practice. 
However, mechanical rigidity is always avoided. 
Good plans anticipate independent questions and 
remarks by students. They are flexible to the ex- 
tent that issues about which the teacher did not 
think when making his plans may be brought up and 
welcomed. 
1 Six points in the socialization of the everyday recitation are given 
in Chapter VI. They should be considered along with this discussion. 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
200 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
Plans Provide Freedom from Worry. — When the 
teacher’s mind is made up as to what he shall do in a 
recitation, and when he has prepared himself, he can 
rest, recreate, or turn to other work. There is no work 
more burdensome than that which must be done under 
the constant strain of not knowing what to do next. 
The superior teacher will not undergo this worry. 
The constant uncertainty that characterizes the teacher 
who does not plan his work is extremely demoralizing 
as well as hygienically injurious. No teacher can 
continue long to love his work unless he plans for tt. 
Plans Gain Respect of Classes. — The members of 
every class have a wholesome respect for the teacher 
who knows what he is about and has some definite 
organization in his work. The most utter disrespect 
on the part of classes is often developed for a teacher 
who may know his subject well but does not take time 
to organize it for teaching. Many of the pupils think 
he is really uninformed and fail to note that the diffi- 
culty is merely lack of organization. 
How to Use Plans. — Superior teachers report that 
they use their plans as a guide and a background. 
Plans should never be rigidly followed. The teacher 
controls the plan and is not tied down by it. As a 
guide, however, it keeps him in contact with the gen- 
eral scheme of the year or the day and makes it un- 
necessary to burden the mind by trying to plan while 
the lesson is in progress. Plans “ made up as you 
teach ” are always more or less short-sighted.
-P-A-G-E-231
     FUNDAMENTALS OF CLASSROOM PRACTICE 201 
It is rarely found necessary to write down the de- 
tails of a plan. It is usually sketched in rough out- 
line, is suggestive rather than exhaustive, and contains, 
in addition to the skeleton of the lesson, references 
that are otherwise likely to be forgotten. 
It has been found advantageous to let the children 
know something of the plans. They should, by all 
means, be made acquainted with the big issues of the 
year, and they should realize why such issues are im- 
portant. Some of the brighter children will go ahead 
with the work of their own initiative when they know 
the plan for the year. It is also well to let them know 
something about the methods that are being used. 
They may take part in planning a project, and they 
should be told the essential features of effective drill 
so they may apply them in practice at home or at 
times when the teacher is not present. 
Types of Plans. — Modern educators are working 
to avoid the ambiguity of the older type of plan but 
to retain its idea of definite organization. The formal 
plans, although they probably had some basic values, 
led many teachers, so they report, to disrespect les- 
son plans. 
Types of plans used by successful teachers will be 
considered in detail here. They are simple and direct. 
The outline usually consists of three points: 
1. A Series of Aims or Purposes. — These indicate 
the factors to be emphasized and control the method 
that is to be used. The aims will vary with the class,
-P-A-G-E-232
202 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
the subject to be presented (its difficulty for the 
children), and the local community. 
2. A Definite Selection of Subject Matter in Accord- 
ance with the Aims. — Whether he realizes it or not, 
the teacher selects subject matter each day. It is 
impossible to teach everything at the same dead level. 
It is impossible for the children to remember all that 
is taken up in the lesson. Therefore, | in making his 
plans, the teacher should select and evaluate so that 
he will emphasize what is most valuable. 
3. A Method of Procedure.— This includes or- 
ganization of subject matter as well as a scheme for 
drawing out interest, initiative, and other like factors. 
How special results that seem worth while are to be 
secured, how the various members of the class are to 
be given proper exercise and tested, how initiative 
is to be stimulated, all these factors are met in plan- 
ning the method of procedure. 
Concrete ILLUSTRATIONS OF RECITATIONS 
TAUGHT FROM PLANS | 
Arithmetic. — First ten minutes’ drill upon special ele- 
ments in which the class has been found weak. The drill for 
to-day will be upon reading problems: a problem will be 
selected, each child will read, and when he is ready to suggest 
a method for solution he will raise his hand. 
Following this, the six problems assigned for the day’s 
lesson will be worked on the board. Those who had trouble 
with the problems will put them on the board. Those who 
had no trouble will be assigned other work. This extra work
-P-A-G-E-233
FUNDAMENTALS OF CLASSROOM PRACTICE 203 
will consist of three rather difficult problems. (Not given 
on account of limited space.) 
At this time, those at the board will be supervised. In 
each case the teacher leads the child to surmount his 
difficulties. 
The next step in the recitation is the answering of ques- 
tions. Any child may ask questions relative to how the 
assigned problems are solved. Other children will be called 
upon to answer his questions. 
The assignment for the next day consists of six more 
problems. The final step is to inspect the work done by the 
children who had no trouble with the six assigned problems. 
These now show their work for inspection. The others be- 
gin work upon the six problems assigned for the next day.! 
This lesson has the following advantages: (1) Drill 
is provided for both rapid and slow children. (2) The 
. teacher gives special attention to those who need it. 
(3) Those who do not need special attention are pro- 
vided with useful work. (4) Those who have difficul- 
ties are allowed opportunity to ask questions. (5) Those 
who were assigned more difficult problems were given 
final attention, while weak students were given time 
to get a start on the next day’s work. This attention 
to the work of the brighter students gave the touch of 
recognition that adds incentive. Had the teacher 
merely assigned the extra problems without making a 
final check on the work, the children soon would have 
lost interest. 
History. — The aim for the day is to develop an insight 
1These plans are merely illustrative. The teacher must always 
fit his own plans to the conditions under which he works. 
 
-P-A-G-E-234
204 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
into the problems of territorial expansion. This general 
problem is being emphasized during the week. Statements of 
facts and extended discussion make up the work of the period. 
| The method is to carry on a regular recitation upon six 
pages of the text. In addition, five children report on special 
literature they have read, and any child who desires may re- 
port on special reading that is provided for those who have 
time for it. 
For the first ten minutes a “free for all’’ discussion in which 
the teacher serves as umpire will take place. This will be 
followed by the five reports, each report being followed by a 
short discussion by the class. Finally the children who did 
extra work will be given a chance to report, and such reports 
will be followed by questions. 
The selection of subject matter is taken care of by the 
teacher, who brings books to class, makes the assignment 
in the text, and refers the five children who make special re- 
ports to suitable literature. She also gives these children 
advice as to how to handle the topics. 
We have here, first of all, an important problem. It 
is considered in the text and in reference books. Chil- 
dren make special reports; this gives opportunity and 
occasion for individual research, regular chances for 
extended recitations, and organization. 
English. — The first five minutes devoted to rapid-fire 
drill on the use of lay and lie with special attention to their 
past and perfect tenses. Sentences will be made up during 
the recitation. The teacher takes a few minutes here to 
make sure that he has the correct forms in mind. (Many 
teachers are not certain about the past and perfect tenses 
of these words.) 
This being a lesson in oral English, ten children were
-P-A-G-E-235
  FUNDAMENTALS OF CLASSROOM PRACTICE 205 
previously named to make short speeches. Each speech is 
to be limited to one and one-half minutes, and is followed 
by discussion of one minute. With a class of thirty, ten 
children speak each day. This gives each child an oppor- 
tunity to make a speech every third day. The aim is to 
develop clearness, organization, speaking to the point, cor- 
rect usage, and fluency. 
The assignment for the next day is now made. It is fo- 
cused upon the correct usage of teach and learn in all their 
tenses. Ten children are selected to make speeches for the 
next day. 
Again we have a definite scheme of working for 
special aims. Drill and discussion based upon the 
assignment open the period. This is followed by pro- 
vision for exercise in the abilities to be developed. 
Running throughout is evidence of the selection and 
emphasis of useful subject matter. 
No one can fail to see the clear-cut emphasis upon 
definite aims, definite methods of attaining these aims, 
and selection of subject matter in accordance with the 
aims and methods in the three plans given above. 
Such plans make the work of the modern teacher 
simple, direct, and effective. They prevent lost 
motion. They are not burdensome; but they provide 
freedom from worry and make profitable work fairly 
certain. If a supervisor should ask a teacher who 
has such a plan in mind, what he intends to do to- 
morrow, why he intends to do it, and how he intends 
to do it, he need not falter in giving his answer. This 
is the test of proper plans for daily work. If the 
 
-P-A-G-E-236
206 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
teacher will ask himself these three questions and 
answer them in a satisfactory way, his plan for the 
next day is complete: 
What to do? — the selection of subject matter 
Why? — the aim 
How? — the method 
It is not often possible to answer these questions 
without doing special work in preparation. In such 
cases it is easier to prepare than it is to worry about 
lack of preparation. 
The special merits of plans based upon these three 
elements are: (1) They are specific. (2) The scheme 
is understood by teachers and is comprehensive enough 
to cover any set of ideals. (3) The scheme is flexible. 
It will fit into any phase of teaching. Even if a test 
is to be given, the teacher should have an aim for test- 
ing, he should select his material with care, and he 
should give the test in a way that will result in fairness 
to all and provide a genuine test for the abilities that 
are being investigated. (4) Such plans help the super- 
visor. Too often ‘“ plans” are useful merely to al- 
low training teachers or supervisors to see whether 
or not the teacher is making preparation. Not infre- 
quently the planning of lessons is dropped as soon as 
the supervision or training ceases. 
1 Many training schools are now using plans of this new type. The 
writer used them for three years as principal of the training school, 
State Teachers’ College, Greeley, Colorado, and for four years as direc- 
tor of practice teaching at the University of Washington.
-P-A-G-E-237
    FUNDAMENTALS OF CLASSROOM PRACTICE 207 
Plans for the Year, Term, Month, or Unit. — The 
first essential in planning for units is a survey of the 
entire course of study with a careful consideration of 
the outlines of study for the grades or classes just 
below and above the one for which the general plan 
is being made. This need not take much time, and 
it makes possible a much more intelligent attack upon 
the work at hand. This should be followed by a second 
survey which takes in books, both text and reference, 
and other equipment that are at hand. The teacher 
then knows just what is possible with the material 
with which he has to work. However, the plans 
should not be completed until after a study of the 
class. The first three weeks should be devoted to a 
careful testing and diagnosis of each pupil. 
After these preliminaries the plan for the year may 
be made. First of all the immediate course of study 
should be considered and the large aims noted. At 
this juncture or earlier a conversation with the prin- 
cipal or supervisor is important. 
The aims finally decided upon should be kept in 
mind throughout the year. In accordance with the 
aims the course of study is studied and marked. Some 
parts of it are to be dwelt upon much longer than are 
other parts. When a careful study of this kind has 
been made, the course of study loses its terrors, and 
with average classes the teacher finds plenty of time 
for a great deal of profitable work, in addition to re- 
quirements. There will be time for home projects,
-P-A-G-E-238
  208 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
dramatizations, discussions of outside interests, sup- 
plementary reading, and other valuable features of 
modern teaching. 
The next and final step is a general plan of the meth- 
ods to be used throughout the year. These should 
be based upon the aims, the course of study, the school 
equipment, and the natures of the children. Special 
methods should be planned, dealing with every issue 
in the larger aims for the year. If a dramatization 
is planned, it may at this time be given its proper 
place. Drills of various types for the different ele- 
ments of the course of study may be devised. Methods 
of developing new units may be considered. Reviews 
may be planned. In fact, the possibilities of the en- 
tire year may be considered and nothing left entrely to 
chance inspiration, although the plan does not prevent 
the use of any good idea that may come up later on. 
In the same way the work of a term, month, or unit 
should be planned in advance. Such provision as- 
sures the teacher that he will not suddenly discover 
that his work “is only just begun and the term is 
almost over,” as many teachers are known to report 
each term. 
ILLusTRATIVE PLAN FoR TERM — SEVENTH- 
GrapDE ENGLISH 
Background Principles 
1. English is taught in order to teach children to speak, 
read, and write fluently, effectively, and correctly. These
-P-A-G-E-239
  FUNDAMENTALS OF CLASSROOM PRACTICE 209 
points are in the order of importance as they shall be em- 
ployed throughout this term. 
2. The core of the composition course should consist of a 
few permanent activities of the project type affording sys- 
tematic practice in English, oral and written. 
3. These activities should represent some definite social 
English form, distinguishing them from activities of other 
departments. 
4. These permanent activities should be broad enough 
to admit of minor activities, fitting for any community and 
allowing for codperation with other departments. 
5. All technical matters of spelling, punctuation, capi- 
talization, vocabulary building, and organizations shall, as 
far as possible, be centered about these activities. For ex- 
ample, a class using a post-office activity centered all techni- 
cal matters around civil service examinations, making pro- 
motions dependent on correct punctuation, spelling, and 
writing. The class may be divided into clans for the study 
of “The Lady of the Lake,’’ using clan organization and 
rivalry in elimination of useless “ands,” commonly misspelled 
words, and mistakes in form. 
6. Only as much technique will be taught at a time as is 
to be required in practice. 
Aims for Term 
1. Of the Pupil: 
a. To use English as a tool that will secure for him indi- 
vidual success in the new school environment. 
2. Of the Teacher : 
a. To establish relationship between the English class 
and other classes as a necessary end to successful teaching 
of English. 
b. To increase powers of observation, organization, and 
expression.
-P-A-G-E-240
210 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
c. To train the mind to demand sentence completion 
and its signification by proper inflection and punctuation. 
d. To fasten by practice elementary knowledge of capi- 
talization, punctuation, and agreement. 
Selection of Subject Matter 
Oral English 
Occasional reproductions of certain incidents found in 
literature work and in outside reading. Original stories 
suggested by study will limit the telling to one episode and 
avoid digression. Will emphasize in State Readers for the 
Seventh Grade, 84, 89, 100, 151, 189, also “Studies in Eng- 
lish,” Study 338. 
Will stress simple selections from State Series, Book Seven, 
history stories, science readers, and any other easy supple- 
mentary texts at hand. 
Composition 
Paragraphs drawn from class work in history, science, or 
literature. For example, explain how to make a plan, a box, 
ora cake. Write up a sample experiment in science, say an 
experiment in air pressure. For work in paragraph structure 
will emphasize ‘Studies in English,’’ Book 3, 229, 230. 
Other experiences, real or imaginary: We shall write 
letters to other schools telling of first experiences in the new 
grade. As another kind of activity will suggest to chil- 
dren as follows: “Imagine yourself in Plymouth in No- 
vember, 1620. Write a letter to a friend in England telling 
her of some one phase of the first Thanksgiving Day.” 
Rules of English (Grammar) 
Practice in sentence completion and quick recognition of 
incomplete and complete groups. Material for practice to 
be collected from class work in all subjects and activities.
-P-A-G-E-241
FUNDAMENTALS OF CLASSROOM PRACTICE 211 
Dictation exercises and the rewriting of unpunctuated 
paragraphs. 
Test the vitality of this work by noting whether pupils 
show an increasing tendency to write and punctuate cor- 
rectly. 
Emphasize “Applied English Grammar,” 51 to 129, 
“Studies in English,” Book 3, Lesson 1. 
Emphasize kinds of sentences. Questions, statements, 
exclamations, and commands drawn from class work in all 
subjects, giving special attention to “Studies in English,” 
Book 8, Lessons 12, 13, 14. Test the vitality of this work 
by the ability of the pupil to give a simple explanation or de- 
scription without awkward change from the command to 
the statement form, or the reverse. 
Drill on Mechanic 
Training in correct form of manuscripts, schedules, notices, 
notebooks, or any work required in school. Capitalization of 
titles, proper names, seasons, days of week, names of subjects. 
Some of this will be done in connection with spelling and 
dictionary period. Punctuation: terminal punctuation, 
appositives, series. Spelling of plurals and of common 
abbreviations emphasized in connection with spelling — dic- 
tionary period. 
Shall begin all drill work with words in immediate use: 
teachers’ names, their titles, capitalization of subjects, etc. 
Work in capitalization and punctuation to be based upon 
“Studies in English,” Book 3. School terms often mis- 
pronounced shall be given special attention as athletics, 
mathematics, recess, geography, laboratory, history, American, 
Italian, ete. 
Will practice on word completion, the sounding of final 
d’s, t’s, and g’s, as in coming, doing, nothing, climb. Errors 
will be taken from pupil’s conversations. For practice on
-P-A-G-E-242
212 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
final g’s will use “The Cataract of Lodore,” “Studies in 
English,” Book 3, Study 330. For final d’s and ?’s will use 
“California’s Cup of Gold,” Seventh Reader, page 319. 
Drill upon special grammatical errors emphasizing the 
overcoming of the use of this here, that there, those; confu- 
sion of in, into; between, among; agreement of verb with 
simple subject. Special attention to sentences beginning 
with There. 
Methods to Be Employed 
A Success Club or Rotary Club will be formed. Purpose: 
A survey of the work to be accomplished and the means of 
success. The following types of organized activities will 
be used : 
1. The term’s work, the schedule. Children will decide 
on the value of each subject. Get from teacher named in 
schedule a statement of what will be expected of them. 
Memorize schedule. Be able to write it with correct spelling, 
proper abbreviations, and capitals. 
2. Children plan for the day’s work, study hours, and 
recitation. Discussion of relative benefits of each plan sug- 
gested and selection of one. 
3. Each child give a name to each paragraph in history 
or English lesson. Outline a story or selection in reader, or 
a lesson in history. Tell the story from outline. 
4. The recitation. Each child will make a list of class 
procedure in different classes. Use different kinds of recita- 
tions — the questions and answer method, and the topical 
recitations. Study of method of preparing for either kind 
of recitation, and rules of conduct governing it. 
5. A Recreation Department in the business club, when 
programs, dramatizations, and stories could be presented 
and the relation between a man’s leisure hours and business 
successes emphasized. 
 
-P-A-G-E-243
  FUNDAMENTALS OF CLASSROOM PRACTICE 213 
6. An occasional imaginary banquet with after-dinner 
stories and funny speeches. 
7. A Corrective Department in which members guilty 
of poor English may have corrective exercises. 
8. An Etiquette Club. Discussion of the part good 
manners play in success. Formulation of rules of conduct 
in classrooms, balls, and on grounds. Ways and means of 
forming good habits. 
9. Writing of diary of daily experiences, or a column for 
school paper that shall gain sympathy for beginners and be 
a help and inspiration to other beginners. Will consider here 
Cuore’s Journal of a School-Boy, Mary Antin’s The Promised 
Land. 
10. A Story Teller’s Club. Famous quests of all lands 
and ages. 
Results Expected 
1. Ability to stand before the class and tell a short story 
or talk for a minute or two in any class on one phase of a 
familiar topic in complete sentences, properly inflected and 
reasonably free from useless ands, the double subject, and 
the dropping of final letters. 
2. To read a simple poem or paragraph intelligibly, in- 
flecting properly for sentence completion, so that the ideas 
are conveyed clearly to the audience. 
8. Ability to write a short paragraph with correct punc- 
tuation, and without awkward change from the command 
to statement form in the same paragraph and reasonably 
free from errors. 
4. The ability to stick to the point in class discussion or 
in oral or written composition. 
5. Ability to recognize complete groups of words, and the 
habit of properly punctuating them in written composition.
-P-A-G-E-244
  214 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
6. Habitually correct pronunciation and spelling of words 
drilled upon in this grade. 
7. The habit of handing in all work punctually and in 
proper form. 
8. The habit of listening courteously and giving construc- 
tive criticism. 
This plan was tried by a number of teachers in a 
progressive educational center and modified by the 
writer in accordance with the findings of these teachers. 
It may not be possible to apply all the specific methods 
suggested under that division, and it may be noted 
that it was impossible to draw a close line between 
aims, selection of subject matter, and methods. How- 
ever, we have here a good illustration of a complete 
term plan that has been given thorough practical ap- 
plication. The teacher with such a plan is sure to do 
better work than he could without it. 
SuMMARY IN SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE 
1. Make up your mind to ezcel in classroom practice. 
Place this first in your plan for improvement. 
2. Emphasize in each period a few important issues. 
Do not try to teach too much or to teach everything 
at the same high level. Discriminate. 
3. Give every child the exercise he needs. Study 
each child and make his needs a special problem. 
4. Do not take for yourself the exercise that the 
children should have. Talk less; guide and inspire 
more.
-P-A-G-E-245
  FUNDAMENTALS OF CLASSROOM PRACTICE 215 
5. Plan your work by making your aims, selection 
of subject matter, and methods focus so that the re- 
sults of each day’s work will further the larger issues 
of the unit, term or year. 
6. Avoid the worry and distrust to which a teacher 
who does not organize and plan his work is sure to be 
subjected.

  CHAPTER X 
CLASSROOM PRACTICES (Continued) 
MoraLe AND THE DETAILS OF ScHooL WorK 
It is a part of a conscious purpose to associate in the 
same chapter morale and the details of school work. 
Morale, although one of the most powerful social forces, 
is dependent upon the successful operation of many 
apparently small details. The development of morale 
rests upon the proper execution of things of an ap- 
parently mechanical nature. In this chapter, there- 
fore, the reader should consider the relationship that 
exists between these two apparently widely different 
fundamentals of teaching. 
MorALE 
Morale a World Force. — The morale of the people 
of a nation, an army, a state, a city, a school, a family, 
or even of an individual is now being recognized as a 
basic factor in determining what each may accomplish. 
It may be described as a power possessed by groups or 
individuals that is the one necessary element to human 
success, especially in difficult situations. It embraces 
a large number of qualities and may bring success in 
217
-P-A-G-E-250
218 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
apparently hopeless situations when many of the 
physical obstacles seem to be insurmountable. 
Psychology has long recognized that the “ attitude ” 
is a controlling factor in many types of mental action. 
In an ordinary perception the attitude or set of con- 
sciousness is an important factor in what the individual 
may see, hear, or “sense.”” In common parlance we 
often hear such statements as “a person looking for 
trouble can easily find it,” ‘‘ Love is blind,” “ The 
wish was father of the thought,” “He saw what he 
wanted to see,” and so on, while careful psychologists 
have come to the conclusion that such a simple per- 
ception as that of seeing and recognizing an ink bottle 
depends first upon the “frame of mind” or “set of 
consciousness ”’ of the observer. 
Morale, however, contains many other elements, and 
it appears in a great many degrees of intensity and in 
widely different forms. One of the most important 
elements is feeling tone; even in common everyday life 
the establishment of proper “tone” is extremely 
important. The morale of an army is likely to be 
better in battle than at times of waiting. Excitement 
may lift an individual or a group to great heights of 
achievement. The situation in such a case brings the 
feeling or emotional tone that creates a temporary 
mental and physical “ drive.” After the victory or 
defeat the morale must be sustained. It is often as, 
difficult to withstand victory or prosperity as it is to 
recover from defeat,
-P-A-G-E-251
  CLASSROOM PRACTICES 219 
The teachershould realizethat by building up the mo- 
rale of his school and of each child in the school he is not 
only establishing the force that will make for achieve- 
ment in school work but is providing a powerful 
smoothly running organization for purposes of learning 
and development. He is also working for a result that 
is to extend much farther than the school ; he is helping 
in the creation of a world force. Such a force is essen- 
tial in the establishment of world peace, temperance, 
universal brotherhood, or any of the great world as- 
pirations of thinking men and women. It is also a 
key to civic duty in the home community, the making of 
a good neighbor, the establishment of charity in the 
home, and other commonplace practical virtues which 
must precede all larger aspirations. 
Morale in Military Science. — Morale is the term 
used to describe the “‘ state of mind ” of an army or of 
an individual soldier. Military science has discovered 
that the mental, moral, and physical status of a man or 
a group of men may be developed by definite courses 
of training, and the establishment of proper external 
conditions. Back in the days of Rome we are told 
that one day a certain Arius looked over the oarsmen 
in his galley and saw a man whose outward form was 
not exceptional but whose oar was bent at each ap- 
parently easy stroke, and when he noted carefully the 
attitude of this man, he made the remark that strength 
is a quality, not a quantity. Those who have read 
Ben Hur know that the training and past experience
-P-A-G-E-252
220 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
of this man had developed his spirit as well as his body. 
This was what Arius saw in the stroke of his oar. 
When Wellington had defeated Napoleon at Waterloo, 
he is reported to have said that the victory had really 
been won long ago on the play fields of Eton and 
Rugby. Here had been developed the physical, mental, 
and moral courage and ability to execute orders that 
had won the world’s most famous battle. 
In the great World War, where science was employed 
in every possible place, morale eventually became the 
most important issue. In a definite campaign to 
develop his accomplishment possibility to the highest 
point the morale of every soldier! was made a primary 
issue. The thousands of stories of what men did as the 
result of such training are convincing of its effects. 
The means used to a defensive end should not be 
ignored by those who are engaged in the great con- 
structive campaign for individual and world betterment 
through education. 
The devices used to develop soldier morale are not so 
important as are the principles. The art of the teacher 
must employ the means at hand to fit the conditions under 
which he must work in the formation and use of devices. 
Underlying principles cannot be changed extensively, 
and when once established in the mind of the teacher 
allow for the development of any number of devices. 
1 This discussion does not indicate that the school should use army 
methods. It merely calls attention to the part played by morale in 
training men for war. 
 
-P-A-G-E-253
    CLASSROOM PRACTICES 221 
Some of the principles used by military leaders in the 
great war were: 
1. It was the plan to spend years in the training of 
the spirit of accomplishment, so that no task would be 
so large as to discourage an army so trained ; the first 
principle being the recognition of the value of this 
training of the spirit. 
2. Time and energy were spent without stint in 
establishing thoroughly in the mind of the soldier the 
righteousness of the cause for which he was fighting. 
3. It was a part of the plan to convince him of the 
importance of his own efforts in behalf of this righteous 
cause. 
4. Every conceivable device was used to cause the 
soldier to coéperate with the different groups, from that 
in command of the lowest petty officer to the entire 
army. Everything that social psychology could suggest 
was tried. 
5. Physical handicaps to proper training were 
removed when possible, and when they could not be 
removed special methods were used in meeting and 
overcoming them. 
6. When work was not being done recreation was 
planned. The soldier must not be left without oppor- 
tunity to work or play during any of the hoursof the day. 
7. The officer became a central issue in the develop- 
ment of this morale. It was found that there was no 
element in his makeup so small but that it might have 
some influence upon the morale of his soldiers. 
 
-P-A-G-E-254
  222 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
Mora.e IN THE AMERICAN SCHOOL 
If morale proved to be of such importance in the 
waging of war, it will be far more important in the 
building of a world civilization. The teacher, en- 
gaged in the occupation of community, nation, and 
world building, does not feel the immediate pressure 
that urges on the officer engaged in getting soldiers 
ready for a battle, but if the teacher can be made to see 
the tremendous importance of his task and the far- 
reaching results of his activities, he is more likely to see 
the need of utilizing such principles as those described 
in the foregoing section, in the school. 
In the application of the above principles, superior 
teachers have been observed to work as follows: 
1. They see in each child a future citizen. They 
know that the use of force, domination by virtue of 
position, retardation, elimination, or other easy methods 
of meeting the immediate situation do not solve the 
ultimate problem. Therefore, they plan to work with 
each child and each group of children with the aim of 
building up an individual and group spirit, which will 
not only make for greater effort, great accomplishment, 
and a happier immediate situation, but will continue 
with the children with whom they have come in contact, 
making them larger and stronger as the years go by and 
eventually cause them to play their part in making the 
nation and the entire world.a better place in which to 
live.
-P-A-G-E-255
  CLASSROOM PRACTICES ~— 223 
2. They work to establish in the child’s mind that 
oneness of feeling or unity with the better things of life. 
Long before there is any possibility of dissension the 
superior teacher has established in the minds of the 
children the feeling of unity and the knowledge of the 
value of what is being done, of the righteousness and 
necessity of everything that is a part of the plan of 
work. It is practically impossible to disturb seriously 
such aclass. The children grow to feel that the success 
of their school work and of school enterprises is abso- 
lutely necessary. 
3. The recognition of the child’s effort. The child 
must be convinced that what he is doing is of importance 
to the different causes in which he is enlisted. The 
teacher should spare no effort and be willing to consume 
considerable time in establishing the child in the belief 
that what he does counts. Work should be definitely 
planned to bring legitimate success to every child. 
The following quotation may be of interest at this place. 
“What can be more depressing than continuous failure in 
whatever one undertakes? As our classes are now arranged 
and school work ordered, it often happens that month after 
month no children. have any legitimate opportunity to succeed. 
If a chance to leave school occurs, naturally they take it. 
“Tn the American school, and even in many American 
homes, such artificial restrictions are often made that the 
most obvious opportunities for self-assertion by the children, 
and the most tempting opportunity for social success, con- 
sist in breaking the rules of the school or in disregarding the 
exhortations of anxious parents. I have the report of one 
 
-P-A-G-E-256
  224 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
school where the boys made it a point of honor to break all 
the rules of the school, and they counted that day lost when 
they did not succeed. Such achievement by a boy of this 
school was a distinct social success for him, and of course it 
gave the boy the satisfaction that comes from success.” 
On the other hand, good teaching requires that success 
be worked for. But let us quote further from the article 
just mentioned. ‘The pathology of success is really a very 
large subject. It concerns not merely overstimulation that 
comes from continued success without normal relaxation, 
but the extreme self-consciousness of success that occurs in 
the case of bright children of unstable nervous organization 
where it develops into ego complexes, and finally, perhaps, 
into megalomania. 
“Most tragic of all perhaps is the fact that the stimulus 
of success is intoxicating, and is likely to make one heady. 
Hence is needed the antitoxin of failure. In the early stages 
this is a valuable remedy for the ego complex. 
“The need of success as a wholesome stimulus is universal. 
Children have an enormous appetite for it. They need large 
doses. Adults become depressed without it. It is vital for 
the normal. The diseased are often cured by it... . 
“Tt is a problem of giving each case something to do that 
is worth while, and of placing each individual in a situation 
where success is likely to occur ; and when we recall the essen- 
tial psychology of success we find that this is possible in many 
forms of work, and that the psychological success in doing 
ordinary work properly, in itself, is a stimulus to further 
work, and often the most important condition of mental 
health. In this sense every worker can give himself the 
benefit of this wonderful tonic.” !

ham, of Clark University, President of Massachusetts Society of 
Mental Hygiene. July, 1919.

4. Coéperation is made a central issue. The child 
is made to feel his value to others as well as their value 
to him. Even in the details of common everyday 
politeness to others, he is taught to see the larger issue 
of human codéperation as a background and necessity. 
He learns that all his actions concern and influence 
others, and he is taught in such a way as to make 
codperation a pleasure. 
5. Superior teachers leave no stone unturned to 
make the physical situation further the plan for the 
development of morale. Everything that it is possible 
to do is done to make the child feel comfortable and 
physically at ease. While physical development is a 
special aim in education not secondary to anything, 
the fact that physical well being and comfort are con- 
ducive to morale must also be kept in mind. Consider 
the following illustrations : 
T. R. Cole, Superintendent of Schools at Seattle, Wash- 
ington, reports a fifth grade that had caused a great deal of 
difficulty. Three different teachers had found the pupils im- 
possible to manage. Early in the morning the work would 
usually be excellent, but, before recess, control became im- 
possible. Every child in the room either was nervous or re- 
fused to pay attention to his work. An investigation of the 
situation revealed the fact that when the seats were being 
placed, no one was present except the janitor. He had 
placed the desks and the seats several inches too far apart. 
When the seats were changed, discipline was no longer a 
problem and an opportunity was provided for building up 
morale.
-P-A-G-E-258
  226 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
A student in a higher institution reports that on one occa- 
sion he found it, necessary to have a tooth extracted. He 
went to a dentist who was able to remove only the upper 
part and left the nerve exposed. He advised the student 
to wait, saying that the tooth would loosen so that complete 
removal would be possible. He waited for six weeks, and 
he said that during these six weeks his character was per- 
manently injured. He had been in excellent spirits up to 
this time, and his work had been quite successful. During 
the six weeks the constant irritation from his tooth was al- 
ways in the background during every conversation, study 
period, recitation, or plan. Often it was also very much in 
the foreground. Whenever he awoke at night, he found it 
waitingforhim. It wasa miserable accompaniment to every- 
thing he attempted. He felt himself gradually “losing his 
grip.” He made numerous mistakes that he had never made 
before, and found his interest in accomplishment waning. De- 
ciding to wait no longer he went to another dentist, who, after 
two hours of difficult work, succeeded in removing the entire 
tooth. Immense relief was, of course, the result. But the 
student reports that although two years have elapsed he has not 
been able to overcome entirely the effects of the associations dur- 
ing this six weeks. 
Thousands of cases like the two above occur daily in 
schoolrooms of this country. When the children have 
been sitting overlong, morale is sure to be at a low ebb, 
and the need for discipline is likely. A textbook with 
print that is difficult to read has been found to be a 
very disturbing factor. Colds, a stuffy room, a windy

pains or analyze the results so well as do adults, but the effects are just

or a hot day, and numerous apparently minor factors 
combine to make school work ineffective. However, 
when all these conditions are recognized and dealt with 
from the positive side, life at school is bound to be upon 
a higher plane than it otherwise could be. 
6. Wise provision for something wholesome to do 
must be made at all times. When a child finishes a task, 
he should understand that there are many interesting 
occupations that await him. The entire school must 
be organized with a plan for wholesome play and recre- 
ation. This is of the utmost importance to morale. 
7. The teacher must work upon himself so to act, 
speak, and appear that the children will feel in unison 
with him. Every detail in his dress, every small 
mannerism, is important, while it will surely be im- 
possible to establish morale if, in the larger sense, in his 
heart and soul he is not thoroughly sympathetic with 
the children and interested in his work. 
Morale and Discipline. — Superior teachers try to 
avoid any evidence of discipline. They usually report 
that it is an unfortunate waste of time and that they 
work to establish a feeling that law and order are a 
ovrivilege of codperation for the good of every one con- 
cerned, and when it is necessary to discipline any child 
the matter is made private and the group is not dis- 
turbed. The introductory statement in Dr. Bagley’s 
School Discipline is well worth consideration here. 
“Tt is a paradox of the well-disciplined school that ‘disci- 
pline’ is conspicuous by its absence. If an intelligent ob-

ence to its discipline, one may be fairly confident that the 
school is ‘ well-disciplined.’”’ 
Illustrations of the attitude of an unsuccessful 
teacher in contrast to that of a superior teacher on this 
point follow: 
In this investigation a man was discovered who had left 
teaching to go into business. He contended that teaching 
was the most difficult and worrying work that could be found, 
and he “did not wonder that good men did not stay in the 
profession.”” He had taught for twenty years and had finally 
become the principal of a small school of fewer than one 
hundred children at a salary of one thousand dollars. Upon 
being asked to tell of his experiences the best he was able to 
do was to tell story after story of how he had caught 
“bad boys” at their mischief. This, to him, seemed to 
be the important element of school work. Is it any wonder 
that he thought teaching to be a nerve-racking occupation or 
that in twenty years his salary rose only to the above men- 
tioned figure? 
In discussing educational problems for a period of six weeks 
with a superior teacher discipline was never mentioned. She 
had been teaching for ten years, had held positions all the 
way from grade school teacher to that of principal of a large 
elementary school in a progressive city; nor was she leaving 
the occupation for other fields. When asked about discipline, 
she merely smiled, and added that the great majority of chil- 
dren were interesting to study, and concluded that there 
were very few really bad children. ‘‘ Bad cases” from other 
schools were frequently transferred to her school. Most of 
them improved while there and went out into the world or 
on to high school with a better attitude.

Everypay MECHANICS AND DETAILS 
Eliminating Drudgery. — An obvious difference be- 
tween the successful and the unsuccessful teacher is 
that revealed in the attitude towards everyday work. 
One conspicuous difference was the pleasure of the 
former and the pain of the latter in daily work. The 
poor teacher rises each morning to face “ the day’s 
grind ’’ as many have been heard to term their regular 
work. The better teacher awakes each morning to a 
new day of accomplishment, because the small duties 
of his work have been met and mastered, and he has 
both time and energy for larger issues. 
Every teacher should try to find pleasure in common- 
place daily tasks. It is obvious that work will be 
painful, is likely to undermine health, and is sure to be 
done in a slovenly manner if factors that must be met 
again and again each day are not mastered to the 
extent that performance becomes a pleasure. We have 
numerous experiments which show that the perform- 
ance of the most mechanical task is keenly enjoyed 
by those who thoroughly master it. There is nothing 
so unpleasant as work in which some small detail 
continually interferes with performance. 
School Marks.1— The necessity for giving marks 
cannot be avoided. All the best teachers in our group 
1 These words are used to indicate that part of the teacher’s duties 
that is devoted to studying the work of the children, fixing rank in 
class, assigning marks, and so on.
-P-A-G-E-262
230 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
were conscientious in this matter. There is a great 
difference, however, between what may be termed a 
conscientious, intelligent attitude and the narrow view 
that magnifies a grade or mark out of all proportion to 
its value. The superior teacher realizes that a grade 
is given to a child in order to help him. He also plans 
ways of obtaining accurate estimates without making 
the process too prominent. The grade book should 
never be flourished in front of the children and used as a 
goad. This practice is common in poor teaching. The 
mediocre teacher is very likely to begin discussing 
grades at the beginning of the term and to wax warmer 
upon this chosen theme each week until the term is 
over. His superior neighbor gets better results, marks 
more accurately, and spends far less time doing it. 
Illustration of Successful Methods of Rating and 
Marking. —In the chapter devoted to methods of 
testing numerous illustrations of tests and examinations 
are furnished. In this place the mechanical aspects of 
grading will be illustrated. 
Eighth-grade class of thirty-seven children. The method 
used in arithmetic will be considered here. For the first 
week the teacher did little more than test. Every child was 
sounded in everything of value that had been covered up to 
this grade. Tests were so constructed that the children could 
change papers and mark them in accordance with the direc- 
tions of the teacher. Each child kept a notebook in which 
he recorded the mistakes that were likely to hinder him in 
the work of the eighth grade. In each test the teacher explained 
just what was important. A test covered one side of one
-P-A-G-E-263
CLASSROOM PRACTICES 231 
sheet of paper. Each problem was marked right or wrong 
and the per cent correct recorded by the children. The 
papers, not folded, were passed in such a manner that the 
teacher found them arranged alphabetically. They were 
recorded after school. 
It took the teacher only a few minutes each evening to 
record the grades. She had each test named, as “multi- 
plication of decimals,” “division of decimals,” ‘assembly 
and addition of decimals,” “the multiplication of fractions,” 
“the multiplication of a fraction by a compound number,” 
“the reduction of fractions,” etc. At the end of this week 
each child had been sounded so completely that the teacher 
had an estimate of his ability in every detail of the subject. 
Following this, during study periods, a series of confer- 
ences took place. The teacher called a child to her desk, 
asked him to bring his arithmetic notebook with him, and 
together they went over his case. There was no scolding. 
At this juncture a weakness was looked upon merely as a 
fact. His class standings in the combined tests with im- 
portant points in each one were given to the child. He was 
advised to work upon his weaknesses. 
Having thus thoroughly informed herself as to the capacity 
of each student this teacher reported that her work for the 
rest of the term was very much simplified. Also the posses- 
sion of a careful analysis, recorded in detail at the beginning 
of the term, furnished her with a basis for further estimates. 
She was now ready for the second stage in the work of grad- 
ing. A week was spent in studying the attitudes of the differ- 
ent children. Which ones did the reciting? What sort of 
recitation did each make? Recitations were classified as 
voluntary, called out by the teacher, and voluntary but not 
well considered (the child who is always willing to talk but 
never organizes his thoughts or never goes to the bottom of 
his subject). Where lack of preparation, inability to pre- 
 
-P-A-G-E-264
232 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
pare properly, or lack of codperation and interest were shown, 
the situation was recorded. The recording was done at the 
end of the recitation in a notebook made out with different 
headings. A definite plan of working through the class in a 
certain way each day helped in this. At the end of this 
week a large number of records of each child made it possible 
to have conferences with special individuals upon their daily 
attitudes and methods of work. In these conferences the 
records were used as a basis. 
The third stage in the work of grading was now possible. 
The teacher familiarized herself with the work of each child. 
This took some time, but it proved worth while, for during 
the rest of the term it made all the work much easier. Each 
day the class was divided into three groups (in the mind of 
the teacher, not in separate groups as to seating, etc.), those 
who did exceptionally well, those who failed, and those who 
went along as usual. Usual, however, now had a special 
significance. It meant in accordance with the carefully 
worked out estimate which had been mastered by the teacher. 
In the evening or at the end of the class period, a few records 
were made. It was possible to keep track of the work of 
the children without using the grade book in front of them 
because each new estimate was based upon full knowledge of 
past performance, and only changes for better or for worse 
were recorded. Changes occur in only a small per cent of the 
children of a class. When they do occur, they are not hard 
to keep in mind by one who is interested. No record meant 
no change. Thus a grade for each day was possible with 
very little effort, and grades never became the center of 
interest. 
The work of this teacher was known to be thorough. No 
one doubted that her estimates of the work of the children 
were accurate. She was very successful in getting results, 
and no child felt that he was working merely for a grade.
-P-A-G-E-265
  CLASSROOM PRACTICES 233 
The record of the teacher was used as a basis in fact for 
diagnosis and prescription. The report card furnished a 
periodic account or summary, but no child was surprised 
at his grades. 
If teachers realized how much easier it would make 
their work if they would attack it in so businesslike a 
manner, they would appreciate the fact that teaching, 
down to its most minute details, should be an art. 
Let us note some of the factors in this illustration. 
They are summarized as follows: 
1. Every detail was organized, even the method of 
handling the papers. They were not folded; only one 
side of one sheet was used for a test, and the method 
of passing ' them was planned so as to save time. The 
purely academic teacher ignores such details and, 
therefore, finds them waiting for him at every corner. 
Even when he boasts that he is above such things, he 
reveals an unconscious worry, for he realizes to himself 
that he is not efficient. 
2. A careful study was made at the beginning of the 
term. The teacher took the time at the initial stage 
to master the details in the work of each child. She 
found herself relieved of a great load by doing this. 
There is nothing more disheartening to a conscientious 
teacher than to find himself constantly in doubt con- 
cerning the work of his classes. When a careful study 
has once been made, the ease with which future es- 
1 These are not absolute. Other well-organized ways may be just as 
good,
-P-A-G-E-266
234 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
timates and suggestions may be made adds much to 
the pleasure of the work of teaching. 
3. Estimates were formed almost automatically 
after the basis had been established. This was due to 
the fact that a careful plan had been made. Time was 
saved and records were much more accurate and com- 
plete than those of many teachers who spend a great 
deal more time. 
4. The marks were used to detect weaknesses and 
as stimulation for better work. The private con- 
ference in such matters is a powerful factor. When 
based upon accurate knowledge, it is bound to make 
for better work as well as more wholesome relations 
between the teacher and the child. Like conferences 
with parents are also helpful. 
Going In and Going Out of the Classroom. — Even 
such a mechanical detail of school work as the passing 
in and going out of the classes is intelligently planned 
by superior teachers. They plan that it shall be done 
efficiently and teach the children to take full charge of 
themselves. An illustration in the words of a teacher 
will indicate how this has been done: 
“For years it has been a part of my plan to make the 
children responsible for an efficient method of passing in 
and out of the room and the school. I begin by discussing 
the matter with them. When they are asked to think it 
over and to suggest ways that might be feasible, the average 
class responds very readily. Before our discussion is over I 
always ask them whether or not they would like to take full
-P-A-G-E-267
  CLASSROOM PRACTICES 235 
charge of this matter and save themselves from being 
watched. I explain that they are big enough and intelligent 
enough to go and come without my seeing that they do not 
disturb any one. 
“We have worked out several schemes, and since I always 
allow considerable initiative, I never force my method upon 
them. Usually, however, if the plan the class has in mind 
is not desirable, I ask a few questions. This has always been 
sufficient to remodel the scheme satisfactorily. Two plans 
that were especially effective are: 
“1. Each child takes responsibility for himself. He may 
come into the room or go out in the way that seems best to 
him. Before this plan is begun, we always have a discussion 
of it, and the class takes the responsibility for suggesting 
better methods to children who cause disturbance. They 
are always made to understand that this responsibility may be 
assumed and kept only if they show that they are intelligent 
enough to merit it. Discussions of this and various like 
matters occur at intervals through the term. The class 
should lead at these times, as the feeling of responsibility 
is a factor in good morale. 
“2. Another scheme that is quite popular with the classes 
is to work out a method that will show good breeding. In 
one such plan at the ringing of the bell each child put his 
work in order and stood beside his desk. When all were 
standing, proper spacing followed. Then the last row 
marched out first, followed in turn by those next, and those 
nearest the door were last.” 
One of the most delightful solutions of this problem was 
seen in a primary room. In fact, many primary teachers 
have adopted similar plans. The teacher had trained the 
children to respond to chords on the piano. In the midst of 
their work she would strike a chord. Immediately every 
child put away his work and listened for the next signal. In
-P-A-G-E-268
236 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
accordance with its meaning they either marched out of the 
room in good order, marched around the room, danced, 
hopped, or jumped. They took great delight in being able 
to interpret the signals correctly. No doubt the music was 
a refreshing influence. 
In contrast to this wholesome and efficient scheme 
many primary teachers spend too much of their time 
lining up the children for different kinds of exercises. 
There are numerous other mechanics of daily routine. 
The way they are handled by successful teachers has 
been illustrated by those discussed. From the kinder- 
garten through theuniversity they are important. Often 
in institutions of higher learning such factors are so 
poorly handled as to be almost ruinous to good work. 
Here the academic mind pretends to be above details. 
There is only one way to rise above details, and that is to 
meet and master them. 
It seemed fitting and necessary to emphasize the 
foregoing factors of good teaching in this book. We 
have, to use our own expression, met them and at least 
have attempted to master them. Let us keep in mind 
the idea that we deal with them first of all in order to 
prevent them from interfering with the rest of our work. 
Good teachers utilize mechanical details as important 
tools in the larger scheme of developing children. 
SUMMARY IN SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE 
1. Teach to develop a constructive spirit. Keep in 
mind that this is essential for success in teaching and

at the same time is of world importance. When you 
develop a child’s morale you are doing service in the 
cause of modern civilization. 
2. Meet problems of discipline before they occur. 
Remember that morale is made up of hundreds of 
apparently insignificant influences. Work for morale 
and it will not be necessary to spend much time trying 
to catch “ bad” boys at their mischief. 
3. Make up your mind to ewcel in your everyday 
tasks. Do them so well that they will become a 
pleasure; eliminate drudgery. 
4. Make assets rather than liabilities of details. 
Seating, passing papers, grading, and marching in and 
out of the room, all furnish problems that must be met 
efficiently. Meet these issues before you try to apply 
more complex principles.

  CHAPTER XI 
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS 
The Necessity for Programs. —It is essential for 
the teacher who desires to improve to analyze every 
teaching problem with the plan of discovering a body 
of data upon which to base programs for improvement. 
If, for example, he wishes to improve the correctness 
of his everyday English, he must first of all make a 
study of his habitual errors, select about ten that are 
most prominent, and substitute a proper expression 
for each. His efforts for a period of time should be 
directed towards establishing the habit of employing 
proper phrases or expressions in the place of the ten 
habitual errors. Such a scheme is essential in the 
improvement of every phase of teaching. It may be 
possible to carry on a number of improvement pro- 
grams at once. 
Programs for the improvement of the teacher’s per- 
sonal appearance, disposition, and health; programs 
for improving school management, methods of teach- 
ing, and the selection and emphasis of subject matter ; 
programs for the improvement of the home life of the 
children, the relationship between the school and the 
home, and the play of’the children; and programs for 
the improvement of every phase of teaching: all com- 
239
-P-A-G-E-274
    240 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
bine to improve the process as a whole. Incidental or 
casual attempts bring little or no advancement. A 
gain in one place may be offset by a loss in another 
unless the teacher keeps in the background of his 
efforts a fairly complete plan which will insure progress. 
In this chapter illustrative programs are de- 
scribed. They are merely suggestive of numerous 
ways in which teachers may plan to grow. Teachers 
and prospective teachers are advised to make use of 
the ideas in these illustrations. The basic principles 
should first be assimilated. The plan should then be 
modified to fit local needs and conditions. 
ILLUSTRATIVE IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS 
A Background for Developing Class Morale. — A 
beginning teacher who showed interest in the subject 
of “ morale” as discussed in Chapter X was directed 
to observe the morale of the class of a superior sixth- 
grade teacher with the idea of making a program of 
the results observed toward which she could work 
in her own teaching. After a few weeks’ observation 
she reported the following “ impressions.”’ They are 
worth considering by any teacher who desires a back- 
ground for improvement in work of this type. 
1. There has been a procedure general enough to meet 
the arising needs and emergencies. Yet a definite lesson 
has always been planned. 
2. Moral standards are kept before the pupils to which 
they respond exceptionally well. They have a codperative 
pride as well as individual interest.
-P-A-G-E-275
  IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS 241 
3. They are feeling the value of honesty. 
4. All have poise, — true, some more than others, — but 
no one loses his head. 
5. The sixth grade is learning how to study as well as 
how to learn. 
6. They (the children) behave wonderfully well without 
having it “drilled into them.” 
7. They are very attentive. They are interested in 
their work. 
8. Their vocabulary is quite astonishing in many cases, 
and their good English is particularly noticeable. 
9. The attitude of the children toward the teacher stands 
out also. 
10. Children in the sixth grade seem to have been made 
exceptionally friendly and inclined to talk a great deal, which 
can be utilized in their school work. 
11. Children have developed knowledge of current events 
and a general interest in life. 
12. They have discovered the secret of all progress in 
school work — the need for knowledge. 
13. The pupils have learned to take responsibility for the 
group and their school. 
14. They are at almost all times courteous, cheerful, con- 
fiding, and enthusiastic. 
15. They are willing to listen to suggestions made by 
other children or by the teacher. 
A Program for Teaching Spelling. — The following 
program for the improvement of teaching spelling was 
made and successfully tried by a group of teachers. 
General: 1. The primary aim in spelling in the upper 
grades is to develop in the children a spelling consciousness. 
With children in these grades, this objective is best reached 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
  242 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
through the visual sense, but an approachisalso made through 
auditory and motor activity, for the children hear, see, pro- 
nounce, and write each word studied. 
2. Another important aim is economy of time. Why waste 
time on words the children already know? To effect this 
aim a preliminary test is given on the new words each day, 
and only those words with which the children have difficulty 
are taught. Weekly preliminary tests may be given. 
8. An effort is made to teach only those words which occur 
naturally in the mastery of the school arts, and are needed 
in written work. The true test of good spelling is its use in 
manuscript; obviously children need to spell only those 
words which occur in their writing vocabulary, compositions, 
and letters. 
4. Dictionary definitions are not required for words al- 
ready familiar, but pupils are encouraged to use this source 
for spellings and meanings. The latter are developed chiefly 
through context or in sentences about correlated subject 
matter. 
5. Only five new words are taught each day. Wilson 
says, “In spelling we have been hopelessly burdening the child 
in our attempts to teach 10,000 to 15,000 words, while the 
outside limit of an eighth-grade vocabulary is less than 5000 
words.”’ 
Specific: 1. The teacher has previously written on the 
board five sentences using new words. These sentences deal 
with subject matter used in other classes, and whenever 
possible meanings have been developed during some other 
recitation. 
2. James stands and reads sentence. He quickly calls 
on Mary for an original sentence. Mary: “Agriculture 
cannot be easily carried on in mountainous regions.”” Mary 
calls on Katie for another sentence. 
3. All five new words are developed in a similar way.
-P-A-G-E-277
  IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS 243 
4. A preliminary test is given on the five new words, the 
meanings of which were developed the preceding day. Chil- 
dren correct their own papers. 
5. Those who miss no words in test study something else 
or read at seats. 
6. Only those who miss words study spelling, and each 
studies only the words he misses. This effects economy 
of time. 
7. Teacher writes first word on board, not in syllables. 
Those who miss the word come to the board. 
8. Teacher pronounces and spells the word, stressing 
syllables. 
9. Children pronounce and spell word, stressing syllables. 
10. Children pronounce and spell the complete word. 
11. Pupils close eyes and visualize word. 
12. They look at it again. 
13. Word is erased and pupils spell again. 
14. Pupils write the word. Thus each pupil has seen, 
heard, pronounced, and written the word. 
15. The same method is used foreach word. 
16. After lesson has been taught, all concentrate for few 
minutes on all words. 
17. They then write eight or ten words, five old and five 
new. 
18. They correct their own papers. 
19. Each child keeps a list of words he misses for his own 
benefit and review. A twenty-word test is given each week, 
a fifty-word test each five weeks. Matches and review 
stimulate interest. Time given to spelling each day, fifteen 
minutes. 
A Program for the Improvement of Teaching Begin- 
ning Reading.— An experienced teacher interested 
in the improvement of the teaching of beginning read- 
 
-P-A-G-E-278
  244 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
ing after a series of conferences with persons who had 
received special training in this field read the following 
books : 
1. F. W. Dunn — Interest Factors in Primary Reading 
Material. Bureau of Publications, Teachers College, Colum- 
bia University. 
2. Nellie Cooper — How to Teach the Primary Grades.

5. F. T. Baker and A. H. Thorndike — Everyday Classics, 
Teachers’ Manual. Macmillan. 
6. W. T. Field — Teachers Manual for the Field Primer 
and First Reader. Ginn and Co. 
She then modified an outline of a superior teacher 
and made for herself the following program: 
1. The children should be divided into three groups. 
Group I comprises the brighter children who learn to read 
almost without instruction and who should not be required 
to take any drills in phonics but should be allowed to read 
ahead as fast as they desire to go. In Group II, made up of 
average children, there will be need for regular drills in phonics 
and the reading must be checked regularly by a plan to see 
that the child gets the thought from the printed page. Children 
of this type will make up the largest group. Group III will 
be made up of slow readers, mostly backward children; 
a great deal of drill and attention to different types of weak- 
ness will be essential in this group. 
The first step in this program is the diagnosis of the class 
in order to determine the members of these groups.
-P-A-G-E-279
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS 245 
2. Emphasis with all three groups should at first be put 
upon the thought-getting process. Until this habit is firmly 
established there should be no conscious effort on the part 
of the teacher to help the children with the phonic elements. 
8. If a child does not know a word, it should be told to 
him, or better, suggested to him through its connection with 
the content. 
4. If the child, however, during this early stage notices 
similarities between words, the work is halted for an instant 
and the attention of the class is focused upon the similarities. 
For example, on a certain pre-primer chart the word “made” 
came directly under the word “man.” A child noticed and 
spoke of the fact that the two words looked alike. He was 
asked what part of the words looked alike. In the rhymes 
and jingles used as pre-primer material, some child will fre- 
quently mention that certain words sound alike or rhyme. 
5. In accordance with an organized plan the children 
should be “allowed to discover” in their reading all the basic 
phonetic principles. After the habit of reading for thought 
is firmly established, when a child notices that the initial 
letters of certain words are the same, the work should be 
halted for a short time, and the words put upon the board. 
The child may pronounce them slowly, and find out what 
part of the words sound alike ; then the children think of other 
words that begin with the same sound. These are added to 
the list on the board. Frequently they will find the sound 
in their own names, as man, met, Margaret McMillan. Only 
a short time is necessary for this, but every occasion is used 
in the everyday work to note words which begin with such 
initial sounds, particularly unfamiliar words. It is in this 
way that the consonant sounds are developed, the easy ones 
first, as c, m, s, etc. The slow children who are not quick in 
noticing in their everyday work these similarities are given 
special training.
-P-A-G-E-280
246 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
6. Combinations of vowel and consonant sounds known 
in phonic systems as “families”? are developed in much the 
same way as the consonant sounds. A child in reading a 
certain story came to the word “bake,’’ which he did not 
know. He did, however, know the word “make.” The 
words were placed upon the board, their similarity noted, 
and the unknown word was easily pronounced. The chil- 
dren were then asked if they could think of any other words 
that sounded like “make” and “bake.” “Cake,” “rake,” 
“flake” were added. The teacher said, “I can think of 
something on which you might sail a boat, or in which you 
might fish or swim.’’ One child immediately gave “lake.” 
Again the attention of the children was drawn to the sim- 
ilarity of all the words, and the suggestion given that when- 
ever they saw “ake” in a word they would know how it 
sounded. 
7. No work should be done in the first grade to throw 
emphasis on difficult phonograms. Only the simple ones are 
taught, as at, in, en, ing. The teacher should be on the alert 
to have these phonograms appear, whenever possible, in 
new words. 
8. The children should be watched carefully, and if 
there is the slightest tendency to too much analysis, tending 
to slow down speed or hinder the getting of the thought, spe- 
cial emphasis should be put upon phrasing or word grouping. 
9. Most of Group I do not need phonic help, and their 
time should not be taken for it, but rather that time should 
be put upon fixing habits of thoughtful, intelligent reading. 
10. A child should, by the end of the first year, be familiar 
with the initial consonants and the easy combinations of 
vowels and consonants. 
11. A great deal of supplementary material should be 
provided so that there will be ample opportunity for rapid 
silent reading.

A Program for Improving the Mechanics of Class 
Management. — In Chapter III the necessity for the 
mastery of details was emphasized. Below is the 
report of a beginning teacher on the observation of the 
elements of class management in the work of a superior 
teacher. By making a background of these ten points 
improvement in class management may be brought 
about by many teachers who have difficulty in this 
phase of teaching. 
1. The children should take their places in a quiet, or- 
derly manner, as quickly as possible, but of their own 
initiative. 
2. A short, recess is given after every hour class, so 
that the children will not become so tired, as fresh air and 
play are as essential and fundamental to the child as school- 
room work. 
3. Courtesy should be insisted upon to both teachers 
and fellow pupils. 
4, Every one’s attention must be secured before proceed- 
ing with the lesson, as the child is likely to lose instructions, 
the repeating of which is a waste of time to the other children, 
causing inattention and loss of interest on their part. 
5. The personality of the teacher, her dress, and chil- 
dren’s friendliness with her, are important in securing the 
liking of and interest in school work. 
6. Without a good beginning, it is difficult to proceed 
well. The teacher must start her work with confidence, 
and show from the very first that she is capable of controlling 
the situation. 
7. Children should be allowed to ask as many intelligent 
questions as possible, encouraged to do so, and allowed to 
take charge of their work as much as they are capable of
-P-A-G-E-282
248 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
doing, as it develops the child much more than if the teacher 
is continually the dominating figure. 
8. The desks should be cleared, and pencils put away so 
the children will not have these to play with and become a 
source of inattention. 
9. The children who do not respond should be called 
upon often and encouraged to talk. 
10. Children are likely to become restless if the subject 
matter does not control their interest. 
Individual Analysis in a Test. — After giving a test 
the teacher should see that each individual is helped 
by an analysis of his answers to the questions of the 
teacher. Wherever possible some specific truth about 
the character of the child’s work should be conveyed 
to him. From time to time after the return of the 
papers the teacher may inquire of the child about 
how he is progressing in overcoming the weakness 
revealed in his latest test. The following is an illustra- 
tion of work of this type: 
IRENE: You failed on questions that related to class 
discussion. Advise you to be careful and 
note what goes on in class. 
Grorce: Be sure to study questions asked of you so that 
you will not misinterpret. Also be supplied 
with more concrete illustrations in your ob- 
servation study. 
Beatrice: A good paper. You would probably better study 
your text so as to have more points that you 
believe are worth keeping. 
Frep: Advise you to note what is going on in class as 
well as to be careful to answer questions as 
 
-P-A-G-E-283
  IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS 249 
asked. Your score here is probably acci- 
dental since your class recitations are very 
good. 
Mary: No directions necessary — your paper is best 
in class. 
Lxusiin: Study your text more. Be careful to answer 
questions just as asked. Note more of class 
discussion. 
Buancue: A very good paper. Your only weakness in 
this paper appears in partial failure on those 
questions answered in class discussions. Be 
careful to listen in class. 
Dorotuy: Suggest that you try a little harder. You lost 
at least ten points in this test by lack of effort. 
You show weakness on textbook as well as 
on material contributed in class discussion. 
A Program of Principles for Making or Interpreting 
a Course of Study. — The following principles should 
be made the heart of a course of study. They should 
be used in the selection of all the subject matter in 
all the subjects. A course of study must be more 
than an outline. A central feature should be ways 
and means of dealing with the subject matter that is 
to be taught. Therefore, at every step the teacher 
should feel that he is realizing some of the bigger 
principles, and every detail should be a definite part 
of the larger scheme. These must be used and illustrated 
with classroom procedure in all the different subjects. 
The following principles have been employed in making 
courses of study in several cities and in at least one 
state:
-P-A-G-E-284
  250 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
I. The teacher should always keep in mind four im- 
portant aims of education: 
(1) Health 
(2) Social-Civie 
(3) Vocational-Economic 
(4) Culture-Recreational 
If these are understood in a practical way the teacher will 
be working constantly to realize them. For illustration, 
she is likely to have hygienic rules about allowing children 
to be excused from classes — she is unlikely to keep children 
inside at recess — she will avoid worry and will give children 
sound advice about health matters at any time if she is 
working at all times for the health value. It will be the 
same with the other three values. A teacher who feels that 
these are a part of the course of study is sure to be a better 
teacher, and if these can be put over with a number of prac- 
tical illustrations at the beginning of the general course so 
that every teacher will feel that he is bound by them even 
more than he is bound to teach fractions and decimals, such 
course of study should be very helpful. 
II. The next fundamental principle that should be un- 
derstood is that of proper classifications of the different 
subjects : 
(1) We have the “ key”’ subjects (the three R’s and spelling) 
(2) The content subjects (geography, history, and so on) 
(3) The expression subjects (music, physical training, 
English composition, and the general civic social principles 
of the entire school). 
Of these the key subjects are basic and very important, but 
reading is by far the most important of all of these and silent 
reading much more important than oral reading: Penman- 
ship, spelling, and a reasonable mastery of the fundamentals 
of arithmetic should be completed by the end of the sixth 
or seventh grade. The teacher should understand that the
-P-A-G-E-285
  IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS 251 
key subjects are not ends in themselves, that they should 
usually be taught by lively and effective drill, not made 
burdensome, and, to go back to the first point, that reading 
(silent reading) is by far the most important of them all. 
The content subjects begin to be important in the fourth 
grade although they may form a general nucleus for interest 
before that time ; but from the fourth grade on there may be 
increases so that in the seventh and eighth grades content 
is a very important issue. 
Modern education looks upon the econ subjects 
and upon methods which employ expression on the part of 
the learners as the chief contribution of the twentieth century 
to the curriculum. Such phrases as a “thought without ex- 
pression is a thought without impression,” and the other, that 
we do not “learn” children or even teach them, but we teach 
children to learn, should be made basic in emphasizing the 
value of expression subjects. One may know how to write 
or spell very well and he may know thousands of facts from 
the content subjects, but if he is not able to use both of these 
abilities in the actual processes of living, that is in expression, 
they are of little value to him or to the world in general. 
III. The last general principle is that of the selection of 
subject matter. The teacher should understand that there 
are three types of subject matter on every topic that may be 
presented : 
(1). There is the cardinal-factor element of the subject, 
and this should be mastered absolutely. 
(2) There is the illustrative and transitory fact or ele- 
ment, which should be learned for the occasion or for the 
time being. 
(3) There is the useless subject matter. 
Frequently teachers emphasize useless subject matter 
more than the other two types. This is probably on account 
of the fact that there is more subject matter that is useless 
 
-P-A-G-E-286
252 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
than there is of the cardinal or transitory type. If one will 
observe the ordinary class and the subject matter as classi- 
fied in these three ways, one will readily see that much of the 
subject matter emphasized in the classroom could give way 
to material that is more useful. A course of study should 
emphasize and reémphasize these points. It should “pound, 
pound, pound” upon cardinal issues, and if these principles 
can teach teachers to discriminate, they will be doing a won- 
derful service. 
A Program for Introducing the Project Method. — 
This program was made by a young teacher who had 
taken her practice teaching under a supervisor who was 
especially successful with projects. She secured a 
position under a progressive superintendent who ad- 
vised her that he would appreciate some good project 
work providing it were not “ one-sided ”’ or too “‘ spec- 
tacular.” At the advice of the writer she read the 
following books and magazine articles as a background 
for her plan: The Project Method by J. A. Stevenson ; 
The Elementary School Curriculum by F. G. Bonser ; 
Methods of Teaching in Elementary Schools by S. C. 
Parker; The Project Method by J. L. Stockton; and 
articles on the project for two years back in The 
Teachers College Record and The Elementary School 
Journal. 
After thus reading she made the following program: 
1. Keep in mind at all times the different big principles 
expressed in the definitions found in the writings of Kilpatrick, 
Charters, and Stevenson, complete educative experience, natural 
setting, organized activities with a purpose, and pupil-initiative.
-P-A-G-E-287
  IMPROVEMENT PROGRAMS 253 
2. Make this work establish habits of independence. All 
projects must represent the work of the children. 
3. Projects should establish the habit of asking intelligent 
questions. It is hoped that one result will be a desire on the 
part of the children for knowledge that will help them carry 
on their projects. 
4, Longer and better organized individual recitations 
should be another result. 
5. The children should learn how to use books in finding 
information, the textbook as well as reference books. Wide 
reading is expected. 
6. Individual differences are to be taken advantage of 
and children with special talents will be allowed to bring them 
to bear in making a success of the projects. 
7. Better work in the school subjects should result. 
Presumably the children will work more diligently in the 
mechanics of arithmetic, writing, spelling, in order to be able 
to do the “technical work” necessary to success in projects. 
8. Effective English expression, courtesy, codperation, 
accurate arithmetical calculations, perfect spelling in all 
signs or directions on projects, accurate geographical and 
historical knowledge, all these will play a part. 
9. First project, ‘Columbus the Central Figure of a Great 
Age.” Plan to spend six weeks on Columbus, using the ideas 
enumerated above.! 
Summary IN SUGGESTIONS FoR PRACTICE 
1. Upon deciding to improve some phase of teaching, 
be sure to make a thorough study of the issues in- 
volved, also read widely in the literature of the subject 
1See Unit Plan in Chapter IX, also seventh-grade plan in English,

and make a complete program to guide you and to 
remind you of the many sides of your problem. 
2. Make sure that you have the right principles 
to go by, then continue in your determination to im- 
prove. Change devices and details but keep to the 
basic principles. 
3. The teacher who would improve should have a 
number of such programs and refer to them frequently. 
4. Do not forget that one-sided enthusiasm without 
careful study and planning as a preliminary is not 
likely to result in the improvement of any phase of 
teaching. 
5. Note especially that most of the programs sug- 
gested in this chapter contain general principles as 
well as plans for their execution.

    CHAPTER XII 
A CROSS SECTION OF A GROWING SCHOOL 
A Description orf THE ScHOOL 
Tue school taken for illustration here is located in a 
city of about 60,000 population. In general the spirit 
of the entire school system is excellent. The work 
of this school is taken because it is typical of the best. 
Any one of a hundred growing schools could have been 
described here and the principles illustrated would have 
been the same. 
Some points worth mentioning about the school are: 
1. An atmosphere of achievement was noticeable 
throughout. 
2. There was a quiet restfulness about the work. 
There was no unnecessary flurry or worry. 
3. Codperation between teachers and principal and 
between these two and the children was evident. 
4. Teachers and principals recognized deficiencies 
with a determination to eliminate them as far as possible. 
This created a spirit of progress. 
5. Criticism was invited, but the teachers and the 
principal knew enough to disregard purely destructive 
criticism.

An important advantage from the standpoint of 
illustration is that this is not a private school. It is one 
of the great American public schools, not ideal but 
ideally practical; a place where boys and girls receive 
training and undergo experiences that will make good 
citizens of them; not a perfect school, but one like 
most other schools in the problems it must meet and 
solve, yet learning to solve them better as it grows. 
Wuat THE Recrtations INDICATE 
Modern Methods More Fully Explained. — The 
recitations described in this chapter will serve to explain 
modern methods in a better way than any amount of 
descriptive language can do. Ordinary public school 
teachers in a public school system conducted every 
one of them. They had to undergo all the difficulties 
ordinarily met by the average teacher; i.e., large 
classes, an ordinary course of study, peculiar and 
backward pupils, parents who sometimes failed to 
comprehend the value of what was being done, and other 
drawbacks as numerous as are found in an average 
school. 
In considering such elements as scientific drill, moti- 
vation, appreciation of relative values, initiative by 
pupils, teacher in the background, the selection of 
valuable subject matter for emphasis, codperation, 
organization, exercise in thinking, intelligent questions 
asked by children and teacher, and a number of other 
important factors of modern teaching, it is hoped that
-P-A-G-E-294
  258 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
these illustrations with the comments will serve as a 
background for the practice of the reader. We have 
a cross-section of a modern school in action together 
with comments by the principal of the school and by the 
author. 
The Growth of the School. — The work of the school 
used for illustration was not always so much in accord 
with modern methods and ideals as it is now. It 
developed through years of effort on the part of the 
principal and the teachers. When they began, it 
was impossible to carry on work of the type described 
here. At first the children did not know what to do 
when left to themselves, as in some of the recitations 
taken for illustration. From the comments of the 
principal it is obvious that they are still working upon 
the problem of improvement. This should encourage 
anyone who wishes to improve. In fact, the reason the 
principal and the teachers have been able to improve 
so much is that they have worked with the intention of 
making progress even when they knew that many dif- 
ficulties stood in the way of ever attaining perfection. 
Comments of the Principal. — After the description 
of each recitation will be found the comments of the 
principal. The principal is a woman who has taken the 
pains to keep in contact with educational literature, has 
taken summer courses in education, and has tried 
conscientiously to realize in her school the best ideals 
she could get. 
Her comments should be read carefully. They can
-P-A-G-E-295
  CROSS SECTION OF A GROWING SCHOOL 259 
be approved in every way by one who knows modern 
educational ideals and is interested in seeing them made 
use of in teaching. It will be noted that she does not 
approve of everything that is done. Deficiencies, 
however, are not always laid at the door of the teacher. 
We find in these comments an intelligent, practical, and 
useful discussion that should help every teacher who is 
in earnest about the improvement of his work. 
How to Make Use of the Illustrations in Improving 
Teaching. — After reading the descriptions of these 
recitations, the comments of the principal of the school, 
and those of the author, the teacher who wishes to make 
use of the ideas should carefully consider them in re- 
lation to his own school. He may find that a recitation 
which worked splendidly in the school taken for illus- 
tration turns out to be a failure when tried by himself. 
In such a case some existing condition has not been 
dealt with properly. 
It is also well to keep in mind that it is not wise to 
try to do exactly the same thing in the same way 
throughout as it was done in one of the illustrations. 
First of all the central ideas must be assimilated. Then 
application will result in a number of different ways all 
of which approach the model and many of which may 
be superior to it. 
It is very important that the reader fully comprehend 
the terms used by the principal in criticizing. When it 
was mentioned that a teacher was properly in the back- 
ground, a situation that is very hard to achieve had 
 
-P-A-G-E-296
260 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
been attained. In another place mention is made of 
the fact that “‘ teachers who have taught for some time 
find it most difficult to put themselves in the back- 
ground.” Child initiative, codperation, and motiva- 
tion are other terms used frequently in the evaluation 
of recitations. The teachers evidently understood the 
practical significance of such terms. 
3 B Reaping DRAMATIZATION 
Assignment: Story of “Wolf, Wolf!” Text: Dramatic 
Reader. This lesson was given for the purpose of testing 
the value of group work. 
Teacher assigned lesson with only a few words of explana- 
tion and sent six pupils — number required to dramatize 
story — into hall to study, where they “acted out” the 
parts. No supervision was provided other than that given 
by a “leader” appointed by the teacher. 
The following day the principal was invited in to see the 
result. Pupils took their places in front of room, without 
any suggestion whatever from the teacher, and with remark- 
able ease and freedom dramatized this story of over two pages 
in length, giving the thought in their own words, although 
in some cases exact words of book were used. 
The “audience,” which in this case happened to be the 
entire room, although the “other class” was supposed to 
be studying, was intensely interested. In order to improve 
certain “rough spots”’ the teacher and principal asked pupils 
to repeat the reading. Perhaps there was not a great deal 
of value in repeating, but they felt that it might help to im- 
prove the dramatization in the next lesson which another 
group of pupils were expected to give in the course of the 
next day or two.
-P-A-G-E-297
  CROSS SECTION OF A GROWING SCHOOL 261 
Comments of Principal. — The results in this lesson 
seemed to prove to both teacher and principal the great 
value of group work, especially when the group had 
greater freedom for studying than could be given in a 
room where another class was reciting.’ 
Splendid opportunity for development of initiative 
was provided in this recitation. Each pupil was 
allowed to play his own part with but few suggestions 
from the teacher. Organization, also, had been taken 
care of — each pupil had to know when his “ turn ” 
came, place where he should stand in relation to other 
pupils in order to make play most effective, etc. Se- 
lection of subject matter was good, although there might 
be some question in regard to that point. The motive 
on the part of pupils probably came from the love which 
all children have for “ acting.” 
The teacher was scarcely in evidence during the reci- 
tation, although she was “ on the job ” every moment 
of the time. The fact that only six pupils participated 
in this recitation might be criticized, but that could very 
easily be overcome by sending more groups to the hall 
to study the same selection, and having each group 
recite — if time would permit. 
Further Comments. — Here we have an illustration 
of a type of work that approaches the ideal. The fact 
that the children could go out of the room and be 
trusted to do a good piece of work without any sur- 
veillance by the teacher was an indication that she was, 
1 See chapter on “Teacher in the Background.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  262 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
indeed, ‘‘ on the job ” as the principal expressed it. A 
teacher who can send children outside and be confident 
that they will do good work has attained something 
very worth while. Some teachers fail here and report 
that it is entirely a matter of the type of children that 
happen to make up the class. Both the teacher and the 
principal in the above case maintain that such work is 
possible with the majority of children after they have 
been trained for a short time.

First pupil was called upon by teacher to recite upon first 
topic. He passed to map at front of room and gave a brief 
talk on the history of the settlement of South Africa at same 
time locating places on map as he talked. At close of his 
recitation he called for “Remarks.” Instantly half of the 
number of pupils in the class were on their feet ready with 
questions and suggestions. Some of the questions he was 
unable to answer — these were answered by pupils who asked 
them. If he was not able to answer the question to the 
satisfaction of the pupil who had just recited on the topic, 
the matter was referred to another pupil or to the teacher ; 
she, however, in almost every case, assigned the topic to 
some one to “look up” the next day. EL ete di hh
-P-A-G-E-299
  CROSS SECTION OF A GROWING SCHOOL 263 
After the first topic was disposed of to the satisfaction of 
the class the second one on “Farming” was taken up. This 
led to a discussion on the different kinds of farms — cattle, 
sheep, goat, and ostrich — which showed that pupils had 
gathered a great deal of information from outside sources. 
(Carpenter’s Africa had been used, The Book of Knowledge, 
an encyclopedia, and about ten books which the teacher 
had brought from her own library.) 
The third topic on “‘Ostriches” led to a lively discussion 
on size and strength of bird, size of eggs, value of feathers, etc. 
One pupil in his remarks became somewhat aggressive — al- 
most impolite—in asking and answering questions. Teacher 
had to stop recitation for a moment to remind pupils that 
they must remember always to observe politeness. A few 
other timely remarks were thrown in, such as keeping tothe 
point, speaking loud enough to be heard by entire class, using 
good judgment in regard to kinds of questions asked, etc. 
The three remaining topics were disposed of in much the 
same manner, each one bringing forth splendid discussion, 
showing that pupils had spent much time and thought on the 
subject. Each one seemed eager and anxious to recite, and 
the entire class was alive and alert. It was noted, however, 
that boys’ questions and answers were much more definite 
and to the point than the girls’.! 
Principal’s Evaluation. — We are doing a great deal 
of work of this type in our building and are finding it 
very profitable and interesting. It seems to stimulate 
individual effort to an unusual degree, and brings forth 
an initiative and interest that is never seen in the 
old formally conducted recitation. Pupils are taught 
thoughtfulness and consideration for each other’s rights — 
1See chapter on “Improvement through Socialization.”
-P-A-G-E-300
  264 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
are taught to organize their thoughts definitely — to ask 
intelligent questions — to choose only good material — 
ability to express themselves before an audience — and 
many other things that are of vital concern in their lives 
outside of the school. We believe this training will 
“carry over.” A lesson like this should be seen to be 
appreciated — it is impossible to make a reader feel 
the spirit of it, the most important thing, after all, in 
the lesson. 
Further Remarks. — Every teacher who reads this 
will do well to note carefully the principal’s evaluation. 
It is to meet such needs that the socialized recitation 
was designed. Many teachers will find that time may 
be profitably spent in this way if they focus upon the 
six or seven definite purposes italicized above. 
The part played by the teacher in this recitation is 
worth special consideration. She was in the back- 
ground most of the time, but on one occasion she took 
charge long enough to impress upon the class the special 
points for which they were working. When one of the 
boys became too aggressive, the teacher showed what 
her part in a socialized recitation might be. 
It should also be noted that this was a review lesson. 
Such work is usually more profitable in review work. 
It is possible for ordinary classes to come nearer to the 
realization of the fundamental aims of this type of 
socialization when they work with materials that are 
more or less familiar. The teacher who is beginning 
socialized recitations will do well to keep this idea in
-P-A-G-E-301
  CROSS SECTION OF A GROWING SCHOOL 265 
mind. After the class has been trained in “‘ thoughtful- 
ness for each other, organization, intelligent questioning, 
the choice of only good material, and the ability to express 
themselves before an audience” they may do very well 
with advanced materials. 
6 B GrocRAPHY 
Assignment: National Parks. Class had been divided into 
groups of three or four pupils each, each group studying one 
park. This was the fifth day they had been studying projects. 
Pupil was called upon by teacher to recite upon her topic 
“Glacier Park.” She stepped to front of the room with a 
handful of illustrated literature, and a few notes written upon 
abit of paper. She commenced reciting by passing to a large 
railroad map and showing location of park. This was fol- 
lowed by a brief history. She next selected a postcard folder 
from her handful of material and showed the class many 
interesting and beautiful pictures. These had an added 
interest when she stated that her uncle had taken them when 
he was employed as photographer for one of the railroads. 
Next she selected a government bulletin from which she 
quoted and showed pictures. She closed the recitation by 
quotations and pictures from The Mentor. 
This was followed by another recitation by a different 
pupil, on the same park. About the same procedure was 
followed except that second pupil had found information 
from other sources, Book of Knowledge, railroad folders, and 
library books. 
The two recitations were followed by a discussion of 
glaciers in which the whole class participated, each pupil 
being allowed to stand without raising hand. None in class 
seemed to be able to explain satisfactorily how snow became
-P-A-G-E-302
  266 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
ice ina glacier. The matter was left over until the next day, 
the teacher suggesting that the pupils do some reading rela- 
tive to the topic. 
The assignment for following days was further study on 
parks — teacher asked three pupils to be ready to report. 
Class was then told to form into groups for study — each 
group being allowed the privilege of going to halls or staying 
in room as it preferred. About half remained in room. 
The principal visited room again the next day and found 
class following the same procedure as the day before, a dif- 
ferent park, however, being studied. The matter of glaciers, 
which had been left over from the day before, was satisfac- 
torily disposed of. 
Comments of Principal. — The selection of subject 
matter in this geography lesson was worthy of study: 
parks are of vital interest to every one, especially 
children. Motivation, therefore, had been provided 
for. Pupils had developed initiative as evidenced in 
their reading at the library, in reference books at school 
and at homes. Some pupils had gone to railroad offices 
to get folders, etc. 
Lesson was well organized — shown in group work — 
all pupils in class being called upon to ‘‘ report ”’ before 
the study of project was complete; each pupil being 
allowed to enter into general discussion at close of each 
recitation. Judgment of relative values was pro- 
vided for, also; in studying reference books pupils 
were expected to choose most valuable points, reject 
others. Teacher kept herself in background, saying 
no more than was necessary to guide the class.

Further Comments. —We have here a socialized 
recitation devoted to advanced rather than review 
materials. A chief factor in the scheme of socializa- 
tion was the report, which was to bring to the class 
something that had not already been studied. One 
difficulty in such work is the provision of something 
to do for all those who do not report. In the above 
recitation this could have been accomplished by re- 
quiring each child to furnish a few intelligent questions 
about the parks. These could be asked during the 
discussion. With text and reference books at hand 
each member of the class could be required to know 
all the general basic features of the topic to be discussed, 
while the one selected to make the report is stimulated 
by being told that he must bring something special 
and must go more deeply into the topic than ordinary 
study and recitation would require. 
The comments of the principal indicate that the re- 
ports were well up to standard. This is another im- 
portant point. Classes that have not been trained for 
such work are likely to respond in a slovenly manner. 
It will take time and work on the part of the teacher to 
develop children to the place where they will bring in 
well-organized reports that show careful preparation. 
In many classes where such work is attempted the 
pupil who “ reports ” merely brings in a few facts copied 
from an encyclopedia; and often no report at all is 
made, the pupil merely explaining that he ‘“ couldn’t 
find anything” upon the topic. The teacher must
-P-A-G-E-304
  268 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
know the individuals in his class and utilize references 
and make suggestions accordingly. 
5TH GRADE — PuysicaAL TRAINING 
Lesson given by physical training supervisor. 
Teacher had been asked by supervisor to take pupils to 
girls’ playroom, where physical training lessons were being 
given that particular morning. Boys and girls had been 
arranged in couples, according to height before leaving class- 
room. As soon as they reached playroom supervisor asked 
them to form a circle, by couples, around the outside of the 
room, making a “‘wheel,’’ as she called it. She then “halted” 
pupils and told them they were going to learn a new game 
that morning called “The Jolly Miller,’ and asked them to 
repeat the following lines: 
Happy is the miller who lives by the mill, 
The mill goes around with a right good will, 
One hand in the hopper and the other in the sack, 
The girls go forward and the boys turn back. 
In order to play this game supervisor explained that one 
extra boy would be needed for center of wheel. Fortunately 
there happened to be one boy without a partner, who was used 
for that purpose. She further explained to them that as the cir- 
cle or “wheel” started to move forward the words of the above 
rhyme were to be repeated. At the suggestion in the last line 
the boys “turned back,”’ thus causing them to go in the oppo- 
site direction to girls. The rhyme was again repeated — on 
the last line the boys again “turned back,” each one, includ- 
ing the one in the center, making an effort to get a partner. 
Right here was the place where intense interest was displayed 
in the game. No boy wanted to be left without a partner, 
and much excitement resulted from choosing. Of course
-P-A-G-E-305
  
CROSS SECTION OF A GROWING SCHOOL 269 
one boy was always “‘left”’ — this caused much good-natured 
fun and laughter. 
The rhyme was repeated from time to time as explained 
above. 
Comments of Principal. — This lesson seemed to 
provide greater opportunity for the development of 
initiative than most lessons given in physical training. 
Much of the work is very formal and gives no oppor- 
tunity for such development. 
Motivation, too, had been provided for. 
Lesson was well-organized, each child understood 
definitely what he was expected to do. 
After a short explanation at beginning of lesson the 
supervisor was ‘‘ absorbed’ by game — she, as well as 
the teacher and principal, played game with children. 
This caused much merriment. 
Further Comments. — This is an ordinary, well- 
planned lesson in physical training. It is reported 
here in order to emphasize the fact that in this school 
some regular work in physical training is given in ad- 
dition to the recess periods. The informality of the 
lesson is indicated by the comments of the principal. 
From these, one may also get a glimpse of her ideal 
for this work. Keep in mind that this is a fifth-grade 
lesson. Here we have the beginnings of codpera- 
tion. The individual games of the lower grades must 
now gradually give way to those in which we find 
more ‘‘give and take.” This is a good transitional 
game.

4TH GRADE ARITHMETIC 
Lesson in Long Division. — Teacher dictated simple prob- 
lems in long division to pupils seated at desks, at same time 
writing problem, herself, on board. A child was called upon 
to give following “formula,” other children, and teacher at 
board, working with her, placing down figures, as she did, etc. 
63 
21/1323 
126. 63 
“Two goes into 13 six times. We shall see if 21 goes into 132 
six times. Six times one is six, six times two is twelve. Yes, 
it will go six times. Write down the six above the two, 
multiply, subtract. My remainder is smaller than my di- 
visor. Check the 3 and bring it down. Two goes into 6 
three times. We shall see if 21 goes into 63 three times — 
three times 1 is three, three times 2 is six. Yes, it will go 
three times. Write the three above the three, multiply, 
subtract. My quotient is 63. I have the right number of 
figures in it because I have one more than I have checked.” 
Other pupils, in turn, were called upon to work similar 
problems from same formula — all children following and 
doing actual work at seats. This was the sixth day pupils 
had been doing such work, and almost all of the pupils seemed 
to be able to give “formula” intelligently, and at the same 
time work problems with some degree of ease and speed. 
Five pupils, out of a class of twenty-four, had all of the prob- 
lems correct, twelve had all but one, and only one had none 
right. 
At the end of the following week the principal again visited 
the room and found following results on similar problems — 
by this time “formula” had been dispensed with: Twenty 
in a class of twenty-eight had all correct, six had one incor-
-P-A-G-E-307
  CROSS SECTION OF A GROWING SCHOOL 271 
rect, and two had two incorrect. At the end of the third 
week another visit was made, at which time much more diffi- 
cult problems were given, and following results were noted : 
In class of twenty-six, eighteen had all correct, six had one 
incorrect, one had four, and one had six. 
Comments of Principal. — When the principal made 
the first visit to the room and found pupils giving a 
“ stereotyped formula ”’ she felt that it could not bring 
good results, but, after observing for several weeks, 
concluded that she would have to change her mind. 
The children were alive and alert to different steps in 
the process and worked long division with keen enjoy- 
ment. This teacher used the same method of teaching 
division last year, and the principal has noted, with in- 
terest, that pupils who have been taught by her method 
are much stronger in long division than those who have 
come from another room, taught by another method 
and without the above “ formula.” 
Further Comments. — Here we have an illustration 
of drill upon elements that are entirely mechanical. 
There is only one way of doing long division (or, at least, 
we should teach only one way, for there would be no 
advantage in taking up the time of the children in 
teaching them several ways of doing something that 
is purely mechanical). The teacher in the above reci- 
tation used the best means she could devise to im- 
press upon the entire class the easiest and best method. 
Everybody must learn long division. There are scores 
of similar processes, all purely mechanical, that should  
-P-A-G-E-308
  272 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
be learned as early in life as good results can be ob- 
tained. This is no time for discussion, ‘“ socialized reci- 
tations,” problems, or projects. It is a time for short 
but intensive drills. As is reported in the above case, 
children usually like such work. It is only when too 
much of the work of the school is purely mechanical 
that children rebel. 
The above lesson in the midst of so much good work 
of the opposite type furnishes a fine illustration of a 
situation that is truly modern. Modern educational 
thinkers believe in drill and training of a purely mechani- 
cal nature. They demand a sufficient proportion of this 
type of work to insure adequate results in all the mechani- 
cal elements of the curriculum. These mechanics are 
essential as a basis for initiative, organization, or appre- 
ciation. There may be better ways of teaching long di- 
vision than the one described here, but every good 
method must be based upon the idea that this is a 
mechanical element in the curriculum and must be 
mastered by drill. Some few teachers who have the 
modern spirit fail here because they do not keep in mind 
the necessity for such drill. However, we must not 
forget that all drill work is only a means to an end. 
When the child reaches the point where he can write, 
spell, and perform the mechanical operations in arith- 
metic in a way that will satisfy the demands of modern 
life, he need not spend further time in drill. Thus it 
is recognized as a valuable and fundamental element 
in modern teaching, but only the antiquated teacher
-P-A-G-E-309
CROSS SECTION OF A GROWING SCHOOL 273 
spends all or the majority of his school time in this type 
of work. 
47H GrapE — Socrauizep Reapine Lesson 
Selection. — “‘ Kittykin, and the Part She Played in the 
Great War,” by Thomas Nelson Page. 
Teacher had written following questions on board : 
1. When was Thomas Nelson Page born? 
2. Describe his home. 
3. What war broke out when Thomas Nelson Page was 
eight years old? 
4. Tell what you can of his life after he grew up. 
Teacher called on boy in class to recite on first two topics. 
He stepped to front of room and made a very interesting reci- 
tation — one that showed he had probably done some outside 
reading. After finishing he called for “remarks.” On the 
instant three-fourths of the number of pupils in the class 
were on their feet ready to ask questions of him. Most of 
the questions were intelligent and to the point, although a 
few showed lack of thought — some a braggadocio spirit. 
As soon as pupil who had asked question had it answered 
satisfactorily, he seated himself. This continued around the 
class until all who had questions to ask were satisfied. In 
case the pupil who was conducting the lesson could not an- 
swer the question he very politely said, ‘I do not know, will 
you please tell me.”” The one who asked the question then 
answered, receiving a very polite “Thank you” in return. 
In case a question was not answered satisfactorily the matter 
was referred to the teacher. 
This continued until all the topics had been recited upon. 
Pupils were next asked to open their books and read si- 
lently the first three paragraphs of the selection ‘“Kittykin,”’ 
which they had not read before.  
-P-A-G-E-310
    274 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
Pupil was called upon to tell — in front of class always — 
what he had read. The same procedure followed as just 
described for recitation topics. 
About half of the lesson was read silently, the other half 
orally, children constantly asking intelligent questions of 
each other. 
Comments of Principal. — According to McMurry, 
this surely would be classified as a lesson on the 
“higher” plane. Motivation, consideration of rela 
tion values, organization, initiative, all had been taken 
care of in socialized work. 
Further Comments. — In this recitation we have an 
illustration of a serious defect that had escaped the 
notice of both the teacher and the principal. The 
four questions upon which the study was to be based 
represent the poorest type of selection. Details about 
the author are at best only of secondary importance, 
while knowledge such as the date of his birth is entirely 
worthless. 
The lesson is given here to illustrate that in a school 
where work of the highest type is being done and in a 
lesson for which the general plan is excellent, some 
important factor may be neglected, the result being a 
decidedly inferior performance.t 
47H GRADE — LANGUAGE 
Rapid drill in correction of language errors — 
Teacher — “I’ve saw the bluebirds.” 
Pupil—“‘ Wrong. I have seen the bluebirds.”” 
1See Chapter II on “Developing a Point of View.”
-P-A-G-E-311
CROSS SECTION OF A GROWING SCHOOL 275 
Teacher — ‘It is I.” 
Pupil — “Right. It is I.” 
A number of such expressions were given in rapid succes- 
sion to pupils, each being expected to answer instantly. 
In the next exercise teacher asked pupils to play they were 
birds and requested them to make sentences using the word 
“shall” twice in the same sentence. Such as the following 
were given: 
“T shall be a robin and shall sing you a song.” 
“T shall be a duck and shall swim.” 
In third exercise one pupil was asked to stand in front of 
the class blindfolded ; one of the pupils at seat was told to 
touch him. Class then asked “Who touched you?” Blind- 
folded pupil then replied by saying, “John did it.” 
Reply by class — ‘No, John did not touch you.” 
The guessing was repeated until right pupil was found. 
In fourth exercise two girls were chosen to play telephone. 
First Girl — “Is this you, Virginia?” 
Second Girl — “Yes, it is I.” 
First Girl — “Was that your Mother who just passed our 
house?”’ 
Second Girl — “Yes, it was she.” Etc., etc. 
In fifth exercise all pupils were asked to “hide their eyes.” 
Teacher tapped the bell and asked them to guess who had 
rung it. “Ted has rung the bell.” 
Answer — “No, Ted has not rung the bell.” Etc., ete. 
Comments of Principal.— Pupils evidently had 
had some drill on these exercises, for only two errors 
were made in all games played. Whether right ex- 
pressions thus drilled upon will “ carry over” into life 
seems to be a question about which there is some differ- 
ence of opinion. In our building we are doing a great 
 
-P-A-G-E-312
276 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
deal of such drilling and are finding that children are 
becoming very sensitive to wrong expressions. The 
play spirit permeated the exercises, thus creating an 
enthusiasm and interest which was delightful to see. 
Lesson was splendidly organized. Opportunity for 
initiative and originality was provided; each child 
seemed to understand definitely what he was expected 
to do; pupils were in foreground throughout reci- 
tation ; teacher in background. 
Further Comments. — Such drill as is illustrated 
here should make up a large part of the language work 
in the lower grades. Whether or not the teacher may 
purposely use incorrect English before the children 
is a disputed question. After observing a great deal 
of such work it appears that there is little likelihood 
of negative suggestion. It is, of course, best to avoid 
very much incorrect expression. In the above lesson 
there is a good balance. 
2p GRADE — ARITHMETIC

nations such as -9-5~7, etc., placed on board — ten in all. 
Previous to beginning lesson teacher had all pupils stand at 
seats and play a singing game with a great deal of action in 
it. Children enjoyed rest and were put in right frame of 
mind for more serious study. Teacher passed to board, 
drew a shoe, at the same time made a laughing remark about 
“The old woman who lived in the shoe,” etc. Evidently 
game had been played before because children seemed to know 
 
-P-A-G-E-313
CROSS SECTION OF A GROWING SCHOOL 277 
that their names would be placed in the shoe if all combina- 
tions were given correctly ‘‘the first time around.” 
Teacher, with pointer in hand, called on first pupil to stand 
and give the ten combinations. Each pupil, in turn, was 
called upon until entire class had been given an opportunity 
to recite. One half of the number in a class of twelve gave 
combinations without hesitation, four were somewhat hesi- 
tating, and two failed to get name in “shoe.” Those pupils 
who hesitated and failed had initials placed under combina- 
tions, thus reminding them that they would be called upon 
again to give those particular combinations. Whenever any 
child had difficulty in giving answers to a combination at 
once, teacher asked pupil to study certain family numbers 
which she had placed on tag board and tacked to wall. 
She then asked all pupils to give all combinations several 
times in concert. These two plans seemed to help pupils 
who had “missed.’”’ One of the two pupils who failed the 
first time, when called upon again did so well that her name 
was placed in “shoe.” The other one who failed — a little 
colored boy — did not seem to profit through drill. Those 
who were hesitating had improved greatly. 
Comments of Principal. — There was not much op- 
portunity to judge of selection of subject matter in 
above lesson — subtraction is something that must be 
taught. The immediate motives could probably be 
summed up in the following : 
(1) Desire to get name in shoe 
(2) Approbation of teacher and principal 
(8) Desire to get correct answers to combinations 
It is difficult for children in this grade to grasp remote 
motives. The lesson was splendidly organized — shown
-P-A-G-E-314
278 THE IMPROVEMENT OF TEACHING 
by fact that work had been placed on board before 
school — each combination was somewhat more diffi- 
cult than preceding one —every pupil called upon 
| to recite — thorough drill given to those who did not 
recognize combination — “family ” cards on walls, 
etc., etc. Perhaps the teacher might have brought the 
children into the foreground somewhat more by socializ- 
ing the recitation. Principal suggested that she give 
some time to Whitney’s Socialized Recitation. Prin- 
cipal is finding that it is a most difficult matter for 
teachers who have taught many years to place them- 
selves in the background and the children in the fore- 
ground. 
Further Comments. — As mentioned by the princi- 
pal, the chief defect in the above lesson was found in 
the fact that each child recited individually to the 
teacher while the rest were idle. This could be over- 
come by organizing the entire class to observe and cor- 
rect mistakes. The final statement of the principal 
is well worth considering. 
GENERAL OBSERVATION 
The elements of teaching and the improvement of 
teaching as represented by these recitations described 
and criticized by the principal of the school illustrate 
many of the factors explained in detail in preceding 
chapters. In the eight recitations, thinking, initiative, 
drill, socialized recitations, yeaa in the background, 
intelligent questions by the children, and the modern 
   
-P-A-G-E-315
CROSS SECTION OF A GROWING SCHOOL 279 
point of view are illustrated in regular classroom ex- 
periences. In addition we have the comments of a 
principal who is working with the teachers, trying to 
improve their work. 
I have on file illustrations from over a hundred dif- 
ferent schools where work similar to that considered 
here is being done. There is developing over the coun- 
try a fine spirit of growth and improvement. Some 
of the things accomplished by sixth grades in these 
schools are almost beyond belief. Between the writ- 
ing of these lines an observation was made of a sixth- 
grade pageant, “A Dream of Peace,” written, staged, 
costumed, announced, and presented by a sixth-grade 
class. The ideas, attitudes, evidences of appreciation 
of world problems, and technical knowledge displayed 
were equivalent to the work of a group of talented 
and trained adults, and, throughout, it was obvious 
that the work was that of children taught by a superior 
teacher who at all times remained in the background. 
Such work is nation building. It suggests to the ob- 
server that no one has as yet fully realized the power 
of education when the art and science of teaching are 
fully appreciated by the teachers of the entire nation.

4, Train the children in your classes so that they 
can go out of doors or into the hall and work together 
with profit as well as did the third-grade class described 
here. 
5. Emphasize in your teaching the points used by 
the principal in commenting upon the recitations, child 
initiative, thoughtfulness and consideration for each other, 
intelligent questions on part of children, emphasis of 
worthwhile subject matter, and self-expression before 
an audience. 
6. Keep in mind the fact that this school emphasized 
drill of the proper kind and that results in the mechani- 
cal elements of school work were not lacking.

Bonssr, F. G.— The Elementary School Curriculum; The 
Macmillan Co. A superior sixth grade teacher stated 
that from reading this book she was helped to introduce 
successfully the project method into subjects which she 
had previously considered purely mechanical. 
Burton, W. H. — Supervision and the Improvement of Teach- 
ing; D. Appleton and Co. A book that only recently 
came to the writer’s desk. It appeared so wholesome 
and thorough that it was passed on to half a dozen su- 
perior teachers, all of whom reported that they regarded 
it as exceptionally valuable.

to refer to when it is necessary to find materials to en- 
rich the curriculum. 
Cusser.ey, E. P. — Public Education in the United States ; 
Houghton Mifflin Co. Mentioned by superintendents, 
principals, and teachers for providing knowledge and 
inspiration that made them desire to make of the Ameri- 
ean public school all that it ought to be. School officers 
of Detroit, a city noted especially for progressive edu- 
cation, report that they have made use of the ideas in 
this book as a basis for modifying school practice in 
Detroit. 
Earuanrt, L. B. — Types of Teaching; Houghton Mifflin Co. 
Is reported as being specially helpful in the solving of 
typical daily teaching problems.

The Macmillan Co. Teachers report this book espe- 
cially for its concrete treatment of The Problem Method, 
The Project, and Socialization. 
Gesett, A. H.— Normal Child and Primary Education; 
Ginn and Co. Many superior primary teachers report 
this book as being especially valuable in its interpre- 
tation of child nature. 
Hartman, G.— The Child and His School; Published by 
Bureau of Educational Experiments, 144 W. 13th St., 
New York City. A recent book that a number of su- 
perior teachers mention especially for its wealth of sug- 
gestive material and its bibliography. 
Hopes, C. F. — Nature Study and Life; Ginn and Co. This 
old book seems to be about as useful to teachers inter- 
ested in nature projects as it was when first published.

APPENDIX 285 
Hotes, W. H.— School Organization and the Individual 
Child; The Davis Press. This book did not have a 
very wide circulation, but a number of successful super- 
intendents as well as superior teachers reported that it 
gave them a complete statement of methods of meeting 
the needs of the individual. 
Jupp, C. H. — Introduction to the Scientific Study of Educa- 
tion; Ginn and Co. A number of progressive teachers 
and superintendents report that reading this book caused 
them to see that there is a real opportunity to develop 
a science of education. 
Kinpatrick, W. H.— “The Project Method;” Teachers 
College Bulletin; Columbia University, New York City. 
Reported by many as having established in their minds 
the fundamental reasons for project teaching.

Study; Houghton Mifflin Co. Mentioned many times 
as a well-organized, concrete account of processes that 
should be developed in teaching children how to study. 
McMorry, F. M. — Elementary School Standards; World 
Book Co. This book has been mentioned more times 
than any other on thelist. Teachers refer to it as having 
enlarged their ideas of the effects of teaching upon the 
activities of the child.

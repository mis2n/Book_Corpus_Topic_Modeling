REPORT OF COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BUREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. O., February 1, 1891. 
Str: I have the honor to submit herewith my first Annual Report, 
for the year ending June 30, 1889. 
T entered on duty as Commissioner of Education September 12, 1889. 
The statistics herewith presented for the year 1888-89 have come in 
since that date. This Office has to wait not only for the close of the 
scholastic year before it can begin its Report, but it must await a farther 
period until the State and local school officers scattered over the land 
have compiled and digested their statistics. Hence it happens that 
although returns for a given year begin to be received at the Bureau 
within two months after its close, they are not all in hand until the 
following spring. . 
In my opinion the first part of the Report should contain such a gen- 
eral summary as may be made from the returns that have been received 
before December 1 of each year, and should be published as early as the 
1st of January following. Then two or three months later should come 
an appendix containing the full tables revised by the addition of the re- 
turns that have been delayed. 
_ In this Report I present at first a general survey of the educational 
field, together with comparative tables showing theetrend of progress 
for a period of years. Next follow various exhibits showing the position 
which the United States occupies in comparison with Germany and 
France in respect to the provision actually made for elementary and 
higher education. After this there are offered several condensed state- 
ments in which the specialists of the Bureau have attempted to give the 
outlines of national systems of education. ‘These are offered as first 
drafts which it is expected to perfect by further studies and finally re- 
duce to brief statements showing the essential details characteristic of 
each system.    
GENERAL STATISTICS. 
The total number of pupils enrolled in the schools of all grades, public 
and private, in all the States, for the year ending June 30, 1889, is 
13,726,574. In this number is not included the attendance on evening 
schools or schools for art, manual and industrial training, trades, busi- 
ness, or schools for the defective, dependent, and delinquent classes or 
: XV!

  XVI REPORT, OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
schools for Indians. ‘These included (in the aggregate 288,280 pupils) 
would swell the total to over 14,000,000 persons who were receiving 
education in school for a longer or shorter period during the year. The 
average number of days during which the common schools were in ses- 
sion was 1343, and the average number of days during which the pupils 
of these schools actually attended was 874. This, at the rate of 5 school 
days per week, would give 174 weeks for the actual attendance, aver- 
aged by the entire enrollment. 
The question arises here as to the number of years of sibardance at 
“school for each pupil on an average. The number of persons in the 
United States between the ages of 6 and 20 years, inclusive, is 34 per 
cent. of the whole population. This would give, for the year 1889 
20,700,000 children of school age, of whom, as we have seen, nearly 
14,000,000 attended school, or 67 per cent. of all persons of suitable age. 
If it is reasonable to expect a school attendance of only that portion of 
the community whose ages range from 6 to 16, inclusive, then (since this 
portion is 26 per centum of the total population) we: may say that the: 
school enrollment was very nearly all to be expected, namely, 90 per 
cent. of the youth from 6 to 16 years, inclusive. 
From these data we may infer that on an average the youth of the 
land receive each 17 weeks of schooling annually for 10 years. 
Taken in this general aspect, the results do not seem otherwise than 
_ encouraging. Certainly the educative effect of 17 weeks’ schooling 
compared with 40 weeks (the annual term in cities) is much greater 
than the fraction seventeen-fortieths would indicate. Perhaps in 
20 weeks ‘the average school will teach three-fourths as much as it 
would in 40 weeks. The youth who attends school 3 months a year 
learns in 10 years much more than he would learn in 30 months of con- 
secutive schooling. x 
But these general averages conceal the bad side of school statistics 
by mixing it with the good. The length of the school term (see page 
18) is much longer in the Northern States than in the Southern, being 
‘something over 150 days in the former and less than 100 days in the 
“latter. The average attendance in both sections is about 65 per cent. 
of the number enrolled, and this reduces the actual amount of school- 
ing received by the total number to about 100 days in the North and 
60 days in the South. The sparsely settled country districts usually 
have short annual school terms, and this is the chief reason why the 
South makes so poor a showing in this respect. On the other hand, 
‘the South indicates a great and increasing interest in public-school 
education by the very large per cent. of its population which it enrolls 
' in school. It will be seen (page 1) that the public schools of the South 
make quite as good a showing as those of the North in this last respect. 
In this particular, however, the returns obtained from the several 
~ States are far from satisfactory. It isthe practice over a large portion 
of the country for the rural districts to have two terms separated by a 
long vacation, the one called a winter school and the other a summer

school, The winter term enrolls older pupils and is usually taught by Py 
a master, while the summer term is often taught by a different teacher. ° 
In the summer term more young pupils are enrolled, but there are 
many who attend both summer and winter terms, and these are counted _ 
twice in the State summaries of school enrollment in those States 
where efficient devices have not yet been invented to exclude from the 
returns all duplication. It is my impression that it is the more careful 
exclusion of duplicates that causes most of the apparent shrinkage in 
the per centum of enrollment in the public schools of the northern 
sections. In the North Atlantic division it will be seen (page 13) that — 
the enroliment has diminished from 22 per cent. in 1870 to less than 18 
per cent. in 1889. In the South Atlantic division, on the contrary, the 
per cent. has increased during the same: period from 6 to 20. The 
specialist of the Bureau who prepared the general statistical exhibit* 
has mentioned four other points to be considered (pages 15,16) in 
explaining this real or apparent decline in the school enrollment of the 
Northern States. I would urge, however, that whether the decline be 
real or only apparent, the enrollment is still as large as is normal. 
‘The increase in the length of school term, pointed out in the compara- 
tive tables, makes it possible for the youth to complete the course of» 
study in fewer years than formerly. Hence, although his aggregate 
schooling as measured by number of weeks has greatly increased, the 
number of years of enrollment may have decreased somewhat. It is the 
inerease of city population and the extension of urban systems of edu- 
cation into the villages along the line of the railroad that cause this 
increase in the length of the school term. 
GRADE OF INSTRUCTION. 
Looking at the grade of education we see (page 3) that less than 6 
pupils in the hundred are réturned as pursuing secondary and higher 
education, the remaining 94 being engaged upon the elementary course 
in reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, grammar, and United 
States history. The ratio of pupils in secondary schools (4. ¢., high 
schools, academies, and schools preparatory for college) to those in col- 
leges and universities is 5 to1. One in five hundred of the popula- 
tion is enrolled in schools for higher instruction. 
If we divide the school population, which has been stated to form 34 
per cent. of the total population, roughly into 3 classes, allowing for 
primary or elementary schools all between the ages of 6 and 13, inclu- 
sive, we shall set apart 20 per centum of the whole; the population 
aged from 14 to 17, inclusive, amounts to 8 per centum for secondary 
education; 6 per centum remains for the number aged 18 to 20, inclu-' 
sive, for higher education. These percentages applied to the results a 
shown by the statistics for the year 1889 give us the following ratios: 
For the 12,000,000 of school age for elementary instruction there were 
  
\ *Mr. F. E. Upton. ‘ ' ED 89-11 : én

       XVIIL REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER ‘OF EDUCATION. 
actually enrolled in public and private schools 12, 931,259, or an excess ~ 
- of nearly 1,000,000. For the 4,750,000 of school age fon secondary in- 
struction there were actually enrolled only 668,461, or less than one- 
seventh of the youth of age for that grade of work. Of the 4,000,000 
of right age for higher education there were enrolled only 126,354, or 
less than one-thirtieth of the quota. 
These data are explained by the fact that the apis enrolled as 
studying in the elementary grades of school work include some who 
have not yet completed their sixth year, and many more who are of 
ages ranging from 14 to 20 years. 
Six-sevenths of the population on arriving at the proper age for 
secondary education never receive it. Thirty out of thirty-one fail 
to receive higher education upon arriving at the proper age. 
SCHOOL PROPERTY. 
In 19 years the value of property owned for public schools has in- 
creased from $130,000,000 to $323,000,000, or more than twice as fast as — 
the population. During the same period the annual expenditures have’ . 
risen from $63,000,000 to $132,000,000, and the amount for each man, 
woman, and child has increased from $1.64 to $2.16. The Southern sec- 
tion has more than doubled its amount per capita. The annual cost of 
education in the public schools is $16.51 for each pupil in attendance,

The following exhibit shows ata glance the steady progress of the 
Southern States in the development of common-school education. 
There are no statistics accessible that show separate items for the white 
and colored schools previous to 1876. Since that period the enrollment 
_ of white pupils has increased 75 per cent., while the white population 
has increased little morethan 30. The colored enrollment has increased 
113 per cent., while the colored population has increased less than 25 
per cent. The amount of money expended from public funds has in- 
creased from $11,000,000 to $23,000,000 per annum.

COMPARISON OF SCHOOLS. Sea 
‘COMPARISON OF GERMAN, FRENCH, AND AMERICAN SCHOOLS, 
The legitimate function of the Bureau of Education is the collection 
and distribution of educational information.. Each place should know 
the fruits of experience in all other places. A national bureau should 
not merely collect the statistics of education in the several States, but 
should also study the systents sestablished by the various nations of 
Europe and Asia. Doubtless each nation has devised some kind of 
discipline, some course of study which will train the children of its 
schools into habits in harmony with its laws. An investigation of these 
features in view of the obvious demands of the governmental forms will 
furnish us with a science of comparative pedagogy. 
My predecessors in this Bureau have therefore presented from year 
to year in their Annual Reports a digest of foreign educational informa- 
tion, and have supplemented these by special studies of noteworthy 
educational changes abroad. 
The knowledge of other educational systems than our own is the most 
important of all species of practical knowledge, because it is a knowledge 
of methods, and this sort of knowledge alone it is that gives directive 
power. The explanation to ourselves of the differences that exist in our 
neighbor’s system and a careful study of the special fruits which grow 
from it will enlighten us as to our own peculiarities, and we shall watch 
these with care lest they become exaggerated and have results not to be 
desired. 
In the second chapter of this Report there is offered a comparison of 
the school systems of Germany and France with our own. The 
specialist* who has prepared it has accompanied his figures with 
graphic illustrations so as to impress on the reader the quantitative 
values of the items of school attendance and course of study. 
It will be noticed that the enrollment of all the pupils who have 
attended school for any portion of the year is not so large in the other 
countries as that returned for the United States. The proportion of 
pupils pursuing higher studies seems, however, to be much larger in 
Germany and France. It must be borne in mind that these comparative 
statistics are only approximately correct. There are many obstacles in 
the way besides inaccurate local records. The technical terms used by 
one nation do not have precisely the same import as words used by an- 
other nation to translate those terms. We are not yet sure that the item 
which we call “enrollment” corresponds precisely to what the French 
and Germans express by the words inscrit and eingeschrieben. It seems, 
too, that they do not find the item of average attendance by averaging 
the daily count. They take the attendance on two selected days of the 
: year and make the average of these two days stand for the average at- 
tendance for the year. That this method can furnish only approximate 
results is evident. Both days selected might prave stormy or unusually

pleasant; they would scarcely be average days. I note in the reports of 
the schools of St, Louis (Missouri) for the year 1879 the average attend- 
ance, calculated by averaging the daily reports for the entire year, was 
35,860 pupils, while averaging the reports for the days closing the first’ 
and last quarter of the year gives 35,925 pupils; but an average of 
the four days that closed the first, second, third, and fourth quarters 
gives 36,106. The year 1878 shows: 
Average for.entire year 2180, 410 
Average for closing days of first and fourth quarters..---.... 34,500 
Average for closing days of first} second, third, and fourth quarters... «+ 35,304 
This illustrates the unreliability of any method of calculating aver- 
age attendance except that of averaging daily reports for the whole 
year.   
      COURSE OF STUDY. 
The comparison of the courses of study shows that the French and 
Germans devote much less time than Americans to the study of orthog- 
raphy. The peculiarities of English spelling render necessary much 
memorizing. Were this exercise of memory devoted to the subject- 
matter of science and literature there would be acquired a store of 
useful erudition which future reflection might assimilate and turn into 
wisdom, But the spelling-book does not furnish food for reflection, or 
mental nourishment. Mechanical memorizing is the much-lamented 
characteristic of our common schools. It is evident that such must re- 
main their characteristic so long as English-speaking children mem- 
orize, like the Chinese, the arbitrary spelling of more than ten thou- 
sand words before they can write the language with readiness. But 
the Chinese gain one solid advantage. Their civilization, resting as 
it does on the patriarchal form, needs implicit obedience on the part 
of each and every person to those higher in rank and consideration by 
reason of age and official position. The Chinese child in memorizing 
the shape and structure of the complex sign that represents a word, 
trains himself at the same time into the habit of conforming to what is 
prescribed for him. By the time he has memorized the ten thousand 
complex symbols necessary to each scribe he has also memorized the 
classie writings which enjoin on his mind all the formalities necessary 
to testify his respect and obedience to his elders and superiors in rank. 
His mind is filled with adages, which impress on him the importance of, 
this obedience. Trained to mechanical habits of conformity and taught 
to believe in externally prescribed rules as of supreme authority, the 
Chinese youth is sure to be conservative. 
The singular feature of this kind of education is that the more the 
youth receives of it the more fixed he becomes in his conservatism. 
Western European education generally tends towards emancipation 
from authority. Only in so far as it deals with certain conventional 
elements which require mechanical memory does it have the opposite 
tendency of strengthening the habit of obedience to external authority. ’

COURSE OF STUDY IN FRANCE AND GERMANY. |. XXI 
Advocates of spelling reform (and these have become numerous and 
respectable since the Philological Society of Great Britain and of the 
English-speaking nations has declared a reformed spelling desirable) 
’ have perhaps not considered duly the influence of this protracted study 
of the irregularities of the English orthography in making the edu- 
cated classes of those nations more conservative than other Europeans. 
The Anglo-Saxon invented local self-government, not by a sudden 
brilliant thought, ‘a glittering generality born on the occasion of a 
declaration of independence, but rather by the slow growth of centuries 
of attempted oppression and centuries of stubborn resistance which 
ended in compromises, wherein both parties agreed to limit their will- 
fulness and adopt a common mete and bound to their desires. A vast 
net-work of formalities and usages (the ‘common law”) has grown up 
and is respected by all. At the same time it is full of inconsistencies, 
just because it represents the compromises between opposing wills, and 
is not in any sense a product of theoretical intelligence dealing with 
questions of abstract right. The superstitious respect of the Anglo- 
Saxon peoples for established usages leads them to accept without a 
murmur the patched-up system of spelling, which conceals more than 
it reveals the real etymologies of words. But in tura this spelling 
reacts én the race in such a way as to train all the people who succeed 
in climbing out of sheer illiteracy, into conservative habits of thought. 
When we consider what are the beneficial effects of this respect for 
established forms we may well hesitate to say that time expended 
in mechanical memory work has not been more productive of good 
than evil on the whole. Without a universally diffused respect for 
established usage, the English colonists would scarcely have proved as 
law-abiding as they have been. We can see in fact that the illiterate 
settlers on our border lands and in our Territories are always more prone — 
to lynch law and other deeds of violence than the educated settlers. 
However this may be, the problems of education are certainly complex, 
and it is not possible to settle the question of a course of study or even 
of a method of instruction without having constant reference to the 
effect which its reaction has upon the will and upon the formation 
of habits. We can see that the German-speaking nations lay great 
stress on’ the perfection of the central directive power. The ideal of 
their government is that of an omniscient intelligence, all powerful 
within the limits of the State and securing the welfare of the indi- 
vidual citizen, without giving him any very wide scope for personal ad- 
ventures or risks. It looks probable that this is the reason why the 
German givesso much scope to the inner freedom of his youth at school— 
as though it were to compensate for the external determinism ov the 
partof the State which surrounds the citizen with walls of fate; walls, 
indeed, of fate, but of a rational fate, the bonds,of reasonable action. 
Goethe makes Egmont say: “An honest citizen who maintains himself 
by his industry has always as much freedom as he can make use of.” ‘.

H 
Xxir REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
This freedom is sufficient for the citizea who travels the beaten track, 
but not for the one who desires to carve out a new career. The Ger- 
man Government does not encourage adventure and its consequent 
. risks—it is too wasteful. There are 95 failures to each 100 adventures 
in a career not prepared for by a lifelong education. 
The Anglo-Saxon, on the other hand, has for long centuries en- 
couraged individual enterprise and rewarded its success by monopolies 
and privileges. The English common people have since the earliest 
ages been eager for personal liberty and most jealous of encroachments 
on the part of centralized power. Their respect for established usage 
seems to contradict this tendency to individualism, but it is really its 
fulcrum and basis. Without this stress of attention to the limits which 
are set to the invasion of outside authority the private individual 
would not have so much impulse to exercise his freedom within those 
limits. The Chinese principle of family subordination does not leave 
untouched a sphere of wild freedom within the individual and hence 
does not incite the kind of reaction which produces personal adventure, 
original invention, and free thought. 
When we consider it therefore, we see that there is an equivalent 
trom the course of study to be sought on the will side of the character. 
‘This must be estimated as carefully as the intellectual equivalent. | 
There is another large field in which the mechanical memory gets | 
much training, and that is the study of the grammars and of the classic 
languages. The mastery of rules and lists of exceptions—of long and 
numerous paradigms—of whimsical idioms of speech—is a poor train- 
ing of the intellect so far as powers of thought are concerned, but it 
. is a training of the will specially adapted to form habits of circum- 
spection and considerate regard for the rights and privileges of one’s 
fellow men, and of an equal persistence in respect to one’s own legiti- 
mate prerogatives. We note here the fact that Latin and Greek are 
the original tongues of the two ancient nationalities that discovered 
the two essential factors of our civilization—the Greeks exploring the 
intellect and the artistic faculties, while the Roman made an inventory, 
on the side of the will, of the forms which deeds must have in order 
not to conflict with the social whole. The Roman, in short,'has given 
to mankind the formule of the free will. 
The individual will attackthg the will of the social whole contradicts 
itself, for the substantial will is the will of the social whole. This is 
the distinction of freedom from license, and its expression is due to the 
Roman spirit. The great significance of the Greeks and Romans in 
furnishing the two pillars for modern civilization sufficiently justifies 
the prominence of Latin and Greek in the course of study for youth. 
But, in order to weigh carefully their educative effect, we must have - 
special regard to the methods by which they are taught—whether by 
memorizing and applying grammatical rules or by oral usage without 
grammar. It is not possible to tell, therefore, by a mere inspection of
-P-A-G-E-23
1 
‘the course of study whether the German and French youth are, on an 
" ayerage, two or three years in advance of the American youth. One 
must inquire into the methods of study. Ifthe French youth comes to 
Latin at the age of 10 years, while the American youth begins it at,the 
age of 13, it is quite likely that the American youth employs a different 
method—perhaps the grammatical method rather than the method 
which lays stress on a practical use of the language in speaking and 
_ writing. The grammatical method is for the most part a training in 
_ logical discrimination. It does not go for much in the way of mastery 
of a language for use, but it is, perforce, a fine discipline for the devel: 
opment of intellectual acuteness and directive power. 
It is to be hoped that a more discriminating comparison may be made 
in regard to the methods of education abroad, so that we may know the 
entire scope of the problem. We must count in without omission all 
the educative values before we weigh the products of our own schools 
against those of other nations. But the seeming backwardness of our 
pupils should give us concern and impel us to this investigation with- 
out delay. i 
THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS OF EUROPE. 
It is the province of the Bureau of Education to present the ‘statistics 
of education in such a manner as to assist the American people to, 
avail themselves of the experiments in progress at home and abroad. 
The first step in this work is to separate what is peculiar and inei- 
dental to local needs from what is of universal application and useful 
to all educational systems. What is not to be imitated must be dis- 
criminated and explained as carefully as its valuable counterpart. 
For this purpose each system should be studied in its historical proe- 
ess of growth and development. How it came to be and what end it 
has subserved and why it has been modified are questions that must 
be answered in order to understand its present status and comprehend 
the tendencies that are gathering in force to effect further changes. 
The American student notices with interest that the general political 
trend in Europe since the discovery and colonization of the New World 
is in favor of individual freedom. The development of natural science 
and the application of it to useful inventions continually increase the 
rate of production of wealth and the factlities of rapid transit of person 
and property as well as the means of intercommunication. The age 
is consequently synthetic in its tendencies, uniting each nation to all 
others, and educating it by the constant spectacle of the doings of all 
and to a less degree by actual commercial and diplomatic intercourse. 
Such synthesis of home ideas with foreign ideas is a constant education 
directed against the exclusiveness of caste within the nation. All peo- 
ple see the spectacle of the rapid conquest of nature, the sudden rise of 
individuals from obscurity into enduring fame, and the perspective of 
human history which foreshortens the millenniums of man’s achieve- EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS OF EUROPE. XXII

  XXIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
ment in such a manner that it seems a constant and rapid develop- 
ment. The lower and lowest strata of society in our civilization are 
not only stimulated by seeing the material progress of their day, but 
they are visited by manifold influences from the higher strata of society 
and specially incited to discontent with their lot. They are offered the 
right of the ballot, they are compelled to educate their children in 
free schools, they are proselyted for political and social causes. 
These processes are going on in all Christian civilization with more 
or less rapidity, from our own Pacific coast eastward across the Atlantic 
to the extreme Russian borderland. Every score of years marks some 
noteworthy step toward popular freedom. It is this progress which 
lays emphasis on the development of educational systems. Yor school 
education is vitally related to this deeper movement that agitates all 
our civilization. School education becomes first a necessity for the 
sake of the military and industrial success of the nation. Then next the 
educated intelligence of the individuals demands recognition for itself 
_ through the abolition of easte and through representation in the gov- 
ernment. ; 
The past tweaty years of educational history in Europe are. more in- 
teresting and instructive in this respect than all other epochs. 
The specialists of this Bureau have begun an extensive study ofthe 
data on hand with a view to a new and clearer presentation of the es- 
sential outlines of the educational systems of Europe. A few of these 
presentations are offered in this Report, namely, those for England, 
France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Spain, 
and Brazil. Others wiil follow hereafter until all are given. But 
meanwhile it is confessed that these first attempts at concise state- 
ments of national education will be found very imperfect. It is 
expected (and desired) that criticism at home and abroad will be free 
and minute. It is certain that the division of labor and the consequent 
concentration of attention on comparatively narrow fields of study will 
by and by educate these specialists into experts. If this Bureau were 
to hold back the publication of these statements until they had become 
approximately perfect, for fear of the sharp criticism anticipated, it 
would postpone for selfish reasons the exercise of a healthful influence 
in stimulating this comparative study of foreign educational experi- 
ments. What is found to be crude and hasty in the statements here 
published will, no doubt, have the effect of inciting the study and in- 
vestigation of original sources of information, and this Bureau will get 
aid from a corps of auxiliary students scattered over the world. 
It is hoped that the statement of what is essential to present the liv- 
ing forces and structure of a national educational system may be very 
much abridged at each successive revision. ‘The events of the year in 
the field of education, when presented in this Report, should always be 
accompanied with such a general survey of the national system to which 
they belong as to make clear to the reader what significance they have.

     EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF ENGLAND. 
- Bach nation reacts in its own way and manner against the necessity - 
which is forcing governments to establish systems of popular education 
as a means of national defense. Each stamps upon its system its own 
ethnical character and, consciously or unconsciously, perpetuates its 
own institutions by its schools. 
THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF ENGLAND. 
The specialist* who has prepared this statement of the school system 
of England mentions among its characteristics, first, its combination 
of public and private agencies in the control and maintenance of 
schools (page 106), This is a significant hint of the principle which 
must be kept in view before all in explaining English institutions. 
here does not seem to be anything universal except compromise— 
everything is limited by something opposing it; English institutions 
express in their very form their origin in mutual struggle that has 
“ended in mutual recognition and tolerance. The Huglish statesman 
ean hardly conceive of a theoretically perfect system imposed on the 
nation by Parliament. The new system must not only be founded on 
the old but it must admit the old to its fullest validity as a determin- 
ing element. This appears in a variety of forms. There are mentioned 
three kinds of parishes only partially coincident—the boundaries being 
different. The 52 counties of England and Wales are divided into 14,946 
parishes for poor-law purposes, these being organized into 649 unions; 
into 13,000 parishes for ecclesiastical purposes, and again into 14,777 | 
parishes for highway supervision. In the same territory there are 163 
municipal boards established forthe management of schools, and 2,111 
boards which comprise single parishes or parish unions. Nearly all of 
the superior education is voluntary, two-thirds of it given by the 
ancient foundations at Oxford and Cambridge. There are royal mili- 
tary and naval schools exclusively governmental, and the Government 
also aids schools of science and art. The secondary schools are like- — 
wise voluntary, including the nine famous endowed “ public schools” 
(Eaton, Rugby, Harrow, ete.), and nearly a’ thousand others. There 
are also ‘‘ proprietary ” and “ private” schools and ‘ladies’ colleges.” _ 
In this branch of the subject (secondary education) nothing like a 
complete survey is possible. The information is lacking. This Bureau 
of Education collects and publishes each year a list of private second- 
ary schools for the United States. Such a list is needed for England 
in order to furnish data for the study of this very important part of its ° 
education system. Turning tothe elementary schools, we find the first 
traces of governmental interest in education. But the schools estab- 
lished entirely by the Government—what we call in America “ public 
schools” or “common sehools”—furnish less than 40 per centum of the _ 
entire amount of elementary instruction, while “ voluntary schools” 
  
*Miss Annie Tolman Smith,

      “XXVI_.-_ REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
furnish more than 60 per centum. These voluntary elementary schools 
receive aid from the General Government to the amount of nearly one- 
half of their entire support, and in return for this’ aid must submit to: 
certain conditions of indirect supervision and regulation of the course 
of study. The Established Church of England alone provides nearly 
one-half of the elementary instruction thus aided by the Government, 
and the other denominations, together with the secular private schools, 
furnish less than one-sixth. 
All the schools collect tuition fees (called “school pence”) amounting 
on an average to 26 per centum of the total school support, the fees at 
the board schools being about two thirds the rates collected at the vol- 
untary schools. There is local taxation to support the board schools, 
providing nearly 40 per centum of the revenues, the General Government 
providing a’slightly larger sum than the boards. The method of dis- 
tributing the grant of the General Government causes the voluntary 
schools to get a larger per centum (nearly one-sixth larger) than the 
board schools; for the money is so distributed as to directly stimulate 
the efforts of the teachers and school managers by paying for results, 
chiefly in the line of scholarship. It would be supposed quite natu- 
rally that the private schools would draw more largely on the well-to-do 
classes who possess more directive power in the community. The 
children of these classes would inherit intellect and will power above the 
standard of mediocrity, and would show this in their annual examina- 
_ tions for passing the so-called ‘‘ standards.” The board schools aided 
by the compulsory law would get a larger portion of the children of 
the lower strata, less precocious in intellect and will power and in many _ 
cases not inheriting from parents any predisposition towards literary 
or mathematical studies. What allowance must be made for profes- 
sional skill on the part of the teacher is not easy to determine, but 
- probabilities are in favor of the teachers of the board schools for the 
reason that they have a larger proportion of persons professionally 
trained than the voluntary corps. Nearly 70 per cent. of the masters 
‘and 45 per cent. of the mistresses in 1889 had received such profes- 
sional training. 
In the distribution of the government grant the per capita of average 
attendance is first considered, and a grant of 7 to 9 shillings made for 
each pupil in the infant schools, and a larger sum (13 shillings 6 pence) 
for the pupils of advanced grades. Then come special grants designed 
to Stimulate special studies or special features of excellence in discipline 
and organization. These subjects include needlework for the girls— 
excellence being rewarded at the rate of a shilling per pupil; drawing 
for the boys (1 shilling); singing (6 pence to 1 shilling); cookery for 
girls (4 shillings); laundry work for girls (2 shillings); other higher 
special branches (4 shillings). A special allowance is made for excel- 
lence in discipline and organization of 1 shilling to 1 shilling 6 pence 
per pupil. Grants also are made for pupil teachers (£1 to £5) and as-

sistants (£10 to £15) who pass successful examinations for certificates — 
or other professional degrees of progress. Numerous auxiliary institu. 
tions in the form of sociéties founded for the promotion of one or 
another good feature in educational work serve to stimulate the teacher 
or pupil and reénforce the government supervision. 
Outside of the elementary education, aided by the General Govern: 
ment and enforced by its compulsory lave the universities have estab- 
lished a system of lectures and home study in a vast number of local 
centers in England, under the general name of “ University Extension.” _ 
Perhaps there was a sense of danger from the growth of board schools— 
a feeling that a vast stratum of people educated in a system of schools — : 
in nowise related to the university education of the country, would be 
in natural antagonism to the stratum of gentry and nobility educated 
in the universities. There was good ground forsuch a fear. A sort of 
Philistinism is sure to arise in a system of schools which does not in- 
elude within it all grades of higher instruction as well as elementary in- 
struction. This appears first in an attack on the conventional course 
of study chosen for culture and a “ liberal” education. The so-called 
“practical” studies are much bepraised at the expense of “orna- 
mental” studies. Under the former are included studies whose relation — 
to the arts and trades are most obvious; under the latter those branches 
which minister to general culture. The studies which give one insight 
into human nature and into the historical growth of the institutions 
which prevail are really the most practical of all studies, and yet these 
studies are the first ones attacked by the “Philistines” as ornamental 
rather than useful. 
The University Extension movement in 1889 reached numerous local 
centers in England and Wales and included 380 courses of lectures, with _ 
‘40,187 persons in its audiences. It is difficult to say who have derived 
most benefit from this movement. The University graduates have been 
led by it to study the questions that arise in the minds of the masses of 
the people, and by this study ate obtaining an ability to make valid to all 
classes of people the results of higher studies in science and literature, 
They make secure thereby the foundations of higher learning in the 
minds of the masses and reéstablish its authority on an entirely new 
basis—a basis of recognition and affectionate respect rather than the 
former one of caste and haughty assumptjon of superiority. The work 
of university extension furnishes the desired field for that large and in- 
creasing class of scholars known as post-graduates or « fellows, ? who 
need to apply their knowledge, and to conduct original investigations in 
the form of seminary and laboratory work in connection with researches 
into existing institutions. They are to come into contact with the 
people on the one hand, while they on the other hand are themselves 
still under the control of the university. The highest class of educated 
minds is brought to the assistance of the lowest. A sort of inventory - 
of the enterprising and aspiring individuals among the uneducated

classes will be secured, and they will be brought under the influence of 
university traditions and modes of reasoning. This will give a solidity 
of opinion on all practical subjects in the highest degree salutary. It 
will correct alike the narrowness of the specialist and the shallowness 
of the self-educated. This feature of English education is well caleu- 
lated to prove serviceable in all English- speaking countries, and is 
_ indeed in process of migration to America now. 
_ In this brief mention of the salient points of English education we 
“see at once why the reader who looks for system is apt to find himself 
completely bewildered, The complexity is so great and the limitations 
of the government initiative are so numerous that what belongs to the 
general government in British education seems to be only the exception, 
while what belongs to private initiative seems to be the rule. 
_ This bewilderment happens because our educated people are apt to 
form in their minds an ideal of government quite in accord with the 
continental ideal, but not in accord with the conviction and practice of 
the English-speaking peoples. Our theory is not in accord with our 
practice; but our practice is in advance of our theory. The oid 
Roman ideal of government prevails with comparatively slight modi- 
fication on the continent, while that ideal has been set aside by the 
_ Anglo-Saxon people for a higher ideal, which is roughly described as 
~ “joeal selfgovernment.” The former or Romanideal secures the rights 
of private property and the ownership of land but insists on the utter 
and complete subordination of the individual before the law. The 
private right is as nothing before the right of the public. But with the 
~ Anglo-Saxon, the private individual and the locality—every special in- 
terest, in fact—are recognized as having an inexpugnable claim to recog- 
nition on the part of the general government. This recognition does 
not stop at equality before the law as on the continent, but insists on a 
_ share of the power of the government—it must be recognized as wield- 
ing a part of the determining power of the government. The govern- 
ment systematically admits all parties and interests to codperate with 
- it in fixing the rule of the land. Hence comes the most tender con- 
sideration of private interests and privileges vested in individuals and 
elasses. What has come to be, what has made itself a place, isassumed 
to have rights that the government is bound to respect. By a sort of 
fiction all that has been done by the individual is assumed to be estab- — 
lished by the government ant to have rights over any proposed inno- 
vation, no matter how reasonable that innovation may be. 
To state it summarily, one would say that the continental ideal tends 
to look upon the government as a detached raling power, complete in 
itself and responsibl e only to itself for dictating reasonable laws and 
ordinances to the people who form a class below. Even in continental 
“+ republics there is this assumption of the Roman ideal. But in Great 
Britain and her derived peoples the government is one factor and the 
individuals and organized interests form another factor in a state of
-P-A-G-E-29
  
Ke Gi y eke x \

tension, the one against the other in such a manner that the actual net — 
result of the struggle settles the concrete law in force. 
' This representation of all individuals and all organized interests as 
‘concrete factors in the administration of the government furnishes a 
species of education unique in the history of the world for its power to 
_ stimulate and develop individual directive power. The constant pull of ; 
the government on the individual is a sort of training in personality. 
It stimulates to self-government—to care of one’s own affairs on an in- 
dependent footing. It stimulates to adventure and to large combina- 
tions, and to jealousy of governmental combination as though this were 
the prerogative of the individual. In some of its features it seems to be 
very defective in that it affords no protection to the individual who does 
not stand up for his rights; and in that it refuses to represent interests 
that do not claim representation and secure it by actual show of power. 
That this species of training, whatever its defects may ke, does actu- 
ally succeed in producing a greater development of individual directive 
power will be claimed and admitted by those who favor local self-gov- 
ernment. It is necessary to keep this point in view in studying the 
school system of England. That which has asserted itself and come 
to be has rights and must be respected to the full extent to which the - 
remaining portion of the nation can find it possible to permit. Hach 
individual and each interest has some sphere wherein it is inexpugna- 
ble, wherein its force is equal to the aggregate force of the nation. If 
it claims sway over a larger sphere than this minimum it must try its’ 
force against the nation, and it will succeed if it can draw toits side a 
sufficient portion of that opposing whole. Thus this struggle is a 
training in rationality because it causes each local interest to make its 
claim as rational as possible and to appear to be the interest of as many 
as possible of the people. 
If one defines the great heirloom received from the Roman Empire as 
the ideal of a perfectly rational government, one that establishes jus- 
tice, we can define the Anglo-Saxon contribution as the ideal of a goy- 
ernment which devotes itself supremely to the nurture and culture of 
individual directive power by admitting it to a share in determining the 
law. ‘To the continental political philosophers the English constitution 
seems to be whimsical. The exceptions and special privileges seem 
absurd and, unaccountable to them. But the constitution was not a 
theoretic product, It arose through ages of struggle, in which were 
measured the relative degrees of strength and stubbornness of the 
quotas of people that are fused into the common stock—the Celt, the 
Roman, the Saxon, the Dane, and the Norman. Wherever the strug- 
gle stopped because neither side could gain any more or be found to 
yield any more, there a compromise fixed the law of procedure written 
or unwritten. The British constitution is tull of legal fictions and un- 
_ written but inviolable conventions of procedure sacred to the Anglo- 
Saxon as representing the concrete balance of interests which has been

reached at the cost of the Atbab precious blood that ine island has pro- 
duced. While the continental ideal is the realization of justice for all, 
the British ideal is that of the participation of all parties and interests 
in the definition and administration of justice, each party in accordance 
with the actual proportion which it represents of the aggregate power 
-of the State. 
Party politics has this deep significance in English-speaking nations: 
In the Parliament this party struggle compromises in the shape of laws 
and statutes which express as nearly as possible the relative strength 
of the pressures of the opposing parties. But after a law has been 
passed it is still on trial, for where local self-government prevails the 
law must find a public opinion which will sustain it or else it will be a 
dead letter. For not only the legislative power in England is a con- 
crete synthesis of all powers and interests, but also the executive and 
judicial powers are a synthesis or combination or unity, each in its own’ 
kind, of the forces of individuals and local interests with the general 
interest. Theoretical or ideal perfection goes for nothing except so far 
as it can work conviction in the minds of the majority. Even after the 
law is passed it can not be executed unless public opinion sanctions it. 
Measured from the old ideal—the Roman ideal that prevails gener- 
ally on the continent, and quite generally among educated people in 
Great Britain and America—the British method seems to haye glaring 
defects at every turn. For instance, it is well known that all that has 
become established, no matter how imperfect or positively injurious, is 
a concrete power to hinder the adoption of a new and better system. 
But, per contra, as soon as the new system is well understood to be 
_ better than the old, the necessary majority can be secured for its adop- 
tion, Self-government alone is freedom. To have good laws made for 
one without one’s voluntary aid is not felt to be a good thing by the 
Anglo-Saxon. It is better to have bad laws and smart for it until one 
is educated up to the perception of the remedy for the evil. 
This-discussion may seem doctrinaire and out of place here, but I have 
been so much impressed with the injustice of strictures made on the 
English educational system (or lack of system if such a designation is 
preferred) that it has seemed worth while to call attention to the true 
point of view from which -we may see the motives underlying the 
national action. Without such insight into the objects and purposes 
_of the national action we have no true basis for any criticism, favorable 
or unfavorable. What is a nation undertaking to do for and with its 
people? When we have answered this question we may understand 
its educational system and see its trend prophetically. 
It is evident that Great Britain is on the way towards a national 
public opinion which will make its schools free.* The action of the

iehdiig nations on the continent has the effect of forcing the matter on 
the attention of the people, and the constantly increasing favor which 
the cause of education gets as a natural consequence of general educa- 
_tion of the people in the schools for the past twenty years—the irk- 
someness of the tuition fee, coupled as it is with a compulsory law—will 
have the effect of moving public opinion round to the point of the 
adoption of a free educational system. The private school interest will 
favor it because it is also its 6wn interest to have an increase of the 
government grant. But the unendowed schools will gradually fall off, - 
leaving the field after years to the endowed schools and the board 
schools. This at least appears the probable future trend of the English 
system, judging by the past and by the English mode of action. 
The thoughtful observer has constant occasion to admire the pru- 
dence with which the English nation moves forward in such a manner - 
as to get the full benefit out of all that has been already achieved. ‘It 
wastes nothing that it finds. But perhaps it deserves criticism for a 
too great economy—an economy that wastes the raw material of pres- 
ent possibilities of youth under better methods and appliances in order 
to utilize capital invested in somewhat antiquated appliances, This is 
not certain, however, and judging the case by the national principle of 
government above discussed, one is apt to conclude that the method 
adopted is the best as well as the only one practicable.

France * in many respects stands in sharp contrast to England. Al- 
though France is a republic it has far more centralization than is per- 
mitted in English- speakin g countries, even 1 when under a monarchical 
form of government. 
France has preserved the traditions of the classic nations, Greece 
and Rome, more nearly than any other modern State. Artists flock to 
Paris from all parts of the world to get the best instruction in painting 
and sculpture. The fashions of the civilized world are dictated from 
the French capital. What is to be regarded as good taste in clothing 
is the product of Frenchinvention. For hundreds of years France set- 
tled more serious concerns, namely: the forms of polite manners and 
the ideals of civilized behavior and Roser ean diplomacy.

XEED ; REPORT OF THE ; COMMISSIONER oF EDUCATION. 
          The fine arts applied to industry have always been a prolific source 
- of wealth from the time when the jewelry and purple clothing of Babylon 
furnished the center of attraction for the ancient world. France has 
so long schooled her workmen in classic models that hereditary descent 
of aptitudes for tasteful ornament and beautiful finish is to be counted 
on among the people. Skilled labor, and what is more potent for the 
production of riches, labor that is guided by artistic taste, pours wealth 
into France. The size of the nation and its position give to it political 
power. It touches on its borders the nations of northern, southern, and 
central Europe. 
What are the problems of its education? It must secure this prepara- 
tion for its industries; it must educate a people who shall lead the 
fashions of civilization; and before all it must preserve its rank of lead- 
ing power among the nen of the continent of Europe. Close allied 
to fashion and esthetic ornament is the art of military displays and 
manceuvres. The French have held the same preéminence in this field 
as in the others for long centuries. In a work of art there is exhibited 
the complete subordination of the parts to the unity of the whole. So, 
too, in the maneuvreing of an army the same subordination is displayed. 
Tens of thousands of independent wills, each one with its own desires, 
aims, and purposes, are consolidated into one gigantic whole, moved by 
one will and animated by one purpose. The French love of centraliza- 
tion and military display is quite as much an esthetic one as a love of 
power and conquest. It differs from the old Roman love of arms and do- | 
minion in this respect: The Roman loved unity of will for its own sake 
and made it his national purpose to reduce all people to the sway of one 
goyernment, so that Roman law, the abstract form of civil freedom, 
should everywhere prevail and universal peace be the result. The 
' French national spirit loves the unity that is manifested in a vast com- 
‘plex of details, perfectly subordinating them and reflecting itselfin them. 
It loves the reflection of this unity in concrete masses rather than in 
- the abstract form, and this is esthetic rather than political or legal. It 
loves art more than equality before the law. French history shows 
that this hunger for manifestation has always accentuated this distine- 
tion from the old Roman, to whom, nevertheless, there still remains so 
great aresemblance. It is old Rome incorporated with Athens—love 
of power subordinated to a love of display. This is not to be under- 
stood as a love of vulgar display, but a noble love of art in its best 
forms—the love of the manifestation of the domination of human rea- 
son over brute matter. The best French aspiration loves to see reflected 
in all its surroundings the loftiest attributes of the soul—free rationality 
and its victory over chaos. and confusion. Even the French peasant 
will not show bad taste in decoration, as the more northern Teutonic 
peasantry will do. There is that sense of moderation and self-control 
‘which belonged to the ancient Greeks—a display. of rule and modera- 
tion which constitutes the essence of the beautiful.
-P-A-G-E-33
    pe : 
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF FRANCE. XXXII 
This union of thé Greek and Roman principles and the modification 
of the one through the other constitutes an advance over both on the 
whole. The fanatical intensity of the Roman love of the state is miti. 
gated by the Athenian love of the appearance of rationality and the - 
celebration of the human as divine. The vulgar luxury and sensuality 
of the Roman. is elevated and refined into splendor by art and taste. 
The sensual is converted into the «esthetic—the former a selfish delight 
of the body and the latter an unselfish delight of the soul. For art 
dignifies matter by giving to it the semblance of freedom and independ- 
ence—the work of art appears to exist for its own sake and not for the 
sake of usefulness. 
But this is the reason why the French have not excelled all other 
nations in the forms of modern art. Italy has excelled in painters of . 
the Romantic school, and Germany has excelled in music. England has 
excelled in poetry, producing more first-class poets alone than all the 
rest of modern Europe combined. The French have clung close to the 
classic ideals and have nurtured the classic spirit by their education. 
They have managed to arrest theirnational spirit atthat stage bymeans 
of their skillfully devised education. Great as French art is in the 
realms named—in painting, music, and poetry—there is always felt 
even inits farthest departures towards Romantic art the presence of the 
classic ideal as a restraining principle. This prevents the French artist : 
from abandoning entirely the conventional standards and moving for- 
ward toa new esthetic ideal, such as wefindina Raphael, a Shakespeare, 
and a Beethoven. But this, too, is the greatness of the French and | 
gives them their world-wide dominion as arbiters of fashion and the 
conventionalities of taste and refined luxury. f 
The French nation shows all these peculiarities in its schools. It has 
established within 20 years a wonderful school system, complete in all 
its parts and the admiration of all who go to inspect it. It exhibits a | 
nation at school, so to speak. All the centralization of the French ideal 
is there; the unity of the governing power displayed at the capital is 
reflected in subordinate centers (the 17 districts which are called aca- 
démies), and again in the minuter subdivisions (the 87 departments) 
and still again in the 36,121 minutest divisions called communes (corre- 
sponding in part to school districts and in part to townships in the United 
States). : é 
The Romans governed their conquered territories by prefects or su- 
perintendents (overseers) and secured therein the sway of Roman laws. ° 
The French have preserved as the chief executive officer of each de- 
partment the prefect (préfet) appointed by the central government. 
But'there is added a modern democratic device, a local legislative as- 
sembly for each department elected by the general suffrage. There is 
a subprefect for each of the 362 arrondissements or subdivisions of the 
departments, with a local council elected by the cantons (there are 2,865 
of these subdivisions of the arrondissements), and finally there is a mu-

- nicipal council for each of the minutest subdivisions, the communes, 
and a mayor ‘chosen by: the government (in the large towns) from this 
council which is elected by the people. The commune, it is true, varies 
in size from a dozen people to two millions (Paris), according to the 
necessity of municipal unity; there are more than 200 communes with a 
population of upwards of 10,000 people. Thus we see the unity of the 
central government everywhere joined to the democratic principle of 
loca] election. But the local legislative bodies must not take up ques- 
tions that relate to the general government, 7. e., political questions, 
The central government at Paris alone is charged with this matter. 
This is a consistent whole easily comprehended and easily supervised 
and controlled from the center. The school system is erected on it. 
~The seventeen “ académies,” or educational sections into which France 
is divided, form each an educational system complete in all its grades. 
There is an executive officer at the head of each académie, a sort of edu- 
cational prefect who is assisted by an academie council. This form of 
organization prevails from the most general governing body down to 
the minutest subdivision—always an executive assisted by a council. 
First there is the minister of education assisted by the superior council 
of public instruction. The coyncils represent the different orders of 
instruction and are elected by their co-workers for the most part. The 
rector of the académie and his council follow next in rank; then thé in- 
spectors with their assisting councils in the departments. Then inspec- 
tors of cantons and large communes similarly assisted. 
The higher education, including what we call universities, colleges, 
and professional schools in America, is organized into facultés or edu- 
cational corporations similar to our State universities, except that there 
is complete control on the part of the central government and very little 
of the local initiative that exists with us. Our use of the word faculty 
applies only to the teaching body—the president, professors, and tutors, 
who have charge of the instruction and discipline of the college or uni- 
% versity. But in France the word faculté is applied to the entire insti- 
tution and a student entering a college is said to be “inseribed in a 
faculté” The French use of this word retains its old meaning from the 
time of the early universities of Europe. The words faculté and acadé- 
mie must not be translated by the English words faculty and academy. 
The word academy usually signifies with us a private secondary school 
or high school that furnishes preparation for college, and more rarely 
it designates a learned society. But in France it is one of the seven- 
teen great subdivisions of the country for educational purposes. 
The secondary education of'France is carried on in lycées and com- 
‘munal colleges. Perhaps the lycée carries the pupil nearly a year’s 
work further than our average academy or high school. -The word 
lyceum with us is applied to a course of lectures open to the public at 
large. : 
The elementary schools of France include three grades of primary 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  
       
instruction. First, the infant schools for children from 2 to 6 yoars; 
secondly, the elementary primary for pupils from 6 to 13 years, and 
thirdly, a superior primary course designed to fit youths for business 
and especially to give them skill and taste as workmen. 
The compulsory age for attendance as fixed in 1882 is 6 to 13 years, 
and instruction in the primary schools has been gratuitous since 1881, 
The relative proportions of pupils in the different grades (in 1887-88) 
showed about 500,000 in the infant schools, over 5,500,000 in the pri- 
mary (only 40,000 of these being in the superior primary), nearly 170,- 
000 in the secondary schools, 9,000 in the normal schools, and 18,000 _ 
in the universities. About 3 per cent. are in the secondary and supe- 
rior grades; 8 per cent. in the infant schools, and 88 per cent. in the 
primary. One-half of the university students are in the institution at 
Paris. . , 
The pains taken in French schools to prepare the workmen for skilled 
labor and especially for the production of works showing tasteful fin- 
ish is one of the most noteworthy features. The superior primary 
schools lay especial emphasis on this. The industries of the locality 
are considered in each commune. Drawing and designing are every- 
where taught. There are schools of industrial apprenticeship either 
detached in separate institutions or as elective courses in the primary 
schools. There are the great technical schools, the most famous of the 
world, like the Hicole Polytechnique, and similar schools for mining, arts 
and trades, arts and manufactures, political science, forestry, naviga- 
tion, ete. 
The instruction in the arts is specializing in its character, and aims to 
fit the youth directly for a specific occupation—for some particular 
braneh of a trade, and not, like our manual training schools, to give the 
pupil a general insight into all kinds of arts in wood and the metals. 
The pupil may go direct from the school into the shop without further — 
apprenticeship. The French schools do not waste any of the time of 
the pupil on random experiments at invention or artistic design, but 
they guide the pupil into the conventional ways of construction and. 
into the settled canons of taste. Perhaps the French graduate will 
have less originality and fewer resources under new conditions, but he — 
will neyer produce anything of an ugly shape. He will gain the maxi- / 
mum of skill and dexterity in shaping the materials that belong to his 
province. 
The instruction in the French schools natn emulation and rivalry 
to a greater extent than is approved in Germany and America. Per- 
haps this is a survival of the methods made famous by the Jesuits in 
their schools. The national characteristic of artistic exposition, and of 
unity and perspicuity in treating details, leads to a multitude of devices 
to make the instruction in the primary grades appeal to the senses,

out this feature very prominently. No other nation can equal the 
_ French in making things speak for themselves. The formation of 
school museums has been stimulated until a large per cent. of the 
schools are well provided. 
The impulse of the French people that leads to centralization jel 
causes a pressure against parochial schools. In the past there has not 
been that separation of church and State which exists in the United 
States. We have seen that England has still 60 per cent. of its pupils - 
in parochial schools. France has something like 20 per cent. of its 
pupils in parochial schools. The struggle towards separation of church 
and State is more intense in France because the question is compara: 
tively new, as itis in all Catholic nations. In the United States the 
number of pupils in private schools, both secular and parochial, 
amounts to only 10 per cent. of the whole; in France to'20.8 per cent.; 
in England to 62 percent. With us the friends of public schools do 
not desire the abolition of all private and parochial schools. They 
furnish a safe-guard against the degeneracy of the public-school man- 
agement. When there are dangerous extremes adopted in the methods 
of discipline or instruction at once the pendulum swings towards pri- 
yate and parochial schools, until the better mind of the community is 
warned and a reaction sets in. There is always a tendency in State 
schools towards too much mechanism, and the private school furnishes 
*a nursery for individuality in methods of instruction besides providing 
a safety-valve, so to speak, for the discontent of that class of people 
who love the freedom to depart from the customs followed by the great 
majority. 
The present trend of French education is towards farther separation 
_ of the public from the parochial education, and also towards a sharper 
discrimination of modern branches of Sbadty from the traditional classic, 
course. The questions of the function of Latin and Greek and the 
- place of science in the school course as compared with literature and 
the humanity studies, and, above all, the secondary and higher education 
of women, receive great attention and sharp party lines are drawn. 
One may predict that classical studies will not be abolished, but will be 
seen for what they are worth in furnishing the youth with that neces- 
- sary acquaintance with the two strands of his civilization that were 
derived from Greece and Rome. But science will be fully recognized 
and adopted into the curriculum. : 
The education of girls in the elementary schools has already become 
quite as extensive as the education of boys. But in secondary schools 
the girls amount to only 6 per cent. of the entire number, and the num 
ber under superior instruction is quite insignificant. In America the 
girls in secondary schools outnumber the boys. The higher education 
of the women acts powerfully to reénforce the education of the children 
in the following generations. It will tend to increase the centrifugal : 
force of the French character. It will make it more independent of :

central authority, but atthe same time will mee the central authority 
more stable by forming in each family and in each individual an au- 
thority based on reason and in harmony with the central government. 
The newspaper age is an age (already arrived in America) in which a 
public opinion is formed by the universal contemplation of the sanie 
common public issues of the day and a general discussion of them. 
Each morning all citizens see a presentation of all noteworthy things 
and events, near and far off, a survey of the entire world, so to speak. 
Each person, too, reads and hears the comments of all on the various 
‘features of the common spectacle, and forms his own opinion in regard 
toit. The net result of this daily survey of the world and its discus- 
sion is the formation of public opinion, and this governs indirectly but — 
inevitably. The English-speaking nations are almost entirely governed 
by this agency. Continental powers, with their effective public school 
systems modeled on those of France and Germany, are rapidly coming 
into the same kind of government wherever the freedom of the press 
is encouraged. Where illiteracy is abolished and the newspaper is 
‘read by everybody public opinion gives great stability to the govern- | 
ment by preventing sudden and disastrous explosions that follow from 
government suppression. Reforms take the place of revolutions. 
THE SCHOOLS OF GERMAN-SPEAKING COUNTRIES, 
Although all the nations of Europe are largely of Teutonic stock, yet 
there have developed wide departures from the parent stock which has 
remained at home in Germany. Ina certain sense Germany furnishes a 
deep contrast to England in its mental characteristics. The modern Ger- 
man like the ancient Greek has theoretic tendencies and art tendencies, 
while the Englishman like the Roman has tendencies to will power and 
practical experiment. While it would never do to say that the Germans 
lack will or that the English lack intellect, yet to understand their differ- 
ence in character it is necessary to say that there is a very different 
emphasis placed on the two sides of mental power by the two races.. The 
tendency of the German is to think before he acts, while the tendency 
of the Anglo-Saxon is to act before he thinks. The English way is to 
learn through doing and to use its will rather than its intellect in the 
attainment of knowledge. It takes pride in making an inventory of 
the facts as it finds them where they actually exist—it prizes real ex- 
perience and original observation, and makes small account of reflec- 
tions and reasonings and a priori truths. Its national form of mental 
activity is empiricism. It knows the world as it is and not as it ought 
to be or might be. But the German, on the other hand, makes up his 
mind first and acts afterwards. This at least is his tendency. His 
mental habit is to seek out all that is known on a given question and 
. review it carefully; then he proceeds to verify this by comparing it 
with an actual inventory made by himself. He settles the object to be

attained and the proper means to be used, and then at last acts with 
_ great effect in accordance with his deliberately formed plans. — 
_ Of course there are exceptions, This is not a fixed and absolute 
difference between the two national characters. But it is the distine- 
_ tion that we must make and keep in view if we would understand the two 
trends and explain the methods followed and the results obtained by the 
two peoples. The German loves system quite as much as the French: 
~ man, only the latter looks more to the realization of his central unity 
into the art forms of regularity and symmetry, while the former looks 
‘more to dynamic features and wishes to make sure the connections be- 
tween the highest and lowest links of power and authority. While the 
English people lay great stress on immemorial usages and privileges 
that have grown up by compromises in the past, the German wishes 
"above all to have a consistent and reasonable system. It is more impor- 
tant to him that the government shall be reasonable than that there 
shall be individual freedom to act out one’s desires. and caprices. 
‘From the German idiosyncrasy it is evident why they have invented 
gunpowder and the art of printing rather than the steam engine and 
the telegraph; why they have labored most efficiently in the lines of 
comparative science rather than in the inventory of isolated data, 
They wish to see each branch of knowledge in the light of all others. 
They have created comparative philology that reveals to us the pro- 
foundest traits of mind as exhibited in the structure of language. They 
have created the science of comparative history, giving us an insight 
into the sum total of the striving of each nation that has flourished on 
the earth. They have reénforced comparative history by comparative — 
studies in religion, art, jurisprudence, and psychology. Hach new com- 
parative study gives a new critical point of view from which to.confirm’ 
or reject what has before been held. In this way the German scientific 
industry tends to reach.a stable result in the science of nature and also 
especially in the science of man. 
But this discovery of the trends of nature and human history brings 
the intellect into a condition where it decides upon the practical ques- 
tions of the day and leads to action. Having summed up the case in 
view of all the provinces in any way related to it, the will may now act 
with the most intense conviction.’ The present generation has seen a 
* new kind of national power rise into the world history out of Germany. 
Goethe said in 1792, after the battle of Valmy, where he saw a French 
army representing the people and officered by the people defeat the 
army representing the nobility and officered by them: “From this 
place, and from this day forth, commences a new. era in the world’s 
history.” Democracy would from that time be a power to be reckoned 
with. The new German empire is founded on science and means many 
things of the utmost importance to future civilization. Comparative

than that of war with surrounding nations. It delivers its decisions to 
the executive power of the nation and preparations are made in view 
of all the contingencies. An absolutely accurate survey of all strategic 
points, giving with precision every stone fence and every bridge and 
ford, the whole nation trained to military service, the means of trans- 
portation prepared so that the whole power of the nation may be con- .

frontier—these things belong to science. The intellect converts itself 
into will-power by settling in advance all problems that may arise, so 
that in the field nothing can occur that, will surprise the commander, 
_ At every point he will be stronger than his enemy. f 
The practical outcome of the rise of Germany to a new world-power. 
is the necessity of the universal education of the people. Germany, 
with its principle of the supremacy of conscious intelligence and the re- 
enforcement of the will-power by comparative science, had all along 
consistently moved towards an efficient system of education. The 
powers of the individual may be indefinitely increased by education, 
An educated nation is far more powerful than an uneducated nation of 
equal population and wealth. Education of all the people in schools 
renders possible great strategic combinations in war, commerce, and 
industry. ; 
_ It is this principle which distinguishes the modern German people. 
The Greeks were great in plastic art and literature and philosophy. 
The German is equally great in music and philosophy. His philosophy 
is based on psychology where the Greek philosophy took the form of 
ontology. The German turns science into philosophy by making it 
comparative, and thus completing a total survey of an entire province. 
Feeling this national principle at work in his soul, he finds popular 
education the most natural of all human interests to him. Studying 
the comparative aspects of Science, he becomes observant of methods. 
' He neglects this fact and that fact to look at the process by which they 
arrived. Nowhere else is there so much exercise for this quality of obser- 
vation which sees method as in pedagogy. Upon the study of method 
depends the arrangement of the course of study and the development 
from one grade of school work into the next. Upon the study of method 
depends the art of teaching and the discipline and management of the 
school, 
Germany has established all grades of instruction, from the kinder; 
garten to the university, and it enforces by a rigidly executed com- 
pulsory law the education of all its children from the age of 6 to 14, 
In chapters 1m and v prepared for this Report by a ‘specialist* of 
the Bureau it is seen how thoroughly this work of providing for school — 
education is accomplished. : 
As early as 1717 the Prussian King issued a royal edict requiring 
that all parents should send their children to school. -

    XL «REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
As soon as Frederick the Great had finished his long struggles with 
the neighboring powers for the recognition of his nation, he turned his 
attention to national housekeeping and gave a great impulse to educa- 
tion. _He began the work of secularizing education and making it a 
matter of State provision. After the defeat at Jena by Napoleon 
Bonaparte, Prussia began her reconstruction by laying new stress on ~ 
her schools. Pestalozzi’s principles were very early adopted, and the 
attention of teachers was directed to the method of arousing the 
child’s mind through sense perception. The German national character, 
as has been shown, leans in the direction of knowledge and science 
‘rather than in that of adventure and the measurement of personal 
strength by contest of will-power. ‘The German child is more docile 
than other children. He inherits a dominant love for knowledge. 
The German teacher is not hampered by the necessity of expending 
alarge amount of nervous energy on the “ discipline” :of his school. 
It is sufficient if he makes his instruction interesting. The pupils will 
not be disorderly. They ‘will conspire with the teacher rather than 
exert their will-power to oppose and circumvent him. Whereas the 
pupils in English-speaking countries have, always a primary impulse, 
not for acquiring knowledge but for measuring the strength of their 
will-power with the teacher and with each other. The Anglo-Saxon 
branch of the Teutonic family has preserved in this peculiar form the 
old heart hunger for recognition which has always characterized the 
Teutonic stock since the time of Tacitus, who described it as ‘ securt 
adversus homines, securi adversus deos,” a race that respected neither 
men nor gods. For they had a deep feeling that in the substance of 
their human nature they were divine. Hence they (lemanded personal 
recognition as the meed due them from men and gods. ‘This is the rea- 
son why Christianity took such a hold on the Teutonic peoples and why 
the Franks and the purest Teutonic-stocks adopted Trinitarian Chris- 
tianity rather than Arianism which became the religion of the Goths for 
awhile. They found the doctrine of the divine self-sacrifice of God for. 
the sake of man an act of recognition which completely satisfied their 
heart hunger, for it was an infinite personal recognition. 
The Teutonic stock that remained in Germany finds its highest satis- 
faction in the theoretical contemplation of the world as a whole—the 
scientific exhibition of reason in nature and history, while the Anglo- 
Saxon has drifted, not accidentally, in another direction and finds his 
satisfaction in the personal recognition of his power to mold nature 
to his will and to organize and govern men, chiefly lower races. It 
may be said that while the German insists on the right of private 
judgment, the Anglo-Saxon insists on the right of expressing it freely 
‘in public. ; . 
The docility of the German pupil is therefore not to be regarded as 
an artificial productof German methods of pedagogic discipline. Those 
methods fail in American schools to tame the restless, adventure-seek-

  ing youth who give character to our schools. Formerly there prevailed 
‘here in the United States a strict discipline that rested on corporal 
punishment. This has yielded by degrees to punishment founded on a 
sense of honor—the deprivation of the pupil’s privilege to sit with his 
fellows, to partake in the common class exercises, or finally the suspen- © 
sion from school altogether. The punishments have changed or are in 
process of changing from corrective punishment, which inflicts pain 
irrespective of the nature of the fault committed, to retributive pun- 
ishment, which returns the deed upon the pupil and makes him suffer — 
its consequences. The pupil by his disorder deprives himself of the 
privilege of sharing in the work of the school. 
The change in methods of discipline does not change the nature of 
the American boy from an adventure-loving to a knowledge-loving boy, 
however. But he learns to govern himself. 
The German principle leads to a very radical difference in teaching 
science and other branches. They teach comparative science, compara- 
tive history, etc., it has been said. It may be said, too, that the chief 
aim of all German instruction is to teach the philosophy of the subject. 
There shall be nothing fragmentary and detached, but all shall be sys- 
tematically subordinated to the ruling principle. The subject treated 
in view of the whole, becomes a view of the world, or rather we may say 
there is reflected in each subject as taught by the German professor, the 
entire view of the world. : ; 
Thus the German normal school demands of its graduate the ability 
to construct from his own knowledge and insight each one of the branches 
that. he is called upon to teach. He shall not depend upon the text- 
book for the matter or the form of hisinstruction. German instruction. 
insists, before all, on comprehension rather than memorizing. The pupil 
shall be led to see the inner necessity of the Subject; to see the unity’ 
which makes the whole into a system. 
Here is a great advantage that German instruction has over that of 
other nations—it gives to the pupil an instinct for anticipating the results 
of experience. Kant showed in his immortal “ Kritik” how the struc- 
ture of the mind gives to it certain “anticipations of perception.” So 
comparative study in all departments of science and history gives antici- 
pations of experience. The Agassiz or Cuvier has become so well able 
to anticipate experience, that even a fish-scale or a bone gives him with 
practical certainty the rest of the animal. Comparative study leads to 
nature’s unity, and ‘gives an insight into the necessity that governs the 
world of experience. 
No doubt this has its limits and that such apriori “ anticipation” is 
' often mistaken. But itis practically the kind of knowledge which fur- 
nishes the basis for nearly all our deeds. At all events the German 
method of instruction owes to this its distinctive characteristic and 
whatever superiority it may have, and the German pupil has accord. — 
ingly a higher gift of anticipating new knowledge than any other pupil.  
-P-A-G-E-42
  
    XLIL —- REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
In this connection is to be noted the fact that German: instruction 
discards rivalry and competition, and also that it makes less use of ‘ex-. 
aminations than the instruction of other nations. Competition in — 
studies requires that the standard of comparison be one that all grades — 
of mind can see. It must not be in the least arbitrary. This reduces 
the ‘standard to one of sense perception and memory, Only mechan- 
ical results may be measured with precision, But as German methods 
relate to the comprehension of the subject and endeavor to give the 
pupil a comparative insight into the general principles that create the 
details, it is obvious that nothing can be done in the way of applying 
mechanical tests to the pupil’s acquisitions. Hence, too, examinations 
for promotion cat not be used to good advantage. It is only the daily 
class exercise which reveals to the teacher the inward growth of the 
pupil’s power of comprehension. 
Examinations are often for the purpose of spurring the pupil to make 
review of his past work. It must be remembered-that the method of 
comparative study connects all the details in a higher unity and thus 
gives a new hold of the earlier steps at each stage of advance. The 
German method of instructién is therefore a perpetual review of the 
most valuable kind. i a 
But there is here:a drawback which other nations are ready to point 
out. The German can not prescribe set tasks for his pupils to perform 
at home—at least he can not do this so well as the pedagogues of other 
nations. The text-book system of instruction relies on the pupil’s inde- 
pendent work. He must study his book and learn to master the 
thoughts stored up in the printed page. But he will quite naturally use. 
his lower faculties of perception and memory rather than the higher 
ones of insight and critical comparison. “ Moreover, as already said, it is 
_ easier for the teacher to hold the pupil responsible for mechanical work 
a! than for comprehension. 
_ The advantage in the mechanical method of instruction is that it 
- can demand and secure independent work from the pupil—even from 
the restless and frivolous pupil who does not love knowledge. If he 
does not comprehend he can at least cram the forms of knowledge and. 
‘store them away for a possible future use. Moreover, the mechanical 
effort gives a species of mental discipline and cultivates the will power. 
It is, therefore, believed by the educators of other nations that the less 
. gifted pupils of the German school do not profit so much as they would 
under the mechanical system of instruction. Failing to comprehend 
the subject as a whole, failing to seize the soul of the comparative 
method, they remain confused and ineffective, not even retaining use- 
ful details which might have been learned by memorizing. , Whether 
the percentage of German pupils who find the School work profitless is 
as large as the percentage of corresponding classes in English schools is 
a question not determined. \
-P-A-G-E-43
  SCHooLs OF GERMAN couNTRINS, Xt 
But without a mechanical basis for classification and promotion it 
follows that the German can not lay so much stress on the grading of 
pupils as is done in other nations. . 
In this connection it is pointed out-that the, people’s schools and 
the citizens’ higher schools do not make their course of study a part 
or section of the course of study that fits the pupil for the university. 
The classics are’ commenced so early in the gymnasia that the pupils 
who graduate from the citizen’ school find a barrier in the way if they 
wish to enter the university. They must go back-and enter classes of. 
younger pupils in order to make up their Latin and Greek. This 
neglect to provide an easy transition from all parts of the primary and 
secondary work to the superior instruction is a serious defect in the 
German system. 
In the statistics given (page 164) it will be seen that the education 
of women is in much the same backward condition as in France. 
While in the primary schools the number of girls is equal to the num- ’ 
ber of boys, in the secondary schools there are four times as many boys 
as girls, while the universities are exclusively for men. 
The universities of Prussia report 22,847 students for 28,000,000 
people, while the universities of Austria report 18,405 for 23,000, ,000. 
Hungary for 17,000,000 people reports 8,106 students in urtversiGee 
‘and technical schools, while Switzerland reports 3,529 for its 3,000,000 
people. It is not stated in any instance what proportion of these 
students are from other countries. The secondary students are re- 
ported at 356,912 for Prussia; 190,196 (including also the technical and 
‘other special schools) for Austria; 89,918 (same inclusion) for Hungary; 
18,206 for Switzerland. 
There i is great difficulty in ascertaining the exact meaning of many 
items of statistics given in the reports of different countries, This will Y 
be often observed by the reader of these statements, Our specialists 
have chosen rather to run the risk of printing paradoxes than by sup: 
pressing important items of statistics to lose the opportunity of exciting 
the criticism and investigation which is sure to bring out the sifted re- 
sults for a future report. For example, we note that the normal schools 
of Prussia with a 3-years’ course enroll only 8,507 pupils, giving an an- 
nual supply of less than 3,000 graduates to fill the vacancies in a corps 
of 75,000 teachers. If the schools depended wholly on these graduates 
to supply vacancies, it would imply an average service of 25 years 
for each teacher. But the inerease of the schools alone would require 
1,000 new teachers per year. Berlin reports 108 new teachers for a 
corps of 3,000, which would give an average annual service of 28 years; 
but if 102 of these are to be deducted for the supply of new schools 
opened, the term of service would on that datum be much greater, a : 
500 years for each teacher! 
It is noted that while Prussia has 106 normal schools for men, it has 
only 8for women. But there are38 normal schools for Catholic teachers,

_ The very large number of pupils per teacher reported (70 to 80) is 
ealeulated to excite a suspicion as to its accuraey, even making allow- 
ance for the fact that the German method of instruction does not require 
so much or so eareful,an examination of the individual pupil as the 
methods of other countries. If the statistics mean that the total num- 
ber enrolled by each teacher in the year is 80 or 90, while the actual 
average attendance is much less—say two-thirds—the case is less diffi- 
cult tounderstand. Or, if there are pupil teachers who assist according 
to the Lancasterian-plan in vogue in England, the explanation is still 
better. In the United States the average attendance for each teacher 
- of the elementary schools falls below 40 pupils, and there is much outery 
on the part of the friends of good instruction to the effect that there 
should be fewer rather than more pupils assigned to each teacher. 
Under the item of sources of revenue it will be noted that Prussia 
pays 18 per cent. of the expenses of the lower schools, while the local 
districts pay the balance. It is interesting to note that the income 
from the permanent school fund provides only 6 per centum of the entire 
expenses. In the United States the permanent funds furnish only a 
little more than 7 per cent. of the entire cost of the schools. 
THE SCHOOLS OF ITALY.* 
There are two territories in Europe which have been battle grounds 
for the other nations—the lowlands north of France and the peninsula 
of Italy. England and central Europe, jealous of the power of France, 
could never permit her to extend her boundary to the North Sea, for 
that would mean the entire control of all the western outlets of Europe 
But with France confined south of Flanders, England has been able to 
hold sway over these waters and her maritime greatness is the result. 
But Belgium has been the fighting ground for English, Freneh, Spanish, 
and Austrian. So, too, Italy has been the field on which Germany, 
Spain, and France have contended for the balance of power since Charle- 
magne founded the Holy Roman Empire. Rome had been at one time 
the chief center of political power. Charlemagne gave it a new center 
jin northwest Europe. Subsequent centuries saw the attempts of the 
German Emperors to fix their capital in Italy again. But the Atlantic 
powers, Spain and France, could not permit such acombination. If Ger- 
many absorbed Italy, there would be no stability for the western powers. 
- Hence the protracted wars to settle the limits of the Empire. During 
the Crusades, the Italian cities, taking advantage of their position be- 
tween the east and west, gained great wealth and influence, securing 
by means of it their independence. Italy broke,up into small powers 
jealous of each other and continually at war. The same discord pene- 
trated each city, and there were parties within the walls ready to let 
in the common enemy in order to triumph over their fellow citizens with

whom they had feuds. Dante has given us in his great poem the reflec. 
tion of this fearful state of political chaos, and in his De Monarchia has 
reasoned out the conditions of peace for the world by forming a single 
government that swallows up all nations—a rehabilitation of the ideal 
that ancient Rome sought to achieve in the interest of her theory of civil 
freedom—all equal before the one law of the world, and the temple of 
Janus forever closed. : 
Rome has controlled the world, first politically and then ecclesiastic- 
ally. But the development of the Italian people as a people has been 
arrested by the long ages of foreign complication and the internal 
schisms incident to this prominent place in history. No people can de-. 
velop its own native aptitudes without freedom from foreign sway. 
The forward movement of modern civilization is in the direction of real- 
izing rational individualism in the form of local self-government. Thus 
it implies progress in the education of ail strata of the people from the 
lowest up. It implies the means of intereommunication and access to 
the spectacle of the mcvements of the world through newspapers and 
books. There must be a universal ability to read and the use of that — 
ability. There must be the conquest of nature.by labor-saving machin- 
ery and productive industry so that there may be thrift and wealth 
abundant—progress along these lines of the elevation of the people 
into a free participation in rational activity. This is the progress that 
“ our civilization demands, and it measures it not alone by the strength 
and wisdom of the leading classes, but by the general diffusion of intel- 
ligence and productive power among the people asa whole. The union 
of Italy under an Italian king has led to a wonderful progress in this 
latter aspect. Italy has been famous for higher education for many 
centuries. But the common people were not provided for and the 
amount of illiteracy was very great. As late as 1861, on the accession 
of Victor Emanuel to kingship of all Italy except Venetia and the Papal 
Territory, out of a total population of 21,777,331 there were 16,999, iy 
reported as unable to read and write. 
In 1871 thé number of illiterates over 15 years was reported at 69 per 
cent. This had been reduced 10 years later (1881) to 62 BEE cent,, and 
in 1889 still farther to 48 per cent. 
In no State of Europe has more strenuous effort been ide to provide 
for education by public schools. The expenditure for 1886 amounted 
to about $20,000,000, of which the national government furnished nearly 
one-third. Over 10 per cent. of the entire population are enrolled in 
school. The schools are free, without tuition fees, and a compulsory 
law insures some 4 years of schooling (since 1877) to all. This will very 
rapidly reduce the illiteracy and increase the productivity of the nation. 
The States of northern Italy, and especially Piedmont, have made by far 
the most progress in popular education, and it is noteworthy that the 
freedom and unity of Italy have come from the section where popular 
education has been most cared for.

. The reports show that the number of students preparing for the work 
of teaching in the normal schools amounts to 10,542. This fact is very » 
significant, as showing the enlightened policy of the state? in improvin g 
the corps of teachers. 
THE eobabs. SYSTEMS OF SWEDEN AND FINLAND. 
‘ Sweden: and Finland* were one country up to 1809, when Finland 
was ceded to Russia. Barly in the Protestant movement in Europe 
Sweden took measures to’ secure popular education, and in 1640 re- 
quired every city to provide a school. In 1686 the lawt of Charles XI 
prohibited marriage between parties who could not read. The law of 
1842 compels each parish to provide a school, 
It seems that 15 per cent. of the entire population are enrolled in the 
schools, there being 707,959 in the elementary, 14,030 in the secondary, 
and 1,816 in the superior grades, besides a large attendance on the 
technical schools, In fact Sweden has distinguished herself in later . 
years by her original methods in technical and industrial schools and 
in bodily training. The Ling system of gymnastics has been imported 
into America and introduced into the Boston schools, and is exciting 
wide attention here and in England. The Sléjd system of manual 
training has attracted special students from all parts of the world to 
the Swedish normal school at Niis. It originated in the home indus- 
tries practiced during the long winter evenings—feats of skill in the 
manufacture of woodenware—the jackknife being the principal tool in 
requisition. The Sléjd of the normal school has extended itself so as 
to include metal work to some extent, and so as to initiate the pupil 
into the use of tools employed in skilled labor. There is in all grades 
of the schools much attention given to preparation of boys for useful 
trades and of girls for housework. 
There is.a compulsory law thas applies to children between the ages 
of 9 and 14 years. r : 
The large sum devoted to normal-school instruction—$92,949, in 
1887, and also the corresponding sum for inspection of the elementary 
schools ($25,460)—shows the earnestness and wisdom with which the 
government acts in this matter. It would seem that nearly all children 
of school age are brought under the training of the school. 
A noteworthy feature of the schools of Sweden and Finland is the 
*« ambulatory” school. The schoolmaster in the sparsely settled re- 
gions goes from house to house, remaining a few days at each place 
and collecting in the most convenient one the children of the few fami. 
‘lies who, live near enough to attend. This suffices to teach reading 
and writing and but little more. The schoolmaster, however, can 
_ advise and direct home studies if he is intelligent. In 1871 there were 
1,164 of these ambulatory schoolmasters, there being 7,118 schools of

all kinds in Sweden, outside of Btodiehotm. In 1883 the number of i 
schools had increased to 9,794, of which 3,346 were ambulatory. 
The ambulatory teacher for sparsely settled country districts sug- — 
gests for other countries certain features worth adopting. There are 
branches of instruction in the city schools which are made efficient. 
only by skilled special teachers, such as cooking, drawing, etc. These 
can be taught in country schools by “ ambulatory ” teachers employed 
by the State Board of Education—one or two schools being visited 
each day in a circuit of five or ten schools—after a course of lessons 
the special teacher may move on to.a new circuit. 
The hygienic inquiries conducted in the Swedish schools are of para- 
mount interest. Axel Key’s report on this subject is the most impor- 
tant contribution yet made to it. One learns with surprise the effect 
of overstrain of the nervous system in the Latin schools (50 per cent, 
affected), and especially in the girls’ schools (61 per cent). 
There is evident a considerable opposition on the part of the people 
to the old classical course of liberal education. One may note in this 
connection that Sweden does not stand in such close relation to the 
other nations of Europe as to feel the pressure for adjusting herself to 
a foreign human environment of peoples differing in language, religion, 
fashions, and manners and customs. Such a necessity is met by the 
studies of a liberal education, which familiarizes the pupil with remote. 
peoples who originated the ideas that underlie his civilization, . 
The Latin and Greek life with which the student becomes familiar in 
college gives to him the source from whence are derived not only his 
own spiritual usages, but also those. of neighboring ndtions differing: 
more or less from those prevailing at home. 
The new awakening in Sweden in the matter of manual training and 
industries will have the effect of bringing Sweden into commercial re- 
lations with other nations, especially as soon as the Swedish normal 
schools come to devote a large portion of their time to art studies, 
They must emulate the French and Belgians in this respect, and take as 
much pains to form the taste of pupils on classic models as they take 
to secure skill of hand. Swedish manufactures will begin then to ac- 
quire elegance of finish and design that, will make them sought for in 
the markets of the world. 
Swedish scholars are noted for their work on the Old Norse Edda and 
the history of that early race of daring sea-rovers which made so deep an 
impression on the new civilization growing up in western Europe in’ 
the Middle Ages. 
The educators of other nations find Sweden a very interesting study . 
in the matter of education, because if is a sort of experiment station in” 
. hygiene and manual training. The contention between the ‘‘ moderns” 
and the classic studies is also nearly as active there asin France. |,

XLVIII REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
FINLAND, 
In Sweden and Finland we have specimens of the most northern peo- 
ples of Europe—of peoples, too, who are somewhat isolated and not in 
that state of military tension which prevails in central and western 
Europe. There is evident everywhere a spirit of sturdy independence 
and a willingness to Sener from ine traditional methods followed by 
other people. 
Uno Cygneus, the organizer of the new forms of primary instruction ; 
in Finland, who instituted the first normal school there, is the originator 
of the idea of the manual training school. He devised the plan when 
sent out by the Russian Government to Alaska to teach the natives, and 
after his return to Finland he was appointed inspector-general of the 
‘people’s schools, and established the admirable combination of literary, 
scientific, and industrial studies that is found there in the elementary 
schools. 
The number enrolled in school exces 1 per cent. of the entire pop: 
ulation (counting both the ambulatory and village schools). Very much 
stress is laid on the education of teachers, the sum of $75,960 being ap- 
propriated annually to normal schools, and the sum of $11,260 being 
devoted to providing able inspectors of the elementary schools. — . 
Secondary education seems also to be unusually strong—9,983 pupils 
are enrolled in this class of schools—-about one-seventh of the entire 
school enrollment. Of these it is interesting by way of comparison 
with France and Germany to see that nearly one-half of the secondary 
pupils are girls. The number of students enrolled in the universi- 
ties is 1,703, a very unusual proportion. 
The compulsory law of 1866 relates to children of the ages from 7 to 
‘14 years. It is stated that in a population of 2,225,000 the number of 
illiterates is less than 5,000. The ambulatory school of Finland seems 
to be even more efficient than that of Sweden. 
SPAIN. 
An attempt was made in this Bureau to sketch an outline of educa- 
tion in Spain.* But the sources of information proved to be meager 
and for the most part not recent. After the sketch was in type for 
chapter vu I sent the proof sheets to distinguished specialists resident 
in Madrid—Sefior Giner de los Rios and Director M. B. Cossio—the 
former the editor of the Spanish educational journal ‘Boletin de la 
Institucién Libre de Ensefianza,” and the latter at the head of the Ped- 
_agogical Museum of Primary Instruction. Sr. M. B. Cossio kindly un- 
dertook a thorough revision of the statement, and in the next Annual

Report of this Bureau I hope to furnish an adequate showing of the 
educational work done in Spain.* ‘aa 
In her efforts to establish universal education Spain vies with Italy < 
and has succeeded in enrolling in her schools about the same ratio of 
children, namely, 103 per centum of the population. 
The consequence of this movement in behalf of education has boon 
the reduction of illiteracy in recent years. 
The great comparative outlay for normal-school instruction will be 
noticed. ‘There were, in 1885, 48 of these for men and 33 for women, 
with a large number of graduates who obtained certificates. As a con- 
sequence it appears that a great majority of teachers are professionally 
edueated. Added to HSS) there is a system of inspection for every prov- 
ince. 
The number of persons pursuing secondary and higher instruction 
appears to be out of proportion to the number in the elementary schools 
and speaks well for the richer classes. The number of industrial and 
technical students (19,583) is still more significant as indicating a de- 
termination to advance the nation to the front rank of industrial com- 
petition.

  REPORT oy THE, ‘COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
  loscluaba: The ealieg of the Amazon, over 2,000, 000 square miles, i is 
almost all included within the limits of Brazil, Lying on the equator 
its capacity for the production of vegetable food is so great that it 
would support a population equal to twice the present aggregate of 
mankind. Science and machinery will some day conquer this vast 
region for the uses of man, but mere manual labor can never do it. 
AlJl the South American countries are taking a new interest in the pro- 
gress of other nations, notably in that of the United States of America 
and of France and Germany. They show great eagerness to adopt im- 
proved methods of education and whatever devices will elevate the 
people imto greater directive power in science and industry. Under the 
last Emperor, Dom Pedro, the schools of Brazil received much encour- 
agement and the quality of instruction was much improved, although 
the total enrollment reached only 2 per cent. of the population. The 
education of this number, which is a small fraction of the people when 
compared with most European nations, and indeed, as compared with 
its own neighbors of the southwest (see comparative table, pages 76,77), 
costs Brazil $5,000,000 per annum. It has developed a comparatively 
excellent system of secondary instruction. The enrollment in secondary 
and normal schools bears a large ratio to that of elementary instruction. 
Each of the twenty provinces of Brazil has its own local provincial 
assembly and takes care of its own educational facilities. There is a 
good system of superintendence and inspection provided for, especially 
in the federal district of Rio de Janeiro. The statistics from this na- 
tion are quite meager as regards its schools, and the information given 
in the authorities consists in government resolutions and proposed en- 
actments rather than in definite information as to what is bein g accom- 
plished, and its rate of progress. 
THE EDUCATION OF TEACHERS. 
I would call special attention to chapters xi to xIv* (pages 275-372) 
as giving a survey of the development and present status of normal 
schools and a supplementary study on the sociological conditions un- 
der which the teaching force of New England has been organized in the 
past 20 years, together with a glance at the new plan of the trustees of 
the Peabody fund.}| Additional matter on the subject of normal schools 
will also be found in chapter XXVI. 
  
*Prepared for this Report by Mr. Wellford Addis. 
+At the time this Report goes to press (September, 1891) the administration of the 
Slater fund has been placed under the same able management as the Peabody fund so 
as to secure perfect unity and harmony in expenditures. It would appear to the stu- 
dent of education in the Southern States that the practical wisdom in the adminis- 
tration of the Peabody fund and the fruitful results that have followed it could not 
be surpassed in the history of endowments, The Slater fund, too, has been admirably 
managed.

Attention is likewise called to the tabular views of the course of

RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN THE SCHOOLS OF THE UNITED STATES 
AND OF ENGLAND. 
The data compiled on this important subject in chapter xviii in- 
clude the replies to a circular sent out from this Bureau asking in re- 
gard to adjustments made between the parochial schools and the public 
school system. This chapter includes also a detailed summary of the _ 
report of the Royal Commission of 1886 as fo religious and moral train- 
ing in Hngland and Wales. , ; 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE LAWS AND STATE TEXT-BOOK LAWS. * 
Chapters XVII and xIx§ contain a mass of information in regard to 
the two educational subjects exciting most interest recently in our State 
legislatures. The question of supervision of education in private and 
parochial schools, the question of furnishing free text-books to all pu- 
pils, and the question of State preparation and publication of such 
books have been discussed more or less from Maine to California. It 
is believed that the compilation here given (pages 470-578) will be 
found sufficiently complete and that it will prove useful in the discus- 
sion which is still going on. 
THE LIVE EDUCATIONAL QUESTIONS. 
  In the State school reports and other documents for the year the 
chief topics discussed are, (1) Instruction to prepare for citizenship 
(page 588); (2) Country schools (page 590); (3) Education as related to 
crime (page 600); (4) Evening schools (page 601); (5) High schools

COURSES OF STUDY IN COLLEGES. 
In chapter xXvu are given the statistics of superior and professional 
instruction. A new ifem is added (item v1) showing the complete 
courses of study* for more than one hundred of the colleges of the 
country in the following subjects: Classics, mathematics and astronomy, 
English, modern languages, philosophy, chemistry, physics, biology, 
geology and mineralogy, history and political economy, and technics. t 
THE TWO CHIEF INTERESTS IN THE PRESENT EDUCATIONAL MOVE- 
MENTS, 
The educational questions which at present excite most attention 
among the people of the United States relate either to the extension of 
the free public elementary schools or to the adjustment of the colleges 
and universities to the preparatory schools. 
In those States where the public school systems are newest, as in the 
Southern States and in the States on the western borderland, it is quite 
natural that the chief educational interest concentrates on the problem 
of extending the free schools in such a manner as to provide by public 
taxation for longer school sessions, better teachers, better school build- 
ings, and increased attendance. 
In the older and richer States of the north Atlantic, including New 
England and the Middle States, there is much thought and discussion 
going on regarding the future place and function of the small colleges, 
and regarding the relation which college work holds to university work. 
There is even more interest manifested in the proper limits of secondary 
education. The question relates to the free public high school on the 
one hand and to the private endowed academies amd classical prepara- 
tory schools that furnish the greater part of students for the colleges. 
The friends of education everywhere behold the spectacle of the es- 
tablishment of the free common-school system in the Southern States 
with a feeling of pride. The extension of the system has been so rapid 
in those States and its rate of increase so uniform that all who believe 
that local self-government and universal participation in the right to 
vote must be preceded by universal education in common schools have 
reason to be satisfied with the promise for the future.

THE TWO EDUCATIONAL MOVEMENTS. LIII 
In the 13 years for which separate statistics for the white and black 
' races in the South are accessible (see page xviii), the white children en- 
rolled in the public schools have increased from 1,827,139 to 3,197,830, 
or about 75 per cent., while the increase of the ‘total white population ’ 
has been only 34 per cent. The school attendance has increased more 
than twice as fast as the population. All this hds been done amidst, 
the poverty which followed the most devastating war of modern times. 
But the education of the colored race has a still better record to 
show. In 13 years the enrollment has increased from 571,506 to 1,213,- 
092, an increase of 113 per cent., while the total colored population has 
increased only 24 percent. In other words the school attendance has 
increased more than four times as fast as the population among the 
colored people of the Southern States. 
In this same connection I mention the fact, that the attendance of 
the colored people on normal schools, high schools, and colleges has 
increased during the same period. of 13 years previous to 1890 from a 
total of 8,511 to a total of 25,540—almost exactly three times the 
former number. 
We all know that an increase in school facilities and a more ssunies 
attendance on schools means more careful supervision and improve- 
ments in methods. Teachers will manage in some way to learn by the 
experiments of their fellow-teachers. There have been during the past 
20 years many eminent men who have filled the positions of State 
superintendent and of city superintendent in that section of the coun- 
try. 
Two hundred and sixteen millions of dollars have been paid from the 
public taxes for the support of the schools, white and colored, during the 
period of 13 years mentioned. The labors of the superintendents in 
improving the quality of the teaching forces by institutes, associations, 
and normal schools have shown good results. The increase of the ap- 
propriations from $11,231,073 in 1877, to $23,225,982 in 1889, has rein- 
forced their labors by attracting a higher order of talent into the work 
of instruction, The admirably managed endowments of the Peabody 
Fund and the Slater Fund have been instrumental in improving the 
character of instruction. _ 
The devotion of the western borderlands to the cause of common 
schools may be inferred from the fact that they expend annually from 
public funds the sum of $4.11 for each man, woman, and child of the 
population for their schools—a sum nearly double the average sum ex- 
pended per capita by the rest of the United States. Butin those distant 
regions the cost of living is greater and the salaries must be larger to 
secure talent and skill in the teacher. ; 
The effort in the South now tends in the direction of increasing the 
length of the annual school term. While the number of different 
pupils enrolled in school is quite as large a proportion of the popula- 
tion in the South as in the North, and indeed somewhat larger, yet the 
 
-P-A-G-E-54
  LIV REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION, | 
number of days for the average school session is much less. While the 
North Atlantic schools average 164 days in the year, the South Atlantic 
average only 100 days. While the North Central schools average 147 
‘days, the South Central average 91 days. But the States of the South 
expend quite as much in proportion to their wealth in taxable property 
for schools as do the North Atlantic States (i. ¢., the New England and 
Middle States). But the Northwestern States exceed them in the rate 
of tax. 
Looking over the whble country we have remarked that in public 
and private schools 224 per cent. of the population is enrolled— 
13,726,574 pupils of all grades for the year 1889. The proportion in 
private schools varies with the grade of work. In the elementary 
grades it is 9 per cent.; in the secondary three times as large, or 27 
per cent.; in the superior instruction it is 73 per cent. of the whole. 
~ The total amount expended for education in the United States in 1889 
was $172,000,000, counting the amount for private institutions at $35,- 
000,000, 
THE CONFLICT BETWEEN THE COLLEGE AND THE COMMON SCHOOL. 
In the schools of the United States there prevail two different ideals 
of the course of study; the one originating with the directors of higher 
education and the other a growth from the common elementary school. 
These two ideals clash in quite important particulars. The common- 
school course of study, 4s it appears in the elementary school and in 
the public high school which gives secondary instruction, does not shape 
itself so as to fit its pupils for entrance to the colleges. At least, if we 
admit that as an actual fact many high school pupils do enter college, 
“we must also admit that there is a constant tendency in the public high 
school to diverge in its course of study and follow a path that does not 
_ lead to the college. 
The older colleges of the States, dotlawine the traditions brought over 
from Europe, built their course of study on mathematics and the classi- 
cal languages, Latin and Greek. They accordingly demanded of the 
preparatory schools a preliminary training or preparation along these 
lines, and neglected all else. 
Human learning at one period did not include much that was not 
conceived and expressed in Latin or Greek words. But within the past 
300 years there has arisen a modern tributary stredm of human learn- 
ing, and it has some time since begun its demand for recognition in the 
course of study. This modern side of human learning includes the 
  natural sciences and modern literature. These two contingents are 
‘almost wholly the product of the past 300 years. 
The demands of the sciences and the demands of the literature of the 
modern languages to a share in the course of study were met in one way 
by the college and in another way by the common school. The direc- 
tors of higher education affirmed that Latin, Greek, and mathematics
-P-A-G-E-55
  “CONFLICT BETWEEN COLLEGE AND COMMON SCHOOL. LV 
furnished the truly disciplinary studies fit for the foundation of all lib- 
eral education. Modern literature and the sciences, on the other hand, 
they said, were not and could not become culture studies, although they 
might be useful in the way of accomplishments in practical life. 
Accordingly the colleges proceeded to recognize the moderns by ad- 
mitting them only into the course of study at the end, During the 
fourth or senior year of college the student was given a rapid survey of 
the sciences and of some of the great works of modern literary art. But 
the college did not encourage the introduction of modern literature and 
natural science into the preparatory school. Consequently the pupil 
who left school during his preparatory course, or before the senior year 
of college, found himself ignorant of these two great and rapidly grow- 
ing provinces of human learning. ; 
But the public-school system has taken a different direction. It has” 
been under the supervision and management of less highly educated 
men; that is to say, of men less thoroughly instructed in the forms of 
the past, and as a result less conservative. When the moderns appealed 
for a place in the course of study, some concession was made at once 
to the demand. A tendency has been established to recognize the 
moderns throughout the course of study. First, modern literature was 
admitted in the shape of a graded series of school readers containing 
many of the gems of English and American literature, and much, too, 
that was written in mere colloquial English, and much that was trashy 
in its style and thought. 
In the geographical text-book there was an attempt at a survey of 
the world in its relations to man—the world in its mathematical fea- 
tures of size, Shape, and motions; in its physical aspects of interacting 
forces of light, heat, moisture, and gravitation; and finally in its bio- 
logical aspects of plant life, animal life, and the races of men. 
This geographical text-book also drew on the social sciences, and in- 
troduced scraps of information regarding political economy, the occu- 
pations of men, and also their political institutions, their laws and eus- 
toms, and religion. Geography has therefore developed from the be- 
ginning into a sort of compend of natural science, affording the pupil 
a survey of the results of the modern sciences, both in the physical 
and social world, 
Having yielded to the demands of the moderns in the elementary 
school in these respects, and in the introduction of a history of the 
fatherland, it remained next to emphasize this tendency still more in 
the secondary public school, and to make the high school course of 
study include more thorough work in English literature, universal his- 
tory, three or four selected sciences like geology, astronomy, physi- 
ology, and chemistry, in addition to the mathematics, and some modern 
by the side of an ancient language. 
It might be claimed that the graduate of the high school hada 
broader education ; his education, under good teachers, might even be 
 
-P-A-G-E-56

LYI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER OF EDUCATION. 
thorough, but certainly in his preparation in Latin and Greek the 
amount was not sufficient to give the high-school pupil a fair chance 
- by the side of the graduate of the special preparatory school. 
The directors of the common schools have therefore been compelled 
to establish a double course, a classical and an English course, in the 
public high school; a procedure so foreign to the spirit of the entire 
comm on-school course of study that it has only partially succeeded. 
This brief statement leads us to the source of the present problems in 
oureducation. Twenty-five years ago the requirements for admission to 
respectable colleges were much lower than at present. It was then 
possible for the high-school graduate to enter college with a good stand- 
ing. He knew nearly as much Latin and Greek as the average student 
from the private preparatory school, and he knew far more science and 
history and modern literature. These moderns gave him a decided ad- 
vantage. But there had been a widespread feeling among college men 
that the standard for admission ought to be raised until the degree of 
bachelor of arts should represent more learning and greater maturity 
of mind and body. The bold action of some of the ablest college presi- 
dents set into more rapid motion the demand for more work in the pre- 
_ paratory schools, and the consequence has been the general elevation 
of the standard of admission to college by about one and one-half to 
© two years. : 
The results of this change have become slowly apparent. ‘There has 
followed a wider separation of the higher education in the United 
States from its public-school education. The preparatory school has 
been forced in to fill the place that the college formerly held, and the 
result is not felt to be salutary. This difficulty has been increased by 
the rapid multiplication of public high schools, which now number some 
4,000. The numerous smaller colleges having given up a year or more 
: of their work to the preparatory schools feel very keenly the loss of 
students. Inasmuch as the larger colleges have developed into univer- 
sities, there is evident the beginning of a crusade against the small 
_ college that will force it to step down into’ the work of secondary edu- 
cation and renounce the work of higher instruction. This result, in 
fact, is unavoidable if the present high standard for admission is re- 
tained. But it has been discovered by the leading minds who are 
directing our higher education that there are very strong reasons 
against this course. It is possible that there may be a change that 
will return the college to its old place in the educational system, and 
this will save all the small colleges for the useful work which they have 
so long and so faithfully accomplished. This same move would likewise 
— restore the college to a harmonious relation to the public high school. 
Indeed it would bring about a better adjustment than has ever been 
before. For the elevation of the standard for admission to college has 
been accompanied to some extent by requirements of preparation in 
moderns; some modern literature and French or German, together with
-P-A-G-E-57
  
    
CONFLICT BETWEEN COLLEGE AND COMMON SCHOOL. LYVIt 
some acquaintance with science, are demanded. Hence a slight approx- 
imation of preparatory courses of study to that of the high school has 
been effected, If this tendency is preserved and accentuated in the 
change of the requirements for admission, there may come about a 
complete adjustment of the higher education to the eommon-school 
education and an inestimable advantage accrue to the people; for it 
is certainly a calamity to have the youth of the land diverted from the 
institutions of higher education. 
Although it is uncertain what decision will be taken by the directors 
of our higher education, I may mention another phase of the matter 
which bears in favor of the return of the colleges to the old standard of 
admission. This is the recent development of a genuine university 
course, above the traditional college course. 
It is to be remembered that for a long time there have been generous 
endowments of institutions of learning by rich men. In fact, the peo- 
ple of. the United States are very proud of their Johns Hopkinses, 
Tulanes, Peabodys, Purdues, Licks, Drexels, Clarks, and Stanfords. 
Nearly an annual average of $10,000,000 is given as endowments to 
various forms of higher education. The net result of these endow- 
ments may be summed up as the creation of real university work. 
The old college did not know how to manage the years of post-grad- 
uate study. The fellowship endowments were paid to brilliant students 
who had carried off the honors, but who had worked rather for those 
same honors than for the sake of learning and insight. Left to them. © 
selves, without the stimulus of class work, those post-graduate students 
soon lost their zest, and unless they entered the professional school 
gained very little in their subsequent residence at college. A reform 
of the greatest importance was inaugurated by organizing post-gradu- 
ates into classes for original investigation in.the form of laboratory 
work and of seminaria wherein critical research was taught and learned. 
At once there sprang up a new and superior order of professors, 
which has been superseding step by step the type of college pro- ~ 
fessor that formerly prevailed. The new university-trained professor 
has a very much improved method of instruction, even if his work hap- 
pens to bein lower schools. He carries that higher method—the method 
of investigation—into practice with his students and their work becomes 
far more profitable. ? 
Now itis this discovery on the part of our leading colleges of the 
true character of university work that has brought about the feeling— 
or let us say is in process of bringing about the feeling—that it is not 
necessary to include all higher education in the college. There should 
be a fourth stage of education, that of the university, quite beyond the 
education of the college, and its characteristics should be those of spe- 
cialization and original investigation. 
The work of the college may be improved by an infusion of the higher 
methods, but its essential character must not be changed. 
 
-P-A-G-E-58
      
LVI REPORT OF THE COMMISSIONER Of EDUCATION. 
The elementary school will always have the character of memory 
work stamped upon it, no matter how much the educational reforms 
may improve its methods. It is not easy to overvalue the impulse of 
such men as Pestalozzi-and Froebel. But the child’s mind can not 
seize great syntheses. He bites off, as it were, only small fragments of 
truth at best. He gets isolated data, and sees only feebly the vast net- 
work of interrelation in the world. This fragmentary, isolated char- 
acter belongs essentially to primary education. But just as surely does 
secondary education deal with relations and functions and processes. 
It is the stage of crude generalization. But college education’ strives 
‘to superinduce on the mind the habit of seeing the unity of things. 
The curriculum of the college is therefore called the philosophical fac- 
ulty, using the word faculty in the French sense of the word faculté. 
The college rounds up the youth’s view of ‘the world and gives him 
an idea of the articulation of the various branches of human knowl- 
edge. But the view of this unity is both deep and shallow at the 
same time. It is shallow because the student has and can have only a 
hearsay knowledge of the many branches of human learning. It isa 
deep view because the idea of the organic unity of knowledge is always 
the deepest idea that can arise in the mind of man. 
It has been contended by some of our educational leaders in the 
States that this phase of education, which is founded on the. search 
_for unity, is a spurious phase of education, and they would therefore 
ms willingly relegate all of the college work to the preparatory school 
and commence the work of specialization and original inyestigation 
at once after the secondary school, or even in the secondary school 
itself. 
But these zealots do not duly consider the fact that the only tran- 
sition between the theoretical and the practical, that is to say, between 
the intellect and the will, takes place through the act of unifying or 
summing up one’s knowledge. A rational man is bound to act in view 
of all the circumstances. The inventory.of any field of reality can 
never be exhausted, but the practical man must act. When he acts 
he must stop investigating further and sum up the case; he must 
declare the evidence to be allin and decide what to do from what he has 
already learned. This is the transition from the intellect to the will. 
The college has in the past cultivated exclusively this frame of mind, 
which looks for the unity of knowledge and gives an ethical point of 
view to one’s thinking. It will be needed to cultivate the same ethical 
habit of mind in future, although it will require to be supplemented 
by the spirit of investigation ‘and verification which the university 
method brings with it. For we must learn both these methods in — 
-order to become liberally educated. We must be observant of the 
trend of things and gain the power of insight into the rational unity © 
underlying all things—this is essential to practical wisdom ; and on the

CHAPTER I. 
GENERAL STATISTICAL EXHIBIT OF EDUCATION IN THE 
UNITED STATES FOR THE YEAR 1888-89, 
A.—GRAND TOTAL OF PUPILS. 
[See Table 1, pp.5,6.] 
The educational system of the United States enrolled 13,726,574 
pupils of all grades! during the school year 1888-89, or an average of 
about 224 to each 100 persons of the population. 
Of these, 12,325,411, or 89.8 per cent., were enrolled in schools and 
institutions under public management, and 1,401,163, or 10.2 per cent., 
in schools and institutions under private management. 
As regards grade, 12,931,259, or 94.2 per cent., were receiving ele- 
mentary instruction ; 668,461, or 4.9 per cent., secondary instruction, 
and 126,854, or 0.9 per cent., superior instruction. Elementary instruc- 
tion will be understood to include what are commonly known as the 
“primary” and “grammar” grades, and secondary instruction the 
“high school” grade, of both public and private schools. 
The actual average number of pupils in each grade for each 100 per- 
sons of the population, classified as public and private, also geograph- 
ically, is as follows: i.

  2 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
Elementary instruction.—As regards elementary instruction, it will be 
seen from the above that in the public schools the North Central States 
have the greatest number of pupils as compared with the total number 
of people (21.88 per 100), andsthe North Atlantic States and Territories 
the least (16.66 per 100). 
The South Atlantic and South Central States surpass the North At- 
lantic in the proportion of population enrolled in elementary public 
schools (19.01 and 19.49 against 16.16); but the reverse is the case as 
regards the proportion of school population enrolled ; it isimportant to 
keep in mind this distinction, which is more fully referred to elsewhere. 
In elementary private schools the North Atlantic States are far in the 
lead (2.54 pupils per 100 of population); the Northern States surpass 
the Southern generally in this particular, and the Eastern States sur- 
pass the Western of the same latitude. In other words, private elemen- 
tary schools are most prevalent in the longer settled, the more densely 
populated, and, it may be said, the more educationally advanced sec- 
tions. 
Taking the elementary pupils all together, public and private, the 
Western Division has the fewest in proportion to the total population 
(18.13 per 100), This does not necessarily imply that there has been 
less progress in education there, since that division has by far the 
smallest proportion of children in its population. That portion of the 
country has been in great part only recently settled, and adults still 
form an undue proportion of the population. In the North Central 
States a profusion of children, of material resources, and of educa- 
tional enterprise, are found co-existing, with the result that those States 
make by far the best showing as regards elementary schools, enrolling 
23.95 pupils per 100 of population. 
‘Secondary instruction. —In public high schools the North Atlantic 
States have by far the greatest enrollment (1.14 pupils per 100 of pop- 
ulation); the North Central States are credited with .66 per 100; and 
the Western States with only .25 per 100 (25 per 10,000), or about one- 
fifth of what the North Atlantic States have. 
This may seem surprising, but it is in accordance with the reports to 
this Office. The last Report of the Commissioner of Education (1887- 
88), p. 73, gives for that year in the North Atlantic States 6.4 per cent. 
of the common school enrollment as enrolled in high schools; in the 
North Central States, 2.9 per cent.; and in the Western States only 
1.5 per cent. : 
While the Western Division is in the lowest position as regards public 
high schools, it is in the highest as regards private secondary schools. 
This may be ascribed to the numerous schools established in the Terri- . 
tories by the different religious denominations. As regards the remain- 
ing States, the Eastern (North and South) stand above the Western 
(.35 and .36 per 100, against .31 and .22),
-P-A-G-E-63
  
GENERAL STATISTICAL EXHIBIT. 3 
Superior instruction—The classification of institutions for superior 
instruction into public and private is not altogether feasible. In point 
of fact, some of the institutions classed as public in compiling this sum- 
mary are not public in the sense that the common schools are, though 
the majority of them make an approach to being so. 
Taking superior instruction of both classes together, and including 
normal schools, it may be seen from the table that, compared with the 
population, there are more higher-grade students in the North than in 
the South, and in the Hast than in the West of the same latitude. The 
North Atlantic States lead with 25 students per 10,000 of population. 
The South Central States have the smallest proportion, 16 students 
per 10,000, or about two-thirds the number of the former group. 
It may be said that 1 in 5 of the whole population of the United 
States is under elementary instruction, 1 in 100 under secondary in- 
struction, and 1 in 500 under superior instruction. 
Relative number of pupils in each grade.—Leaving the absolute values 
and considering only the relative number of pupils in each grade, it 
appears that 94 per cent. of all pupils are in the elementary grade, 5 
per cent. in the secondary grade, and 1 per cent. in the superior. The 
details are as follows: 
Per cent. each grade is of the whole.

Public and private schools—The proportion of instruction furnished 
at the public expense becomes less, the higher the grade. In the ele- 
mentary grade, 91 per cent. of the pupils are in public schools, and 
only 9 per cent. in private; in the secondary grade 72 per cent. are in 
public schools, and 28 per cent. in private; in the superior grades only 
27 per cent. are found in public schools, while 73 per cent. appear in 
private schools. Leaving out normal schools, the proportion of public 
students in the superior grades would be still less. 
The following table exhibits the relative number of public and private 
school pupils in the different grades and geographical sections. As just 
intimated, the normal school attendance, which is mostly public, affects 
the percentage of superior instruction considerably, especially in the 
North Atlantic States,

B.—GranpD TOTAL OF EXPENDITURES. 
[See Table 2, page 7.] 
The total amount expended for educational i bye ieee and pri- 
vate, in 1888-89, was $171,739,317, or an average of $2.82 per capita of 
population. 
Of this amount, $135,737,600, or $2.23 per capita, were expended 
upon elementary schools ; $19,258,491, or 32 cents per capita, upon sec- © 
ondary schools; and $16,743,226, or 27 cents per capita, upon superior 
institutions of learning. 
The following table gives a detailed classification of the per capita ex- 
penditure. The expenditure for higher grade institutions includes the 
amount expended for the preparatory or academic departments. It will 
be observed that there is a much greater contrast between the North 
and South as regards expenditure than there was in the case of pupils, 
owing to the expenditure per pupil being much less in the South.

TABLES AND DIAGRAMS SHOWING THE PROGRESS OF THE COMMON 
SCHOOLS. 
Sources whence the material was derived.—The following tables and 
diagrams have been prepared to show the growth of the common schooi 
system of the United States since 1870. The figures given are based 
upon data derived from the school reports of the various States and 
Territories covering the period in question. ‘Those for 1889 are approx- 
imate, as has already been observed, and may need a slight future cor- 
rection, ; 
The files of some of the State reports are incomplete, especially those 
of the Southern States; and the reports existing contain often very 
meager statistical information, reporting perhaps only one or two items 
in the earlier years, and those probably for only one-half the counties 
in the State, or less. Many anomalies and inconsistencies occur in 
these reports. 
All the available statistical material has been collected, and examined 
as thoroughly as was practicable. The text of the State reports*was 
examined when it seemed necessary, in the progress of the work, in 
order to obtain any information bearing upon the subject that would 
be of assistance in making a trustworthy estimate, in case of official 
Statistics being missing or unreliable. 
The Southern States.—The reports of the Gulf States in particular 
during the first half of the decade 1870-80 are fragmentary and un- 
reliable. The reports of average daily attendance aud of the value 
of school property are almost entirely wanting; while the reports of 
the average length of school term, when there are any. such, and of
-P-A-G-E-70
10 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89, 
  _other items, are characterized by strongly marked fluctuations and an. 
omalies, the effects of which are graphically depicted on Diagram IV 
(p. 19), in the lines of the two Southern Divisions, during the years 
870-74. In fact, all the figures for these two divisions, as given in the 
following pages, must be considered as more or less unreliable until 
about the year 1875, at which date the school systems of the Southern 
States had in general passed through their formative period. 
Uniformity striven after.—Effort has been made to render the statis- 
tics homogeneous. This is especially requisite in the case of school 
expenditure. What should be reported as “expenditure” is a matter 
of custom or opinion. In these tables are included only the expendi- 
tures for public day schools up through the grade of high school—that 
is, schools giving primary and secondary instruction. Expenditures of 
public moneys for evening schools, normal schools, teachers’ institutes, 
superior, special, and professional schools, and schools and institutions - 
for the defective, dependent, and delinquent classes have been deducted 
when possible, though sometimes it has not been possible, on account 
of detailed reports not having been made.. Also the amount expended 
for the payment of indebtedness has been excluded whenever known; 
it has been frequently shown that this is not an expenditure for educa- 
tion. : 
POPULATION. 
Statistics of population.—The population, except for the census years 
1870 and 1880, has been estimated. The census of 1890 has been used, 
in connection with that of 1880, as a basis for computing the population 
since 1880; the State censuses of 1885 and other years have also been 
utilized. The figures given in the following table will be found sufii- 
ciently reliable:

@ The population is given for same epoch as the enrollment, expenditure, ote; hence that for 1889 will need futuro correction, as the popalation of some of tho States for 1888 entere into this total. See Chap. XXII. 
Relative number of school children.—In finding what proportion the 
school children 6 to 14 are of the total population, a great difference is 
observed in different sections of the United States. This isan impor- 
tant fact, and needs to be emphasized. The more children there are in 
any given number of the population, the fewer will be the taxpayers,
-P-A-G-E-71
  GENERAL STATISTICAL EXHIBIT. 11 
and the greater will be the burden of providing each child with common 
school education. The accompanying diagram shows graphically the 
number of children 6 to 14 years of age in each 100 of the population.

I.—Diagram showing the number of school children 6 to 14 years of age in every 100 persons in 1880. 
The shaded parts represent the children 6 to 14, the unshaded all other persons. 
It is seen by this that it is in the Southern section of the Union that 
children most predominate, in the South Central States over 22 out of 
every 100 persons being children 6 to 14 years of age; in the North 
Central Division the proportion of such children is less, being 19.5; in 
the North Atlantic States still less, 17; and in the Western Division, 
including the Pacific States and Territories, least of all, 15.9. It will 
be noted that the proportion of children is greatest in those sections 
where the per capita valuation of property is the smallest; the greater 
number of children to educate exists where there is the least means 
for educating them. 
In individual States the contrast in the relative number of children 
is still more striking. Montana has 11.4 children in each 100 persons; 
Mississippi 22.9. Evidently if Mississippi had the same proportion of 
her population enrolled in the schools as Montana, she would have only 
one-half the proportion of her school population enrollea. In order to 
gain a correct idew of school enrollment in these two States, for instance, 
it is essential that it should be viewed under both these aspects, 1. e., in 
its relation (1) to the total popalation and (2) to the school popu- 
lation. 
The inequality of burden arising from a small or an excessive number 
of children is brought more prominently into relief by considering the 
number of the school population of 6 to 14 years to every 100 adults; 
i.e. by comparing the number of children to be educated with the num- 
ber of persons there are to provide the means for education for them.

cumstance may be noted that in the South Central States each 100 
adults have nearly twice as many children dependent upon them for 
education as do the same number of adults in the States and Territories 
of the Western Divisiov, the numbers being 50.7 and 28.3 respectively. 
In individual States here also the contrast would be still more striking.

rollment of pupils in common schools since 1870; the data of the latter 
table are also graphically represented in Diagram ITI (p. 14). While 
the table gives the facts with greater numerical accuracy, the diagram 
presents more clearly to the eye the status of-the different geographical 
divisions with respect to each other, andsthe changes that have taken 
place from year to year. 
The diagram shows what percentage of the total population was en- 
rolled in the common schools. The most noticeable feature presented 
by this diagram is the growth of common schools in the South. 
Beginning with an enrollment of less than 8 per cent. in 1870, the two 
southern divisions rise almost uninterruptedly in the scale... The South 
Atlantic passes above the Western Division in 1880, and the South 
Central above the same in 1883. ‘heir course is still upward in 
the main, until in 1889, with an enrollment of about 20 per cent., 
they both stand above the North Atlantic Division, which has 17.8 per 
cent. 
Hardly less significant, though not so much a matter of common 
knowledge, is the decrease of the proportion of the population reported 
as enrolled in the common schools in the two northern divisions. This 
movement of decrease has been going on almost continuously since 
1870, until in 1889 the North Atlantic Division has fallen below every 
division except the Western. Tho final dip downward (from 1888 to 
1889) is very noticeable. The detailed table, given in Chap. X XIX, 
shows that there was an absolute decrease in the enrollment of Maine, 
New Hampshire, Vermont, and Rhode Island from 1888 to 1889, while 
the enrollment of New York and New Jersey was almost stationary, 
the school population at the same time increasing rapidly.

It may be of use to inquire to what causes this apparent or real fall- 
ing off is due. It is not possible to make any exact statement in this 
regard, but the following agencies have undoubtedly operated during 
the last two decades to decrease the public school enrollment as re- | 
ported : 
(a) The more rigid exclusion of duplicate enrollments from school re- 
ports in recent years.) 
(b) The rapid extension of the private school system. A continually 
increasing proportion of pupils attend private schools, with the result 
of diminishing public school attendance by so much. During the year 
1888-89 the estimated private school enrollment of sixteen States in- 
creased at the rate of 7.10 per cent. per annum, while the public school 
rate of increase for the same States was only 1.44 per cent. 
(c) The growing tendency to refrain from sending children to school 
at so early an age as heretofore. The number of pupils under five 
years of age has decreased in Massachusetts during each of the last 
ten years. Six years is coming tobe considered soon enough to begin 
the public school education of children by other than kindergarten 
methods, and in many cities children are not permitted to attend until. 
they have reached that age. On the other hand, in Massachusetts at 
least, children do not leave school at as early an age as heretofore—a 
consideration tending to increase the enrollment. The resultant effect 
would depend on whether the average number of years children remain 
in:schools is increasing or diminishing. 
(d) The gradual change in the character of the population. With the 
growth of manufactures the class of factory operatives, largely of for- 
eign extraction, has more and more predominated. There has been an 
influx of French Canadians and of Irish into New England, all largely 
Catholics of the humbler classes, and neither element is calculated to in- 
crease the public school attendance. The census of 1890 will probably 
furnish valuable material for study in this connection. 
The circumstance that the decline in the proportion of the population 
enrolled in the public schools of the Northern States is coincident in 
point of time with the introduction of compulsory attendance in the 
great majority of those States’ is noteworthy. Yet compulsory laws 
have had very little to do with the matter. Except in Connecticut and 
in certain municipalities in perhaps half a dozen other States, compul- 
sory laws have been entirely inoperative, and have had no effect on 
  
1£,g.: The Massachusetts School Report for 1888-89 says (p. 56) that previous to 
1879 a system of reports was in use under which some of the pupils were counted 
more than once. 
2The compulsory education system of the United States is in the main the growth 
of the two last decades. Previous to 1870 there were compulsory attendance laws 
only in Massachusetts, Vermont, and the District of Columbia, and these were of a 
crude character and had never been thoroughly enforced. Laws for suppressing 
truancy, and restricting the employment of children of school age to labor had, how- 
ver, been passed before 1870 in Connecticut and a few other States,
-P-A-G-E-76
  16 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
attendance one way or the other, except it may be a temporary one 
immediately following their first enactment; in some cases their very 
existence is unknown to or has been forgotten by most persons. 
Where they have been enforced, in the most advanced educational 
communities, they are applicable to only a small percentage of children. 
Most children either voluntarily attend the public schools, or are edu- 
cated elsewhere, or are legally exempt, In such communities a rigid 
enforcement of the law would increase the school enrollment by only a 
a slight ratio, and even of the few brought into school under compul- 
sion a majority will perhaps select private schools as their place of at- 
tendance.! 
“Tn any given year a larger percentage of children may be kept from 
school by a contagious disease or an inclement season than the entire 
percentage atfected by the law, and hence its influence, so far as shown 
by statistics, be wholly lost sight of.” 
In aword, the influence of compulsory laws upon school attendance has 
been either zero, or else so slight that in the most favorable cases it may 
be more than neutralized by such agencies as those just referred to. 
(e) The low proportion of children of school age in the total popula- 
tion must not be overlooked in considering the small school enrollment 
in the North Atlantic States. This was noticed on p. 11. It is possi- 
ble that the census of 1890 will show a still smaller percentage of chil- 
dren of school age. How can the fact be explained that in the enlight- 
ened State of Rhode Island only 15.4 per cent. of the population are 
enrolled in school in 1888-89, save through absolute lack of children? 
The average percentage of enrollment, for the United States rose from 
17.8 per 100 in 1870 to 20.1 per 100 in 1875. It was during this period, 
in a great measure, that the common school systems of the South were 
organized. Since 1875 the increase of enrollment in the South has only 
been sufficient to compensate for the decline in the North, and the re- 
sultant enrollment of pupils in the United States has remained at about 
20 per 100, or 1 in 5 of the population. 
The North Central Division occupies altogether the highest position 
as regards the proportion of the population enrolled (22.6 per 100), 
while the Western Division was in 1889 the lowest (17.1 per 100). The 
proportion of the school population enrolled, however, is another matter. 
Children are most numerous in the South, as has been shown, and a 
high percentage of the total population enrolled may coexist there with 
alow percentage of school population (six to fourteen years) enrolled. 
In point of fact, a diagram giving the percentage of children of school 
age enrolled, would show the North throughout standing far above the 
Socth.

Average daily attendance—The growth of average attendance has 
more than kept pace with that of enrollment, so that, for a given num- 
ber of pupils enrolled during the year, for each 100 for instance, the aver- 
age number attending daily has progressively increased, considering 
the United States as awhole. From 59.3 in 1870, the number has risen 
to 65.1 in 1889, as shown in Table 7. These numbers may also be in- 
terpreted as showing how many days on an average each pupil enrolled 
attended school out of every 100 days the schools were in session. 
This increase of regularity of attendance has been most marked in the 
North Atlantic and North Central Divisions ; to such an extent, indeed, 
that the falling off in the proportion of population enrolled in those di- 
visions has been nearly counterbalanced, and about as large a propor- 
tion of the population attend daily on the average now as in 1870,

Length of school term.—The lines representing the changes in the 
length of the school term in Diagram IV are somewhat irregular. On 
_ the whole, there has been a,decided gain in the two northern divisions 
_ since 1870. The sudden decrease in the North Atlantic Division in 1884 
was due chiefly to a law changing the time of the close of the school 
te year in New York State, and in a lesser degree to an unusually short 
school term that year in Pennsylvania. 
_ The upward movement of the line of the Western Division from 1874 - 
to 1875 is very noticeable; this upward slope chronicles the improve- 
i ment effected by a change in the school law of California, establishing 
a new rule for apportioning school moneys, by which every school dis- 
trict, no matter how few the children, received a certain minimum 
amount—enough to keep their schools open at least six months. 
In the South Atlantic Division the length of school term decreased 
almost continuously from 1870 to 1879. ‘This may be considered as the 
result of the establishment of ever-increasing numbers of country 
schools, with shorter terms than the city schools, thus bringing down 
the general average length of term, without, in, fact, the terms of any 
particular class of schools having been shortened. Here averages are 
liable to mislead unless their true charatter and significance are kept 
well in mind. 
The increasing length of term in the two northern divisions men- 
tioned above, it may be added, is due in part to the increasing proportion 
of city schools. The whole school system of the United States, in fact, 
is gradually taking on a more urban character, and from this cause 
alone 'the average school term, average wages of teachers, average per 
capita expenditure, ete., should show a progressive increase, without 
there being necessarily any actual increase in either city or country

schools, the increasing average being solely due to the changing pro- 
portion each class of schools forms of the total. Hence the necessity 
arises of a classification of most school statistics for certain purposes ~ 
into those of city and country schools. Such a classification is also 
needed to do justice to the agricultural and thinly populated States. 
The line of the North Atlantic Division, for instance, appears on the 
diagram far above all the others, on account of the large proportion 
of city schools in that section. In a comparison of city schools alone, 
or country schools alone, other sections of the country would prob- 
ably equal it. 2 
The line exhibiting the length of school term of the South Central 
Division is very angular, especially in its earlier stages. Several ele- 
ments enter in to produce this. In 1870 the line represents principally 
the average school term of only four or five States, in which school sys- 
tems had been established, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, and Ala- 
bama, and in a less degree Louisiana; then followed the establishment 
of systems in Mississippi and Texas, beginning with city schools of 
long terms, by which the average was raised until 1872; then followed 
a decline, as noted in the South Atlantic Division. 
These were contributing causes; still a part of the vagaries of this 
line must be considered as due to the uncertain and incorrect reports 
of the average length of the school term of that period which are upon 
record, as well as to changes in the method of computing it adopted by 
different superintendents. . 
During the decade just closed the’ Southern States, like the Northern, 
_ show an increase in length of school term, There should be a well- 
marked progressive increase, as the school systems of the South are 
gradually taking on a more urban aspect.

_ Value of school property-The value of school property per capita of 
population has exhibited a well-defined increase in every section of the 
Union since 1870, This movement of growth has been in the main con- 
tinuous, except in the interval from 1876 to 1880, during which there 
was a decided decline in the Northern and Western States, the increase 
in the value of school property during that time not keeping pace with 
the increase of population. _ ; 
This falling off in the per capita value of school property from 1876 to 
1880 is attributable in part to the shrinkage of values then going on, 
which produced only an apparent decline, and in part to an actual dimi- 
nution of activity in the matter of building schoolhouses; the school re- 
ports of that period indicate that the Northern States were then passing 
through an era of economy and retrenchment, in which school expen-

ditures were brought down to the lowest point; at such a time expenses 
for building are among the first lopped off, along with useless or extrava- 
gant expenses of a miscellaneous character. The State superintendent 
of Illinois in 1878, while calling for economy, holds up to view the fact 
that a seventy- five, dollar schoolhouse had been fitted up with light- 
ning-rods at an expense of sixty-five dollars. : : 
The statistics of school property in the South have been very defect- 
ive, but the main features of the situation outlined in Table 11 and Dia- 
gram V are essentially correct. There may be observed in that section 
(1) a steady gain in school property over the population; and (2) a loss 
when compared to the average attendance, until within a few years, 
during which the value of property per capita of average attendance 
has undergone a decided rise. The indications are that the South is 
entering upon a period of schoolhouse building, especially in the cities.

EDUCATION REPORT, 1883-89. . 
  -Expenditure.—The accompanying tables and diagrams exhibit very 
fully and clearly the amount of money expended for public schools 
since 1870, and its relation to the population and to the average at- 
-tendance. The periods of increase and decrease of expenditure stand 
_ out prominently in the diagrams. The concurrence of these at the same 
epochs of time in different sections of the country is remarkable, and 
points to a widespread similarity of circumstances and conditions tend- 
ing to produce liberality or economy in school expenditure simulta- 
neously over a large extent of territory. The parallelism of the lines 
of expenditure is especially marked in Diagram VIII, giving the ex- 
penditure per capita of average attendance, in which no one of the 
division lines crosses another. 
In the Northern States a period of maximum per capita expenditure 
occurred about the middle of the last decade; from that time on until 
about 1880 considerable decrease took place; after 1880 a rise again, 
which has been going on to the present time; the maximum which oc- 
curred in 1875 or 1876 has already been exceeded in all the northern 
and western divisions, with no indications of coming to a standstill. 
The action is intermittent, but the general resultant isa gain. This 
_ marked increase of expenditure per capita of population in the Northern 
States is one of the most noticeable facts developed by an examination 
of the educational statistics of those States for the present decade. 
The amount expended per pupil is now largely in excess of what it has 
been before, and the upward movement is still going on. 
The decline in the comparative expenditure of the Northern States 
from 1875 to 1880 may be attributed to a reaction which followed upon 
the flush” times succeeding the war. A period of profuse expenditure 
was followed by a period of retrenchment and economy. There was 
also a shrinkage of values going on, so that the same tax-rate would 
produce from year to yeara smaller revenue. In three years the prop- 
- erty valuation of Massachusetts fell off nearly $240,000,000. 
This falling off in the per capita expenditure from 1875 to 1880 in the 
Northern States, however, did not result in any diminution of the 
amount of schooling given. The schools were maintained as before, 
but the wages of teachers were lowered, and fewer buildings were con- 
structed. There was where the retrenchment took effect. For instance, 
in the North Atlantic States the average wages of male teachers de- 
ereased from $54.67 in 1874 to $43.28 in 1880; of female teachers, from 
$34.67 in 1874 to $30.08 in 1880. The effective falling-off in wages was 
not so great as these figures would show, as the purchasing power 
of money was increasing. The decrease of activity in the building of 
schoolhouses at this epoch will become apparent from an examination 
of the diagram of school property, p. 22. 
The Southern States, equally with the Northern, ee a characteristic 
group in the matter of school expenditure, of which the distinguishing 
feature is the small amount expended per capita, as compared with
-P-A-G-E-89

the North. From 1871 to 1879 there was a net loss in the South in the 
expenditure per capita of population. This was a formative period, a » 
time of change and of experiment; school systems were formed and 
reformed; in some instances systems were copied in exienso from the 
North, only to be laid aside and replaced by others better adapted to 
existing local circumstances.. Moreover, much of the money nomi- 
nally expended for schools was diverted into other channels, and teach- 
ers were often paid in notes or certificates which they were obliged to 
dispose of at a ruinous discount. 
Since 1879 there has been in the South a nearly continuous, but very 
slow, increase in the expenditure per capita of population, showing 
that the expenditure is slightly outstripping the population; it is, how- 
ever, barely keeping pace with the average attendance, as will appear 
from Diagram IX.

Proportion of wealth expended.The number of mills expended for 
common schools for each dollar of assessed valuation is given in Table 
16 for the years 1870,1880, and 1889, and the same facts are represented 
graphically in Diagram IX. The design is to furnish an answer to the 
questions, What proportion of their wealth were the people of the dif- 
ferent sections expending for public schools at such and such a date, 
and Was that proportion increasing or decreasing? If the line slopes . 
downward in the diagram the proportion was decreasing, as is the case 
withthe proportion of the assessed valuation expended in the North At- 
lantic and North Central States from 1870 to 1880; this does not imply, 
of course, that there was less absolute expenditure or a less per capita 
expenditure, but a less proportion of actual wealth expended. 
The rapid development of education in the South shows itself also on 
this diagram. Both the southern divisions commence in 1870 at a low 
point. In 1889 the South Central States are found expending more 
relatively of their wealth than the North Atiantic States, and the South 
Atlantic only a trifle less.

The results recorded in this table and diagram are somewhat vitiated 
on account of the different rates of assessment prevalent in the differ- 
. ent States. The rate of assessment in two or three of the North Cen- 
tral States is particularly low, which serves to raise the position of that 
section somewhat higher than would otherwise be the case, though it 
does not affect the increase or decrease of the Division itself; the slope

L.—DISTINCTIVE FEATURES OF AMERICAN AND GERMAN SCHOOLS, » 
WILH HISTORICAL REFERENCES. 
The German “ people’s school” is a historic growth. Its beginnings 
date back a thousand years, but not until the time of the Reformation 
\ did it assume the shape of a school for the masses; not until then did 
it draw into the pale of its influence the lower and lowest strata of soci- 
ety. Ithas at all times felt the influence of political, religious, and

  social commotion and had to accommodate itself to the ruling spirit of 
the times. A frequently quoted political axiom in Germany is (in 
literal translation): ‘He who has the school commands the future.” 
irom being the handmaid of the church, as in Luther’s time, the Ger- 
man school—to use a collective title—became a powerful auxiliary of the 
state at the beginning of the present century, a time of political dis- 
aster, and ever since it has, mirror-like, reflected the different phases 
of the political life of the nation. 
While there are many points of similarity between the German and — 
the American school, yet the German school is not a common school. In’ 
this respect the “ primary school” in France, in theory at least, comes 
much nearer our ideal than the German “ people’s school.” 
Germany has been for more than a thousand years (with short inter- 
vals) an empire consisting of more or less independent sovereign states. 
lence the establishment and management of schools in Germany are, 
as in this country, matters of local concern, like all other matters not 
pertaining to the defense of the nation or its intercourse with foreign 
powers. The schools are supported partially by the state; partially 
by the communities. 12.02 per cent. of the expenses are borne by the 
state, which thereby derives the right of legislation regarding courses 
of study, supervision, ete.; 87 per cent. of the expenses are borne by 
communities, which secures them the choice of sites, erection of build- 
ings, and election of teachers; endowments and even private enterprise 
contribute something to this work. The government of the German 
schools is a most intricate affair, since there is no uniformity except in 
ike people’s schools. There is nowhere in Germany a system of national 
schools such as was contemplated by the foremost thinkers of the French 
Revolution, or is desired and advocated by German reformers of to-day. 
Though a powerful sentiment is now awake in Germany to make 
the schools of the empire truly national in character and organization, 
free of charge, and common to all; and though many teachers, mindful 
of the social tendency of the nineteenth century, are supporting the idea 
of a common school (“ Hinheits-Schule”) for Germany, first of course 
for each separate state, it is a fact that as yet there is a-great variety 
of schools in existence, perhaps a natural outgrowth of the independent 
mode of thinking of the people. The people’s school (Volks-Schule) in 
its extent, organization, management, and results, perhaps, is the near- 
est approach to a common school. 
This, then, must be borne in mind when contemplating the structure of 
the German schoolsystem. The variety of schools of which itis composed 
is so great that it puzzles the collector of statistics who has to classify 
them, about as much as the nomenclature of American private second- 
ary schools does. That the differentiation in German society must be 
reflected in its schoolsis self-evident, if we consider that in a monarchy an 
aristocracy is an absolute necessity. _.A king of citizens of equal social 
rights is an anomaly. A monarch must needs have a pedestal, which is

found in an ascending seale of society. The American common school is 
the expression of social democracy, hence itis a contradiction to the mo- 
narchical system. 
IL—STfATISTICS OF THE SCHOOLS OF PRUSSIA, 
. Different strata of society in Germany have different schools. For the 
purpose of comparison they may be classed in three groups. 
(A) Lower schools, or the people’s schools so called. They are purely 
: elementary and attended by both ‘sexes. 
_ (B) Middle schools : (a) the citizens? schools for boys, (b) the girls’ acad- 
“emies. Both are more extended in scope and course than the people’s 
schools. } 
(C) High schools; (a) the ‘Realschule,” (b) the “Gymnasium,” (c) the 
“Real-Gymnasium.” These are the schools which prepare for the uni- 
versity and polytechnicum. 
This classification in three groups, lower, middle, and higher schools, 
is somewhat arbitrary, but it is convenient and sufficiently minute for 
practical purposes. Though there is a great variety among the schools 
_ in each of these groups, itis particularly puzzling in Group II, middle 
schools. . 
  The subjoined diagrams may illustrate the organization and ayaa 
nature of the German school in contradistinction to the simplicity of or- 
ganization of the American school. Since reliable and minute statistics 
from all states of Germany are not available, those of Prussia, the lead- 
and largest state, are used as a basis of comparison. It is reasonable 
to suppose that they are indicative of the essential facts in other parts 
of the empire. 
The population of Peas according to the census of 1885, was 
. 28,318,470. This number is'taken because no satisfactory estimate for 
1887 fi published, and the school statistics graphically presented in Dia- 
gram II are of the year 1887, the latest available to this Bureau. Ac- 
cording to the information at hand there were—

(a) Besides the 4,874, 347, children between six and fourteen years — 
enrolled in the people's aallogls there were 170,439 children (between six, 
and fourteen) who had either not entered eahaot yet for reasons un- 
known (perhaps physical weakness), or had left school before reaching 
the maximum age. 
(b) Thirteen thousand five hundred and nineteen did not attend the 
people’s schools, being either idiotic, blind, deaf, or otherwise crippled. 
These unfortunates can be found accounted for in reports of institutions 
for the blind, deaf, and imbecile. j 
(ce) Hight Yiousand eight hundred and twenty-six children hag to be ' 
denied admittance for want of room. 
(d) Three thousand one hundred and forty-five children were not even 
enrolled, despite the fact that school attendance is compulsory. 
The total number of children between six and fourteen was 5,369,500. 
If we deduct from this total the numbers under a, d, ¢, d, it leaves a 
total of 5,163,627 children enrolled in either people’s schools or elemen- 
tary classes of other schools. If we add to the total the number of 
students in middle and high schools, namely, 203,310 and 153,602, we 
find the total number of youth actually enrolled, in schools between 
kindergarten and university to be 5,530,539, or 19.51 per cent. of the 
population. 
The numbers given are the numbers of pupils enrolled. If the num- 
bers in attendance were known we should see that the percentage of 
the population is considerably less. The difference between enrolment. 
and attendance is, however, much less than in the United States. This 
is attributable partly to the density of population (Prussia occupies not 
quite three and one-half times the area of the State of Ohio; its density 
of population is 209 to the square mile, while that of Ohio is 82), which — 
facilitates schoo] attendance, and partly to the rigid enforcement of the 
compulsory attendance law. ! ih 
How many children attended the private schools, marked in the dia- — 
gram as preparatory classes, can not be stated in detail; the official re- 
ports give the total number (203,310) only. There are also select 
private schools in Prussia, of which the official reports give no definite 
information; but it is reasonable to suppose that the number of their 
  
Privy councilor, Dr. K. Schneider (director .of public elementary schools in 
Prussia), writes in answer to an inquiry from this Office concerning the number of 
pupils in daily attendance: 
“In reply to your letter of November 20, 1889, I take pleasure in saying, that 
though daily registers of the pupils in the schools of Prussia are kept, and the roll is 
read daily, we have never heretofore made statistical summaries concerning daily 
attendance. Generally, it may be said, the attendance is quite regular (owing to 
the strict enforcement of the compulsory attendance law) ; I believe I am not saying 
too much, if I state that of the 4,874,347 children enrolled in the people’s schools on — 
May 20, 1€86, as many as 4,400,000 were actually in attendance.” ? 
 
-P-A-G-E-96
_ Schools with one teacher...    
86 : EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89.” 
pupils would not increase the foregoing total often to raise v to 20 
per cent. of the population. 
Despite compulsory attendance in Prussia the number of supine in the 
‘different school systems tapers off somew hat, as is seen on Diagram II. 
This is owing to natural decrease by death, and to the fact that poorly 
endowed children fail to be promoted; they reach the fourteenth or 
thirteenth year of age before having entered the highest. grade of 
school, In rural schools attendance is enforced only between the ages 
six and thirteen, while in cities the limit is generally the fourteenth 
year. The falling off in attendance upon the higher classes of sec- 
_ ondary schools in Germany is owing to a great extent to the 
methods pursued in these schools. It does not seem the object of the 
faculty to do the greatest good to the greatest number, but to prepare 
a selected few for the next higher grades and snffer the remainder to 
stay and go over the same ground or drop outof school. The statisties 
of German secondary schools illustrate Darwin’s theory of the survival 
of the fittest. 
_ The number of children in the kindergarten can not be stated Riis 
to the fact that nowhere in Prussia has the kindergarten become an 
integral part of the school system. It is almost every where supported 
independently of state aid. In the United States it has only at a very 
few places been organically connected with the common school, hence 
no adequate uniform reports are available even here. | 
This Bureau has attempted to collect statistics concerning the at- 
tendance in kindergartens in this country, but they proved to be frag- _ 
mentary. The space which represents the/kindergarten in the first 
two diagrams is mere conjecture and must be regarded as such. 
IIL—OTHER ITEMS OF INTEREST CONCERNING THE PEOPLE'S 
SCHOOLS IN PRUSSIA. 
The official school statistics of Prussia, which are very carefully com- 
piled, offer the following additional items of interest : 
The 4,874,347 pupils enroiled in people’s schools are found in 34,016 
-schoolhouses with 75,097 class rooms. There were in 1886-87:

_ Within fourteen years from the issue of the decree which organized 
the schools anew (January, 1872) a notable progress, that is to say, a 
_ better grading, has taken place. This progress, though slight, is made

There were 26,289 schools graded in two classes in purely rural dis- 
tricts in 1887; there were 1,187 schools of six, and 290 schools of seven 
and more grades, a total of 1,477 fully graded schools; these had 16,140 
class rooms. The proportion of rural or ungraded schools to city 
or graded schools is :

Schools. with two teachers.. 18. 64 
Schools in rural districts. 54.15 — 
City graded schools 45. 85 
100. 00 
Hence less than one-half of the Prussian children were enrolled in 
graded schools; more than one-third in entirely ungraded schools. 
Dr. Schneider, in discussing these figures, says: 
Itisan undisputed fact, that the ungraded schools, manned as they are, with well 
trained graduates of normal schools, accomplish very satisfactory results. * * * Skill, 
endurance, professional zeal, and last but not least, the greater physical strength of 
their teachers are naturally of beneficialintluence. ‘* * * It is well to remember, 
then, that the graded city school is not under all circumstances, and hence should 
not brevi manu be considered the better school. 
An American author who inspected the Prussian ‘cross-road schools,” 
remarks : 
Lexpected to find in them results such as may be found in the school of an Amer- 
ican backwood settlement, primitive in the extreme. But I was greatly mistaken. 
What I saw was admirable work and almost incredible results. 
In 1887 the Prussian people’s schools had 64,750 teachers (male and 
female) and 1,303 assistants, the latter preparing for their diplomas. ° 
Industrial handicraft for women was taught by 34,270 female instrue- 
tors, of whom 5,496 had passed their examinations, while most of the: 
others were wives of country school teachers, ‘The neanes of pensioned 
teachers was 4,211. That is, for every 20 teachers of graded schools 
and for every 14 teachers of ungraded schools, there was one pensioner. 
The salaries paid in 1887 to the teachers of people’s schools amounted 
to 75,000,000 marks (about $19,000,000), hence the average salary was 
1,162 marks (or about $300). To this should be added the rent, for 
nearly all teachers in Prussia live in schoolhouses or dwellings belong- 
ing to the school; if not, an average equivalent for rent is paid by the  
-P-A-G-E-98
          EDUCATION REPORT, isss-80. 
’ a community. If the rent be counted in as 20 per cent. of the income, the © 
- . average salary would be about $360. 
Forty-four million marks (or $11,009,000) were expended in 1886 for 
the erection and improvement of buildings. Most schoolhouses in cities 
are of recent origin, as is seen plainly from the following statements: 
From 1874 till 1882, 5,975 new buildings were erected and 2,710 build- 
ings were enlarged, at a total cost of 117,000,000 marks ($29,250,000). 
From 1883 till 1886, 3,977 new buildings were erected and 3,975 build- 
‘ings were enlarged, at a total cost of 104,000,000 marks ($26,000,000). 
Highty-seven per cent. of the cost of erection was defrayed by the 
- communities, 13 by the state. The city of Berlin alone spent 1,375,000 
marks ($343,750) in eight years for new school buildings, which seems a 
very moderate sum if compared with the efforts made in this direction 
in large cities of this country ; but it must be borne in mind that this sum 
excludes all middle and high schools and only includes “ people’s 
schools” (that is, elementary schools). The entire amount spent for 
_ thé people’s schools in Berlin (1886) was $4 million marks (a little over 
$2,000,000). 
Dr. Schneider makes a curious statement which may cause astonish- 
ment in this country, namely, that seventy is considered the “ normal 
number of pupils” in graded schools, eighty in ungraded schools. 
These “normal” numbers do not indicate the facts as they are, for 
46.1 per cent. of the pupils of the kingdom (2,233,373) sat in over- 
crowded class rooms, ¢. e., rooms which held more than the “ normal” 
numbers mentioned. The different provinces of the kingdom differ 
greatly in regard to this point. Thus, for instance, 91.85 per cent. of 
the children of Berlin were seated in class rooms that had no more than 
the normal number, while other districts ranged as low as 29.13 per 
cent., 27.83 per cent., and even 15.70 per cent. 
The cost per capita in Prussian people’s schools is stated for a few

IV.—A FOREIGNER’S VIEWS OF THE GERMAN SCHOOLS, ‘ i 
In 1886, Dr. R. Laishley, officer of public instruction in New Zealand, 
was sent to Europe to study the school systems there and report his 
observations. His report was published, and the views it contains 
 
-P-A-G-E-99
  GERMAN, AMERICAN ‘AND PRENCIE SCHOOLS coMpPARED. 89 py ad fe 
about the German schools are worthy of reproduction since qaey, betray > 
rare penetration. i 
Dr. Laishley says, under the head “ Result of Investigations: ” 
The results of what I have heard, seen, and read induce me to believe— 
- (1) That the Germans, in pursuance of a policy to become the strongest of all nations, 
by excelling in civil as in military affairs, have concluded that, in order to secure 
    the most successful results possible from national education, thorough discipline of — 
mind and body is indispensable; and to facilitate this that there must be at least —(a) 
consideration for the feelings of (virtually) all in religious matters; (b) local gov- _ 
ernment, including regulation of religious instruction (subject to the protection of 
minorities), of direct local taxation, of expenditure, and of administrative details; 
(c) religion (subject to certain conscience-clause provisions) considered as the basis — 
of instruction, and therefore placed as the primary subject on elementary school pro- 
' grammes; (d) compulsory attendance laws; (e) thorough qualification of all teachers 
for private as well as for public schools; (f) and recognition of the greatimportance 
* of gymnastic exercises. r 
So that in Germany, as in Switzerland, we find friction between the State and 
‘ the citizens in religious matters provided against; religion, universality, thorough- 
ness in detail, thrift, and, adaptation to local circumstances provided for by local, 
government, and compulsory-attendance laws; physical strength and vigor pro- 
moted by gymnastic exercises; and discipline established and maintained and cor- — ; 
rect information imparted, in the most systematic mode possible, by thoroughly qual- 
ified teachers. The consequence is education—not merely instruction—is carried out 
under most favorable circumstances, with no thwarting undercurrent of religious or. 
local influences. 
(2) That preéminent attention is paid to scientific knowledge in all the higher 
institutions, and to the study of philosophy in the universities; and 
(3) That extreme exactness and minuteness are insisted upon. 
‘These three points require a few more comments. Consideration in religious inate 
ters is granted under peculiar circumstances, viz, (a) as in Switzerland, there are 
differing nationalities and languages; (b) districts in which the, majority are de- 
voted to a particular religion other than that of the greatest number of the nation; 
and (c) amongst the learned classes—the thinkors, and therefore the rulers of national 
action—an almost universal spirit of scepticism in matters pertaining to Christianity. 
We, however, find the learned classes not tyrannically enforcing or insisting upon 
their own tenets, but exemplifying (a) that whatever conclusions they may have ar- 
rived at ought not to be arbitrarily imposed upon others; (6) that tyranniéal action in 
matters of religion is not only unjust and impolitic if the utmost limits of ascertain- 
able truth are to be reached, but death to national peace, and hence to national hap- 
piness; (c) that the only policy worthy of a great nation in religious matters is not 
merely toleration, but consideration for the present feelings of (virtually) all; (@) 
that such universal and thorough disciplinary processes, by means of local machinery 
and otherwise, should be provided as will enable each person to obtain the discipline — 
and knowledge requisite to form just conclusions on religious and all other truth and 
error; and (e) that in order to attain that object theze should be no friction, no reli- 
gious bitterness, no chafing or undue interference with liberty of thought oraction in 
matters of individual or primarily local concern, and a removal, as far as practicable, 
ofall influences which may, by being irritating, prove hostile or obstructive to the 
grand aim in view—training a naturally hardy people to sound views and able and - 
vigorous action, 
The discipline secured by thordugh training of teachers is very sopann Tt isrec- 
ognized as enabling (a) a wider range of subjects to be coyered, and (b) a thorough 
mastery of them, and (c) such a digesting of what is taught as Son not otherwise 
be possible.’ Indeed discipline insuring the estimating of everything at its exact

value seems to be a preéminently excelling feature of German PAU AUTOR Se feature 
more real in Germany, in my opinion, even than in Switzerland, 
There is liberal expenditure in the promotion of gymnastics. It is recognized that 
without such physical exercises the extreme severity of the examinations would not 
be practicable, except to detriment the physical and mental health, even in the bracing 
climate of Germany. And it is widely admitted that even the present attention to 
- gymnastic training is not sufficient to prevent ‘ overpressure,” as evidenced by de- 
fective eyesight, ete. 
Taseribe the virtues mentioned to the influence of the preéminent study of philos- 
ophy in the universities, and to the exceptional division of the nation into so many 
independent sovereiguties; the former cause producing, amongst the ruling classes, 
(a) a clear perception of what renders a nation happy, and (b) how such happiness 
is to be attained, and the latter ‘a sort of emulation” whereby the improvements 
_ realized at any one point were gradually adopted by the entire nation. For in Ger- 
many we find (a) in religious matters the feature of the greatest skepticism with 
the greatest consideration; and (b) that the study of philosophy has resulted in 
such national culture as has enabled Germany to take strides in recent years in 
warlike and peaceful pursuits as are elsewhere unknown in Europe, which creates 
~ belief that the study of philosophy should bea prime element in any national system 
of higher culture. 
The extreme exactness and minuteness referred to would seem to be a blemish, an 
unhealthy dissipator, rather than a conservator for the accumulation and digestion 
of knowledge. But whether this should be guarded against by counter healthful 
action, in the form of increased muscular exercise or otherwise, or remedied by a dim- 
inution of particularity, it is here, of course, outside of my province to discuss. 
_ General features.—Some further information on general features is now given: 
(1) Elementary education in day schools is compulsory for all children, from the age 
of six to that of fourteen, unless competent instruction is being obtained elsewhere; 
and subject, of course, to temporary absences for valid reasons; which reasdns are 
very similarin all the States. Applications for permanent exemption, however, are in 
proportion rare, ‘for there are comparatively few private schools, and little private 
tuition; the children of the rich being tutored generally, when not at primary schools, 
at preparatory gymnasia before going to secondary schools proper. Default in attend- 
ance is punishable by fine or imprisonment; but generally itis uncommon. 
Children are duly protected against injurious (including premature) employment. 
‘There is no regulation, other than those relating to compulsory attendance, which 
defines school age, or limits attendance. But, of course, there are certain.ages when 
it is considered that pupils should/attend a certain grade of school or learn certain 
subjects, and the gradation of tuition is considered to be excellent. For instance, in 
Berlin the usual rule is, (a) infant school from the age of two to six; (b) preparatory 
- gymnasium, six to nine; (c),gymnasium course—with Latin from nine, with French 
from ten, with Greek from thirteen, with Hebrew from fifteen and sixteen; and 
thence to university. In real schools the same ages apply, substituting English, and ~ 
_ stress on mathematics and natural science for Greek and Hebrew. In many State 
gymnasia, for instance, throughout Prussia and in Leipsic, the course is for nine years 
preparatory for the university, which pupils usually enter at the age’of nineteen or 
. twenty; but they must pass the final examination at the gymnasium before entering 
the university, 
(2) Religious instruction is given in secondary as well as primary schools. To show 
further how essential it is considered it is laid down, as affecting Saxony at least— 
“The Volksschule has for its object the religious training as one part of universal 
human education.” Such instruction is given as the local managers of a school (who 
represent the inhabitants of a district or parish) decide, whether they be Protestant 
or Roman Catholic, with, however, liberty for those nonconeurring to retain er 
children from school | during the period of religious instruction.

(3) Elementary edneation is not gratultons, as a rule, except for those who can not 
afford to pay for it; and in secondary schools instruction is not, as a rule, given free 
of charge, except in the case of scholars who are not only too poor to pay, but have 
distinguished themselves, when gratuitous instruction is generally available. In 
some schools, however, there are only a certain number of free places; but to these, 
in some cases, in consequence of royal and private legacies, free dinners and suppers, 
or free dinners, are attached. Fees, however, are in all cases low. Generally chil 
dren have to buy school books, unless in cases of poverty. 
(4) Although the gradation of schools is not in all places the -same, infant schools 
are.generally the first (although not a compulsory) grade; and these children gen- 
erally attend from the ages of two to six, but they are by no means always State 
schools. Indeed, infant schools are not favored in.Germany; they tell you ‘it is 
settled by all the medical authorities that children have no business to begin to learn _ 
before they are six years old.” In the land of Froebel I expected to be impressed 
with the perfection of the kindergarten schools, and to find them form a part of 
state education. In both respects, however, I was disappointed. The infant schools 
I saw did not excel in discipline or intelligence those that I visited in England and 
elsewhere; and although they, like all others in Germany, are subject to Government 
inspection, probably their voluntary character has some bearing upon the absence 
of special excellence. They are in Germany considered advantageous institutions, 
although a lady there, the wife of a professor, told me that she regarded them 
with disfavor because rich people send their infants to them instead of giving the 
children the superior advantage of home influence and training; and even were it 
not so, she considered them as only good to the extent of keeping the children off 
the street, because she is of opinion that they cause children to dislike both play ais 
work. An experienced school inspector in Germany, although considering the schools’ 
in question distinctly desirable, also told me that adanger of such ecHoas was found 
to be that the children acquire habits of playing in school which they carry into the 
primary schools. Instruction is not gratuitous, the fee charged being generally 
about three marks per month. 
(5) Primary day schools (Volksschulen) are the first ‘compulsory atuge of German 
education; but many parents have their children educated at the commencement in 
a preparatory gymnasium (Vorschule), where they remain till about the age of nine, 
when the secondary school course Gommences. Class numbers,are generally regulated 
by law. There are no standards, but the time table is a part of the school law and 
the school regulations of the country. Home lessons are usual. There is nothing 
special to remark concerning school buildings. except re in the cities they are yery 
, fine, 
(6) Supplementary (continuation) schools (Fortbildungsschulen), Sieh are vir- 
tually secondary schools held in the evenings and on Sunday mornings, are every- 
where the next stage, and are especially intended for deepening and extending the 
‘knowledge of apprentices after leaving school.. But these only apply where a child 
does not attend a secondary school. Attendance at these schools in many States is 
compulsory, but not so everywhere. In all cases some preparation for industrial oc- 
cupations, is taught inthem. Instruction in supplementary schools is not in all States 
gratuitous, although where not gratuitous the fees are always low. In Prussia all 
tuition is charged for in some, and in others French and English alone are charged for 
as extras. In Saxony, on the other hand, there is no charge made. The half time 
system does exist, but to no great extent. 
(7) Publie secondary schools, which are almost always day schools, exist in all the 
States; but there is not everywhere the same gradation. Where the organization is 
complete they, and the higher educational establishments, mainly consist of: (a). 
preparatory schools (Vorschulen) for children from about the age of six to nine; (by 
* modern schools (Realschulen) preparatory for the upper modern school and the nal 
technic; (¢) upper modern (Ober Realschulen), in which there is no Latin taught, 
      
 
-P-A-G-E-108
  polytechnic school; (f) universities, of which there are twenty exclusive of the acad- 
emies of Miinster and Braunsberg, which provide the ultimate course of instruction. 
In all secondary and higher schools in Prussia fees are charged; but the main sup- 
‘port of such schools accrues from the State or municipality. So in Saxony, where 
: ‘the fee is £6 ayear. There is no provision at the public expense for the secondary 
‘education of girls in some States, but in Berlin, at all events, in the case of a girl 
~ who has distinguished herself at a primary schoo] and whose parents are too poor to 
continue her education, the State pays 48} marks per annum for her tuition at a pri- 
vate school. Science and art training, but especially science, are everywhere fos-— 
tered. Workshops are not yet introduced into the primary schools, but drawing'is 
therein universally and well taught, and there are apprenticeship schools, ‘ 
_ The regulations to insure thorough qualification of all teachers are strictly abtsnaes 
There are no pupil-teachers, In the Royal seminary at Berlin for training-masters, 
‘pupils must be at least sixteen years old upon entering, and they are not allowed 
to teach before they have at least attained the age of nineteen and have passed 
their examination satisfactorily. The education is not gratuitous, except for those 
- who are too poor to pay, in which case it must also be shown that the applicants’ 
testimonials are good. There are probably at this institution 20 free places out of 
' accommodation for 200 pupils. Admission to a normal school can only be obtained 
after passing an examination, and the term of study there varies from three to six 
“years; and religious instruction is included in the course, There are some normal 
_ schools for the training of mistresses, although they are not so numerous as those for 
masters, ‘‘ Because in German countries women are much less used in teaching than 
“men. This is especially the case above the three or four lowest classes. They think 
that many of the subjects in the classes above are not fit to teach.” And Mr. M. 
Arnold thinks the result satisfactory. A part of the training in all such schools ae 
sists in practising teaching under the guidance of a preceptor. The main duty of a 
“head teacher in Germany is considered to be that of supervision, and therefore he un- 
dertakes only a limited number of lessons. The salaries are very small, and no part of 
the pay isdependent upon examination or attendance results. Pensivuns are granted, r 
but deductions are made from salaries for the pension fund; and there are also vol- 
-untary benefit associations formed by the teachers for provision in case of sickness 
or death. t 
_ Theschool year runs from Easter to Easter, and important examinations, both writ-. 
ten and oral, are arranged to take place before Easter and Michaelmas. On the 
“results of examination depends the promotion of students from one class to a higher. 
‘Inaddition to ordinary inspections, each primary school in every third or fourth year is 
“carefully inspected by an expert member of the board of education. There are no 
state scholarships in primary or secondary schools. Scholarships are provided only 
i in the universities by Royal or private legacies, and are not awarded unless to 
scholars who combine the two conditions of (a) being poor, and (b) having distin- 
guished themselves; and even then the scholarships are comparatively very small, 
In all States private as well as public schools are under state supervision ; and 
_ where the teacher does not possess the necessary diploma from a “‘ Wissenschaftliche 
Priifangs-Commission,” he must hold one from a seminary or normal school. i 
Not only is there as a rule aschool library for pupils,‘but a school library 1 for 
_ teachers, as a part of the regular apparatus of a school. ; 
Material differences between States.—The material differences between some States i in 
educational matters relate principally to the (a) gradation of schools; (b) conditions 
relative to providing religious instruction; (c) payment of or freedom from fees ; (a) 
compulsory attendance at supplementary fishoolds and (e) university regulations— 
as, for instance, at Leipsic and Jena, where students unable to pay may, by petition, 
obtain leave to attend without fees, :

V.—-Srattsrtes OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN AMERICA. 
The population of the United States in 1887 was estimated. at 
58,713,000.! The common schools, including primary, grammar (or inter- 
mediate), and high schools, had enrolled in the same year 11,884,944 
pupils. This is 20.38 per cent. ofthe population, or about 1 per cent. 
more than in Prussia and about 6 per cent. more than in France. If 
we add to this the percentage of students in secondary institutions not 
belonging to the common schools, such as academies, colleges, Gs 
namely, 0.35 per cent., the percentage rises to 20.73. 
While this would seem a very flattering state of affairs, it must be 
stated that the number 11,884,944 is only one basis of computation, 
inasmuch as it represents the entire number of pupils enrolled. Another 
basis of computation is found in the average number of pupils attending. ‘ 
That number is considerably less than the number enrolled, namely, 
7,682,000, or 13.09 per cent of the population; or, with the addition re- 
ferred to, 13.44 per cent. But since the basis of computation which ¢ 
yielded the percentage in Prussia (17.2 and 19,51 per cent. respec- 
tively) is the number enrolled, or “inscribed,” as the technical term is 
in Germany and France, the same number must be used for the United 
States. 
VI.—CRITICISM OF THE AMERICAN SCHOOLS, 
Dr. R. Laishley gives much prominence in his report to the American 
schools. He first sets forth the main principles recognized in the 
United States as relating to education; then sketches in bold, but es- 
sentially correct, lines the organization of the common school and the 
efforts in behalf of secondary instruction, indulges in some criticism 
which seems fair, coming from an outsider, and then concludes his 
report by saying: 
In the American system there is much that induces commendation; especially (a) 
Large powers of local government, inclading powers of direct local taxation. (b) 
Compulsory attendance laws so far as they exist, although they exist only to a lim- 
ited extent. (c) The promotion of technical instruction, including prominence given 
to drawing. (d) The requirement in certain States respecting the knowledge of the 
influence of alcohol on the human body ; and (e) The provisions, as far as they ex-" 
tend, against the improper employment of children. But public education in the 
United States has not arrived at that condition which justifies its imitation as a complete 
system. 
For instance, respecting the States generally, there exists the want of adequate 
provisions affecting, (a) school accommodation, (b) compulsory education, (¢) length 
  
1We purposely choose the statistics of the year 1887, though those of 1888 are at 
hand, in order to afford a fair comparison with Prussia and France, the latest availa- 
ble statistics of which are of 1886-37,

- of school terms, (d) training, standard of qualification, and appointment of teachers; 
eo mO) religious instruction, (f) physical training, (g) inspection, (h) infant school ar- 
‘rangements, and (i) injurious employment of children; involving an unjustifiable 
amount of illiteracy, incompetent teaching in too many cases, religious friction, and 
avery general absence of that thoroughness, without which veneer is apt totake the 
place of substance—causes which, as it seems to me, must, if unamended, not only 
retard the progress, but sap the core of any nation. 
_ There must, however, be much to learn, even if there be not everything to imitate, 
for apart from the large questions which may, with especial advantage, be studied 
in connection with the States, and in addition to much that may be commended, to 
arrive at a clear perception of error, must be a distinct gain. Moreover, the immense 
‘mass of data on educational subjects not only relating to the States, but to all parts 
of the world, annually collected and gratuitously distributed by the Bureau of Edu- 
" cation is indeed a most valuable contribution and aid to educational progress, and 
deserves to be extensively and gratefully availed of, 
    VII.—THE SCHOOLS OF FRANCE. 
Until recently France has had no system of schools that admitted of 
a comparison with those of the United States. Since the year 1871, or 
since the beginning of the new republic, however, France has made - 
ea greet progress in public education. Indeed its efforts in behalf of com- 
‘ _ mon school education have been so enormous, and their results so as- 
y  tonishing, that a comparison with the efforts in our own country seems 
quite proper. 
... The population of France in 1886 was 38,218,903. As will be seen 
from Diagram III, the primary elementary school there extends its course 
s over only six instead of over eight years asin Prussia and here ; but this 
_ course is followed by a two or three years’ course in superior elementary 
) schools, which may be said to be still in their infancy. The elementary 
schools are preceded by the maternal or infant schools, institutions simi- 
lar to but not identical with the kindergarten in Germany and the 
United States, only with this vital difference, that they are organically 
connected with the primary school. Hence, definite statistics concern- 
ing their number of pupils are not lacking as in Germany ard America. 
These infant schools in France had in 1886-87 741,224 pupils, which 
number represents nearly 2 per cent. of the population. 
The primary elementary schools, institutions similar to the German 
people’s schools, contain 5,487,589 pupils in 1886, or 14.45 per cent. of 
* the population. Now, 14.45 per cent. is about 6 per cent. less than in 
the United States and 2.77 per cent. less than in Prussia. If the fact 
is considered that the course in the elementary schools is two years _ 
(respectively, one year) shorter than in Prussia, the apparent discrep- 
ancy between these two countries vanishes, and it would seem that com- 
‘pulsory attendance works out a corresponding result. Again, if we 
were to deduct all the pupils over twelve years in this country, the 
percentage would fall lower than it was stated (20.38 per cent.). 
> The addition of the extremely small number of pupils in France who 
' avail themselves of the advantages offered in the superior elementary

  Since we have for the United States and for Prussia excluded in our 
calculations the kindergarten and university, we must do likewise for 
France. 
The French elementary schools, primary and superior, are attracting 
the attention of other nations in no small degree. They are not'only — 
endowed lavishly and provided with costly apparatus, such as is found 
neither in the American common schools nor in German people’s schools, 
but an experiment is at present being made in connection with them, 
the progress and results of which are watched closely on both sides of the 
Atlantic, to wit: The Government has decreed that manual training be » 
introduced as an integral part of the curriculum. In 1887 100 of 174 
boys’ elementary schools in Paris had commodious workshops for work _- 
in joining, turning, wood carving, and forging. 
VILI—CRITICISM OF THE FRENCH SCHOOLS. 
Dr. Laishley, whose views have been quoted on German and Ameri- 
can schools, expresses himself quite fully in regard to the French school — 
Ste Mee He says— 
The present state system, as revised by the laws of the 16th of June, 1881, and 28th 
of March, 1882, should be a peculiarly interesting study, as being the most absolute 
one existing of gratuitous, secular, and compulsory education. And the enactments 
just mentioned, which entirely changed the main features of primary education in’ 
France, were passed by reason of the views prevailing there, that ‘‘in France the 
preliminary condition of all progress was the secularization of education: ” and that 
the laws in question ‘would enable France to resume the march onward which wag 
begun by the revolution of 1789.” 
The great education question, which has been agitated in France for some years, 
has been whether the priesthood, or the bulk of the people, shall have the dominating 
influence 6ver popular education. The people have prevailed ; and accordingly edu- 
cation in all the national educational establishments is exclusively secular. And by 
the law passed in 1886 ‘‘in public schools of every description all instruction is to be 
given exclusively by laymen.” Whether this will eventually be profitable has yet to 
be proved; inasmuch as the legislation is too recent to enable the system to be deemed 
yet other than as an experiment in France. But meantime the friction is obviously 
great; and hostile influences bitter and powerful, 
Special featwres.—The special features connected with this system appear to be— 
(1) The eager national intention to render it as perfect as possible; (2) In pursuance 
of that intention, the munificent, indeed, the lavish, expenditure upon education; 
(3) The absence of any religious’ feature, but the system purports to be absolutely 
neutral in, and not hostile to, religion; (4) The special attention paid to the promo- 
tion of industrial training by means of gratuitous schools, classes, and lectures, and 
                
 
-P-A-G-E-112
     
    EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89, Monneen 
_ especially the grafting of such training upon ordinary primary school education Sie 
(5) The organization of, and provision for, teaching and inspection in infant schools 
and classes; and(6) The remarkable percentage of attendances at the primary schools. _ 
- The state, far more absolutely than elsewhere, controls the complete education of the 
people. * * * 
Gratuitous and compulsory phases.—Instruction in all primary, including infant 
; schools, is now gratuitous. School necessaries also are provided without charge; and 
in Paris penny dinners are provided by the municipality, which dinners, in the case 
 ofreally poor children, are gratuitous. There are no separate free schools for paupers, 
as in England. 
: Compulsory attendance now applies to all children from the age of six (complete) 
to that of thirteen (complete).!_ If, however, they are receiying instruction at home, 
- or at a private school, or obtain a ‘‘cortificat d’études” (which is possible to obtain 
at eleven), they are exempt. In respect of this certificate, Matthew Arnold says: 
“The boy who gets a ‘certificat d’études’ has, I think, been better trained and has , 
i more to show for his schooling than the boy who has gone through the standards;” 
whilst the royal commissioners for technical instruction state that the examination 
_ will probably not be considered more difficult than that of the children in our Eng- 
lish schdols who pass the fifth standard and have taken up one or more of the special. 
subjects. t 
~The only other excuses allowed are: (a) One applicable to half-time scholars, viz, 
_ that a school board may, subject to the consent of the departmental council, exempt 
children employed in trades or agriculture from one of the two daily attendances—so 
_ “that children can only be employed as half-timers in trades or agriculture, under 
} the age of thirteen, by the joint consent of the communes and of the department, un- , 
_ less at or above the age of eleven they have obtained the ‘certificat d’études;’” (6) 
‘illness of the child; (c) death of a member of the family ; or (d) hindrances resulting 
- from accidental difficulty of‘access to the school. And all other excuses will have to 
ee be judged by the scholastic commission, a body constituted for the purpose of enfore- 
s ing regular school attendance, : 
Owing probably, however, not only to the public desire for education in France, 
but to the strict supervision exercised by the authorities, and the punishments im- 
posable in case of irregularity in attendance, the school attendance is excellent, espe- 
cially in cities; and it is computed “‘ that 10 per cent. is the maximum absence for any 
 school‘in Paris, while in a very large number of schools the total average of attend- 
ance exceeds 95 per cent. 
- Children are protected by law against premature employment, but the law doesnot 
seem to be, in some of the departments, officially carried out. Proper books record- 
- ing the attendance at both public and private schools have to be kept, and absences: 
"reported, and even private head-masters neglecting to do this are liable to be repri- 
“manded or suspended. 
School age.—There is. no definition of school age, or any law respecting it, 
except that relating to compulsory attendance. The ‘“ écoles maternelles” admit 
children from two years of age, and from M. Ferry’s report on the organization of 
superior primary schools, coupled with the facilities provided by the state for the 
promotion of adult education, it is evident that it is against the policy of France to y 
impose any limit of age. 
Infant schools,—The infant class, or the maternal school, is the initial, although 
_ not, as applying to any under school age (six), a compulsory stage. Of infant schools 
- or classes, the following points seem worth consideration: (a) The object of and 
/ method adopted in them, including the adoption in great part of the method of 
_ Froebel; (b) the addition of an infant class to a primary school when a separate 
- school is impracticable; (c) the limitation of numpers for each teacher ; and (d) the 
: fact that infant schools are not only taught exclusively by females (who must be, 1 
  
1This is an error; twelve is the maximum in the primary school.—[Ep,

i ; ; 
however, of a certain age, and qualified), but also inspected by ‘‘départmental lady 
inspectors,” and ‘‘ general lady inspectors,” nominated by the minister. It should, 
however, be added that the appointments of departmental lady inspectors are not 
yet regularly and generally established, by reason of the expense; although it is 
hoped that it will be possible to perfect the organization in a few years. Private in- 
fant schools are subject to supervision similarly to other private schools, 
Elementary primary schools—The next grade is the primary school proper, 
where instruction is always understood to be, whatever may be the number of pupils 
and classes, divided into three courses of two years each—(a) Elementary, from six 
to eight years of age; (b) Intermediate, from éight to ten, and superior, from ten to 
twelve. An additional course of one, two, or three years is provided under certain 
circumstances; but this course, although annexed to the elementary schools, is 
ranked in the category of superior primary education. 
In all the above-mentioned courses industrial work, or, at all events, what may be 
deemed to be practical preparation for it, isin the programmes both for boys and 
girls; and, indeed, inmany primary schools, including a considerable number of those 
in Paria, instruction is given in handicrafts. 
The ordinary number of pupils in an elementary primary school, at least in Paris, 
is from 300 to 400; and the average size of the classes ranges from 40 to 50 pupils, and 
must not exceed 50. 4 
In every primary school there is a hall, where there are lavatories and movable 
tables whereon the children can take at noon their dinner meal, and near to there are 
culinary arrangements for preparing or warming up the children’s food. Where. 
there is nota special hall for the teaching of gymnastics, the children can march or 
perform gymnastic exercises\in the dining hall, or bave recreation there in rainy 
weather; and in such a case a part of it will be devoted for the deposit of the 
children’s clothing. The playgrounds are, as a rule, small; although they are con- 
sidered indispensable for a primary school. 
Both Mr. Matthew Arnold and a prominent member of the London school board Seay 
consider that the French elementary schools are in advance of the English ; and the 
commissioners state that the ordinary schools of France (primary and secondary) 
excel the English ones as a preparation for the technical school. 
Superior primary schools.—The next step isthe superior primary school, an insti- GERMAN, AMERICAN, AND FRENCH SCHOOLS COMPARED. 47 
tution entirely distinct from the elementary primary school; and here the course com- ~ 
' prises at least two years of studies, and here also manual instruction is pursued ; al- 
though there are also schools established mainly for apprenticeship instruction pur- 
poses, superior primary schools include also higher elementary technical schools, 
The object of the establishment of superior primary schools is found stated in the 
report of October 29, 1881;'and their organization in a letter from M. Ferry to the © 
prefect, dated November 6, 1881. There are no optional subjects. Special masters 
attend to teach music, gymnastics, and sometimes drawing, which is said to be more 
advanced than in English schools. The ordinary school hours are from 8 a. m. to 4 
p. m., one hour and and a half interval at noon, and one hour 4 t05 p.m. for 
gymnastics. The income available for expenditure on primary schools is derived 
mainly from the state and the communes. The state supremely controls, in the case . 
of aJl primary schools, through the minister of public instruction. 
Secondary and higher schools.—(1) Substantial public money aid is given by grants 
and in scholarships, which latter are provided for colleges, lyceums, and faculties, as 
well as for superior primary schools, and the aid is contributed respectively by the 
state, the departments, and the communes, and is very munificent. (2) Instruction 
in secondary schools is not gratuitous, but the fees payable by scholars are very much 
Jess than in similar establishments in England, owing not only to the grants, but to 
the low salaries paid to professors and teachers of all grades in France. (3) Thead- | 
mission of young children into the lower divisions of both the communal colleges and 
lyceums for special elementary preparation is worthy of note, and also (4) the fact 
         
-P-A-G-E-114
              
v 8. : EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. Ae i 
that modern languages and science have been largely substituted in the secondary 
chools for Latin and Greek. 
Technical instruction.—No pains are spared, especially to develop the mane genius 
f the artisan classes. This is done not only by the blending of industrial theory and 
’ practice into the primary school course of study, and by evening schools, Sunday, ap- 
prentice, and continuation schools and classes, but by science and art schools for 
adults and others, and by lectures of all kinds; all which instruction is gratuitous, 
except in some cases a nominal fee for admission to lectures. The evening instruc- 
tion is considered the most striking feature of the present condition of educational 
effort in France. 
. Physical training —Physical training’ occupies a prominent position in the school 
programmes. It is provided that even the infant schools and classes shall be exer- 
cised in gymnastics, graduated to favor the physical development of the child, whilst 
‘in reciting in the regulations of primary schools the triple object of education, phys- 
ical education is placed before either of the two other objects, and it is provided that 
in addition to evolutions and exercises which can accompany the movements of the 
class, gymnastic exercises are to be had every day, or at least every two days, in the 
course of the afternoon. In the communal colleges and lyceums the exercises occupy 
_ four lessons per week of half an hour’s duration each, 
| Private schools.—Private schools are not under general state control, yet they are 
subject to state, supervision in respect to (a) morality, (b) sanitary arrangements, 
(ce) the keeping a register of and reporting absences, and (d) so that the books used 
be not such as are contrary to the actual constitution or principles of the govern- 
ment. i 
\ Teachers.—The “brevet de capacité ” requirement of the law of June 16, 1881, and 
the further provisions of the law passed in 1886, render the proper qualification of 
teachers indispensable. The subject of normal schools therefore has become, not 
mly to the state but to the teacher, an especially important one; and in all the de- 
partments there are excellent state normal schools for the training of masters and in 
nany for mistresses. Examinations are held foradmission. Pupils enter at eighteen, 
The course of study is for three years. A primary school, in which pupils are exer- 
ised, is annexed to each normal school, and near outside is a maternal school. ‘The 
institutions are boarding schools, although acertain number of half boarders and 
t day scholars are received; but instruction and board are given gratuitously, There 
2 is no religious teaching. 
_ There-are also two superior normal schools, one at Fontenay-aux-Roses for. girls, 
and one at St. Cloud for boys, for the purpose of training teachers to superintend 
teaching in normal schools. Applicants for admission must be at least twenty years of 
age, possess the superior certificate granted to teachers, and succeed in an admission 
examination which comprehends written and oral proofs of capacity, including the 
practice of teaching. Both classes of establishments are national institutions, non- 
ecclesiastical and mainly residential in character. ¢* 
5 Teachers for primary schools must be exclusively laymen, and are ‘nominated on 
the proposition of the inspector by the prefect of the department (province). The 
inspector, however, ‘‘ always acts in concert with and takes the opinion of the rural 
municipality before naming the teacher.” 
The pupil-teacher system is virtually -defenct in France, thé former system of 
1onitors which somewhat corresponded to the English pupil-teacher arrangements 
having become substantially a thing of the past. Women are much more fully em- 
ployed as teachers than in Germany and Switzerland. 
Professors and teachers of all grades are very poorly paid; and if Vietor Hugo’s 
definition be correct, that the schoolmaster in France is the highest functionary of 
the state, they certainly do not pay their highest state functionaries adequately. 
Every teacher has a right tu a pension after twenty-five years’ service. It is caleu- 
lated at the rate of one-half of the highest salary earned during the last six years

of office. Toward the pension fund, deductions are made from salaries, Gratuities 
are given. 
Inspection.—The inspection is excellent, although there is no special feature, except 
that of lady inspectors for infant schools, All inspectors, chief, departmental, and 
primary, are nominated by the minister, and are recruited * * * from amongst 
the masters of elemontary schools. Each department (province) of the country has 
a departmental inspector, and as many primary ones as there are divisions or dis- 
tricts. The inspectors’ salaries, compared with those of the teachers, aro high. The 
National Educational Association of France agreed that regular medical inspection 
should be made in every school to avoid epidemic or contagious diseases and injury 
to eyesight. 
Medical inspectors are now employed in large cities. 
IX.—SUMMARY OF COMPARATIVE STATISTICS. 
Before entering into the minutie of the work performed in the : 
schools of Prussia and France, it seems well to review the statistics 
found on previous pages. : 
For every one hundred inhabitants in 1886-87 there were in public 
schools between kindergarten and university :

X.—OTHER POINTS OF COMPARISON. 
Allthe Prussian schools mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs are 
public, excepting a few in the second group (see Diagram II); that is, 
they are open to the poorer children, provided the means are furnished 
them, but in that case special talents must entitle them to the opportu- 
nity of associating with aristocracy and plutocracy. The public schools 
as such are obnoxious to certain exclusive circles, hence they maintain 
private schools to which none but their own children are admitted. 
These exclusive institutions are omitted from the foregoing diagram, 
ED 8)——4 
 
-P-A-G-E-116
      50 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
since the comparison is to be between the American common school 
and such institutions in Germany as are similar in scope and aims. 
Tuition in the American common school is free for all children of 
legal school age. Some States even fix the minimum at four years, 
while others fix the maximum at sixteen and eighteen years. In 
Germany, or, to keep within the boundary of comparison, in Prussia, 
free tuition is granted only to the indigent stratum of society. Though 
it is the ultimate aim of both the legislative and executive branches of 
the government to make tuition, at least in the people’s schools, free of 
charge, as yet it has remained a pious wish. Only in rare cases, in the 
capital Berlin, for instance, the city government has carried this into 
effect throughout the city’s school system. 
It is a well-known fact and everywhere admitted that each class of 
schools in Germany is eminently successful within the limits of its scope; 
it must be stated, however, that the several classes are not in organic 
connection with each other, chiefly owing to the different, and even con- 
flicting, demands made upon them by their patrons and the Govern- 
ment. The courses of study in schools of one and the same class fre- 
quently differ materially. If a pupil of a Prussian people’s school 
applies for admission to a middle or high school, he may be set back 
two, three, and four years, as the case may be, because he lacks knowl- 
edge of foreign or classic languages. This is merely an illustration of 
the heterogeneous nature of the various classes of schools, 
Here in America, without national school supervision or legislation, 
the courses of study of forthe schools thousands of miles apart are so   nearly alike that a pupil of the eighth-year grade of a Philadelphia city 
school may be safely admitted into the same grade of a San Francisco 
city school without danger of unduly retarding or promoting him. Or, 
a pupil who has gone through the lower schools in a small town of the 
West may apply for admission to almost any public high school in the 
land; he is reasonably sure of finding himself on a level with the re- 
quirements of admission. - 
Though we classify our grades into primary, grammar (or intermediate), 
and high schools, there is no essential difference between them in treat- | 
ment of either object or subject. But in Germany, as will be shown 
later on, there is not only no uniformity, but even antagonism between 
the different classes of schools. It is easy to see that while this may 
be a fruitful source of competition, it is not conducive to harmony, and 
tends to retard the nationalizing of the schools of Germany. 
- XL—Distincrive FEATURES OF THE COURSES OF STUDY IN PRUS-’ 
_ SIAN SCHOOLS. 
Before the readeris made acquainted with the minutia of the different 
courses of study in graphic presentation, a few statements concerning 
the characteristics of the three groups of Prussian schools may precede 
a comparison with the schools in this country.

GERMAN, AMERICAN, AND FRENCH SCHOOLS COMPARED. 51 
(1) The people’s school in Prussia varies but little from that of other 
German States in aims, though it does in organization. Here and there 
. slight differences are noticed owing to local predilections and influences, 
- This school has an eight years’ course in cities, a seven years’ course in ru- 
ral districts. Children of both sexes are taught together till they reach 
the eleventh or twelfth year ofage; then, if local circumstances allow it, 
they are taught in separate classes. When they are “released” from 
school they are “confirmed” in the Protestant Church, or go to “ first 
communion” in the Catholic Church. 
No language but the mother tongue is taught (except in the schools of 
afew border provinces), and this without the aid of a text-book in 
grammar. From the lowest grade upward careful training in the use 
of the language without evolving or applying many rules is the object. 
Arithmetic is not carried on quite so far as is done in this country, and 
not quite one-half the time spent here is used for arithmetic in Prussia. 
(For reasons see p. 56.) History is taught quite early, beginning with 
“home stories;” Prussian and German history both necessitate more 
than mere glances at general history. All history in this school is of- 
fered in biographies. Geography is taught within a limited compass, 
topographical and political as well as mathematical and physical. Nat- 
ural history is taught in form of object lessons. Only in the highest or 
sometimes in the two highest grades do physics and physiology come 
in for much attention. Drawing, singing, and gymnastics are all taught 
to a greater extent than is done in the average American school. No 
text-books are used for history, natural history, physics, ete.; all these 
studies are oral, but are not regarded as mere ornaments. In the read- 
ers the pupils find much solid reading; these books contain master- 
pieces of all kinds of prose and poetry, instructive and amusing. Oom- 
posing in words and pictures goes on at every step, and is developed to 
a very astonishing degree. 
(2) The middle schools. (a) Buerger, or citizens’ schools, so called, in 
contradistinction to the. people’s schools (for many centuries the citi- 
zens were considered a higher stratum of society than the people, 
although the word buerger meant originally the denizen of a burg or 
fortified place), attempt more than the mere elements. Their pupils as 
a rule come from more cultured families, and speak German with little 
of the ruling dialect, hence need not spend so much time in learning to 
use their mother tongue correctly. One or two foreign languages are 
taught, and the customary scientific branches and mathematics have a 
wider scope than in the people’s schools. Drawing leans toward indus- 
trial pursuits. Side by side with these boys’ schools are the (b) Hiéhere 
Médchen-Schulen, or giris’ academies, which in their academic studies 
go parallel with the citizens’ boys schools, but terminate in a post-grad- 
uate course for the preparation of young teachers. Both these middle 
schools resemble in their upper grades our common high schools. It 
may be said that this class of schools offers an education moré advanced

| 
than can be given in people’s schools, and less extended than a prepa- 
ration for the university requires. There is more diversity in aims and 
methods in these middle schools than in 
(3) The high schools: (a) Realschule, (b) Gymnasium, (ce) Realgymna- 
sium. This array of technical/terms is difficult to renderin English.. A 
verbal translation would be misleading and a labored cireumlocution 
useless. The Gymnasium is the oldest. It is the classical boys’ school 
par excellence; the Realschule (the first one was founded one hundred 
and forty years ago) substitutes modern languages for the classics, and 
gives much attention to natural sciences, mathematics, and industrial 
drawing and designing. The Gymnasium prepares for the learned pro- 
fessions, the Realschule trains engineers, surveyors, artists, civil officers, 
etc. The Realgymnasium is a combination of the two kinds of schools. 
From the accompanying charts the differences existing between these 
_ schools may be gleaned better than from verbal explanations. The great 
army of business men recruits itself from these higher schools and from 
the middle schools, The boy of the people’s school has a hard time of 
it in courting success in higher walks of life; still, such cases are not 
unknown. What givesto the Prussian secondary schools such a remark- 
able impetus is the fact that their graduates and undergraduates are 
called upon to serve in the army only one year, while all other able-bodied 
men must serve three years. 
XIIL—REMARKS EXPLANATORY TO THE ACCOMPANYING CHARTS. 
On Chart I it will be seen that the course sketched for the American 
common school is an average course, such as is found with slight devia- 
tions all over this country. It does not show distinctions made here 3 
and there, or preferences in favor of this, that, or the other language, and 
leaves the limit of time spent in the study of grammar undefined, but 
shows that much time is consumed in mastering the orthography of the 
_ Englishlanguage. Itis scarcely necessary for the reader in this country 
to see the average course of study minutely delineated. Of course, if a 
selection were made here and in Europe among the schools we might 
present a picture which would make a just comparison quite impossible. 
Statistics is the science of averages, and it is the average school, not 
the exception, which is here delineated. 
The courses of the Prussian schools are endeavors, also, to present 
en bloc the leading features of language instruction. A carefal com- 
parison between those of Realschule and Gymnasium, for instance, will 
reveal the vital difference between them. These charts are the result 
of the comparison of many courses of study in use published in annual 
reports of German schools and filed in this Bureau; also of the require- 
ments made by the Prussian Government, notably by the decree of 
May 31, 1882.

Prussian schools. Chart IIL shows that in the high schools of Prussia 
mathematics begins with geometry in the form of arithmetical mensura- 
tion, or, as some haveit, geometry in object lessons. The comparison with 
an average American high school is particularly instructive. 
sequent chapter it will be shown why in Europe, with the exception of 
England, the study of arithmetic is more satisfactory than here. 
Chart IV is somewhat misleading, because it would seem from it 
that there is no difference in the time given to the natural sciences in 
the high schools in Prussia, but in fact the time, that is the number of 
hours per week, devoted to those studies differs materially in the different 
schools, as. may best be seen from the four time-tables accompanying 
this, and also from the typical courses of study. (See subsequent chap- 
ters.) Ina sub- 
A graphic presentation of the time devoted to music, drawing, pen- 
manship, and gymnastics has not been attempted, for reasons too obvi- 
ous to be mentioned; but the following time-tables will shed some light

Norr.—Attention is directed to the total number of hours devoted in French Lycées and in Prossian high schools. If the five to six hours devoted to religion, music, and gymnastics in Prussia be added to the table of French Lycées the total number of hours spent in school would still be about five hours 
Jess than in Prassia. 
XV.—CAUSES OF RAPID ADVANCEMENT IN STUDIES. 
A cursory review of the foregoing charts and time tables will con- 
vince even the most skeptical, that the advancement made in Prussia in 
the studies of the curriculum is a good deal faster than in America. 
Several leading college professors and other noted teachers of this coun- 
try, who have made the European schools a subject of study, claim that 
the average time gained in German schools as compared with Ameri- 
canis about three years. That difference ought to be accounted for, and 
it iseasilydone. The causes may be enumerated as being (a) the diffi- 
cult spelling of the English language; (b) the efforts made in learning 
and applying the tables of our arbitrary measures and weights; (c) the 
length of the school year; (d) the want of a profession of teachers in 
this country, and lack of proper teaching. . Theseare not the only causes; 
there are others of minor importance which might give rise to interesting 
discussions, but the scope of this work forbids entering into them. 
Spelling.—The orthography of the English language is most difficult 
tolearn. It is very unruly and arbitrary. The want of rules under 
which words might be grouped makes the acquirement of correct spell- 
inga case of mere mechanical memory. An hour per day scarcely suf- 
fices to make the average child master of the art of writing correctly 
without constant reference tothe dictionary. Spelling,as adaily study, 
runs through the entire course, and even the graduates of the high 
school still need constant drill in orthography to keep up a certain stand- 
ard of perfection. The amount of time a child spends in learning the 
orthography of the English language is out of all proportion to that 
given to other studies, though it is necessary; and theenergy wasted 
in acquiring something which does not aid the child intellectually is 
deplorable. If by general consent of Congress, press, and school, the 
English orthography were simplified to the degree it has been done in
-P-A-G-E-126
60 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
‘Germany it would be a saving of an entire year to every school child in 
this country. From Chart I (see p. 53) it may ‘be seen how compara- 
tively little time is spent in German schools in the study of orthog- 
raphy, and that it reaches a degree of perfection which is never ex- 
pected or even hoped for in English or American schools. The time 
saved in this study is in Germany devoted to history and literature. 
Metric system.—Our school children generally spend an entire year in 
trying to learn and apply tables of measures and weights in arithmetic. 
The chapter of denominate numbers claims a very large portion of space 
in our text-books in arithmetic, and its study, like that of orthography, 
consumes much valuable time that might be profitably employed in nat- 
ural history and elementary natural science. The child in continental 
European schools (we must except England, which still clings to the 
arbitrary measures) has no tables toremember, for he learns the divisions 
of the metric system, together with notation and enumeration of numbers, 
during thefirsttwo years in school. As soon ashe can enumerate and 
notate between one and one thousand he can measure and weigh accord- 
ing to the metricsystem. There are only six names of divisions to be re- 
membered: kilo, hecto, deka, and deci, centi, milli, and four measures: 
metre for distance, are for areas, liter for fluids, and gramme for weights. 
These ten technical terms are all that are required. If we think of our 
yard, acre, gallon, bushel, and different pounds, etc., with all their various 
divisions, and then consider that each of these measures has a different 
number of divisions, it does not seem improbable that nearly a year’s 
hard study might be removed by adopting the metric system. As our 
English orthography is a mechanical cause of 1etarding the children’s 
progress, so are our arbitrary measures. That our pupils are not ad- 
vanced in their studies as fast as can be done, and is done in Europe, 
is in a great measure due to these mechanical causess 
The element of time—The length of the school year in Prussia (and 
possibly in France) is almost uniformly 10$ months or about 250 school 
days (exclusive of holidays and vacations), while in the United States 
it varies between 60 and 196 days, with an average of 135 days. This 
obvious difference alone puts the American school at a disadvantage, 
but this is notall. It is not only that in Germany the number of school 
days is greater, but that the school day is considerably longer than in 
the United States. It is a simple example of multiplication, to wit: 
With us a school day is, at various places and during different sea- 
sons, from 5 to 5$ hours long, which amounts to 980 to 1,078 hours a year. 
The German child, on the other hand, has 4 days of 6 to 64 hours each 
and 2 days of 4 hours each in every week of the school year. This 
amounts to from 1,323 to 1,406 hours in a year. Or to take average 
numbers: In the United States the child is under the influence of school 
during 1,029 hours a year; the German child is under that influence 
1,364 hours, or about one-third more than the American child. 
In the foregoing comparison it should be borne in mind that the reli- 
 
-P-A-G-E-127
  GERMAN, AMERICAN, AND FRENCH SCHOOLS COMPARED. Gk 
gious instruction in German schools commonly consumes from 40 to 60. 
minutes a day. Hence, leaving this out of consideration, the time re- 
maining for the common branches is about the same in Germany as in 
the United States, though it must be considered that the religious in- 
struction is to a great extent aiding the language work of the school, 
also the work in history ‘by means of biblical biographies. Besides, 
German teachers claim that it aids the teacher in maintaining dis- 
cipline. All this may have some weight when the element of time is 
considered. 
Now this element is not mentioned to show that the schools in this 
country might be kept open longer, for the time (5 to 54 hours) is, ac 
cording to the unanimous verdict of all who have observed minutely, 
the maximum of time children can stand continuous mental exertion 
under the climatic influences of this country. The temperament of 
German children and the climate in Germany permit longer school ses- 
sions. The fact is stated merely as a fact which may not be without 
weight, when the excellent results of average German schools are con- 
sidered. 
Teaching is a profession —In Prussia the stability of the teacher’s 
position is a factor which we must consider in our comparison. A 
person in Prussia, and for that matter everywhere in Germany, must 
acquire professional training before he is eligible to a position as teacher. 
This is offered free of charge in every State of Germany. After he has 
completed his course in the normal schoo! and in the training depart- 
ment he is elected by acommunity, but must serve a probationary term 
of two years. Whether during this time he is a suecess or not, at the close 
of the second year he is obliged to present himself to the State (or pro- 
vincial) board of examiners, consisting of the faculty of the nearest nor- 
mal school presided over by a privy school councilor, to pass his “review 
examination.” This examination lasts several days, during which the 
academic and professional studies are gone over, and model lessons are 
_ given without previous special preparation. If the teacher proves that 
during the two years he has made commendabie pregress in the science 
and art of teaching, he is granted a diploma for life. Henceforth he is 
free from all further examinations and can settle down permanently, 
since his position is not endangered by “political rotation” or other 
causes except his own errors, such as gross neglect of duty, etc. Besides, 
he receives a pension after a certain number of years of service. 
The fact that there are no persons teaching in Germany who have 
not had a three years’ professional preparation in academic studies and 
in the science of teaching, in psychology and the history of education, 
as well asin the practice of teaching, is perhaps the most important 
factor of the notable success in German schools,.and the rapid advance- 
ment of the pupils. Concerning the professional preparation of teach- 
ers in this country, the state of affairsis so well known that it need not 
be stated,  
-P-A-G-E-128
  62 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
All the causes mentioned above, and other's of less influence, com-. 
bine in accounting for the excellent results witnessed in German schools. 
Some of these causes are at work in France also, and will unquestion- 
ably have the same beneficial result eventually. Germany, it may be 
asserted, has an educational atmosphere. This is noticeable from such 
facts as these: 
All schools, lower, middle, and higher, stand in close connection with and inti- 
mate relation to the management of art academies, arf museums, zodlogical and bo- 
tanical gardens, the observatory, the libraries, the gymnastic societies, and even the 
theaters; in fact, with every institution which in some degree may be influential in 
assisting the work in school. 
Plants are ordered for the study of botany at the botanical gardens, Certain hours 
are fixed at the zodlogical gardens for visits of the classes in zodlogy ; admission free. 
Classes in drawing are taken to the art collections and museums, where the teacher 
of advanced classes gives a lesson monthly. The libraries are open to pupils on pre- 
sentation of a membership ticket issued by the rector of theschool. Classes in litera- 
ture go with their teachers to see classic performances in the theater, The schools 
having small but valuable collections for the study of natural history, frequently ex- 
change specimens with the curator of the museum, or even make,loans. Churches 
have their reserved seats for school children ; gardens and parks are open to them; 
play-grounds are provided with flower-beds for children, etc. To every department 
of the curriculum some institution outside of school offers assistance free of charge.

XX.—AN AMERICAN OPINION ON THE VITAL DIFFERENCES BE- 
TWEEN GERMAN AND AMERICAN SCHOOLS. f 
In ‘answer to the question, What is the vital difference between a 
first-class German school and an American school of the same standing ? 
the editor of the Popular Educator (Boston) makes these pointed — 
remarks : 
Generally speaking, we should say that the difference between the two schools is 
that which one would expect when the temperaments and the governments of the 
two peoples are compared. The German boy is quiet—duli he sometimes seems to be 
to the American eye, and he is trained by the laws and customs of his country to 
strict obedience. The German boy, therefore, knows more of books, has greater 
ability of mental concentration than the American boy at the samo age. - The teacher, 
too, because of these traits, is not obliged to ba so apt in governing as the American 
teacher; and so,if not always so brilliant as our best teachers, he is broader and 
more thorough. But the German teacher dislikes the American boy. And thisis 
evidence, given the boy and the teacher (and the fact that adaptability of the one to 
the other is essential to successful teaching), that the difference between the German 
teacher and the American is one of kind rather than quality. 
The German school differs from the American school more in its curriculum of work 
than in anything else. Germany has taken care that the schools shall not only be 
filled by competent teachers, but that these instructors shal! be supervised and as- 
sisted by equally competent educators. There are no politicsin the German schools, 
From end to. end of the Empire reaches the oversight of the minister of instruction. 
Teachers are selected with great care, are officers of the state, and retired at the 
proper time on a pension, With us there is no system. Committees come and go, 
and so do the officers they elect. The result is, that, while our first-rate schools are, 
so far as the teachers are concerned, quite as good as those of Germany, nowhere 
will there be found the same care and thought in adapting the work to be done to the 
growth of the child, in supplying the school rooms with the necessary apparatus and 
material for work, and the consequent all-round development of the child. There 
may be a compensation for our defects in these particulars—defects which we shall 
have to attribute to our democratic institutions. ©

 XXIL—FRENCH STUDENTS IN GERMAN HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The superiority of German public schools over those of other nations 
has been acknowledged repeatedly, but it has of late been recognized 
by the French school officials in a manner which is both unique and 
acceptable. In “European Schools” an account is given under the 
above heading which may be quoted here as circumstantial evidence of 
the superiority of German schools: 
It is now nearly twelve years since the French national school authorities resolved 
upon @ direct acknowledgment of that superiority by sending annually several 
graduates of French lyeées to attend the last two years of the course in German high 
schools. No indifferent material is sent, to be sure, but only boys who have won the 
first prizes. As it is stated elsewhere (see also page 36 of this report), the German 
secondary schools are well adapted to talented pupils, while weaker ones are weeded 
out. These French boys, then, coming as they do like “picked nines,” are not ob- 
jeeted to by German school authorities. They say there is no reason whatever to 
refuse them admittance, inasmuch as they conduct themselves properly, and usually 
are a credit to the schools they attend. 
These boys are directed to stay a half year or a year at ‘one school and then go to 
another. They are not allowed to stay two full years in one town, lest they might 
enter into ties too close to suit the French Government. They are directed to take 
board and lodging in private families and to live exactly as the pupils of German 
gymnasiums do. The Government pays all expenses during their stay in Germany. 
At the close of each year the students are required to send in a report of what they 
_ experienced and the manner in which they utilized their time. Of course the fre- 
. quent changes of schools and place of habitation are inconvenient, but they enable 
the young men to see a good deal of the country. 
_ The author says further : 
Thad opportunities to learn something of the contents of the report sent home to 
the minister of instruction, and must confess that they are mostly true to life and 
tally with my own observations. Most of the young men are very much pleased with 
the reception they find among the people, the teachers, and the pupils. * * * All, 
however, are loud in praising the instruction they get in school. 
They are unanimous in saying that the German high schools are superior to the 
French lycées. Especially in mathematics, they think, the German schools prove 
superior. The way the students are made to work out problems in geometry, trigo- 
nometry, oral arithmetic, etc., the self-activity to which the pupils are led, and the 
independence and self-dependence in thinking, are commended. Instruction in the 
sciences also is thought superior to that in France. Particularly enthusiastic are 
the reports about gymnastic drill. This ig not astonishing if we ‘consider that the 
indulged French youth is not drilled much at home in bodily exercises. An equal 
share of praise is given to the teaching of music. In referring to this the young 
Frenchmen. speak with animation of the German songs which they consider very 
melodious. ' 
As far as instruction is concerned they have but one opinion ; but they do not like 
the rigid discipline exercised in German high schools. The slightest deviation from 
the straight road of virtue is punished severely. They are “not treated as gentle- 
men,” but ‘‘as boys, ” are obliged to doff their hats when they pass a teacher, and 
are generally treated as unripe youths. In another particular the German high

schools find condemnation on the part of these French students. They say Germans . 
' pay less attention to show—that is, to legitimate show. For instance, they care 
naught for rhetorical polish, and their recitations are considered good when the 
essential facts are brought out correctly. The garment of thought is neglected. 
Their teaching of drawing is also less refined than that in France,

XXIL—AN ENGLISHMAN’S VIEW or THE GERMAN SCHOOLS. 
Mr. Samuel Smith, M. P. » Wrote i in takch 1888, to the London Times 
as follows: 
“The salient fact which strikes all observers is the universality of 
good education in that country. There is no such thing as an unedu- 
cated class; there are no such things, speaking broadly, as neglected 
and uncared-for children. All classes of the community are better edu- 
cated than the corresponding ones in our country; and this applies . 
quite as much to primary as to secondary education. Nothing struck 
me more than the general intelligence of the humbler working classes. 
Waiters, porters, guides, and others have a knowledge of history, geog- 
raphy, and other subjects far beyond that possessed by corresponding 
classes in England, and the reason is not far to seek. The whole popu- 
lation has long been passed through a thorough and comprehensive 
system of instruction obligatory by law, and far more extended than is 
given in our elementary schools. I went through several of these 
schools and observed the method of teaching, which was simply admi- 
rable. The children are not crammed, but are taught to reason from the 
earliest stages. The first object of the teacher is to make his pupils 
comprehend the meaning of everything they learn, and to carry them ~ 
from stage to stage, so as to keep up an eager interest. 
“TI saw no signs of weariness or apathy among either teachers or 
scholars. The teaching was all viva voce, the teacher always standing 
beside the blackboard and illustrating his subject by object lessons. 
The instruction was through the eye and hand as well as the ear, and 
question and answer succeeded so sharply as to keep the whole class 
on the qui vive. The teachers are, as a body, much better trained than 
in England, and seem to be enthusiasts in their calling, and the school 
holds a far higher position in the social economy of the country than it 
does with us. What I am saying here applies equally to Switzerland — 
as to Germany, and, for educational purposes, Zurich will compare with 
any part of the German Empire. The main advantage, however, that 
primary education has in Germany over England lies in the regularity 
of attendance and the longer period of school life. There is none of the 
difficulty of getting children to school that exists in England; the laws 
are very rigid and permit no frivolous excuses, and, what is even more 
important, the people entirely acquiesce in the laws, and are inclined 
.

rather to increase than relax their rigor. “It is well known that in Lon- 
‘don and all our great cities a large part of the population seek to avoid 
school attendance by every means in their power, and consequently the 
‘attendance is most irregular. There is very little of this in Germany; 
atleast I have not found it so. Then, in our country, a great portion 
of our children are withdrawn altogether from school after passing the 
fourth or fifth standard, at the age of eleven or twelve, whereas in 
Germany almost everywhere attendance is compulsory until fourteen 
for boys, though in some places girls are allowed to leave at thirteen. 
“This last point is the one I wish to emphasize. The great defect— 
Imight almost call it the fatal defect—of our system is that it stops just 
at a time when real education should begin. It allows a child to leave 
school at an age when its learning is soon forgotten and its discipline 
effaced. It is hardly too much to say that the two years’ additional 
training the German child receives in the elementary school doubles its 
chance in life as compared with the English child. 
“But this is not all. The Germans are rapidly developing a system 
of evening continuation classes, which carry on education for two or 
‘three years longer. In Saxony the boys who leave the primary school, 
if they do not go to the higher schools, must attend for three years 
longer—say until they are seventeen—continuation classes for at least 
five hours per week. But teaching is provided for them, and they are 
encouraged to attend twelve hours per week. So complete is this sys- 
tem that even the waiters at the hotels up to the age of seventeen at- 
. tend afternoon classes, and are taught one or two foreign languages. 
I take Saxony as one of the most advanced States; but the law is much 
the same in Wiirttemberg and Baden, and the system is found to work 
go well that it is in comtemplation to extend it to all the States in the 
  German Empire, and Austria will probably follow suit. This is confi- 
dently expected to happen in the course of 1888, I must state as an 
undoubted fact that in Germany and Switzerland, and I believe in some 
other continental countries, the opinion is ripening into a conviction 
- that the education even of the poorest classes should be continued in 
some form or other to the age of sixteen or seventeen. They find by 
experience that wherever this is adopted it gives an enormous advan- 
tage to the people in the competition of life, and above all, trains them 
to habits of industry and mental application. I believe that it is owing 
to this system of thorough education that Germany has almost. extin- 
guished the pauper and semipauper class, which is the bane and dis- 
grace of our country. 
«“ Wherever I haye gone I have inquired how they deal with the rag- 
ged and squalid class of children, and I have been told in every city I 
visited—Ziirich, Stuttgart, Nuremberg, Chemnitz, Dresden, and Ber- 
lin—that such a class practically does not exist. Ido not mean that 
‘there is not poverty, and plenty of it, in Germany. Wages are much 
lower than in England, and many havea hard struggle to live; but

there does not seem to exist to any extent that mass of sunken, degraded 
beings who with us cast their children apon the streets, or throw them 
on the rates, or leave them to charity. Some half a million children in 
' the United Kingdom are dependent more or less on the alms or the 
rates of the community, and probably another half-million are miser- 
ably underfed and underclad. Nothing to correspond with this exists. 
in Germany. The poorest people there would be ashamed to treat their 
children as multitudes do with us. Indeed, I have not seen since I left 
home a single case of a ragged or begging child. I repeat that the 
great cause of this both in Germany and Switzerland is the far greater 
care they have taken of the education of the children for at least two or 
three generations, whereas we have only taken the matter up seriously 
since 1870, when Mr. Foster's great act was passed. 
“Let us contrast the general condition of our London children, for 
instance, at the age of fifteen or sixteen with that of the same class 
in Berlin, or Dresden, or Chemnitz. With us nine-tenths of the chil- 
dren have long since left school, and a too large proportion of them are 
receiving no training but the coarse and brutalizing education of the 
streets. Most of them retain little of what they have learned at school, . 
except the power to read the ‘ penny dreadful,’ which stuffs their minds 
with everything a child should not know. They are to a very large ex- 
tent adepts in profane and obscene language and are frequenters of the 
public house and similar places; a great many of them are learning 
no useful trade or calling, but are drifting helplessly into the class of 
wretched, ill-paid, casual laborers. Very many of them marry before 
they are twenty and are soon the parents of a numerous progeny, half 
starved and stunted, both in body and mind. Compare, or rather.con- 
trast, this with Germany. At fifteen or sixteen a great part of the 
children are still under excellent instruction. Exceedingly few are to 
be found roaming about the streets. They are prohibited, at least in 
some parts of Germany, from entering the public houses (except with 
their parents) until the age of seventeen, and I am told are every where 
prohibited from smoking until sixteen. In fact there are, both by law 
and public sentiment, barriers placed against the corraption of the 
young which do not exist in England. 
“No country has ever suffered more from the abuse of the idea of 
individual liberty than England has done, Ovwing to this overstrained 
idea we did not get compulsory education until long after the advanced 
nations of the Continent, and still we are far behind them in the care 
we take of our children. Itis intolerable that this state of things should 
continue longer. Democratic government everywhere insists upon good. 
education, and expects each citizen to fulfill his duties to the state. 
“ Public opinion in our country will certainly insist, and that before 
long, that we shall not be forever disgraced with the residuum of 
drunken, demoralized, and utterly incapable population to be found in® 
any modern state. It will insist that some time be spared for the solu-

  EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89, 
tion of this vital-question from the wrangles of party politics and the 
personal recriminations of party leaders. When one sees what a poor 
country like Germany has dene to raise its people in spite of the con- 
scription and three years’ compulsory military service, in spite of fre- — 
quent and exhausting wars, from which our island home has been free, 
_ one has grave doubts whether our system of party government is not a 
failure. : ; 
“ Oertainly we waste on barren conflicts and wordy strife far more 
time than other nations do in the conduct of their afiairs.. They direct 
their energies with business-like precision to supply the exact needs of 
the people, we fritter away our enormous political energy in fruitless 
party contests which every year degrade Parliament lower and lower, 
and make it less and less fit for the practical work of governing the 
nation. 
- Qne thing seems certain—unless we can give more attention to the ~ 
vital questions which concern the welfare of the masses, our country 
must go down in the scale of nations. No honest observer can doubt 
that in many respects the Germans are already ahead of us, and they 
are making far more rapid progress than we are. They are applying 
technical science to every department of industry in a way that Pnglish- 
men have little idea of. Their polytechnics and their practical techni- 
cal schools are far ahead of anything we possess in England, the leaders 
are far better trained, the workmen are far better educated and far 
_ more temperate and thrifty than ours are. Wherever the Germans and 
English are coming into competition upon equal terms the Germans 
are beating us. This is not because the Germans have greater natural 
power. I believe the British race is far the more vigorous naturally. 
But they are organized, disciplined, and trained far better than we are. 
‘They bring science to bear upon every department of the national life, 
whereas we, up till lately, resented all state interference, and so exag- 
gerated the doctrines of freedom as almost to glory in our abuses. 
“There is much more I might say if space permitted, but it will not 
‘do to trespass further on your indulgence. I will only add in conelu- 
sion that England must wake up, and that immediately, to the neces- 
sity of a far more thorough and practical system of education, else will 
she lose the great place she has hitherto held in the world’s history.”

GERMAN, AMERICAN, AND FRENCH SCHOOLS COMPARED. 75 
' 
EDUCATION IN EUROPE AND AMERICA. 
Tabular and graphic presentations of the ratio of the entire population 
enrolled in the schools. 
The accompanying presentation is an attempt at a systematic com- 
parison of the efforts in behalf of public education on the part of the 
different nations in Europe and America. While it is instructive in a 
certain sense to hear of the educational efforts of this, that, or the other 
country, it will not suffice to depend on isolated facts. They have their’ 
value only when compared with many or all facts of similar nature, 
If there is anything within the well-defined field of national activ- 
ity which deserves great attention, profound study, and affectionate 
eare, it is public education. A young, vigorous, growing nation like 
America finds itself impelled to institute a comparison with the re- 
markably active nations of the Old World, to see that it will not fall 
behind them in what is considered the noblest national activity; partly 
also to give the educational forces of the nation a fresh impulse in 
showing what has been done in the past and what ought to be done in 
future. It is to be hoped that this attempt at comparison by means of 
graphic presentation will induce the school authorities of other coun- 
tries to take up the question and thus institute a reciprocal action on 
the part of the different nations of the world. 
There are various lines of inquiry pointed out by the different stand- 
ards of comparison. A fruitful comparison would needs be in regard 
to internal as well as external conditions. Among the various subjects 
of inquiry the following may seem the most external: (1) What is the 
number of children and the ratio of the population inschool? (2) What 
is the aggregate cost of maintaining the schools and the sum per cap- 
ita? (3) The number of teachers and the number of pupils per‘capita? 
(4) The ratio of professional teachers? and many other interesting and 
instructive inquiries. The field of inquiry is so vast, the information 
so far gathered so scanty and fragmentary, that much searching and 
extensive correspondence will be necessary to obtain the desired ‘mate- 
rial, 
Hence it is that this presentation begins with one question only, the 
one which seems to lie nearest, namely: “‘ What ratio of the population 
of each nation in Hurope and America is under school influence?” This 
seems a simple question, but it is most difficult to answer, because the 
‘statistical material collected is defective or fragmentary, and the facts 
here are offered not without misgivings of being criticised, but they are 
what the present state of statistics allows. In the result of our inquiry 
we have systematically excluded from the count all institutions, such as 
“infant schools” in France and “kindergarten” in Germany and the 
United States, belonging to the prescholastic age.     
           
-P-A-G-E-144
                                16 “EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. - 
We have also excluded all professional schools, such as universities, 
polytechnic, medical, and pharmaceutical schools, conservatories of 
music and art schools, i in short, all special schools, except normal schools, 
not because we do not think them special and professional, tor they are 
and needs should be, but because they are not sufficiently designated as 
special schools in the statistical mater ial at hand. Most normal schools 
are academic institutions in part, some are academic exclusively, and 
the limit where academic instraction ends and professional begins is 
not well defined. Hence the inclusion of normal school students in the 
“sum total of “children in school.” 
This then brings the age, commonly called ‘school age,” within the 
years six and eighteen. These numbers are not in every case and in 
all nations the same, bat where deviations oceur they are so stated in 
explanatory notes following each chart. 
Many blanks are seen on the accompanying. charts, bat it needs no 
prophetic eye to see the trend and bent of the times; it is, in the lan- 
guage of Diesterweg: “Education of the people is liberation of the 
people.”

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT. 
Area—Population—Civil Divisions.—Great Britain, constitutional 
monarchy; area (England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland) 121,186 square 
miles; population (census 1881), 34,384,848. England and Wales, 
58,186 square miles; population (census of 1881), 25,974,439 ; estimated 
population, 1889, 29,015,613. 
The civil divisions of England are various and complicated.!| The 40 
English and 12 Welsh counties are divided into 14,946 poor law or civil 
parishes, 4. ¢., districts in each of which a separate poor rate may be 
levied; but the same ground is covered by about 13,000 ecclesiastical 
parishes, and again by 14,777 highway parishes; nor is this enumera- 
tion exhaustive. These divisions have been made at different times 
and for various purposes, without any regard to previous boundaries. 
Moreover, the units of a division may be combined; thus for purposes 
of poor-law administration the civil parishes are formed into 649 unions, 
25 of which are single parish unions. It is desirable to have this fact

in mind on account of the relation of parishes and unions to school 
boards. Thus in 1889 there were in England and Wales, besides the 
London board, 162 municipal boards and 2,111 boards including 2,983 
parishes, Boards of the last class comprised in some cases a single 
parish, and in other cases parish unions, 
EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF ENGLAND. 
The conditions under which education is fostered in England are in 
many respects similar to those characteristic of the United States. In 
neither country are the different departments of education welded into 
a system as they are in France, and as are secondary and superior in- 
structionin Germany. The words “ secondary ” and “superior” are in- 
deed not terms of precision in the English-speaking countries, and in 
Great Britain are not so generally used as the specific expressions, uni- 
versity, college, and school. The universities and colleges of England, 
under their acts of incorporation and subsequent acts, have control over 
their own affairs, being subject to government only in respect. to the 
fulfillment of their charter obligations. ; 
From this independence there results a diversity of institutions and 
an individuality in each, greater even than are noticeable in our own 
country. In England, also, as in the United States, technical and in- 
dustrial training are matters of recent interest, deriving their support. 
chiefly from municipal and private sources. ‘Finally, in both countries 
there is a distinct and very positive recognition of puis responsibility 
with respect to elementary education. 
In their practical operations, however, the scholastic institutions of 
England differ widely from those of the United States. 
‘ Until a very recent period superior education was the privilege of a 
select class; secondary education is much less widely diffused than in 
our own country, indeed is scarcely within the reach of the common peo- 
‘ple, while in its present stage the elementary system resembles that 
of our own country in little save the recognition of public responsibility 
in the matter. f 
In the absence of organic union between the higher grades of institu- 
tions in England, the expression ‘educational system,” as there used, is 
understood to mean the system of elementary schools. Before entering . 
upon the detailed consideration of the system, taking the word in its 
limited sense, it is desirable to note the salient characteristics of the 
provision for secondary and superior education. 
UNIVERSITIES AND DETACHED COLLEGES. 
Omitting London University, which is an examining body, there are 
in England four universities, Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, and Victoria, 
and about fourteen independent or “detached” colleges, as they are 
called, to distinguish them from colleges included in the university 
   
-P-A-G-E-150
      80 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
foundations. Each of these institutions is a law to itself within its 
charter limits in respect to studies, discipline, the composition of the 
teaching force, and internal administration. 
The universities receive annual grants from the Crown or by vote of 
Parliament for specific purposes. For example, Oxford has about 
$5,000 applied to the payment of public professors (Report of Oxford 
University Commission, 1852, p. 127) ; but these grants are an insignifi- 
cant item in the total income. 
The budget for 1888-89 contained, for the first time, a small appropria- 
tion ($264,550) to provincial colleges. The main support of all these 
institutions is derived from the income of their endowments and from 
tuition fees. 
According to the report of the universities commission (1872) the total 
income of Oxford and Cambridge universities, including all their col- 
leges, in 1871, was £754,405 5s, 1$d., or about $3,770,000. Of thisamount, 
Siper cent. was included under the head of external income, that is, 
income from properties. 
Professional schools of theology are included in the older universities, 
and endeavors are made also to attract to them professional students 
in law and medicine. Cambridge has been particularly active in fur- 
nishing the scientific equipment necessary for a strong medical course. 
Professional education is, however, pursued mostly outside of the uni- 
‘versities. The principal medical schools of the country are found in the. 
cities, being maintained in connection with the great hospitals. London, 
it need hardly be said, is the chief seat of this work. According to the 
present system of edict licenses established by the medical act of 
1858, the universities, and certain medical corporations, in all nine- 
teen bodies, are recognized as the licensing authorities. Every person 
holding a license, diploma, or degree from one of these licensing author- 
ities, is thereby entitled to have his name entered upon the Medical | 
Register which was instituted by the act, and declared to bean exhaust- 
ive list of the medical Gastpiionacs known to the English law. 
The “Inns of Court,” often characterized as a great “university of 
law,” exercise a controlling influence over preparation for, and admis- 
sion to the legal profession.

AGENCIES FOR SCIENCE, TECHNICAL, AND ART INSTRUCTION. 
Through the Science and Art Department the Government gives 
support to scientific, technical, and art training. This work is also pro- 
moted by many institutions founded by individuals, by manufacturing 
companies, by public subscriptions, and by the great trade guilds. 
Most prominent in this respect among the guilds is the “City Livery 
Companies,” which, in 1879, established ‘The City and Guilds of Lon- 
don Institute” for the purpose of fostering technical instruction in the 
metropolis and in provincial manufacturing towns. London has natu- 
rally been the chief field for the operations of the institute, but several

EDUCATIONAL ‘SYSTEM OF ENGLAND. pias 
other cities, notably Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield, and Bradford, 
have also. become great centers | of technical training through the com- 
bined action of this and the various other agencies mentioned. Under- 
the general head of technical instruction may be included also the Royal ne 
Naval College at Greenwich, the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, 
and the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. 
SECONDARY SCHOOLS. 
Secondary education is the province of three classes of schools—en- 
dowed, proprietary, and private. This classification has respect to 
their social rather than their educational relations. Pupils enter at 
about 7 years of age, and continue until 14, 16, or 18 years of age. 
The endowed schools, like the universities, derive their income from 
property and fees. It has been recently estimated that the yearly 
income from educational endowments in England, universities and 
schools included, is about $10,000,000. 
The endowed schools include the nine great public schools,! which are 
attended almostexclusively by the sons of the nobility and the wealthier © 
middie classes. In 1868 the aggregate income of the nine schools was 
$325,000. There are also above 800 endowed grammar. schools whose 
ag gregate income amounted in 1865 to $1,385,000. The number of en- 
dowed schools of all classes is above 4,000. ‘ 
Although many of the endowments were intended by their founders 
for the benefit of the poor, they have been very generally diverted from 
that purpose, and tlfe institutions which they maintain, like the pro- 
prietary and private schools, minister to those who can afford to pay for 
the instruction of their children. Hence the expression “middle class,” 
so commonly applied to the schools which earry instruction beyond the 
elements. The endowed schools act of 1869 constituted a commission 
for the reorganization of endowed schools chiefly with a view to extend- 
ing their benefits. 
The proprietary schools are the property of individuals, companies, 
or corporations; private schools are the property of the masters or mis- 
tresses who conduct them. The list of agencies for secondary instruc- 
tion includes also “ ladies’ colleges,” most of which, like the semina- 
ries for young women in our own country, combine, in some measure, 
secondary and superior courses. 
No recent reliable statistics of these ro classes of secondary 
schools have been collected.

SYSTEM OF ELEMENTARY EDUCATION,! f 
_ Relation of the state to.—Elementary education was carefully organ- - 
‘ized by the education act of 1870. By this act the Government assumed 
_ the responsibility of securing adequate accommodation in public 
elementary schools for all children of school age in England and Wales, 
an interest which had hitherto been left to private initiative. Theterri- 
  
1 The sources of information that have been consulted for the preparation of this 
bi Goris statement are the education acts, 1870, 1873, 1876, annual reports of the education 
i ; department, reports of city boards, report of the royal commission appointed in 1884 
a to investigate the operations of the system, and educational journals which make 
ae weekly records of its movement. ‘

    Sa a EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF ENGLAND, ss 83 
tory was divided into school board districts, provision made for the 
election of boards and the rates (i, ¢., local taxes) made contributory to be 
the work. In case of the failure of the rate-payers of a district to take 
" action the Government stepped in and ordered the election of. boards. 
Government grants for education which dated from 1833 were greatly 
increased and their application extended. Through the operations of 
this act in six years school attendance was doubled. 
The system is under the fostering care of the state, which provides 
the greater portion of the funds: for its maintenance directly from the 
public treasury in the form of an annual parliamentary grant, and exer- 
cises a large measure of control over its operations. 
The policy of the Government, however, in the management of this 
great interest, is that of stimulating and aiding local effort. This is 
done not only by requiring the rate-payers of school districts to take the 
initiative in providing school accommodation, but further, by the ex- 
tension of Government aid to schools established by denominational 
or private effort, provided that their managers fulfill specified condi- 
tions. In all cases the Government grant is proportioned to the amount 
of local fands raised. 
Schools, how established.—The system includes two distinct classes of 
schools, viz, board and voluntary ; the former established by the school 
boards elected by the rate-payers; the latter chiefly church schools, 
put including also a small number of private undenominational schools. 
The voluntary schools at the present time make provision for about 
two-thirds of the school-going children, These schools bear witness to 
the zeal of religious bodies in respect to education. In Hngland, as 
in other countries, they began the work of instructing the young. Their 
ideal was developed from the Christian consciousness of the church ; it 
had chief reference to the moral nature and immortal destiny of people, 
_ and led naturally to the employment of formal religious instruction as 
the chief means of human enlightenment. 
The board schools are the outcome of the political consciousness of © 
the nation, which developed rapidly from the time of the passage.of 
the reform act of 1832. Although the two ideals have much in com- » 
mon, they have come to conflict at many points; at this moment it is | 
apparent that the later ideal is to prevail over the earlier. 
The record of the progress of this dual system since 1870, the date 
‘of its organization, is interesting and suggestive. In that year 8,281 
voluntary schools came into relation with the department. They had 
accommodations for 1,878,584 pupils, and an average attendance of 
1,152,389 ; the former number being a little over 8 per cent. of the pop: 
lation at that date. 
The following statistics bring into comparative view the two classes 
of schools at the date of the latest report. The present enrollment is 
slightly above 16 per cent. of the present estimated population. The 
average attendance shows an increase of 220 per cent. over that of 1870,

  Under the codes, i. e., annual regulations of the Educational Depart- 
- ment, preceding that of 1890 the larger proportion of the grant allowed 
each school depended upon the number of pupils passing the Goyern- 
ment examination. Hence, the number present on the day of the in- 
spector’s visit was an important item in the statistics. In 1889 this 
number was 4,307,979, 4. ¢., boys, 2,228,341; girls, 2,079,638. Of the 
registered pupils 31.34 per cent. were under 7 years of age; 64.43 per 
cent. between 7 and 14, and 4.23 per cent. above 14 years of age. 
Finances —The funds for the support of board schools are derived — 
chiefly from local rates, fees, and the government grant; those for the 
support of voluntary schools from endowments, contributions, school 
fees, and the grant. The amount and proportion from each source in 
1888-89 were as follows :

Ratio of school rates to ratable values.—From a careful estimate, it

Extraordinary expenditures—In addition to the current expenditure, 
large sums are annually required for buildings and other permanent 
improvements. 
The education act authorizes boards to secure loans for these pur- 
poses, the repayment being spread over such numbers of years, not ex- 
ceeding fifty, as may be sanctioned by the Education Department. 
In 1889, loans for works of permanent character received by 2,246 
boards amounted to a little more than $5,000,000. poe 
The total amount advanced for this purpose from 1870 to 1889 inclu. 
sive, is estimated at $105,168,365. 
The annual expenditure under this head naturally diminishes as the 
school provision becomes more and more complete. 
ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION. 
Central administration.—The system of elementary education is ad- 
ministered in accordance with the education act of 1870, the subse- 
quent modifying acts of 1873, 1874, and 1876, and the latest annual 
code. 
It is in charge of the Education Department, generally termed the 
Committee of Coungil on Education, composed of lords of the privy 
council.

-ppvoanron | REPORT, “1888-80. 
  86 
The dominal head of ie department i is the lord president of the privy 
council; the active head is a member of the privy council who is called 
the vice president of the committee on education; he represents the de- 
partment in the House of Commons. The department prepares the 
annual code for the regulation of the schools, which is submitted to 
Parliament for approval. Local school authorities are subject to the 
regulations issued by the department, and all contentions respecting 
school matters may be referred to it. The department also distributes 
the Parliamentary grant and makes an annual report upon the con- 
dition of the schools. 5 
Inspectors appointed by the sovereign, upon the recommendation of 
the department, visit the schools each year, examine the pupils, and 
investigate the general condition of the schools. Their report deter- 
mines the amount of grant which each school may claim. Chief in- 
spectors are also appointed for general superintendence over assigned 
sections of the country. 
There are twelve of these superior officials, two of whom are assigned 
_ to the charge of training colleges. The inspectorate is an interesting 
feature of the system, and its operations deserve careful consideration. 
The incumbents of the office are generally university men, not expe- 
rienced in the details of elementary school work. The list includes sev- 
eral names of distinction, notably Matthew Arnold and J..G. Fitch. 
The service which these men have rendered is of great and permanent 
value and well illustrates the advantage to be derived from bringing 
into such a work minds having what. has been happily called ‘intel- 
- lectual detachment.” 
It is very generally asserted, however, that such appointments are 
exceedingly rare, and do not compensate for the disadvantages result- 
‘ing from the ill-directed efforts of the large body of inspectors who 
lack the practical understanding of their duties that previous experi- 
ence in humbler relations with theschools might supply. The questions 
here suggested are constantly discussed, and it is probable that in the 
future at least a fair proportion of Tard may look for promotion: to 
the more lucrative and more distinguished service. i 
Local management.—In pursuance of the policy of fostering local 
effort, large liberty is left to local school authorities in respect to all 
matters not directly affecting the interests of the Government or of the 
general public. 
For the purposes of the education acts England and Wales are 
divided into “ school districts.” These are the metropolis, every bor- 
ough, two only excepted, and each parish. 
School boards may be formed in these districts upon the dpplieabag 
of the rate-payers or by order of the department. A school board 
must be formed in a district whenever there is not adequate provision 
for the children of school age (t. ¢., 5 to 13) in schools recognized by the 
department as efficient.          
-P-A-G-E-157
         “EDUCANTONAE, SYSTEM or ENGLAND. 
The nies “payers elect the boards to serve ‘for three years. They are 
empowered to make by-laws relating to religious teaching, compul- 
sory attendance, ete., and to borrow money for the providing and 
‘enlarging of schoolhouses, subject in each case, however, to the ap- 
proval of the department. Without reference to the department they 
may levy rates and call for funds from the rates to cover deficiencies in 
income. ‘ : 
By-laws relating to religious teaching and attendance must not vio- 
late the clauses in the act which protect religious liberty and prohibit 
sectarian teachings in board schools. 
At the latest date of report the total number of boards (England and 
Wales) was 2,274. Of these, 162 were in boroughs, whose populations 
ranged from 750 upwards, by far the larger proportion, ¢. e. 85 per cent., 
‘comprising each above 5,000 inhabitants. The remaining boards were 
in parishes. Above 75 per cent. of these parishes had less than 2,000 
inhabitants. The election of boards had been compulsory in 36 of the 
boroughs and in 1, 045 of the parishes. ; 
The powers, save only that relating to the raising of money, may be 
delegated to a board of managers of not less than three persons. This 
privilege is exercised to some extent by the school boards of London 
and Liverpool with apparently good results. The Birmingham board, 
which has always been one of the most progressive in England, has no 
managers, but employs a corps of paid inspectors, and in addition seeks 
in various ways to promote the interest of parentsin the schools and to. 
establish bonds of union between parents and teachers. 
If a.school district be nut within the jurisdiction of a board, a school 
attendance committee may be appointed in a borough by the town coun- 
cil; ina parish by the guardians. They must report infractions of 
the law with respect to school attendance or the employment of chil- 
dren. Such committees have been appointed in 125 municipal boroughs 
and in 649 other districts. The population of England and Wales 
    under school boards in 1889 was 16,481,753, and under school attendance - 
committees 9,492, ee or a total equivalent to one per cent of the entire 
population. 
Voluntary schools are not under the school boards, but are controlled 
by their own committees. Local authorities of all classes are termed 
in general “managers.” They are responsible for the conduct of their 
schools, for their maintenance in efficiency, and for the provision, of all 
needful furniture, books, and apparatus, and in particular of— 
(a) Suitable registers. i 
{b) A portfolio to contain official letters. 
(c) A diary or log book. 
(d) A cash book. ‘

THE TEACHING FORCE. 
Classification and qualifications.—The teaching force for elementary 
_ instruction comprises pupil-teachers, assistant. teachers, provisionally 
certificated teachers, certificated teachers, and evening-school teachers. 
A pupil-teacher is a boy or girl engaged by the managers of a public 
elementary day school on condition of teaching during school hours 
under the superintendence of the principal teacher and receiving suit- 
able instruction. 
' The managers are bound to see that the pupil-teacher is properly 
instructed during the engagement, and the department, if satisfied that 
this duty is neglected, may decline to recognize any pupil-teachers as 
members of the staff of a school under the same managers. 
Candidates, in order to be engaged as pupil-teachers, whether at the 
end of a year of probation or without probation, must be presented to 
the inspector for approval at his annual visit, must produce certificates 
as to health, character, and attainments, and must pass an examina- 
tion in the work of the two highest years of the elementary school. 
They must be not less than fourteen years of age at the beginning of 
their engagement. The engagement may be for four, for three, or for 
two years. 
Pupil-teachers who have passed certain specified examinations may 
be recognized as assistant teachers, or if specially recommended by the 
inspector on the ground of their practical skill, may be recognized as pro- 
visionally certificated teachers in charge of small schools. No certifi- 
cate (i. é., diploma) is issued to provisionally certificated teachers, nor 
can they serve in this capacity after the completion of the twenty-fifth 
year of their age. 
To be recognized as an assistant teacher one must have passed the 
Queen’s scholarship examination, which admits to a training college, or 
some one of the examinations recognized by the department. These 
include, among others, the university higher local examinations, and 
the College of Preceptor’s examination for the teacher’s diploma.' 
Teachers, in order to obtain certifi¢ates, must be at least twenty 
_ years of age; must pass two examinations at an interval of one year or 
more, and must have given satisfactory proots of their professional abil- 
ity in actual service for two years as provisionally certificated, orfor one 
year as assistants, before they can be admitted to the first examination. 
There is but one class of certificates, but a distinction is made as 
regards the rights to superintend pupil-teachers. 
A certificate may at any time be recalled or suspended, but not until 
the department have informed the teacher of the charges against him 
and given him an opportunity of explanation. 
In estimating what is the minimum school staff required, the depart- 
tment consider the principal certificated teacher to be sufficient for an 
eee

  average attendance of seventy if trained, and of sixty if untrained, each 
assistant teacher for an average attendance of fifty, each pupil-teacher 
for an average attendance of thirty, each candidate for a pupil-teacher- 
ship on probation for an average attendance of twenty. : 
The teachers of day schools must belong to the laity, a restriction 
which does not hold in respect to evening classes. 
Appointments, salaries, pensions.—Teachers are appointed and their 
Salaries adjusted by school boards, or in the case of voluntary schools, 
by the managers thereof. There is no uniform scale of salaries, The 
average salary of certificated masters is now £119 12s. ($590), as against 
£94 is. ($470) in 1870. The average salary of a certificated school-mis- 
tress is £75 9s. ($378), which is about tle same as in 1870. 
The following table shows the several grades of salaries, and the 
number of certi ficated teachers in receipt of each.

(1889) was composed as follows: 1 
4 Certificated toachers : 
Male .. 
Female 
Assistant teachers : 
Male. .. 
Female 
Pupil-teachers 
        ' The great and increasing proportion of female teachers is a matter 
. noted in each successive report. In 1869, out of every 100 teachers of 
‘each class, 48 certificated teachers, 60 assistant teachers, and 57 pupil- 
teachers were women; in 1889 these proportions were 60, 75, and 74 
respectively. 
Training of teachers.—The expression ‘trained teachers i is applied 
to those who have passed through a training college under Government 
inspection. \ 
Demand vs. supply of trained teachers.—In 1889 these colleges! were 
attended by 3,294 students, which is very nearly the entire number for 
which they afford accommodation. 
This attendance would furnish a yearly supply of 1,500 teachers hav- 
ing two years’ training, a supply which would be amply sufficient to fill 
up the waste in a staff of 25,000 teachers or a little more than half the 
number of certificated teachers actually engaged in the schools. One of 
the most important problems at present under consideration is the , 
means of increasing the provision for training teachers. 
In discussing this subject in their aeLOR for 1889-90 the committee of 
council say: 
The extent to which the training colleges have contributed to the present supply 
of efficient teachers in England and Wales is shown by the fact that of 18,250 
masters employed in schools reported on in 1888-89, 11,559, or 63.34 per cent. haa 
been trained for two years, and 909, or 4.98 per cent., for less than two years; 
while 5,782, or 31.68 per cent., were untrained. In like manner, of 27,184 school- 
mistresses, 11,502, or 41.31 per cent., had been trained for two years; 893, or 3.28 per 
cent., for less than two years; and 14,789, or 54.41 per cent., were untrained. 4 
Of the teachers, however, who, from whatever cause, have not attended a training 
_ college, a considerable proportion can not, except in a technical sense of the word, be 
classed as untrained, having, under the superintendence of some of the best teachers, 
passed through the pupil-teacher’s course and served as assistants in large schools 
before passing the examination for a certificate and undertaking independent 
charges. 
Under present conditions, a considerable number of teachers who 
- have not passed through the training college will always be required for 
service in the small schools of the country, since the trained masters, 
ean not be secured for schools that offer less than $500 a year for head ~

or assistant masters, and even the salaries commanded by women after 
two years of training are beyond the means of the majority of small 
schools. Pees 
SUBJECTS OF INSTRUCTION. 
The obligatory subjects of elementary instruction in day schools are 
reading, writing, and arithmetic, with needlework for girls and drawing, 
for boys in schoois for older scholars. These subjects are arranged in 
seven grades, called standards. Pupils must pass an examination in 
each standard before passing to the next, and as the examinations are 
annual it follows that a standard is equivalent to a year. 
Additional subjects may be included in the programme, to be taken 
either by classes or by individuals. Pupils may be drawn from one or 
' more standards, 4. e., grades, for instruction in the class subjects, exam- 
inations in the same being conducted by classes and not by individuals. 
The subjects comprised in this category are singing, recitation. (7. ¢., of 
literary selections), English, geography, elementary science, drawing for 
boys in infant schools and classes, needlework for girls (optional as a 
class subject). ‘ 
The following subjects may be taken by individuals who have passed 
the fourth standard, intended to be reached by pupils at 10 years of 
age: : i 
Algebra, Euclid and mensuration, mechanics, chemistry, physics, 
animal physiology, botany, principles of agriculture, Latin, French, 
domestic economy (for girls), Welsh (for scholars in schools in Wales), 
German, bookkeeping; shorthand, according to some system recog- 
nized by the department; cookery and laundry work may be taken by 
girls. ‘ 
“Any subject, other than those mentioned above, may, if sanctioned 
by the department, be taken as a specific subject, provided that a grad- 
uated scheme for teaching it be submitted to and approved by the in- — 
' spector. g i 
Instruction may be given in other secular subjects, and in religious 
subjects, but no grant is made in respect to any such instruction; as a 
rule little is attempted beyond thie official programme. 
Actual state of the schools as regards subjects of instruction.—An in- 
teresting view of the actual scholastic work of the schools is presented 
in the report of the annual examinations for 1888-89. The number of 
schools comprised in the report is 19,310, i. ¢., 99 per cent. of the entire 
number, and enrolling 99 per cent. of the pupils, or practically the 
whole school attendance. About 30 per cent. of these pupils were in 
infant schools. Of the 70 per cent. in the schools for older pupils, 
2,580,720 were presented for examination. From the report it appears 
that whereas as many as 1,410,626 being over 10 years of age, ought to 
have been presented in Standards IV-VII, only 962,565 were so pre- 
sented, while 448,061 (or 31.76 per cent.) were presented in standards 
               
-P-A-G-E-162

suited for children of seven, eight, and nine years of age. These — 
_ figures, however, show marked improvement over the condition of 
former years. Thus, in 1883-84, of the children over 10 years of age, 
42,77 per cent. were presented in standards below the 4th; while in 
1878-79 the proportion above 10 years of age in the lower standards 
was 59 per cent. In other words, there has been during the decade a 
gain of 65 per cent. in the proportion of children over 10 years of age in 
standards appropriate to them. 
The grant for class subjects was claimed by 89.91 per cent. of the 
schools for older scholars, having an average attendance of 2,511,057, 
and was allowed for 86.82 per cent. of the schools on the basis of an 
average attendance of 2,465,486, that is, 94 per cent. of all older scholars. 
English, ¢. ¢., grammar and grammatical analysis, was the first class 
subject in all cases. : 
In 70.98 per cent. of the schools, grants were claimed for two 
class subjects. In the majority, 7. e., 76.50 per cent., geography was the 
second class subject. Optional needlework (girls), history, and ele- 
mentary science made up the remaining number. 
In their report the committee of council say: 
The wider range of class subjects allowed by the code under the head of “< clement- 
-ary science” does not appear to be taken advantage of to any great extent at present. 
The returns show but 36 schools which have taken subjevts under this head. 
The 10 per cent. of schools in which no class subject was taken were 
evidently small schools. They comprised only 4 per cent. of the aver- 
age attendance of scholars, while the average “number for payment” 
in each of them was 47, as against 127 in the schools which secured 
payment for class subjects and 66 in the schools which failed. 
As to specific subjects, it appears that 14.83 per cent. of the scholars 
eligible for examination in these subjects were so examined. 
- The London school board district furnished a large proportion, viz, 
39 per cent. of this number; board schools of that district surpassing 
the voluntary schools in this respect in the proportion of 7 to 3. 
The results of the examinations in specific subjects were as follows: 
Number examined.

  The subjects giving the highest namber of passes were algebra, 30 
per cent.; domestic economy, 24 per cent.; animal physiology, 18 per 
cent. French followed at a distance, having 7 per cent. 
The examination developed the fact that cookery had been taught in 
1,355 departments ; 57,539 girls gaining the grant for this brancb. 
Military drill, which (as distinguished from the ordinary school drill 
practiced in every good school) was first recognized by the code of, 
1871, is systematically taught to the boys attending 1,414 day schools.

“EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF ENGLAND. | 936 
Drawing, which has just been made an obligatory subject for boys, 
is not a new feature of the programme. In 1885 it was pursued in 
4,637 elementary schools, and over halfa million children passed examin- 
ation in the eleinentary stages. Owing to changes in the status of the 
subject, it declined for a while, but the lost ground has apparently been 
recovered, as in 1889 the number of children examined in this branch 
was very nearly $50,000. In Leeds, where drawing has been especially 
developed, the school board employ an art inspector, at a salary of £350 
($1,750). ' : 
The scheme of elementary study considered as a whole is an inter- 
esting illustration of the conflicting views of the scope and purposes 
of elementary education, under which it has been framed. The narrow 
range of obligatory subjects accords with the opinion of a large class 
of English statesmen, who hold that inthe interests of economy and 
public content the education of the people should be confined to the 
rudiments of knowledge. 
The class subjects are a concession to those more liberal-minded men 
who realize that the rudiments are in themselves lifeless, while in the 
larger opportunities which the scheme offers to individuals there is a 
hint of the relation that elementary instruction should bear to com- 
plete education. As it now stands, the scheme is not codrdinated to: 
or in unison with any other part of the educational provision of the 
country. Its deficiencies in this respect are radical, as is shown when- 
ever the endeavor is made to bring the elementary schools into direct 
relations with higher institutions. 
Notwithstanding these inherent difficulties, however, many indi-: 
vidual pupils in the elementary schools have been successfully pre- 
pared for secondary schools, and have eventually gained distinction as 
university students. These higher provisions are made available to a 
limited number of elementary school pupils by scholarships created 
for the purpose and secured by competitive examination. The London 
board possesses fourteen such scholarships, ranging in value from 
$125 to $175. Additional scholarships are also annually placed at the 
disposal of this board. One of the practical results uf the passage of 
students from the elementary schools to the higher institutions oflearn: _ 
ing is an increased recognition of the need of better adjustments be- 
tween the courses of study of different classes of schools. 
CONDUCT OF STUDIES AND DISCIPLINE. 
Intellectual tone of the schools.—The prevailing methods of instruction 
in elementary schools affect individual minds and characters even more 
than do the subjects of instruction. These methods depend. upon the — 
professional qualification of the teacher and the demands which he is 
constrained to meet. In the English system, the one overshadowing 
influevee is the inspector’s annual examination, since upon the report of 
this official depends the amount of grant that a school may claim. The 
    
 
-P-A-G-E-164
EDUCATION REPO i 1888 89. 
  4 scheme of study already presented is a smintan indication, of the 
Government requirement, which guides the work of both teacher and 
‘examiner. This is first and foremost, a definite, although very mea- 
ger, attainment in reading, writing, and arithmetic. 3 
Experience has proved that children can be brought to the required 
proficiency in these subjects by drill of a mechanical kind, which imma- 
ture and inferior teachers can use as effectively as the able and ex- 
perienced. Pupil-teachers, however promising they may appear, lack 
both maturity and experience, and the tendency to grinding routine, 
inseparable from the peculiar system of examinations, is increased by 
the large proportion of this class of teachers, who constitute 30 per cent, 
of the entire force. 
_ The low limit of attainment hitherto required for exemption from 
school attendance, viz: the fourth standard, which may be reached at 
10 years of age, and actually is reached at that age by two-thirds of 
the children, has tended also to keep the work of the schools within 
narrow lines. Under these circumstances, professional skill and phil- 
-osophical insight, which are not wanting to the teaching fraternity of 
England, count for little. Teachers, school board officials, and others 
have been urgent in their endeavors to secure some relief from these 
depressing conditions, and while as yet they have failed in effecting 
radical changes they have met with some measure of success. 
The code of 1890 provides some relief from these depressing condi- 
tions; it allows the teacher greater freedom in the classification of pu- 
_ pils than heretofore, greatly reduces the amount of individual examina- 
_ tion, and gives larger credit for excellence in the general conditions of 
the schools, and raises the age of exemption from 10 to 12 years. These 
concessions have revived the efforts of those who advocate more natural 
methods of instruction and a larger range of obligatory subjects. 
Moral quality.—While the average intellectual standard of the Eng- 
lish elementary schools (if both urban and rural schools be included) is 
‘not high, the moral quality is positive and pervasive. 
This is a very natural consequence of the part which the Church has 
taken in the establishment and maintenance of the schools. It’ is 
further attributable to the influence of the training colleges, through 
which the majority of the head teachers have passed, which colleges 
being denominational schools are deeply penetrated with the religious 
spirit. The attitude of the Government accords with this spirit. A 
-_ portion of the parliamentary grant is allowed upon the inspector's re- 
port as to the organization and discipline of a school. In recommend- 
ing this grant the inspector is instructed to have— 
Special regard to the moral training and conduct of children, to the neatness and 
order of the school premises and furniture, and to the proper classification of the 
scholars, both for teaching andexamination, * * \* To meet the requirements re- 
specting discipline the managers and teachers will be expected to satisfy the inspector 
that all reasonable care is taken in the ordinary management of the school to 
bring up the children in habits of punctuality, of good manners and language, of

cleanliness and neatness, and also to impress upon the children the importance of 
cheerful obedience to duty, of consideration and respect for others, and of honor and 
trothfulness in word and act. The inspector ‘should also satisfy himself that the 
teacher has not unduly pressed those who are dull or delicate in preparation for ex- 
amination at any time of the year. 
Methods of instruction.—Instruction by repetition is a method ‘much 
in vogue in English schools. One pupil repeats after the teacher and a 
second pupil after the first, until by dint of reiteration the matter is 
mastered. i 
Concert repetition is also 2 common exercise. In the teaching of | 
arithmetic more attention seems to be given to drill in processes than , 
to the analysis of principles and relations. Object lessons are employed 
in infant schools and in those for older pupils, but more generally take 
the form of talks by the teacher than of instruction based eon per: 
ception and observation. 
Among many exeellent features of the system we may note that in- 
fant schools have been the subject of special care and thought, and 
many of them approach very near the ideal formulated by Mr. Fitch. 
“The English ideal of an infant school,” says Mr. Fitch, “as one in 
which elementary instruction in reading, writing, and counting is inter- 
spersed with simple lessons on the phenomena of nature and of common 
life, and with interesting and varied manual employment, has not pre- 
yailedin America. I confess I greatly prefer it. It seems to me to put 
what are commonly called kindergarten methods and discipline into 
their proper place, rather as organic parts of a good and rounded sys- 
tem of juvenile acquisition of knowledge than as constituting even in 
the earliest years a separate organization, having aims and principles 
different from those which should prevail during the rest of the. school 
life.” 2 ‘4 
These infant schools are most numerous in crowded city districts, and 
with their games, songs, and free converse bring light and joy to multi-. 
tudes of children belonging to the poorest classes. 
Sewing and cookery as developed in the large cities and in certain 
districts, especially of Yorkshire, greatly increase the influence of the 
schools over the home life of the poor. 
Clay modeling has been introduced to some extent in infant schools, 
and is attempted occasionally in schools for older scholars in con- 
nection with drawing. Manual training experiments have been started 
in a few cities, and in June, 1890, the Science and Art Department | 
announced that grants would be made toward the maintenance of man- 
ual classes in connection with the teaching of Creve in the element- 
ary schools. 
By recitation in English schools is meant the verbatim repetition of 
assigned selections from the writings of the best authors, an exercise

EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
upon which much stress is laid in the higher standards. Another very 
- valuable language exercise which is much used, although not included 
in the obligatory course, is the ‘analysis of words, and the grouping to- 
gether of those having a common root. ¥\ 
What is known as the peripatetic plan of instruction has been suc- 
cessfully employed for science classes in Birmingham, Sheffield, Man- 
chester, Huddersfield, and other manufacturing towns, and also in Lon- 
don, By this plan a special teacher, accompanied oftentimes with an 
~ assistant and equipped with a portable laboratory, goes from school to 
school to conduct classes. Physical training, as we have already seen, 
is not entirely ignored. The Swedish system of gymnastics has been 
introduced extensively into the London schools for girls. Swimming 
classes for boys have also been formed in some schools of the metropolis 
‘and of other cities. ’ 
Lessons in thrift and economy are enforced by the maintenance of 
savings banks, or by use of the post-office savings system. In 1889 the 
number of schools reporting penny banks was 2,509, which is very 
nearly three times the number reported in 1884, 
, From an exhaustive inquiry made in the board schools of London in 
. 1887, it appeared that very few banks had been established in the 
schools, but the post-office system was popular. 
The way in which this system was operated in the schools is thus 
described in the report of the investigation: 
The working of the system is in this wise: On a Monday morning a teacher takes 
the moneys saved by each scholar, froma penny up to a shilling, and enters each 
amount in a cash book opposite the scholar’s name. As several amounts are thus 
entered they ave transferred to a ledger, whence the total savings of each scholar can 
.be seen. Having done this the teacher sends the total sum received on the Monday 
to the nearest post-office and obtains a deposit receipt in an ordinary savings-bank 
book, which serves as a pass book. 
Again, that which is known as the stamp plan is used in a few schools, the teacher 
supplying stamps to the scholars for the purpose of being affixed to a form which is 
also supplied to each scholar. When a dozen stamps have been thus affixed the form is 
sent to the post-office and an account is opened. In that case no cash book or ledger 
is kept at the school.! . 
With respect to text-books the local managers have entire freedom, 
and.the text-book trade flourishes in England. The books are not, 
however, comparable either in respect to contents or to typographical 
finish with those used in the United States or upon the Continent. 
Efforts are also made to supply schools with general reading matter ; 
in 1888-89 school libraries were reported from 4,311 schools, or about 
one-fifth of the whole number. 
Discipline. —The discipline of the schools is as various as we find it in 
our own country. Carporal punishment is very generally employed, 
but is guarded in many ways. 
The London board, for instance, prohibits any but head teachers from 
inflicting it, and orders a detailed record of each case to be made.

  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF ENGLAND. 97 
Parents are quite sensitive in this matter, aud it is not uncommon to 
hear of teachers being summoned before magistrates to answer charges 
of assault. : 
ORGANIZATION OF SCHOOLS. 
The organization of elementary schools is regulated to some extent by 
the provisions of the education acts and code, but beyond this, is left 
entirely to local managers. 
Essential characteristics of elementary schools.—An elementary school 
is defined by the education act “to be a school in which elementary 
edueation is the principal part of the education given,” and does not in- 
clade any school or department in which the ordinary payments in re- 
spect to. the instruction, from each scholar, exceed ninepence a week. 
in reality the weekly fee is seldom as high as ninepence. In 1889-90 
52.67 per cent. of the pupils in England and Wales paid less than 3d. a 
week; 38.63 per cent. paid between 3d. and 6d., and 3.75 per cent. paid 
6d. and over; 4.95 per cent. were free scholars. : 
in order to be classed as a ‘‘ public elementary school,” a school must 
be bound by the “conscience clause” of the act, which reads as follows: 
It shall not be required, as a condition of any child being admitted into or contin- 
ag in the school, that he shall attend or abstain from attending any Sunday school 
or any place of religious worship, or that he shall attend any religious observance or 
any instruction in religious subjects in the school or elsewhere, from which observ- 
ance or instruction he may be withdrawn by his parent, or that he shall if withdrawn 
by his parent, attend the school on any day exclusively set apart for religious ob- 
servance by the religious body to which his parent belougs. 
The time or times during which any religious observance is practiced or instruction 
in seligious subjects is given at any meeting of the school shall be either at the begin- 
ning or at the end, or at the beginning and the end of such meetings, and shall be in- 
serted in a time-table to be approved by the Education Department, and to be kept 
permanently and conspicuously affixed in every school room, and any scholar may be 
withdrawn by his parent from such observance or instruction without forfeiting any 
of the other benefits of the school. 
The school shall be open at all times to the inspection of any of Her Majesty’s in- 
spectors, 80, however, that it shall be no part of the duties of such inspector to inquire 
into any instruction in religious subjects given at such school, or to examine any 
scholar therein in religious knowledge, or in any religious subject or book. 
The school shall be conducted in accordance with the conditions required to be ful- 
filled by an elementary school in order to obtain an annual parliamentary grant, 
      This section is equally binding upon board and voluntary schools; it 
will be noticed that it does not exclude sectarian teaching, but simply 
provides for the withdrawal of children from such instruction if. the 
parents so desire. 
Additional clause respecting religious instruction binding upon board 
schools.—The board schools are bound by an additional clause which 
forbids the teaching of any religious catechism, or religious formulary 
which is distinctive of any particular denomination. 
Special requirements —The time-table must be approved for the 
school by the inspector on behalf of the department, and in a school » 
ED 89——7        
-P-A-G-E-168
        98 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
provided by a school board the consent of the department must have 
been given to the weekly fee prescribed by the board. 
The school must not be established where there is already adequate © 
provision in approved schools, nor conducted for private profit. 
The principal teacher must be certificated, and the school must have 
met at least 400 times during the year. 
In England, as elsewhere, under other systems, individual schools 
present varied degrees of development, and varied modes of opera- 
tion within the limits imposed. 
The board schools, as a rule, have better teachers than the voluntary 
schools, are better organized, and yield better results. This is to be 
‘ expected, as boards control the greater proportion of the schools in the 
cities and thickly settled communities where it is easiest to excite and 
maintain a professional spirit. Moreover the boards being elective 
bodies, the rate-payers have a lively sense of their responsibilities and 
privileges in respect.to the schools, and thus a popular sentiment is 
awakened which is stimulating alike to teachers and to pupils. There 
are, however, many superior voluntary schools, as there are indifferent 
board schools. The Jew’s Free School, of London, is a notable example 
of a school established by the benevolent for the benefit of the poorest 
‘class, thoroughly organized, employing a corps of superior teachers, and. 
holding high rank in all scholarly conditions and results. 
' Special requirements for infant classes and schools.—Infant classes are 
for pupils below seven years of age, but such a class is not recognized if 
the average attendance be less than twenty. The class must be taught 
by a teacher over eighteen years of age, approved by the inspector, if 
the average attendance be above thirty, and by a certificated teacher if 
the average attendance be above fifty. The highest grant can not be 
claimed unless the class is taught in a room of its own, constructed and 
furnished for the work. The number of schools thus equipped steadily 
‘increases. $ i 
In 1889 the number of scholars in the registers of infant schools and 
classes was 1,604,689, and of these 884,834 were instructed in separate 
schools under certificated teachers of their own. 
Night schools.—In order to secure a grant, a night school must have 
at least forty-five sessions during the year. No scholar can be presented 
for examination in-any standard lower than the third, and no scholar 
ean be presented who has not attended the school for eight weeks and 
been present at least twenty-four times since the previous examination. 
In 1889 the number of scholars in average attendance upon night 
schools was 37,118. 
Size and grading of elementary day schools.—The size and grouping of 
schools depend upon various circumstances, of which the principal is 
location, as rural or urban. There are no general statistics bearing 
upon this point beyond the statement that 19,398 schools comprise 29,336 
departments in which separate head teachers are employed. 
The division of the obligatory curriculum into seven standards forms
-P-A-G-E-169
  poe as EDUCATIONAL ‘SYSTEM OF ENGLAND, — 99 
a basis for grading and for grouping pupils. in separate rooms, where 
the school building permits. 
The provision for a wide range of specific subjects open to pupils who 
have passed the elementary examination in any standard above the 
fourth, forms an initial stage in the establishment of what would be 
called in the United States high-school grades or high schools. The 
evolution of these high grades has reached an interesting stage in many 
places, more especially in the provincial manufacturing centers. In 
Bradford it has taken the form of special schools, four in number, 
which are intended as models, including the entire course of study al- 
lowed by the scheme. In Sheffield, Huddersfield, and Birmingham the 
movement is toward what we should call high schools. The rapid in- 
erease of the higher grade departments and schools in the chief cities 
- has excited much discussion in Parliament and among the people. It 
is contended in many quarters that such provision is not authorized by 
the education acts, the same arguments being advanced that have been 
used against public high schools in the United States. 
It is interesting to note, also, that the obligation to train pupil-teachers 
has led many city boards to establish what are called central classes 
for this purpose. Here the pupil-teachers assemble for instruction. 
School buildings and premises.—As regards the school buildings and 
premises, the department must in every case be satisfied— 
That the school premises are healthy, are properly constructed, lighted, warmed, 
drained, and ventilated, are supplied with suitable offices, contain sufficient accommo- 
dation for the scholars attending the school, and are properly provided with furniture, 
books, maps, and other apparatus of elementary instruction. 
The employment of pupil-teachers in the schools existing prior to the 
passage of the education act gave Tse to a peculiar style of school 
room, which is still in use. 
It is long and wide and provided with parallel rows of benches and 
desks, facing the teacher’s desk. It is sometimes so planned that ad- 
ditional benches and desks can be placed at the sides facing toward the 
others. Floor space is left at the sides of the room, where classes are 
drawn up in semicircles for lessons under the pupil teachers, the head 
teacher overlooking all from his position.* 
The simultaneous recitations of different classes make to American 
ears a perfect Babel of confusion.    The Wesleyan school rooms, built before 1870, are modeled on the 
plan advocated by Mit Stow. The principal feature is a gallery wherein 
a collective lesson may be given to a large number of children. These 
galleries accommodate infant classes and are also used for religious 
lessons and exercises. The Wesleyans, however, very early recognized 
the need of class rooms. These open from the main room and, like 
that, are provided with galleries. 
Board school architecture shows the influence of German and Amer. _

jean models, nearly all the buildings recently constructed consisting of 
separate class rooms, with a hall for general assembly. The size of the 
buildings depends necessarily upon the location. In London from 500 
to 1,500 children are provided for in a single edifice.! 
. All new school premises and enlargements must conform to a schedule 
4 published by the department. This schedule prescribes the general 
plan of buildings, the proportions of school rooms, the minimum size of 
class rooms (18 feet by 15), the surface space per scholar—10 square feet 
% in rooms not providing accommodation for more than 60 children, the 
5 height, ¢. ¢., 12 feet from floor level to ceiling for an area of 360 super- 
ficial square feet, 13 feet for a superficial area of 360 to 600 square feet, 
and 14 feet for an area above 600 square feet. The schedule also indi- 
eates the preferred modes of lighting, ventilating, warming, and fur- 
nishing, and gives explicit directions respecting sanitary arrangements. 
A playground is required for every school, and in the case of a mixed 
school separate playgrounds for the boys and the girls. 
_ Half-timers.—Arrangements are made by which children who must 
work may attend school as half-timers. A separate register must be 
kept for these, the attendance of a ‘‘half-timer” for two consecutive 
hours being counted as an attendance and a half. } 
Holidays.—The usual holidays for board schools are two weeks at 
Christmas; at Easter from Good Friday to the Saturday in the next 
week, both days inclusive; at Whitsuntide one week, and in summer 
three weeks, to commence on the first Monday in August. 
School age.—There is no express definition of school age in England 
by statute, but as a rule the following attendances are not recognized 
for grants: (a) Attendance of a child under 3 years of age; (b) of any 
scholar who has passed in the three elementary subjects in the seventh 
standard, unless the inspector has previously permitted such scholars 
i to be reéxamined in that standard; (c) of any scholar in an evening 
: school under fourteen or over twenty-one, but children under fourteen 
who are by the department deemed to be exempt from the legal obliga- 
tion to attend school are recognized as scholars in an evening school. 
Compulsory attendance.—The period of compulsory attendance at 
school is nominally from five to thirteen years of age, but attendance 
may not be enforced against any child of ten years or upwards, who 
has obtained a certificate of proficiency, or of previous due attendance 
at a ‘certified efficient school,” or who is employed and attending school 
in accordance with the factory acts; further, thélocal authorities may, 
under certain conditions, temporarily exempt a child over eight years 
of age, ‘‘ for the necessary operations of husbandry and the ingathering 
' of crops,” for a period not exceeding six weeks ina year. The execu- 
tion of the compulsory clauses of the education acts is left entirely to 
local managers. So far the measures employed have failed of the de- 
  f ‘For interesting description of typical board schools, see series of articles in the 
“Schoolmaster” for 1890.

      sired effect. In London the evils of irregular attendance have become 
alarming; for two years a committee of the school board have had 
the subject under consideration to devise measures of reform. The ap- 
pointment of a special magistrate to hear school-board cases is specially 
urged by them. The Liverpool board employs one set of visitors to 
look after absentees exclusively. 
The fixed limits of compulsory attendance have in reality but little 
significance, on the one hand because of the general institution of infant 
schools which receive special grants, and on the other because of the 
proviso exempting children of ten years of age who have passed in the 
“fourth standard. As already stated, it is expected that pupils shall 
reach the standard at ten years of age. Two-thirds of the pupils fulfill 
this expectation. The statistics show that a little more than one-third 
of this number are seen no more at school, while of the remaining two- 
thirds about one in eight reaches the seventh or highest standard. 
The code for 1890 fixes twelve years and the sixth standard for exemp- 
tions. ‘ 
VARIOUS CHARACTERISTICS. 
Coeducation.—The extent to which coeducation is practiced in the 
English schools may be seen from the fact that of 22,414 departments 
for older pupils, 4,194 were for boys, 3,822 for girls, and 14,398 were 
mixed. . 
Daily sessions and attendance.—The length of a school day and the 
hours of opening and closing are not uniform. The maximum session 
is apparently three hours. In I.ondon the forenoon session is from 9 to 
12, and the afternoon from 2 to 4:30. 
In making up the daily register no attendance for less than an hour 
and a half in each session can be counted for a child in an infant class 
or less than two hours for an older pupil. 
THE ANNUAL GRANT. 
The most’peculiar feature of the elementary system, as well as the 
most important condition affecting the course and conduct of. studies, 
and the organization of the schools, is the mode of distributing the 
, annual grant. This feature has, however, been much modified by the 
Code of 1890, as a consequence of the representation made before the 
Commission on the Operations of the Education Acts. These modi- 
fications reduce the amount of the grant conditional upon the results 
of individual examination and allow much greater freedom to the 
teacher in respect to the classification of. pupils. They recognize, also, 
the peculiar needs of small rural schools, allowing extra grants to 
these of $50, $100, or $125, according to the population and apart 
from other considerations. Under the new code the grant for day 
schools is applied as follows: 2 
PRESENT BASIS OF DISTRIBUTION.

schools, this arrangement allows to infant schools a fixed minimum 
grantof 9s. and a possible maximum grant of 17s. per capita of aver- 
age attendance; to schools for older scholars, a fixed minimum grant 
of 13s. 6d., avd a possible maximum grant of 17s. per capita of aver- 
age attendance, omitting grants for cookery and laundry work, and of 
4s, for each pass in a specific subject. 
The average grant claimed by schools for older scholars for 1889- 90 
amounted to 18s. 44d. per capita of average attendance. 
TRAINING COLLEGES. 
Provision for the training of teachers antedates the education act by 
nearly fifty years, having been one of the special objects of the societies 
that were devoted to the work of educating the people. Training col- 
leges, as they were called, received government aid in 1843; the act of 
1870 merely extended their resources and defined more exactly the 
conditions entitling them to Government support. 
The training colleges for teachers recognized by the department are 
of two classes, residential and day. i : 
Residential training colleges are boarding schools, but they may 
receive day students. A practice school is a required adjunct. 
These schools are voluntary, and, with a single exception, belong to 
_ Some religious denomination or to some one of the religious societies 
devoted to educational work. 
The housing, equipment, staffing, etc., are left entirely to the mana- 
gers, but there must always be a resident physician. 
The following are the specific provisions as to the establishment of 
training colleges and the conditions of admission to them set forth in 
the code for 1890: 
A day training college must be attached to some university or college of university | 
rank, 
The authorities of a day training college must be a local committee who will be 
held responsible for the discipline and moral supervision of the students, and for their 
regular attendance at professional or other lectures. 
No grant is made to a training college unless the department are satisfied with the 
premises, management, staff, curriculum, and general arrangements, and recognize it 
as a training college. 
‘The recognized students in a training college are called Queen’s acholars. 
The authorities of a training college may propose to the department for admission 
as Queen’s scholar— 
(a) Any candidate who has obtained a place in the first or second class at the 
Queen’s scholarship examination; 
           
-P-A-G-E-174
                  104. - EDUCATION REPORT, 1888 9. 
(b) Without examination, any person who has ‘passed the first year’s examination 
_ for a certificate and who wishes to enter the college for a year’s training in the 
course prescribed for students of the second year. 
Before candidates are admitted— 
(a) The medical officer of the college must certify that the state of their health is 
satisfactory and that they are free from serious bodily defect or deformity; and 
(b) They must sign a declaration that they intend bora fide to adopt and follow 
the profession of teacher in a public elementary school or training college or in the 
army or navy or (within Great Britain) in poor law schools, certified industrial or 
day industrial schools, or certified reformatories. 
In other respects the authorities of each college settle their own terms of admission. 
The period of training is ordinarily two years. An additional year’s training may, 
in any case, be allowed on the application of the enibhionuies of the college and with 
the consent of the department. 
Students who are Queen’s scholars and are qualified to attend the examinations for 
certificates, are required to attend both that in first year’s and that in second year’s 
papers, unless prevented by illness or other cause approved by the department. 
Course of study in training colleges.—The course of study in training 
colleges has hitherto been determined by the subjects included in the 
syllabus of the Government examinations for teachers’ certificates. 
These subjects are reading, recitation, penmanship, school management, 
English grammar, composition and rhetoric, geography, English his- 
tory, arithmetic, algebra and mensuration, geometry, political economy 
for men, domestic economy and sewing for women, vocai music, and 
drawing. Candidates may also be examined in one or two of the follow- 
ing languages: Latin, Greek, French, German; and in branches of 
science prescribed in the syllabus of the science and art department. 
One of the most important features of the syllabus is that pertaining 
to the study of English literature. It requires some masterpiece to be 
studied throughout the term and that not less than 300 lines shall be 
committed to memory. The examination syllabus for men differs some- 
what from that for women. The mathematics for the former include 
algebra and geometry in addition to arithmetic, which is the limit for 
women. Men may be examined in two languages, women in but one. 
History is less extended in the syllabus for men, and the political 
economy required for men is much more elementary than the domiesiie 
economy assigned to women. 
The éxisting status of the curriculum here described has just been 
modified as a consequence of the establishment of day training colleges 
» attached to university colleges. The managers of day colleges are free 
to draw up a curriculum of their own, provided that it is sanctioned by 
the department and includes some three or four obligatory subjects. . 
If their students pass examinations for degrees, these will be excepted 
in lieu of the certificate examinations, the department merely requiring 
that the worked papers shall be submitted to it. This arrangement 
seemed to discriminate unjustly between the students of the day and 
those of the residential colleges, since it permitted the former to be ex- 
amined on questions drawn up by their own instructors, while those for 
the latter were set by the department. The authorities of the residen- 
os

105 
tial colleges were naturally dissatisfied and their representations have 
brought about a change. 
Under the new provisions, students in training collegés who pass any 
university examination approved by the department will be excused 
from farther examination in the same subjects or portions of subjects, | 
So far, then, as the provisions go, students of the training colleges 
_may be certificated chiefly on the results of university examinations. 
There are some difficulties in the way of making this privilege practi- 
cally available, but it is a very important departure in respect to the 
training of teachers, opening betore them not only a wider range of 
knowledge, but promising the stimulus of broader and freer views of 
those subjects. 
In addition to the annual examination of persons intending to become 
teachers by the inspector of the education department, there is also an 
« annual examination by officers of the science and art department, upon 
the results of which all Government payments for instruction in science 
are made. ‘ 
Conduct of the training colleges.—The regimen of the training colleges 
is generally very strict, and life within them lacks the individual free- 
dom which, under judicious leadership, promotes the development of 
character. There is also noticeable in these colleges the absence of cer- 
tain stimulating influences that develop naturally among students, 
drawn from various social strata and looking forward to diverse 
careers. 
Among the conditions which tend to narrow the social life of the 
training colleges must be counted their denominational affiliations. 
Theoretically, they are nonsectarian, but as a matter of fact the stu- 
dents of a college are drawn in the main from the denomination it rep- 
resents. 
The establishment of day training colleges in touch with the univer- 
sities is a measure of far-reaching moment promising, as we have indi- 
cated, higher and broader intellectual culture and greater freedom in 
life and thought. 1 
‘Grant to training colleges.—There are placed to the credit of each col- 
lege grants of £100 for every master and £70 for every mistress, who, 
having been trained as a Queen’s scholar during two years, completes 
the prescribed period of probation and receives a certificate as a teacher 
in a public elementary school, or in a training college, or is reported by 
the proper department in each case to have completed a like period of 
good service as an elementary teacher in the army or navy, or (within 
Great Britain) in poor law schools, certified industrial or day industrial 
schools, or certified reformatories. : 
A grant of £20 is made for every master and every mistress who at- 
tends as a day Queen’s scholar and fulfills the remaining conditions here 
specified. Teachers who have been trained for one year only may ob- 
tain certificates after probation, or may be reported by the proper de-_

partment, upon the same terms as others; and grants of half the amounts 
mentioned above may be placed to the credit of the colleges in which 
they were trained under special conditions. 
The annual grant to each residential college is paid out of the sums standing to its 
credit at the beginning of the year, 
- The annual grant to a residential college must not exceed (a) 75 per cent, of the 
expenditure of the college for the year, approved by the department and certified in 
such manner as the department may require; (b) £50 for each male, and £35 for 
each female Queen’s scholar in residence, and £10 for each day Queen’s scholar en- 
-..,. rolled, for continuous training throughout the year for which it is being paid. 
A Q In day training colleges a grant will be made annually through the local committee 
of £25 to each male, and of £20 to each female Queen's scholar, and a grant of £10 
tothe committee in respect. of each Queen’s scholar enrolled for continuous training 
Hes - throughout the year. * 
    Financial view of residential training colleges.—The original cost of 
; -the buildings belonging to the residential training colleges is $1,987,- 
| -- 350. Of this amount 30 per cent. was granted by the Government. 
The total expenditure for these colleges in 1889 was $850,179, of which 
the Government furnished 69 per cent., the fees of students 13.44 per 
cent.; the balance was derived from property and subscriptions. The 
average annual cost per student in the colleges for men is £59 17s, or 
fe $300. Of this 37 per cent. is applied to instruction, 49 per cent. to 
board, and. the balance to permanent establishment charges. The ayer- 
age annual cost per student in the colleges for women is £48 10s, or 
© $240.50, the distribution being 51 per cent. for instruction, 37 per cent. 
for board, and the balance for permanent establishment charges. 
Attendance and staff.—Te residential colleges are 43 in number, 4. é., 
‘17 for men, 25 for women, and 1 for both men and women. Thirty-six 
of these schools were established before the passage of the education 
- act. They have accommodation for 3,353 students, and in February, 
1890, had an attendance of 3,294, of whom all but 9 were Queen’s 
; scholars. 
_* The teachers’ force comprised 362 persons. 
        RECAPITULATION OF PRINCIPAL POINTS, 
_ The principal characteristics of the system of elementary education 
here briefly outlined are seen to be: The union of public and private 
agencies in the control and maintenance of schools; a limited obliga- 
tory curriculum, rigidly enforeed and tested; a comparatively wide 
_Tange of optional subjects; government aid and supervision, exercised ~ 
exclusively in respect to secular instruction, whether given in board or 
: voluntary schools ; denominational schools strengthened by their re- 
= lation to the government; teachers dependent upon local authorities for 
appointment and salary, but their qualifications prescribed, and their 
work tested by government; the employment of pupil-teachers, and 
the peculiar mode of distributing the government grant generally known 
as “payment upon results.” i

From the ‘sevetdien standpoint, the ay et would appear to involve 
many conflicting and irreconcilable elements, Experience has indeed | 
proved this to be the case. The friction resulting from the conflict 
between these opposing elements became so disturbing that a royal 
commission was appointed in 1886 to investigate the operations of the 
’ system, and report upon the same as a preliminary step toward remedial 
measures, 
The final report of the commissioners was submitted in 1888, The 
code issued by the department in 1890 is in certain respects the out- 
come of their recommendation. .This code provides, as we have seen, 
for a diminution in the pressure of examinations, allows greater free- 
dom to teachers in respect to the classification of their pupils, gives a 
fixed character to the greater portion of the grant, and marks the 
beginning of an important movement affecting the training and profes- 
sional prospects of teachers. 
Meanwhile the demand for a radical change in the system, looking to 
the establishment of a uniform system of board schools, has gathered 
such strength that a parliamentary act giving effect to this proposition 
is confidently anticipated even by its opponents. 
Schools for special classes.—The Government as yet has made no pro- 
vision for the education of the'deaf-mute or the blind, beyond author- 
izing the guardians of the poor in parishes and unions to pay for the } 
education of such children in certified schools, if their parents are unable 
to do so; similar authority is given to the guardians in respect to feeble- 
minded children. The blind and the deaf-mute are received in board 
schools, special classes being generally provided for them. Many 
private institutions have also been established for these classes, and 
a bill is now before Parliament looking to general ee SEatone provision 
in their behalf. 
By an act of 1866, ‘industrial schools” oes establish ed for the 
detention, training, and reformation of vicious or unmanageable chil- 
dren. The education act of 1870 authorized school boards to send truant 
and refractory children to these schools under specified conditions. 
School boards were also authorized to establish and maintain indus- 
trial schools for the same purposes. 
By the act of 1876, school boards were permitted to establish “ day ; 
industrial schools,” in which industrial training, elementary education, 
and one or more meals aday, but not lodging, are provided for the chil- 
dren. According to areport published in April, 1889, fourteen such day 
schools had been established in England, of which all but one were 
under school boards. : 
Many boards have also established truant. schools, where children 
may be brought under different training and discipline from those of 
the ordinary schools. 
‘Auailiary institutions.—The list of societies and associations whose 
work is in some way related to the elementary school work is well

nigh inexhaustible. In addition to the religious societies that maintain 
elementary schools, the following societies promote the interests of ele- 
mentary education in various ways: 
The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, founded in 1698, 
‘seeks by examinations, prizes, etc., to excite interest in scriptural 
study. 
The Recreative Evening Schools Association, which, as its name indi- 
cates, endeavors to introduce stimulating and popular exercises, such as 
' stereoscopic exhibitions, illustrated lectures, games, etc., into evening 
schools. . 
The Art for Schools Association, whose purpose it is to soften and ele-— 
vate the young by the influence of pictures and other objects of beauty 
in the school rooms. 
The Society for the Promotion of Physical Education is doing great 
_ service; the Physical Elementary Schools Bill introduced into Parlia- 
ment during the session of 1890 is largely due to its efforts. 
The Band of Hope Union, which sends temperance lecturers supplied 
with illustrative apparatus into the schools. 
The Yorkshire Ladies Council of Education works in various ways 
for the promotion of popular education. It has been specially active 
in developing instruction in cookery and domestic economy. 
_ The London Schools’ Dinners Association endeavors to provide one 
meal a day for the poorest class of school children. Its expenses in 
severe seasons run up to $500 a week. 
The National Association for the Promotion of Teachers of Technical 
and Secondary Education exercises an important influence upon legis- 
lation affecting elementary schools. 
The London Young Women’s Christian Association interests itself in 
maintaining evening-classes for girls. 
The Teachers’ University Association promotes relations between 
elementary teachers and universities, 
THE SOCIETIES FORMED BY TEACHERS AND OFFICERS, 
The National Union of Elementary Teachers is one of the largest 
societies of the kind in the world; it numbers about 16,000 members, is 
well officered, and thoroughly organized; it maintains an orphanage 
for the children of deceased members, a fund for the legal assistance of 
teachers who are unjustly dismissed or subjects of suits in court; a 
teachers’ benevolent fund, and a teachers’ provident society. 
The Union advocates Parliamentary representation of elementary 
teachers and the establishment of a superannuation fund. 
The organ of the Union is the Schoolmaster, an “educational news- 
paper, review, and school board record.” The English Teacher, a 
monthly publication, is also issued. , 
The annual meetings of the Union are largely attended and ably man- 
aged. Valuable papers are presented on topics previously assigned ; 
the discussions are full, spirited, and suggestive.
-P-A-G-E-179
  EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF ENGLAND. == 109 
: The school board clerks are also organized into an association which 
holds annual meetings for the discussion of school management and 
educational progress and demands. An immense amount of practical 
experience is here brought to bear upon the consideration of these sub- 
jects, and the reports of the conferences are exceedingly valuable for 
the light they throw upon the problems of school administration and 
many related problems. 
The university movements for promoting popular education are not 
without direct. effect upon the elementary schools; many of their pu- 
pils have won distinction at the university local examinations. 
Summer schools for elementary teachers have been held both at Ox- 
ford and’ Cambridge, and above all, the University Settlement, Toynbee 
Hall, East London, has sent a vivifying influence into the elementary 
school work of that swarming hive of humanity. 
Toynbee Hall residents have carried a joyous and animating spirit 
into the night schools; they have relieved the tedious drudgery of the — 
pupil teachers’ cram, and developed an esprit de corps. among those 
overworked youths by the formation of boating, cricket clubs, and the 
like. On the other hand, the residents have found in the machinery of 
the public schools a ready instrumentality for the promotion of their 
work of love and helpfulness among poor and outcast children,

Civil divisions.—For purposes of civil government France is divided into eighty-six 
departments, each having its local legislative assembly which is formed by election. 
The departments are subdivided into arrondissements, and these into cantons. The 
smallest civil divisions comprised within the cantons are communes, 
The chief executive officer of a department is the préfet. He is the intermediary 
between the central power and officials of all orders within the limits of his depart- 
ment. The arrondissements are simply administrative divisions, A canton is a 
district entitled to one representative in the departmental council. A commmnne 
is a district having an elective local council presided over by a mayor appointed by 
the government. Paris forms an exception, having a special form of local govern- 
ment. In 1886, the total number of communes was 36,121. They were classified

  THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF ‘FRANCE.. 
GENERAL VIEW OF THE SYSTEM. 
It would be difficult to convey an idea of the present educational sys- 
tem of France without reference to the Imperial University established 
by Napoleon in 1808. From this organization the system derives mugh 
of its external form and many of its constituent parts. Napoleon gave 
to the university the monopoly of education. It was the “state teach- 
ing.” This monopoly was gradually relinquished after the fall of 
the Emperor, and since the passage of the educational law of March 
15, 1850, the word university has not been employed as the legal 
designation of the organized system of public education. In common 
language, however, the system is still often called ‘ the university.” 
The agencies for public education and the official machinery by which 
_ their operations are regulated form at present a great department of» 
publie affairs under the control of a cabinet officer, the minister of 
public instruction and fine arts,? an‘office created August 26, 1824. The 
department comprises an administrative section, three scholastic. sec- 
tions, i. ¢., primary, secondary, and supericr, and a section of fine arts. 
The last has the oversight of public art schools, museums, publie¢ build- 
ings, ete. The minister of public instruction also shares with other 
ministers authority over a number of special schools of art or technol- 
ogy. For example, over the Polytechnic School (Boole polytechnique), 
with the minister of war; the Superior School of Mines (Ecole supérieure 
des mines), with the minister of public works, and the famous School of 
Arts and Manufactures (Heole centrale des arts et manufactures), with 
the minister of commerce, of industry, and of colonies. 
The jurisdiction of the minister is not confined to institutions main- 
‘tained by the state, but extends in a measure to private schools and to 
the special schools maintained by municipalities, trade guilds, ete. 
These last form a very interesting feature of the educational provision of 
‘the country. Paris is especially liberal in this respect, maintaining a 
great number of commercial and industrial art and science schools, 
where after the labors of the day artisans pursue the study of special 
subjects relating to their vocation. Among provincial cities, Lyons, 
Toulouse, and Limoges are particularly rich in such provision.’ 
There are also municipal schools for higher departments of knowledge, 
the most important of whichis the Free School of Political Science 
(Beole libre des sciences politiques), maintained at Paris since 1872. 
To the department of the minister of public instruction and fine   
1§ee in this connection circular addressed by Jules Ferry to superior council,

?The incumbent of the office at the present time (February, 1839) is Léon Boas 
geois; the minister whose name was signed to the latest official peper ts, viz, for 1886-87 
and 1887-88, was A. Falliéres.

ae ‘elon g also the great astronomic and. me OeplNBIG bureaus main- 
tained by the State. 
The minister controls the operations of the system throden a series 
of officials belonging either to the central administration or to local ad- 
nifhistrative districts. 
A. CENTRAL ADMINISTRA'TION, 
The central administration includes the cabinet of the minister, a 
. general director and assistant bureaus, whose duties relate to the sec- 
retaryships and accounts of the service; a general director for each of 
the three scholastie divisions, for the cecdicn of fine arts,.and for the 
oversight of public buildings. 
General inspectors are also appointed to supervise the operations of 
the system throughout the country. 
- The inspection of primary instruction is confided to six of these 
officials. Three other general inspectors are charged, one with the su- 
pervision of the internal conduct of normal schools, and national pro- 
fessional, i. ¢., technical and trade schools; a second, with the supervision 
of manual tenis in normal schools; and the third, with the super- 
- vision of gymnastics and military aula in the various classes of primary 
schools. The inspection of instruction in music, vocaland instrumental, 
of living languages, and of design in the normal schools and in the 
superior primary schools is confided to special inspec tors. There are 
also four general inspectresses of infant schools. ‘ 
These officials are the direct representatives of the minister, conduct- 
jng their investigations in the portion of the country assigned to them 
according to his express direction, and reporting to him. The office 
of general inspector dates from the formation of the Imperial Uni- 
‘versity, 1808, The service was extended to primary instruction in 
' 1846, events having proved the weakness: of a system wanting this 
provision.! 
B. ACADEMIC AND DEPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION. 
1. For purposes of educational administration, France is divided into 
sixteen districts (or including Algiers, seventeen), termed académies. 
Each académie comprises all the schools, colleges, and facultés i. e., 
groups of “university” professors for superior instruction, within its 
‘bounds. It is in fact a scholastic organization, in which there is a 
graded series of teaching bodies or institutions. At the head is the rec- 
tor, who has control of the three orders of instruction, but particularly 
of secondary and superior instruction. He is assisted by an academic 
council. The rectors superintend the higher and secondary schools,

oversee the private schools, and control the primary schools. They con 
voke the facultés in their respective districts to devise courses of study, 
which are transmitted to the minister with the views of the rectors. — 
(In the académie of Paris the nominal rector is the minister pine? By 
is represented by a vice-rector.) 
2. The eighty-six departments of France form subordinate districts 
for educational administration within the académies, 
In the chief city of each department resides an academic inspector, 
inspecteur dacadémie, who is charged under the orders of the rector 
with the supervision of secondary instruction, and who shares with the 
prefect of the department the direction of primary instruction. The | 
academic inspector and the it are assisted by a Aeparunenaal jean 
council. 
At Paris, at Marseilles, and at Lille an academic inspector is exclu- 
sively charged with the service of primary instruction under the title 
of director of primary instruction of the department. 
‘At the majority of the chief towns of each departmental division and 
the chief places in many cantons, there are resident primary inspectors 
charged under the orders of the ebdaiie inspector with the direction 
and the control of primary instruction. 
The division into académies was made by Napoleon, who. purposed 
forming as many of these districts as there were lower courts, “courts 
of appeal.” The articulation of departments and minor divisions and © 
the graded series of officials are also derived from the Imperial Uni- 
_ versity. 
\ 2 THE COUNCILS. 
The councils belonging to the central administration—The minister is 
assisted by an advisory council (comité consultatif) formed by his own 
appointment from the company of general inspectors, honorary or acting, 
and from the highest officials pertaining to the three scholastic orders. 
This committee gives advice upon matters submitted by the minister. 
Traces of it appear to be found as early as 1804. Its formal constitution | 
dates from a decree issued March 25, 1873, by Jules Simon, at that time 
minister of public instruction. It was organized in its present form by 
decree of May 11, 1880. 
The Superior Council of Public Instruction is the great deliberative 
head of the educational organization. It is composed of sixty members, 
three-fourths of whom are chosen by their peers from the three orders 
of instruction, the remaining number being appointed by the Presi- 
dent of the Republic upon the advice of the minister. The term of serv- 
ice is four years, with opportunity for reélection. The council is emi- 
-nently a representative body, even women who are inspectresses of 
infant, schools or directresses of normal schools being eligible to mem- 
bership. 
Nine of the members appointed by the President and six elected mem- — 
bers constitute a permanent section, which meets every week; the en-

tire council holds two annual sessions, one in July, the other in De- 
eember. : ES 3 
The permanent section deliberates upon matters which are to be sub-- 
mitted to the general council, and offers its advice upon the same. 
Tse matters relate to programmes and regulations for all classes of 
schools, the creation of university courses or facultés, of lycées, and of 
normal schools, the multiplication of chairs, text-books, and, in short, 
to all questions pertaining to studies, administration, discipline, and 
standards, which may be submitted by the minister. These questions 
are eventually deliberated in the general council, which prescribes the 
course of instruction in all public schools and determines the conditions 
under which private schools may be opened. 
The council is also a final court of appeal from judgments rendered 
by the academic or departmental councils in certain cases of discipline 
or contention. The minister presides over the deliberations of the 
council. 
_ This body resembles the council of the Imperial University. It is a 
survival, preserved under various forms since the fall of Napoleon. Its 
spirit has, however, been completely changed by its transformation into 
an elective body. Created as an instrument of arbitrary power, the 
eouncil has become a safeguard against it. i 
Academic and departmental councils.—In each académie there is a 
* council presided over by the rector and composed of members chosen 
for the most part by. their peers, and representing the two higher or- 
ders of instruction, to whose interests the deliberations of the council 
are confined. 
Finally, in each department there is a council of primary instruction 
composed of members of the superior council and primary school direct- 
" ors, under the presidency of the prefect, which deliberates, advises, and — 
_ renders judgment in certain matters pertaining to primary schools.! 
The administrative and supervisory service of the system, it is seen, 
emanates from the State, there being no independent local responsi- 
pility and supervision such as we are familiar with in this country. 
The councils are indeed representative bodies, but not representative 
of the people; while the election of teachers and professors by their peers 
to serve in these assemblies is a great advance over Napoleon’s policy 
of arbitrary appointments, it is widely removed from the policy of local 
initiative and local control which is more or less active in the school 
systems of all Anglo-Saxon peoples. 
TENDENCIES OF CENTRALIZATION. 
The tendency of this centralized system is toward uniformity in the 
‘constitution and operations of establishments belonging to the same 
scholastic department. This uniformity is absolute in respect to those

parts of the service of which the State assumes the entire control, as 
the maintenance of the teaching force, the composition of courses of _ , ee 
Study, ete. With respect to other features, although the regulations 
are the. same for all similar institutions, their application is constantly 
‘modified by local conditions and by ineradicable tendencies which m 
fest themselves particularly i in the development of institutions of tha 
highest order. For this reason it is only the operations of the primary 
department of the system that can be fairly exhibited in a view which 
is necessarily limited to general provisions. 
\ 
‘ORIGIN OF THE SCHOLASTIC INSTITUTIONS OF FRANCE. 
Two distinct systems of institutions, distinct as regards their origin, 
Scholastic attributes, and present relations to the state, are comprised 
within the department of public instruction: (1) Primary schools, which 
belong to the modern era and which are largely the work of the present 
Republic, bearing no resemblance to and being in no sense ‘a develop- 
ment from the parochial schools existing before the revolution of 1789 ; 
and (2) secondary and superior institutions, whose history can be fag 
to the Middle Ages. 
In 1833 a law, known as Guizot’s law, imposed upon the communes 
the obligation of establishing primary schools. The general execution 
of this law was hindered by the lack of schoolhouses, the apathy of the 
_ People, and the absence of effective supervision. Some progress, how- 
ever, was made until the work was interrupted by the revolution of 1848. 
Between that time and the establishment of the present government 
(1870) efforts were made to revive the policy, but with few practical 
results. Before undertaking to enforce the law in this respect the pres- 
‘ent Republic made the necessary provision for schoolhouses. A law 
of June 1, 1878, created a fund of $23,000,000 for this purpose, and the 
work of peas began in earnest. This, with an effective supervision, 
has proved sufficient to secure the enforcement of the law obliging com- 
munes to establish schools. In 1886-87, 35,980 communes had _per- 
formed this duty, 67 had only private Rokasis and 87 were without 
schools. By the law of June 16, 1881, instruction in public primary 
schools was made gratuitous, and by another law of the same date pri- 
mary teachers were required to be provided with state diplomas (br'e- 
vets de capacité). This did away.’ with the letters of authorization from 
ecclesiastics, and began in earnest the effort to make the schools 
thoroughly national in spirit and in purpose. . A law of March 28, 1882, 
made attendance upon public primary schools compulsory for all chil. 
dren not otherwise instructed and confined. the instruction to secular 
branclies. The organization was completed by the law of October 30, 
1886, which prescribed minutely all the details of the service of inspec- 
tion, of teaching, attendance, ete. The most important provision of 
. this law, so far as immediate effects are concerned, was that requiring 
teachers to belong to the laity. Five years were ailawed for the fall '

The principles involved in this besakenit i. e., compulsion, qiaeuitdud : 
secular instruction, and a teaching service owing sole allegiance to 
th state, must be tested by its operations, ‘which are considered in de- 
tail in the following pages: 
Public secondary schools are of two ved enlentehl schools tase 
, established by the state, and)communal schools (colléges communatx) 
established by the communes assisted by the State. d 
These schools haye replaced the old ecclesiastical and university col 
leges existing before the revolution of 1789. They preserve now very 
' nearly the organization given to them by Napoleon. 
The state maintains for superior instruction facultés comprising : 
groups of professional men for the service of liberal and professional 
education. These groups have replaced the ancient universities. 
The general operations of this complex system for 1887-88 are indi- | 
pared by the following statistics : '

    ENROLLMENT AND ATTENDANCE. By 
  “The number of pupils enrolled in the primary schools, as shown in the oe 
foregoing table, is equivalent to 16 per cent. of the total population. 
Of the total enrollment 75 per cent. were between the obligatory ages, :

4. €., Six to thirteen. They represented 93. per cent. of the honainiee : 
between those ages. These figures are, however, misleading, since the — 
enrollment includes all names found upon the school registers, not ex- 
cluding duplicates. } 
For the purpose of estimating more exactly, the ratio of the attend- 
ance of pupils in the public primary schools to the enrollment in those 
schools a special enumeration was made of all the pupils present De- 
cember 4, 1886, the season of largest attendance upon the schools, and 
the 4th of June, 1887, the season when attendance falls to the minimum. 
The number present at the former date was 3,508,409, being 91 per cent. 
of the number borne on the registers for that month, and 79 per cent. 
of the total enrollment for the year. The number present at the later 
enumeration (June 4, 1887), was 3,216,739, or 88 per cent. of the number 
borne on the registers for the month of June, and 72 per cent. of the — 
annual enrollment.! ; 
Comparison with 1881-82.—From a comparison of the statistics of 
1881-82 with those of 1886-87, it appears that the population of school 
age in France (six to thirteen) increased during the five years by 3.1 per 
cent., while the number of children between those ages enrolled in the 
schools inereased by 6.5 per cent. 
During the same time, the enrolment of children under 6 years of 
age increased by 2.1 per cent., while the enrolment of children above 3 
13 years of age diminished fee 4.7 per cent. 
The number of boys in secondary instruction averages one for every 
239 inhabitants, or if we include the students of primary and sec- a a 
ondary normal schools for men, 1 for every 231 inhabitants. In the | 
absence of statistics respecting private secondary establishments for 
girls, comparison here is not possible. : 
The attendance upon university courses and the superior normal 
school averages 1 student for every 2,104 inhabitants. 
FINANCES. 
INCOME. ‘ ‘ 
The income of the state system is derived from state and local appro- 
priations, tuition fees, the property of institutions, gifts, and legacies. 
Local appropmations are communal or departmental. 
The state appropriates annually a sufficient sum to meet the caeeae 
expenditures of the system; the amounts derived for that purpose 
from the departments and the communes, and the receipts. from fees 
either for tuition or board, are placed to the credit of the state. : 
The tax levied upon the communes for the current expenditure of ~ 
primary education was fixed by the law of July 14, 1889, at 8.12 per’

EXPENDITURES, 
   - Primary schools—The expenditures for primary schools are divided 
‘into three classes, obligatory, optional, and divers. The obligatory ex- 
penditures are current and extraordinary. Whe latter are for the pur- 
chase of sites and the construction of buildings. The following table 
shows the amount of the current expenditures in 1886-87, with the pro- 
portional part borne by each contributing source.

The obligatory expenditure, column 2 of the above table, includes 
the costs of administration and of the primary normal schools; omit- 
ting these, the amount would be $22,366,280, which was furnished as 
follows:

        The marked diminution in the proportional part borne by the depart- 
ments is due to the fact that by far the largest share of the expense for 
normal schools falls upon.them. 
The largest item in this expenditure was teachers’ salaries, which 
amounted to 93 per cent. of the total obligatory expenditure and to 60 
per cent, of the grand total. 
Divers expenditures, column 7, include the costs of adult courses, 
funds for aiding teachers, scholarships for worthy pupils, library funds, 
ete. 
Comparisons with 1881-82.— As compared with 1881-82 the statisties 
show an increase of 16 per cent. in the ordinary obligatory expenditures” 
on account of the public primary schools, and of 30 per cent. in the 
grand total of expenditure. 
Comparisons based upon the total expenditures at the two dates are 
misleading, as prior to 1885 no account was kept of the funds contributed 
by the communes for divers expenses. Omitting this element _alto- 
gether, the part borne by each contributing source at the two dates,

Extraordinary expenditures.—The current expenditure does not repre- 
sent the whole effort put forth by the state for the maintenance of pri- 
mary education. ‘ 
The extraordinary expenditures which pertain to the construction and 
repair of schoolhouses and the supply of school material have yet to 
be considered. 
The law imposes upon the communes the duty of providing and main- 
taining suitable school buildings and premises. Communes having no 
funds available for the purpose must secure a loan from the state. 
Under the law of June 20, 1885, this advance takes the form of an an- 
nual sum equal to one-fourth of the principal and interest of the sum — 
borrowed by the commune. The advances are repayable in 30 years at 
the least, and in 40 years at the most. 
The entire expenditure for the construction of school-houses from , 
1878 to December 31, 1887, was $101,824,185. Of this sum 86.63 per 
cent. was paid prior to 1885; 13.37 per cent. from 1885 to 1887, inclu- 
sive. 
The sum was derived as follows: 
   
  Communes ..

    Secondary schools.—The material in hand does not permit a detailed 
view of the expenditures for secondary schools. i 
The total receipts for the public secondary schools, i: ¢., for boys and 
girls, amounted in 1887 to $10,406,443, of which about 36 per cent. was 
derived from public funds. The sources of income for the different 
classes of institutions differ so widely, that a general summary of ~ 
finances is misleading. The following analysis shows the composition 
and distribution of the annual income of every class of Sabon an

It should also be observed that since 1877 aboye $23,000,000 have 
been expended i in buildings and equipments, of which the site bore 56 - 
‘per cent., and the cities which are the seats of the facultés the balance. 
The itive public expenditure for education in 1887 was about 
$40, 000,000, of which 86 per cent. was for primary instruction. 
_ QUALIFICATIONS, APPOINTMENTS, AND DISCIPLINE OF TEACHERS OF 
4 PUBLIC pe SCHOOLS. 
The teaching service of primary instruction is regulated in the main 
by the laws of October 30, 1886, and of July 19, 1889. 
The ‘qualifications for the service, as determined by the former law, 
are as follows: 
Nationality and age.—Teachers must be French citizens; if men, must 
‘be at least eighteen years of age, and if women, at least seventeen. A 
director of a school must be at least twenty-one years of age. No one 
under twenty-five years of age can be a director of a superior primary 
school or of a school which hasa boarding department. Directors and 
directresses of normal schools must be at least thirty years of age. 
Attainments, character, ete.—In accordance with the law of June 16, 
1881, teachers must be provided with state diplomas (brevets de capacite). 
‘There are two grades of diplomas for teachers of elementary primary 
schools (brevet élémentaire and brevet supérieur). Candidates are exam- 
ined by boards (commissions @cxamen) which are composed of members 
appointed by the academic rectors. No one can be examined for the 
higher diploma who has net secured the lower. There are also diplo- 
mas (brevets de capacité) for teachers of superior, primary schools, nor- 
mal schools, and for teachers of special branches in these. 
No one who has been condemned in the courts for crime or immorality 
is eligible to the service, 
By the law of October 30, 1886, all administrative functions and all 
commercial and industrial pursuits‘are forbidden to public school teach- 
ers, and they must be drawn exclusively from the laity. Time was 
alowed for carrying out this last provision, and also for ATONE, 
teachers not provided with diplomas. 
The situation with respect to these requirements in the public schools 
in 1881-82, Bt again in Aah Ot was as follows:

schools are full (titwlaires), or probationers (stagiaires), the latter form- 
ing about 20 per cent. of the effective force. The titulaires are ap- 
pointed by the prefects. Great dissatisfaction has been manifested 
with this provision; and as a consequence the power of the prefects 
was modified by the law of October 30, 1886, which required them to 
select teachers from lists of candidates pyunaied by the departmental 
councils; the stagiaires receive their appointments: from the academic 
inspector. 
The penalties to which teachers are subject are reprimand, censure, 
reduction in position, suspension, removal, and absolute dismissal from 
the service. These penalties are inflicted py the academic inspector or — 
by the prefect, the teacher having the right of appeal to the minister 
or to the supreme council. og 
Salaries.—The law of July 19, 1839, rerulating the salaries of teachers 
abrogates the law passed just forty years previous. Under the present 
law the state becomes responsible for all salaries, and the rates of com- 
pensation have been somewhat increased. Principal teachers are di- 
vided into three groups, viz, elementary, superior primary, and normal; 
each group is divided into five classes, with annual salaries fixed as — 
follows: ; f 
  .| Superior | Normal schools. ——"| primary

» First class 320 560 | 1,100 1, 000 
    
    
An additional sum of $40 is allowed principals in charge of a school. 
of three or four classes, and of $80 for a school of more than four classes. - 
Promotion from one grade of salary to the next may be made with- 
out a change of place; it depends upon the length and efficiency of 
service and can only take place when there is a vacancy. Moreover, 
teachers of the fifth and fourth classes can not be promoted to a supe- 
rior class until after five years’ service in the inferior position; no | 
‘teacher is eligible to the second or first class who is not provided with 
the highest certificate (brevet supériewr) and who has not served at. 
least three years in the class preceding. It is, however, expressly 
provided that so far as length of service affects promotion, teachers 
haying served ten years may be placed in the fifth class; fifteen years, | 
-in the fourth class ; twenty years, in the third ; and pe five years, 
  in the second. ; 
Assistant teachers in primary schools are paid $160. Assistant eae 
teachers in superior primary schools, from $220 to $420. 
In addition to his salary, every teacher must be provided with a resi-

dence or with a money equivalent for the same. The law imposes this 
provision upon the communes, and fixes the rates of indemnity for 
residences for teachers in charge of a school having more than two 
classes, or having a class of the superior ba grade, as follows: 
In localities where the population is from--

The indemnity for residences allowed all other regular teachers is 
~ one-half the above sums, and for probationers one-fourth. ; 
Communes of less than 1,000 inhabitants, which are-the chief places 
of their respective cantons, pay the same indemnity as those of 1,000. 
_ Pensions, etec.—The law of June 9, 1853, extending the civil pension 
list to include teachers, still remains in force; teachers who are pledged 
to give ten years’ service in the public sanomls are relieved from mili- 
tary service in time of peace. 
PROVISION FOR TRAINING. 
Provision for the training of teachers is a promivent feature of the 
French system of education. 
_ For the service of primary instruction the state maintains two supe- 
rior normal schools, one at St. Cloud, designed to prepare professors for 
the primary normal schools for men, and a corresponding school for 
women at Fontenay-aux-Roses; also the normal school Pape-Carpantier 
at Versailles for the training of directresses of infant schools. 
Moreover every departinent is obliged by law to maintain at least 
two normal schools, one for the training of masters and the other for 
mistresses of primary schools. With a single exception, every depart- 
ment has established one or more normal schools for masters; the total 
number in 1887-88 being 90, with an enrollmént of 5,443 pupils, and 
1,709 graduates at the close of the year. The normal schools for mis-: 
tresses number 81, with 3,544 students in 1887-88 and 1,118 graduates. 
PROFESSORS OF SECONDARY AND SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
Qualifications and appointment.—The professors of secondary and of 
superior instruction belong alike to the professional corps of the wni- 
versité, differing from each other for the time being by virtue of the — 
rank which they have achieved. i 
Their classification and designation illustrate the precision of the 
official grading and at the same time suggest successive steps in the

historic development of the service. Two titles, professor and agrégé, 
are common to secondary and superior institutions. <Agrégés, as the 
word indicates, have been added to the professional body as originally 
instituted, for reasons that will appear hereafter. While bearing the ~ 
same titles, professors and agrégés of secondary instruction do not rank 
as high in the wniversité as the corresponding members of the facultés 
either in respect to salaries or to scholastic recognition. 
Professors of the lycées are full (¢. ¢., titulatres) or divisional, the latter 
being in charge of a division of a class. 
A professor must. have a university degree; for the lycées, at least 
the bachelor’s degree. A professor in a faculté must have the doctors 
degree of that order. The title agrégé does not, like a degree, indicate 
the completion of a course of study, but the mastery of a particular 
branch; thus there are agrégés in philosophy, history, mathematics, lit- 
erature, chemistry, anatomy, and physiology. 
Candidates for the agrégation must have the doctor's degree, and 
must pass a competitive examination, the nature of which is determined 
by the class of agrégation to which they aspire. The agrégés rank im- 
mediately after the full professors; they may assist in examinations 
conducted by the professors and may replace them in their absence. 
No person is eligible to this position unless he is twenty-five years of age. 
The minister can authorize the agrégés, on recommendation of the dean 
of a faculté, supported by the rector of the académie, to open comple- 
mentary courses; that is, private courses, additional to the regular 
courses in the locality of the faculté to which they belong. 
The agrégés are the only class of assistants included in the facultés of 
law and of medicine. The facultés of science and of letters include also 
assistants termed chargés de cours, and instructors who are called mattres 
de conférences.. The last named class of assistants was instituted by a _ 
decree of 1877. They are intended to supplement the lessons of the 
professors by instruction of a far more detailed and personal character, 
conducted by means of questions and explanations after the manner of 
recitations in American colleges. : 
These instructors are appointed by the minister for one year, but 
their appointments can be indefinitely renewed. In addition to pro- 
fessors and agrégés the teaching force of the lycées includes assistants 
assigned to special duties and tutors called mattres répétiteurs. 
~ Professors of lycées are appointed by the Minister of Public Instrue- 
tion. Mattres répétiteurs of the lycées and certain professors in the 
communal secondary schools are appointed by the minister upon the 
recommendation of academic rectors. 
Full professors of the facultés are appointed by the President of the 
Republic upon the proposition of the minister of public instruction, 
who makes his choice from two lists, one presented by the council of 
the faculté in which the vacancy occurs, and the other by the perma- 
nent section of the superior council.

COURSES OF STUDY. 
Primary schools—The course of study for primary schools prescribed 
by the law of March 28, 1882, comprises the following branches: Moral 
and civic instruction, reading, writing, the elements of arithmetic and 
the metric system, history and geography, especially of France; object, 
lessons, and the first notions of science, elements of design, of singing, 
manual work (needlework in the schools for girls), gymnastic exercises, 
and in the schools for boys military drill. 
In the superior primary schools these branches of instruction are re- 
viewed and more fully developed. The course is extended to include — 
algebra and geometry; natural science and physics, and their applica- 
tions to agriculture, to industrial arts and to hygiene; political economy, 
French language and literature, general history, industrial and com- 
mercial geography, iron and wood work for boys, and cutting and fit- 
ting for girls. One foreign language is also included. Additional 
courses pertaining to local industries may be authorized by the min- In the superior school of pharmacy the professors. ‘of the first class i 
ister upon the demand of local committees supported by the academic 
inspector and approved by the departmental council. 
Normal schools.—In the primary (i. ¢., departmental) normal schools, 
the studies of the primary course are reviewed with reference to meth- 
ods of instruction, and at the same time developed to include the full 
scope and scholastic bearing of those subjects. Pedagogy and school 
administration are treated both theoretically and practically. In the 
division of the day, eight hours are allowed for sleep and about five for ~ 
eating, recreation, toilet, etc. Of the hours reserved for scholastic 
duties five at least are to be devoted to the preparation of studies, ex- 
ercises, and to practical work. The hours of instruction in each week 
do not exceed twenty-five in the schools for men and twenty-two in the 
schools for women. Of this time, in both normal schools for men and 
for women, five hours a week are given to literary instruction the first 
year, three hours the second, and two the third year. The rest of the 
time is devoted to the instruction in science and in design. 
Instruction in the following subjectsis given outside the regular class 
hours: in the normal schools for men, agricultural and manual work, 
military and gymnastic exercises, vocal and instrumental music; in the.    
-P-A-G-E-198
  MOB Z g "EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-80, 
  normal schools for women, needle- work, housework and gardening, gym- 
“nasties, and vocal and instrumental music. The course of study in 
these schools covers three years. An entrance examination is required, 
to which no one is admitted who has not obtained the lowest grade 
teacher's certificate (brevet élémentaire). Upon the completion of the 
course, students must present themselves for the examination for the 
higher grade certificate (brevet supérieur). 
Secondary courses.'—Courses of secondary study are of three general 
classes. The full classical course leading to the degree of bachelor of 
letters or bachelor of science, received its present form from the de- 
erees of March 24, 1865, and January 22, 1885. The other two are 
the course of special secondary instruction created by the law of July 
_ 21, 1865, which leads to the diploma of bachelor of special secondary 
instruction, and the course of secondary instruction for girls, as consti- 
tuted by the law of December 21, 1880, and subsequent ens 
: of the same.” 
  
1 This statement gives the composition of secondary courses up to August 8, 1890, 
On that day, a decree issued by the President of the Republic established a single 
bachelor’s degree in place of the degrees of Bachelor of Letters, Bachelor of Sciences, 
and limited degree of Bachelor of Sciences. As the courses of the lycées are intended 
to prepare students for the examinations leading to this degree, this change will nat- 
urally cause some modification in the plan of studies. 
2The prescribed studies for the two last classes of the classical course will suffice 
~ for comparison with typical courses in the United States. The following conspectus 
gives in an abridged form the official programme for the classes of rhetoric and phi- 
losophy, and for the special mathematical course which may be substituted for these 
~ classes or enterei the year preceding the stage of rhetoric.

course of three years, in which the studies are substantially those of 
the primary schools, with the addition of Latin and the exclusion of 
manual training. : 
The special secondary course, which is intended for students who con- 
templatea commercial or industrial career, covers six years, This course 
affords also the means of codrdination between primary and secondary 
instruction, pupils from the elementary primary schools being admitted 
and one Greek author. The two French authors are chosen each year from a list 
containing works of Descartes, Malebranche, Pascal, Leibnitz, Condillac, and Cou-

Courses of superior instruction—The composition of the courses of © 
superior instruction is determined by the purposes to which they are 
directed ; they are either general, that is for liberal culture; or special, 
that is designed to prepare students for law, medicine, engineering, 
professorships, etc. 
Side by side with the traditional university studies, these courses 
show large and constantly increasing development in pure and applied | 
science, in philosophy, and in political and social science. This increase — 
has been promoted by the creation of complementary courses and con- 
Férences, to which reference has already been made. The former, as the 
word indicates, provide for subjects not included in the titulary chairs, 
Thus, as M, Liard explains, “in a faculté where there is only one chair 
of philosophy, a course of the history of philosophy would be comple- 
mentary.” They afford opportunity for students to extend, their re- 
searches in particular lines under the guidance of specialists, while. 
the conférences serve to reiterate and enforce the subject-matter of the 
regular courses. 
ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF SCHOOLS. 
Classification and description of primary schools.—The department of 
primary instruction, as organized by the law of October 30, 1886, com- 
prises infant schools and classes, elementary primary schools, superior 
primary schools, and schools of manual apprenticeship. The line of ee 
separation between these different classes of schools and the division — 
among them of the prescribed subjects of primary instruction are de- 
termined by special regulations elaborated in the superior council of 
public instruction. All of these schools are free and secular, and the 
teachers must in all cases be appointed from the laity. The law with 
respect to compulsory attendance applies only to the elementary pri- 
mary schools. 
1. Infant schools (écoles maternelles) oe injant classes: In the infant 
schools, children of both sexes from two to six years of age receive 
together physical, moral, and intellectual training adapted to their — 
tender years. These schools are wholly in the charge of women; the 
teaching force includes a directress, and an assistant if the number of 
children is more than fifty. The teachers are always aided by a sewing . 
woman. 
 
-P-A-G-E-202
        
       132. “EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
. In every commune where a public maternal school exists, one or more 
committees of women are formed to keep watch over its sanitary and 
hygienic conditions, the general appearance of the establishment, and 
the disposition of funds or gifts, legacies, etc., received for the benefit 
of the children. The mayor presides over these committees. 
Communes are not obliged by law to found and maintain maternal 
schools, and it is only in communes having above 2,000 inhabitants, of. 
which at least 1,200 are concentrated in one locality, that these schools — 
are included in the number of public primary schools entitled to support + 
by the commune and to State subventions. These schools are better 
SS adapted to cities than to rural districts. A little more than10 per cent. 
of the communes report at least one infant school. 
"Infant classes are under similar regulations; they are but. annexes 
either to primary elementary or to infant schools, between which they 
form an intermediate degree. The usual agé of attendance is four to 
seven years. 
2. Theelementary primary schools are for the instruction of children 
from six to thirteen years of age, that is, the obligatory school period. 
In communes having neither infant schools nor infant classes, the age 
for admission to the elementary primary schools is lowered to five years; 
it is raised to seven where there is ‘an infant class, Children above thir- 
teen years of age can not be admitted to the elementary primaries with- 
out special permission. 
The elementary primary schools may be for boys only, in which case 
-the instruction is given by men; for girls only or mixed as to sex, in 
both of which cases the instruction is given by women. 
The master of a boys’ school may be assisted by his wife, sister, or 
mother; under certain circumstances the departmental council may «u- 
thorize a man to take charge of a mixed school, provided it has a mis- 
tress of sewing and cutting. : y 
_ Every commune must be provided with at least one public primary 
school. The departmental council, however, with the consent of the 
minister may authorize two or more communes to unite for the main- 
tenance of a school. When a commuue or a number of united com- 
munes have 50) inhabitants or more, they must provide a special school 
for girls, or in its place a mixed school, if the departmental council is 
agreed. The distribution of pupils among separate and mixed schools 
in 1887 was as follows:

ters of population remote from towns or separated from each other by . 
three kilometres and containing at least twenty children of school age. 
Of the 36,121 communes only 80, or 0.2 per cent., were without primary 
schools in 1886-87. 
3. Superior primary instruction is given either in superior primary 
schools or in “ complementary courses.” The establishment takes the 
latter name if it is annexed to an elementary primary school, and the 
former if it has a distinct location and is under a separate direction. 
The complementary courses comprise one or two years. . The superior 
primary schools may comprise two or more years, and must be provided 
with as many rooms as there are classes. They are called full-course 
' schools (écoles de plein ewercice) when they comprise at least three years’ 
study. 
As regards the character of the studies pursued, these schools belong 
to one of two classes, according as they have or have not provision for 
industrial or technical training. t 
Schools of the former class admit pupils who are provided with the 
certificate of primary studies. The latter are called professional 
schools. No pupils under 12 years of age are admitted to these, and 
applicants not provided with the certificate of primary studies must pass 
an entrance examination. In these schools, the greater part of the time 
is devoted to manual work and to scientific and technological instrue- 
tion with their commercial ard industrial applications. They are un- 
der the double authority of the minister of public instruction and the 
minister of commerce. Instruction is gratuitous in the superior primary 
schools; bursaries, or scholarships, are maintained in them by the State, 
by the departments, and by the communes respectively. 
4, The schools of manual apprenticeship are designed to develop 
in young people who are destined for manual pursuits the necessary ~ 
skill and technical knewledge. They differ from the professional 
schools described in the foregoing paragraph in this respect, that the 
technical training is directed to special industries forming a veritable 
apprenticeship, whereas in the former, the training is directed to the 
development of a taste for manual work, accuracy of the eye, manual 
dexterity, and practical ideas of divers orders, forming altogether a 
suitable preparation for apprenticeship to some particular art. 
The schools of manual apprenticeship are also under the double 
authority of the minister of public instruction and the minister of com- 
merce.

“schools,! but simply those superior primary schools which are under the 
sole charge of the minister of public instruction. Manual training, it 
should be obser ved, however, is a feature of these schools also. In 1887 
they numbered, including complementary courses, 559, of which 419 
were for boys, and 140 for girls. Of the total number, 539 were public 
‘schools. These enrolled 80 per cent. of the 38,441 pupils registered in 
this class of schools. <A large proportion of the students who pass 
through these schools enter at once upon some business career; many 
continue their studies in the government technical schools.

Secular vs. church schools.—The classification of the schools as secu- 
lar and church or denominational is important, since the relative num- 
bers serve as an index of the support which the government policy 
commands. The movement in this respect from 1881-82 to 1886-87 is 
shown by the following statistics :

It will be observed that the ratio of increase in private schools has 
been a little greater than in public schools, and that this increase in 
private schools has been wholly in those classed as religious. Nearly 
seven-tenths of this increase is made up of schools for girls. 
It is interesting to note, also, that the majority of schools having 
‘only one or two classes are secular. Schools having from three to seven’ 
classes are about evenly divided between the secular and religious, 
while the majority of the schools having more than seven. classes ate. 4 
religious. ‘The precise classification in this respect is as follows:

The increase of graded schools is indicated by the fact that whereas, 
* in 1881-82, there were 138 class rooms to every 100 public schools, in 
1886-87 the proportion stood 144 to 100. Of the schools with a single 
teacher, 485 had more than 80 children each, and in the schools with — 
two or more teachers, 273 class rooms had more than 80 children each. 
Buildings and grounds.—The state imposes upon the commune the 
obligation of providing suitable housing for primary schools. Thesize. — ~ 
and seating capacity of the schoolhouse depend upon the population 
of the locality, but the following requirements are of universal appli- 
cation. The site must be healthful, well drained, accessible, and of 
ample extent, The regulations call for from 8 to 10 square metres per 
scholar. While this basis is not always adopted, the surface dimen- 
  "y
-P-A-G-E-206
136° EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
sions of the smallest sites are rarely less than 500 square metres. The 
schoolhouse must have a general hall large enough for. assembling all 
the pupils, and class rooms according to requirements. The passage 
halls must be commodious, and suitable toilet rooms must be provided.t 
The ideal of the regulations is not realized in all the communes, but 
the work of building and improvement steadily progresses. Naturally, 
in France as in our own country, it is in the cities that the finest speci- 
mens of school architecture are to be found. The statistics of 1886-87 
- show a total of 60,518 schoolhouses, of which 47,147 belonged to com- 
munes, the remainder being rented or loaned. 
. The matter of lighting has received much attention and is still the 
‘subject of investigation and of experiment. Two systems of lighting 
are at present employed; the unilateral and the bilateral, the choice 
being determined by the size of rooms, Tor class rooms the minimum 
surface space is 1.25 metres per scholar, and the volume at least 3 metres 
per scholar. As a rule, these dimensions are exceeded. 
Various modes of seating have been tried, but preference is given to 
that of double desks arranged in rows with aisles between. 
The class room generally seats forty-eight or fifty, and has a platform: 
facing the pupils’ desks. There is also ‘space for a library, cabinets, 
ete. ‘ 
- Besides the schoolhouse proper, the grounds include a covered court 
which may be used as a gymnasium or for workshops, an open space 
for recreation, a garden, the teacher’s house, when this is supplied, 
and suitable outbuildings. 
School sessivns.—The school year begins in October and lasts eleven 
months for primary schools. Beside the vacation of a month, the 
schools are closed on certain days, festivals of the church and of the 
nation and the day immediately following each. The recognized holi- 
days are New Year’s, the last three days of Passion Week, and the na- 
tional féte days. ‘The law also allows local officers to grant two months’ 
extra vacation under special conditions, as for example necessity of 
farm work. The schools are in session five days in the week, Tharsday 
being a holiday. The school day is six hours, divided generally into 
two equal sessions with an intermission between. As a rule, each class 
  attends the entire day, but where it is desirable, arrangements for half — 
time attendance are allowed. 
Conduct of studies and discipline—The organization of the schools 
being determined, as we have seen, and, a vigorous supervision main- 
tained by the state, comparatively little freedom would seem to be left 
to teachers. This, however, is: not exactly the case. Relieved of ali 
responsibility with respect to extraneous matters, they are able to con- 
centrate tieir energies upon the work of instruction and discipline.

  THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF PRANCE. PANO 
The qualifications required for admission to the work are sufficient 
- to secure a body of efficient teachers, a large proportion of whom have 
been specially trained for the service. They evince great enthusiasm 
and professional skill, and but little tendency to mechanical methods, 
. the women especially being full of ingenuity. 
Instruction by observation, called in France méthode intuitive, has 
large development, and the teachers are aided in its use by the admira- 
ble collection of material with which nearly every school is supplied. 
The formation of school museums (musées scolaires) has been pro- 
moted chiefly by the efforts of M. F. Buisson, director of primary instrac- 
tion. His enthusiasm has proved contagious, and by the combined 
efforts of teachers, pupils, and parents, and the assistance of local funds, 
nearly 14,000 museums have been formed. 
Excellent discipline is maintained in the schools, the pupils being as 
a rule very tractable. Corporal punishment is strictly prohibited ; 
reprimands and suspensions are ordinary penalties, and final expulsion 
the extreme resort. 
Each scholar at the time of his entrance into a school receives a blank 
book, which he is expected to keep as long as he remains in school.! 
In this book he performs the first exercise of each month in each 
class of studies, a task to be done in school without help from others. 
The series of exercises show the course of instruction and the prog- 
ress of the scholar from year to year. This book is kept a the school 
and is known as the monthly record. 
At the beginning of the school year a time table is prepared by the 
teacher of each school, and after approval by the primary inspector, is. 
put up in the class rooms. 
Pupils are promoted annually. The certificate of primary studies is 
conferred upon those who complete the course and pass the required 
examination, to which, however, no one under eleven years of age is 
admitted. Attendance upon this examination is not obligatory. The 
“reports show, however, a steady increase in the number of candidates. 
In 1887 the number of certificates awarded was 144,046, as agaiust 
91,153 in 1882. 
Text-books and material.—Every year the teachers of each department 
meet together under the direction of the primary inspector to prepare 
a list of desirable text-books. These lists are revised by a special com- 
mission presided over by the academic inspector; the final list for 
each department is sabmitted to the approval of the academic rector. 
The multiplication of text-books has been a natural consequence of 
the development of the state system, and the number of books in the 
market shows a wholesome competition between rival publishers. 
The official list of approved text-books, made up to July, 1888, con- 
tains a total of 1,531 works. While many of these are poor, the list in-

eludes bose which are models of niials lucid composition: we logical 
arrangement, and stamped with the genius of some of the most distin- 
guished French authors.’ ‘ : 
French publishers have given great attention to maps and models of 
_ every kind, and the schools are abundantly supplied with such appa- 
 ratus. School libraries both for pupils and for teachers are very freely 
provided. 
Primary normal schools.—The departmental normal schools are board- 
ing schools, to which, however, day scholars are admitted. 
The buildings and material are provided by the departments. All 
the schools have practice schools of primary grade annexed, and nearly 
all have a second school or class for the training of directresses of in- 
fant (i. ¢., maternal) schools. 
The course of study is arranged for three years. 
The normal schools are in session ten and a half months annually. 
_ Secondary schools—The representative establishments for secondary 
instruction are the lycées or state schools. They have boarding 
departments, the household and scholastic affairs being kept entirely 
distinct. Both are regulated down to the minutest detail by provisions 
_ from the central authority. The head of the lycée is the principal or 
proviseur, who is simply an administrative officer. 
The most important functionary of the lycée next to the proviseur is 
the censor of studies (censeur des études), who regulates the discipline 
and studies. 
The head of the household is the steward (économe), and there must 
always be a resident chaplain. All of these officials are appointed by 
the minister of public instruction, and are directly responsible to the 
academic rector. . 
The professors, who reside outside of the establishment, confine 
themselves entirely to the work of instruction. The students are under 
the immediate surveillance of tutors (mattres répétitew's), to each oft. 
whom is assigned.a group of about thirty, for whose studies and con- 
duct he is responsible. The students are boarders (internes) or day 
students (ewternes). The former are said to belong to the internat, the 
latter to the externat, The boarders may be either penstonanttas full 
boarders, or demi-pensionnaires, who take one meal daily in the school. 
The average number of students in a lycée is five hundred ; the aver- 
age staff comprises thirty-eight officers and professors. y 
The course of study, which has been already described, covers ten’ 
years and is arranged in three divisions, elementary, grammar, and 
superior. The two lower divisions consist of three classes each, the 
highest division of four classes. 
The lowest class is called the preparatory; the next seven are named 
from the ordinal numbers, eight to second inclusive. These are fol- 
. lowed by the class of rhetoric and the class of philosophy. . ,

Pupils generally enter the lycées at 8 years of age and are expected 
to spend a year in each class, thus completing the full course at 18, and 
the special secondary course at 16 or 17. 
The discipline of the lycée is extremely rigid and mechanical. The 
routine is not exactly the same in all, but the following is a fair rep- 
resentation of a day’s program.’ 
The pupils rise at 5:30 and retire at 8:30.

The communal colleges may be full or partial course secondary schools. _ : 
The communes take the initiative in their establishment, and their 
boarding departments are controlled either by the municipalities or by 
private proprietors. 
Their scholastic régime is similar to that of the lycées, 
The law of December 21, 1830, creating lycées and communal colleges 
for girls completed the fréribtal provision for secondary instruction. 
The administration and studies of these institutions are managed 
with special reference to the aptitudes, needs, and probable careers of 
young women. Pupils enter at twelve years of age. The course is 
divided into two periods of three and of two years respectively, thus 
allowing five years for the full period. A sixth year may be added for 
students who desire to prepare for admission to superior institutions or 
for special vocations. 
Attendance at all classes of the secondary schools is stimulated by 
public scholarships (bourses) and peculiar enthusiasm is excited by ~ 
means of annual public competitive exercises, which have all the attract- 
ive features of great festivities. 
A normal school, designed to prepare a teaching force for the service 
of special Kanan instruction, was opened at Cluny in 1866, and in 
1881-a normal school for the preparation of women to serve as profes- — 
sors in the lycées and colleges for women was established at Sevres.

INSTITUTIONS FOR SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
  ~The institutions for superior instruction belonging to the State are | ; 
facultés, and professional and special schools. 
The facultés comprise groups of professional men assigned cack 
academic district for the service of liberal and professional education. - 
These groups are of five orders: Protestant theology, law, medicine, 
‘letters, and sciences. Paris alone has all five of the Hasunes Mont: 
pellier, Nancy, Lyons, and Lille have all save Protestant theology. In _ 
_ two academic districts the different facultés are not located in the same 
city. The facultés retain in many respects the characteristics impressed 
- upon them by Napoleon, who constituted them professional bodies — 
within the University, to maintain lectures, and to examine for and 
confer degrees.

    The present Government has greatly extended the teaching functions —_. 
* of the facultés, and has taken the first steps toward giving them the 
attributes and powers of corporate bodies. 
The necessity of providing for practical courses, of instruction was 
felt in respect to the facultés of medicine at an early period in their his- 
tory, and led in 1854 to the creation of professional schools, which are 
found in several of the academic districts. These schools are of two 
classes—preparatory and full course (écoles de plein exercice). Similar 
schools have also been provided for sciences and letters. These schools 
with the conférences and complementary courses supply the essential 
conditions of effective instruction. The development in this respect is 
shown by the fact that since 1877, conférences to the number of 129 and 
complementary courses to the number of 200 have been created, and 201 
new professorships established. Meanwhile, students have been.allured 
by the special inducement of scholarships (i. ¢., bourses), of which five 
hundred have been provided. 
The extension of the teaching functions has been further stimulated 
by the vast increase of material equipments, buildings, laboratories, ete. 
The results of these efforts are shown, says the minister in his official 
report, by the fact ‘“ that of the 17,630 students upon the register of the 
facultés in 1887-88, 3,693 were veritable students in the /facultés of 
letters and of science; whereas in 1875, if any were entered for those 
courses, they did not really pursue their studies in the facultés, but 
merely registered themselves,” an essential prerequisite to the rights’ 
of the degree examinations. 
The separate facultés have always had an official organization. The 
head of each group is the dean (doyen). An assistant is appointed, who~ 
may act for the dean if necessary, and a secretary for the service of the 
body. Until'a very recent date, however, the different facultés of a dis- 
trict (académie) were separate from each other, and after 1875 were want- 
ing in all the attributes of autonomy. Civil personality was secured to 
' them by a deeree of July 25, 1885, which empowered them to receive, 
hold, and administer property; a right conferred upon them in 1801, 
but suspended in 1875. A decree of December 28, 1885, carried the 
work of organization still further. This decree constituted in each 
academic district a council general of all the facultés of the district 
for the consideration of matters of common interest. The president of 
this council is the academic rector; the remaining members are the 
deans of the facultés, the directors of superior schools of pharmacy in 
districts where such schools have been formed, the director of a full 
course or of a preparatory school of pharmacy or of medicine, two 
delegates from each faculté elected for three years by the assembly of 
the facultés from the full professors, and a delegate from each full course 
or preparatory school elected in the same manner. 
The deans and directors of schools are charged, under the authority 
of the rectors, with the execution of the decisions of the council. Any 
decision of the council contrary to laws and rules is referred immedi-

ately by the rector to the iaiidatet of public instruction ; petiding his 
decision it is imperative. By the same decree there was constituted * 
also in each faculté a council and an assembly, The former, which is 
composed of full professors, deliberates upon the financial affairs of the 
_ faculté ; the latter, composed of all fall professors and assistants hay- 
ing a doctor’s degree, deliberates upon scholastic matters. Through the 
councils the facultés manage their own budgets, make up the lists from 
which their deans are selected, and give effective expression to their 
opinions on all matters relating to the creation of chairs, the develop- 
ment of programmes, and the discipline of students." 
The general courses of the facultés and schools are as a rule public 
‘ and are open to both sexes. Oertain courses are, however, reserved for 
students properly so called. These only are admitted to the conférences, 
where they are questioned upon the matter of the lesson, and to labora- . 
tory and other practical exercises. The attendants upon the courses 
of the professors are therefore of two classes, hearers and students. All 
aspirants for degrees belong to the latter course. The baccalaureate of 
letters or of science, being an essential prerequisite for all other degrees, 
marks the end of secondary and the beginning of superior instruction. 
To become a student in a faculté, it is necessary to inscribe one’s name 
upon the register, pay certain fees, and sustain certain examinations. * 
he inseription is renewed quarterly, the total number of renewals de- 
pending upon the length of the course. A fee is paid at each renewal. 
The several fees which students must pay are inscription fees (droits Vin- 
scription); fees forthe use of libraries (droits de bibliotheques) ; laboratory 
fees (droits de travaux pratiques), which are charged only in the fa- 
cultés and schools of medicine and pharmacy; examination fees (droits 
@examen). The amount of the several fees, library and inscription (i. e., 
tuition) fees excepted, varies in different courses. The former is 10 
franes ($2) per annum; the latter 30 francs per trimester. 
Three degrees, viz, paclialany licencié, and doctor, are conferred in 
every faculté save that of medicine. These degrees form an ascending 
series, which must be obtained in regular order. The faculté of medi- 
cine confers only the doctor’s degree, but candidates for this must not 
only be provided with the degree of bachelor of letters but also with 
that of bachelor of science. The facultés of law confer also a diploma 
(certificat de capacité), which does not require Beaoue classical study 
and admits one to practice as an attorney (avoué). | 
The present number of facultés, including 3 in Algiers, is 59; ; of su 
perior schools of pharmacy, 3; of schools of medicine and pharmacy; 
full course, 3; of preparatory Echt of medicine and Peennaey 14; 
of Biiparatory schools of science and letters, 3.

It will be seen by an examination of the table that the Paris feculta 
- comprised more than half the whole number of students, é. e., 9,140. All 
the facultés are represented in that group ; and the fame of the lecturers, 
the annual concourse of students from all parts of France eager to re- 
ceive their diplomas from the minister, the presence of many foreign 
the capital have maintained among the Paris professors asense of soli 
arity. This group is still called the “ University of Paris.” - 
The special schools which belong to the department of the minister students, the traditions of the past, and the stimulating influence pt 
        acts. They are as follows: 
The Oollege of France, located at Paris. The resources of this cel 
brated institution have been. greatly increased and its courses multipli d 
during the time of the republic. Its teaching personnel compri 
above 40 professors, men eminent in letters or science, who deliver 
lectures on almost every branch of human knowledge. Courses of pr: : r

tical study are also maintained for students of philology and of certain 
branches of science. 
The Museum of Natural History, a great scientific school, attached to 
the Jardin des Plantes. The buildings and material equipment for the 
work of this institution have been vastly increased since 1870, and it 
offers now to its numerous students, “to the savants of France and of 
foreign countries,” unsurpassed laboratory facilities for instruction and ~ 
research in every department of organic and inorganic matter. 
The magnificent collections of the “museum” are under the care of 
officials termed professeurs administrateurs whose duties are “to in- 
crease the collections, to undertake personal investigations, and to 
give a certain number of lessons in order to make their discoveries 
known.” 
The Practical School of High Studies (Ecole pratique des hautes études) 
is an institution founded at Paris by M. Dumy in 1868 for the pur- 
pose of “‘maintaining side by side with theoretic instruction the prac- 
tical exercises necessary to give the former its full effect.” It was 
originally divided into four sections, viz, mathematics, physics and 
chemistry, natural history and physiology, history and philology. A 
section of religion was added in 1885. ; 
The laboratories belonging to the faculties and to the varions scien- 
tific establishments are assigned for the use of the students of the Heole 
pratique des hautes études at the discretion of the minister. The sec- 
tion of history and philology is an independent institution, located 
near the Sorbonne. 
The Superior Normal School (Ecole normale supérieure), situated at 
Paris, is designed to qualify professors for the two higher orders of in- 
struction, i. ¢., secondary and superior. It is directly under the charge 
of the minister, who nominates the director and professors. Admission 
is secured by competitive examination, which is open only to French- 
men or naturalized foreigners. Candidates who are admitted pledge 
themselves to engage for ten years in the service of public instruction. 
The methods of instruction in this school are eminently practical. 
The students do not simply listen to lectures and take notes; they 
are questioned and they ask questions upon the subjects of study; they 
discuss the corrections made in the exercises and compusitions; they 
are also required to give lessons upon assigned subjects. 
The library and equipment for practical work have been greatly ex- 
tended in recent years, and the salaries of the professors increased. 
The school draws to itself the élite of the French students, and its 
fame and influence are continually increased by the brilliant achieve- 
ments of its graduates. 
The *“ Ecole des chartes,” at Paris, is designed to train paleographists 
forservice as librarians and keepers of records. The funds of the school 
were increased threefold in the first decade of the republic. 
The French School at Athens affords special students the opportunity

of residence in Greece for the purpose of extended archeological r 
search. The number of such students is limited to 6. They must beai 
least thirty years of age and possessed of the degree of doctor of le 
ters, or its equivalent. They are appointed by the minister upon th 
results of competitive examination. \ 
The French School of Archeology at. Rome is an outcome of the schoo 
at Athens. By its provision the members of the former may reside 
three months in Italy for the purpose of studying its monuments and 
pursuing their researches in its libraries before proceeding to Athens. 
The School of Living Oriental Languages, situated at Paris, is intende 
to give students a practical knowledge of eastern languages, and for 
the publication of learned treatises. | | 
In addition to the facultés and the special schools several astro- 
nomic and meteorologic bureaus maintained by the state and under 
general direction of the minister of public instruction are included in 
the department of superior instruction, as are also the special normal 
schools, designed to prepare teachers for particular grades of instruction, 
PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES (FACULTES LIBRES). t j 
The conflict between church and State with respect to the control of 
education, which has not ceased since the Revolution of 1789, has pro- 
foundly affected the higher institutions. At one moment a tolerant 
policy is adopted to be followed the next by repressive measures. The 
latest action of the Government with respect to private universities is 
the law of March 18, 1880, depriving them of representation in the 
degree examinations and awards. While this act does not diminish 
their liberty in respect to instruction, it tends to lessen their dignity 
and influence. The State facultés of Catholic theology having been 
deprived of public appropriations in 1885 this subject is now confined 
to private facultés in Paris, Lille, and Toulouse. The remaining private 
facultés and their attendance in 1887-88 were as follows: '

AUXILIARY ASSOCIATIONS, | 
The general government, which takes the initiative in all measures 
affecting the organization of public instruction, also establishes many 
special agencies for the promotion of the work. | | 
Prominent among these is the Musée Pédagogique, created at Paris in 
1879. This institution is under the charge of one of the general
-P-A-G-E-217
  
THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF FRANCE. 147 
inspectors of primary instruction, and of a council nominated by the 
minister of public instruction. It includes a museum and a library for 
the collection of all material which may aid the work or the researches 
of persons engaged in primary instruction. Its collections ‘comprise 
school furniture, scientific apparatus, illustrative material, etc., his- 
torical and statistical documents, text-books, pedagogical works, and 
educational journals. It seeks by timely publications to make known 
the best methods of instruction, and the best models for the construe- 
tion of school-houses, plans for class rooms, etc. 
The Musée Pédagogique has become also a center of preparation for 
aspirants for the various examinations which admit to the higher grades 
of the teaching service. Regular conferences are held in its halls which 
give these aspirants the benefit of lectures and lessons conducted by 
specialists. 
The museum is open to the general public every Thursday and Sun- 
day from 10 to 5 o’clock. For persons having cards of admission the 
library and museum are open every day excepting Monday from 10 till 
5 and the library from 8 to 10 in the evening. 
The library includes a circulating division which is free to all persons 
engaged in teaching. The request for the privilege of taking books is 
addressed to the minister. Foreigners properly accredited can share in 
the privilege. 
Special schools are maintained by the state for the instruction of re- 
cruits in the marine service. The demand for elementary instruction 
for this class has diminished under the decision of the minister of marine 
in 1883, prohibiting the enlistment of illiterates. 
The existing provision comprises elementary schools, training ships, 
and a normal course for the instructors. 
The care of the state extends to illiterate criminals, for whom instruc- 
tion is provided in the penitentiaries. 
Many agencies auxiliary to the work of education receive their im- 
pulse from the general government, but depend for their development 
upon the action of localities. To this category belong the local funds 
‘(caisses des écoles) for the aid of indigent pupils, the purchase of prizes, 
ete., required by the law of March 28, 1882. In 1887 such funds were 
seported from 50 per cent. of the communes. : The Paris fand amounted 
to $234,521. 
School savings banks (caisses dépargne scolaires).—The government has 
shown great sympathy with the efforts made by teachers to estab- 
lish school savings banks. ‘The number of these banks increases each 
year, and in 1887 reached a total of 22,383, with 478,173 depositors and 
deposits amounting to $2,534,662. 
Adulé classes. —Olasses for the instruction of adults form an important 
part of the provision for popular education. 
In 1886-87 such classes were maintained in 7,443 communes, or 20 
per cent. of the whole number. They were attended by 184,612 pupils, 
of whom 156,590 were men and 2,802 women. As compared with

: | ot 
148 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. : } 
1881-82 the total shows a decrease of 411,710, or very nearly 70 per cent., 
a change which is undoubtedly due to the increase of primary school 
and the operations of the obligatory law. Since 1882 the adult ae 
have been distinguished as elementary and complementary; the forme: 
being for illiterate adults, the latter for the continuation of studies. 
The elementary classes comprise only 30 per cent. of the adult pane 7 i 
These statistics do not include the auditors attracted to public lecture: 
of which no estimate can be given. | 
Local school attendance committee.—The law of March 28, 1882, pro- 
vided for the formation of local commissions (commissions scolaires) t 
keep watch over the matter of school attendance and report violations 
of the law. 
The law of October 30, 1886, re-enforced the provision, but the com- 
missions have so far practically failed. ce | 
Teachers’ conferences.—Oonferences of teachers are held in all the de- 
partments, and serve, like the teachers’ institutes of our own countr, "5 
to foster professional zeal. In addition to the local conferences there 
is an annual conference of teachers, held generally under the auspices 
of the minister of public instruction. ‘fhe subjects for. discussion are 
announced beforehand, and the papers presented and the deliberations 
generally are characterized by breadth of thought, lucid and logical 
treatment, and finished style. | 
Mutual aid societies, established by the voluntary action of the teach- 
ers, exist in seventy-eight departments of France. 
" In 1886 an association was founded at Paris, under the patronageot the 
minister of public instruction, for the care of the orphans of elementar 
teachers. This association, known as the akive de VOrphelinat de 
VPEnseignement Primaire,” receives gifts and appropriations from ap 
state and departments, the communes, and private individuals. It do 
not maintain anorphanage, but provides for the care of orphaus in their 
native places. | 
Many private societies exist for the maintenance of scholastic insti- 
tutions, the improvement of methods of instruction, and the increase of 
public interest in the general progress of education. Some of these an- 
tedate the present Republic, others are of recent origin. | 
_The Polytechnic Association was founded in 1830 by the graduates 
of the Polytechnic School, for the purpose of conducting preparato: 
courses of industrial and technical training. The courses are generally 
open to both sexes; a small number are limited i women. Such are 
courses for training in the cutting and fitting of garments, decorative 
painting, the making of artificial flowers, and commercial courses for 
young girls. | | 
The number of courses maintained in Paris is very large, and the 
work extends to the suburbs of the city.

TIE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF FRANCE. 149 
The most interesting and important of recently formed societies is 
the Alumni Association of Paris students (Association générale des 
étudiants des facultés et écoles supériewres de Paris). 
The society is under the protection of the general council of the 
Paris facultés, and is presided over by the rector, to whom its property 
is remitted in case of its dissolution. It forms a means of union between 
the professors and the students, and between the students of the differ- 
ent facultés. 
A fund is accumulating for the ultimate purchase of a building for 
the permanent home of the society ; its temporary quarters are conven- 
ient and commodious, The library of the society, which is open from 
8 o’clock in the morning until midnight, comprises 2,000 volumes and 
200 current journals. Here gratuitous lessons are given in law, science, ~ 
languages, etc. Receptions to distinguished foreigners, dramatic en- 
tertainments, etc., promote social and intellectual comradeship. A fund 
is also maintained for the assistance of students; medical attendance 
is furnished without charge, and arrangements are made with many 
merchants for reduction of prices to members of the society. 
The honorary members number about 400; they pay an annual fee, 
and have all the privileges of the society, but no voice in its adminis- 
tration. The active members number about 3,500; they pay an annual 
fee of 18 francs ($3.50). 
Besides the income from fees and gifts, the society has an annual 
subvention of $400 from the city of Paris. 
The Society for the Promotion of Physical Culture (Le comité pour la 
propagation des exercices physiques dans Véducation), founded at Paris in 
1888 under the presidency of Jules Simon, promises to work important 
changes in the general system of education for young men. 
That the state attempts no monopoly of education is abundantly 
proven by the multiplication of private societies, and the decided in- 
fluence which they exercise over educational methods and ideals. 
It is a significant fact that while the policy of the Republic opposes 
both directly and indirectly the scholastic work of the church, it has 
had the effect of stimulating all other forms of private and local activity. 
Paris, especially, is in a ferment of educational effort. Here the public 
system in all its grades reaches the highest perfection; here all kinds 
of auxiliary agencies have their most vigorous development. It would 
be impossible to suggest even in this place the resources which the 
capital devotes to the diffusion of knowledge or the various modes in 
which these are applied. So far as regards public elementary schools, 
the city draws nothing from the state, meeting the entire expenditure 
from its own budget. For current expenditure alone, the municipal 
appropriations in 1888 were $3,970,702. ‘fhe increase in this respect 
since 1877 has been enormous, amounting in 1888 to 150 per cent. of 
the whole appropriation at the beginning of the decade.

INTRODUCTION. . { 
The German Empire as such has no public-school system. All public 
educational institutions in Germany are founded and maintained by the 
separate states and free cities that constitute the empire, or they are the * 
result of private or corporate efforts. Hence, to know the German schools 
accurately would necessitate the study of the school systems of each 
kingdom, duchy, principality, and free city in Germany. But since 
Prussia, the largest state in the empire, plays a leading réle among the 
many states, and its school system is the type of those of other states; 
furthermore, since in Prussia we have to look for the beginnings of that 
marvelous result of modern civilization, “The public school called in 
existence, partly supported, and wholly directed by the state,”—it woul 
‘seem as though a statement of what is found in Prussia supplemente: 
by occasional reference to other countries would suffice. 
I.—HIsToRIoAL VIEW. i 
During the sixteenth century the necessity of instructing children 
religion gave rise to what is now known in Germany as the ‘“ People’s 
Schools.” There had been schools, of course, ever since Charlemagne’s 
“schola palatina,” but not until the time of the great church reforma- 
tion (A. D, 1517) were efforts made in behalf of teaching the masses, 
not until then were the lower and lowest strata of society drawn in 
the pale of influence of such schools, though it was done on Sundays 
only. Naturally the lower schools were servants of the church whi 
150 |
-P-A-G-E-221
  SCHOOLS OF GERMANY, AUSTRIA, AND SWITZERLAND, 151 
had called them into life. In 1529 Luther’s catechism appeared, and it 
became the first text-book. In 1540 a Saxon ecclesiastical decree estab- 
plished day schools. This was imitated in all the German Protestant 
states. In the cities the schools had a more fertile soil, since the cities 
had all through the Middle Ages been the centers of culture, the asy- 
lums, so to speak, of poetry and art, education and religion, commerce 
and industry. Many ancient “writing schools” had been preserved 
there. These became nuclei of new schools, called ‘citizens’ schools.” 
Wittenberg even established a “girls’ school” in 1533, the first girls’ 
school known in the history of education. Johann Bugenhagen, in 
Braunschweig, the intimate friend of Martin Luther, was especially , 
active in behalf of schools, by publishing regulations for “German 
schools,” embracing country schools, city schools, Latin schools, and | 
girls’ schools” (German schools, in contradistinction to classical schools, 
in which Latin was the medium of instruction). These schools were 
even at that early day supported (a) by the communities, and (b) by tuition 
fees. Bugenhagen’s instructions were also copied in the free cities— 
Liibeck, Hamburg, and Bremen. Wherever the Reformation found a 
foothold schools sprang up, and if it had not been for the terrible Thirty 
Years’ War (1618-1648) the schools in Germany would have developed 
into a healthy system quite early; but that most destructive war ever 
known in history checked the growth of the German school system, as 
it paralyzed all the political and social life of the nation. 
It is not necessary to follow the development of the German school 
system through all its various stages ; suffice it to say, that it remained 
the handmaid of the church until the time of Frederick the Great of 
Prussia, about 1760. With far-sighted policy he endeavored to make 
the school what it. subsequently became, the powerful auxiliary of the 
state, at all times, alike during political disaster and prosperity. Ever 
since that time the Prussian “ people’s school,” and with it that of Sax- 
ony, Wiirtemberg, Bavaria, etc., has remained under state government, 
and, mirror-like, it has reflected the different phases of political life of the 
German nation. Since Frederick could not raise the means for support 
of the schools, owing to his wars for the possession of Silesia, he was 
not very successful in his attempts at school reform, but it will remain 
one of his chief merits that he saw the necessity of a consistent system 
of public instruction assisted by state aid, and called into existence by 
the state when the communities failed in this regard. During the 
reign of his successor, Frederick William II, a mistake was made 
by limiting the matter of instruction to a minimum, and paying almost 
exclusive attention to religious instruction. But in 1799 the govern- 
ment at Berlin infused new life into the public (or people’s) schools, 
and established the principle ‘“ that instruction in religion in these 
schools should confine itself to the general truths of religion, and the 
morals underlying all church parties; in other words, it should be 
Christian, but nonsectarian.” This principle is still adhered to.

4152 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
In the cities a reformatory movement in the management of th 
schools occurred toward the close of the eighteenth century. The citi 
zens’ and classical schools were supplemented. by. LReateotwton (school 
which paid more attention to the demands of modern life than did th 
classical schools). In many small towns the Latin schools were con 
verted into citizens’ schools, so that the latter came to be regarded 
as standing between the elementary and the classical schools; ory 
gous to our (a) primary, (b) intermediate, and (c) high schools, it was 
considered that (a) elementary, (b) citizens’, and (¢) classical schools were 
and ought to be distinct establishments of one system. If this idea a 
been carried out systematically it would have resulted in the establish- 
ment of a system such as our common-school system. But the aa 
distinctions among the people caused a differentiation, and to-day the 
three grades of schools—people’s, middle, and classical schools—are not 
in organic connection with one another. 
During the reign of Frederick William III (1840) the schools grad. 
ually improved. Impulses from without, notably the teaching of Pes 
talozzi, moved authorities and teachers to bestow more attention upor 
methods, courses of study, and especially upon the training of teachers 
This early attempt at building up a profession for teachers has had won- 
derful results. Prussia and other German states in this particular ar 
far ahead of other nations, having acted with far-sighted policy, and 
by acknowledging the now well-understood maxim that “the teacher is 
the school,” the teaching profession in Germany has become a pride ot 
the nation. 
The time of general readjustment of Prussian affairs after the Nap: 
leonic wars was also the time of rejuvenation of t the Prussian school: 
Gradually the system was improved; the ideas of Pestalozzi permeate 
it, until it became the model for other nations. But while other nation: 
notably the French and English, have left educational efforts to the te 
der mercies of private enterprise, Prussia has consistently worked out a 
system of state schools since the time of Frederick the Great, and hence is 
a hundred years abead of other nations in results and experience. From 
1854 till 1872 the schools in Prussia were handicapped greatly by nar- 
row regulations and short-sighted policy, but after the Franco- Prussian 
war new life was infused into all governmental efforts by appealing 
to the liberal element of the nation. The general regulations of Mini 
ter Falk, issued in October, 1872, are still in force, only slightly modi- 
fied by his successors. During the last'twenty years the people’s school 
have suffered in consequence of the immoderate demands made by th

\ | The people’s schools comprise those educational institutions whic 
are devoted to the elementary instruction of the youth of the nation, an 
are intended “ to impart the knowledge and skill necessary to ration

beings” (verniinftige Wesen). The time within which this instruction 
is offered is between the sixth and fourteenth years of age; confirma- 
tion in church defines the termination of the school course.. Chil- 
dren of parents who refuse to join a church are permitted to leave 
the school when they have completed the prescribed course and passed 
the regular annual examination. The people’s school may be purely 
elementary, as in the country, or of a higher grade, as it frequently is 
in the cities, where the upper grades partake of the nature of a school 
which goes beyond the mere rudiments. Aside from the people’s 
schools there are others that receive pupils at as early an age as the 
people’s schools, but present the matter of instruction in a more scien- 
tific, that is to say, in a less elementary and popular way, with the de- 
sign of their pupils remaining in school longer than the fourteenth year 
of age, namely, till the seventeenth or nineteenth year; such are the so- 
ealled gymnasia and realschulen, higher citizens’ schools, industrial 
schools, technical schools, and young ladies’ academies. None of these 
schools are considered people’s schools. The latter form the nearest ap- 
proach to common schools (in the American acceptation of the word) 
ever attempted in Germany. 
The public schools provided for in the constitution.—In order to under- 
stand how deep rooted public education is in Prussia we will quote from 
the Constitution of Prussia. 
ARTICLE 20. Science and the teaching of science are free. 
ARTICLE 21, For the education of the young public schools shall be established and 
maintained. Parents and guardians must not leave their children or wards without 
that instruction which is prescribed for the public schools. 
ARTICLE 22. To give instruction and to establish schools is allowed to every one 
who can prove to the state authorities moral, scientific, and technical capability. 
ARTICLE 23. All public and private educational institutions aro under the supervi- 
sion of the state authorities. Teachers of public schools have the rights and duties 
of officers of the state. (In this clause the state reserves for itself the right of prop- 
erly preparing the teachers, and assumes the duty of pensioning them.) 
ARTICLE 24, Religious instruction is left to the respective religious societies. (This 
passage was amended subsequently.) The external management of schools is left to 
the civil communities, while the State employs the teachers and provides for the nec- 
essary number and training of teachers. 
ARTICLE 25, The means for establishing, maintaining, and extending the public- 
school system are furnished by the communities, and only in cases of inability does the 
state furnish the means, (This has subsequently been amended. ‘The state now 
bears 18 per cent. of the cost of maintaining the public elementary schools, and about 
34 per cent. of that of the secondary schools.) Rights acquired by private grants in 
behalf of education shall be inviolate. The state guarantees public-school teachers 
a fixed income. Instruction in the public schools is free of charge. (This was not 
carried out until October 1, 1683; see chapter ‘‘ Finances.”) 
ARTICLE 26, A special school law regulates all educational affairs in the state. 
Articiu 112. And till the law mentioned in article 26 is passed, the former legal 
status, so far as it does not conflict with the constitution, shall remain in force. 
It is significant that at present, 40 years after the adoption of the 
constitution, this general school law has not yet been passed. Laws

which partially cover the ground have been adopted, but substantial, 
the public schools are still governed by the *] “ee of Educational > 
Ecclesiastical, and Medical Affairs.” 
TI.—FINANCES. | i 
Like all of the States of the former Northwest Territory in this coun- 
try, Prussia has an irreducible school fund, the origin of which is foun 
in the sequestration of church property, sales of land, bequests, fine 
and sundry other sources. It would lead too far to specify all th 
sources. Suffice it to say this fund is inadequate for the maintenance 
of the schools. According to the last official report of the Prussia 
Government, the interest of this fund defrayed but a small percentag 
namely, 7,323,641 marks ($1,830,910), in a total of 116,615,648 maria 
($29,153,912). By means of state taxes the state’s portion (includin 
the interest of this fund) of the cost of maintaining the public schools 
amounted to over 18 per cent., while the proportion borne by the coms 
munities amounted to a little less than 82 per cent. 
The current expenses for maintaining the schools in 1886-87, that is, 
the salaries, etc., amounted to 75,245,144 marks ($18,811,286), or 64 
per cent. of the sum total, 116,615,648 marks ($29,153,912); 41,370,50 
marks ($10,342,626) were spent for buildings and improvements, or 35. 
per cent.! 
Most of the communities in Prussia still require tuition fees, but since 
October 1, 1888, the state assumes a portion of the means raised for 
merly by ‘alition fees. It pays annually $100 for each principal, $50 fo: 
each regular teacher, $37.50 for éach female teacher, and $25 for tem- 
porary assistants. The law was passed for the purpose of enabling the 
communities to abolish tuition fees ; but since the sums paid by the state 
are too small, most of the cities continue collecting the fees, for which 
a proviso in the law gives authority. Berlin, Frankfort, and more tha: 
a dozen other cities in Prussia have abolished fees altogether, an 
now raise their share of the expenses by direct taxation and sundr, 
minor sources, chiefly by fines. All the liberal parties advocate th 
abolishment of fees, but the great demands upon the pockets of the citi-’ 
zens caused by recent and very extensive improvements make it impos- 
sible to carry out this design. 
We are, in this country, under the impression that the state id 
Prussia governs the schools exclusively. This is a mistake, for in the 
financial management and establishment of new schools and improve- 
ment of their exterior condition the cities in Prussia are very much 
more independent than are the cities in America of their respective 
State legislatures.

IV.—SUPERYVISION. 
The elementary schools of Prussia, the so-called ‘“ people’s schools,” 
have less supervision than our American city schools, because the 
teachers all have professional training. Still there is a general super- 
vision exercised by the state. The provincial governments, the 
representatives of the Minister of Education, supervise the systems of 
schools in their provinces indirectly, by examining the teachers at 
their graduation from the normal schools. These school councilors, 
as they are called, make occasional visits to schools, here and there, 
but generally are considered the courts of appeal in school matters. 
Local supervision is exercised by the mayors and clergymen. In 
cities where a school commission exists that commission either super- 
vises the schools through its members or employs professional school 
inspectors. Their duties are to all intents and purposes similar to those 
of our city-school superintendents. Clergymen have been greatly dis- 
credited as school inspectors during the liberal era in Prussia, Saxony, 
Bavaria, and other states; while in Wiirtemberg a law requires 
the school inspector to be a clergyman. Many of the inspectors in 
Prussia and other states are heads of normal schools, high schools, ete. 
Prussia is divided into twelve provinces—LHastern and Western Prus- 
sia (on the Baltic), Pomerania, Posen, Brandenburg, Silesia, Saxony, 
Schleswig-Holstein, Hanover, Westphalia, Ihenish Prussia, and Hesse- 
Nassau. Each province is subdivided into three or four governmental 
districts. These are divided into kreise (circuits, counties), and the 
latter into communities or townships. Large cities, such as Berlin, 
Cologne, Frankfort, and others, are kreise by themselves, analogous to 
New York City and County, Chicago and Cook County. The commu- 
nities vary considerably in size and number of inhabitants, but a school 
is provided for every 500 inhabitants. 
Kreis (county) supervisors are found frequently, but the system of 
county supervision is not a general one, owing to the fact that the 
affairs of the schools in Prussia are not systematically regulated by 
law. : 
The school reports of the various inspectors are not published, but 
may be examined in their offices. Secret reports are also required, and 
are sent to the provincial headquarters. This practice of secretly report- 
ing upon the teachers and their work has been at times discouraged 
and discredited, but to a limited extent it is still in practice. 
In Berlin and other large cities the administration of the lowerschools 
is similar to that of the American common schools. There is a school 
commission (a committee of the city council), a general superintendent 
(called “school councilor”), several assistant superintendents (called 
“ district inspectors”), a principal (called ‘‘rector”) at the head of each 
school building, and many associate teachers, but very few subordinate 
teachers. There is a distinction made between associate and subordi- 
nate teachers.

  156 ‘ EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
V.—THE TEACHERS. 
Normal schools.—It is well understood that the professional trainin 
of teachers in Prussia is the foundation of strength of the people’ 
schools.1. The earliest attempts on the part of the State at improvinu 
the schools. were directed to establishing normal schools for the profes- 
sional training of teachers. While in this country and in England the 
idea seems to prevail widely that normal-school preparation is not ab- 
solutely necessary for teaching, in Prussia it is considered the first and 
foremost need that the teachers be theoretically and practically taught 
how to teach. Hence the many normal schools each have a practice 
school where the norinal students acquire practical experience in teach- 
ing. 
In 1889 Prussiahad 106 normal schools for men and 8 for women. Of 
_ these 114 schools, 72 were Protestant, 38 Catholic, 4 mixed. There were 
689 professors and instructurs engaged in them, while the preparatory 
schools had 78 teachers. The number of students in the normal school 
in 1888 was 8,507 (against 9,400 in 1869), and the number of students ia 
preparatory schools 1,991. 
The expenses of the state for normal schools (all Prussian normal 
schools being’ state institutions) is about 600 marks (or $150) per an- 
num per student. The number of students seems to be exceptionally 
small, if compared with the number in our country, but we must not 
measure Prussia by an American standard. The “supply” is mor 
than sufficient, because the “ consumption” is not near so great as wit 
us. Asarule, a teacher in Prussia is a teacheralways. In Berlin, for 
instance, 108 new teachers were employed last year, and of these, 102 
were for newly established schools; hence only six vacancies occurred 
in a corps of more than 3,000. If we compare this with the large num- 
ber of changes taking place anuually in our cities, it becomes obvious 
that 114 normal schools are sufficient for Prussia. © 
The course of study in normal schools in Prussia is one of three or four 
years. Itembraces a thorough review of the common branches, the high 
school branches, theoretical and practical instruction in instrumenta 
music, drawing, gymnastics, and pedagogy (history of education, psy- 
chology, theory and practice of teaching). No foreign languages are 
taught in Prussian normal schools. | 
Most of these normal schools are situated in small towns of 4,000 to 
8,000 inhabitants ; indeed but very few are found in large cities (two 
in Berlin). The reason of this is found in the desire to keep the young 
would-be teachers free from the temptations of a large city. he 
  
as a profession, and this recognition pervades all classes of society. The teacher 0: 
any school or grade ranks with his clerical, legal, and medical brother. Indeed, s 
far as my observations go, the teachers of Germany, as a class, stand higher in the 
estimation of the people than do membz7rts of other professions, and worthily so.—[J. 
T. Prince, agent Massachusetts Board of Education. ] 1Thus we see that there is on the part of the government a recognition of acer of 
 
-P-A-G-E-227
  
SCHOOLS OF GERMANY, AUSTRIA, AND SWITZERLAND. 157 
schools are boarding-schools—that is, the students live in the school 
building, and are kept under rigid control all daylong. The following 
is a daily programme adhered to in a Prussian normal school: 6 o’clock 
A.M., rising; 6:30 till 7:30, preparing lessons under supervision; 7:30 
till 7:50, breakfast; 7:50 till 8, religious exercises in chapel ; 8 till 1, five 
or six lessons in experimental teaching; 1 till 1:30, dinner; 1:30 till 2, 
playing and walking in the grounds; 2 till 5, lessons in the academic 
department ; 5 till 6, practice in instrumental music; 6 till 7, exercises 
out doors and gymnastics; 7 till 7:30, supper ;. 7:30 till 9:30 working and 
studying in class rooms under supervision ; 9:50 till 10, evening prayer; 
10, hour for retiring. 
Examinations.—Previous to entering a normal school, many students 
pass a year or two in a preparatory school, but this is not obligatory. 
They may acquire their previous education anywhere. The state, being 
at times unable to secure a sufficient number of students, pays a pre- 
mium to teachers of good repute who prepare boys for the normal 
schools. There is a rigid examination for admission. At the close of 
the course a still more rigid examination precedes graduation. A stu- 
dent rarely fails to graduate, the government having taken the respon- 
sibility for his professional education. But the authorities grade the 
diplomas I, Ia, II, Ifb, III, and 1V. A teacher whose diploma numbers 
IV is not likely ever to obtain a lucrative position. This marking or 
grading of the diplomas is analogous to the issuing of diplomas in this 
country for one, two, three, or more years. A graduate of good stand- 
ing finds a place as teacher without difficulty. He spends two years in 
active work in the school room and then presents himself for his final 
examination (the ‘‘repetition” examination). If he passes that he is 
free-from further examinations and is recognized as a professional 
teacher all over the empire. There is, however, little chance for him to 
be appointed to secondary schools, except occasionally in the lowest 
grades. The teachers and professors in the middle and high schools 
are nearly all university men. All normal school examinations are 
conducted by the faculty in the presence of a provincial school coun- 
cillor. It is a postulate of the Prussian, and in fine, of the German 
Government, that the teacher is a servant or officer of the state, and 
as such must receive his training from the state. 
Prussia had in 1887 in round numbers 75,000 teachers in the people’s 
schools, of whom 10.6 per cent. were women, 89.4 per cent. men. 
Appointment.—The appointment of teachers is not regulated by a 
general law. The power of electing the teachers is vested in communal 
school authorities where such authorities exist. In country places the 
cireuit (Kreis) authorities perform this function, but whether elected 
by city authorities, or appointed by circuit inspectors, or chosen, by 
patrons, the selection is subject to the confirmation of the representa- 
tive of the government, be he the representative of the county, pro- 
vincial, or state government, as the case may be. It must always be  
-P-A-G-E-228
borne in mind that the Prussian governmental edifice is nota Keron ace 
built on virgin soil as in America, where no historical obstacles ob 
structed the building, but a very complicated structure, which had t 
accommodate itself to existing circumstances and historical obstacles ; 
hence the seemingly irregular mode of procedure in teachers’ appoint 
ments. In the main the principle is adhered to, that the local author 
ities nominate the teachers and the government confirms or rqents th 
nomination. 
The legal and social position of the teacher is much better defined i i 
Prussia than in many other countries. He receives a pension afte 
having taught a certain number of years, and his widow and orphan: 
are entitled to support, though this support rarely amounts to more 
than one-half of the teacher’s salary. By means of codperation th 
teachers of every German state have founded insurance, codperative, 
and other societies for mutual aid—societies which, in a measure, sup, 
plement the measures of the state. 
Salaries.—The last official school report of Prussia, that for 1887, 4 AS: EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. | . 
the average salary of the teachers in the people’s or elementary school 
to be as follows: 
Average in the kingdom: ! Average in the cities:

1887, 1,067 = $256. 1887, 1,279 = $319. 
1878, 1,102 = $275. 1878, 1,414 = $353. 
This shows a decrease in eight years of eighteen dollars in the ee 
and of thirty-three dollars in the cities. These salaries are comparatively 
smaller than in America, but it must be remembered that the t acher. 
in Prussia have no rent to pay, as they live in dwellings attached to th 
schoolhouses. Calculating the rent at 20 per cent., the average salar; 
may be considered to be $340. The salaries of rectors (principals) o 
large elementary schools in cities are higher. The teachers and profes 
sors of middle and high schools are not included in the av erages men- 
tioned above; their salaries range much higher than the foregoing 
averages.! 
‘ VI.—TuHE SCHOOLS. | 
School age and compulsory attendance.—The legal school age is from 
the sixth (completed) to the fourteenth (completed) year. There are, 
however, exceptions in regard to the maximum limit. Confirmation i 
the Protestant church or first communion in the Catholic church termi- 
  
country, are small, but when we remember that the purchasing power of money i 
far greater in Germany than it: is here, that the salaries in all professions are low, 
that the tenure of office of the teacher is very strong, and that liberal government is 1The salaries of teachers, compared with what is paid for similar service in our a

nates attendance; hence children in rural districts frequently leave 
school at the completion of the thirteenth year. Attendance in school 
is compulsory. This compulsion, distasteful as it may seem to citizens 
_of a republic, has become a leading feature of the foremost European 
nations. In Germany it is adopted in all the states without exception. 
School attendance is insured by long habit and tradition. “The idea 
of compulsory attendance has taken so deep a root in the country, that 
it forms one of the most ordinary conceptions of the people” (C. C. 
Perry). More than a hundred and fifty years ago the government in- 
sisted upon regular attendance, and through the enforcement of minis- 
terial orders it had become almost a habit with the people, so that the 
framers of the constitution (submitted to the King and sworn to by him 
in 1850) could safely introduce the compulsory attendance clause. 
This compulsion refers only to elementary instruction from the age of 
six to that of fourteen, and does not apply to those receiving instruction 
in other than the people’s schools; temporary absences for valid reasons 
may be granted, which reasons are very similar in all the states. A ppli- 
cations for permanent exemption, however, are relatively rare, for there 
are comparatively few private schools and very little private tuition; the 
children of the higher strata of society are taught generally, when not at 
primary schools, in preparatory schools attached to the high schools. 
Default in attendance is punishable by fine or imprisonment, but the 
latter is rare. If parents are found unable to govern their children, the 
state takes care of the latter in reformatory institutions. 
The percentage of absence is variously estimated at between 3 and 10 
per cent., never more. No special law exists against child labor in fac- 
tories, for the compulsory attendance law meets such cases effectively. 
School terms and length of sessions.—The school year begins at Easter, 
and commonly lasts from forty-five to forty-six weeks. Vacations are at 
Easter (one week), at Whitsuntide (one week), at Christmas (one week), 
and at harvest time (three or four weeks). The daily sessions last six 
hours, from 8 till 12 and 2 till 4; orfrom& till 1 and 3 till 4; or from 8 
till 2. There is no whole holiday on Saturday as in this country, but 
the schools are closed Wednesday and Saturday afternoons. 
Schoolthouses.—The schoolhouses in Prussia, judged from an Ameri- 
can standpoint, are insignificant looking and incommodious, but in the 
cities great progress has been made in school architecture. Forty-one 
million marks (about $10,000,000) were expended in 1886-87 for the 
erection and improvement of buildings for elementary schools. Most 
schoolhouses in cities are of recent origin, as is seen from the following 
statement: . 
From 1874 till 1882, 5,975 new buildings were erected and 2,710 build. 
ings were enlarged, at a total cost of 117,000,000 marks ($29,250,000). 
From 1883 till 1886, 3,977 new buildings were erected and 3,975 build- 
ings were enlarged, at a total cost of 104,000,000 ($26,000,000), 
Bighty-seven per cent. of the cost of erection was defrayed by the 
communities, 13 by the state,
-P-A-G-E-230
  160 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
The seatings aro not single desks and chairs, but long benches and 
desks attached. The normal number of pupils to the teacher varies 
between 70 and 80, and even at that rate the number of buildings and 
teachers is not sufficient; hence the authorities resort to half-day schools, 
According to the official report, 2,604,874 out of 4,838,247, or about 5: 
per cent., are seated in classes of not more than 75 each; while 2,233,373, 
ér about 46 per cent., are seated in overcrowded schoolrooms. The re- 
port mentioned states that there are: 1

* Apparatus.—Generally the schools are well supplied with all neces- - 
sary apparatus, such as charts, maps, models, simple instruments, 0 
jects of natural history, etc. In this respect the schools in Germany are 
furnished better than the average school in America. Many schools 
have a little museum and library. All of this is easily understood if 
we remember that in Germany teaching is a profession. 
Hygienic precautions.—The school authorities insist upon certain 
precautionary measures, such as vaccination certificates and ovca- 
sional visits from physicians; the German school, being subject to a 
centralized government, is more thoroughly precautionary than in this 
country. In time of epidemics schools are dismissed by the local au- 
thorities on short notice. | 
VII.—INSTRUCTION. | 
Course of study.—The course of study in elementary schools embraces 
religion, reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, singing, drawing, nat- 
ural history, natural science, history of man. No text-books are used for 
natural history, natural science, or history of man ; this instruction is oral. 
While in arithmetic, it may be said, the German schools are less ca 
ficient than the American, their course of study is more comprehensive 
than the average American course, and the advancement made in Ger- 
many in nearly all the studies is morerapid than in America. This fact is 
easily accounted for by (a) the difficult spelling of the English language; 
(d) the efforts made in learning and applying the tables of our arbi- 
trary measures and weights; (c) the greater length of school sessions 
and terms; and (d) the want of a profession of teaching in this country, 
and consequent lack of proper teaching. These are the most important 
causes. 
Germany is very rich in text-books. In no country is a greater 
variety of text-books published than in Germany, and though this may    
-P-A-G-E-231
      Sy 
SCHOOLS OF GERMANY, AUSTRIA, AND SWITZERLAND, 161 
seem a disadvantage, its advantages preponderate. It secures greater 
variety in teaching and a very beneficial and healthy competition among 
schools and especially teachers. Of course the children of a school 
and of a community are required to use the same books. 
Methods of teaching.—It would be utterly impossible without writing 
a book to make a comprehensive statement concerning the methods 
of instruction used in Germany. . Suffice it to say, there is no undue 
prominence given to the memory. Very little is learned by heart or by 
rote. The first object of the teacher is to make his pupils observe 
things, comprehend facts, and to lead them from stage to stage, so.as to 
keep up an eager interest. Hon. Samuel Smith, of England, in his re- 
port on the German schools says : 
I saw no signs of weariness or apathy among either teachers or scholars. The 
teaching was all viva voce, the teacher always standing beside the black-board and 
illustrating his subject by object lessons. The instraction was through the eye and 
hand as well as the ear, and question and answer succeed so sharply as to keep the 
whole class on the qui vive. ‘ 
“There is absolutely no compulsion in the selection of methods. Every 
teacher has the greatest possible liberty in the selection of the methods ~ 
of teaching. No inspector (or superintendent) prescribes methods; 
all he would dare to do is to suggest improvements here and there. 
Since the state attends to the professional training of the teachers, it can 
safely leave teachers to their own devices, trusting in their professional 
spirit and ambition. : 
The branches of study.—Religion: This instruction is nonsectarian in 
character, but Protestant, Catholic, and Israelites are, as much as pos- 
sible, taught in separate schools.' Where they attend mixed schools 
they are separated during the lesson in religion. It must be re- 
membered that in Prussia church and state are not separated as in | 
America; hence the prominence given to religious instruction. Bibli- 
cal history, catechism with Bible verses, memorizing of hymns, essen- 
tial points of religious ethics and the creed, are what the public schools 
are required to teach. Language and reading: Familiarity with the 
mother tongue and a limited knowledge of German literature are, 
broadly speaking, the sum total of attainable results. Penmanship and 
drawing: As a rule the penmanship of the pupils is commendable. In 
drawing particularly rapid progress has been made of late. The ex- 
ercises chiefly consist of ornamental drawing and form studies. In the 
higher grades drawing of solids and modelling is practiced. Arithme- 
tic: This study is less extended than in American schools, but very

tary but are pursued with the aid of simple, and sometimes home-made, 
apparatus, Gymnastics: Physical exercises are prescribed in the 
course, .and no school is without suitable apparatus for regular exer- 
cise. Manual training for boys is not prescribed officially, but private : 
efforts in this direction are greatly encouraged and even subsidized by 
the government. Industrial education for girls consists in knitting 
crocheting, embroidering, sewing, darning, cutting, fitting, and pateh-

Hence Jess than one-half of the Prussian children were enrolled in 
graded schools ; about one-third in entirely ungraded schools. ' 
Privy-Councilor Dr. Schneider, director of the Bureau of People’s 
Schools in the Department of Education in Berlin, attached to these — 
official figures the opinion: 
It is an undisputed fact that the ungraded schools, manned as they are with well- 
trained graduates of normal,schools, accomplish very satisfactory results. * * * 
Skill, endurance, and professional zeal, and last, but not least, the greater physical 
strength of their teachers, are naturally of beneficial influence. It is well to remem- _ 
ber, then, that the graded city school is not, under all cireumstances, and hence should. 
not, brevi manu, be considered the better school. 
There is less of grading in Prussian schools than is commonly ex- 
pected, and it is omitted purposely, for it is considered detrimental to 
have an entire class of pupils sifted by means of examinations till they : 
are to all intents and purposes alike in knowledge and skill. There are 
always two, if not more, classesin one room. As regards examinations 
of pupils, much less is done in Germany than in this country ; compe- 
tition is considered demoralizing, and premotions are in many instances. 
determined by the teacher’s decision. In Saxony and other states of 
Germany school examinations are held annually and made public. 
They really consist in a review of what the class was designed to have 
gone over during the year. Nowhere, except in the upper grades of 
high schools, are written examinations held. The decision of the teacher 
is rarely questioned; being a professional man, he is expected to know 
his business. it would as little occur to a German to question the 
official acts of the teacher as to question the judgment of his medical 
adviser, : 
Discipline.—Ever since the establishment of schools in Germany 
discipline has been strict. It is based upon the presumption that rey- 
erence for elders and obedience to the superiors of the children must be 
expected, and if wanting must be enforced. There being greater docility 
on the part of German children, harsh measures are not resorted to as 
frequently as it is commonly believed. No law exists prohibiting cor- 
poral punishment, but it is well understood that extreme cases are met 
and dealt with severely by the functionaries of the law.

IX.—SUPPLEMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. Ne 
The people’s schools are supplemented in the most ideal manner by 
variety of institutions which tend to relieve the schools and make them 
‘more effective. , | 
(1) Schools for dullards.—Children who are weak-minded, but not 
idiots, and who retard the progress of the pupils in the elementary 
schools, are gathered in special classes, where they are treated with due 
consideration and educated to become useful members of society. ‘Such 
schools are found only in industrial centers, however. 
(2) Asylums for vagrants.—Poor parents, working in factories, have 
little chance for watching their children at home; hence Knabenhorte 
‘are established, in which the boys spend their unoccupied afternoons 
and evenings in manual labor, play, singing, and drawing. The fees 
are nominal. These institutions are private, but have the encourage- 
ment of the government. | 
. (3) Continuation schools, which may be either day or evening schools, 
_or, a8 in some places, Sunday schools. These schools are in fact post- 
(4) The state maintains reform schools for boys and girls, asylums for |. 
the blind, dea/-mutes, orphans, and idiots—and in fact for all of Nature’s

unfortunates. It is not necessary to enter into their organization and 
management, because they differ little, if at all, from similar institutions 
in this country. It suffices to say that old nations, like the German, 
have a considerably larger number of children with defective sense 
organs than the American; a fact which is readily understood if the 
natural conditions of life in Anasipe are considered. | 
Industrial schools, trade schools, and other similar special institutions, 
such as agricultural schools, which tend to perfect what the elementary 
school has begun, should be mentioned here. Besides these supplemen- 
tary institutions, societies and institutions for scientific purposes aid the 
work of the schools. Thus, for instance, all classes and kinds of schools 
of a city stand in close connection with and intimate relation to the 
management of art academies, museums, zodlogical and botanical gar- 
dens, the astronomical observatory, the library, gymnastic societies, f 
and even the theater; in fact, with every institution which in some de- 
gree may be influential in assisting the work in schools. 
Plants are ordered for the study of botany at the botanical gardens. 
Certain hours are fixed at the zodlogical gardens for visits of the classes 
in zodlogy; admission is free. Classes in drawing are taken to the art 
collections and museums, where theteacher of advanced classes gives a 
lesson monthly. The libraries are open to the pupils on presentation 
of a membership ticket issued by the rector of the school. Classes in 
literature go with their teachers to see classic performances in the 
theaters. The schools having small but very valuable collections, 
frequently exchange specimens with the curator of the museum, or even 
make loans. And so to every department of the curriculum some in- 
stitution outside of the school offers assistance free of charge. 
The more one looks about himself in Germany, the more one is im- 
pressed with the fact that the whole nation is one great educational 
institution. Churches have their reserved seats for school children ; 
theaters offer classical performances for students; gardens and parks 
are open for children; gymnastic halls and apparatus are provided for 
the use of pupils of the city schools; in fine, all efforts are made to 
put public instruction upon a national basis, and to make the desire 
for education contagious. 
X.—VARIETY IN SCHOOL ORGANIZATION IN GERMANY, AUSTRIA, 
HUNGARY, AND SWITZERLAND. 
From the foregoing it would seem as though the so-called Volks- 
Schule (people’s school), or more properly speaking, elementary school, 
is the main institution of learning for the people. This impression is — 
erroneous. In the cities of Prussia, but more particularly in those of 
Saxony and other states, the authorities give a wider scope to their ele- 
mentary schools. Outside of Germany the word Volks Schule has a 
different meaning and frequently stands for pauper school, while the

i schools. The citizens’ school of Prussia, on the other hand, is   
89, ae hla 
Birger Schule (citizens? school) is a ohivl almost identical with the 
common school in the United States. 
Leipsic and Dresden, in Saxony, have furnished the types of sn 
ery 
much akin to our American city high school, and must be olaaked among 
the secondary schools; hence it is not mentioned in the preceding 
pages. If we consider the fact that the people’s schools of Prussia had 
5,173,627 pupils in 1887, while all the middle and high schools (citizens’ 
schools, girls’ academies, real-schulen, and gymnasia) had only 357,000 
students with about 300 ,000 in preparatory classes, the preéminence 
given to the people’s aoncle’} is fully justified. 
Switzerland, though quite independent of Germany politically, in- 
a ‘dustrially, and socially, is in a large degree imitating its two neighbors, 
_ Germany and France. The German system of religious instruction 
and the French system of secular instruction are blended in the Swiss 
' schools. Altogether there is more instability in the Swiss schools than 
in the German, owing to the fact that each canton manages its own 
schools. “Chere is no centralization. It is the American mode of self- 
government in miniature. This is evident from the following. 
As regards the object of the public schools there are in the different 
cantonal school laws two ideas that may be defined as meaning “edu- 
cation in the widest sense” on the one side, and “ mere instruction” on 
the other. Zurich says in its school law of 1832, “the children ss all 
classes of society shall be educated according to the well-defined princi- 
ples of pedagogy, to be intellectually active, civilly useful, and morally   good men and women.” Similar definitions are found in the constitu- 
tions of Baselland (1835), Zug (1850), Graubiinden (1853), Bern (1856), 
Aargau (1865), Wallis (1873), Appenzell (1875), Schwyz (1877), Nidwal- 
den (1879), Schaffhausen (1879). Obwalden (1876), on the contrary, 
simply says, “it is the duty of every community to see to it that its 
children by attending a primary school shall acquire the knowledge for 
common life.” Lucerne (1879) says, “the primary and continuation 
schools have the object to offer youth a general culture such as life de- 
mands.” Baselstadt (1880) says, ‘the primary school has the object 
to. make the children familiar with elementary knowledge.” Eleven 
- cantons, among which are Geneva and Freiburg, do not define the ob. 
ject of the public school at all. 
As regards German Austria little need be said to characterize the 
schools save that they resemble the schools of Germany in organization, 
mode of maintenance, management, and results. There are agencies 
at work, however, depending chiefly upon the different degree of cul- 
ture of the people, differences in the appreciation of public instruc. 
tion, individual predilections, and tendencies of the ruling men in the | 
government at different times, that cause varieties, changes, and mod. 
- ifications which will in. due course of time produce considerable differ- 
entiation, At present it can not be said to be very great.

_ Among the continental schools in Europe there seem to be, to the 
- eareful observer, two trends noticeable: one the Germanic, the other the 
Romanic. The former insists upon thorough discipline of mind and body 
and the fostering of a deep religious and moral sense, and in order to 
facilitate this, the following are considered necessary: (a) considera- 
tion for the feelings of all citizens in religious matters; (b) local gov- 
ernment, including regulation of religious instruction (subject to the 
protection of minorities); (c) direct local taxation, expenditure and ad- 
ministrative details; (d) religion, subject to certain conscience clause 
provisions, considered the basis of instruction; (e) compulsory attend. 
ance; (f) thorough, qualification of all teachers for private as well 
as for public schools; (g) recognition of the importance of gymnastic 
exercises. ; ; 
The special features of the Romanic trend are: (a) the natural eager 
intention to render the system as perfect as possible, and in as short a 
time as possible; (b) in pursuance of that intention munificent expendi- 
ture upon public instruction is made; (c) the absence of any religious — 
instruction is a marked characteristic, but the system endeavors to be 
absolutely neutral in, and not hostile to, religion; (d) special attention 
is paid to industrial training; (e) the organization of infant schools is 
very complete; (f)*the state far more absolutely than elsewhere con- 
trols the complete education of the people.

A few facts concerning the Hungarian schools should be added to 
complete the exposition of the German schools, for the Hungarian 
schools are to a great extent organized like the schools in Germany 
and Austria. 
In 1888 Hungary had 2,416,945 children of school age, 6 to 15 years. 
Of these only 1,950,879, or 80.73 per cent., attended elementary schools, 
namely, 1,750,013 between 6 and 12 years of age, and 666,932 between 
12 and 15 years of ‘age. Here is an instructive comparison :

* Count Csaky, the new minister of education in Hungary, considers 
>it his duty to regulate the affairs of preschoiastic institutions, such as 
kindergarten, infant schools, etc. In his first report, just issued, he ex- 
presses his determination to establish elementary schools wherever the | 
communities fail in so doing, and he urges that the salaries and pen- 
sions of teachers be regulated by law. 
Among the new steps he has taken, we mention an order according 
to which courses have been arranged for female teachers in normal 
schools, also courses for training professors for secondary schools, so ‘ 
that henceforth the graduates of universities who wish to devote them- 
selves to teaching may obtain their professional training before enter- — 
ingupon their duties. : 
The salaries of teachers have hitherto been paid irregularly. The 
minister insists upon it that they be paid promptly. Also in regard to 
_ the chaos prevailing in Hungarian schools in the use of text-books he 
. promises wholesome changes. 
Since the passage of the present school law in 1869, the number of 
_ schools has increased 2,824. Hungary has now 16,622 schools, among 
- which are 16,301 elementary, 74 advanced, 13 girls’ schools, 159 citizens’ 
schools. The state supports only 738 schools, communities 1,880, the 
religious congregations 13,783; 202 were private schools; 10,712 towns 
_ or villages have their own schools, 1,783 have joined others in so-called 
combined schools, and 300 settlements or villages have no school at all. 
Of 1,000 German children of school age in Hungary, 907 were in 
_ school; of 1,000 Slavonians, 850; of 1,000 Magyars, 842; of 1,000 Croa- 
> tians, 858; of 1,000 Servians, 802; of 1,000 Ruthenians, 675; of 1,000 Rou- 
manians, 622. The number of teachers increased from 17,782 in 1869, 
to 24,148 in 1887. At present there are 71.72 children to the teacher. 
Of the 24,188 teachers, 3,133 (or 13 per cent.) have no certificate. The 
apy Eh number of women teachers has increased 340 per cent. since 1869. 
There are at present 71 normal schools (46 in’ 1869); of these 25 were 
" state schools, 46 confessional schools; 53 were for men, 17 for women.

“SCHOOLS OF GERMANY, AUSTRIA, AND SWITZERLAND. 169 
XII.—SECONDARY SCHOOLS AMONG GERMAN-SPEAKING NATIONS. 
Variety in organization and scope.—The lower schools of Germany, 
Austria, and Switzerland, as well as of Hungary, are, as has been stated 
before, not common schools in the sense in which that term is under- 
stood in the United States, free of charge and common to all, but of a 
variety of types. This differentiation is even more pronounced in the 
higher schools. The variety found among them is so great that it puz- 
zies the collector of statistics who has to classify them. Switzerland, 
wedged in between monarchies, has to accommodate itself to demands 
made by society, hence we find even there a great variety of schools, 
though not as confused as in Germany and Austria. 
_ Biirgerschulen (citizens? schools), hdhere médchenschulen, progymnasia,. 
gymnasia, realschulen, realgymnasia, prorealgymnasia are the public 
high schools. This array of technical terms is difficult to render in 
English. A verbal translation would be misleading, and a labored 
circumlocution useless. These secondary schools may be grouped into 
middle and high schools. The citizens’ school, girls’ academy, and the 
progymnasium (which is a gymnasium with incomplete course) may be 
classed among the middle schools. The gymnasium, realschule (with 
complete course), and the realgymnasium are the high schools. The 
gymnasium is the oldest of all secondary schools, and is the Latin school 
of the Middle Ages. It is the classical boys’ school par emcellence. 
The realschule (the first one was established 140 years ago) substitutes 
modern languages for the classics, and bestows much attention upon nat- — 
ural sciences, mathematics, and industrial drawing and designing. The 
gymnasium prepares for the learned professions, the realschule trains 
éngineers, surveyors, artists, civil officers, ete. Therealgymnasium isa- 
combination of both kinds of schools, and found nearly always where 
a community can not support two secondary schools. From the charts 
(see pp. 173-6) the differences existing between the courses of these 
schools may be gleaned better than from verbal explanation. The great 
army of business men is recruited from these higher and from the 
middle schools. The boy of the people’s school has a hard time of it in 
courting success in the higher walks of life; still such cases are by no - 
means wanting. 
Statistics of secondary schools in Prussia.—In 1889, Germany had 418 
gymnasia (or classical schools), namely, Prussia, 266; Bavaria, 35; 
Saxony, 17; Wiirtemberg, Baden, 14; Hessen, 7; Mecklenburg- 
Schwerin, 7; Braunschweig, 6; Oldenburg, 5; Anhalt 4; Saxe- Weimar, 
3; Mecklenburg-Strelitz, 3; Alsace-Lorraine, 16; the other German 
principalities, 1 or 2 each. These institutions are distributed over the 
empire very irregularly, as is seen from the following figures: While 
in Saxony 187,000 inhabitants support 1 gymnasium, there is 1 to every 
133,000 inhabitants in Wiirtemberg; 1 to every 114,000 inhabitants 
in Baden; 1 to 107,000 in Prussia; 1 to 100,000 inhabitants in Alsace- ma 
   
-P-A-G-E-240
      “ EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. i eae ne a 
Lorraine. In other parts of the empire 60, 000 and even 33,000 inhabi- 
tants support and maintain'a gymnasium. In 18389, Gorinany had 54 
progymnasia (6 years’ instead of 8 years’ COURSE Of these, 40 were 
found in Prussia. 
  The number of realgymnasia was 133 in 1889. Of these Prussia had 
90; Saxony, 10; Bavaria, 5; Hessen, 4, etc. There were, besides these, 
106 real-progymnasia, and 15 upper realschulen. These schools are 
found chiefly in Prussia, namely, 84 real-progymnasia and 10 upper 
~ realschulen. These two kinds of schools do not differ materially in aims 
- and scope. The number of realschulen and higher citizens’ schools in 
1889 was 154, These two kinds of schools do not differ much, either. 
_ Of these 154 schools, Prussia had only 39, while Bavaria had 33; Sax- 
ony, 20; Hessen, 14; Baden, 11; Alsace-Lorraine, 10; Wiirtemberg, 
10; the other states,17. To these different classes of secondary schools 
should be added 87 public and private institutions, which it is difficult 
to classify. Hence, the entire number of acknowledged secondary 
schools in Germany in 1889 was 976. Before long Germany will have 
a thousand high schools that are high schools in fact, as well as in 
  name. 
In all the South German states and in Alsace-Lorraine secondary 
instruction is exclusively the state’s concern. Communal gymnasia, 
_ realschulen, and higher citizens’ schools are not found in Bavaria, Wiir- _ 
temberg, Baden, and Hessen, nor in Alsace-Lorraine. In Prussia, the — 
majority of gymnasia are state schools, but there are still a number of 
municipal schools of that kind. Their number decreases, however, 
every year, since the state takes hold of them as its means increase. 
Nearly all the other schools, that is, those which depart from mere 
classical learning and emphasize scientific and mathematical studies, , 
and particularly modern languages, are municipal institutions. Thus 
it appears that, in Prussia the state fosters classical, the city, modern edu- 
cation. 
The salaries of teachers in the high schools of Germany are highest — 
in wealthy cities: Hamburg (maximum, $2,160), Lubeck (maximum, 
$1,575), Anhalt (maximum, $1,500), Frankfort (maximum, $1,540), 
Berlin (maximum, $1,500). The pensions paid to teachers in high 
' schools are highest in Bavaria, Hessen, Wiirtemberg, Saxe-Weimar, 
_ and others of the small principalities. 
The following data are interesting: In Bavaria the pension amounts 
to 70 per cent. of the salary after 10 years of service, 80 per cent. of ~ 
the salary after 25 years of service, 90 per cent. of salary after the 40 
years of service, 100 per cent. of the salary after 50 years of service. 
In Hessen 50 per cent. of the salary after 10 years of service, 72.5 
per cent. of the salary after 25 years of service, 90 percent. of the 
salary after 40 years of service. In Saxony 334 per cent. of the salary 
after 10 years of service, 41.5 per cent. of the salary after 25 years of 
service, 70 per cent. of the salary after 40 years of service. In Saxony

SCHOOLS OF GERMANY, AUSTRIA, AND SWITZERLAND. 
the government has released the cities from contributing to the pen- 
sion fund and intends to assume all paying of pensions to teachers. 
An increase in the schools is confidently expected. 
Stimulus for higher education of boys—When we consider the fact 
that Prussia with 28,000,000 inhabitants has 356,912 pupils in second- 
ary schools, it is obvious that some powerful stimulus to higher educa- 
tion must exist in that country. Mere love of learning would not 
adequately account for the high percentage of youths seeking a higher 
intellectual plane. The motive isfound in the fact that, by govern- 
mental decree, students who have passed through a six years’ high school 
course are entitled to an abbreviation of their military service from 
three years to one year. Hence, continuing his studies tillhe reaches 
the “secunda” (the class below the graduating class), the youth se- 
cures not only a better education generally, but shortens his service in 
the army by two years. This system of artificially inducing the young 
men of the country to stay in schoollonger than they would otherwise 
do has been in existence for over 30 years; it has proven beyond 
doubt the most effective inducement for higher education, though it has 
its bitter opponents, and lately the government is contemplating its 
abolishment because the number of young men with a secondary edu- 
eation isso rapidly increasing that all the learned professions are over- 
crowded with candidates, and a new social species is being developed, 
_ that of “educated paupers.” 
Graduates,—Prussia furnishes some instructive data concerning the 
number and choice of occupation of graduates of gymnasia or classical 
schools. p 
In 1889 266 gymnasia conducted examinations for graduation; 4,251 
pupils signified their willingness to submit to the examination, but 
shortly before the day arrived 307 withdrew from the contest, and 93 
were refused admission by the faculty, reasons not stated. Of the re- 
maining 3,851 who were examined, 3,702 passed, 149 failed. Six of ’ 
those who passed were less than 17 years old; 98 were 17; 579 were 
18; 972 were 19; 959 were 20; 1,088 were 21 or more. Six hundred 
and sixteen of the graduates went to universities to study Protestant 
theology, 326 Catholic theology, 12 Hebrew theology; 703 went to study 
law; 29 political economy; 873 medicine ; 210 philology and philosophy; 
109 mathematics and natural sciences. Some, especially the youngest | 
ones, had not decided what course of study to pursue. Two hundred 
and thirty-nine went to military academies with the view to entering 
the army; 110 will devote themselves to civil engineering; 33 to min- 
ing engineering ; 270 intend to enter forestry, postal, and state civil — 
service; 130 will go to farming, commerce, and industrial pursuits; 37 
to other callings. Sey 
Austria had in 1889 172 gymnasia (classical schools for boys) with 
55,404 students, 85 realschulen (modern high schools for boys). with 
18,545 students; 178 of these secondary schools were supported ex: ! 4m.

The four accompanying charts illustrate the differences in the courses 
of study in the various schools of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, 
as well asin the common schools of America. A comparison of these 
charts will afford an insight into the differentiation going on in these 
schools in order to meet the different demands of life. (See pp. 173-6.) 
On these charts, it must be understood, the course of study for the 
American common school is an average course, such as may be found 
with slight deviations ali over the country. It does not indicate any 
preferences in favor of this, that, or another language, and leaves the 
limit of time spent in the study of grammar undefined, but shows that 
much time is consumed in mastering the orthography of the English 
language. It is scarcely necessary for the reader in this country to see 
minutely delineated what by a slow. process of evolution has become 
the average course of study. Of course, if a selection were made here 
and in Europe among the schools, we might present a picture which 
would make a just comparison quite impossible. Statistics is the science 
of averages, and it is the average school, not the exception, which is — 
here delineated. The courses of the Prussian schools sketched in the 
accompanying charts show the leading features of language instruction 
and the relative value bestowed upon it in the different kinds of 
schools, 
These charts are the result of comparison of many courses of study 
in use in Germany, and of the requirements made by the Prussian Goy- 
ernment, notably by the decree of May 31, 1882. 
  
“1 The number of secondary estou in Hungary is 180, namely, 151 gymnasia, 29 
realschulen. In 120 of these secondary schools the medium of instruction is the 
Hungarian language, in 39 it is another language mixed with Hungarian, in 21 it is 
either German, Croatian, Roumanian, ete. The number of students in secondary 
schools was in 1888, 39,918, or 615 more than in 1887. Of these 32,255 attended gym- 
nasia, 6,563 realschulen. According to their mother tongue the students are 
classified as Hungarians, 28,487 (71,3 per cent.), Germans, 6,285 (15.8 per cent.), Rou- 
manians, 2,456 (6.2 per cent.), Italians, 123 (0.3 per cent.), Slavonians, 1,542 (3.9 per 
cent.), Servian-Croatic 810 (2.0 per cent.), Ruthenians, 97 (0.2 per cent.), others 118 
(0.3 per cent.). Another interesting fact is brought out, if we ask for the number of 
students who speak only their mother tongue : 16,967 students speak only Hungarian, 
338 only German, 569 only Roumanian, 11 only Slavonian, 83 only Servian-Croatic. 
Hence 18,002 (or 45 per cent.) speak only their mother tongue, while 21,916 (or 55 per 
cent.) speak two or more languages.

@The items in this column are estimates for the year 1888, furnished by the government. b Annnal intere=t. eighteen per cent. of this sum is contributed by the state. aThere are in Prussia a great number of special schools, both state er communal and private. Where the state is unable to give pecuniary support, it aids these institutions morally and solicits the aid of those of its citizens interested in their existence. Prussia has the greatest varicty of special schools, ‘dutno definite statistics are available. i'rom tho large sum spent for the maintenance of such schools itis obvious, however, that the statement made by an American author, to wit, “Prussia has the greatest number of educational experimental stations of any nation on the faco of the globe,” is not an exaggeration. 3 31.05 per cent, of this sum total is contributed by the state, 46.19 per cent, by communities, 22.76 per cent. are raised by tuition fees and obtained from sundry other sources. The expenditure for educational purposes in 1838 in Prussia was $1.86 per capita of the population. 
(Compare Switzerland, where tho per capita was $1.88, and Hungary where it was 42 cents.)

INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT. 
The territory known to-day as Italy has been subjected to the domi- - 
nation of Germany, Spain, France, and Austria at different periods 
of its history. Spanish rule predominated during the sixteenth and 
seventeenth centuries; Austrian at the beginning of the eighteenth;

The executive power of the state belongs exclusively to the sovereign, 
and is exercised by him through responsible ministers. The legisla- 
tive authority is vested in the King, the Senate, and the Chamber of 
Deputies. 
The local government is administered by the provincial and commu- 
nal councils, each provinee having a provincial council and a provincial 
commission ; each commune a communal council, a municipal council, 
and a syndic. 
The administrative and educational authorities are brought closely 
together in their duties, as is shown in the statement appended. The 
state, province, or commune maintains public instruction; a member of 
the cabinet is in charge of education; the King himself appoints cer- 
tain grades of instructors; the parliamentary bodies discuss and decide 
upon educational questions ; the prefect of the province is president of 
the provincial school council; the syndic looks after the registration of 
pupils of school age, notifies parents of neglect of duty, ete. 
The organization of the public school system in Italy is based on the 
law of November 13, 1859, called the “ Legge Casati,” from the minister 
in charge of education at thatdate. This law, which was intended more 
especially for the schools of Piedmont, Sardinia, and Lombardy, is under 
a united Italy the basis of all later laws appertaining to the school sys- 
tem. Its main features may be gleaned in the following presentation. 
I.—GENERAL FEATURES OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM. 
The state regulates public instruction, and maintains, either entirely 
or in conjunction with the communes and provinces, public schools of 
every grade. It also authorizes the establishment of private schools, 
among which are classed those conducted by religious corporations.) At 
1 By law of 1867 all chapters of collegiate churches, abbeys, ecclesiastical benefices 
not attached to parishes, and all brotherhoods and foundations to which an ecele- 
siastical service was annexed, were suppressed. The property was transferred to the 
state under certain regulations. A great part was devoted to education. Religious 
corporations not being recognized by law, the schools carried on by them became of 
a private character. In addition to these schools there are also lay private schools,

184 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
the head of the school system is the minister of public instruction, who 
is assisted by a higher council of education. Another general council 
has special control of secondary and elementary instruction. The local 
control of schools is vested*in a council of education for éach of the 
sixty-nine provinces under the presidency of the prefect, which has the 
right of supervision in regard to the sanitary and moral state of the 
provincial schools. (For other school officers with their special duties 
see “supervision” below.) 
The divisions of the school system are: (1) Elementary, which in- 
eludes infant schools, primary of two grades, and normal schools; (2) 
secondary education, which includes classical and technical schools; 
(3) higher education, including the universities, higher institutes, and 
special schools. 
The elementary grades and technical schools are maintained by the 
communes; the lower grade secondary classical schools by the munici- 
palities ; the higher grade classical schools, i. ¢., the “licei,” by the state 
and the municipalities; the technical institutes and the higher special 
schools by the state, provinces, and communes. The universities are 
maintained by the state and by their own ancient revenues,

  Norz.—Per cent. of population enrolled in schools: Elementary education, 9 per cent.; secondary education, 0.6 per cent.; higher education, 0.5 per cent. , The “ asili infantili,” or infant schools, are conducted after the Aporti method (founded by the Ab. __ Fk 
bate Ferranti Aporti in 1847), that is “un poco troppo scuola e troppo pocco asilo,” but acertain num- © | ber are conducted according to Froebel’s kindergarten system. é ‘The ‘‘scuola irregolare” do not fulfil all requirements of the law in point of study and time of com- _ ‘ mencement. 3 The “scuole normale,” inferiore © superiore, are for the training of teachers, the former having a two'years’ conrse, the latter extending through three years. The classical schools—ginnasi and licei—lead to the aniversities and learned professions. To sub-_ 
serve the necessities of modern life the ‘‘scuole tecniche”’ and ‘‘istituti tecnici” were established. 
‘The ‘“scuole tecniche” prepare pupils for industrial or commercial pursuits; the “'istitnti tecnici” ny for the professions of civil engineering, surveying, ete. a ‘The “conyitti” connected with secondary schools are establishments where pupils are boarded and 
lodged, and within which are schools of an elementary charactor, preparing pupils for classical or technical schools. ‘‘ Conyitti” fur girls prepare for higher institutes for that sex. 
‘The universities are classed as free and governmental, the free universities being supported by the s 
municipalities or by their own funds. Under higher institutes, or schools which codperate with the 
universities, are classed the Institute for the Perfecting of Higher Studies in Florence, the normal 
school at Pisa, the scientific and literary academy and the higher technical school of Milan, the royal school of medicine and surgery, etc. Special schools include agricultural and mining schools, industrial and commercial schools, conserva- 
tories of music, etc.   
    
     
  
  
II.— FINANCES, 
Income.—The funds for public schools are made up from amounts 
derived from the state, from provincial and local taxation, and in the 
communes, from revenues derived from the “ opere pie” or foundations, 
and by tuition fees. The amount from revenues and from taxation is not 
known, but the funds as a whole in 1886 were: State, $7,189,061 5 
provincial funds, $1,008,807; communal funds, $12,014,928. Total, 
$20,212,796. 
Bupenditures.—The expenditures, subdivided as to grades of educa- 
tion are not to be obtained for the year 1886. The total expended by 
the state, provinces, and communes together was $19,001,341 at that 
date. The state expenditures are usually applied to making up defi- 
ciences in teachers’ salaries; provincial subsidies to defraying the cost 
of school buildings, furniture, and similar material expenditure; com- 
muunal funds to the general support of elementary schools,

or “ mandamenti.” The provincial school council is composed of the 
prefect of the province, who presides ; of the provincial supervisor of 
studies, who acts as vice president; and of ten councillors. This council” 
has'the supervision of elementary, normal, technical, and classical edu- 
cation. It examines school laws and regulations, approves the budget 
for public schools, sanctions appointment of teachers, gives its opinion 
in regard to subsidies to the communes and to teachers, watches over — 
private schools (the inspection of private schools covers hygiene and 
morals, but is not extended to the course of study) and in every way 
acts as representative of the minister of public instruction in the. 
province. 4 
The Provveditore has special charge of classical, technical, son nor- 
mal schools, He acts asa link between the provincial council, the | 
schools, and the minister. District school inspectors attend to the needs 
of the elementary schools, which they visit twice a year. A certificate of 
capacity is required, since 1881, of persons desiring to become district 
school inspectors. The delegates of the ‘ mandamenti” are nonsalaried ~ 
officials appointed by the King for three years. Their duties are to~ 
represent the provincial school council and watch over the elementary 
and secondary schools. ; 
’ 
V.—TEACHERS. 
The teachers of the Kingdom are trained in normal schools, “ scuole’ 
normale;” which are of two grades, higher and lower. These schools, — 
133 in number, with 10,542 pupils in 1886, are divided into govern- | 
mental, provincial, communal, endowed, private, and not assimilated, 
“non pareggiate,” that is, those which arrange their own Conse: 
' classify their own studies, etc. 
The courses in the lower grade normals, which were called “seuole 
magistrale” until 1883, are two yearsin duration. Those in the higher 
grade normals are three years. The applicants for admission to the 
normal schools must have attained, men the sixteenth year, women 
the fifteenth year. They must be able to pass a partly verbal and — 
partly written examination in grammar, arithmetic, catechism, and 
Bible history, and must possess a certificate of high moral standing. 
They are also required to have a physician’s certificate, showing good — 
physical condition. 
Teachers also have the advantage of teachers’ institutes and associa.» 
tions for the discussion of methods, school management, salaries, ete. 
Applicants for teachers’ positions in elementary grades must be — 
eighteen years of age, and must hold the required certificate of capac. 
ity and morality. Normal pupils desiring teachers’ positions in the 
lower grade require the certificate indicating completion of the two : 
            
 
-P-A-G-E-260
    188 " EDUCATION. REPORT, 1888-89. i 
years’ course. Jor the higher grade positions the diploma for the three 
years’ course is required. ‘To obtain a certificate as teacher in the lower 
grade elementary schools, normal pupils are required to pass an exami- 
nation in the following obligatory branches: catechism and Bible his- 
tory, Italian language, reckoning and the metric system, pedagogics 
and penmanship. To obtain a diploma as normal teacher for the higher 
grade elementary schools the obligatory branches are religion, compo- 
sition, history of literature, arithmetic and book-keeping, elements 
of geometry and natural sciences, history, geography, pedagogies, 
and penmanship. Teachers are appointed by the communal council 
subject to the approval of the provincial council. eo appointment is 
usually for two years, but a probationary six months’ period is some-_ 
times required. To receive a permanent appointment the teacher 
must be twenty-two years of age, prior to that the appointment is re- 
newed from year to year. Examinations for teachers’ positions are 
held annually in the normal centers. 
In private schools teachers must have the certificate required by law, 
and in private schools of a secondary grade they must be at Jeast 
_ twenty-five years of age. The representative of the minister in the 
province sanctions the appointment of private school teachers. To teach 
in Sunday or holiday schools no certificate is necessary, but there are 
certain requirements to be fulfilled before a person can obtain such 
position. ‘ 
_ The minimum salary of teachers in rural schools, by law of 1859, 
was not to be less than $96; in city schools, $135. Later laws modi- 
fied this rate, and in May, 1885, Minister Coppino presented a bill to 
the Chamber of Deputies in which the salaries in higher city schools 
were not to be less than $193, women $156; in the higher grades of 
rural schools the minimum to be $152, women $123. In the lower 
grades the annual salary was less. By law of 1886 the salaries in the 
rural schools were to range from $140 to $180 for men, from $112 to 
$144 for women; in city schools from $180 to $264 for men, and from 
$144 to $211 for women. The subjcct of teachers’ salaries is freely dis- 
cussed each year, and an amelioration of the teacher’s condition is 
earnestly desired. 
In the secondary classical schools the professors are called titular and 
regent ; the former appointed by the King when recommended by the 
minister, the latter by the minister. The titular professor is selected by 
competition from persons who have obtained the degree of university 
doctor in the science or department of study for which he is competing, 
or he must hold other legal certificate. The regent may be appointed 
without previous examination, if a graduate of a normal, but he can 
not become a titular professor without examination, The salaries of 
i these professors range as follows: Ginnasi, or lower grade classical 
ot schools, $309 to $386; licei, or higher grade, $387 to $425. Teachers in 
technical schools and institutes are selected as they are in the classical 
schools, excepting that on account of haste in organization of technical

education competitive examinations were omitted. The salaries vary 
in the state, communal, and private institutions. 
The university professors are divided iuto ordinary and extraordinary 
professors. The former are appointed by the King, the latter by the 
minister. A competitive examination before a commission appointed 
by the higher council of education, or the handing in of printed theses, 
is required to show the aptitude of the candidate for the position de- 
sired. The extraordinary professors are only appointed for the course, 
anda new appointment is required if they desire to continue in service. 
The salaries of the professors in the principal universities are placed at 
$1,158 after ten years’ service, and at $965 for less time than that. , At. 
the minor universities the salaries range from $579 to $694.! 
Teachers’ pensions were allowed by law, but this enactment did not 
go into force until January, 1889. 
VI.—COURSES OF STUDY. 
Elementary schools.—The instruction in the infant schools tends to — 
develop the body of the child by gymnastic exercises appropriate to its 
age, to inculcate moral teachings, by example, to occupy the child’s 
time with games rather than book knowledge. The teacher endeavors 
to develop both body and mind and, in a measure, to exercise a mater- 
nal influence over the child. 
The kindergarten—the first one in Italy being established in Venice 
_ in 1868, by the Baroness von Marenholtz-Biilow—is gradually becom- 
ing engrafted on the school system in the larger cities, Rome and — 
‘Naples taking the lead; and a model school founded by the Baroness 
in 1871, in Florence, has been the means of educating the majority of 
directresses for such schools throughout Italy. The elementary schools 
are in two divisions. The course of study in the lower division covers 
religion (if the parents request it), reading, writing, elementary arithme- 
tic, elements.of the metric system, and the Italian language. A conple- 
tion of this course occupies two years, and ina few districts three years. 
The higher course, covered by a two years’ period, includes composi- 
tion, calligraphy, bookkeeping, the elements of geography, natural his- 
tory,and natural sciences. In the higher grades of boys’ schools the 
elements of geometry and linear drawing are taught. Private schools 
are modelled after the public schools, and the course of study is doubt- 
less similar to the above. , 
Schools of both elementary and secondary character for girls of the 
middle classes show considerable variety in their course of study. Ina 
  
1 The salaries in universities and secondary institutions may have been slightly in- 
creased since this statement was presented, as there have been numerous bills before 
the Chamber of Deputies regarding teachers’ salaries, but several of them have 
failed to become laws, consequently the above range of salary is presumed to be gor- 
rect to date, ae

- from the “liceo” is required for admission to the university. 
The technical schools, which are for boys between ten and fourteen 
years of age, have a less advanced course of study. In the three years’ 
course the studies to be pursued are Italian and oe history—an-

VIL—Scroon MANAGEMENT, 
The management of elementary: schools is left to munincipal author- 
ities, or to spécial committees chosen from the communal councillors. 
Their business is to see that the admission of pupils is properly made, 
and they are expected to visit the schools and see that the prescribed 
laws and regulations are carried out. Schools for girls are subject to 
the inspection of women inspectors who report to the provincial super- 
visor of studies. d 
Promotions take place in elementary grades at the end of six months, _ 
provided the oral and written examinations are successfully passed. 
The examinations are conducted by the teachers in the lower grade 
schools; in the upper grades teachers from other divisions are chosen. 
Text-books are ordered by the school authorities, but in secondary — 
grades, at least, the professor is allowed his own choice of books from 
among those suggested by the authorities. In matters relating to dis- 
cipline, the schoolmaster admonishes the pupil in private, or in public, or 
indicates the offense on the school register, or separates the pupil from 
his companions, or forbids his attending recitations, or suspends him 
for three days. If none of these punishments are sufficient he can 
suspend him for that year of the course, but before doingso must refér 
the matter to the official in charge of the district where the school is 
situated. 
Corporal punishment is forbidden, but other puuiadinenes such as 
standing with outstretched arms, being made to lie flat on the hard 
floor, etc., are allowed. In the higher schools of the kingdom lack of © 
discipline, neglect of duties on the part of the student, ete, are 
brought for adjustment to the higher council of education. Expulsion ~ 
is only used in extreme cases, as with the loss of diploma the student 
loses certain political rights or the power to hold governmental office. 
The formation of programs for schools is left to the minister of public 
instruction. The extent of studies to be used in schools is defined by 
him, but the teacher is not fettered by any very strict rules. 
VIII.—SCHOOL ORGANIZATION, 
The system of public schools distinguishes. between the national or 
elementary and the continuation schools. Tuition is free in the national 
schools, and every child is obliged vet attend school from three to five 
years. -

to 86 hours a week are required. The secondary schools are only open 
toboys. In regard to buildings and grounds, size of rooms, and seating 
capacity no information is presented. 
The “convitti” connected with secondary schools are separately or- 
ganized for boys and girls. They are of three kinds, national, com- 
munal, and private. The first two are managed by directors who are 
not required to have a university degree or other certificate. The pupils 
attend the public schools or are taught within the precincts of these 
establishments. The pupils are divided into classes; each class has 
a teacher who also looks after the pupil outside of school hours. No — 
class is allowed to have more than twenty pupils. These convitti are 
boarding schools preparing pupils for normal or classical training, and 
their organization seems to be similar to such preparatory schools in 
this country. f , 
The universities are organized with a rector at the head, who corre- 
sponds to our college president. He is assisted by a council composed 
of the dean of each faculty. The faculties are five in number, but the - 
free universities are minus the faculty of letters and philosophy. | To 
be admitted to university privileges a certificate of graduation from a 
      
        high grade secondary school is required. The academic year is of 95 _— 
months. These institutions are open to both sexes. The student regis- 
ters himself at the beginning of the year for the course which he intends © 
to pursue, but as in German universities he is free to follow his own in- 
clinations after this registration. He is, however, not permitted to — 
register during the year for less than eighteen hours of study a week, 
or for more than thirty hours. For the medical faculty thirty-six hours 
is the maximum. 
Special schools are too different in character for their organization to 
be given in this condensed statement. 
IX.—SUPPLEMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 
Italy has over 500 public libraries, 32 of them being subject to the an- 
thority of the state. As far back as 1877 nearly a million persons were 
reported as readers of books from these libraries. The Ambrosiana in 
Milan, with its wealth of classical and philosophical manuscripts, the 
national libraries of Turin, Naples, and Rome, count among the most im- 
portant aids to learning. The government supports thirteen academies 
and institutes of fine arts, in addition to drawing schools for workingmen, 
the picture galleries in Turin and Florence, etc. In the academies the 
professors give instruction in the fine arts, in literature and history, 
drawing from models, perspective geometry, and architecture, etching, 
lithography; history of art, etc. There are also schools for music and 
dramatic art, the conservatory of music in Milan alone costing the 
government 80,000 lire ($15,840) annually. In this institution, in addi- 
tion to full musical instruction, the professors teach poetic and dramatic

15 years) who could neither read nor write was 69 per cent. In1881 the numbers stood 
62 per cent. for the whole kingdom. The illiteracy in upper Italy was 41 per cent.; 
in middle Italy, 65 per cent.; in southern Italy, 79 per cent.; and in the islands 80 
percent. The smallest percentage of illiterates was 32 per cent., which was reported 
from Piedmont. The illiteracy in 1889 was reported for the whole kingdom as 48

INTRODUCTORY. 
In Sweden the executive power is in the hands of the King, who acts 
under advice of a council of state. The provincial administration is 
intrusted in Stockholm to a governor general, and in each of the twenty- 
four governments, to a prefect nominated by the King. The prefects are 
aided by officials termed Kronofogdar and Linsmiin, and thereisa general 
council which regulates internal affairs. Each rural parish, and each 
town, forms a commune or municipality in which all who pay local taxes 
are voters. Each commune has a communal or municipal council which 
decides on all questions of administration, ete. (Law of March 21, 1862.) 
Heclesiastical affairs and questions relating to elementary schools are 
regulated by the parish assemblies, presided over by the pastor of the 
parish. Towns having over 25,000 inhabitants, such as Stockholm, 
Goteborg, Malm6, and Norrképing, have their affairs administered sep- 
arately by municipal councils, (xxix, p. 949).

  "EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
I. Conais FEATURES OF THE ‘soHOOn SYSTEM. 
Establishment.—The school system of Sweden is established by au- 
thority of the state, and is based upon the law : 1842 which provided 
for the establishment of a stationary school, (fasta folkskola) in every 
church district or parish, or if local circumstances prevented, for the 
_ establishment of a migratory school (flyttande folkskola) in each district, 
and for the establishment of preparatory schools 
childrenin sterile or mountainous districts. Hach chief town of a diocese 
is to have a teachers’ seminary (normalskola); and since 1858, a higher 
elementary school (hégre folkskola) is obligatory in villages and dis- , 
tricts having more than 60 pupils. The secondary schools, which are” 
referred to in detail on pp. 199,200 with universities, professional schools, 
and special schools, complete the public school system. There are also 
private schoolsin towns. . These are under the general supervision of the 
board of public education. (xxv, pp. 1-9; XXvu, pp. 801, 802; Ix; x; 
XXVI, pp. 140, 141). 
State control.—The King is the highest sch (smaskolor) for young 
ol authority, and pos- 
Sesses in school matters both legislative and 
_ control of the various grades is vested in central 
secondary schools and the universities are adju sxecutive power; the

p. 2835; XXv, pp. 6-8). 
iad control.—The local iianapembi includes a school board for 
each district, which reports to the bishop and consistory i in each diocese, 
school inspectors for each diocese, and local committées. 
The cities of Stockholm, Géteborg, and Norrképing have special 
school laws, and in each of the cities a board of education has control 
of the schools. (XXvVuI, pp. 801-802; xxvI, pp. ee 145; XXv, pp. 6-8.) 
Maintenance.—Elementary schools are maintained by the district with 
help from the state. The state pays one-half* of the teacher’s salary 
and bears the expenses for the education of teachers and the payment 
of inspectors. State subsidies are also given for the purchase of school 
apparatus and school material in poor districts. The state maintains. 
public ona ps with certain subsidies to private schools of

thisgrade. It maintains the normal schools; the budget for 1886 included 
$87,752 for such schools, about $200,000 Be the universities and medi- 
cal schools, and about $100,000 for technical instruction. There are 
also special subsidies for the extension of Sléjd training, for industrial — 
museums and exhibits, and for the travelling expenses of persons who 
are making a study of industrial or technical work. (XVI, pp. 2838-9; 
XIX, p. 544; XXV, pp. 23-25; XXvI, pp. 158-159.) ; 
IL—STATISTICs. 
Bnroliment.—With a total population of 4,748,257 (in 1888), the school- 
able pupils, that is, pupils between seven and fourteen years of age,. 
were 746,768 in 1887. The number enrolled in elementary grades was 
707,959. i 
Per cent. of population enrolled in schools.—The ratio of enrollment, 
i. e., the“ inskrifna,” in these lower grades to total population was about 
15 percent. (XVIU, p. 21; Xxrx, p. 952.) 
Elementary pupils and teabhiérg. tHe number of lower éloméntary - 
schools at date of January 19, 1888, was 10,143; of these 6,940 were 
stationary (‘‘ fastafolkskolor”) and 3,203 were ‘migratory schools (“fly t- 
tande* folkskolor”). Teachers, 11,852; women, 6,922; men, 4,930. Theis 
higher people’s schools, or “ hdgre folkskolor” (established in agticul- 
tural districts for persons above the school age) numbered 23, with 870 
pupils. (xxvut, p. 21; XXrx, p. 952.) 
The city of Stockholm had (in 1886) 10 elementary communal schools 
with 14,771 pupils. Including the higher elementary grades, the num- - 
ber reached 16,514. The budget for the city schools at that date was — 
$220,454. (XVIII, p. 23.) : 
Secondary pupils and teachers.—The secondary} schools (‘hégre all- 
miinna liiroverken,” which include the “ hégre allmiinna 4 Latinlinien 
  
*It may be stated that the ambulatory or movable schocls are rendered necessary 
by the topography of the country, the many forests, hills, and lakes preventing the 
children from attendance oftentimes at the nearest stationary school. The elementary 
grades include the preparatory or smiskolor, which are established as near home as 
possible in the mountainous districts, and in which the pupils are from seven to nine 
years of age. The hégre folkskolor, or schools in agricultural districts for pupils 
above school age, are arranged so that the men attend during the winter, the women 
during the summer. In addition to elementary instruction, the students obtain 
knowledge applicable to every-day life. (xxv, pp.16,17; xvi, p. 2837; xvuuI, p, 21.) 
+ The secondary schools, imparting general information above that of the elemen- 
tary grade, are generally called “elementar liiroverken ” or elementary schools, They 
are of two kinds, the higher or complete schools with 9 classes,the lower or incomplete 
schools with 2, 3, or 5 classes. They consist. of classical and ‘‘ modern” schools, cor- 
responding in the main, the former to Latin schools and the German gymnasia; the 
latter to the German real schools. Pupils to be admitted must be nine years of age, 
and from the first class upwards there is a division in two departments. For the two — 
highest there are teachers of special subjects; a mixed system prevails in the inter- 
mediate classes. Of the 78 schools of this class only 35 are complete schools with 9 
classes, 23 have only 5 classes, the others 3 classes. A few private schools of a secon-

with 14,030 pupils. (v1, pp. 81-83 ; IX; X; XVII, p. 21; XXIX, p. 952). 
The “ pedagogier ”* or schools in smaller cities urnishing instruction 
above the “folkskola,” numbered 18, with 355 pupils. (XVI, p. 2837; _ XXIX, p. 952; xxxmIH, p. coxcrv.) 
-For normal} training there were 7 schools for men in 1887, with 722 _ pupils, and 5 “normalskolor” for women, with 51 pupils, and 2 mixed _ Schools. (Iv, p. 4; XVU, p. 1201; xrx, p. 544; XXUL, p. 715.) 
_ -Higher education.—For higher education there are the two universities -at Upsala and Lund, and the Medico-Surgical Institute at Stockholm. 
In 1888-89 there were 1,816 students at Upsala University. Divided 
as to faculties : theology, 216 ; law, 457 ; medicine, 232 ; philosophy, 911. Number of students in 1888-89 at Lund, 872. A free university at . Stockholm is reported, and in 1887 a movement was on foot to fowid a free university at Goteborg, a large sum of mo ey having been sub- 
scribed for that purpose. (Xxtv, p. 63; Xv1, p. 28 3. XXIX, pp. 952.) _ Technical instruction is given in 2 high and 4 elementary tech- nical schools. Statistics wanting for 1888. In the Kongl. Tekniska _ Hégskola i Stockholm in 1888 there were 236 ent Included under higher grade of instruction were 9 navigation schools with 438 pupils, - z _ also military schools, veterinary, and other schools. The 2 agricul- tural schools near Lund and Upsala receive state subsidies, and are. . _ under the direct control of the Academy of Agriculture in Stockholm. 
Statistics of institutions and schools for deaf-mutes will be found under “supplementary institutions. (VIO, p. 37; XVII, p. 1202; xxrx, p. 952.) 
Length of school year.—The length of the school year is 36 weeks, 
divided into autumn and spring terms; the autumn term begins at the end of August and ends about the middle of Decem er, that is, 16 weeks; the spring term continues 20 weeks from the middle of J anuary to the middle of June.

dary grade for boys are found in the larger towns. Where they are complete schools they are privileged to hold examinations similar to the public schools; if incomplete, the course is less practical. In addition to the national schools and seminaries and schools for special purposes (such as industrial arts, drawing, music, etc.) there are in most of the towns private or boarding schools for girls, only a few of which are sup- 
ported by the state.” (v1, pp. 80-85; xxv1, pp. 164-165; xxyut, p. 802.) \ * The “pedagogier” are divided into 9 one-class and 9 two-class schools, They are found in the smaller cities; the instruction given is above that of the ‘‘folkskola,” 
the main difference being that the subjects tanght are not restricted by the plan of _ instruction in elementary schools, (xxv1, p. 164; V1, pp. 80-85; XxuJ, p.714; xxxu1, p. CCXCLY. ) ; 
Bee tAccording to the decree of December 1, 1875, and of May 31, 1878, there was to be a normal school for men and one for women in each diocese—that is, 24 of these schools for the training of teachers; but in 1886 there were o ly 7 normals for men, 5 a for women, and 2 mixed schools; pupils, 1,232. Since 1878, a centralization of such tat .training has been made, and the number of these schools ha: greatly diminished, as ~ sf will be seen by the numbers given above.

School age.—The school age is seven to fourteen years, and school 
_ attendance is compulsory for children who have attained the age of nine 
years. (XXV, p. 9; XXVI, pp. 145-146.) 
TIL.— FINANCES. : 
Tncome.—The income of schools is derived from general, district, and 
personal taxation, with state subsidies given under certain conditions. 
As the elementary school is an establishment of the commune (each 
rural parish, and each town, forms a commune), each parish is presumed 
to maintain its schools of that grade, but since 1842 state subsidies aid 
in the school support. 
A general tax* (“folksskoleafgift”) is contributed by every tax-payer 
for himself and household, this tax being levied on the principle that 
each member of the community able to work should pay for the educa- 
tion of poor children. Each school district can also impose a personal 
tax, which is not to exceed 11.3 cts. annually. In addition to this taxa- 
tion the ‘state gives its help on condition that the parish pays for the 
schools a sum equal to the above-mentioned school tax, and the parish 
must also contribute a certain sum for each kind of support from the 
state. The conditions are as follows: While the state pays two-thirds 
to the higher elementary schools, the parish pays one-third. The state 
pays one-half * of the teacher’s income, the parish the other half; the 
state one-third for preparatory schools, the parish two-thirds. The 
payment of inspectors for elementary education and the normal training 
of teachers are included in the state subsidy. There are also state sub- 
sidies for the purchase of school material in poor communities and for 
the pensioning of teachers. The receipts for school purposes are also 
increased by donations for the promotion of public instruction, which 
gifts vary from year to year, (XVI, p. 2838; xvu,p.1102; xvuII, p. 20; 
XXV, pp. 22-25; XXvI, p. 158.) 
Eapenditure.—The above statement indicates how much of the fund 
for public elementary schools is accredited to the district or parish and 
how much to the state. The subsidies for the payment of teachers in 
higher elementary grades reach a maximum of $320; for certificated 
lower elementary teachers, at work during 8 months of the year, the 
maximum is $127, and for other teachers $40. The state expenditures 
for schools include public secondary schools and a few private schools 
of like grade. They include payments for the education of teachers, 
certain funds set aside for university, medical, and technical instrue- 
tion, and special subsidies for instruction in Sléjd, for industrial train- 
ing, and for the expenses of persons travelling with a view of obtain- 
  
*The following specific statements as to distribution of school funds were presented 
in 1871. Modifications may have occurred since that date, but careful research fails 
to find any marked change, except that since 1876 the subyentions were to cover two- 
thirds of the teacher's salary. ee p. 159.)

IV.—SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION. 
Education is under the control of both state and local authorities, State.—The state supervision is vested first and foremost in the King, who exercises the highest functions of the office through the* ministry of ecclesiastical affairs and education. The ministry has a special divi- sion for all affairs appertaining to publicinstruction, including the general inspection of elementary schools. The chief of that division has special charge of normal schools or seminaries for the education of eleméntary _ teachers, but the’ supervision of these schools is exercised in part by the chapter* of the diocese in which they are situated. Special in- Spectors are appointed ‘by the King to take charge o: elementary schools in each diocese. These inspectors are each appointed for a term of five years to supervise the schools in their respective districts according to   
.. “The chapters consist of the bishop, as president, and, in most cases, of the dean or provost, of the cathedral, and six teachers from the elementary schools of the town. (XII, p. 83.)

_ instructions issued by the department. They visit the schools in the 
districts to which appointed, and report to the district school board and 
consistory of the diocese as to the improvements needed in the schools. 
At the expiration of their term of office as state officers, they must fur- 
nish a complete review of school affairs in their district to the depart- 
ment of ecclesiastical affairs and public instruction. The inspectors 
receive an annual salary, and also allowance for travelling expenses 
and board. A special division of the ministry has charge of secondary — é 
and higher institutions, all matters pertaining to secondary schools be- 
ing arranged by the bureau having charge of this grade of schools. 
The chief of the bureau acts as inspector-general of all secondary schools 
in the kingdom, and must visit them from time totime. The universities 
come under direct charge of a board of council, with the chancellor of 
the Sey as chief officer. (XVI, p. 2835; XXVI, pp. 144-145; XxvII, 
p. 802; XvVUI, p. 20; X¥xur, p. 702; xxv, pp. 6-8; XLI, pp. 71-72, 87.) 
aay —There is a school board for every school district—the school 
district may be one or several parishes. This school board is com- 
posed of the minister of the parish as chairman, and at least four 
members of the parish, who are elected for four years. The board * 
superintends all the elementary and preparatory schools, devises rules 
for schools with regard to methods of instruction, discipline, ete., but 
submits its report for approval to the chapter of the bishopric of 
the diocese. It also extends its supervision over private schools as 
far as discipline and instruction are concerned, and it presents to the 
board of the diocese an annuai report in regard to schools of the | 
district (XvI, p. 2835; x1, p. 71). In connection with these local — 
boards it may be stated that in March, 1889, women were made eligi- 
ble to local school boards and boards of, guardians, and that this 
new order of things is very generally carried out (x1, p. 1; Xxx, p. 
458; xxx1, p. 45). The bishop and chapter (consistory) in every dio- 
cese exercise a careful supervision over all schools, watch over the man- 
agement and development of the same, and every third year they send 
in to the King an opinion as to the state of education in the diocese, to- 
gether with all necessary explanatory statements in regard to statistics, 
etc. Besides the school board of the district there are one or more in- 
spectors for each diocese, who are appointed by the minister of educa- 
tion. (See state supervision.) (XXVI, pp. 144-145; xxv, pp. 6-8; xL1, Pp. 
71-72.) In the cities of Stockholm, Géteborg, Malmé, Jankiohags and 
Norrképing the schools are povend by special laws; and in each of 
the cities they are under the management of a Hoard of education. 
(XXvII, p. 801.) The local management of secondary schools is under 
charge of the rector and council of teachers, who act as a board of   
* One member of this board is to be a physician, whose duty it is to visit the schools 
once a month, and to report as to health and eyesight of pupils, and in regard to. 
hygienic condition of the schools. This plan, if carried out, is an outgrowth of the — 
investigations of the Swedish hygienic commission. (xxvu1, p. 16.)

Women who are teachers in normals must have pursued their studies 
atthe “Higre Lirarinne-Seminarium och den darmed forenade nor- 
-malskola f6r flickor i Stockholm” (higher seminary for teachers and the 
normal school for girls connected with it in Stockholm), but there are 
comparatively few women instructors in the normal schools. Bach 
normal has a@ primary school of application attached to it. There are 
special masters for music, drawing, and gymnastics; a military instruc- 
tor, a professor of horticulture, and a physician* whe is instructor in 
hygiene, ete. The director has charge of the courses in religion and 
pedagogy, and Sléjdis taught by special masters at the schools of Stock-- 
holm, Kalmar, and Karlstadt, the normal school at Nais preparing them 
for stich position. (XIX, pp. 545-547.) 
Examinations.—A four years’ course with an examination at the close 
    
of each year leads to the final examination, which entitles thestudent to _ 
a certificate licentia docendi, giving the right to teach. To obtain, such — 
graduation diploma, there are both theoretical and practical examina- ° 
tions. The written compositions cover a pedagogical thesis, alessonin | 
religion, and questions in regard to the Swedish language. The oral ex- — 
amination lasts an hourin each branch. The practice lesson—the sub-_ 
ject suggested twenty-four hours previously—covers an hour and a half 
in the school of application. A year’s experience as teacher is required 
after the four years’ instruction before the candidate can become a regular 
teacher. University study and graduation diplomas from normal schools 
are both requisite in order to obtain a position as teacher ip the hégre 
elementarskolor (secondary schools), or in the normal schools. (XXyI, 
p. 153 ; XIX, pp. 546-547; xxi1, p. 713; Iv, pp. 1-38.) : 
Aenointment Be peti rules for the appoiutment of teachers are given 
in the school regulations sanctioned by the King. Teachers are ap- 
pointed to the elementary grades by the school boards, which consist 
ot the minister of the parish as chairman with four members as aids, 
if the proper normal certificate is presented. Three candidates for the 
vacant place are decided upon by the consistory of the ‘diocese, then 
the school board chooses from among thethree. The school board may § 
also require the candidate to teach for one or two days, to show whether 
he is suited to the position. In rural districts the teacher is expected 
to fill the position of organist and sexton in the parish church, and 
in such case he must be familiar with music and he must also be 
able to vaceinate or to bleed a person. To obtain an appointment as — 
teacher in the higher schools, university studies and attendance at a 
practice course in the normals are required. The consistory, that is, 
the bishop and chapter, selects three from the list of candidates and _ 
the school board appoints one of these three. For appointment in the —

fees. The private tutors receive no regular salary, but they average 
from $201 to $402 from tuition fees. (xx1I pp. 730-734.) 
Teachers’ pensions. —Teachers’ pensions are an outgrowth of a royal 
enactment of the year 1866, by which districts or communities are to 
become shareholders in a pension fund for teachers. Shares in this fund 
' are granted for amounts of notless than 500 crowns ($134), and not ex- 
ceeding 1,000 crowns ($268), and the amount paid down, not by the — 
teachers, but by the communities, is 4 per cent. of the share. The full 
pension, amounting to 75 per cent. of the share, is paid to a teacher if 
he has served thirty years and attained sixty years of age, and also if 
the applicant for the pension is afflicted with an incurable disease at 
that point of life when his age and term of service together amount to 
ninety years. Under certain circumstances a smaller pension may be: 
granted. This is determined in proportion to the whole, and paid with 
a certain percentage. (XXVI, pp. 155-6; xxv, p. 20; x11, p. 76.) 
Teachers’ institutes.—Teachers’ institutes, or educational conventions, : 
also aid in the preparation of teachers for their life work. Thenumber _ 
and extent of these associations is not known to date, but at ameeting _ 
held in Upsala in 1883 the subject of Sléjd training was under discussion, 
and at a meeting of teachers in August, 1888, reform in methods of re- 
ligious instruction was fully discussed. (XII, pp. 256-7; xxxy, p. 419; _ 
XXXVI, pt. 2, p. 49.) ' 
VI.—CouRsE oF STUDY. 
The general rules for instruction are that the exercises in the school 
shall be chiefly with a view to the development of the faculties; that the 
subjects to be taught must be introduced in suitable order; that the chil- 
» dren, alternately with the reading exercises, shall early practice writing 
and counting; that the instruction in Bible history shall precede the 
catechetical instruction, and that the instruction in other subjects shall 
not be put off beyond the time when it can be profitably made use of by 
the scholars.. In the higher people’s schools the same subjects are taught 
as in the common or lower elementary grades, but with more extended 
courses of instruction. In the secondary schools a general education 
above the range of the people’s schools is imparted, as well as an elemen- 
tary knowledge of the sciences. The study of the latter is pursued still 
further, either at a university or at some higher scientificschool. In the 
normal schools the instruction is partly theoretical and partly practical, 
the first two years being theoretical. Practical instruction is carried on    
      
 
-P-A-G-E-280

in the second year by the pupils attending the ins 
_in the practical department and by their assisting him (xxv1, pp. 149, 
150; X11, pp. 73, 74). The course of study in the primary schools com- 
prehends religion, beginning with recital from Bible history and the 
doctrine of faith from Luther’s catechism, Swedish language by the 
writing and reading method, writing, arithmetic, beginning with mental 
arithmetic—the first four rules being especially practiced—and geome- 
try, geography, and history, with a connected review of Swedish history, 
and outlines of history in other countries, natural history, drawing, 
singing, gymnastics, and in combination with them military exercises 
such as marches, movements, etc., horticulture ae arboriculture, and 
manual training. In the smaskolor the course is limited to religion, 
exercises in reading and writing (xviu, pp. 21-25; v, pp. 63-142; xxv, 
pp. 14-16; xxv1, pp. 150-157), arithmetic, drawing, singing, and gym- 
nastics. Religious teaching is compulsory in the schools, but since a 
discussion of this question at a gathering of teachers in August, 1588, 
it has been decided to give less time to this subject. In the schools of 
Stockholm a reduction of two-thirds—from thirty-eight to twenty-five 
-hours—constitutes the present stage of reform. Instruction is to be 
less dogmatic in character, and more attention is to be paid to biblical 
history. (XII, pp. 256-7; xxxv, p.419.) The course of study in the 
schools of Stockholm has book-keeping as an additional branch, and 
swimming for boys and girls,in the summer-time. Natation is said to

than four kilometres from the sea. (Xvitl, p. 24). Skilled handiwork— 
“ husslojd ”— for girls is taught in the elementary schools, from the first 
principles upward. Inan elementary school at Nits, established for this 
purpose, all feminine occupations, such as spinning, weaving, hand and “EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-8.

pupils devote 6 hours a week, with 40 weeks in the year, to these 
branches. (XVIUL, p. 25.) The work is regarded more asan educating 
process than as tending specially towards a trade. At Goteborg, for 
example, at the age of 10 or 11 years the children go into the workshop 
attached to the elementary school. The first year they are exercised in

  wood work (carpentering, turning, and carving), on iron-work (at the = 
forge), in paper and card board (book-binding), in color (house-paint- 
ing), and in wicker-work (basket-making). The second year the pupil 
specifies whattrade he wishes to pursue, and the apprenticeship lasts un- 
tilabout the fourteenth year. (xxxv1, part1, pp. 11-16.) Thereis no pro- 
gramme, in any strict sense, after the first year, A master workman gives — : 
the instruction to a dozen or more pupils grouped together, the exercises 
giving opportunity for the handling of all tools peculiar to this class of 
work, (XXXVI, part 2, p.53.) Every year those who have distinguished 
themselves by their industry or their progress receive a suitable reward 
in tools suited to their trade. At the close of the three years the pupils 
are so trained that they immediately receive pay from their employers. 
- The object of this instruction in elementary grades is to exercise - 
manual skill, to fix the attention and awaken intelligence, to give habits 
of order, to limit the construction to useful objects, to develop strength, 
and to present a progressive series, graduated according to difficulties 
of execution. (XXXVI, part 2, p. 50.) The normal school, “Sléjdlarare- 
seminarium,” at Nids, which fits teachers for Slojd instruction, was 
established in 1875, and for five years its courses prepared teachers for 
schools of a technical character. The final examinations included theo- 
retical studies, a practical test in linear drawing and shop work, and a 
didactic examination in the school of practice, (XXXVI, part 1, pp. 
20-25.) Since 1830 the course is modified, the theoretical course sup- 
pressed, and the instruction concentrated on manual work, with 
instruction in drawing, writing, ciphering, etc. Since then, the school — 
is not limited to teachers merely, but it is open to all persons who have 
< received diplomas from the school and who desire to introduce indus- 
. trial education in the schools where they are employed. (XXXVI, part 
1, pp. 20-25.) Lectures on pedagogy are given, and discussions take 
place in regard to the historical development of education and in regard — 
to methods of manual training for primary grades. (XXXVII, p. 256.) 
The temporary normal course lasts 6 weeks and a review takes place 
the following year, covering 5 weeks. In general these two courses suf- — 
fice for the preparation of teachers in the construction of the hundred 
s models of the series, if they continue the tool practice during the year 
' which intervenes between the two. (XXXVI, part 1, pp. 20-25.) 
The basis of the instruction at normal schools is noticed under train- 
ing of teachers, but, as a type of study in the higher seminaries, the _

A preponderance of classical studies is especially noticeable in these

which will be referred to farther on. (

_ Special attention is paid to gymnastic exercises, which, according to 
Swedish methods, omit ropes, rings, parallel bars, ete., and simply pre- 
sent free and easy movement tending to produce suppleness and agility, 
and to exercise all organs of the body. In connection with these are 
the military exercises which tend especially to muscular development. 
They are given to all the seven classes for half an hour each day ; the 
fifth class has one hour, and the sixth and seventh classes two hours 
each week in the use of arms, At the beginning a d end of each school 
  year amore extended course of training is given in drill, target shoot- 
ing, and field manceuvres for eight or ten weeks, to the pupils of the 
sixth and seventh classes. The ‘Gymnastika Central Institut,” or cen- 
tral institute for gymnastics, founded by Henrik Ling, the inventor of 
Swedish gymnastics, is an especially noteworthy institution. Its course 
isin three departments. One to train officers to superintend gymnastics 
in the army and navy, a second to train teachers of gymnastics for the 
town and country schools, and a third for the study of gymnastics as a 
system of medical treatment. The Swedish system, as taught at this

school, has been adopted in Germany, England, and other countries. 
(XVI, pp. 16, 24; XxxvIII, p. 383.) 
The tAchnical clomantARe schools give both a theoretical and practical 
education, comprising mathematics, linear and freehand drawing, mod- 
elling, mechanics, mechanical technology, engineering, natural philoso- 
phy, chemistry, botany, zoJlogy, modern languages, bookkeeping, and 
commerce. Mechanical trades are taught in free evening and Sunday 
classes. (XXVI, pp. 184,185; xxxvutt, pp. 383-387; xviir, p. 51.) The’ 
“Kongl. Tekniska Hogskola” in Stockholm, a higher type of technical 
school, adds geology and topography, road and canal construction, min- 
ing, and smelting. (VIII, pp. 8-17.) The “Chalmerska Sléjdskola,” in 
Géteborg, omits the mining branches. In some of these technical schools 
‘there are divisions for art industries to which women are admitted, a 
regular theoretical course, and instruction in wood-carving, modelling, © 
engraving, etc., being included. (xxxvin, p. 881; xvuI, p. 50.) 
The agricultural schools have a course of study leading up to the 
agricultural colleges, where the instruction comprises agricultural and 
rural economy with study of land laws, farm architecture, diseases of 
domestic animals, cattle raising, etc., in addition to such branches as 
chemistry, natural philosophy, and practical mechanics; courses of 
lectures, finely illustrated, are also given by distinguished professors. 
Among the many elementary and secondary schools there are private 
institutions, the course of study being such as to entitle the graduates 
to admission to the universities. There are also a large number of 
private professional and trade schools with courses of study similar to 
the public secondary and sléjd schools. (xXXvItI, pp. 381-387.) i 
For students who have successfully passed the examination at the 
“elementar-skolor” (secondary schools) there are the universities at 
Upsala and Lund which have complete theological, legal, medical, and 
philosophical faculties. Each faculty confers three degrees of scholar- 
ship, viz., the degree of candidate, of licentiate, and of doctor, and it is 
stated that no man in Sweden can be a clergyman, a lawyer, or doctor — 
unless he has graduated at either Upsala or Lund. The student is free. 
to follow any course that he desires, and all instruction is gratuitous. 
The academic year is divided into two terms, the one from September 1 to 
December 15, and the other from January 15 to the first of June, (XLI, 
P. 87.) Among the teachers are found training masters in music, draw- 
ing, gymnastics, and fencing, and in horsemanship at Upsala. 
Women are admitted as students in the universities after passing the 
regular examination; they are allowed to follow the studies of their 
choice, and some are on the rolls as students of philosophy and medi- 
cine. (XXVI, p. 195.) 
Comprehensive courses of study for the professions are found in the 
medico-surgical institute, in the institute of pharmacy, in military and 
naval schools, and in other higher grade schools. (XXXvIII, pp. 381-— 
390; XXVI, pp. 193-195; Xx1I, p. 737; XVI, p. 2839.) i

with fireplaces, and arranged with strict regard to the health of pupils, ’ 
‘and with necessary conveniences for instruction. As a result of this a 
law the school buildings are large and well arranged with wide stair- 
ways and well ventilated and well lighted class rooms, the light usually 
coming from the left side. New school buildings have furnaces in the 
cellar, ventilators,* separate’ buildings for gymnastic exercises, cloak 
rooms for each class, suitable toilet arrangements, two work rooms 
‘where the teachers correct class work, prepare their lessons, rest when 
they are at liberty, and have lunch. Independent of these is the prin- 
cipal’s room, where parents, teachers, and pupils are welcome morning 
' orevening. The court-yards or play grounds for each sex are spa- 
cious, and sometimes there is an additional garden for women teachers. 
In Stockholm the school buildings are of a high type of architecture 
with vast covered galleries upon which open the class rooms. The 
“walls of these class rooms are wainscoted and adorned with engray- 
ings and plaster casts. The seating capacity of each class room is for 
thirty-six pupils, each pupil having a chair and table. (xviit, p. 11.) 
Hours of school.—The hours of school are usually from. five to six 
a day, with intermissions of a few minutes between hours, but in 
some schools instruction is given in the forenoon only. (XXVI, p. : 
148; xxv, pp. 11-12.) \ ‘ 
Length of recesses.—The length of recesses varies; it may be a few 
minutes, fifteen minutes, or half an hour. (xvill, p. 18; XXv,pp.11-12; 
XXVI, p. 148.) 
Holidays and vacations—The vacations are of three consecutive 
months in Sweden, and the instruction generally covers eight school 
months divided into two terms, but sometimes into three or four terms. 
In a few schools instruction is given during nine or ten months. (XXVI, 
1 p. 148; xvi, p. 18.) 
Compulsory attendance.—Attendance upon school is compulsory for 
children who have attained their ninth year, and all who do not receive 
' instruction at home or in private schools must attend publie schools. 
The instruction generally begins with the seventh and lasts till the fonr- 
teenth year. Children whose parents are not able to keep them in 
school during that period are aided by the authorities. (XXVI, p. 146; 
XXV, p. 9.) 
School supply.—The schools are well supplied with apparatus, and 
every school has a library to which additions of books are made each 
term. There are also school museums with zodlogical, geological, and bo- 
        
*The statements made in 1383 by the commission appointed to investigate the 
hygienic coudition of school buildings, sickness of children, near-sightedness, ete., 
indicate that at that date the school rooms were not well aired or properly ventilated. 
The ventilators were arranged so near the floor, the pupils could not sit near them ; 
the ventilation pipes were often filled with mortar, and the air became very impure; 
the carbonic acid in the air increased from 0.67 before school to 2.34 parts in a thous- 
and after one hour, eyen with windows and ventilators open before the commence-

Schools for special classes.—Among the schools for special classes is 
the school for the deaf and dumb at Manilla, which was also open to the 
blind until recently, but now the blind to the number of 400 are taught 
in special institutions supported by the state. The instruction for 
this class is both theoretical and practical, comprising preparatory and 
primary courses, and special attention is paid to Sléjd training. 
Instrumental music and singing and trades suited to their condition 
are also taught. There are eighteen schools for deaf mutes, four of 
    | @HE ‘SCHOOL SYSTEM OF SWEDEN. fae ey aR 
them state institutions, six established by communities, and the others — 
free schools with scholarships established by the government. A normal 
department for teachers of this class is attached to the Manilla school. 
The course of study is two years in duration, and pupils are taught by 
the articulation method. (xvuI, pp. 29, 33, 37, 40.) 
The Society for the Education of Idiots has established seventeen 
schools for this class since 1866, all supported by the state, and with women 
in charge. The course of study coyers object lessons, religious instruc- 
tion, reading, writing, dictation, singing, gymnastics, domestic economy, — ; 
and skilled handiwork ; for girls, spinning, weaving, lace-making, rug- 
making, and knitting ; for boys, work in the garden, cabinet-making, 
wood-carving, and other suitable occupations. (XVIII, pp. 37, 40.) 
Classed among the institutions for special classes are orphan asylums, 
those under the auspices of the Masonic fraternity and of the society 
“Pro Patria” being especially mentioned. An orphan asylum in Stock- 
holm places its children in the country to be brought up among the 
agricultural classes. Special institutions for abandoned children are 
not reported in Sweden. (XXVI, p. 232, 161.) 
X.—HISTORICAL STATEMENT. 
The people’s schools in Sweden, as in Germany, may be said to be a 
creation of the Reformation, although prior to that there were cloister 
schools taught, by the Catholic priests, while mendicant friars wandered 
about from place to place teaching the church commandments, but 
omitting all instruction in reading and writing. During the sixteenth 
century Catholicism was crowded out, and Protestantism took its place 
as the religion of the country. The Protestant Kings, Gustavus Vasa, 
Charles IX, and Gustavus Adolphus, vied with each other in trying to 
educate the people, and it is stated that in 1637 there were few children 
‘of the peasant class who were unable to read and write. In 1640 Queen 
Christina, aided by her counsellors, established a school or pedagogie 
in every city belonging to the Swedish Crown. ‘The lowest class was an

on June 18,1842, which entirely reorganized the school system. As an- 
outcome of that law, the number of stationary schools increased from 
165 in 1800 to 786 in 1842, and to 6,448 in 1883, This law was super- 
seded by one of January 20, 1882, which retained, however, many 
- features of the original law. The laws being similar, the main points of 
that of 1882 are interpolated here. According to that law, every dis- 
‘trict in the city and every parish in the country was to have at least — 
one stationary school with a trained teacher. Still, in case of a sparse 
population, several districts were allowed to unite in the establishment 
of'such schools. Each school district was to have a school board, and 
to pay for its own school buildings. All children of school age were to 
be enrolled in the schools, and in the principal town of the Retna 
normal schools were to be established. 
As will be observed, a special feature of the school system is the in- 
fluence of the church over the school. While every district has its 
school board, the board is under the control of the church authorities, 
and merely acts as executive for the consistory. The school inspectors 
have a sort of counteracting influence, however, and act in a measure 
for the government. Yet, while the teacher is subordinate to thechureh 
authorities, the church’s Controlling action is such that steady progress 
in educational affairs is observed. : 
In 1858, by the addition of certain branches the “smdaskolor” were 
made preparatory divisions of elementary grades, and higher people’s 
schools were established at which the teachers were expected to havea 
higher class of attainment, and the school was to be superior in char- 
acter to any established before. The government granted subsidies to 
the different districts to aid in the establishment of these schools, 
In 1871 the schools, Stockholm excepted, had increased to 7,118, among 
them 10 higher people’s schools, 2,268 stationary schools, 1,164 ambu- 
latory schools, and 2,676 smaskolor. The number of teachers’ semi- 
naries required by law of 1842 had diminished greatly during this 
period, as a centralization of such instruction had been determined 
upon. Theabove schools had increased in 1883 to 9,794, among them 
13 higher people’s schools, 6,448 stationary schools, and 3,346 ambula- 
tory schools. The number of pupils of school age was 716,025, and au 
average of about 73 pupils of school age to each school is observed. 
According to school regulations every pupil must attend school, or be 
properly taught at home, and children who are taught at home must 
come to the school for yearly examination. Instruction is gratuitous, © 
bat the parish has the liberty, if additional funds are needed, of de- 
manding a small sum for each child who is not too poor to pay, though 
this demand is seldom made. Private schools are also under the stiper- 
vision of the regular board, so that there is perfect correspondence be- 
tween public and private instruction. (xx, pp. 707-710; xxiII, pp. 
53-54.) 
Secondary schools also date from a very early period, the instruction

being’ first given in cloister schools and by monks. The secondary 
schools were a creation of the Reformation, as were the lower schools. 
An ecclesiastical decree of 1571 is looked upon as the first Swedish school 
law, unless papal letters of an earlier period may be so called. Accord- 
‘ing to this law, each school had a schoolmaster, nd if there were too 
many pupils one of the “hearers” aidedhim. Religion, Latin, Swedish 
language, and hymns were taught, but whoever desired to learn Greek 
and Hebrew had to look out for such instruction himself. Gustavus 
Adolphus first established gymnasia, and in 1649 Queen Christina, his 
daughter, promulgated a decree which divided the schools into peoples 
schools and higher schools. The former had as course of study read- 
ing, writing, and the elements of arithmetic, religion, and Latin; the 
latter were divided into the ethnological, the syntactic, the rhetorical, 
and the logical classes. The lower classes had class teachers ; the upper 
class, in which Latin was the language spoken, was taught by a rector 
and assistant rector. The branches were Greek, rhetoric, logic, and 
' arithmetic; history and geography were not taught. The first germ of. 
the burgher school, the precursor of the Real school, was found at that 
date in the “writing classes,” in which were taught catechism, read- 
ing, writing, the mother tongue, and arithmetic through the quartanos. 
This was the basis of the “trivial” + school, eo is still in existence 
to-day after two hundred years. The gymnasia of that period had four 
classes with instruction in doctrinal theology, Hebrew, natural sciences, 
mathematics, and the basis of the Swedish laws. History and geography 
were taught later, but only verbally. A decree of King Charles XI, 
in 1693, added a fifth class to the gymnasia. Church history and moral 
philosophy were added to the course, and while it was especially speci- 
fied that the trivial school was to fit for practi al life, the gymnasia 
was gradually verging towards achurch seminary. The consistory had 
full control of these schools, and by law of 1724 no one except a resi- 
dent of the church district could be appointed to a teacher’s position. 
From that date to 1807 a more practical turn was given to the trivial 
Schools; physical training was attempted, physics, anthropology, his- 
_ tory, geography, and bookkeeping were added to the course. The 
school law of 1807 added Swedish statistics and modern languages 
to the course in the gymnasia, changed the pedagogier of that period 
into burgher schools, and planned to have a general course of study 
for the lower classes of gymnasia, burgher, and trivial schools. (XXII, 
pp. 718-721, vil, pp. 1-17.) This plan was op osed by the church 
consistory, and a commission was appointed in 1820 through whose 
efforts new regulations were made which brought ut the distinct sub- 
division, of classical and non-classical schools—or those which dealt 
with the old-classic humanities as apart from those which dealt with 
        
  
1In the Middle Ages the trivium, from which the word tri ial school is derived, in- cluded the studies of grammar, rhetoric, and logic; to-day the term is understood to include the ordinary branches required in practical life.

‘THE SCHOOL SYSTEM OF SWEDEN. 
  the encyclopedic realities ; but this law failed to meet the requirements 
of the Real and burgher schools, and again in 1828 another commission 
was appointed to investigate the whole subject of education. New 
methods were adopted which sanctioned greater freedom of instruction, 
introduced optional branches, allowed each student to go to a higher 
class whenever he showed fitness for such change, grouped all students 
together in one large room where the teacher could go about from pupil 
to pupil and suggest as to methods of study, brought about a state of _ 
monitorial instruction, the farther advanced helping those less so, and 
permitted the passing of graduation examinations for the universities 
. with the classics omitted. The so-called new elementary schools, “Nya 
elementarskolor,’ of Stockholm were established on this principle.: 
Even this plan failed to satisfy the learned men of Sweden, and from 
1828 to 1845 discussions took place in regard to a revision of methods by 
which a reuniting of the higher classical schools and gymnasia was 
accomplished. (XXM, pp. 721-723). On July 16, 1849, a royal decree 
united the writing classes (burgher schools) and trivial (or Real) schools 
into an institution in which instruction was given in all branches 
taught in both; made the gymnasia preparatory schools for the univer- 
sity, and created the “ elementar liroverken” which were the means 
of greatly increasing attendance in the higher grades of schools and in 
the universities; but this decree brought in a class of pupils unfitted 
for the higher courses and unable to keep up with them, (xxrv 
p. 347.) The opposition of the consistory, the lack of system, and the 
superficial knowledge of too many studies were very perceptible at this 
period of affairs, and in 1856 when the encyclopedic methods of study . 
were at their height other attempts were made to still improve upon 
former educational plans, but the new decrees only served to add 
to the confusion, while those of 1859 simply adhered to the so-called 
new methods, strengthened the study of the classies, and limited the 
special studies. From that date gradual changes were made until a 
new law of November 1, 1878, was promulgated. This law still holds 
good. But again in 1882 a new commission was appointed to remodel 
the secondary grade of instruction. The results of the investigations 
of this commission were presented in 1884, but their antipathy to the 
classics was so apparent as to awaken opposition among the school 
officials, and it is doubted whether the proposed reorganization will be 
carried out. One point specified by the commission was the removal 
of the secondary schools from the control of the ephor (bishop), and the 
appointment of a special higher school officer or council, to have direct 
charge of these schools, This officer was to deal directly with head- 
quarters, and to relieve the ephor and school inspectors under his charge 
in regard toall points appertaining to school organization, hours of study, 
_ programmes, reports to higher school officers, etc. But'so much oppo- 
sition to this plan was engendered, that latest advices would indicate 
its non-acceptance by thepeople. (vr, pp. 23, 137, 144-160; xxtz, pp.

"the boys who worked a shorter time than the average 50.8 per cent 
were ill, while among those who worked more than the average 56.1 
per cent. were classed assick. A comparison between the higher grade 
schools and elementary grades was not made, as the commission did not 
take these lower schools into consideration. This was done in Den- 
mark, however, in 188t, when the hygienic conditions there were in- 
vestigated, and the results presented by the Danish commission were 
such as to indicate a similar percentage of sickness in both elementary 
and secondary grades. (XXVII, pp. 1-16.) ‘ 
Thereorganization brought about by the investigations of the Swedish 
commission is to include the appointment of a school physician. He is 
to visit each school once a month to consider hygienic conditions, to 
measure and weigh the pupils at the beginning and end of the year so as 
to report upon their growth, to examine as to nearsightedness, ete. He 
is also’ to be consulted about school programmes and hours of study, so 
that there will be less liability to over-pressure and consequent illness. 
The teacher is expected to act as his assistant, so far as daily watchful- 
ness is concerned, and to consult with him in regard to possible changes 
of method. Since the publications of these investigations other educa- 
tional reforms have been attempted from year to year, all tending 
towards improvement in methods and with the special object of shorten- 
ing the number of hours of study. The present plan of reconstruction 
seems to be to throw Greek, Latin, Hebrew, and Sanscrit out of the 
intermediate schools and gymnasia, and place them ina special depart- 
ment of the university. (XXXIV,p.10.) This is probably the result of 
a suggestion to the Government made by the Swedish university com- 
mittee that the youngest students should receive instruction similar to 
that given at the school; that the professor is personally to advise be- 
ginners how to plan and commence their university studies; that heis — 
to ascertain by oral and written examinations whether the students fol- 
low his advice, and finally that none but those who pass an examination 
are to be admitted to the higher classes, where scientific lectures by the | 
professors are the students’ sole guide. Ss (XXV, p. 32.) 
  
* The latest progressive movement is that of the students of the University of Upsala, 
who, in 1891. are to present a request to the King that instruction in military admin- 
istration and organization be given at that university. The course to cover military 
history and strategy of defense in case Sweden is attacked. Fifteen to twenty les- 
sons a year to be given. (XL, p. 628.)

Finland has been annexed to Russia, but not incorporated in it. 
Since it was ceded to Russia on September 17, 1809, it has preserved, 
by special grant of Alexander I in 1810 (renewed by his successors), 
some remains of its ancient constitution, which, ai from 1772, was 
reformed in 1789, and slightly modified in 1869 and 1882. There is a 
national Diet copsiees g of nobles, clergy, burghers, and peasants, who 
discuss laws proposed by the Emperor. Schemes of laws are elabor- 
ated by a committee for the affairs of Finland i in St. Petersburg. Four 
of the members of this committee are nominated by the Crown (two of 
them being proposed by the senate). The senate, which sits at Hel- 
singfors, is nominated by the Crown. It is under the presideney of the 
governor-general, wlio represents the Czar. The senate is the supreme 
administrative power in Finland, and consists of two departments, 
justice and finance, which have the administration of various divisions 
of the internal affairs of Finland. The educational system of Finland 
is separated from thatof Russia. (XI, pp. 843, 844 ; XII, p. 2659.) 
I.—GENERAL FEATURES OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM.   
The school system includes four classes of schools, grouped as ele- 
mentary, higher, professional, and. for the education of the deaf, dumb, 
and blind. All except the professional schools are in charge of a cen- 
tral board of education at Helsingfors. (VI p. 47.)

  ‘THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF FINLAND. — 
Establishment.—The establishment of public schools was brought 
about by a decree of April 19, 1858, which required rural districts to 
establish stationary schools, and promised them governmental support. 
The diet of 1863~64 having voted necessary funds for promoting popu- 
lar education, a decree of May 11, 1866, definitely organized elementary. 
instruction in Finland. According to this decree each town was topro- 
vide a sufficient number of elementary schools for all children between 
seven and fourteen years of age, who were not being educated at home, 
or in schools of a higher grade. Schools must be established also for 
pupils of a more advanced age who were without earlier advantages. 
According to this decree elementary schools were to be divided into 
lower and higher grades, the former for children between six and ten 
years of age, the latter for those between ten and fourteen years. In 
rural communes the earliest instruction of children is given in families, 
but by this same decree the authorities are required to see that if such’ 
instruction is not given the children attend either a stationary or ambu- 
latory school. (VI, pp. 47,48; VII, pp. 459-461.) 
Control.—The control of the school system is vested in a higher school 
poard—“ Ofverstyrelsen for Skolvisendet”—at Helsingfors.. This board 
is an adjunct ot the Imperial Senate of Finland, and especially con- 
nected with the administrative section of public instruction and wor- 
ship. An inspector in chief, appointed by the Czar, as suggested by 
this higher council, acts as inspector of elementary and normal schools. 
There are also local inspectors, provided for by law of 1869, in each gov- 
ernmental subdivision of Finland, and in each district, or commune, a 
local board of education composed of from four to six members. (X, 
p. 218; VII, pp. 464, 465.) 
Maintenance.—The schools are maintained by both state and local 
funds. The state gives an annual subsidy for the payment of teachers, 
providing the district constructs suitable school buildings and furnishes 
the teacher with lodging and ground around it. Private schools also~ 
receive state subsidies. The school budget contains subsidies for second- 
ary, higher, professional, and special schools. (VI, p. 48; I, p. 161.)

II.—STATISTICS. 
Population, 2,270,912 (in 1887); enrollment in elementary schools, 
62,893; ratio of enrollment to total population, 2 percent. (XI, p. 848). 
Elementary schools, pupils, and teachers.—There were 971 elementary 
schools (fasta folkskolor) reported in 1887-’88 in Finland; teachers 
(lararepersonal), 1,264; pupils in elementary and infant schools (barn- 
skolor), 62,893; boys, 34,113; girls, 28,780. , (I, pp. 106, 107).

teachers, 432; pupils 4,461. The 4 preparatory schools (férskolor) for 
pupils desiring to enter the lyceums had 13 teachers and 159 pupils. 
Classed under secondary schools are 52 institutions for girls, with 559. 
teavhers and 4,057 pupils. There are also 5 industrial schools (indns- 
triskolor), with 37 teachers and 255 pupils. (I, pp. 100-117; VI, p.51.) 
Higher education.—The 4 normal schools (folkskollirare och lararinne- 
seminarier) had 45 teachers and 563 pupils. The “Universitet i Hel. 
singfors” had 90 professors and 1,703 students, 14 of them women. 
Classed under secondary and higher education are the following special 
schools: The “ Polytekniska Institutet,” with 31 professors and 132 stn- 
dents in 1888-89; 7 navigation schools (navigationsskolor), with 113 
pupils; 6 commercial schools (handelsskolor), with 57 teachers and 297 
‘pupils; 31 Sunday schools for apprentices in 1886, with 111 teachers — 
- and 2,111 pupils; 12 agricultural schools (landtbruksliroverken), with 
44 teachers and 279 pupils; and 16 dairy schools (mejerili:overken), 
with 41 teachers and 148 pupils in 188788; trade schools (handtverk- 
_ skolor), 12; pupils, 965; teachers, 68 in 1888~89. Then there are the 
5 deaf and dumb schools (défstumsskolor), with 22 teachers and 225 
pupils; the 2 institutions for the blind (blindanstalter), with 11 teach- 
ers and 54 pupils; and the asylums for idiots (idiotanstalter), with 2 
teachers and 9 pupils, which also report for the year 188889. (I, pp. 
95-118.; VI, p. 53.) 
Length of school year.—This is not specified for the elementary schools, 
but it is stated that instruction must be given at least 30 weeks and 30° 
hours a week during the year, in order that the higher elementary 
schools may receive governmental aid. Secondary schools are kept 
open from September 1 to December 20, and from January 14 to May 
31; the university from September 15 to December 15, and from Jan- 
uary 15 to May 15. (X, p. 215; VII, pp. 466, 497.) 
Ages of pupils.—According to decree of May 11, 1866, districts are 
required to establish schools enough for all children between 7 and 14 
years of age who are not receiving instruction either at home or ina 
higher grade school. Still older pupils are required to have school facil- 
ities allowed them if their early education has been neglected. 
In the lower grade elementary schools the age is 6 to 10 years; in 
the higher elementary grades from 10 to 14years. (VI, p. 48; VII, p.

Income.—Lhe income for school purposes is derived from governmental 
subsidies and from communal funds. The government gives an annual 
subsidy of $154 for the payment of each male teacher, and of $116 for the 
payment of each woman teacher in the commune, providing the district 
establishes stationary schools and furnishes the teachers with lodging, 
ground, etc. ity districts receive 25 per cent, of their expenses,

The amount voted by the Diet in 1887 for elementary education was 
£246,395, namely: For‘elementary schools in cities and rural districts, 
$155,801; for teachers’ seminaries fitting teachers for primary schools, 
575,960; for inspection of elementary schools, $11,260; incidentals, 
manual training, ete., $3,374. (VII, p. 464.) 
The amount raised in the communes or districts is not known to date. 
The amount received from tuition fees is not known. Tuition fees! are, 
however, requisite in secondary schools, the fees varying in amount 
avcording to the subjects of instruction. (X, p. 216.) 
Eupenditure.—The expenditures for the year 1889 included the follow- 
lowing amounts: For the university and polytechnic school, $168,453; 
supervision of schools and for higher educational institutions, $466,264; 
normal and public elementary schools, $254,670; professional schools, 
£54,413; institutions for blind and deaf mutes, $17,518; incidentals, 
$5,539; rental of buildings, $13,802; reserve funds for elementary 
schools, $77,200; agricultural and dairy schools, $57,707. (I, pp. 
161, 162.)     
IV.—SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION. 
State supervision.—The “ Ofverstyrelsen for Skolviisendet,” or higher — 
council of education, at Helsingfors, has supervision of elementary, 
secondary, and special schools. This board or council is an adjunct of 
the imperial senate of Finland (administrative department), and of the 
section of public instruction and ecclesiastical affairs. It regulates the 
ogrammes for schools from the pedagogical and technical side, and 
attends to apportionment of school material, ete.. Private schools sub- 
sidized by the state are under the supervision of this central organiza. — 
tion. There is also an inspector in chief for elementary education and 
normal schools, who is appointed by the Czar at the suggestion of the 
board or council. His duties as presiding officer of the central board 
are to decide upon all questions appertaining to elementary instruc- 
tion. The University as reorganized by law of 1852 is under control of 
the academic authorities, consisting of the rector and 12 professors ; 
in eases of special importance 82 professors are added to this board. 
Any project modifying its organization must be referred to the senate 
and there receive imperial sanction .ere it can be carried out. (VII, 
pp. 462-464, 497, 498.) ¢ 
Local supervision.—A local inspector has charge of elementary schools 
in each governmental subdivision or provinee. A council of education 
has the immediate inspection of the communal schools. This council 
is composed of 4 to 6 members, who serve without pay. (VII, p. 464.) 
The local supervision of secondary schools is in charge of a council     
    
In 1873 it was stated that secondary schools, though public, were not free, the 
taition fees varying as above mentioned. Later legislation may have modified this 
statement. 1

V—TEACHERS. 
Preparation.—Teachers for the elementary grades receivethe requisite 
preparation at the normal school in Jyviiskyli (Jyviskyli seminarium), 
which, founded in 1863, has, with its two divisions for men and for 
women, the special object of preparing teachers for the districts where 
Finnish is spoken. The normal school for women at Ekenis (Ekenis 
lirarinne seminarium) established in 1871, and the’ normal for men 
at Nykarleby (Nykarleby lirare seminarium), established in 1873, pre- 
pare teachers for the Swedish-speaking population. There is also a 
school with two divisions, the ‘Sordavala Seminarium,” which has 
16 teachers and 122 pupils. The schools have a four years’ course, the 
last year being more particularly for practice in the elementary schools 
of higher and lower grade, each seminary having such schools attached 
_ to it. The normals for women have each a kindergarten and infant 
school, so that the pupils may early train themselves to fill positions in 
such schools. The normals receive both boarding and day pupils, the 
greater proportion being day pupils. The age at which pupils are 
received in the seminaries is eighteen years. 
' Many of the professors connected with city schools of elementary 
grade have received a university education; the women teachers in 
‘similar schools formerly attendéd Naeeesta courses at Helsingfors. 
(1, p. 105; VI, p. 48; VII, p. 461.) 
Beiminations. There are examinations at the close of the normal 
school course, the passing of which entitles the graduate to a certificate 
of qualification to teach, but further information as to examinations and 
licensing has not been obtained. (X, p. 215.) 
Appointment.—The appointment of teachers is made by the higher 
council of education. (X, p. 215.) 
Tenure of office.—The tenure of office is for life, subject to removal 
after trial by the higher authorities. (X, p. 205.) 
Salaries—The salaries of teachers in district elementary schools 
average $154 for men, and $116 for women. This salary is paid by the 
governmental abortion: and the district authorities add lodgings, con- 
taining at least two rooms and a kitchen, with ground for gardening, 
and pasturage enough for a cow. Salaries! of teachers and professors 
in higher grade schools not known to date. (VI, p. 49; VII, pp. 461, 462.) 
  
1 According to a statement made in 1873, after the first ten years’ teaching, the 
salary is increased 20 per cent. for 5 years, and 10 per cent. for each subsequent 5 
years. The salaries of regular teachers in Real schools ranged at that date from $463 
to $579 with lodging; in lyceums, from $540 to $887 with lodging; in girls’ schools 
from $579 to $772 for men, with lodging; and from $307 to $463 for women, with lodg- 
ing. The principal of each school received from $57 to $193 additional compensation,

» Teachers’ pensions.—No information to date. 
Teachers institutes--No mention is made of any such meetings, but 
the advanced educational movements noted in Finland would imply | 
that such conferences were held from time to time for the cee en of 
educational questions. 
VI.—COURSES OF STUDY. 
Kindergarten.—Instruction in the kindergarten not specified, but 
doubtless Frébel’s methods are carried out. The earliest teachings for 
children are commenced at home, or else they learn to read in ambula- 
tory schools, which move from district to district every 2 or 3 months. 
(VI, p. 50.) Hlementary schools.—The course in elementary schools is 4 years, 
divided into two parts of 2 years each. These form the higher and 
lower grade of élementary schools. The course of study is so arranged 
that the two lower classes are complete in themselves; the higher classes — 
simply continue the course and introduce new methods. The studies for 
the higher elementary grades are religion, mother tongue, geography, 
history, arithmetic, elements of plane and descriptive geometry, natural 
sciences and their applications, drawing, singing, gymnastics, manual | 
training for boys, and feminine handiwork for girls. In the lower ele- 
mentary grades the same studies, omitting history, geography, geometry, 
and natural sciences. Manual training is made a specialty in elementary _ 
grades, and occupies about 5 hours a week in each class. (VII, p. 462.) 
The course of study in the industrial schools is either a continuation 
of that found in the elementary schools, or it is adapted to prepare stu- 
dents for special schools. (VI, p. 51.) a 
Secondary schools.—The secondary schools form three groups, ¢. @., 
Jyceums with eight classes or years, with course of study leading di- 
rectly to universities or special schools; elementary schools for boys 
with two, three, four, or five classes or years, the programme correspond- 
ing to that of similar classes in the lyceum; elementary schools for girls 
with five classes. Pupils are admitted at 9 years of age in the boys’ 
schools, and 11 years of age in the girls’ schools. Studies for these 
grades are TEU Swedish, Finnish; Russian ie boys’ schools); Ger- 
    
, 1 Teachers? pensions: In 1873 it was stated that teachers of elementary schools after 
30 years’ service were entitled to a retiring pension for life, equal to the Government 
allowance for the last year’s salary of the teacher. Teachers of secondary grades 
who have taught 35 years, may retire with an annuity equal to the salary at that 
date; after 30 years with three-quarters of his salary; and after 25 years with the 
half; after 20 years’ service with one-quarter salary ; and if afflicted with incurable 
. disease at an earlier period, he is entitled also to a pension. Later information in 
regard to this point is wanting. (X, p. 216.) 
2A teachers’ association was organized in 1863 at Tavastehus, its central organiza- 
tion being in Helsingfors, however, with branches in several, cities. Meetings were 
held once a month, Regular conventions were called every 3 years for discussion of 
educational matters. (X, p. 221.)

man, French, English (in Reallyceums); the classics, pate, ahaiane, 
botany, zoblogy, physics, mathematics, drawing, singing, gymnastics ; 
and in girls’ schools feminine handiwork. (V, p. 466.) ‘ 
Two normal lyceums (Swedish and Finnish) in Helsingfors serve as 
practice schools for persons who intend to become teachers in secondary 
grades. Two Swedish and Finnish continuation schools for girls.in 
Helsingfors have each a 3 years’ course of pedagogical study. 
The seven schools for girls supported by the Grand Duchy comprise 
in their courses of study modern languages, whatever scientific branches 
are required to give a solid education, and the pupils receive instruc- 
tion in feminine handiwork. Private schools, most of them boarding- 
schools, prepare pupils for the secondary schools, or have courses simi- 
lar to the public secondary grades. Among the private schools are six 
lyceums, five Swedish, and one Finnish, where boys and girls are edu- 
‘eated together. (VII, p. 466; VI, p. 52.) i 
As a type of the course of eda in, commercial schools, that of the 
“ Brahestads Borgareoch Handelsskola” is given. Itincludes Swedish, 
‘ Finnish, German, and English languages, Russian and French optional, 
(these branches so taught as to cover grammatical construction, keep- 
ing of books, correspondence, etc.), mathematics, commercial book- 
keeping (including double entry), physics and chemistry, national 
economy, geography and history, penmanship and gymnastics, through 
all classes. (IV, pp. 23-28.) 
Higher education.—The course of study in normal: schools prepares 
teachers to be instructors in the primary grades ; 3 the studies are not 
specified. The university has the four faculties: Theology, law, medi- 
cine, science and letters, including an historical philological section, and 
aphysico-mathematical section. (I, p.95.) Connected with this institu- 
tion are anatomical and pathological institutes ; chemical and pharma- 
ceutical and physiological. laboratories; an astronomical observatory ? 
' agymnasium; kindergarten; library, museumof history, ethnography, 
sculpture, etc. (VII, p. 497.) 
-Classed under special schools, some of which are of secondary and 
others of higher grade, is the polytechnic school “Polytekniska Insti- 
tutel,” which in a 4 years’ course prepares its students to be either 
architects and builders or mechanical engineers, land surveyors, or, as 
«“Kemisk Teknolog,” (that is, to have knowledge of chemistry as applied 
to building materials used in construction). During the firstyear’s course 
the studies are in common. The course in land surveying, however, is’ 
only of 2 years’ duration. (III, pp. 1-27, VII, p. 498.) 
Another technical school, the Agticultural Institute, which bears 
_ the same relation to the fifteen agricultural schools that the university _ 
pears to the secondary schools, has a number of specialists connected 
with it who are experienced in all branches of agriculture. The aim of 
this institute is to diffuse general knowledge of agriculture and other — 
cognate matters, to aid and advise in regard to agricultural machines,
-P-A-G-E-301
    i 
to the cultivation of foreign plants, to form plans and estimates for 
reclaiming waste lands, etc. The course of study may be inferred 
from the following classification of the members of the teaching force, 
namely: One agricultural engineer, one governmental agronomist, 
eight provincial agronomists, ten assistant agronomists, one expert 
to give instruction in flax-growing and flax-scutching, two teach- 
ers of dairy farming designated by the Government, and two by pro- 
vincial authorities, eleven women teachers from the provinces to 
teach dairying, two masters of forestry, one lecturer on arboriculture, 
six teachers of horticulture, two controllers of grain and seed, three 
instructors in the art of plowing, and one inspector of fisheries. 
Courses of popular lectures on agricultural subjects are also carried 
on in remote divisions of the Grand Duchy, The Institute of Forestry, 
by its course of study, also aids in instructing the people to make the 
most of nature’s gifts. It forms an advanced course for the school of 
forestry. (IX, pp. 50-65.) 
VIL—ScHooL MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF DISCIPLINE. 
The methods employed in teaching children in both city and rural 
schools follow the latest developments in pedagogical science. 
Corporal punishment is not employed ; the teacher relies on the honor 
of his pupils. (IX, pp. 50-65.) 
The pupils in elementary and secondary schools are examined annu- 
ally for promotion. (X, p. 216.) 
Little is known in regard to methods of study and recitations, but it 
is stated that most of the subjects are taught from the text-books and 
orally, and that in the plan of studies five hours a week are devoted to 
instruction in manual training in each class of the elementary grades. 
.The methods of study and formation of programmes are determined, 
however, by a commission appointed by the higher council of educa- 
tion, this commission having authority to investigate as to the very 
latest improvements in pedagogical methods. Formerly boys and girls 
were taught separately. Of late years coeducation has been attempted 
in many schools, the first schools of this kind being established in Hel- 
singfors in 1883, and women are admitted to the university as students. 
(VIL, p, 462; X, pp. 215-216; V, pp. 70-80.) 
VIII.—ScHOOL ORGANIZATION. 
Buildings and grounds.—Information is wanting in regard to the gen- 
eral condition of school buildings and the grounds, if any, around them. 
But it is stated that in Helsingfors the school buildings are constructed 
with vast corridors, spacious and well-ventilated class-rooms, lighted 
by electricity, and large halls for gymnastic exercises. The buildings 
are supplied with all necessary school material, and have extensive 
playgrounds connected with them. (IX, pp. 50-65.) THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM OF FINLAND. = = 229

   EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-80, 
Hours of school.—The number of school hours a day is’ not speci- 
fied, but, as has already been stated, al least thirty hours’ instruction a 
week must be given in the higher elementary grades in order to obtain 
funds for school purposes from the state. (X, p. 215.) 
Holidays.and vacations.—Date of holidays and vacations in elementary 
grades not known; in secondary grades, the Christmas holidays—De- 
cember 20 to January 14—and the vacation months of June, July, and 
August are specified. (VII, p. 466.) i 
Compulsory attendance.—Attendance is compulsory for children be- 
‘tween seven and fourteen years of age, earlier instruction being given 
either in the family, or in the ambulatory schools established in farm- 
houses in rural districts. Teachers of these schools, which move from 
point to point every two or three months, are paid by the commune, or 
receive small fees from the children taught. (VI, p. 48; VII, p. 461; 
X, p. 214.) . , f 
School supply.—The regularly established city schouls are reported as 
well supplied with apparatus and school material. (IX, pp. 50-65.) 
‘ 
IX.—SUPPLEMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 
Libraries and museums.—Aids to intellectual growth are libraries 
‘and museums, either of a public character or connected with institu- 
tions in cities and in a number of rural districts. There are also read- 
ing rooms for special study connected with people’s libraries in different 
parts of Finland. The largest library and the most important collec- 
tions are affiliated with the University of Helsingfors. These include 
"a library of 200,000 volumes, a small library of Russian literature, and 
a choice library of classical philology, an anatomical and zodlogical 
museum, a cabinet of numismatics, an ethnographical and historical 
museum, a collection of mineralogical specimens, an art museum, and 
a collection of armor and weapons of different periods. 
The archives of Finland aid in the study of the country’s history, as 
_ they contain a collection of acts dating back to 1265, and a fairly com- 
plete collection of Finland’s administrative reports since 1531. (VI, 
pp. 56, 57, VII, p. 498-501.) 
* Associations and societies—Numerous societies and associations are 
reported in Finland, several-of which haye initiated movements to pro- 
mote progress in scientific, literary, and educational matters. The ma- 
jority of these societies are under the direct influence of the university 
(VI, p. 53).. The Finnish scientific society (Finska Vetenskaps Socie- 
tet), founded in 1838, has three sections—physics and mathematics, 
natural sciences, history and philology. Its ‘“‘ Acta Societatis Scientia- 
tum Fennice,” contain papers on divers subjects and biographical 
notes. The central meteorological observatory is under the direction 
of this society. ; 
The “societas Pro Fauna et Flora Fennica,” founded 1821, has a com-

plete collection of the country’s fauna and flora, as found by prominent 
naturalists in annual excursions for such purpose. From 1848 to 1875, 
a bulletin of this work was presented to the public; since 1876 the — 
“ Acta Societatis pro Fauna et Flora Fennica” takes its place. (VII, 
pp. 501-503.) 
The Finland Archeological Society, established in 1870, has united 
its collections with the historical ethnographical collections of the uni- 
versity. 
The “Suomen-Muinaismusto: yhdistyksen aikakauskirja,” published 
since 1874, is the organ of this society. 
The historical society, founded in 1875, investigates history, archa- 
ology and cognate sciences, publishing documents relating to such sub- 
jects. Two geographical societies were established in 1888—the one 
for general study, the other for the study of the geography of Finland. 
The society for the study of Finnish literature, founded in 1831, com- 
prises three sections—philology, history, and fine arts. The “‘ Suome,” 
or annual publication of this society appears in the Finnish tongue. ~ 
Its most notable collections consist of national songs and folklore. 
In contradistinction to this society is the one for the study of Swedish 
literature in Finland, which, established in 1855, publishes annual Te 
ports of its He a (VII, pp. 501-503.) . t 
The Society for Fine Arts, founded in 1846, for the purpose of art 
study, owns at present, through gift and purehdse, a collection of seulp: , 
ture and paintings, which forms the basis of an annual exhibit oe iibetne 
of art. 
The Society of Arts, as applied to industries, established in 1875,. mdin- 
tains a professional school at Helsingfors. There are also societies or

pursuits. e489 
An imperial economic society for Finland, dating from: 1797, dims 
to promote progress in agriculture, dairy farming, etc. It publishes 
annual reports and separate papers on similar subjects: “A. society

  Schools Sor special Geiieea sBabordinated to the central administra- 
tion are two institutes for the blind, one in Helsingfors and the other 
in Kuopio; four schools for the deaf and dumb (Défstumskolor), in- 
Abo, Borga, Kuopio, Jakobstad, and a private school for the GOae and 
dumb at Hvittis. (VII, p. 465.) 
The governmental schools for the deaf had 205 pupils in 1888-89, the 
private school, 20 pupils. Expenditures by the state, $10,558; for the 
school at Hvittis, $434. The two institutions for the blind (Blindan- 
stalter) had 54 pupils, and the state expenditures were $7,684. (I, p.110.) 
The course of study in these institutions extends from three to eight 
years. Information in regard to methods is wanting. 
A private institute for the education of idiots, in Jakobstad, had nine 
pupils—S wedes—in that year (1888-89). ‘To support this school $579 
were required. (I, p. 110; VII, p. 465.) ‘

X,.—HISTORICAL STATEMENT. 
The school system of Finland is distinct from that of Russia, of which 
Empire it is a grandduchy. Its main features are similar to those of 
Sweden, to which country it belonged until1809. Prior to 1611 educa- 
tion was under the control of the monks, as in Sweden; after that date 
the schools were subject to governmental regulations. (X, p. 213.) 
In 1630 the first gymnasium was founded at Abo. In 1640 a uni- 
versity was established at Abo, but on account of loss of the buildings 
_ by fire, it was removed to Helsingfors in 1827. According to its pres- 
ent constitution, decree of 1852, the government of the institution rests 
with the chancellor and consistorium. The Czar is really at the head 
of the university, but he is represented by one of the grand dukes. ‘The 
consistorium, composed of the rector and regular professors, attends 
to the internal management of the university. (X, pp. 213, 217; VIII, 
p. 401.) 5 
In 1649, 1693, and 1724 important school laws were passed, and in 
- 1686 an edict of Charles XI, which is still in force, required the clergy 
to hold an annual examination for the purpose of ascertaining whether 
the children of Finland could read, and whether, they knew their cate- 
chism. That law led to the establishment of schools for the common 
people, for it prohibited the marriage of parties who had not been con- 
firmed, and could neither read nor pass an examination in regard to 
‘the doctrines of the Lutheran Church. 
In 1780 the military school of Frederickshams was established, with 
a three years’ course and three years’ preparatory department; the 
graduates to eater a higher school of special service. (X, pp. 213- 
220.)
-P-A-G-E-305
  
       THE EDUCATIONAL sysTEM OF PINLAND. OT Dae: 
In 1812 ehtes navigation schools were created, The courses continue 
from the middle of October to the middle of April. In 1837 agricultural 
institutes are first mentioned. (X, p. 220.) 
In 1843 a new school law was promulgated, which was moditied by 
acts of 1856, 1862, and 1864. 
In 1847 the Holmen school at Helsingfors was established, but a 
reorganization took place in 1872. 
In 1858, April 19, a decree required rural communes to establish sta- 
tionary schools, governmental aid being guaranteed. From this year 
dates the first school for deaf mutes. (VII, p. 460; X, p. 220.) 
In1863 the first Teachers’ Association wasorganized. It heldmonthly - 
meetings, and its membership fee was $1.50 a year. (X, p. 221.) 
A normal school for teachers was established in 1863-64, in Jyvaskyla, 
which had for its director Uno Cygneus, the organizer of pein in- 
struction in Finland. (X, p. 214.) 
In 1863-64 the Government voted the necessary funds for carrying 
on the public schools. (VII, p. 461.) 
In 1865 a “ Folkskole-forordning” or school law was passed, which, 
with modifications in 1869 and 1872, withdrew the higher public schools 
from ecclesiastical supervision and control, and instituted a system of 
governmental supervision for all the schools of Finland. (X, p. 213.) 
A decree of May 11, 1866, definitely organized elementary instruction 
in Finland, each commune or district! being required to establish a suffi- 
cient number of schools for all children between seven and fourteen 
years of age, or to see that they were instructed in reading, spelling, 
and the catechism, either at home or in an ambulatory school. Govern- 
mental grants were to be withheld if the communal authorities failed 
to carry out this decree. (VI, p. 48; VII, pp. 460-461; X, p. 214.) 
This law also provided for three normal schools, the course to extend — 
through four years, the last one devoted to practice in model schools 
and kindergarten attached to theschools. During this year a school 
for the blind was founded at Helsingfors; the one at Kuopio dates 
from 1870. 
A law of 1869 created a central board of education (Ofverstyrelsen 
_ for Skolvasendet), consisting of a president and six members, two of 
whom were to be governmental officials, and the other four engaged in 
educational or scientific work. One of the four members was to super- 
vise? the common schools; the other three the higher schools. 
1 Finland for purposes of civil administration is divided into 8 liins (cireles or terri- 
torial divisions), which are again subdivided into 51 harader (districts for tax pur- 
poses), and again into 249 Linsmans (districts for other civil purposes). For ecclesias- 
tical purposes the country is divided into 3 dioceses (Abo, Borga, Kuopio), which con- 
tain 485 parishes. (X, p. 210.) 
2The position of supervisor of common schools was held at that date by Rev. Una 
Cygnus, who was commissioned by the Government to visit Sweden, Denmark, Ger- 
many, and Switzerland for the purpose of studying their common-school systems, 
preparatory to reorganizing the school system of Finland,

‘In 1871 a normal school for the education of women teachers was 
established in Ekenis; in 1873 a second normal, for male teachers, at 
Nykarleby ; in 1880 one at Kymdli, near Sordayala, for both sexes. 
(Xp. 213 ; VI, p, 460.) 
An act of 1872 classified the real schools, Wwopidtidh and higher schools 
for women under the heading “ Elementarliroverken;” the Real schools 
to receive pupils from nine to twelve years of age, to continue their ele- 
‘ mentary education and prepare them for special schools; the lyceums to 
include all the old gymnasiums and higher elementary schools; the 
‘ _ schools for women to instruct in similar subjects to those of the Real 
            school, with bookkeeping omitted. These schools were under the su- 
pervision of the central administration, and although public they were - 
not free, except to those who were unable to pay fees. Tuition fees 
varied according to studies pursued; in the lower classes of the Real 
schools the fees were $2.50 a year; inthe higher classes $5. Inlyceums 
and schools for girls $7.62 was considered a aauepite amount for tui- 
tion. (X, pp. 215-216.) i 
The university, according to the constitution of 1852, has the four fac- 
ulties: theology, law, medicine, and philosophy, each faculty awarding 
its own diplomas. 
To enter the university students must passa final examination at the 
lyceums, and an examination conducted by a committee of professors des- 
ignated by the academic authorities, The student is required to enroll 
himself in one of the four faculties, and in one of the six “ nations” 
into which the students are divided. These nations—“ Nylindska,” 
Savolaks-Karelska, Tavastlindska, Westfinska, Wiborgska, Osterbit- 
niska—indicate the subdivision of the duchy from which the students 
come. Each “nation” supervises the morals of its members, and its 
disciplinary power even extends to the suspension of a refractory mem- 
ber from the university for a period not exceeding 2 years. (X, p. 218.) 
The “nation” taxes its members for necessary expenses for both . 
special and general purposes. A professor or “inspektir,” designated: 
by the chancellor for a 3 years’ period, stands at the head of each 
of these bodies. His aid is a vice president elected by the members 
from among the graduates belonging to the nation. To obtain a 
regular professorship in any given faculty, the candidate must hold 
- the degree of doctor in that faculty and write a thesis on the subject 
he is to teach. To obtain the degree of doctor he must be an M. A,, 
and have submitted to a second examination. To be an extraordinary 
_ professor, a doctor’s degree and evidence of learning and ability are 
required. The senatus academicus requires satisfactory credentials 
of candidates for the position of docent or instructor. (X, p. 217.) 
_ Any change of university organization or statutes—those of 1852 
being still in vogue—must be examined by the academic authorities and 
senate, and then receive imperial sanction. (X, p. 497.) 
As regards technical education, it is stated that numerous agricul-
-P-A-G-E-307
    THE abuGarONAt: syst OF FINLAND, 
tural schools, as well as other special schools, have been opened since 
1863. Among them dairy-farming schools, forestry schools, a groom’s  — ‘ 
school (for theoretical and practical instruction in the breeding of 
horses), a cattle-breeder’s school, two schools of horticulture, and two 
farrier’s schools. There are also agricultural, chemical, and seed sta- 
‘tions in various parts of the country, where, for a nominal sum, the 
peasants and farmers can haye analyses made of the composition and 
agricultural value of the soil, etc., and can watch practical experiments: 
in gardening, forestry, and dairy farming. 
The growth of education within the last 20 years may be entered 
from the fact that, according to a statement made by a late traveler}, 
there are probably at the present moment not 5,000 persons is 
the grand duchy unable to read and write, and a large percentage of 
those who are inscribed in that category are not Finns. The ambu- 
latory school is still indispensable, however, as a single parish is— 
sometimes scattered over a dozen islands, but the stationary elementary 
school compares favorably with corresponding educational establish- _ 
ments in England and the United States. The teachings of the 
university and the discoveries of the laboratory are also brought within 
the reach of the humblest classes, while the peasants of the remotest 
hamlets have their paper, and so keep up with the world’s progress.

GENERAL VIEW. 
In the absence of full official information respecting education in’ 
Spain, various educational works and papers have been consulted for 
general information as to the condition and progress of the Spanish 
school system.’ These make it evident that Spain, which several cen-

turies ago reached its eet in learning, and whose university of Sala- 
“manca equaled the famous universities of other nations, is at the 
present time somewhat behind other civilized nations in respect to 
education. 
_ A law of September, 1857,' provided for a system of public primary 
instruction, which if fully developed would bear excellent fruit; but the 
practical application of this law has been sadly hindered and retarded 
by political disturbances and the resulting depletion of the treasury of 
the Government. 
The census of 1883 showed that 45 per cent. of the population above 
seven years of age were illiterates, a proportion surpassed only by Rus- 
sia, Roumania, Servia, Portugal, Bulgaria, and Turkey. This is a — 
sufficient proof that elementary education has not been widely diffused 
among the people. The educational statistics show a fair supply of 
teachers; for example, in 1880 there was 1 head teacher to every 120 
children of school age (4-14), and including assistants 1 teacher to every 
102 of the poprlation of school age. The inference is that the low con- 
dition of the people with respect to education comes largely from their 
_own indifference to the subject. In respect, however, to the diffusicn of 
education, Spain shows the same want of uniformity as is noticeable in 
other countries, certain communities having attained a much higher 
level of general intelligence than others. 
Liberal and broad-minded men, scientists, and philosophers have 
worked faithfully for several years to advance the cause of public in- 
struction, and to call the attention of the state and the public to the 
disheartening condition of education in general. 
          Since 1881 ‘several favorable changes have been made by the Gov- 
ernment, relative to school buildings and their equipment, and higher 
institutions have been established, so that the general prospects are more 
promising than formerly; but the latest results can not be shown as 
yet. 
Primary schools, how maintained.—Public and private primary schools ~ 
are maintained either by religious corporations and associations, or by 
communities, provinces, and the state. 
The law of 1857 made primary instruction obligatory upon all chil- 
dren and gratuitous for those who could not pay tuition fees; a law of 
. 1868 extended this gratuity to all pupils.? Parents are free to choose - 
whether their children shall be instructed in public or in private schools 
or at home. 
Secondary instruction.—Every province is obliged under the law to 
maintain one or two institwtos (i. e., classical schools for secondary in- 
struction). Each of these institutos has in affiliation with it or under 
the supervision of its officers a number of local colegios.

The enrollment in private primary schools, which in 1880 was 326,879, 
had fallen to 290,749 in 1885, or a decline of 11 per cent. The enroll- 
ment in both public and private schools in 1885 was 1,843,183, as eset 
as equivalent to 9 per cent, of the population (census of 1887), while the 
enrollment in private schools increased the number to 10 per cent. of 
that population.’ The average attendance, public and private schools 
included, does not show improvement, standing in 1880 at 73 per cent. 
Sr. Ibatiez notes the good effects of the compulsory law up to 1880.

ADMINISTRATION AND SUPERVISION. 
State authorities—According to the law of 1857 the highest educa- 
tional authority is the minister of education and public works, ete. 
(ministro de fomento); under him there is a general director with a 
council (consejo de instruccion publica), There is also at least one in- 
_ Spector for every province. These officers are appointed by the King 
and are responsible to the minister. In 1885 they numbered fifty for 
the inspection of primary schools, besides three general inspectors for 
normal schools.!

Local authorities. anes provines has : a provincial board of educa- 
tion (junta), and every town its local ‘board, consisting of the principal 
officers of the province or town, a priest, ana at least tivo heads of 
families: 
In 1885 the local juntas for primary instruction comprised 50,000 per- 
sons, of whom 48,264 could read and write, 352 could read but not 
write, and 1,384 could neither read nor write. 
  TEACHERS OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
Appointment, number, and classification.—From the report by Sefior 
Ibafiez it appears that teachers of public schools are appointed by the 
government, while teachers of private schools are appointed by the local 
juntas. 
The number of teachers engaged in public primary schools in 1880 
was 23,783 and in private schools 9,751, making a total force of 33,534. 
At the beginning of 1885 the teaching force for the public primary 
schools numbered 25,271 persons. At the earlier date there was 1 pub- 
lie primary school teacher for every 60 pupils enrolled, and for every 
43 pupils in average attendance, while in 1885 there was 1 teacher for 
every 61 pupils enrolled and for every 41 in average attendance. 
The force reported for 1885 was composed as follows: 
  
| Male. | Female. 
  
Head teachers 15, 842 7,390 Assistants... a Fei 917 1, 022 
      
Qualifications.—The decree of October 14, 1868, modifying the law of 
June 2, 1868, permitted Spaniards not provided with diplomas to give 
primary instruction, but the government has continued in a certain 
measure to exact a diploma or at least a certificate of its public teach- 
ers. The law provides that teachers must be at least twenty years of 
age and must give proof of good moral character. An idea of the guar- 
anties actually offered by the teachers may be formed from the number 
of teachers and assistant teachers who have nothing to show but a 
certificate of aptitude. These certificates are obtained by means of an 
examination before the local juntas or before the board of counsellors 
of the normal schools; that is to say, the certificates are obtained from 
persons who do not nndeestand anything about teaching. In 1880, ac- 
cording to Sefior Ibafiez, 67 per cent. of the teachers of public schools 
had obtained diplomas, 23 per cent. had only certificates of aptitude, 9 
per cent. had neither, while the status of a small proportion was un- 
known. The intellectual level of public school teachers is in general 
higher and their preparation more complete than is the case with private 
school teachers. In the same year, 1880, of the private school teachers 
38 per cent. had diplomas, 5 per aN, certificates of capacity, and 56 
per cent. neither.

The report for 1885 classifies the teachers of public schools with — 
respect to diplomas as follows: 
Ten thousand two hundred and forty-six masters had obtained diplo- 
mas, i. é., were profesores titulares ; 5,015 had only certificates of apti- 
tude; 581 had neither; 7,070 female teachers had diplomas, 143 certifi- 
cates, and 121 neither one nor the other. 
The proportion of teachers having diplomas increased slightly from 
1880 to 1885. 
Salaries of teachers.—Teachers’ salaries are very small and, owing to 
the exhaustion of the Spanish treasury, are paid irregularly. They 
ranged in 1880 from $24 to $386 per annum. 
In 1885, the distribution of teachers with respect to salaries was as 
follows: One hundred and eighty received an annual remuneration 
of $386; 1,450 received an annualremuneration of $212 to $328 ; 14,926 
less than $193; 8,715 from $24 to $81. 
Training of teachers.—Article 110 of the law of 1857 makes provision 
for the establishment of a primary normal school for the training of 
teachers in each of the principal cities of the provinces. 
Normal schools.—In 1885, 48 normal schools for men were maintained ; — 
20 in buildings specially devoted to the purpose and 20 in rented build- 
ings; 7,467 candidates presented themselves for final examination, 
some for national schools (enseranza oficial) and others for private 
schools (ensefanza libre). Of this number 6,008 were approved; 4,320. 
for elementary grades, 1,438 for superior elementary schools, and 250 
for normal elementary schools. Thirty-three normal schools were at 
the same time supported for the training of female teachers; 8,896 can- 
didates presented themselves for examination; 4,577 obtained certifi- 
cates for elementary schools; 2,574 obtained certificates for superior 
primary schools ; total, 7,151. 
Pensions.—Teachers of public schools are, by the law of 1857, entitled 
to a pension, and this right extends to their widows and orphans, The 
age for pensioning is sixty years, exceptions being made in severe cases 
of illness. All teachers of public primary schools are likewise en- 
titled to a respectable dwelling house, large enough to accommodate 
their families. ! : 
PRESCRIBED STUDIES AND ORGANIZATION OF PRIMARY SCHOOLS. 
The courses of studies in the elementary primary schools is substan- 
tially that prescribed by the law of 1857; it includes religion, scriptural 
history, reading, writing, the elements of Spanish grammar, and the 
rudiments of arithemetic. The superior primary course comprises the 
elements of geometry, of linear drawing and surveying, history and 
geography, chemistry, and natural history. 
Classification and distribution of schools.—In the category of public 
schools are included infant schools (escuelas de pdrvulos), primary day 
schools for children of six to fourteen years of age, Sunday schools for

The statistics of enrollment and attendance already given (p. 236) in- 
clude all the classes of schools; information as to their relative number 
in 1885 is wanting; the showing for 1880, which is presumably not far 
from the actual state at the end of the half decade, is of value, asit 
throws much light upon the conditions of school attendance. 
The classification of schools in that year was as follows:

  These schools were distributed irregularly throughout Spain, the 
number of inhabitants to a school varying greatly. In the province of 
Alava there were 265 inhabitants to each school district; in the prov- 
ince of Cadiz, 1,185. These numbers give the extremes; the general 
average in Spain at that date was 561 inhabitants for each school dis- | 
trict. Between 1850 and 1880 the number of schools was almost doubled, 
@ result undoubtedly of the law of 1857. In the period 1871-80, 5,828 
schools were established, but only 2,132 were permanent. 
In the institutions supported by the State education is free. 
The union of public and ecclesiastic agencies in the work of elemen- 
tary instruction is indicated by the following:

Nearly all these schools were pay-schools, 14 were supported by the 
contributions of the pupils, 2 by a society in London, 7 by other foreign | 
societies. As to the remainder, their sources of support are not Te: 
ported. 
These schools instructed 2,052 boys and 1,344 girls; their teaching 
force, small in number, consisted of 1 male or 1 female teacher for each 
school; 42 assistant teachers carry the total number of teachers to 106. 
School buildings and material.—Official regulations are issued prescrib- 
ing the minimum size and capacity of school-rooms, the modes of light- 
ing and ventilation, and the equipments, as follows: A platform 2 feet 
high and from 10 to 12 feet wide, with steps; @ writing desk and arm- 
chair for the teacher; a crucifix and the portrait of the king; a wall 
clock; two cases with shelves; two tables with chairs for the inspect- 
ors; six chairs for persons who visit the school; writing material; 
desks for the children 24 to 30 inches high and 12 to 14 broad, 3 to 4 
inches distant from the benches; the benches should be 14 to16inches » 
high and 6 inches wide. The table and bench form a single body with 
14 inches mean length. The space between the walls and the first row. 
of benches is 6 feet. Blackboards, slates with the number of the classes, 
reference books and apparatus with which to teach arithmetic, maps, ete., 
are objects belonging tu school-rooms according to the actual system, — 
A school-room holding 60 to 70 children should be 14 varas in length 
and 9 in width, or 11 metres 70 centimetres by 7 metres 52 centi- 
metres. 
The condition of the Spanish schools with respect to hygiene is unsat- 
isfactory, and the necessity is felt of selecting localities which will bet- 
ter unite the conditions of health and comfort required in school 
buildings. The private schools are as unhealthy as the public schools, 
In 1885 there were 1,375 public schools occupying buildings which were 
the property of the respective localities; 10,184 school buildings were 
mediocre or bad; 8,210 dwellings, designed for residences of teachers, 
were in a deplorable condition.   SECONDARY INSTRUCTION. 
The chief establishments for secondary instruction are the provincial 
institutos ; in affiliation with these are local colegios. 
According to a regulation of May 22, 1859, the directors of the institw- 
tos are nominated by the King from among the incumbents of university 
chairs, or if circumstances require, a director may be appointed from the mn 
rank of doctors or licentiates of science, philosophy, and letters. In 
some cases selection may be made of a person not having the specified 
degrees, but of recognized qualification for the duties. 
From the report of Sefior Ibaiiez it appears that in 1878-79 the prov- 
inces had edtablished 61 institutos (7. ¢., secondary classical schools), 
which, with 356 colegios, made a total of 417 secondary establishments.

Teachers of secondary schools.—The law of 1857 prescribed that all 
teachers in secondary schools should be at least twenty-four years of age 
and should hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The revolutionary 
government of 1868 required a competitive examination.’ 
In 1880 the number of professors in secondary institutions was 2,649 ; 
888 taught in institutos, 1,761 in private colleges. 
Pensions.—The provision of the law relative to pensions extends also 
to teachers of secondary schools. 
Course of studies.—Secondary instruction consists of two distinct 
courses, #. é., a course of general study and a course of applied study 
or practical course. The former is subdivided into two parts, the first 
comprising religion, scriptural history, reading, writing, universal and 
Spanish history, modern languages, Spanish and Latin grammar, com- 
position, the rudiments of Greek, logic, psychology, and drawing. The 
second part comprises religion and morals, analysis, exposition of texts, 
and composition in the Latin and Spanish languages, elementary course

history, logic, and psychology ; also modern languages. These studies 
prépare for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. 
The course of applied studies comprises linear and object drawing, - 
mercantile arithmetic, and all branches connected with agriculture, 
arts, trades, commerce, and navigation. In 1878-79 there were 69,325 
pupils undergoing the ordinary and special examinations; 9,247 were 
judged incompetent; 30,317 passable; 13,150 good; 9,184 remarkable; 
7,427 superior; 659 prizes were distributed, and 396 pupils were honora- 
bly mentioned ; 3,057 candidates received the diploma of bachelor. 
The institutos offer the instruction which leads to the degree of bach- ~ 
elor, forming the preparation for university courses ; a few institutos 
add to their programme preparatory courses in commerce and industry. 
“In order,” says Sr. Ibaiiez, ‘‘ that Spain may be brought to the intel- 
lectual level of other countries in Europe, it will be necessary to mul- 
tiply the institutos, to give a vigorous scope to technical instruction, 
to create everywhere schools of arts and trades. In this manner a 
large number of young people who do not devote themselves to a uni- 
versity career will find a practical secondary instruction, preparing 
them to follow agricultural and commercial pursuits, arts, and industry ; 
i. €., all vocations which form the veritable force of nations.” 
SUPERIOR INSTRUCTION. 
Superior instruction is given in the universities and special schools. 
The universities are ten in number: each has a faculty of law; each 
except Oviedo a faculty of medicine ; Madrid, Barcelona, Grenada and 
Santiago have schools of pharmacy ; Madrid, Barcelona, Grenada, Sala- 
manca, Seville and Saragossa faculties of pitlosoie and letters. 
In 1888-89 these ten universities had 9,737 students in the regular 
courses and 573 special students; there were also 6,050 students fol- - 
lowing private university courses, or a total of 15,787 students in 
courses of letters, philosophy, law, etc., as against 16,874 in 1878-79. 
The university faculties confer three degrees, viz: bachelor, licenti- 
ate, and doctor. The number conferred in 1878-79 was 2,257, of which 
2,008 were licentiate degrees. Very few students take the degree of 
doctor, the largest proportion being found among thestudents of science. 
The number of students who continued their studies far enough to 
receive the higher degrees in the year specified was as follows:

Bypenditures.—The State appropriates a sufficient sum to cover the 
expenditures of the universities and special public schools, the receipts 
from fees being passed over to the public treasury, Three faculties 
only make an exception to this rule, viz., the faculty of science and the 
faculty of medicine at Salamanca and the faculty of medicine at Se- 
ville, which are supported by the juntas (i.e. provincial and local coun- 
cils), The expenses of the universities are in general much greater than 
their receipts from fees. The universities of Madrid and Barcelona 
appear to be the only exceptions. The total expenditures for the ten 
universities in the scholastic year 1878-79 was:

Receipts.—The receipts consist of tuition fees, examination fees, and 
fees for diplomas. In 1878-79 the amounts from the first-named source 
was $169,928; and from the last two, $327.308, or a total of $497,236, 
These details are not given in the report for 1888-89, but the total 
reached the sum of $372,219. On an average $40,000 are used every 
year for the purchase of scientific material, scholarships, books, and 
divers prizes for the pupils. This sum is taken from the university fees. 
SPECIAL SCHOOLS. 
Professional schools, é. e. technical, art, and trade schools, constitute 
anoticeable feature of the public educational provision of Spain. These 
schools are conducted in accordance with special decrees, prescribing 
the courses of study and the conditions of admission and graduation. 
The following statistics show the number of these schools and their 
attendance as reported in 1888-89:

The income of the professional schools in 1888-89 was $41,464, and 
their expenditures $127,395. 
LIBRARIES. 
In concluding, it may be added that Spain possesses many popular 
libraries ; 678 of these establishments, containing 104,909 works, or 
114,075 volumes, were opened from 1869 to 1880, The Government has 
also tried to instruct prisoners by means of libraries introduced in the 
reformatory establishments; 9,130 volumes are at present at the dis- 
posal of thé prisoners.

EDUCATION IN BRAZIL. _ 249 
I.—GENERAL FEATURES OF THE SOHOOL SYSTEM. 
The system of public instruction in Brazil includes elementary,' sec- 
ondary, and higher schools in Rio de Janeiro and throughout the prov- 
inces, the organization in Rio serving as model for the provinces. 
(VI, p. 267; VII, pp. 278-9, 152.) 
Elementary schools are subdivided into two grades, inferior and su- 
perior. The completion of the elementary course of study leads to the 
secondary grades, and these to the higher grades. Normal schools for 
the training of teachers, professional schools for technical and indus- 
trial education, and also special schools for the defective classes are — 
found. (VII, pp. 278-9.) Supplementary to these institutions, as aids 
to intellectual growth, are school and public libraries and museums, 
while numerous societies have as their object the establishment of 
schools for the instruction of the masses in the ordinary school 
branches and for certain industrial pursuits. (V1, pp. 845-850, 748- 
794.) The present educational system is based upon the constitution 
of 1824, and upon laws of 1851 and 1854, although later decrees have 
brought about modifications of those laws. Elementary instruction is 
gratuitous. (VII, p. 278.) 
Control.—The schools are under the control of both state and local 
authorities, the central administration at headquarters being a branch 
of the Ministry of Postes and Telegraphs (Ministerio dos Negocios). 
Since the establishment of the republic a minister of education is in 
charge of educational affairs. As auxiliaries there are inspectors-gen- 
eral and a higher council of education. This central authority has con- 
trol of elementary and secondary-schools in the “ Municipio Neutro” 
(Rio de Janeiro and its environs), and of higher education throughout 
‘the provinces. Each province has charge of its elementary and sec- 
ondary schools, the provincial assembly arranging school affairs, ex- 
cept in the case of the higher institutions. (VII, pp. 152, 278; I, pp. 1- 
21; VIII, p. 267.) 
The governor of the province fills the place uf a provincial minister of 
education. He is aided by superintendents, inspectors, school com- 
mittees, and local committees. (VII, p. 278.) 
Maintenance.—The schools in the Federal District are maintained by 
the Government, those in the provinces by the municipalities and pro- 
vincial legislatures. Private schools are also under the supervision of 
the authorities, and can only be opened by their consent. For a more 
complete exposé of the system, see under the different heads below. 
(VII, p. 278; XIV, pp. 391, 392.) 
IL—STA'TISTICS. 
‘ ‘With a population of 14,002,335 (in 1888) and a school population 
of 1,902,455 (in 1881) Brazil has only about 2 per cent. of its population   
1 By decree of April 19, 1879, each district of the ‘‘Municipio Neutro” (Rio and its 
environs) was to have a kindergarten.

MORO a ee EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-99. 
in school (XIV, pp. 391-2), due in part to the distance between schools 
in poorly settled districts and in part to a want of united effort on the 
part of the authorities in regard to school matters, (VI, pp. 1056-1098.) 
The number of children registered (inscripgdes) in 1888-89 as receiv- 
ing elementary instruction (instrucgio primaria) in the Municipio Neu- 
tro and in the provinces was 266,100 in 8,064 schools, but a careful 
investigation of the tabulated statements from the different provinces 
shows that this number includes pupils in asylums, apprenticeship 
schools, schools established by aid societies, evening schools, two agri- 
cultural schools, a farm school, etc. Separated from these institutions 
the numbers read: Public elementary schools (escolas publicas), 6,530; 
pupils, 207,973; private schoois (escolas particulares), 989; pupils, 
29,846. The private schools include subsidized and non-subsidized 
schools. The secondary and higher grades (escolas secundarias e su- 
perior) grouped together present a total of 24,898 students in 138 
schools. Included in this number are 25 normal schools (escolas nor- 
maes) with 3,544 pupils; the college of Dom Pedro II, which is a sort © 
of faculty of letters, has 569 students; the 2 faculties of medicine (fac- 
uldade de medicina) report 240 students (at the faculty in Rio), and 
705 at Bahia; the 2 faculties of law (faculdade de direito) report 535 
students at Sio Paulo (in 1884) and 858 at Récife; the polytechnic 
(escola polytechnica) has 161 students, and the school of mines at Ouro 
Preto (escola de minas de Ouro Preto) has 79 students, Included also 
under the totals for secondary and higher education are military and 
nayal schools, theological schools, each diocese having a seminary for 
theological instruction, lyceums, and schools established by various 
societies. (VI, pp. 1020-1053; I, pp. 1-104 and A-B.) 
The elementary school age is nominally from 6 to 15 years, but in 
reality the lower elementary grades are open to children of 5 years of 
age, while an extension of from 12 to 18 years of age is accorded to 
the higher elementary grades. (VI, p. 278.) ’ 
Coeducation is not allowed by law, the boys being taught by men 
and the girls by women, but about the year 1885 Dom Pedro IE estab- 
lished a number of schools where boys and girls recited together, but 
outside of the recitation rooms they were kept apart. About 500 of 
these schools are reported in 1888-89. (VI, pp. 520, 708-721, 1020- 
1053; VII, p, 278.) 
III.—FINANCES. 
Income.—The schools are supported by taxes imposed by the central 
government, as voted by the Chamber of Deputies, seconded by local 
taxation in each province. The government provides for the elemen- 
tary and secondary schools of Rio and its environs, and for higher 
education throughout the Republic. The provincial authorities pro- 
vide the funds for elementary and secondary schools of the provinces 
(XI, p. 183; IX, p. 238; XIV, p. 392), The amounts voted for the

schools vary in the different provinces as the authorities realize the’ 
‘need of funds to carry ont the plan of gratuitous instruction imposed 
by the constitution, of providing free text-books, and of clothing poor 
children so that they ean attend school. In high schools and colleges 
afeeischarged. The provincial and state funds amounted to $5,639,255 
in 1888. In 1887-88 the budget for Rio and environs was $305,858. 
(XIV, p. 574; VII, p. 278; XI, 183; VI, p. 1054.) P 
Hupenditures.—The expenditures for school purposes throughout 
Brazil have averaged, according to tabulated statements, over $5,000,000 
annually during the last 5 years, that is from 1884 to 1889 (VI, p. 
1054). The total expenditures for public instruction in 1889 in the 20 
provinces and the federal district, or Municipio Neutro (VII, p. 278), 
which includes Rio and its environs, were $5,217,539; the expenditures 
by the government at the same date for elementary, secondary, and 
higher instruction were $1,746,153, but this does not include expendi- 
tures for professional education in the military arsenals, for text-books 
of a scientific character, and other similar expenses. The state 
expenditures for higher education throughout the Empire were 
$405,234 in 1889, The state and provincial appropriations for the 
year 1890 were $5,310,841; government alone $1,913,383, The amounts 
to be expended for teachers’ wages, incidentals, etc., are not specified. 
(VI, pp. 1054-1056, tables.) 
IV.—SUPERVISION AND ADMINISTRATION, 
State.—Edueation is under state and local supervision. An inspec- 
_ tor-general! of public instruction, who forms with his aids a division of 
the “‘ ministerio dos negocios” has direct charge of the schools in the 
Municipio Neutro. This central administration, which has also a 
governing influence over education throughout the country, consists of 
the inspector-general, and a higher council of studies composed of well 
known educators, four of its members being subject to election and 
seventeen being persons delegated by the district authorities, eleven of 
them from Rio alone (VII, pp. 152, 278). The inspector-general, who 
fulfils the functions of a minister of education, can neither be a pro-, 
’ fessor nor a director of an institution. His duties are to have charge, 
either personally or through the members of the higher council, or 
through the delegates in the different provinces, of all educational in- 
stitutions of Brazil; to preside at the examinations of professors and 
instructors and confer diplomas; to authorize the opening of schools 
and revise classical text-books or to replace them by others, if need be; 
to combine the reports forwarded to him from the different provinces 
with his owa, and compare them with his annual report of education in 
the Municipio Neutro, so as to observe how far the schools of the federal

_ district have served as models for the schools of the provinces; to so 
organize public instruction at the capital that it may serve as a model 
for the provinces; to prepare regulations by which all schools are t: 
be governed and to formulate rules for the examination of professors 
-and assistant teachers; to appoint teachers, and indicate when their 
_ salaries shall be increased and when they shall be pensioned; to sug- 
. gest the establishment of elementary schools, and to indicate when it 
is advisable to extend the course in the college of Dom Pedro II by the 
establishment of new chairs. (VI, pp. 266-270.) 
_ The council of education, with the inspector-general as presiding 
officer, has for its duties the investigation’ of the best methods and 
systems of public instruction, the choice and revision of text-books, 
discipline in private and public schools, the form and programme for 
examinations, etc. The council is consulted in regard to all subjects 
appertaining to elementary and secondary instruction. (VI, p. 268.) 
In the capital, elementary and secondary schools are under the direct 
supervision of the minister. In the provinces he delegates his authority 
to the head of the provincial government. (VII, p. 152.) 
Local.—Each province has its provincial assembly, which decides 
questions appertaining to elementary and secondary education. The 
governor of a province—there are twenty provinces—is in charge of 
public instruction in that province. He is aided by superintendents or 
_ general inspectors, while, as local officers, there are district school 
committees and local committees, which usually have twe teachers 
“emeritus ”—that is, those who have had twenty years’ service as 
teachers—connected with them (VII, pp. 278, 286). The superintend- 
ents visit annually all the schools in their division, and each one pub- 
lishes an annual report. The district delegates visit the schovls once a 
month, and report to the minister every three months (VII, p. 152) 
The local school committee attends to the management of the schools. 
Private schools are also under the supervision of the school authorities 
and must submit to inspection as far as morality and hygiene are con- © 
cerned, (VII, p. 278.) 
‘V.—TEACHERS. 
Preparation.—Teachers are prepared for the position which they de- © 
sire to occupy either at the College of Dom Perro II, or at the “ Hsco- 
Jas Normaes” (normal schools) in Rio and in the provinces (X, p. 164). 
There are also pedagogical courses connected with several secondary 
schools. (VII, p. 278.) 
Examinations and licensing.—The diploma of the normal school, or of 
the courses in pedagogy in secondary schools, is a prerequisite for the 
teacher’s position (VII, p. 286). If, however, the applicant be a col. 
lege graduate a special license may be obtained. If he be a foreigner 
he must have a diploma from a university or pass an examination (XI, 
t 
     
-P-A-G-E-325
  4 
EDUCATION IN BRAZIL. B53. ae 
p.183). <A certificate is accorded after a certain number of years’ serv- 
ice as assistant teacher in the lower elementary grades, if the theoret- 
ical and practical examination is passed, and this certificate is required 
if an increase of salary is desired. The questions for the examination 
of teachers are determined each year by the Council of Studies (VII, p. 
286). Candidates for the position of teacher must be at least twenty- 
one years of age, and twenty-five years if the aspirant desires to be the 
principal of a school. (X, p. 164; XII, pp. 45, 46.) 
Appointment.—The Government appoints teachers throughout the 
country and they are chosen from the graduates of normal schools or 
from the assistant teachers who have passed the requisite examinations 
for assistant teachers in lower-grade schools, receiving a diploma for the 
same, and who have had at least three months’ experience. After five 
‘years’ service a teacher may be appointed for life. Changes in location 
are authorized by the provincial department of instruction. (VII, p. 
279; XI, p. 183). 
- In order to open a private school the teacher must be provided with a 
certificate of morality and capacity. (VII, p. 278.) 
Salaries.—Teachers’ salaries are said to be the same for men and 
women. If the third examination has been passed, teachers receive 
about $33 a month salary; prior to that, as assistants, they get from $15 
to $30 a month. (VII, pp. 278, 279, 286.) 
_ Marked differences in salary are noticeable, however. The largest 
cities pay at least $579 a year to a lower-grade teacher, and from $675 
to $739 to elementary teachers of the higher grade. In the city of Rio 
a higher grade of salary is reached, howeyer. Free lodging and ground 
around the house are also allowed. For each pupil who succeeds in 
passing the examination, a certain premium is accorded to the teacher. 
When the regulation number of 30 per class is exceeded, 33 cents a 
month is accorded to the instructor for each boy added to the class 
limit, and 50 cents a month for each additional girl. (VII, p. 279.) 
Teachers’ pensions.—A fter ten years’ service as a teacher, a pension is 
accorded which is sufficient for the teacher to insure his life. After fif- 
teen years’ service the amount is augmented 25 percent.; after twenty 
years, he becomes a teacher “emeritus.” (VII, p. 279.) 
Teachers’ institutes.—A decree establishing “conferencias pedagogicas” 
(teachers’ conferences) was promulgated in 1872, and as a result of this 
decree, the first conferences were held in Rio in 1873. These gather- 
ings seemed to be of great interest to teachers, and many pedagogical 
questions were discussed, among them, the subject of coeducation. 
Over 500 of these conferences were reported in Brazil between the dates 
1872 and 1889. (VI, pp. 514-520, 852-860.) 
i. In 1883 the “‘ Congresso do Instruecao,” held in Rio, brought together 
the most prominent educators of the country. (VI, p. 783.) 
This association was divided into two sections, the first taking up 
questions appertaining to elementary, secondary, and professional edu- 
cation; the second section discussing higher education, The discus-

- sions covered reorganization, courses of study in different grades, nor- 
mal training, technical branches, etc, Educational progress in other 
nations was brought before the assembly in the various papers pre- 
sented. An outgrowth of this congress was the ‘'Primiera Exposiccao 
Pedagogica do Rio de Janeiro,” held in 1884. This, the first pedagog- 
ieal exhibit of the country, was stated to be of incalculable benetit to 
~ teachers, as by means of it they were able to form some estimate of 
progress in education as realized in other countries. (III, pp. 17,18; 
; VI, pp. 810-814.) 
  VI.—COURSES OF STUDY. 
_ The grades of schools are, as stated above, the elementary, which 
with its two divisions corresponds with the primary and grammar 
grades of the United States; the secondary, which corresponds with 
i the high and academic grades of the United States; and the schools 
for higher education (XI, p. 183). Olassed under elementary, on 
account of the course of study, are a few normals and lyceums, the 
remainder coming under secondary or higher instruction. Also classed 
under secondary instruction are asylums for those who have no one to 
eare for them, although not necessarily orphans (VII, p. 785), evening 
_ schools for adults, and preparatory schools for apprentice boys desiring 
to enter the naval or military service (VI, pp. 1020-1053). The 
schedule of studies for all elementary institutions includes: 
      Lower grade primaries. Higher grade primaries.

(VII, 278.) - (VII, p. 278.) 
By decree of April 19, 1879,! the following branches were added for 
‘the elementary schools in the “Municipio Neutro,” which, as before 
stated, serve as a model for similar grades in the provinces:

EDUCATION IN BRAZIL. OBE, 
The secondary schools include in their course of study Portuguese, 
French, Bnglish, and Latin languages ; arithmetic, algebra, geometry, 
and trigonometry; geography, history, rhetoric, mental and moral phi- 
losophy (XI, p. 183). 
The College of Dom Pedro II, which oceupies the highest rank among 
secondary institutions, has a seven-years’ course of study in two divi- \ 
sions leading to the degree of B. lit., and admitting to higher schools 
without other examination (XX, p. COLIX). Its course of study is as fol- 
lows: Languages, Latin, Greek, English, French, German, and Italian; 
literature, Portuguese language and literature; rhetoric and poetry, 
mental and moral philosophy; history, general and national; geogra- 
phy, cosmography, and chorography of Brazil; arithmetic, algebra to 
equations of second degree, geometry, and trigonometry ; natural, sci- 
ences, physics, and chemistry; drawing, music, dancing, and gymnas- 
ties, (VI, p. 275; X, p. 167.) 
The normal schools vary in character, but, as in other countries, their 
main object is to prepare teachers for both city and rural schools. In 
order that the normal students may be cognizant of the products of the 
earth and of the industries appertaining thereto, courses in horticul- 
ture were established in some of the schools similar to courses reported 
in France, Austria, and Germany (VI, pp. 743-744). The regular course 
of study in the higher class normals in Brazil may be judged from a 
proposed reorganization of the ‘Escola Normal da Corte” at Rio, as 
suggested at the “Oongresso do Instruccao” of 1883. The course, to 
cover four years, is as follows: 
Science and letters. | Course in arts. 
Portuguese and French languages and 
national literature. (Additional branches.) 
    ‘ Drawing. Geography and history. Galipra shy 
Mathematics through elements of me- | 45,45, ; 
chanics. Mae) ore “ Gymnasties. Moral and civic education. Sewing. 
Pedagogy and methods. 
Astronomy and physies, chemistry and 
elements of mineralogy. 
Biology, with elements of botany and | 
zovlogy. 
Sociology; socialand domestic economy. (IU, pp. 26-27.) 
This proposed reorganization must have been carried out in part, as it 
is stated that a decree of October 13, 1888, modified this plan to a certain 
extent. The course was to be limited tothreeyears. Thestudies were to 
include religion, moral and civic education, with elements of political 
economy; Portuguese, elements of Portuguese history and literature; 
French; geography, particularly that of Brazil history, and above all 
that of Brazil to the present day; arithmetic and elements of algebra ; 
“bookkeeping for pupil teachers; geometry, elements of physics, chem-

_istry, botany, zodlogy, and geology, with the principal applications of 
these sciences; writing, drawing, vocal music; manual training for 
pupil teachers, and sewing for girls; gymnastics and military exercises. 
Criticisms of this change in the course of study were noticed, and it 
may not have been carried out. (VI, pp. 962-963.) 
Classed under higher education are the two faculties of medicine at 
Rio and Bahia, which with a six-years’ curriculum cover medicine and 
surgery, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany and zodlogy, gynxcol- 
ogy, and pharmaceutics (IX, p. 239; X, p. 197). The two faculties of law 
haveeach a five-years’ course covering natural and administrative laws, 
civil, public,’ Roman, ecclesiastical, constitutional, criminal, and commer- 
cial laws; also procedure before the courts, political economy, etc., (I, pp. 
11,12; XIX; XVIII). The polytechnic school, a development since 1874 
of the ‘‘ Escola Centrale,” in which school were taught scientific branches 
and military engineering, has undergone many transformations since 
that period. In addition to its preparatory and general courses, it has 
_@ special three-years course for natural sciences, a similar one for 
mathematics, one for engineers and geographers, one for civil engineers, 
one for mining, and one for arts and industries. Its laboratories are 
especially well equipped (IX, p. 239; XII, pp. 45, 46; VIII, p. 657). 
The “ Escola de Minas de Ouro Preto” includes in its'‘elementary course 
arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry, physics, chemistry, botany, 
and zodlogy ; in its higher course, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, min- 
ing, mechanics, descriptive geometry, analytical geometry, topography 
and surveying, geology, assaying, metallurgy, applied mechanics, stere- 
otomy, and the securing excavations with timber (IV, p. 165). There 
are courses of study in naval construction in the higher national schools. 
The higher branches of military science and engineering, which formerly 
were taught in the central college, are now a part of the polytechnic 
course, and there are regular schools for military and naval science, 
artillery practice, ete. (IX, p. 239.) 
VIL—ScHOOL MANAGEMENT AND METHODS OF DISCIPLINE. 
Methods and management.—In regard to school management itis stated 
that by a decree of November 6, 1883, enforced from January, 1884, the 
following regulations were applied to the lower elementary schools of 
‘the “ Municipio Neutro,” which schools, as mentioned above, are models 
for the whole country. The principal is responsible for the manage- 
ment of the school. A teacher usually has charge of about 30 children, 
although 40, and sometimes 50 boys or girls are under the charge of one 
teacher. If there are more than 50 pupils he must have an assistant; 
if more than 100 pupils, 2 assistants, and 3 assistants if there are 150

pupils. The principal | must by his example inculcate habits of neat- 
noss, morality, and good breeding. He must be at his desk 15 minutes 
before school opens, and-remain until the close of school. He must 
inaintain order and regularity in the class, and try to make himself be- 
loved by his pupils. He must be ever ready to furnish verbal or writ- 
ten information to the authorities in regard to schools, and permit 
persons to visit the classes, if no disturbance is caused by it. He 
mast report at the end of each trimester as to the enrollment and aver- 
age attendance. He must see that religious instruction! limits itself to | 
the sign of the eross, the Lord’s prayer, and the angelical salutation re- 
d at the opening of the school for the lowest class; for the second 
class, the apostles’ creed and a prayer to the virgin are to be added; 
    
for the higher class, the ten commandments, and those of the church, - 
the works of charity, and the seven sacraments. Added to this, moral 
teachings are to beinculeated mostly by example, and it is considered 
the duty of the principal to thoroughly imbue his pupils with the love 
»f God, love of country, ete. (VI, pp. 803-807.) 
Discipline—A general statement in regard to management and 
methods throughout the country is as follows: Corporal punishment is 
positively forbidden in the schools. (XI, p. 183; VII, p. 278.) If the 
teachers do not properly fulfill their functions they are subject to cen- 
sure, suspension, dismissal, and in extreme cases they are forbidden to 
teach again. (II, p. 366.) 
Promotion of pupils.—Promotions are made from elementary to sec- 
ondary schools through examinations given by the teachers; from the 
secondary to the higher grades on the basis of governmental examina- 
iions arranged by the minister of education, 4. ¢., the inspector-general. 
Qu, p. 183.) 
Formation of school programmes.—The formation of school pro- 
gi ammes is left to the principal, and no elementary school of either 
evade can be opened until the Government has been informed in regard 
tothe programme of studies. (X, p. 165.) 
Text-books are provided by the department of public instruction, and 
the best text-books in use are translated from French, German, and 
Huglish sources; still, any book may be adopted save those expressly 
forbidden. (XI, p. 183; X, p. 165.) 
VIIL—ScHOOL ORGANIZATION. 
Buildings and grounds.—Public edifices are constructed from the 
plans and under the direction of national architects, and it is stated 
that city schoolhouses are fairly well built. (VI, p.xxtv.) In the rural 
districts an inferior class of buildings is reported. (XI, p. 183.) The 
  
+Since the establishment of the Republic religious instruction is omitted in the 
state schools, and these religious exercises may possibly be omitted also, although 
this is not distinctly stated. (XVI, p. 94.) :

size of rooms, seating of papils, and conduct of schools have been dis- 
ussed by those interested in bringing about educational reforms in 
Brazil, but the decisions are not known to date. (II, pp. 336-340.) 
Hours of school—Holidays.—The hours for school are from 9 to 12 
a. m., and 2 to 5 p. m., Monday to Saturday inelusive, except on na- 
tional and religious holidays. What these holidays are is not specified. 
A month’s vacation in the schools at Christmas is reported, however, 
(XI, p. 183.) 
Compulsory attendance.—Attendance is compulsory in the schools, and 
in the larger cities where there are graded courses the law is carried 
out to a certain extent. Most of the provincial councils have also voted 
for this measure, but have been unable to enforce it. (VII, p. 278.) 
No distinction is made in schools as to color; blacks and whites are - 
admitted on equal terms. (XI, p. 183.) 
IX.—SUPPLEMENTARY INSTITUTIONS. 
SLnbraries and musewns.—Among the institutions which serve as aids 
to intellectual growth are the “Museu Nacional” at Rio with its 
ethnological and paleontological collections, and the “ Bibliotheca Na- 
cionale,” which possesses 170,631 volumes, 1,761 specimens of Brazilian 
flora, 30,000 engravings, 12,000 manuscripts, ete. (VI, p. 845.) There 
are also many school and society libraries in Rio, and in the larger 
cities of the provinces public libraries supported by the provincial au- 
thorities. In addition there are libraries connected with the majority 
of colleges and academies. Provincial museums, too, are quite numer- 
“ous, many of them containing material especially valuable to those who 
‘are carrying on scientific or educational work. (XI, pp. 45, 46.) In 
Rio the Museu Escolar Nacional,” established in 1883, has, as its stat- 
utes indicate, five sections, viz: (1) Legislative, administrative, and 
statistical documents relating to education. (2) Didactic and other 
pedagogical works. (3) Plans for the construction of school buildings. 
(4) Types of school furniture. (5) School furnishing and apparatus, 
models, geographical, scientific, and technalpare? collections, etc. (V, 
‘pp. 1-7, 1-9; VI, pp. 810-816.) 
Societies. —Other aids to progress in education are educational and 
scientific societies in Rio and the provincial capitals. (VI,pp. XXIx, Xxx.) 
Among them are the ‘ Instituto Historico, Geografico e Ethnografico” 
(Historical, Geographical, and Ethnological Institute) of Brazil; the 
“Gabinete Portuguez de Leitura,” with over 70,000 volumes in its 
library; the “Sociedade Propagadora das Bellas Artes” (Society for 
Art Culture) with its schools ; the “Conservatorio de Musica” (Conserv- 
atory of Music); the “Sociedade Amante da Instrucgaio” (Society for 
Promoting Education), which maintains several elementary schools, . 
and an asylum for orphans, and has courses in French, Latin, steno- 
graphy, linear drawing, music, ete.; the “ Lyceu Litterario Portuguez,” 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
    “EDUCATION IN BRAZIL. 259 
which has professional courses, and aims in every way to develop popu- — 
lar education. (VI, pp. 748, 760-768, 928-933; I, pp. 64-67.) There are 
‘many other societies with a similar object in view, and also numerous — 
lectiire courses on scientific subjects, for which a merely nominal fee is 
charged. (XII, pp. 45, 46.) 
School savings aks; —School savings banks were established by a . 
decree of April 19,1879, which called for such institutions in each school ~ 
district of Rio. In the province of Pernambuco a decree regulating © 
public instruction instituted school savings banks as a part of the regu- 
lar school programme. ‘The statute refers to them as “of great educa- 
tional value,” and as “of the utmost importance in connection with 
a thorough civic education.” (VI, pp. 645-646; XXL) 
Schools for special classes.—As a means of educating the special classes 
there are such schools as the “ Instituto dos Surdos Mudos ” (Institute 
for the Deaf and Dumb), which, founded in 1826, and supported by the 
_ Government since 1868, has an elementary course of study, and gives 
instruction in boot and shoe making, bookbinding, horticulture, and 
floriculture ; the “Instituto dos Meninos Cégos” (Institute forthe Blind), 
with both elementary and secondary courses, and with complete instruc- 
tion in vocal and instrumental music, harmony, rules of counterpoint 
and instrumentation, typographical art, bookbinding, and piano-tuning, 
and for the girls needle-work; the asylums maintained by the “ Socie- 
dade Portugueza de Beneficencia;” by the “ Sociedade S. Francisco de 
Paula;” by the “Sociedade Amante de Instrucgao”—all of which have 
_ elementary courses and generally instruction leading to a trade. Added 
to these is the institute “ Providencia,” where the native population of 
the provinces of Amazona and Para is taught such trades as black- 
smithing, carpentry, tailoring, the mason’s and locksmith’s trade, ete. 
They also receive instruction in the elementary branches, the rights of 
_ citizenship, and Christian doctrine. (VI,pp. 983-992, 846-847, 971-973, 
1006-1010, 750-752; X, pp. 201-206; I, pp. 62-63.) f 
X.— HISTORICAL STATEMENT, 
The history of education in Brazil may be traced to the advent of the 
Jesuits from Portugal, in 1549, and the establishment of numerous 
schools by that order in different parts of the country, during the period 
preceding the events which led to the expulsion of the Order in 1758-60, - 
A schooi founded by one of the fathers at Sio Vicente may be said to 
be the cradle of elementary instruction in Brazil. At the beginning of 
the eighteenth century are noticed the first traces of official intervention 
in regard to the studies directed by the Jesuits. The municipality con- 
trolled education until the first quarter of the present century. Since 
then a tendency towards centralization is noticeable. In 1730 instruct- 
ors and professors were called “ ministros de lettras,” and were con- 
sulted by the highest authorities. Secondary studies at an early date

were found only in Episcopal seminaries, where arithmetic, algebra, 
geometry, Latin, Greek, rhetoric, and philosophy were studied. For 
higher branches students went to the University of Coimbra, in Portu- 
gal. The secularization of education in the early part of the eighteenth 
century brought about the so-called “Letters Patent,” which aimed at 
reorganizing the studies of Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and rhetoric, and to 
bring about a higher intellectual development. Royal letters of No- 
vember 10, 1772, established a “literary subsidy ” for the special main- 
tenance of primary schools. This was supplemented by a decree of 
October 17, 1795, by which the municipal authorities were to use the 
, amount raised by such taxation for the payment of teachers and pro- 
fessors. And again, on July 6, 1797, the subsidy was placed under the 
control of the boards of finance of that period (VI, pp. 3, 9-13, 22-45, 
58, 60-63). In 1816 this library subsidy was repealed; on March 16, 
1816, a director-general of studies was created, and the municipal 
chambers ceased to have a direct influence upon education (VI, pp. 60- 
63). 
From 1808 to 1818 date many of the higher institutions of learning, 
such as a naval academy in 1808; medical and surgical courses in 1809; 
in‘1812 a medical and surgical board, which could confer the bacca- 
laureaute and doctor’s degrees; in 1814 schools of agriculture and 
botany and a commercial school; in 1813 the nucleus of a public 
library at Rio, formed by the sending of 50,000 volumes from Lisbon ; 
in 1818 the National Museum at Rio was established. During this 
same period elementary education was not neglected, and according to 
the law of October 20, 1823, any citizen could open an elementary school 
without having to pass an examination or obtain any license or author- 
ization. Monitorial schools according to the Lancastrian system were 
next attempted, and a ministerial decree of August 22, 1825, urged the 
necessity of establishing such schools. (VI, pp. 96, 100-106, 132, 
163-167.) The next step was to formulate a law—October 15, 1827— 
by which a sufficient number of elementary schools for those desiring 
to attend school were to be established in cities, towns, and populated 
districts. From the formation of the constitution in 1824 to the laws 
of 1851 and 1854, which form the basis of the present educational sys- 
tem in Brazil, various progressive efforts weremade. In the provinces 
the general councils of education created elementary schools for both 
boys and girls and founded chairs for secondary instruction, which in- 
eluded the studies of philosophy, rhetoric, geometry, French, and agri- 
culture; faculties of medicine were created in 1832 to take the place 
of the former courses in medicine (VI, pp. 177-186); reforms in the 
constitution in 1834 brought about a number of laws and decrees ap- 
pertaining to education, but there was little plan or method in the 
‘arrangements made (VI, p. 191); teachers’ wages were increased in 
Rio, but suitable training for teachers by means of normal schools, ete., 
was not chronicled till a later date. (VI, pp. 193-195.) In 1836 a
-P-A-G-E-333
T

EDUCATION IN BRAZIL. 261 
special control and inspection of elementary schools in the capital were _ 
established, and a director of schools free from municipal surveillance 
was created. (VI, p. 196.) From 1837 date the first attempts towards 
. a faculty of philosophy in the establishment of the Collegeof Dom 
Pedro II. (VI, pp. 237-249.) In 1840 with the advent of ‘Dom Pedro 
IL upon the throne (XVII, p. 110), new constitutional reforms were ef- 
fected. At that date Brazil had a population of 6,000,000 inhabitants. 
As 2,500,000 of them were natives and slaves they formed no part of the 
school population, but even then only about1 school to 520 pupils was 
reported. (VI, p. 229.) This lack of schools was so manifest that in 
1845 the Government was authorized to furnish funds for school build- 
ings and apparatus, and in 1847 a commission was appointed to visit 
both public and private schools—the Government’s intervention in pri- 
vate schools is here noticed for the first time. * (VI, p. 233.) To the pres- 
ent day more attention had been given tosecondary and highereducation 
than to the elementary grades, and a reorganization of elementary in- 
struction was said to be absolutely essential. A vote of the Chamber ~ 
of Deputies, September 17, 1851, gave the Government full power to 
reorganize elementary education in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, 
and this act was supplemented by a decree of February 17, 1854, which 
holds good to the present time. These decrees extended public instruc- 
tion, exacted better training for teachers, required proofs of capacity, 
investigated the pay of teachers, regulated private instruction, ap- 
pointed inspectors for the schools of the capital, and placed the organ- 
ization of secondary instruction in charge of the provincial assemblies. 
(VI, pp. 229-239.) From 1854 on, general progressive movements were 
noted in schools of the provinces, and extraordinary efforts were made 
by the Government to develop public instruction in all parts of the Em- 
pire. Evening schools were opened for adults and day workmen. Meth- 
ods of instruction in the capital were improved upon; additionalschools — 
were opened ; new school buildings supplied with modern apparatus were 
built; the best text-books adopted by the authorities were translated 
from French, German, -and English sources ; teachers’ salaries were in- 
creased; poor children were given suitable clothing so that they could 
attend school, and even text-books were furnished them; large sums of 
money were voted annually by the Government for higher instruction 
throughout the Empire, and for elementary and secondary instruction in 
thecapital and its environs. (VI, pp. 1054-1056 ; XV, p.540; VII, p. 278.) 
With the abolition of slavery in 1871, special measures were taken to 
educate all children born tothatclass. (VII, p. 278.) Progressin higher 
intellectual development was brought about by the fact that in Brazil, as 
in other countries—Germany and Italy, for instance—many situations 
under Government require proficiency in practical mathematics and nat- 
ural history, and hence a taste for such studies’ was encouraged. The 
advent of foreign engineers and naturalists also gave the people knowl- 
edge of late achievements in Europe in regard to mathematical and ex- 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
262°: pees pbtcatton REPORT, 1888-£9, cet 
perimental sciences. (IX, p. 239.) _ The discussions before the Camara 
dos Deputados (Chamber of Deputies) from year to year in regard to re- 
form of elementary education have brought out many facts appertaining 
to educational movements in other countries, and the result of these 
combined efforts has been to cause marked progress in educational mat 
ters in Brazil within the last twenty years. (VI, pp. 1056-1096.) | 
A tabulated statement of the amounts given for education in the prov- 
inces and by the state from 1874-75 on, will exemplify this to a certain 
extent, although the lack of school statisties from year to year militates 
against a clear exposition of the gradual increase in school facilities 
during that period.

Incomplete returns in, 1874-75 for 18 out of the 20 provinces gave 
5,562 elementary schools, with 169,895 pupils. Data for the succeeding 
years are not available, but in 1889-90 this number had increased to 
8,064 schools, with 266,100 pupils. That is, in 16 years an increase of 
~ 2,502 elementary schools and of 96,205 pupils is observable, and during 
the same period the total appropriations for public instruction increased 
$2,053,744, and the state appropriations $816,366. And yet it is stated 
that the result of such expenditure is not especially satisfactory. The 
    cause of this is, the lack of density of population in many of the prov- — 
inces; the non-enforcement of laws pertaining to school attendance; 
the indifference of parents in regard to the education of their children, 
and lastly, a lack of unity in school matters, a spirit of local pride dom- 
inating that national spirit which would bring about a centralization 
of educational interests, and with that a national system of education, 
(VI, pp. 579, 1015-1056.) ‘

CHAPTER XI 
THE INCEPTION AND THE PROGRESS OF THE AMERIOA 
NORMAL-SCHOOL CURRICULUM TO 1880, Se 
INTRODUCTORY, 
For the past three years the currieulam of the normal school has been a sub- 
ject that has received considerable attention at the annual, meeting of the National 
Teachers’ Association. The intricate and delicate matter of ascertaining the charac- 
ter of the present curriculum is still in their hands, It is the purpose of the following 
compilation to present the circumstances, so faras they area matter of record, under 
  which the early curricula were established during the fourth and fifth decades of the _ 
present century, the ideas of those who made them, and the modifications they 
underwent up to the date of 1880. 
The period we are about to speak of is the second or so-called empirical stage of 
Professor Payne’s classification, as will appear from the following statement taken 
from the announcement of his course at the University of Michigan in 1880: 
_ ‘There are three well-marked phases of thought with respect to fitness for teach- 
ing: Y 
‘1, The earliest conception, and the one that is the most prominent in the legal 
requirements for obtaining a license to teach is, that general scholarship constitutes 
fitness for teaching. 
“2. A progressive phase of thought, marked by the establishment of normal schools, 
asserts that general scholarship supplemented by a knowledge of specific methods, 
constitutes fitness for teaching. 
“3. The conception now gaining ground is that teaching should cease to be an 
empirical art Badisteta become a rational art; that the teacher should not only be 
instructed in processes but should also be taught the body of doctrine that underlies 
them and assures their validity. In other words, the art of teaching has outgrown 
its empirical stage, and is now growing into its rational or scientific stage. This” 
phase of thought is indicated by the general movement, especially in the Northwest, 
to make the science of education an established branch of university instruction. 
As this is one of the latest of the sciences, it has not yet been cast into articulate 
form. In fact, it is now in process of formation.” 
It will be observed that Professor Payne speaks of these as ‘‘ phases of thought,’’ 
not as actualities. For, indeed, much the larger portion of our teaching corps is 
made up of those who have obtained their positions by merely passing an examina- 
tion, and one may infer from the summary of President Gray at the meeting of the 
National Teachers’ Association, in 1887, that the expression ‘‘ normal-school curricu- 
lum” has more than one meaning. 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NORMAL AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SCHQOLS. 
It is not necessary to enter upon the discussion of the question what the science 
and art of education is made up of, or even whether the main object of a normal 
school should be to give instruction in that science and art. But, as the question is 
sometimes asked why normal schools do not teach the science and art of education,   
1Phis and the threo following chapters, relating to the general subject of training of teachers, have been prepared by Mr. Wellford Addis, specialist of the Rnreau.

  216%, ' EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
since law, medical, and theological schools teach the sciences of law, medicine, and 
theology, it may be well to point out a material difference between schools for train- 
ing persons for one of the learned professions and normal schools, since it may explain 
a very vigorous demand abont 1870 for better qualified candidates for admission on 
the part of several normal school principals. 
The difference consists in the relation that the subject-matter of instruction in a 
Jaw or medical school on one side and the instruction in a normal school on the other 
bear tothe subject-matter of instruction in an elementary school, There is no immedi- 
ate connection between canaienoung a sentence and a legal document; but there 
may be but an interval of a few days between learning a thing and teaching what 
has just been acquired to another, especially if that other be a child. To increase 
the preparatory course of study is to protract the day of graduation, and thus to in- 
sure that maturity which in other professions is required by law, and which goes for 
@ good deal.! 
In the effort to reorganize the Boston city normal school in 1873, the professional 
character of the school seems to have been “suggested ” by the mayor—who opposed 
the reorganization—and qualifiedly denied by the school committee on normal 
schools in the following terms: 2 
“The suggestion sometimes heard that this school has anything in common, in its 
legal basis, with a medical school or a law school, can hardly have been made upon 
reflection. A young man enters a law school for his own personal ends. He pur- 
“sues his studies, pays his bills, graduates, hires an office, puts out a sign, and waits 
for clients. His fees may be small or large ; no one fixes his income and limits it by 
rule. He is not educated for the public service; he does not enter the public serv- 
ice. No committee, acting for the public interest, discharges him from his position 
or transfers him from one field to another as the public good may demand.” 
_THE NEW PSYCHOLOGY AND OLD NECESSITIES. 
In the second paragraph of his Philosophy of Education, Rosenkranz speaks with 
virulence of the results flowing from the impossibility of exactly defining education. 
“Since education,” says he, “is capable of no such exact definitions of its principle 
and no such logical treatment as other sciences, the treatises written upon it abound 
in shallowness more than those of any other literature. Short-sightedness and arro- 
gance find in it a most congenial atmosphere, and uncritical methods and declama- 
tory bombast flourish as nowhere else.” ‘ 
We therefore hasten to inquireif, since education as a science is incapable of exact 
definition, the curriculum of the school where the science of education is taught can 
be definitely fixed. 
It is true that Monsieur Gréard assures us in his report on the schools of Paris that 
“pedagogy is nothing more than the application of psychology to education; ” add- 
ing significantly, ‘‘an application that, in elementary education, grows more delicate 
asthe nature operated upon is less cultivated.”? To much the same purport Professor 
Bain tells us that ‘ the largest chapter in the science of education must be the fol- 
lowing out of all the psychological laws that bear directly or indirectly upon the 
process of mental acqnirement;” while Mr. Sally thinks he ‘‘may perhaps assume 
that modern pedagogics has adopted the idea that education isconcerned, not simply 
with instruction or in communicating knowledge, but with the training of faculty.” 4 
Yet we take it the science of education, as written up by Professor Bain in his work 
Education as a Science, is not the same thing as the science of psychology, as written 
up by Mr. Sully in his Outlines of Psychology, with special reference to the theory of 
education. We would define Mr. Bain’s work, after Chapter 5, as the science of the 
curriculum of the elementary school, and Mr. Sully’s as the science of the phenomena 
of the human mind in general. 
But it is immaterial, as far as relates to the distinguished agitators for normal 
schools in the fourth decade of this century, whether psychology and education be 
the same or sister sciences, or stand in the relation of mother and child; for educa- 
tional psyehology is of modern growth, Nevertheless, the gentlemen who intro- 
’ duced the normal school, though ignorant of the psychology of the eighth and ninth 
decades, had a very definite idea of what they wanted, which in all probability was 
far better than to have had a mere knowledge of that psychology. 
It is one of the distinguishing merits of the German jurisconsult, Savigny, that he 
showed the legal institutions of a country to be a part of the life of the community 
and not a thing to be put on or off at a moment’s notice. h The adoption of the form 
  
{The principal of the St. Lonis Normal School said in 1870 that “it is almost impossible, hopeless, to demand from the average girl of sixteen the kind of mental work we must have.” See also pp. 446and__ 447 of the Burean’s Report for 1887-88.

  THE NORMAL SCHOOL CURRICULUM. | ; De 
of government that obtains in the United States has not saved other Republics of this 
continent either from revolutions or dictators. “ 
Let us pause for a moment so that we may bring before us the condition of education 
half a century ago. The name and character of Barnas Sears, State superintendent, 
college president, and the educational genius of the Peabody Fund, is well known, 
In one of those luminous articles that make the proceedings of the American Insti- 
tute’ of Instruction so interesting he speaks of the ‘‘éducational progress in the 
United States during the last fifty years,” saying: : 
“But it is time to approach the close of this second. period [1776-1830 | and-to 
speak of the schools as they were towards the year 1¥30, I will speak of them as I 
knew them, for I was in them about 10 years as a pupiland 6 winters as a teacher 
during the first quarter of the century. * “ * At the opening of the school (usu- 
ally numbe,ing from 80 to 100) in the morning, the first class, turning from their writ- 
ing desks, which were the highest in the room and nearest the walls, was called up 
to read in these words: ‘Arise, manners, take your seats,’ They then read in turn, pro- 
nouncing the words as monotonously as they would in a spelling lesson, in what was 
familiarly called the ‘school tone.’ This done by each niember, the class again go- 
ing throngh the ‘manners’ process, swing their feet over the bench, face the wall, 
and are ready for writing. In this exercise each pupil filled his page after the mas- 
ter’s copy. Then followed the hour for ciphering, which, like the writing, required 
rauch of the master’s attention. In difficult cases he would consult the manuscript 
book which lay in his desk andin which all the sums of the text-book were wrought 
out, copied from the book of some old schoolmaster. This process was repeated until 
the lowest class was reached and the work of the furenoon finished. 
“‘ Half the session being thus ended, the whole process was reversed. The young- 
est child was called up again ‘to say his letters,’ a term which fitly described the per- 
formance. Next followed an exercise which required genius. , ‘I'he task assigned was 
to make syllables by repeating in sundry ways the names of the first two letters of 
the alphabet, although there was no more connection between those names and the 
syllables than there was between them and the moon. It reminds me of the story of 
the monk who filed his teeth in order to speak Hebrew.” } 
Under such circumstances, circumstances requiring great will power, perhaps, but * 
little learning on the part of the teacher, those extraordinary changes in the teach- 
ing force of which mention is made on page 322 could occur with impunity. One of 
the great virtues of the teacher was not to be ‘‘run out” by the older boys. 
Now, the gentlemen who saw these evils also saw the remedy; and the normal 
school was inaugurated. The human race, says, in substance, Governor Boutwell at 
the opening of the Salem (Massachusetts) Normal School, may be divided into two 
classes so that the description of each shall be this: One has no ideal of a future dif- 
ferent from the present, at most no clearer conception of a higher existence. The 
other class is conscious of the power of progress, is making continual advances, and 
has an ideal, such as, in its judgment, the present ought to be. 
‘The agitators for normal schools were the radicals of those days. Those who cling 
to the methods they introduced are now looked upon in some quarters as very strong 
conservatives, for in the mean time not only a “new psychology,” but a “new educa- 
tion,” has arisen, Yet despite this advance in theory, as late as 1869 a committee 
of the American Normal School Association in reporting upon a course of study says 
“that the normal school is compelled by the necessities of its position in the system 
to adjust itself to the condition and circumstances of the subordinate parts of that 
system. It must let itself down so far as to be accessible by the average of those 
who have received their preparation in the lower schools. Otherwise its rooms would 
be tenantless and its occupation gone.” What must have been the situation in 1040! 
But we should rather inquire why was the situation changed in L+80? This will lead 
us into conjecture, it is true, but not unprofitable conjecture, since it may stimulate 
those who do know into putting their information under the public eye. 
It was not until after the War of the Rebellion that city normal schools began to 
flourish. The normal school of Philadelphia, it must be admitted, was established 
in 1848, yet we find the principal, in a late report, urging that the pupils ke given an 
academic course of instruction before being admitted into the normal school. The 
Boston Normal School was merely a girls’ high school until its reorganization in 1872, 
and soon. Now the idea of the principal of the Philadelphia Normal School in all 
' probability occurred to the authorities in every city system having a normal school 
and a high school. Without the city high achool the city normal school is but a high 
schcol. We know, at least, that many high schools have a normal class, usually the   
\In the first volume of his American Annals of Education the editor, William C. Woodbridge, pub- 
lished an account of a ‘‘common school from 1801 to 1831, purporting to be from ‘ateacher.’” The arti- 
cle closes with the following paragraph: “ Until within a few years no studies have been permitted in the day school but spelling, reading, 
and writing. Arithmetic was taught by a few instructors one or two evenings in a:week. but in 
spite of a most determined opposition, arithmetic is now permitted in the day school and a few pupils 
study geography.” :

  class of the fourth year. But could the isolated or State normal school, drawing its, 
pupils from the rural. districts, and these pupils appointed by political persons or 
otherwise, act as independently as the cities? We think not. What those schools 
can now attempt in the way of exacting high requirements for admission it is not 
our purpose to inquire. 3 i 
In all probability three conclusions will be reached by the critical reader of the 
following pages. It will appear that the utility of the early normal school was based 
on the theory that the acquisition of knowledge is only a preliminary step to the 
ability to impart it, and that the function of the normal school was to give the pupil 
an opportunity to digest what he had elsewhere learned. It will also appear that in 
practice the function of the early normal school was, in the beginning, to review and 
perfect the elements of a common school education and the elements of science includ- 
ing a great deal, perhaps too much, of higher mathematics, but that the curriculum 
eyentually widened out until it contained subjects which are not taught in the com- 
mon schools, though properly appearing in an institution for classical secondary edu- 
cation. And, finally, it will be very apparent that, whereas the theory of the normal 
school required it to train its pupils to impart knowledge to unlettered persons in 
the common schools, it was in the first terms of its course compelled to become a 
common school itself and to teach the future teacher not only what he would be 
called npon to teach, but also to train him to impart the knowledge that in the 
proper sense of the word he hardly knew himself. The theory of Mr. Dix and especi- 
ally of Mr. Mann, seems very sound, and those who encouraged the drift of the normal 
school curriculum towards a high school curriculum have brought upon their suc- 
cessors the condition of affairs that in Prussia led to the interference of the state and 
the Drei Preussischen Regulative of October, 1854. Their only excuse can be that 
the studies of the elementary school are by themselves insufficient to give the intel- 
lectual development that an elementary school teacher must have, and that to seeure 
~ not only this intellectual development but also maturity in years the State or isolated 
normal school was compelled to model its program after that of an academy. This 
explanation, however, is such a covert attack upon the program of the elementary 
school, ‘‘ where,” according to Mr, Mann, ‘the mass of children must look for all the 
aids of education they will ever enjoy,” and so favorable to that of the secondary 
school, that its justification must rest upon the result of those still very unsettled 
questions, what shall the common school teach? what the high school? 
pal THE NAME ‘NORMAL.” 
The name normal school came from France, The guiding light of the innovators 
was, at least in New York, M. Cousin’s once celebrated report or series of reports on 
public instruction in several states of Germany and particularly in Prussia, 
The full work in French seems to have been read by the New York board of regents 
in 1834, but the book was undoubtedly more widely readin a translation of the por- 
tion relating to Prussia,? of which one-half was given to the subject of ‘primary 
normal schools” (a literal but inexact translation of écoles normales primaires, which 
was the Gallic term for the expressive name of Schullehrer-Seminarien, by which 
these schools were then and are now known).? by 
Thus our “school teachers’ seminaries” became known as normal (literally model 
or preper) schools—a school with a French name and a Prussian curriculum, With 
this brief preface we now turn to the tirst effort, inaugurated at public expense, to 
provide our public schools with teachers. 
PUBLIC NORMAL CLASSES IN NEW YORK. 
As has been remarked above it is proposed to treat only of the curriculums of public 
schools for the training of teachers and the object for which they were founded by 
the several States or cities that possess them. Such an investigation must begin wit 
theact of the legislature of New York, in 1834, for the distribution (if the regents 
of the university of the State should deem it expedient) of the excess of the annual 
revenue of the library fund, or portions of it, over $12,000, among the several acade- 
mies subject to their jurisdiction. These sums were to be expended by the acade-

educated for teaching in the public schools.! t 
In presenting his report as chairman of the committee of the board of regents, to 
which body the proposition of the legislature had been referred, Mr. Dix said that 
he and his colleagues were deeply impressed with the feeling that the result of the 
deliberation of the board would ameliorate the ‘leading and acknowledged defect 
in our common school—the want of competent teachers; ” for ‘‘ the position is indis- 
putable that without able and well-trained teachers no system of instruction can be 
considered complete.” : : 
These sentiments have ever been maintained, and the question is ‘‘by what means.

are competent teachers to be provided?” We will, therefore, examine Mr. Dix’s re- _ 
port with this intent, premising that it isin a normal class or school that such work 
is to be performed. 
“Tn determining the course of study,” says the report, ‘the committee have thought 
it proper to designate as subjects to be taught all which they deem indispensable to 
be known by a first-rate teacher of a common school.” These subjects were—

After stating that no scholar should be permitted to follow the normal course: who 
had not passed the regent’s examination in the common-school studies, the committee. 
take up and discuss each of the above-named subjects seriatim, 
In regard to English language the report says: ‘‘ This-branch constitutes the most 
extensive and perhaps the most important field of instruction for a teacher. Unless 
a teacher is thoroughly master of his own language he can not be a competent 
instructor.” The language course of the Kinderhook Academy is commended, or, at 
least, instanced, as showing what such a course should be. This course was as fol- 
lows:

7. Reading. dictionaries. 
As to writing and drawing, the second subject for pupils of the normal school, it 
was boldly maintained that “ ev pupil must be able, before he leaves the institu-. 
tion, to write a good hand. * For beginners, slates may be used with great 
advantage, as suggested in Taylor’s District School. * * * Drawingis only to be 
taught so far as it may be necessary for'the purpose of mapping.” : 
In arithmetic Daboll’s work was to be thoroughly mastered and “ mental arithme- 
tic might be advantageously resorted to, and, indeed, be deemed indispensable as a 
discipline of the mind.” In geometry, trigonometry, mensuration, and suryeying, the 
work should be practical, and the committee knew of no book that would answer this 
purpose, those in use being 100 extensive." 
To teach geography to the pupils of the class, maps and globes must be obtained; 
for even with their aid the pupils would have difficulty in acquiring distinct concep- 
tions of geographical facts. 
“The laws which should govern all men, both with respect to the investigation of 
truth and to the discharge of the duties resulting from the relations which they bear 
    # 
to one another, and to the Author of their existence, should be familiar to every. 
teacher, particularly as his own moral character is subject to a periodical examina- 
tion by the inspectors.” ‘Abercrombie’s treatise and the moral philosophy part of 
Paley’s Moral and Political seg were recommended. 
This brings us to the discussion of the principlesof teaching, a subject that calls for 
a lesssummary mode of treatment than the foregoing heads have either required or have been given. The report reads: 
, “In this branch, instruction must be thorough and copious. It must not be con- 
fined simply to the art of teaching or the most successful methods of communicating knowledge, but must embrace also those rules of moral government which are as nec-   
1 It may be well to observe that eight academies were selected in each of which a normal class was to be formed. It was not until 1844 that a State normal school was established.

essary for the regulation of the conduct of the teacher as for the formation of the 
character of those who are committed to his care. ? i 
“Although this branch of instruction is mentioned last in the order of subjects, it 
should in fact run through the whole course. All the other branches should be so 
taught as to be subservient to the great object of creating a facility for communicat- 
ing instruction to others. In teaching the principles of the art, it would be desirable 
to make Hall’s Lectures on School-Keeping a text-book; and Abbott’s Teacher, © 
Taylor’s District School, and the Annals of Education should be used as reading 
books for the double purpose of improvement in reading the English Hengaage and 
for becoming familiar with the most improved modes of instruction and the best 
Tules of school government. * * * 4 
“The pupils in the departments should be practiced in all that can devolve on a 
teacher. It is of the first importance that they should be made, each in turn, to 
conduct some part of the recitations, to prepare proper questions on the particular 
subject of study, and to illustrate it by explanations for the purpose of improving 
their’ colloquial powers, and thus giving them a facility for explaining whatever 
they may be required to teach in the future office of instructor. The tutor should 
then go over the whole ground after them, pointing out their errors or defects, and 
giving them credit for whatever may appear to merit commendation, * * * 
“Tt has been customary in the examination of teachers, with a view to determine 
their qualifications, to ascertain only whether they possess a proper knowledge of the 
subject in whieh they are expected to give instruction. But although this is in gen- 
eral the only object of inquiry, it isin fact a very erroneous criterion of their ability 
to teach. The possession of knowledge does not necessarily carry with it the faculty 
of communicating knowledge to others.” 
Pausing to consider the purport of the several paragraphs of the last quotation, 
the first two would seem to declare that the object of the instruction of the normal 
school should be to instruct its pupils how to communicate knowledge and to mold 
the moral character of the children subsequently to be committed to their care, the 
third that the intending teacher should be practiced in schoolroom procedure, and 
the fourth that possession of knowledge is quite different from ability to impart it. 
But in what does this ability consist, and does the committee consider it a heaven- 
born gift or an acquirable one? As to the first the report continues: : 
“Tt is for this reason that the best methods of imparting instruction should be 
made a subject of instruction to those who are preparing themselves for the business 
of teaching. They should know how to command the attention of their pupils, to 
communicate the results ot their own researches and experience in the manner best 
calculated to make a lasting impression on the mind, to lead their pupils into the 
habit of examining for themselves. * * * At every step the mind should be 
taught to rely upon its own powers. The pupils should be required to assign reasons 
for every position assumed in their various studies.” ‘‘To almost every species of, 
instruction the inductive method may be applied to great advantage, for nature her- 
self teaches this.” . 
As to the qnestion of acquiring the ability of holding the attention, or of studying 
it as a psychological phenomenon, the report does not speak, perhaps deeming that 
the necessary information would be picked up by the intending teacher in an 
empirical way from self-inspection when under instruction, or while in a model 
school instructing others. Of the organization of the school the report relates: 
‘In determining the proper organization of the departments, the committee have 
fully considered the question whether the studies and recitations should be distinct 
from the ordinary academic exercises [in the school of which each teacher’s training 
class formed a department]; and although they are disposed to leave this in some 
degree to the discretion of the academies, yet they are decidedly of the opinion that 
convenience coincides with good policy in requiring that pupils who are in a course 
of training for teachers should be taught in connection with the other students. So 
far as mental discipline is concerned, both classes of pupils require the same mode of 
training, and to a certain extent the same studies will be pursued. Whenever the 
peculiar duties of teachers are the subject of study and examination, separate reci- 
tations will become necessary.” 
The course recommended was of three years, and the boards of control of the acad- 
emies were strongly urged to grant diplomas with the utmost caution, since ‘‘asingle 
individual educated in one of the proposed departments and going forth to teach with 
a diploma, but without the requisite moral and intellectual qualifications, would do 
much to bring the whole system into disrepute.” The eight academies selected for 
this initiative were Erasmus Hall, Montgomery, Kinderhook, Middlebury, St. Law- 
. rence, Fairfield, Oxford, and Canandaigua. ‘ 
It should be mentioned, however, before leaving the discussion of this beginning 
of training teachers at public expense that in 1827 an act was passed in compliance 
with the repeated recommendations of several of the governors of the State, adding 
$150,000 to the capital of the literary fund for the express purpose of promoting the

education of teachers, But the only academies that had devoted the amounts received 
to the establishment of teachers’ training classes were the last three mentioned 
above. Of the success attained by the St. Lawrence Academy class the committee 
speak in high terms. Almost all the public-school teachers of the vicinity had been 
educated within its walls and the average salary of the teacher had risen from thirty to 
forty dollars above the average that obtained before the school had been established. 
CURRICULUM OF THE FIRST PUBLIC NORMAL SCHOOL. X 
On the 12th of March, 1838, the secretary of the Massachusetts board of education 
notified the legislature of the State that “‘ private munificence has placed condition- 
ally at my [his] disposal the sum of $10,000 * “* * to be disbursed under the direc- 
tion of the board of education, in qualifying teachers of our public schools.” The 
condition was that the State should contribute an equal amount. The agitation of 
the question had been commenced eleven years before. ( 
The question before the board, when the State had accepted Mr. Dwight’s “ muni- 
ficence,” was,“ Should the board concentrate its efforts and expend its funds upon a 
single school? Should it attempt to engraft a department for the qualification of 
teachers, upon academies in different parts of the State? Shouli it attempt to ob- 
tain the codperation of public-spirited individuals and establish private institutions 
in the center of convenient sections of the Commonwealth?” ‘If existing academies 
were selected,” says Mr. Mann, “and anew department engrafted upon them this 
department would be but a secondary interest in the school; the teachers would not 
be selected so much with reference to the incidental, as to the principal object, and as 
the course of instruction, proper to qualify teachers, must be essentially different 
from a common academical course [compare the opinion of the New York committee 
above] it would be impossible for any preceptor duly to superintend both.” In an- 
other connection he remarks on this subject: ‘‘The course of studies commonly pur- 
sued at the institutions which are worthy to be called academies consists rather in an 
extension of knowledge into the higher departments of science than in reviewing and 
thoroughly and critically mastering the rudiments or elementary branches of know]- 
edge. Yet the latter is the first business of the normal pupil. * * * Few intel- 
lectual operations are more dissimilar than those of acquiring and imparting. The 
art of imparting is the main portion of the normal pupil’s qualification; while acqui- 
sition, as our academies are generally conducted, is the main object of the academ- 
ical student.”+ 
The deliberations and the smallness of the appropriation resulted in the establish- 
ment of three schools in different parts of the State and that municipal ‘‘ muniticence” 
was invoked, and invoked not in vain. To the honor of the Commonwealth seven towns 
[townships] responded, and many made generous offers with a view to partaking in 
the benefits. Two schools were immediately provided, that at Lexington and that at 
Barre, and a third about the same time at Plymouth. 
Mr. Mann, speaking of the term “normal school,” says that France, having copied 
to some extent the Prussian system, has ‘‘ borrowed the name” from that country, 
‘where schools for the qualification of teachers have long been in successful opera- 
tion,” and where “they are universally known by the epithet normal.” ‘A normal 
school.” he continues, ‘signifies a school where the rules of practice and the principles 
of guidance and direction in the various departments of education are taught. The name 
is short, descriptive from its etymulogy, and in no danger of being misunderstood or 
misapplied.” i ; 
The curriculum of the schools thus established is given by Mr. Mann, secretary 
of the board of education, as follows: - 
. Music. 1, Orthography, Reading, Grammar, Composi- 
Constitution and History of Massachusetts tion and Rhetoric, 
2, Writing, Drawing. 3. Arithmetic, Mental and Written, Algebra, 1 gic. 8.

1“ This costly mistake of New York,” says the State superintendent of Connecticut, Mr. Northrop, 
in his Fourth Annual Report as secretary of the board of education of that State, ‘did not prevent its repetition in Kentucky and Maine,” and after a few lines, ‘The early failure of the experiment 
both in Maine and Kentucky was no matter of surprise to the intelligent friends of education. When 
a normal department is a mere suffix to another institution, it must obviously lack that unity and com- 
pleteness of plan and those professional methods of training which are essential to a true normal 
school. * * * There remain in certain States a few feeble academies, whose tumid circulars assume 
the ‘‘normal” prefix, while they resemble the thing only in name, and stint in performance as much 
as they excel in promise.”

282 | EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. — Ante 
To enter, candidates—females only at the Lexington school, both sexes at Barre— 
must have attained the age of 17 if males, 16 if females, and have passed an examina- 
tion in orthography, reading, writing, grammar, geography, and arithmetic. The 
minimum term of study was fixed at one year. Mr. Mann does not give the reasons 
for the adoption of each of the studies of the curriculum, but says in general— 
“The most material point, in regard to the normal schools, relates to the course of 
instruction to be therein pursued. The elements for a decision of this question are 
found in the existing wants of our community. We want improved teachers for the 
common schools, where the mass of the children must look for all the aids of education 
they willeverenjoy * * * Inestablishing the regulations for the normal schools, 
and the course of studies to be pursued therein, the idea has not for a moment been 
lost sight of by the board [of education], that they are designed to improve the edu- 
cation of the great body of the people.” 
Pausing to comment on the normal-school course as above outlined, itis a matter 
of some surprise to find the subject of bookkeeping introduced here as in the New 
York course. If it be maintained that it was a practical feature inasmuch as it was 
one of the qualifications that make a clerk (we hear a great deal nowadays of the 
propensity a public-school course gives to engage in clerical work), how is navigation 
‘or surveying to be justified, especially when it is considered that it was the great 
body of the children that the normal-school graduates were to teach ? $ 
Touching the sex of the pupils, Mr. Mann maintains the superiority of the female 
teacher over the male in teaching young children, and he thinks the system of New 
York, in which but one academy had a class for Sonate female teachers, to be so 
far faulty, and claims that the Massachusetts board of education had acted wisely 
“in appropriating their first normal school exclusively to the qualification of female 
teachers,” a proof of its belief in ‘the relative efficiency of the female sex in the 
ministry of civilization and the value of female services in the education of the 
oung.” 
4 In fhe following year, 1840, a majority of the committee on education which had 
been directed by the Massachusetts house of representatives ‘‘to consider the expedi- 
ency of abolishing the board of education and the normal schools,” reported among 
others the following conclusions: 
“Another project imitated from France and Prussia, and set on foot under the 
superintendence of the board of education, is the establishment of normal schools. 
* * * Comparing the two normal schools already established with the academies 
and high schools of the Commonwealth, they do not appear to your committee to 
present any peculiar or distinguishing advantages. * * * It is insisted by the 
board, however, that the act of teaching is a peculiar art, which is particularly and 
exclusively taught at normal schools; but it appears to your committee that every 
person who has himself undergone a process of instruction must acquire, by that 
very process, the art of instructing others. This certainly will be the case with 
every person of intelligence; if intelligence be wanting no system of instruction can 
supply its place. An intelligent mechanic, who has learned his trade, is competent, 
by that very fact, to instruct others.in it; and needs no normal school to teach him 
the art of teaching his apprentices. * * * 
“‘Even if these schools did furnish any peculiar and distinguishing advantages, 
-we have no adequate security that the teachers, thus taught at the public expense, 
will remain in the Commonwealth; and it seems hardly just that Massachusetts, in 
the present state of her finances, should be called upon to educate, at her own cost, 
teachers for the rest of the Union. ; ; ' 
“Tf it be true that the teachers of any of our district schools are insufficiently 
qualified for the task, the difficulty originates, as it appears to your committee, not 
_in any deficiency of the means of obtaining qualifications, but in irisufficiency of 
compensation * * * and the want of means or inclination to pay an adequate 
salary is not a want which normal schools have any tendency to supply.” [Compare 
this last assertion, however, with that made by the committee of the New York 
Board of Regents respecting the influence exerted by the St. Lawrence senna 
We can not give the argument of the majority as to the grave political evils that 
would arise were the process of centralization inaugurated by the creation of a board 
of education, public libraries, and the normal alec persisted in; space and our 
object forbid it. Nor the reply of the minority farther than to say that they treated 
the “imaginary evils” of the majority with quite as much penetration as their 
opponents had displayed in fastening on the weak points of the normal schools. In 
1846 the course of the Lexington school then at West Newton was given by the cir- 
eular and register for the period 1839-1846, the earliest annual document of the school 
that this Office has in its files, as follows:

ments were occasionally given out. 
A model school was gonnected with the school and used as a preparatory school to 
the normal school classes. In this model or preparatory school the pupils of the 
rae class of the normal school taught in rotation, under the supervision of the prin- 
cipal, fl see 
Speaking of this school the Rev. S. J. May, the successor and biographer of Mr, 
Pierce, the first principal, says: 
* As soon as practicable after opening the normal school at Lexington, Mr. Pierce 
instituted the model department, a school composed of the children of the neighbor- 
hood, just such as would be found in most of our country district schools. In that 
he lead his pupils, by turns to apply and test for themselves the correctness and 
the excellence of the principles of teaching which he was laboring to instill into 
them. ‘This was the most peculiar part of the institution. In the management of it 
he evinced great adroitness, as well as indomitable perseverence and untiring pa- 
tience, In that model department the future teachers under his supervision prac- 
ticed the best methods of governing and instructing children, so that each one when 
she left the normal school carried with her some experience in the conduct of a com- 
mon school.” : 
In 1841, Mr. Pierce describes his method of training in the normal school or de- 
partment, properly so called, thus: ‘You [meaning the Hon. Henry Barnard, then 
superintendent of common schools of Connecticut and subsequently the first United 
States Commissioner of Education] ask for a full account of my manner of instruction 
in the art of teaching. This is not easy to give. From what Isay you may get some 
idea of what I attempt and of the manner of it.!| Two things 1. have aimed at espe- 
cially in this school: (1) To teach thoroughly the principles of the several branches 
studied, so that the pupils may have a clear and full understanding of them; (2) to . 
teach the pupils by my own example, as well as by precepis, the best way of teaching 
the same things effectually to others. Ihave four different methods of recitation: 
First, by question and answer; second, by conversation; third, by calling on one, 
two, three, more or fewer, to give an analysis of the whole subject contained in the 
lesson ; and fourth, by requiring written analyses, in which the ideas of the author 
are stated in the language of the pupil. * * * At all therecitations we have more 
or less of discussion, * * * Sometimes, instead of reciting the lesson directly to 
me, I ask them to imagine themselves for the time acting in the capacity of teachers. 
* * *~ At many of our recitations more than half the time is spent with reference. 
to teaching ‘ the art of teaching.’”   
1It may possibly be overcautious to say that by this was not meant Pitman’s or any other system 
of stenography. i 
1 Mr. Pierce was not only the head teacher but, the only one for the forty-one pupils in attendance in 
1841; the school opened with three. (May’s Memoir and Boston Com,’ Sch. Journal, 1841.)

The sessions of this school, of which there were two for each of the 5 school days 
of the week, continued from three to three and one-half hours. Out of school the 
= pupils were expected to devote two or three hours of each day to study. 
In the sixth annual report (1843) of the Massachusetts State Board of Education 
the following occurs: ‘‘The board would be far from intimating that all the pupils 
of the normal schools have given satisfaction to the districts in which they have been 
» employed. This would be a consummation rather devoutly to be wished than reason- 
ably to be expected. For the purpose of disseminating as far as possible the advan- 
‘ _ tages arising from these schools amongst all the people of the State, it has been the 
! object of the board rather to make a partial improvement in the minds of many pupils 
than to perfect a few in the business of instruction.” , 
NORMAL SCHOOL OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. 
The normal classes of the academies of New York seem not to have been altogether 
Rie satisfactory, and by act of May 7, 1844, the legislature provided fora State normal 
. school at Albany, in conformity with a lengthy report reviewing the establishment 
of schools on this and on the other side of the Atlantic, and, especially, the working of 
the schools in Massachusetts. The school was placed under the control of an “ exec- 
utive committee,” one of whom was the superintendent of public instruction, who 
said in his remarks on the opening of the school, December 18, 1844: 
“Tt is not expected that individuals will be received as members of this institution 
who are not already acquainted with those departments of education which are usu- 
ally taught in our schools. Their knowledge of all the elementary branches is here 
to be reviewed and made perfect; and in addition to this they will be carefully and 
practically exercised in the best modes of teaching all these branches. For this pur- 
pose arrangements are now in progress, although not yet completed, for providing 
model classes of little children of the different ages and descriptions usually found in 
our country schools. These classes will be taught by the pupils of this institution, 
under the supervision of the principal, from the learning of the alphabet upwards 
through all the grades of common-school education. * ti 
‘In addition to the ordinary branches of study pursued in our common schools, it is 
intended that vocal music and drawing shall form a part of the course of instruction 
here to be communicated. Physiology also, so far as it embraces the science of vi- 
tality and the laws to be observed in the preservation of health, will be taught.” 
The executive committee, in addition to the studies indicated above, added algebra, 
geometry, surveying, application of science to the arts, use of globes, intellectual 
and moral philosophy, ‘and such other branches as the executive committee may 
from time to time direct.” Coeducation was practiced. In the earliest catalogue 
this Office has of this school (1845), the programme is given as follows:

The experimental school was under the charge of “a permanent teacher,” who 
was aided by *‘two ‘teachers’ and two ‘visitors’ each week; it being understood that 
the ‘visitors’ of the one week shall become the ‘ teachers’ for the next.” 
THE NORMAL SCHOOL OF PHILADELPHIA, 
We have spoken of the necessity when considering the question we have in hand, 
of beginning with the action taken in New York, but by the fifth section of the act 
of the 6th of March, 1818, for the education of children at public expense within th 
city and county of Philadelphia,” the controllers of the public schools were ‘to 
tablish a model school to qualify teachers for sectional schoo!s in other parts of Penn- 
sylvania.” The building and furnishing of this ‘‘ model school ” cost $4,938, the teach- 
ers’ salaries, stationery, etc., $2,157, and furniture $862, as reported on the 31st of De- 
cember, 1¢19; this was the first schoolhouse erected by the city school authorities. 
The city had adopted tte Lancasterian or monitorial system, in which “one teacher, 
aided by monitors from amongst his own pupils, was considered sufficient for the care 
and government and instruction of 300 children.” 
In the eleventh annual report of the controllers (1829) we find that ‘several per- 
sons of both sexes have recently availed themselves of the privilege of acquiring a 
knowledge of the Lancasterian plan of instruction by attending the model and other 
schools, and some of the individuals thus qualified are candidates for employment in 
Pennsylvania ;” and that ‘‘the principal of the boys’ model school has compiled an 
epitome of geography especially adapted to seminaries of mutual instruction.” , In 
1834, sixteenth annual report, an ‘‘ experimental infant school was established in the 
building occupied by the model school, exhibiting ‘ under the directions of its accom- 
plished teacher, a constant and rapid improvement in the children, and at the same 
time has furnished an admirable seminary for the instruction of infant-school teachers, 
numbers of whom have regularly devoted their time to the acquirement of practical 
skill in conducting these schools, and are believed in several instances now compe- 
tent to take charge of similar establishments.” 
About 1836 a system of ‘infant schools” and another of ‘‘ primary schools” hav- 
ing grown up by the side of the ‘‘monitorial schools,” and a committee having 
visited Boston and New York, the monitorial system began rapidly to decline, and an 
effort, “‘an experiment” as the president of the board calls it, was made to supply 
the place of ‘juvenile monitors, often incompetent and always indifferent to the 
improvement of their fellows” by well-qualified teachers, of whom a number should 
be of the gentler sex, that the “‘ peculiar benefits to be derived from their presence — 
and influence” might be secured. The high school establisbed in the following 
year was for boys only; many of its graduates, however, became teachers. 
In the twenty-fourth annual report (1842) ‘a plan for organizing a branch of the 
high school for females and a school for female teachers, in the model school had 
been discussed during the year, but nothing definite had been determined on in rela- 
tion to them.” One of the three courses of the high school was the ‘classical 
' course for teachers and others.” In 1844 “ Saturday classes, to consist of girls and 
female teachers, connected with the public schools, were formed. The following is

This course was to correct ‘the singular anomaly of intelligent and well-educated 
young women, from the date of their appointment as primary teachers, actually 
, retrograding, and becoming finally disqualified for promotion by the time their age 
a and experience entitled them to it.” On February 1, 1848, the city normal school y 
was established, with seven departments, under as many instructors, including the 
2 principal, who had charge of the professional training. The names of the depart- 
WAG ments and their scope are thus given in the first semi-annual report ot the principal, 
dated August 29, 1848. : 2 
I. Theory.and Practice of Teaching.—Lectures on the principles of education, embracing mental, 
moral, and physical education, and instruction in teaching the elementary branches, 
IL Department of Mathematics.—Review of elementary arithmetic, and instruction in higher 
arithmetic, algebra, and elementary astronomy. 
III. Department of History.—Review of geography and history of the United States, and instruc- 
i tion in the history of America, with the contemporaneous history of England. ’ IV. Department of Grammar.—Review of English grammar, and instruction in the elements of 
composition and rhetoric. i 
V. Department of Reading.—Instruction in the art of reading, course of reading and analysis of 
English words, 
VI. Department of Drawing and Writing. ; 
VIL Department of Music. i 
Practice in teaching and lectures on school government were to be added, and a 
course in chemistry, physics, and physiology. The session lasted five hours and foar 
recitations were had daily. ‘ ' . 
The theory of the instruction is thus given by the principal: 
“The style of recitation, mode of illustration, and perspicuity and precision of 
language, have been made prominent objects of instruction; and while care Was 
taken to familiarize the pupils with the branches reviewed, a thorough acquaint- 
ance with the best means of rendering them intelligible, especially to dull minds or 
weak capacities, wasinsisted on. ‘The members of the classes were themselves made 
the subjects of practical illustration of the methods to be pursued, by requiring all 
who were found ignorant of the elements to return to first principles and master 
them before being allowed to enter upon a study requiring a knowledge of these 
principles; nor were any permitted to pass to a higher subject of study until their 
» perfect acquaintance with the lower branches was demonstrated by their exhibiting 
ability to communicate what they knew to the fellow members of their classes.” 
‘The principal would maintain that ‘‘the real difference, between a normal school 
and an ordinary school consists in learning to impart, as well as learning.” He says: 
“The difference between acquiring a knowledge of a branch for the purpose of teach- 
ing it, and studying merely for personal improvement, must be apparent to the most 
superficial observer; and if in a school a course of instruction is pursued adapted to 
qualifying teachers, then the school is no longer an ordinary one, but becomes a nor- 
mal school, and a twofold duty is imposed upon the pupils; first to acquire a knowl- 
edge of the branches, and then to learn to communicate that knowledge to others. 
The performance of the latter evidently involving loss. of time and waste of effort to 
all except those who are preparing themselves for teachers.” 
The school of practice was composed of a girls’ grammar schoo), with 230 pupils 
undera female principal and an assistant, and a boys’ secondary school, with 147 pupils, 
under a female principal and an assistant. Atleast three pupils of the normal school 
were employed at one time in teaching in one of these schools. It was the duty of 
c the regular teachers to aid the novice by teaching with herand for her. Before plac- 
€ \ © ing a pupil in charge of a class the principal carefully informed her as to the particular 
duties connected with its instruction and management. Should the pupil prove de- 
ficient, she was withdrawn, and her subsequent instruction in the normal school 
properly directed t» removing her deficiencies. 
THE CONNECTICUT NORMAL SCHOOL. 
In 1849 the legislature of Connecticut passed an act of which the first section reads: 
“There shall be established, as hereinafter provided, one normal school or seminary 
for the training of teachers in the art of instructing and governing the common 
schools of the Stato; the object of which normal schoo] or seminary shall be, not 
to educate teachers in the studies now regarded by law, but to receive such as are 
: found competent in these studies in the manner hereinafier provided, and train 
them in the best methods of teaching and conducting common schools.”

“THE NORMAL SCHOOL CURRICULUM.

The course of study at the beginning of the second year is given by the Connec- 
ticut School Journal (the earliest cireular in our files is for 1855) as follows: 
Junior Crass.—Every term.—Reading, writ- | 
ing, spelling, English grammar, arithmetic, geog- 
raphy, United States history, composition for 
rivate inspection, and declamation in private,

arrangements.

globes Pf lectures on the art of teaching; third | every term, 
session, lectures on natural philosophy and botany. 
Returning again to the fifth annual reportof the State superintendent, from which 
we have quoted the section of the organic law, we find among other matter pertain- 
ing to the new school the following: ‘‘ By means of the regular classes in the normal 
anfical and in the schools of practice an opportunity will be offered to every member 
of the school to review thoroughly any one or all of the elementary studies required 
to be tanght in the common schools of the State, and to extend his attainments in 
any of these studies, and such kindred branches as will facilitate his success as a 
teacher in any grade of common schools.” * * * In addition to the studies now 
generally taught in our schools, it is proposed to give some practical instruction in 
vocal music and physiology ; and to those whose previous training or whose residence 
at the institution will be long enough to allow of this extension of the course with- 
out abridging the time and the attention which are due to the elementary studies, a 
general view of the principles of agricultural chemistry and of domestic economy will 
be presented. ; ; 
The manner in which these subjects were to be taught was told in the following 
language: ‘Subjects will be taught in the normal school rather. than text-books ; 
and the manner in which the same subject is treated by several of the best authors 
will be compared and discussed, in order that the graduates may be prepared to de- 
cide on the comparative merits of school books, * * + * and atthe same time be 
able to teach the subjects properly, even if pupils of the same class should study the 
subject in different books. * * * In addition to familiar and practical suggestions 
on particular points in the organization, instruction, and discipline of schools, as occa- 
sion may call for the same in the daily routine of the instruction, lectures will be 
given on the history of education and schools; on the objects and principles of 
publie education in general, and of our own system in particular; on the art of 
teaching and its methods, and the application of these methods to each particular 
study ; on the theory of discipline and its practice; on the peculiarities of a district 
school, as well as of other grades of schools; on the principles of school architecture ; 
on légal position and relations of a teacher in our system of commen schools, and a 
_ Variety of other topics.” : 
MICHIGAN STATE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
Michigan has always been an educating State, and from the normal schools estab- 
lished in New England and in the Middle States we turn to tho region of the Great 
Lakes. 
We learn from the first section of the act of 1849 establishing the schoo], “Thata 
State normal school be established, the exclusive purposes of which shall be the in- 
struction of persons, both male and female, in the art of teaching and in all the 
various branches that pertain to a good common school education; also, to give in- 
structions in the mechanic arts, and in the arts of husbandry and agricultural chem- 
istry, in the fundamental laws of the United States, and in what regards the rights 
and vuties of citizens.” By section 10 it is further provided, ‘‘ That any person may 
be aumitted who shall pass a satisfactory examination.” 
The State board of education, in the report for 1880, comments on the foregoing pro- 
visions thus: i : 
“Tt will be seen that the above statement of the work of the normal school really 
includes all the work originally planned for the branches of the university. At the 
time the normal school was projected the branches of the university had been per- 
manently discontinued, and the high schools of the State not definitely planned. 
* * * There was, in fact, nothing in the way of public-school facilities between 
the district school and the university. * * * The normal school, therefore, as the 
only State school of the same grade, was to be a teachers’ school, a farmers’ school, 
an academy, allin one. In reality the academy had but little more right to a place

    normal school than had the farmers’ department. But for the time academic 
instrnetion had to be furrished there, because it was to be had nowhere else. 
In 1857-58, the date of the earliest catalogue our files possess, the course of study 
} : t is given as follows: 
Cass B.—Arithmetic, mentaland written; geog- | 
raphy, local and descriptive; grammar, synthet- ical spelling; readin; penmanship. Crass ‘C.—Arithmetic, algebra begun; book-

plied to education; trigonometry and surveying; chemistry. NorE.—Latin and German optional through- 
out the course. ‘The studies of each class occupy at least one entire term. 5 prac- 
ocution; analysis of the alphabet; art of teaching. | | 
«As soon as the student has made sufficient progress,” continues the circular for 
1858-59, “he is placed under a course of instruction designed to prepare him for his 
fature duties asa teacher.” This course, the only one which need detain us, em- 
braced— { ‘ 
1. Specific instruction to all classes in the normal school, in the methods of teach- 
ing the various studies usually pursued in our schools. ft 
2. Oral instruction on schoolroom duties, given to the B and C classes. 
ee A course of familiar lectures on the science and art of teaching, given to the D 
class, i 
4, Practice in teaching in the model school, by the E class. 
5. Instruction in the philosophy of education, given to the senior class. 
CITY NORMAL SCHOOLS ESTABLISHED IN THE SIXTH DECADE 
The normal school established in the city of Boston in 1852 was also fora thorough 
review of the studies taught in the grammar schools, and ‘instruction in the theory 
vand practice of teaching and in the art of government.” The city normal school of 
§ t. Louis was established in obedience to the ‘‘ idea” which was then ‘' rapidly becom- 
ing recognized all over our country where there are free schools, that teachers must 
receive a professional training before they are properly fitted for their work.” The 
doctrine that ‘any person who had only a partial! knowledge of arithmetic, gram- 
mar, and geography, and could read any composition in the English language with- 
out stopping to spell the hard words, was capable of teaching a school,” had become 
antiquated, and it was necessary to provide a course of “ professional training as will 
be to them what the study of law, or medicine, or theology is to their respective pro- 
fessors.” In Charleston, 8. C., a normal school was provided for in 1858 to aid “in 
carrying out a permanent and efficient plan of education,” which the board of edu- 
cation found difficulty in inaugurating on 
teachers. account of a want of suitably qualified

In addition to the above “ Orthosomic exercises, or practical exercises for the de- 
velopment of the physical frame,” were engaged in during the whole course ‘‘under 
the direction of a gentleman who devotes his whole time to the subject.” Graduates

PENNSYLVANIA SYSTEM. 
By the act of May 20, 1857, it was provided by the legislature of Pennsylvania 
“that when any number of citizens of this State, not less than 13, shall, as contribu- 
tors or stockholders, erect and establish a school for the professional training of young 
men and women as teachers for the common schools of the State,” such school 
might become a State normal school under certain conditions, of which one was that 
“each school shall have at least six professors of liberal education and known ability 
their respective departments, namely: One of orthography, reading, and elocu- 
on; one of writing, drawing, and bookkeeping; one of arithmetic and the higher 
branches of mathematics; one of geography and history; one of grammar and    
  Haglish literature, and one of theory and practice of teaching; together with such 
tutors and assistants therein, and such professors of natural, mental, and moral 
science, languages and literature, as the condition of the school and the number of 
students may require.” The first school working under this act appears to have been 
the school at Millersville, and in its circular for 1859-60 we find the following among 
everal other courses of study (‘‘ Students with a fair knowledge of the branches of 
study required by law, to be taught in the common schools” could enter and grad- 
uate from this course in three years. Those who did not need a review of the ele- 
mentary branches could enter upon the studies of the second year”): .

“The methods of teaching practiced in the school,” says the circular, ‘are * * * 
first, a thorough knowledge of the branches of study they propose to teach ; second, the 
best methods of teaching those branches; third, ability to instruct—to lead the 
young mind judiciously from the known to the unknown. * * * Academies and 
colleges profess to discipline mind and impart a knowledge of the various branches 
of study, and in this respect their object and that of a normal school are similar; 
bat the peculiar object of the latter class of educational institutions is to train persons

THE NORMAL UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS. 
The legislature of Illinois in 1858 provided for a normal university “‘ whose objects

tion in the art of teaching; in the branches of study which pertain to a common

States and of the State of Illinois in regard to the rights and duties of citizens; and 
such other studies as the board of education may from time to time prescribe.” ; 
The course of study of three years is thus outlined in the a ort of the first princi- 
pal to the trustees: First, the thorough mastery of the elementary or common school 
branches, including teaching and drill exercises ; second, of lectures on education 
and educational systems, of the theory and practice of teaching, school discipline, 
the school laws of Illinois, and physical education ; third, of a course in the higher 
English and mathematical studies and in the natural sciences, with lectures; fourth, 
of so much of the Latin and German languages as shall be necessary to the full under- 
standing of our own. it

In his first report to the board Principal Hovey remarks: “The organization of an : 
institution such as you have expected to be established, varying from any this side 
of the Alleghanies, and in some respects from any beyond, was a work of sufficient 
difficulty under favoring auspices. Some sup osed it to be an aristocratic establish- 
ment got up to educate the children of the wealthy or the influential; others 
proclaimed it ‘an experiment ; while a few circulated the absurd rumor that its 
object was the aggrandizement of individuals. * * * Andwhatare your designs? * 
Clearly to establish such aninstitution as the legislature had provided for, * 7 
The legislature meant to create such an institution as should be fit to stand at the — 
head of the great common school interest of Illinois; and as the first step it meant 
to relieve the State of the necessity of going peyond her own borders for carefully 
trained teachers for her public schools of every grade. It meant to furnish a means- 
of keeping alive professional enthusiasm, of suggesting more excellent methods of in- 
struction, and of improving the course of study in the free schools. * * * Unfor- 
tunately, for the past year a large amount of drill teaching has been required, which 
ought to have been done elsewhere, and it is quite probable that this state of things 
may continue for a series of years. ‘We can hardly expect to be released from the 
actual work of teaching the common branches until by the reflex influence of the uni- 
versity and other agencies now at work, the standard of elementary knowledge shall 
pe raised in the source whence come our students.” } 
MARYLAND NORMAL SCHOOL. 
3 
By the act of 1865, providing a ‘uniform system of free public schools for the 
State of Maryland,” a State normal school was established “ for the instruction and 
practice of teachers of public schools in the science of education and the art of teach- 
ing and the mode of governing schools.” The course of instruction was classed 
though not separated into two de) artments, academic and professional. “Although 
the main object of the normal school is ‘not to educate teachers in studies now re- 
quired by law, but to receive such as are found competent in these studies, and to 
train them in the best methods of teaching and conducting public schools,’ ” says 
Principal Newell in bis first report, “yet it has been considered necessary under present 
circumstances to devote a considerable portion of time to academic instruction. In 
the preparatory and the junior class rapid review is made of elementary studies. 
* * © The academic studies of the senior class for the present year will be algebra, 
geometry, rhetoric, English literature, and the natural sciences. In all the classes 
special attention is given to drawing, vocal music, and calisthenics, with a view of 
enabling teachers to introduce these subjects into primary and grammar schools.” 
‘As to the professional department of the course, Mr. Newell says: ‘‘ While the out- 
line of the course of instruction corresponds at least in part ith that of our besthigh 
schools, the purpose and aim of the high and the normal scHO6l are essentially differ- 
ent. In the high school the aim of the teacher is to communicate knowledge ; in the 
normal school it is to cultivate the power of communicating knowledge.” * * * 
A sound elementary education is a good preparation for the normal school; a thor- 
ongh high school course is still better ; and it is hoped that before long a high school 
Sipe or its equivalent will be necessary to secure admission to the State normal 
school. oh) 3 eo 
‘The subjects embraced in the more strictly professional part of the course are the 
history of public schools and popular education; the philosophy of mind, so far as 
it furnishes the foundation of educational theories; education as a positive science 5 
teaching as an art, methods of instruction, classification, government, and discipline; 
_ the school law of Maryland in its relation to citizens, teachers, and school officers ; the 
~ duties and qualifications of public school teachers.” — i 
From the report of the principal, published in the State report for 1867-68, the 
programme of the normal school is thus given: i r

i THE RHODE ISLAND NORMAL SCHOOL. 
i j f I 
The school established at Providence, R. I., in 1871, though not the first of its class 
in that State, is the one to be considered here. f 
In the first report of the principal of the school, established in 1871, occurs the fol- 
lowing: ‘The course of instruction in a normal s

course should do more than give skill in the teaching of arithmetic, geography, and _ 
grammar; it should secure intellectual culture If the time allotted to a normal 
course is too short to secure a high degree of professional skill or much intellectual” 
culture it should at least awaken professional enthusiasm and develop an abiding 
desire for intellectual culture. That enthusiasm will perfect skill, and that desire 
will insure persistent intellectual growth. But culture of intellect and skill in class 
work is not all that is needed. Every teacher should be a center of moral power. 
* * * A course of instruction should lead to a conscientious self-consecration to 
the werk of teaching, than which, viewed in its moral relations, there is no work 
nobler, more sacred, or more worthy of unreserved devotion.” 
The course was of 2 years, each apparently of two terms. Graduates of high 
schools could finish the course ina i The curriculum was as follows:

THE NEW HAVEN PLAN. 
In 1865 or 1866 the superintendent of the New Haven, Conn., school, Mr. Parish, 
inaugurated what was, as far as we know, a new departure. He left out the aca- 
demic and retained the professional features of the normal school. ‘This he was at first 
disposed to call and make in fact a ‘‘school of observation.” for individuals chosen 
from the list of applicants: for positions because of presumed qualifications for their 
future vocation, The instruction in the school called in 1867 a ‘ training school” 
was somewhat modified in that year, the object then being ‘‘ to furnish them practice 
in teaching while learning how to perform the duties required, under the supervision 
of a competent teacher, who shall be able to correct their errors, point out their de- 
fects, give adyice, and render all needful assistance. Under her instruction they 
Jearn how to organize a school, to classify the pupils, and so order the daily exercise, 
as to secure a complete systematic performance of all duties pertaining to the school.’ ”. e 
THE CITY TRAINING SCHOOL OF INDIANAPOLIS. 
In 1867 the training school of Indianapolis was established with the object not ‘to 
furnish intellectual ability, scholarship, or a natural aptitude to teach, but only to 
use these as the necessary material upon which todo its work.” To accomplish this 
the school was organized (we are using the report for 1869) with two departments, one 
for theory and the other for the practice of teaching. In the first ‘the method for 
some special point in a course of lessons is presented by means of an illustrative les- _ 
son, given to a class of children by the principal. This is followed by a discussion of 
the lesson for the purpose of fixing the plan in the minds of the pupil-teachers, and 
of elucidating the principles upon which the plan is based. The class is then required 
to prepare written exercises in which each member presents her own method for a 
similar or succeeding point. 
“The ability of the class to put in practice the knowledge thus gained is tested by 
requiring each member of the class in turn to give a lesson to a class of children. 
Subsequently the lesson so given is thoroughly criticised. The knowledge of prin- 
ciples thus gamed is made more complete and comprehensive by the study of text- 
books on school economy and meutal science, and readings from educational books, 
perodicals, etc.” ‘

and to impart a correct knowledge of the principles which underlie professional 
teaching.”

CURRICULUM OFFERED BY THE AMERICAN NORMAL SCHOOL ASSOCIATION IN 1870. 
Phe American Normal School Association, at its meeting in 1869, had appointed a 
committee ‘to consider and report upon the subject of a course of study adapted to 
normalschools.” Thecommittee reported that ‘ the supreme function of every school” 
was ‘“‘not merely to accomplish a given course of study, which is too often made an 
end unto itself, but to develop churacter ; » * * and it must be confessed that this 
end in a majority of cases is not realized. The value of a curriculum depends, first, 
upon its adaptation to the special purpose for which it is designed, and still more 
- upon the manner in which itis handled.” In the next place, says the committee, “there 
-js unquestionably a choice of studies to be regarded here. The studies to be pursued 
jn our training schools for elementary teachers ought, in a measure, to be determined 
not so much by the branches which are, put which ought tobe, taught in the common 
schools.” * a a ¢ ; 
The standard the committee would fix for admission to a normal school was (1) 
the ability to spell correctly; (2) a free and legible handwriting; (3) the power to 
read fluently and to enunciate with distinctness allordinary words of the language ; 
(4). the ability te parse and analyze any common English sentence; (5) the power to 
erform with facility all the processes to percentage; (6) a knowledge of the leading 
Frets of mathematical geography and of the political geography of the United States ; 
(7) satisfactory evidence of good moral character ; (8) asound, healthy body. Their

THE ERA OF DISCONTENT, 
Having conducted our inquiry to the close of the Civil War, and to a time 
when, as we shall see, much dissatisfaction began to appear with the work of the 
normal school, we shall not swell the bulk of our article by following the great de- 
velopment of academically inclined normal schools in the South subsequent to the War 
of the Rebellion, or those added to the category in the North and West. The stamp 
that had been given the normal-school course by a Pierce and developed by his suc- 
cessors began to want a unanimous consent to its value and propriety, either from the 
absence of a Pierce to conduct the work or from the absence of the crude conditions 
that made academic work valuable to the generations for which they immediately 
labored. When the historian of education in the United States shall have arisen and 
vindicated his claims, it will be shown, perhaps even by statistics, that an educa- 
tional renaissance set in upon us after 1870 that was in some measure stimulated 
by the great European activity in thé same line, In the education of the people, we 
gave Europe practice arid examples to a great extent; she imparted to us theory and 
criticism, 
It was about that epoch that this Office was established, and in the following we 
shall consult the pages of its reports in order to trace hurriedly the form in which the

iS To give an illustration of the professional basis attempted, and in ‘some instances 
: attained, during the eighth decade, we insert the argument of the principal of the 
normal school of St. Louis, made in 1880. It will be remembered that this school was 
i perhaps the first (‘ perhaps,” as it is ever dangerous to use unqualifiedly this ordinal 
adjective) to take its pupils from the high school. Mr. Soldan says: . 
S “The reason why a review and extension of the study of the common branches 
aa ahead form part of the professional training of the normal school may be stated as 
‘ollows: 
“4, The applica 
      ts to the school, as a rule, left the grammar school four years be- 
| fore resorting to the normal school (heist xh-school graduates), andit may be rea- 
: sonably supposed that, no matter how thoroughly they acquired the knowledge of 
common-school studies four years ago, they need a review to refresh their memories. 
«2. The teacher should not simply know as much of the grammat-school studies as 
- achild knows who has passed throngh a common school, but more; for she is to teach 
A them to others. jnere review of grammar-school work is hardly sufficient to give 
the amount of knowledge necessary in order to teach it to others. An extension of 
the work in the common branches beyond the limits of the grammax-school course is 
i i eos for the teacher, while it is not equally necessary for the general pursuits of 
page a: life. * ‘ 
«3, The study of methods of teaching, in order to be practically useful, should be 
a carried on at the beginning, in close connection with the subject-matter that is to be 
se taught. In other words, it is well enough to let the pupils study how to teach 
i geography according to the general principles of the science and of child nature, but 
4; is not less necessary that the special topics should be studied: in connection with 
f applied methods of teaching ; the pupil should learn, for instance, how tho form of 
, Z the earth or the change of seasons may be taught to a class. The normal-school 
at a pupil, as a part of her training, should review and continue Rue wotk. 
‘ . ‘And she looks upon it from the standpoint of the teacher anc tries to discover the \ 
pest way of presenting the matter to a class of children. Her recitation is a teaching 
exercise; she presents the subject she has studied and illustrates it as if she were to 
teach her classmates. Grammar-school work reviewed in this way is professional 
work and is essential to the training of efficient teachers.” 
In 1870 we find the principal of the Farmington Normal School saying, “Although 
the normal school in theory is a place for professional training—for teaching teachers 
how to teach—the facts do'not fully sustain the theory. We spend half of our time, 
or more, in teaching what should be known as a condition of entering. By one year 
devoted to training in methods of instruction, to mental science in its application to 
teaching, to the study of modes of school organization and educational history, to 
practice in mode! schools, etc., with classes fitly prepared for such work, we could 
accomplish more of real normal work than now can be accomplished in our whole 
course. We ought not to he forced to spend our time, as is often the case now, in 
teaching the rudiments of arithmetic, geography, and grammar.” — 
Tn the thirty-fourth annual report Of the Massachusetts Board of Education, their 
secretary says that classes in the voluntary course of two additional years had 
peen formed in each normal school of Massachusetts, the pupils being chiefly ‘‘former 
graduates who have learned from their experience in teaching the value of a more 
advanced scholarship.” He continues thus: «As is well known to the board, I have 
from the beginning been an earnest advocate of this higher course, as one means of 
meeting the rapidly growing demand for teachers of a thorough normal training, and 
also of a grade of scholarship superior to that which the normal schools had hitherto 
been able to give. Tt is a well-known fact that it is to-day impossible to supply the 
demand for female teachers of this grade.” h i 
‘The local board of management of the Buffalo, N. Y., school was considering the 
proposition ‘to rovide a department in which those who are suitably prepared and 
are willing to pay for tuition may prosecute a course of advanced study similar to 
that pursued in our colleges, except that it isto embrace instruction in the theory 
and practice of teaching and to be conducted throughont on normal principles.” 
To extend the normal course the committee thought would destroy its usefulness 
for the many, inasmuch as but few would have the time and means to pursue the 
added portion. i 
In 1871 the State superintendent of Pennsylvania, Mr, Wickersham, suggested 
that ‘‘the standard for admission be greatly elevated, so that the instraction of the 
grammar schoo] need not be repeated after entering the normal school;” and the 
common school commissioner of Ohio urges that ‘ academic instruction, except such 
as may be incidentally given in the illustration of methods, should be dispensed 
with that the science of education and the art of teaching may receive exclusive

attention.” Principal Phelps, of the Winona Normal School, in his report for 1872 ob- 
serves: ‘Our common schools have hitherto been and many of them still are in a 
weak and inefficient state. ‘The quality of the work done in them is very poor, and 
as the great bulk of the students entering the normal schools must come from these 
people’s colleges it is obvious that a large majority of them must come very poorly 
prepared. In fact, there isso much vague, loose, and inaccurate teaching still done 
in our elementary schools that at least nineteen-twentieths of those who enter the 
normal schools must go back to first principles, learn those subjects of which they 
are ignorant, and unlearn that which they have learned amiss. Not only are they 
ignorant of the very beginning of the common school studies, but they have no power — 
of expressing what they do know.” 
Again, Principal Beard, of the South Missoari State Normal School, observes: 
“Something is evidently wrong in our common school system of education. ‘The — 
majority of students entering our school we find know more of arithmetic than 
they know of all the other sciences taken together. * * * The designof the nor- 
mal school therefore should be to remedy these irregularities in the common schools.” 
In the report of the secretary of the State Board of Education of Massachusetts, 
that officer says: ‘‘I have attended the examination of the applicants for thenormal 
schools and have at such times severally made a very careful and critical examina- 
tion and analysis of the results presented in the papers of the applicants, An 
analysis made of one of these examinations is, I think, a fair specimen of all of them, 
The average age of the 48 examined was 18 years and9 months. Twenty-one of the 37 
ladies examined were graduates or had been members for some time of high schools, 
5 of academies, and 11 of grammar schools; 9 of them had taught school for a period 
yarying from 12 to 143 weeks. The questions were not above the average of those 
proposed to candidates for admission to our high schools. There should have been 
an average of at least 80 per cent. of correct answers. Only 4, however, had this 
average, and only 11 had 70 and upward; 18 had less than 60 percent. To attain 
even this result their reading had to be taken into account, for which they were 
marked much higher than for their written papers. With this the general average 
of correctness for all who were examined was 62 per cent. ; withoutit, 59. Yet only 
4 of the 48 were rejected. 5 
‘(An examination of the papers of these applicants shows that in too many cases the 
writers were allowed to take up the higher branches of study in high schools and 
academies before they had thoroughly mastered the simple elementary branches, 
which are the corner stone of a good education. The papers of many were very faulty 
in respect to the correct use of language, the construction of sentences, the use of 
capital letters, and spelling.” 
“The great value of these schools,” says the State superintendent of West Vir- 
ginia in 1872, “‘is the facility they afford tor a higher grade of education than can. 
be secured in the schools of inferior rank, * * * Our normal schools are valuable ~ 
as higher academies.” 
In 1874 the State superintendent of Maine, Mr. Johnson, after proposing a normal 
course of three years for the schools of Maine, one preparatory and probationary and. 
two properly normal, says: ‘The studies should be nearly as now appear in the 
course of study. * * ™ Insome future time we may be able to imitate the Vienna 
atrangement and establish a pedagogium—a normal school of normal schools—in 
which shall be received from the several sub-schools those students desirous of making 
further advancement.” 
In 1872 the Boston Normal School, which had become a mere high school for girls, 
was separated from the Boston High School and, in 1874~75, erected into an institution 
having for its first “regulation” the following : 
“The Boston Normal School is established for the purpose of furnishing an oppor- 
tunity for such young women as wish to become teachers, a thorough course of dis- 
tinct professional instruction, and to fit themselves for teachers in the public schools 
of Boston.” 
To enter, the candidate must be proficient in the studies of the high schools of Bos- 
ton and have attained the age of 17. The course was of one year and embraced | 
the following studies: 
1, Mental and moral science and logic. 6. Grammar school studies with reference to 2, History and principles of education, school teaching, management, and methods of instruction. 7, Drawing and its use asa means of illustration | 3. Physiology and hygiene. in teaching and vocal music, 4, Physics and natural history with reference to | 8 Observation and practice in primary and gram- objective teaching. mar schools. 5. Study of language; its history, acquisition, and analysis. 
Commenting on this curriculum the committee on normal schools observes that the 
requirements for admission were not high and ‘it is hoped that many will ex- 
ceed them ; that they will take a fourth or even fifth year of general study,” so that 
those who enter the school will be prepared ‘‘for a year of close and professional

study.” In 1876 the city superintendent, speaking of the schoo stashed in 1852, 
says that ‘itis hardly an exag, eration to say that during almost the whole period 
that has elapsed since the establishment of the school the arrangements and provisions 
for giving the requisite normal training to female teachers for our public schools 
have been “insufficient and unsatisfactory.” Speaking of the new school the same 
authority says: ‘‘Its course of training is ‘but one year, but it is exclusively profes- 
sional. The four great pedagogical pranches—psychology, physiology, ethics, and 
logic—are here judiciously handled.” c i 
Tn 1875 the deputy superintendent of Pennsylvania, Mr. Curry, after a thorough ex- 
amination of the normal schools of that State, says (remarking, however, that in some 
schools the candidates were quite up to the requirements for graduation in the ele- 
mentary course), “ But in others the course has been practically abridged by restrict- 
ting the study of ‘non of the branches to the contents of superficial text-books, too   
meager to furnish more than a fragmentary knowledge of principles involved.” 
“In 1876 the superintendent of public instruction of New York began to attack most 
determinedly the academical features of the eight normal schools of New York. He 
_ saysin hisreport fo 1876 (dated 1877): ‘‘For myself Iam freo to say that I would greatly 
prefer to have oo a schools what they profess to be—institutions simply and 
solely for the training of teachers for the common schools of the State. They ought 
to be mainly schools where those in attendance should be taught how to teach, hav- 
ing reasonably fai understanding of what to teach. The young person who is ap- 
pointed a pop in a State normal school is required to possess a good English educa- 
tion, Asi understand it, the function of the normal school is to teach this young 
person how to impart successfully to others the knowledge which he or she may 
_possess, how to govern a school, how to win the confidence of pupils, and how to in- 
struct them to obtain from books knowledge of an order far higher than that which 
_the teacher possesses. It ought not to be expected that the State should, in a few 
localities, support pee schools and colleges.” ote 
The bold move of the State superintendent to improve the State normal schools was 
simultaneous with another on the part of the governor suggesting the expediency of 
abolishing them. On June 11, 1877, the superintendent discontinued the academic 
departments in the normal schools, but the legislature in 1878 requested him to re- 
voke his order. 
In 1877 the principal of the State Normal School at Ypsilanti, Mich., remarks 
that the agranion of 16 graduates from high schools was @ “new feature” that 
promised much good to the normal school, as it would insure that those who thus 
obtained admission were more qualified to follow the course. The work of the school 
was divided into two departments, one called scholastic or academic and the other 
professional. ‘Such is the low condition of common school instruction in the State,” 
says the principal, “thata considerable portion of the instruction is to impart knowl- 
edge and discipline; but as these are required for a definite purpose, our methods of 
instruction are directed to that end.” * * * ‘Professional instruction, however, 
should be the peculiar feature of the work of a normal school, and it is the constant 
effort of the faculty to make this feature more and more prominent every year.” The 
same tendency towards a more professional status is quite as obseryable in the schools 
of Minnesota about this time. 1 
In 1878 the board of visitors of the Michigan State Normal School, after an examin- 
ation on two different oceasions, spoke thus in regard to that institution: 
“ As to the general question of normal instruction, your committee recognizes the 
difficulty of finding a satisfactory solution. The first object of the normal school is, . 
as the name implies, instruction in the art of teaching. It is, however, inevitable in 
the present condition of things that this should be supplemented by purely academic 
e tendency has always been to give what seemed to many persons 
a disproportionate share and attention to what should be in strictness only subordi- 
nate. This seemed to usto be the case at Ypsilanti. At the time of our visit there, our 
opinion was substantially that of the visitors of last year, that the normal school 
ayas more like an excellent academy, with some excellent instruc ion given in peda- 
gogics and the science of education, than a normal school proper. * * * With the 
growth of the school system, with the increase in the number of graded and high 
schools, the necessity of academic instruction in the normal school becomes less im- 
perative, and the disproportionate time and attention bestowed upon it more offen- 
sive. 
The visitors then speak of the reorganization that had been made since their last 
visit ‘to look more closely into certain matters, concerning which complaints had 
been made,” and continue oe 
“We sincerely hope that the requirements for admission, as set forth in the pro- 
spectus, may not be at all lowered, The catch-all common school course of the past 
7 years, with its low standard of requirements, its diploma, and its constantly in- 
creasing roll of graduates’ has been the bane of the normal school. We earnestly 
hope for better things in the future.” ’

In the report of the visitors for the following year (all new men as compared with 
their immediate predecessors), the following opinion is expressed : 
“With the new building, it was fitting there should be this new life. We believe 
the normal school is doing a good work—work that must necessarily render our schools 
more efficient ; yet the maximum has not been reached. Much remains to be done 
before it takes its rightful position in the educational system of the State.” 
The changes referred to are noticed in our Annual Report for 1878, at page 123; 
those particularly applicable in this connection are, (1) the division of the normal 
course proper into common school, higher English, and language courses ftting 
teachers respectively for the lower and higher grades in the State common and graded 
schools; (2) higher requirements of admission ; and (3) professional instruction. 
The remarks of the superintendent of the Boston schools on the question of the 
normal school, then much agitated in Boston, are given inour Report for 1879 at page 
Ixxviii, and it is not thought necessary to repeat them here. Secretary Dickinson, of. 
the Massachusetts Board of Education, says under date of January, 1880: ‘A teach- 
er’s seminary should have for its special object the training of teachers to teach. 
This includes a thorough study of the philosophy of teaching, and a discussion of: a 
course of studies embracing an elementary and scientific course, It includes also as 
much practice as possible in teaching in experimental schools, the topics of the 
course of studies made out, and to such pupils as will study the same topics in the 
public schools, and lastly a study of the best methods of school organization and 
school government. If the normal ‘schools are to be confined pretty closely to their 
legitimate work, the standard for admission to their classes must be raised. ” 
CHAIRS OF PEDAGOGICS. 
Towards the close of the eighth decade two terms not before in common use began to 
appear with considerable frequency, pedagogics and didactics, both used it seems as 
different names for the same thing, the science, or the science and art of teaching. 
But one of them was an old term in the University of Iowa, where the degree of 
bachelor of didacties was oftered in 1870 to those who would complete an ‘advanced 
course” for one year and teach for two years successfully, ‘This advanced course may 
be considered as a purely professional one, and finally in 1873 became a ‘ chair,” hay- 
ing the design to prepare teachers for advanced schools ; ‘‘ hence” says the catalogue, 
“only those academical seniors who intend to become teachers and special students, 
who may become qualified to be classed with them, will be allowed to pursue nor- 
mal studies.” In 1878a ‘‘college of normal instruction” was opened in the univer- 
sity and granted the ‘‘ academic normal degree of bachelor in pedagogics” to those 
graduates of one of the four academical courses who took also one semester of higher 
pedagogics; but itis the Chair of the Science and Art of Teaching in 1879 in the 
University of Michigan that will best enable us to show the stage of advancement 
that the pedagogical public had attained to as regards education as a science. © 
The object contemplated in establishing this chair, says Professor Payne, who oc- 
cupied it, was ‘‘to fit students for the higher positions in the public school service,” 
“a natural fanction of the university as the head of our [the Michigan] system of 
public instruction; ” ‘to give a more general diffusion to educati¢nal doctrines,” which 
involves human interests of the highest order; ‘‘ to promote the study of educational 
science;” ‘to teach the history of education,” ‘‘to promote the transformation of 
teaching from an occupation to a profession,” for ‘the very basis of professional ac- 
tivity is in an articulate body of doctrine.” 
The courses were as follows: 
1. First semester: Practical, embracing school supervision, grading, courses of _ 
study, examinations, the art of instructing and governing, school architecture, school 
hygiene, school law, ete. 4 
2. Second semester: Historical, philosophical, and critical, embracing the history 
of education, the comparison and criticism of the systems of different countries, the 
outlines of educational science, the science of teaching, a critical discussion of theo- 
ries and methods. : 
The first course was evidently intended to cover the duties of a superintendent. 
The second course may be illustrated by the following topics, which were a part of it: 
Analysis and synthesis as related to method, acquisition, the office of books:in educa- 
tion, empirical law of conduct; Comenius; the comprehensive nature of education as 
a liberal study, plastic theory of development theory; the two factors in primary in- 
struction, art of interpretation, ete,

preparation of a programme for the normal schools for men an women, established 
or about to be estal lished, began to solicit from foreign lands such information as 
would enable them to know what other countries had done in the same direction.

germane to the subject-matter of this paper. '

THE HIGHER NORMAL SCHOOLS (&COLE NORMALE SUPERIRURE D’INSTITUTRICES) OF FRANCE. i 
Under date of July 13, 1880, the minister of public instruction and fine arts made 
the following report to the President of the French Republic: 
“Mr, PRESIDENT: The law of the 9th of August, 1879, imposes the duty on each 
department to provide, within four years, a normal school for women who desire to 
prepare themselves for teaching ; while the decree of the 5th of June last has es‘ab- 
jished an examination for the persons who are to become directors or professors of 
these schools, which requires special knowledge on the part of candidates for these 
ositions. 
¥ “The Government is thus placed under the necessity of providing in a compara- 
tively short time a numerous personnel that is to fulfill conditions as to aptitude more ° 
difficult than those which have obtained in the past. Under these conditions the Gov- c 
ernment is concerned to find the means of making headway against the difficulties of 2 
the situation. - HS 
“Excluding the idea of individual preparation (which would be very insufficient), 
different measures have been proposed. Some would create a normal course in each 
academy ;! others would establish a fourth year of study to the existing course of the 
normal schools, But it is not possible to see the results of these two combinations, 
      
    Moreover, the putting them in practice presents difficulties. * ce 
“ The educational press has proposed that a beginning be made by creating a higher gy 
elementary normal school (école normale primaire supérieure), and a bill for the estab- ae 
lishment of a high school of pedagogy for women has been presented. Without wait- i re 
ing for the legislature to pass upon this bill and without intending to prejudge as to 
the final character of the projected establishment, it seems to me necessary to take 
‘Phe University of France is composed of seventeen “academies.” ‘These academies are not build- ings, but educational jurisdictions. ‘The departments are subdivisions of the academy.

- those steps during the current year which if not taken will ‘make it yar difficult to_ 
provide a personnel sufficiently well prepared for the normal schools which are about 
to be opened.” ad Cay ‘ ; ' 
‘The same day the President of the Republic signed the decree establishing the school, 
which is now known as the Ecole Normale Supérieure d’Institutrices, Fontenay-aux- 
Roses. i t ep 
‘On the 30th of December, 1882, the following order was issued “relative to the con- 
ditions of admission to the higher elementary normal school for women at Fontenay- 
aux-Roses”: t f 4 
Arr. 1, An examination for admission to the higher elementary school for women 
at Fontenay-aux-Roses is held every year during July. 
‘Art. 2. To enable the candidate to compete, she must be unmarried or a widow, 
and not less than 20 years and not more than 25 years of age at the date of October 
1 of the year in which she presents herself for examination. She must have made en- 
gagement for 10 years as provided in the decree of the 29th of July, 1#81,! and must-be 
provided with a higher brevet? or a college diploma (dipléme de bachelier)*, Finally, 
to produce a physician’s certificate, stating her ability to perform the duties of a

OxssEcT: (a) From a theoretical standpoint: yer 
First. The students should learn to teach each of the different branches of the 
school curriculum, and understand the school organization in general. a 
Second, The knowledge of psycological facts and the scientific laws of education 
should permit them to work in such’a way as will enable them to cultivate and 
develop their future pupils. a at 
Third. The history of pedagogy (and that of school institutions) should familiar- ~ 
ize the pupil with the development of this science and present to him noble ex- 
amples to emulate in his future career. 
(b) From a practical point of view : 
The students should be enabled to apply the knowledge that the theoretical in- 
struction has given them. ‘ 
      PLAN OF STUDIKS. 
Third class: Oral and written exercises of chatechetical teaching, upon easy sub- 
jects, accompanying the usual lessons in each branch of the plan of studies. 
Second class (five hours) : (1) Catechetical exercises upon more difficult, subjects; 
more personal redaction of written lessons (rédaction plus personelle des lecons 
écrites) ; beginning of practice in listening to model lessons, and practice lessons given 
to a few pupils. (2) Methodology: This instruction should familiarize the students 
with the general principles and the special method of the- different branches of the 
programme of the primary school and make them acquainted with the most usual 
and best use of the means of instruction. (3) Psychology; its relations with physi-. =. 
ology (as an introduction to pedagogy): First class, four hours: (1) Science of edu- e 
cation, physical and intellectual, of man; (2) history of pedagogy and of the pri- 
mary school, especially since the Reformation. 
Practical exercises: The students are exercised in their profession by teaching in the 
practice school. In order that the practice school children may not suffer from the eet 
‘inexperience and errors of the normal school pupils, the normal school pupil is 
required to prepare himself for the teaching that he is to be called upon to give. To 
this end there are ‘‘ lessons of preparation,” in which the details of the proposed les- 
son in the practice schoul is written out and corrected by the professor. The nurmal ¥ 
pupils who do not participate in teaching must be present regularly when lessons : 
are given to the practice school children by the ordinary instructors of the school or t 
by normal school pupils. They must, in addition each week in turn, make an at- 
tempt to teach (legon d’essai) upon a subject selected from one of the different sub- 
jects of the programme, The preparation of these essays at teaching should be done ees 
in the same manner as the lessons given in the school of application.

in general. Inir roducing the science of teaching the logical relations which are the      
     i 
  most readily apprehended are taught by means of examples taken from the experience 4 
of the pupils. The programme comiprehends, in addition, the methods, forms, and 
means of teaching, the principles of educative teaching, as well as that which con- 
cerns the persons who receive and give instruction and the places where it is given. 
During the second semester (two hours a week) special methods are tanght. The 
branches of the clementars school are passed inreview. The usual books are used, and 
the best means of teaching and the best books treating of methods and elementary 
instruction indicated. seit 
Practical exercises: The students of the third year are present during the lessons 
even in the practice school, one hour a week during the first semester, two hours 
luring the second. They commence with the lowest class of the practice school and 
pags successively through the several grades of instruction. As far as possible, es- 
pecially in the beginning, the normal pupils are brought together in a class room and 
are instructed to observe attentively and to note down their observations. 
Each pupil must write out a short statement of each lesson at which he has been 
present. These statements are criticised in a weekly conference of one hour, the 
director of the normal school presiding, the professor of dae y, the regular teach- 
ers of the practice school, and, in the second semester, the professor of special meth- 
odology assisting. 1

In the preparatory conference, which is held under the presidency of the director, 
with the assistance of the professors of special methodology and the regular teachers 
of the practice school, the plan of work for each week is fixedin advance. The object 
is to occupy the targest number possible at the same time and to afford to each stu- 
dent an opportunity to employ himself practically during the course of the year in) 
each branch and each grade. As far as possible each student should have the oppor- 
tunity of prolonging, at least in one subject, his exercises for a certain time. The 
normal pupils may be required to prepare themselves for their practical exercise by 
writing them out,should it be thought necessary. ‘ 
The essays in teaching made by the normal school pupils oceur in groups under 
the direction of the teachers of the practice school, who communicate subsequently, 
to the normal school pupils, the result of their observation of this practice, work 
(three hours a week), 
Each week certain essays at teaching are made in the presence of all the pupils of 
the nofimal school under the presidency-of the director, who is assisted by the pro- 
fessor of methods of the branch taught and by the teacher of that branch in the 
school (two hours a week). 
These essays at teaching become the object of a conference at the close of each 
week, in which the normal school pupils take part as well as the members of the fac- 
ulty who are interested (i. ¢., whose subjects are involved). In this conference the 
more important events that have happened during the week in the institution are 
discussed in order to habituate the pupils to think upon questions of administration 
and education and to familiarize them with the duties of a teacher. (Two hours a 
week are given to the preparatory conferences and ‘‘conférences de critique.”) 
When circumstances permit, the normal pupils visit the elementary schools of the 
locality, accompanied by their professors. - 
In every grade of study, private reading is an auxiliary to the course. In order to 
accomplish this the students should have at. command appropriate works on*general 
pedagogy, didactics,and special methods. To insure that such works have been care- 
fully read the students should be called upon to render an account thereof either by 
word of mouth or in writing. 
WOMEN. 
The text of the plan of studies is the same, as far as pedagogy is concerned, as for 
men, except the following paragraph, : 
Inthe normal schools for women to which is annexed a kindergarten,'the pupils 
of the third and fourth year employ a portion of the time devoted to practical exer- 
cises, to the exercises of the same kind in the kindergarten.

Lower class.—In this class one or two hours a week are given to the several ques- 
tions relative to the physical and mental development of the individual, and to 
public and private education, by taking as a point of departure the observations 
made in the family and in the school by the students themselves, in order to awaken 
in them a propensity to observe psychological and pedagogical facts, and thus to pre- 
pare them for the systematic instruction in pedagogy that comes later on, 
Intermediate class.—Psychology (three hours a weels): The instruction in psychol- 
ogy has the object to give a clear conception of the organism and the evolution of 
the subjective mind (esprit subjective) from the lower degrees. of the soul’s activity 
to the rgalization of intellectuality, It comprehends: 
(a) The evolution of the soul to intellectuality (Vesprit). 
b) The faculties of the mind (Pesprit). 
te The particular characteristics of the mind. 
Higher class.—General pedagogy (three hours a week): The instruction in general 
pedagogy has the objeet to give the student scientific ideas upon education in gen- 
eral, in order to permit him to study pedagogical works unaided, and to form an exact 
and complete idea of the end, as well as the ways and means of education in the 
elementary school. It treats: 
(a) Of the essence of education. : 
(b) Of the elements of education, i qh op 
(c) Of the work of education. ' is { 
Practical pedagogy (three hours a week): Practical pedagogy is essentially th 
- science of school organization in the widest sense of the word. By it the pupil learns 
to recognize, on one side, the relation of the elementary school to domestic education 
and to the other establishments for popular education; on the other side he learns 
the task which the public school has to accomplish, the means of accomplishing it, 
and the historical development of our system of public instruction. 
The instruction comprelends the following divisions : ‘ 
(a) The family and the school = The relation between domestic education and public 
education, educational establishments in their organie totality, the primary school, 
its definition, its end, its means of activity. : 
. (b) Education in the primary school: Discipline and instruction in the elementar, 
_ gchool, the organization of elementary instruetion in general and the proper ie 
to follow in teaching each branch in particular. 
(c) The principal facts of the history of pedagogy, especially in what concerns the 
elementary aaitiel, | } , : 
Concurrently with the instruction in practical pedagogy, exercises in methods are 
given in the practice school which are criticised in the conferences which the pupils 
fave as a class with the teacher of the practice school. 
The pupils of the middle and highest classes are present, turn about, either one 
alone or two together, at the lessons in the practice school. ‘This occurs twice a year 
and lusts a week. for each time. While the student so detailed is present in the

  practice school he is under the control of the regular teacher of that school, who, 
however, gives him a certain amount of freedom, reporting at the end of the week as 
to the pupil’s conduct. The pupil.on his part keeps a journal in which he notes the 
lessons and other duties of the different classes of the practice school and his ob- 
servations. 
Towards the end of the school year all the students of the highest class are present 
forsome days during the lessons in the practice school or schools of the neighbor- 
hood, recejving on these occasions supplementary instruction in school-keeping.

The object of the normal school being to educate persons so as to render them ex- 
pert in the art of education, the most important study is pedagogy, which has edu- 
‘eation for its particular object. The professors of the other studies have it in hand 
to furnish the normal pupil with the information which is necessary to train the       
     
-P-A-G-E-384
   
      
  : : ‘ Te ise ‘ 
mind, and indirectly to train these normal pupils to impart this information to their 
fature pupils in the elementary school; but the professor of pedagogy’s duty is not 
only to teach his pupils the maxims of the science of education, but especially to be 
_ their guide and master in the art of methodically communicating the information 
acquired, But general maxims and rules of method are the products of particular 
observations and of experience, and without actual experiments the students are 
neither able to comprehend them nor to appreciate the results. Tt follows from this 
that pedagogy should be taught according to a plan rigorously experimental, and 
that practice ought not only to form the base but the crown. i 
Practice consists in part of the remembrance of personal experience, in part of the 
observations that have been made while teaching, and finally, in part, of the commu- 
nications that have been recéived from another. The memories of personal experi- 
ence contribute to produce the effect desired if all the professors of the school, each 
working to do his part towards the gradual development of the pupil’s mind, are 
careful to conform to the maxims of general pedagogy and to the rules of special 
method taught by the professor of pedagogy. The observation of another has no 
practical value, atleast so far as can be ascertained by experiment, for the purpose 
of producing real. educational results. It, therefore, follows that the principal foun- 
dation of practice is the observations that one makes while teaching. On this ac- 
count the practical exercises in the school are of so much importance. While offer- 
ing the material for observation and an occasion to apply abstract theory, they serve 
to form and to perfect professional ability which assumes that the pupil has the nec- 
essary talent for the work. f 
Having thus determined the role of the professor of pedagogy, it remains to sum- 
marily indicate the programme that he should follow. 
(The students of the first course do not receive lessons in pedagogy.) 
Second course.—Definition of education and instruction. The family and the school. 
Ideas as to the development of thefaculties of the human mind. Manner in which the 
development ought to accord with the acquisition of knowledge. ‘The activity of the 
intelligence in particular. Method, its principles, character, and means, general results 
thatitshould produce. The form of instruction. ‘The school in general, place of the 
elementary school in the organization of public instruction. Studies and programme 
of elementary instruction. Special methods for teaching each of the subjects of the 
programme in the different classes of primary schools. Pedagogical organization of 
infant schools. Organization of an elementary school, as to matters of study, as to 
persons and the division of time. | 
Pedagogy: The intellectual development of man; character of each stage of this 
development. Foundation and directing principles of education. Laws and means 
of action of education. Duties and role of the educator. Habits. Education in its 
different relations with the several ages of man. Forms of education: Home, school, 
individual, collective [social? ]. Laws and special means which should regulate the 
development of the faculties of each order. Physical, intellectual, esthetic, and 
moral education 
Third course. f e matters taught in an elementary way in the preceding course 
   are reviewed in in a more thorough and methodical way. 
Necessity for the education of man. Definition of education. Possibilities and

upon Italian institutions and methods, and upon the great educators of Italy. 
Practical exercises: (1) Upon each subject taught in the elementary school, each 
professor giving to his class oral or written lessons as an exercise in methods. 
(2) The students give once a week a lesson in the model school under the direction 
of the professor of pedagogy and the professor of the branch which is being taught. 
After this practical exercise the normal pupils’ classmates criticise the manner in 
which the lesson has been given and the professor of pedagogy gives judgment on the 
different remarks that have been made. 
(3) The students are present at the lessons of the model school, and the time as- 
signed to each exercise is so divided that the normal students of the first two courses 
shall be able to be present during all the lessons in the lower practice school classes, 
ane those of the third course during the lessons given to the higher practice school 
classes. 
The normal school pupils who have not yet commenced the study of pedagogy are 
limited to listening or employed as monitors in the lower classes, When they haye 
reached the study of special methodology, they give essay lessons upon each branch 
- of the curriculum, under the direction of the regular teacher of the practice school. 
Finally, they prepare, under the direction of the regular teacher of the model school,

B eA week the normal school pupils make up a report in which they speak of the 
observations they have made as well as of the work they have done while employed in 
the practice school. The professor of pedagogy examines these reports before the 
class, and takes pains to develop among his pupils a spirit of reflection and observa-

General methodology: Method follows from the study of psychology and is based 
upon the laws of mental evolution. Foundation of a good method of elementary — 
instruction insisting on the following points: 2 
The instruction should be based as far as possible upon sensible intuition. It should 
provoke constantly the mental activity of the pupil and be a veritable gymnastic of 
the senses and faculties. It is not only necessary that the child should see, observe, 
analyze, compare, and judge, it is aiso necessary that he invent and create. Intel- 
Jectiial work should correspond to the stage of the development of the faculties and 
not be causéd to impede phydiasl development. The child should be accustomed to 
express simply but correctly his own observations and judgments, Nothing should 
be left to the memory that has not been seized by the intelligence. Itis necessary to 
teach things, not words. It is necessary to go from the simple to the complex, from 
the concrete to the abstract, when speaking of what is not familiar to the child. It 
is necessary to awaken in the child a lively interest for the object of the lesson. It 
is necessary to go slowly, to return frequently to the simpler ideas, to make numer- 
ous applications and frequent repetitions, but to vary the exercise, to give “a hun- 
dred aspects” to what the child has learned. It is necessary that education and 
instrugtion should go hand in hand; for all the branches that are taught should con- 
cur in giving the pupil a general culture and prepare him to continue alone the 
further work of educating himself. ' 
The different general procedures of method: Analysis, synthesis, observation, ex- 
perimentation, induction, deduction, forms of teaching, modes of teaching, exercises 
of the elementary pupil, repetition, examination. 
Special methodology: Theoretical and practical exposition of the method that 
should be followed in teaching each of the branches of the official programme for 
elementary schools. 2 
V. Discipline.—Some practical lessons upon the system of discipline adopted in the 
practice school in order to prepare the normal pupils of the second year to teach in 
that school. i 
VI. Practical exercises.—The students are present in the school of application, one 
hour weekly (throughout the year) while the professor of methodology, and the teach- 
ers of the practice school givelessons. The students witness the teaching exercises of 
the third-year students, and summarize their observations and hand them to the pro- 
fessor of methodology. During the last session the students are more intimately 
connected with the exercises of the practice school.

of methodology and by the teachers, in the practice school. Once a week there are 
didactic exercises which consist of (1) a lesson given by a normal-school pupil in the 
presence of his classmates; (2) criticism of such work; (3) the synopsis, by one or 
more students designated for the purpose, of the discussion thus evoked. : 
The teaching exercises take place under the direction of the professor of pedagogy, 
the director of the normal school, the professor of the branch in which a lesson is 
being given, and the teachers of the practice school. The subject to be taught is 
selected two days in advance and is prepared by all the normal-school pupils. He 
who is to give the lesson is designated by lot on the morning of the day on which 
the lesson is to be given. Before a student may teach a second time each of his | 
classmates shall have had a turn. 
The exercises of the practice school are regulated in such a way that each stu- — 
dent bas an opportunity to give six half-hour lessons each week. The bulletins, 
successively sent to each normal-school pupil, form a series embracing every branch 
ofthe curriculum. Each student is taught to direct a class of two and even of three 
divisions. ‘lhe students are required to prepare the lessons and to submit them to 
the examination of the teacher in charge of the practice-school division to whose 
pupils the lesson isto be given. The professor of methodology examines the students’ 
note-books containing these lessons of preparation once a month. Each student cor- 
rects, under the supervision of a teacher, a certain amount of the practice-school pa- 
pils’ work which they have done under his teaching.

author, together with a course of twenty lectures upon words and their uses, the 
¢ proper construction of sentences, and the correct use of language, and the beauties 
and defects of style as found in the writings of standard authors. 
3. Hygiene.—In this subject a course of twenty lectures is given on the preservation 
of health, the air we breath, the food we eat, the clothing we wear, the fluids we drink, 
and the physical and mental exercise necessary for the highest development of man. 
4, Chemistry.—Thirty lectures on elementary chemistry are given, illustrated by 
,simple experiments. The objects are (1) to make the experiment understood, (2) to 
have the students explain it, (3) to cause the student to reason on natural phenom- 
ena, and (4) to enable the student to repeat the experiment when a teacher. There 
is laboratory work under supervision of a science master. i 
5. Botany.—This subject is made as practical as possible by the examination of 
specimens collected from time to time, and consists of a course of twenty lectures, em- 
bracing the chemistry and histology of plant life, the structure of flowering plants, 
and the general classification of plants. 
6. Zodlogy.—A general outline of this subject is given in a course of twenty lectures. 
7. Physics.—The course in this subject consists of a series of thirty lectures upon 
heat, light, and electricity. In this, asin chemistry, great importance is attached 
to the explanation of the physical phenomena of daily life. 
8. Drawing.—This subject is taught by a specialist, who gives a course of forty les- 
sons, in-which designing, model drawing, free-hand, perspective, constructive draw- 
ing, scientific perspective, and practical geometry are taught. 
9. Music.—This subject is also taught by a specialist, and consists of a course of 
forty lessons, in whieh the scales and their various transpositions are taught, com- 
bined with the singing of songs in two, three, and four parts. 
10. Calisthenics.—The course in this subject consists of a series of calisthenic exer- 
cises, under the direct supervision of a competent drill master. 
11. Military drill.—The exercises in this subject are taught similarly to those in 
calisthenics and by the same person. i 
12. Methods of instruction.—A course of 115 lectures in which the following subjects 
are reviewed with the object of illustrating the best methods of teaching them, viz: 
Language lessons, grammar, composition, spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic, 
algebra, Euclid and mensuration, history, geography, and object lessons. 
13. Practical teaching.—During the early part of each session the students, accompa- 
nied by the normal school-masters, are required to visit the model school and observe 
the methods of teaching the different subjects, as practically illustrated by the teach- 
ers in the model school. They are also required to observe the methods adopted for 
securing attention and interesting the pupils in their work. After sufficient oppor- 
tunies have been given to the students of witnessing the manner in which the differ- 
‘ent subjects are taught in the model schools, they are called upon to teach before 
each other in the normal school, under the guidance and supervision of the masters, 
and to criticise each other’s teaching in a friendly way. 
14. School law.—Under this head is given a knowledge of the elementary principles 
of law and of their application under the statute of trustees, teachers, inspectors, etc. 
Finally they are required to take charge of classes in the model school, under the 
supervision of the teachers, and are expected to teach at least three times in each 
department of the model school. : 
._. There are two sessions of the two normal schools in each year. The first opensin 
January and closes in June, the second opens in August and closes in December. 
Candidates for admission are required to comply with the tollowing conditions, viz: 
To be native born or naturalized subjects of Her Majesty; to have passed the pre- 
_ scribed examination for second-class non-professional certificates; to hold a third- 
class professional certificate or its equivalent; to have taught successfully for at 
Jeast one year as certified to by the public school inspector in whose inspectorate the 
teaching was done; to give satisfactory evidence of good moral character at the time 
* of making application; and, if females, to be not less than eighteen years of age, 
and, if males, nineteen.

First section of t 
of the session the 
class as above the principal first lays before the students the plan of the lesson and 
illustrates this plan by his teaching. He also requires the students to take notes of 
_ his methods and these are discussed in the criticism hour. In this way about ten 
lectures, combined with illustrative teaching, are given on the best methods of 
teaching some of the primarysubjects. During this time the students are not required. 
to visit the different departments of the school for observation, as it is believed that 
no one can observe intelligently or with profit until he has some idea of the object to 
be attained by the teacher. | 
(2) The students having noted and discussed the methods as outlined by the prin- 
cipal and having observed the practice of these methods are now themselves prepared. 
to begin to teach. They are therefore next required to teach classes in the separate 
students after the conclusion of the lesson. 
(3) Observation: The principal next prepares the students for taking observation 
in the different rooms set apart for model school purposes, their attention being 
specially called to the matter of the lesson, to the method of presenting it, and to 
the class. 
Second section of term (three weeks).—(1) Observation and class teaching in the sepa- 
rate room in (a) observing class teaching by the principal, (0) class teaching before the 
principal and their fellow students, (c) criticisms.

students are engaged in observing teaching by the assistants in the different rooms 
and in taking notes. These notes are afterwards given-to the principal and dis- 
cussed in the separate room. The assistant teachers are required to explain to the 
attention to points in the progress of the lesson, and to summarize at the close. 
Third section of term (seven weeks).—Teaching by. students in the divisions: The 
subjects themselves under the direction of the principal, having observed how classes 
are taught by the assistants, and having some idea of the matter and method of a 
lesson, are now able to take charge of classes in the subjects already illustrated. The 
assistant teachers are required to take notes of the work done by the students and to

CHAPTER XII. 
THE THACHING FORCE QF NEW ENGLAND FROM 1866 TO 
1888," 
  PURPOSE AND CONDITIONS OF THE STUDY. 
In no other manner can statistics be»sed to greater advantage than by employing 
them in the spirit of the ‘ historical method.” Especially valuable is this’ method 
when applied to the study of educational affairs. Had statistics of the teaching 
force been given by all or by a majority of the States of the Union some conclusions 
of a definite nature might have been drawn from comparing State with State, but _ 
such a comparison of synchronous facts is far different from comparing the present 
condition of a State with its record at times past—from comparing it with itself. 
From the fullness of their statistics, the New England States have been selected 
as best adapted to the purposes of the historical view of the condition of the teaching 
force that we are about to undertake. It must not be supposed, however, that the 
statistics of the six New England States are uniform or complete ; quite the contrary. 
But such as they are we shall attempt to use them to show the movement in the past 
and the present condition of the teaching body in each of the several States of the 
section under review: (1) As to the annual changes that occur; (2) the proportion 
of men to women; (3) the average wages paid; and finally, and most important for . 
the purpose of this chapter, (4) the number of inexperienced persons that enter upon 
teaching, and the educational attainments of the teaching force, as far as those 
attainments are indicated by the place.of education. 
In selecting a period at which a beginning shall be made in prosecuting this under- 
taking, that has been chosen which saw the termination of the War of the Rebellion. » 
The call to arms undoubtedly caused many vacancies in the teaching corps. Mon- 
sieur F. Buisson, president of the French educational commission to the Centennial 
Exhibition at Philadelphia, observes in his report on elementary instruction in the 
country in 1876: 
‘In the United States the teaching corps is made up ofa large number of females, 
to whom classes containing boys of every age are frequently intrusted. The superi- 
ority of the female element of the teaching body over the male in point of numbers 
dates from the war of secession, the original cause being the voluntary enrollment 
of all the young men who were teaching, as soldiers.” 
In 1862 the superintendent of Ohio estimates that 5,000 teachers in that State had 
entered the Northernarmy. One can surmise without fear of contradiction that the 
case was not otherwise in the South.? 
One of the most annoying tasks of the statistician, though one in which he would 
seem to take particular delight from the frequency with which he discusses the mat- 
ter, is the imperfection of his statistics. Without dwelling then on this subject, we 
will mention two points that should be remembered. | First, in obtaining the ratios of 
Tabulation G we have given, wherever it was possible, the relation which the num- 
ber of teachers necessary to supply the schools bears to the different teachers em- 
ployed during the year. Were every ‘necessary place” filled and were there no 
mutual exchange of schools, and no promotions, this figure would be of more value 
than it is, as indicating the changes that have occurred during the year, to: say 
nothing of new schools and departments established during the interval elapsing be-   
1 See note, p 275. i seit ihe fourth annual report of the suporintendent of public instruction of Kansas, we find the fol: lowing : : “School teachers are proverbially patriotic. No class have boon more ready to do for their country. Illinois has furnished for the Army 3,000 teachers. Among these was Professor Hovey of the State Normal School. With him enlisted nearly a regiment of his own pupils. Obio sent 5,000; nearly half of her male teachers. New York sent from the schoolroom to the battlefield, 3,000 of her teach- ers.”

tween the beginning and closing of the school year. Second, as the “number of 
teachers necessary to supply the schools” has not been given in the case of Maine, 
New Hampshire, Vermont, and Connecticut, we have been obliged to use the number 
of “ public schools” or “ departments ” instead of the “number of teachers required” 
by the system. i "           
       
         
         
I.—SocraL CONDITIONS. * | 
Preparatory to canyassing the statistics of Tabulation L (p. 328) we will anticipate 
and illustrate one of its indications. It is evident that the columns of that table for 
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island show much more favorably for those 
States, considered either individually or collectively than similar columns for Maine, 
New Hampshire, and Vermont show for those States whether taken also individually 
or collectively. This suggests an inquiry as to the social conditions of the two 
: sections thus marked off by the figures, and first of all as to the geographical distri- 
; bution of the population of the two groups. The following tables will show how far 
¥ apart they are in this respect and in others. |

The indications of the first of these tabulations is corroborated by those of the 
second; although the villages of 1,000 to 4,000 have not been included. It is very 
evident that the New England States nay be separated into two groups, when con- 
sidered as to the density of their population. An examination of lithograph map 27, 
Vol. I, of the last census shows that the population of Vermont, Maine (southern 
art), and New Hampshire are quite evenly distributed over those States, while 
Wasnohnacite and Rhode Island have comparatively many centers of concentration 
of population. Connecticut is evenly divided into a rural and urban society. 
Having ont distribution of population to vary so widely in the two groups   of States, our next inquiry is to ascertain what the industrial character of the popu- 
lation of each group is; for it is well known that manufactures flourish in New 
England. i 
MPhese percentages have been computed on the figures given on p. 416 et seq., of Vol. I, of the Con- 
sus of 1880, and not on those contained in the table on p. #3x of that volume.

As in the previous tables, these States were plainly divisible intotwo groups when 
considered as to geographical distribution of their respective population, so, too, in the 
case of the population employed in manufacture and mining and in agriculture may 
they be placed in two groups, each group being made up of the same States as be- 
fore. It appeats from the figures that about 30 per cent. of the population over ten 
years of age are engaged in one of the two occupations which may be said to have the 
object of supplying the necessities of life—food and clothing. In Group I these occu- 
pations have very nearly an equal following ; in Group II no such equality appears. 
If the statistics for 1870 be compared with those of 1880, we tind that the two groups 
show very, much the saine thing, a tendency away from agriculture and towards in- 
dustries of an artisan cast. It will also be noticed, though the fact is well known 
perhaps, that the States of Group IL have received the largest increase to their pop- 
ulation ; and even New Hampshire, which is almost on a par with Connecticut as to 
manufactures, far surpasses her sisters of Group I in respect to the increment to her, 
population during the decade, : . , 
Bearing in mini that a factory is a nucleus of a town, the preceding tabulations 
are corroborated by this. 
It is not the people, however, who, immediately at least, support the schools, but 
the taxable property. Let us then coinpare the capital invested in manufaciures 
with the value of the farms. It is known that the valuation per capita of New 
England far exceeded that of any other section of the Union in 1880. It is necessary 
to ascertain if the States of this section differed among themselves as to the character 
of money values in the two particulars of manufacture and agriculture.

Disregarding Connecticut, it is evident that the other States of Group II have much 
more invested in manufactures than inagriculture. But the difference between Con- 
necticut and the other States of Group II is not nearly so great as that between the 
two groups. In Group I agricultural values are far in excess. Connecticut and New

Hampshire require a word of separate comment. In Tabulation C it is observable 
+ that the percentage of persons engaged in manufacture in New Hampshire is much 
larger than the same percentage for the other States of Group I; while in the case of 
Connecticut the percentage of persons engaged in agriculture is much larger than the 
# other States of Group II. In the tabulation under consideration the capital in Con- 
necticut invested in manufacture is Jarger per capita than in Massachusetts, and 
a , etc, per capita is larger than that of Maine, and it is doubtful 
whether Connecticut belongs to Group I or IT. Perhaps it would be more proper to 
consider it ag a State in which urban and rural life are equally wéll represented ; in 
a 3 fact, a State, from an educationist’s standpoint, worthy of study as a type. 
II.—PROFESSIONAL CONDITIONS. 
In the six communities thus circumstanced as to geographical distribution, oceu- 
pation, and. finances at the epoch of the censuses of 1870 and 1880, the phenomena 
represented in the following tables occurred during the eighth and ninth decades:

Had the Seite of schoolrooms under the charge of a single teacher been given, 
it would havé added materially to the value of the foregoing tabulation. Had the num- 
per of teachers and of supervisors not in charge of a schoolroom been given, the value 
of the table would have been still further edt anced If to these had been added the 
assistants (teachers) to teachers in charge of a single school and the assistants (teach- 
ers) to teachers or to supervisors not in charge of a single school, the table, if we are 
not greatly mistaken, might have been made to show, with all desirable accuracy, the 
number of teaching places fo be filled. Until some general attempt is made by those 
wy in whose hands the initiative lies to obtain complete statistics, the statistician will 
be compelled to guess, to patch, and to do the best under the circumstances. 
But though the reader may acquiesce in the propriety of dismissing thus summarily 
i the-question of heterogeneity, it would be inexcusable not to point out which of the 
x two meanings that the statistics we present are capable of conveying, is the true 
: one, In the case of Massachusetts, for instance, the “number of teachers required

-P-A-G-E-395
        THE TEACHING FORCE OF NEW ENGLAND. er ore 
by the public schools” (Report 1885-86) was8,275, the ‘‘number of persons employed 
as teachers in the public schools during the year” was 9,670. It is evident that these 
figures are for the period beginning with the first day of the annual session 1885-86 
and ending with the last. And this fact we imagine is what is told by the statistics 
we have just given in the table. ‘They show the change during the school year but 
say nothing about the change in the personnel between the last day or week of the 
preceding school year and the first day or week of the school year under consid- 
eration. 
Suppose we were to consider every place in a system of public schools to have be- 
come vacant before the first day of a new school year. Then we might ask, ‘‘ How 
many of last year’s teachers have been reémployed ?” and if this inquiry could be an- 
swered we would be able to come to a conclusion as to the permanence of the force 
as shown by the proportion that one year has of: the teachers of the preceding year. 
This would be a far more accurate way of estimating permanency than the rather rough 
and ready process of comparing the number of places with the number of different 
teachers employed during the year as we have done to show the changes occurring 
during the year. There will be an opportunity to investigate the changes that occur 
from session to session when speaking of the ‘‘summer and winter session” of the 
New England States. 
We thonght at one time that the Rhode Island report—very full and encouraging 
on the points under consideration—made the distinction expressed in the foregoin; 
aragraph. That report gives the ‘‘number of changes in teachers from report 0} 
teat year.” But in turning to page 96 of the report for 1883 we find that “ nearly one- 
third of the whole number (of teachers) in the State have changed their location dur- 
ing the year,” the one-third being the 346 “changes in teachers from report of last 
year.” '‘If we drop out of our calculation,” the school commissioner continues, “the 
towns where the town system prevails, we find that nearly one-half of the teachers 
in the remaining towns where the district system holds, are changed during the year.” 
Subject to correction, then, let us take the actual number of changes occurring in 
Rhode Island and place the ratio they bear to the number of teachers necessary to 
supply the schools, by the side of the Rhode Island column of Tabulation G, which 
also is estimated on the number necessary to supply the schools.

We would attribute the discrepancy between the two columns to the omissions we 
have mentioned in discussing Tabulation G. % 
The division into two groups which has been justified in the foregoing is still pos- 
‘sible in the table under discussion. In Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island 
the number of teachers employed to each one hundred places is much nearer and 
lower than in the other three States of the geographical section under consideration, 
although New Hampshire is much nearer the southern group than the northern. 
But Connecticut is computed on the basis of school-rooms or departments as are the 
computations for all the New England States except Massachusetts and Rhode Island. 
It must not be forgotten that there are two bases of calculation in Tabulation G, 
and that it is far more adapted to permit the comparison of the figures forthe differ- 
ent years in the same State than the figures for the same year of the different States. 
The statistics of Ohio have been introduced to compare with those of Massachu- 
setts and Rhode Island, while the statistics of Wisconsin serve the same purpose for 
New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Vermont. Wisconsin is preéminently an agricul- 
tural State, and in 1880 Ohio was undoubtedly in the same category, over half of her’, 
population ‘having an occupation,” being on farms, 
It is not necessary to say that the number of different teachers to a place is rapidly 
growing less. Massachusetts leads in this respect; but it must be borne in mind 
that the number of school-rooms has been used in the case of Connecticut, though 
undoubtedly it is too small; for in 1874, 1878, and 1881, periods for which the ‘‘num- 
ber required to teach the schools” is at hand, there were only 136, 127, and 121 
teachers to each hundred places. If the diminishing tendency shown by these figures

has been maintain Connectient would perhaps be on an equality with Massachusetts 
in respect to the relation which the different number of teachers bears to the number 
required to teach the schools. r 
If the basis of calculation for Vermont may be trusted, the table shows but little 
‘sign of advancement for that State. As we have before remarked, an examination of 
. lithograph map 27 of the last census shows Vermont to have a population almost 
srithout those centers of concentration which are comparatively numerous in thé 
southern part of New Hampshire and of Maine, the other less densely populated 
States of New England. 
SUMMER AND WINTER SESSIONS OF NEW ENGLAND.    
To the student of the political institutions of New England who had failed to dis- 
tinguish between a New England “town” and ‘‘a collection of houses,” the peculiar 
phraseology in this respect of the States of that section would be misleading; no less 
misleading to the uninitiated is their use of the term ‘school year,” as used in the past. 
Every twelve months saw two or more school terms in these States, and it is doubt- 
ful whether their ‘annual report,” which covers the period called a school year in 
other sections of the Union, isnot more properly to be viewed as representing to all in- 
tents and purposes what is covered by the s called biennial report of several States, 
and whether in trying to treat the statistics of two terms as the statistics of a single 
continuous period, things have been put together in these annual reports which should 
have been kept apart. In two States, however, this has not been done; these are 
Maine-and Connecticut, whose statistics therefore will enable us to examine into the 
change that has taken place at the date when one consecutive school period is ended 
by the vacation that intervenes before the beginning of another period of school. 
In Tabulation G we have compared the different number of teachers with the 
places for them. We will now compare the number of different women employed as 
teachers during each term with the whole number of different persons—men and 
womens;employed during that term.

For Maine the number of teachers employed during the summer as well as during 
the winter term is not at hand. But it is possible to find the relation which the num- 
ber of women in the summer corps bears to the number of women in the winter corps.

It is quité observable that in Connecticut the number ‘of men employed is steadily 
retrograding, while the continuity of service is still more rapidly advancing. 
The converse of this is shown by the statistics of Maine. There we find that until 
lately the percentage of women in the winter corps has been quite uniform, while 
-the number of wowen in the summer corps has been equally uniform and nearly 
twice as large the number employed in winter. It must be remembered in the 
case of Maine that this is the minimum change that occurred during the year, it does 
not necessarily follow because there is a female teacherin a school for the winter term, 
and a female teacher in the same schgol for the summer term, that this statistically one 
teacher is the same woman. 
These facts while helping out the showing of Tabulation G, lead us to inquire what

    i THE TEACHING FORCE OF NEW ENGLAND. ; 
' PROPORTION OF WOMEN IN THE TEACHING CORPS. 
‘ 
Not only did the calendar year in New England see two distinct scholastic periods, 
but each period saw a scholastic revolution, a sort of educational somersault’. In 
winter the larger pupils attended school and were taught by young men; in summer 
the little children attended and were taught by young women. The change, as far 
as it was achange in sex, is readily seen from the following percentages of women in 
each corps for 1858 + Winter. Summer.

  “Previous to twenty years ago,” says the State superintendent of Maine in 1878, in 
discussing the change in the character of the attendance at the schools, ‘it was the 
almost universal practice. in the country districts at least, for young men and women 
to attend school [in winter] till their majority; now they are rarely found in them 
after they are sixteen or seventeen years of age. Of this change .* * ™ the fol-

“One of the most frequent causes for the change'of teachers,” says the State:super- 
intendent of Maine in 1866, “is to be found in the long-cherished idea-that: there 
must be a male teacher for the winter and a female teacher for the summer. This. 
idea doubtless originated in the olden days of our New England life, when the educa- 
tion of the females had received but little attention and when needlework and knit- 
ting were deemed indispensable qualifications to be acquired in the schoolroom, and 
the literary attainments of the mistress were not expected to go much beyond the 
ability to manage the little pupils in reading (for the larger ones were not expected 
to be present) and hear them read and spell.” 
The Rev. Birdsey G. Northrop, in 1863, while agent of the Massachusetts Board of 
Education, speaks incidentally of this matter thus: ‘In chemistry, in the arts and ag- 
riculture, experiments, however expensjye, are often necessary and useful. Perse- 
vering trials and repeated failures Usually precedé, and sometimes suggest valuable 
inyentions. But of all experimenting, the most needless, costly, and fruitless, and 
yet the most common, isthe practice of placing a new hand at the wheel, annually 
or even twice a year, in our school houses. * * * And yet not a few prudential 
agents in our districts, from mere whim, or pique, or more often from nepotism, 
practice a system of change in teachers which introduces confusion, waste, weak- 
ness, discouragement, and often retrogression, in the place of system, economy, effi- 
ciency, and progress. * * * There are still towns which retain the old system of 
semiannual changes, male teachers in the winter and female in the summer, and 
even each successive summer and winter, in some towns, the same teachers are seldom 
reémployed. In such placesI find the schools in the lowest condition, with no uni- 
form methods, or well-arranged plan consistently and persistently sustained. * * * 
It often requires nearly a term to initiate a new teacher into the policy of the school 
committee who officially direct his course. * * * It has long been a conceded point 
among successful teachers that a second term in the same school is worth atleast [to 
the pupil] one-third more than the first. The schoolroom is the most unfortunate 
place for those experiments which ‘rotation in office,’ must here involve—entailing 
a dead loss of more than 30 per cent. of the expenditures made for the schools. * * * 
Many towns seem, from precedent, to take it for granted that there is a necessity 
for male teachers in the winter, and therefore of semiannual changes, as they can 
not afford to continue maies in the summer. This was formerly the general practice 
throughout the State.” ?

‘Speaking of the ‘ Duration of Schools,” the superintendent of Vermont in his report for 1867, says: ‘Taking all these facts together, then, it will appear that in a large proportion of the schools the prevalent custom must be to secure the services of a teacher to sustain a school for two and one-half months, and then at the close of that term to allow a vacation of three and one-half months, after which another teacher is engaged and a school supported for another term of two and one-half mouths, to which succeeds another vacation of three and one-half months.” 2In an account given of a ‘common school from 1801 to 183!,” by “a teacher,” in the October, 1831, number of the American Annals of Education, we tind it. recorded thet * male teachers have been uniformly employed (for the school] in winter and females in summer. ‘The instructors haye usually eb '

Where the distinction between the winter teaching corps and those employed in 
summer has been continued down to recent years as in Maine and Connecticut, the 
work of the investigator is probably reliable. But in the other New England 
States, as this distinction was discontinued, as far as the annual reports show at 
various dates before 1870, the statistics are not above question. In Connecticut, for 
instance, in 1865 the male teachers formed 31 per cent. of the winter corps, but only 
5 per cent. of the summer corps; yet by adding the number of male teachers em- 
ployed jn summer to the number employed in winter it will be found that the men 
‘ormed 20 per cent. of the two corps. Taking 1880, 28 per cent. of the winter corps of 
the same State were men, but of the summer corps only 14 per cent. To add the two 
corps and compute the percentage of men on that base is to bring out strongly the 
weak point of an average. 4 
Under such Circumstances comment on the table is somewhat hazardous, yet it is 
pee enough that the per cent. of women has been increasing in Rhode Island, 
aine, and Connecticut. Inthe late comprehensive report of ihe secretary of the 
State Board of Education of Connecticut the principal of the normal school of Con- 
necticut notes that about 1883 an extraordinary increase occurred in the enrollment 
ofthat school which he admits he can not explain. It is noticeable that just before 
‘this ‘date Tabulation J shows a rapid advance for Connecticut in the number of 
been changed every season, but sometimes they have been continued two successive simmers or 
winters. strong prejudice has always existed against employing the samé instructor more than 
once or twice in the same district. ‘This prejudice has yielded in one instance so far that an instructor 
who had taught two successive winters twenty-five years before was employed another season. I 
have not been able to ascertain the exact number of different instructors who have been engaged in 
the school during the last thirty years; but I distinctly recollect thirty-seven. Many of them, both 
males and females, were from sixteen to eighteen years of age, and a few over twenty-one. 
  and expert testimony that not very long ago the |

fvomen employed, and that this was preceded by a period of slight depression, a period 
_ covering the ‘‘ hard times” that marked the last half of the seventies. In Maine the 
same phenomena appears, and also, though to a less extent, in Rhode Island, New 
Hampshire, and Vermont. 
Had we extended our inquiry into the elements of the teaching of New England, — 
back for 20 years the constantly increasing proportion of women in the winter corps 
would have been shown still more clearly. In Massachusetts, for instance, 76 per 
cent. of the different teachers employed in the public schools were females as early 
a3 1858. Statistics of the two coeducating normal schools of this State confirm the 
tendency of the teaching corps to become femininized, as is shown by the following 
statistics.

When it is remembered what a determined advocate of women for teachers the 
first secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education was, and that in all proba- ~ 
bility it was through his determined attitude that the first normal school—that orig- 
inally at Lexington—was devoted to the training of women’ for teaching, comment 
on the large percentage of women in the teaching corps of Massachusetts would seem 
to be unnecessary, provided always that the figures obtained by iumping the statis- 
ties of the winter and summer sessions may be trusted. ‘The secretary of the Massa- 
chusetts Board of Education, however, while corroborating the high percentage of 
women in the teaching corps, claims in 1875 that it is an increase that is due to the, 
civil war, the cause assigned by the French commission to the Centennial in their re- 
port to the minister of public instruction. The secretary says: 
“The demand for young men during the war of the rebellion and the higher re- 
wards for labor of all kinds after it, did much to change the old custom [of chan, 
of teachers for winter and summer]. * * * The school committees of some of the, 
towns, from motives of economy, and on account of the difficulty of procuring male

  ‘ 
teachers as well, cautiously entered upon the plan of hiring teachers for longer periods, 
The results were, unexpectedly to many, satisfactory, and other towns followed the 
lead, until the custom bid fair to become universal.” | ; 
In an earlier report (the thirty-second) he says: Soa i 
“It is probably true that the willingness of women to accept lower wages has in- 
ittees to engage their services more exclusively, but it by no 
the standard of true education is not as high now as in former 
times.” The apology for employing women would not be necessary nowadays, but 
the ‘willingness of women to accept lower wages” brings us to the very important 
question of ‘ 
SALARIES. | 
In whatever way the synchroneity of increase in the number of women employed 
to teach in the public schools and the permanence of their personnel may be related 
it is improbable that the relation is one of cause and effect. We believe that in no 
State are married women employed as teachers, nor have we any statistics that go 
to show that female teachers haye ceased to marry. In their forty-seventh report, 
the Massachusetts Board of Education touch upon this subject in the following terms: 
“Tn our public schools the corps of teachers is subject to rapid changes. A very 
large per cent. of our teachers are young women, and many of these after a fair time 
of service leave school to become heads of families.” , 1 
And yet it is in Massachusetts that the propaganda for female teachers was first, 
begun and whose force was the most rapidly changed. If it be contended that 
between the ages of beginning school teaching and married life there elapses a period 
which, in cca aee with the temporary character of the service of men who engage 
in teaching, may be called long, it must be admitted that there may be truth in the 
contention; but it will be observed that the board speak of the “rapid changes ? 
tnat take place in the teaching corps. How far the law, if demanding mental ma- 
turity and more years on the part of the teacher, would abridge this period of service, 
must be left to a future occasion, how far a fairer salary might induce the teacher to 
postions her wedding day is a complicated problem, to solve which we find ourselves 
unequal. F i 
But it is quite possible, indeed, that the pay which is too'meager to hold men may 
be, in the case of women, an inducement to remain. Assuming such to be the case, 
as the Massachusetts authorities just quoted have, we are then obliged to look to the 
small pay as the real cause of the increase of the female element of the teaching 
corps. In the following table the average salaries paid by the New England States 
since 1866 are laid before the reader.

Of the 365 days of which the year is composed, 180 to 200 are, or ought to be, scho- 
lastic facts to the pupil; while 365 are economical facts to the professional teacher. 
It is somewhat difficult to compute with exactness the salary annually received by 
the teacher when the ayerage salary is given for a ‘‘month” and the average dura- 
Assuming, however, that the term ‘‘ days” means 
school days, of which there are five to the week, and that a “month” means four

Applying this hypothesis to the figures as given for Maine it will be found that in 
1866 the amount of money earned daily dtiring the 100 days~of 'session,' winter and

Now salaries, of the kind shown in the table, render teaching as a profession impossi-* 
ble. A profession that is not continuous or that does not afford its practitioners 
large piofit for occasional service, is scarcely to be looked upon as a profession. 1t 399

is equally true that the mean or average salary is above that actually received by 
the majority of teachers. If it be urged that the teacher has much of the year to 
work at something else such a proposition would seem to say that the teacher should 
have either two vocations or a vocation and an ayocation. | ‘ 
As the women in the teaching corps are steadily gaining on the men in States where 
they lave not long formed 80 to 90 per cent. of the teaching force, and as married 
women are disqualified in practice as teachers, the question arises whether the female 
teacher follows her calling as a yocation or, as @ means of support until her domestic 
engagements relieve her of the necessity of working for herself. The probability, of 
course, is that teaching in the great majority of cases is engaged in as a temporary. 
expedient. Were the age of the teacher and the duration of her service recorded and 
published this probability might become a mathematical certainty. 
Comparing the i i i "4s true these “average monthly salaries” are means between wide extremes, put it 
      
   
   
figures of tabulation M with the salaries given in manufacturing 
establishments up to the date of the last United States census, we find in the case 0: 
women that the teachers of Rhode Island and the women weavers of Fitchburg, 
Mass., and Dover, Me., receive about the same, and it will be noted that Rhode. 
Tsland has stood in the past ahead even of Massachusetts, in respect to the pa: of 
women teachers. Common laborers of cotton and woolen mills receive from 1 to 
$1.25 or more for each of 6 days of work, which when reduced to the basis of 
365 days of existence in the year would be 86 cents to $1.07. It must be remembered 
that we are not considering the amount.of work done to earn the means of living, 
the object of a profession, but the remuneration derived from the discharge of pro- 
fessional duties, in order to support life during 365 days. Though the work of the 
woolen mill is neither heavy or hard, so say their superintendents, the operatives 
work 10 hours. are not sure but the professional teacher works quite as long 
during the day, if not for so many days. { 
In bringing this statistical analysis to an end, we can not forbear to still further 
ask the attention of the reader to one of its indications. Beginning with 1876 or 
1877 a decline in the average salary of both men and women began reaching its 
ultimate in 1840. Thisis shown far better by ‘Pabulation L than by Tabulation M, in 
which the longer duration of the session fn 1880 compensates in some cases for the 
decrease in the average monthly pay. 
‘Although convinced that this is an excellent illustration of the remark made on & 
previous page that school affairs ebb and flow with public economy we doubted the 
advisability of discussing the point with the statistics of only a single section of the 
Union before us, to say nothing of the intrinsic difficulties of the attempt. In 
examining the records of the Peabody education fund for the matter used in compil- 
ing the work Peni in Chapter XIII, we were fortunate enough to find the     
   
agent of the Peabody fund saying for the Southern States and Superintendent 
Dickinson for Massachusetts just what we should have liked to have said for New 
England. It almost seems as if Dr. Sears had written a commentary on this indica- 
tion of our table. In his twelfth report (October 2, 1878) he observes: 
«The year just brought to a close has been one of unusual pecuniary embarrassment 
to all the schools of the South, While every pranch of the department of education 
has been affected by it, that relating to the employment of teachers and public officers 
has suffered most. Cheapening the labors of the men on whom the vitality of the 
system depends is a more dangerous experiment than is enerally supposed. With-. 
out calling in question the necessity of reducing public expenses, our most consider- 
ate educators have sometimes felt that, in discriminating against the schools, the 
public authorities have seemed to prefer immediate material prosperity to the future 
well-being of society.” ( r 
In his report dated January, 1879, Secretary Dickinson, of Massachusetts, ex- 
presses himself thus on this topic: ‘The economical spirit that has taken possession 
of the people has led them to reduce appropriations for the schools, and in some cases 
to their great injury. Not only has the time of the schools, in many towns, been 
shortened and the salaries of the teachers been cut down, but in many cases new and 
cheaper teachers have been substituted for those of experience and skill. This change 
will be likely to inflict an immediate injury upon the schools by the employment of 
inferior teachers, and it will have a tendency to produce a permanent one by distour- 
aging the best talent from ever entering the profession.” * 
"An examination of Tabulation I, shows a change that appears to follow, that is as 
far as the dates and statistics show, closely on the increase in pay that began after 
the depression in 1880, Although hardly noticeable in Massachusetts, the increase 
in the percentage of women in the teaching corps of New England is decided after 
1881 or 1882, and continuous. © 
It is not the province of this chapter to explain these facts; our purpose here has 
been to exhibit conditions rather than to explain them, and we now turn to our 
sphere—the training of persons for teachers and the training of teachers. _

BEGINNERS. 
S| characteristics of the New Bngland States, the condition of their teaching force 
since 1866 or 1870 asto the change that has annually occurred in the personnel, its 
“average salary,” and the proportion of women in it. We have made no attemptto 
disguise the incompleteness of our figures and have refrained from argument, ‘con- 
tenting ourselves with collating and analyzing. In brief, our object has been to 
place before the reader as best we can, the change that has annually occurred in the 
teaching force and two phenomena that may be supposed to influence it, 
But a new teacher is not necessarily a person unexperienced in the art of teachin, 
and thus ‘changes in the teaching force” and “ beginners in teaching” do no 
mean the same thing exactly. Agent Northrop, of Massachusetts, and other high 
educational officials complain of the evils resulting from annually or semiannually 
placing a new teacher over the same school, although this new teacher may have 
‘gained experience in other schools. Butif the new teacher be not only new to the 
particular school she is about to teach, but also new to her business, the evils of 
beginning are intensified for she is in every sense a beginner. It is the purpose of 
the normal school to minimize the évil by training persons im the theory and practice 
of teaching who shall fillthe yacancies in the corps, which, from an ideal point of 
view, are caused by the natural increase of schools or of the departments of schools, 
and by death, superannuation, or dismissal. 
The question arises whether a graduate of a normal school should We considered a 
beginner. This question is answered in the affirmative by the State school com- 
missioner of Rhode Island. And we shall follow him in his classification ; for in his 
reports since 1881 the character of the teaching force has been most thoroughly pre- 
sented. In the foregoing we have attemptéd to show, after briefly noting several social

Outside of New England, four States present the number of beginners, but their 
statistics have not been included in the tabulation as the discussion of their statistics 
must be postponed to another occasion. Regarding Vermont, it may be said that 
the percentages from 1867 to and including 1870 seem due to some process of enum- 
erating teachers or beginners different from that used after 1870. 
In Connecticut down to 1877 the percentages shrink rapidly, but after that down 
to 1885 they fluctuate, indeed, yet within narrow limits. With 1805 the lowest per- 
centage is reached and is maintained in the following years, The decrease in Maine, 
New Hampshire, and Rhode Island has been small.

Goo |X EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. ‘ 
   Horace Mann says in one of his educational addresses, “I have heard that distin- 
mished surgeon, Dr. J.C. Warren of Boston, relate the foliowing anecdote which 
happened to him in London. Being invited to witness very difficult operation upon 
the human eye, by a celebrate English oeulist, he was so struck by the skill and 
geience which were exhibited by the operator, that he sought a private interview 
with him to inquire by what means he had become so accomplished a master of his 
art. ‘Sir, said the oculist, ‘I spoiled a hatful of eyes to learn it.’” 
It might be readily assumed that the public, which oa such apprehension 
when children instructed in a “ practice school” by & ovice of the normal school 
proper, though orking under skilled direction, would be still more apprehensive as 
+o the results of the activity of a novice with no supervision at all, and that- public 
authorities would, in view of public sentiment, provide for the training of efficient 
teachers to supply the annual vacancies. In point of fact, whether due to public senti- 
ment or to common sense, training schools for this purpose have been established in 
every State with but few exceptions. But the supply of normal graduates even if 
equal to the de and for them is certainly not equal to the number of beginners. 
‘Before showing this by the tabulation which follows, we beg to quote as to this 
subject of supply and demand from an address read before the State Teachers’ Asso- 
ciation of New Hampshire which though not written py the State superintendent of 
that State was printed by that officer as a part of his “ official” report for 1830, Tes- 
timony from other New England and outside of New England States could be found 
to substantiate the author’s observation. r 
«J once knew a prudential committee of good standing in the community to com- 
mence their duties with substantially the following resolutions: 
«<Whereas, the previous committee ran the school 80 many weeks for so many 
dollars; and whereas we are smarter than they— 3.53 
«6 Resolved, That we will have more weeks of school for less money. 
«Resolved, Secondly, that the wages of the teachers be reduced ; thirdly, that the 
former experienced teachers may retain their situations if they choose, at the reduced 
prices ;'but it they leave, we can find enough more who will be glad to occupy their 
laces.’ 4 
oe Some of the teachers remained, others * * * Jeft, and at the close of the year 
the committee reported a handsome surplus in the treasury and were triumphantly 
reélected.  * ee f 
« We are told that we must learn that the law of supply and demand applies to 
teachers as well as to other commodities. We do not object, if quality is to be duly 
regarded. * A good article of commerce, unappreciated, is_ withdrawn fromm 
market, and its manufacture stopped. May the public complain if a similar result 
obtain with te: chers? 
| «We do complain of that condition of things which compels the teacher, who has 
spent years of time and hundreds of dollars at college or normal school, to give his 
or her services for one-half or two-thirds of a just equivalent because some inexperi- 
enced and uneducated boy or girl can afford, and is willing, to keep the school at 
even 4 less price. ‘There are undoubtedly more persons who would like to replenish 
their scanty purses by a prief reign in the district schoolhouse the ensuing winter 
than there will be schools in the State ; but were none but well qualified instructors 
to be ian 8 our schools this coming winter, many @ pile of wood would be un- 
burned, many a schoolhouse unoccupied save by the wind and snows that sweep over 
our hills, many a district treasury unexhausted, and many a committee reélected.” 
“The State,” says the State superintendent of Maine, from a somewhat different 
if not antagonistic point of view, ‘has established a public school system, * Pett 
imposes taxation for school purposes, requires the expenditure annually of the moneys 
thus raised, but has signally neglected to provide for any sufficient agency in secur- 
ing that body of school-room workers by whom alone the results aimed for can be 
fully attained.” Though in a subsequent report, which discusses things as they 
were over ten years ago, not as they are now, it will be remembered, he continues 
thus: “Nearly 100 pupils graduated from the two normal schools of the State dur- 
ing the past year. Why, then, no greater increase in the number in the schools? 
Some of the recent graduates can nob find positions since the great reduction in wages 
made by some [school] agents during the past season. Agents have in many cases 
refused to give these graduates four dollars per week, and have hired girls of six- 
teen for three dollars, who were incompetent and whose influence on the pupils was 
pad so far as intellectual growth is concernéed.? Thirty-four of the graduates of our 
normal schools haye gone out of the State to take positions as teachers in other 
States. They have each taught more than two years in the schools of the State,

‘A more patticular and very influential reason for this indifference of high-school

have been content to take candidates immediately from the high school.” i

In considering the above table (O) the intelligence of the reader is immediately 
challenged by the word “‘ graduate,” which is the title of one of the two columns for 
each State. It will immediately occur to him that the normal course of two or three 
years, like courses of several years in other institutions, is subject to a diminishing 
process that leaves about half of the pupils who entered three years before to gradu- 
ate. And from this he will be led to consider whether it is quite accurate to place 
the two columns of the table in juxtaposition, since the graduates do not represent 
the number having received some training for teaching. 
To such doubts it may be replied that the cours» of three years would not have 
been organized had it not been deemed essential for the preparation of the pupil for 
his vocation, and that any pupil possessing before entering the school a portion of 
the knowledge taught in it would infallibly possess what was taught in the first two 
years rather than the knowledge inculcated in the last and graduating year. Indeed, 
it is very obvious that more may be said against the column of graduates from the 
other side. All the graduates do not teach. t 
The increase in the percentage of graduates in the case of Maine and of Connecticut 
is to be ascribed more to the diminution in the number of different teachers em- 
ployed than to any. extra efforts to supply the vacancies that annually occur with 
trained. persons; it being understood, of course, that the number of different persons 
employed as teachers is used as the divisor and the number of graduate as the divi- 
dend in obtaining the percentages of the table. i 
In England, where the vast majority of teachers are men, the ‘ waste” in the 
teaching force is computed to be about 6 per cent.; if the beginners be taken as in- 
dicating the ‘‘ waste” in the New England corps it will almost double and treble 
the annual loss in England, It is but too apparent how inadequate the present num- 
bor of normal schools are to meet the demands—from a theoretical standpoint—upon 
them. 
So important is the relation between the number of beginners and the number of 
graduates from the normal schools, that we present the matter in another form. In

  Thus it appears that for every one hundred graduates the normal schools had sent 
forth from their halls since they were opened fo students down to 1888 there were . 
during the five years 1884 to 188 thirty beginners employed. © 
Speaking on the subject of the annual need of trained persons to teach the schools 
the superintendent of Maine observes in his 1877 report: | 
«The schools of Maine need to-day qualified trained teachers. This is the greatest 
want. * * * .There are 6,000 teachers in the schools of the State. The average 
time of service is four years. Fifteen hundred teachers are needed each year. More 
than 1,000 were employed for the first time last year. They were in part young girls 
from fourteen to seventeen, but with little knowledge of elementary studies; with 
absolutely no knowledge of the. principles or methods of good teaching. Another 
part ofthe thousand were young men or boys in preparation for college or a profes- 
sion, with some slight smattering of Latin, but with no real knowledge of the ele- 
mentary studies and not the shadow of knowledge, of either the nature of the sub- 
ects on which they were supposed to work, or the proper methods of such work. A 
‘third class is composed of young men or boys, who unable to succeed in any other 
business have sought refuge from starvation in the schools. A few of the thousands 
are trained eashare young men and young women, who with an appreciation of the 
responsibility and importance of the work haye sought by reading, by study, in the 
professional school or elsewhere, to fit themselves for their work.” 
Dr. Sears, ex-superintendent of Massachusetts and ex-president of Brown Uni- 
versity, in his twelfth report to the trustees of the Peabody Education fund speaks 
quite pointedly,as to the necessity of professional training, saying : 
“The objection has been made to normal schools, that knowledge is what the 
teacher needs, and that our literary institutions furnish it best. This is only half 
of what the teacher needs, and much the easiev half. You will find twenty who have 
this qualification, where you find one who knows how to teach and govern. This 
assertion is made not from a theoretical point of view, but from experience and obser- 
vation. I was for some years connected with the public schools of Massachusetts. 
School boards who had formerly employed college graduates, but more recently grad- 
uates of the State normal schools, could not be induced to appoint as @ teacher a 
young man just from college, without a normal training.’ This is the more remark- 
able as the members of the board were themselves generally college graduates. It 
was found by the that a knowledge of what is commonly taught in learned schools 
     
js not all that the teacher needs. He must know how to enter into the hidden re- 
cesses of the youthful mind, and from that point work outward and upward.” 
“The more I visit schools’ and observe their methods and results,” says Ex-Super- 
intendent Northrop, of Connecticut, while State agent of Massachusetts, ‘the 
stronger is my conviction of the necessity and usefulness of normal schools. My 
observations in the schools and among the people assure me that our Massachusetts 
normal schools have widely diffused better ideas of education and awakened in- 
creased popular interest in the cause of public instruction. They have greatly ele- 
vated the standard of qualification for: teaching, both among teachers and in the 
popular estimate. ‘The normal graduates as a general fact have shown greater thor- 
oughness and skill in teaching, more system in arrangement of studies and in the 
programme of daily duties, more enthusiasm in their work and devotion to the pro- 
fession.” (As quoted by the State superintendent of Maine in. 1867.) 
“The good influence of the normal schools,” says the Forty-seventh Massachusetts 
Report, ‘in creating a correct public sentiment with reference to popular education, 
and to the administration of the schools in all their forms of work, can hardly be © 
overestimated, The revival of the school spirit and the reform of our methods of 
school teaching both owe their origin to influences produced by the normal school. 
“Great pains have peen taken to collect information concerning the success of 
j 
:  
-P-A-G-E-407
   
  normal teachers. The returns prove what reasor. would predict, that there is the 
‘same-difference between trained ‘and untrained teachers as there is between the 
trained and untrained in all other occupations and professions.” 
, 4 DO THE GRADUATES TEACH? 
The number of graduates from the normal schools falling so far short of the (the- 
oretically speaking) demand for them we are brought to a difficult inquiry which 
has on several occasions caused legislative investigations, that is to say, Do the grad- 
uates teach? 
Beginning with the year 1874 the forms of inquiry sent out by this Office contained 
the following requests: ‘‘ Number of graduates for the year” and. ‘‘ Number of these 
teaching. ” 
In Tabalation P we have compiled the answers made by the principalsof State and 
city normal schools to these inquiries. , We will not trouble the reader with the ‘pre- 
cautions taken to prevent error except so far as to assure him that, in’ the case of 
Maine for example, the 93 per cent. who engaged in teaching in 1874 are 93.per cent. 
of the persons who were in institutions which are represented in both columns. For 
suppose a school reports its graduates and neglects to report the number of them who’ 
engage in teaching, as frequently happens, the per cent. of persons teaching would 
1 then 
report. : | 
' A -woid, however, as to the propriety of finding what percent. the graduates are of 
the whole enrolment’at the school. It may be said that the attendance from year to 
year of several schools of different kinds and sizes is not a conStant quantity; and 
this being admitted it may be further claimed that the averages are meaningless. If, 
however, it be considered that the expression ‘65 per cent. enrolled as applied to a 
system of schools” is the usual way of telling that 35 per cent. of the school popu- 
lation were not enrolled it will bé readily recognized that when we say in the 
table that 9 per cent. have graduated, we imply that 91 per cent. have not, presuma- 
ply, finished their studies, and if in the next year only 6 per cent. graduate and the 
next 10 and so on, we may arrive at an approximately close idea of the per cent. 
that graduates by running the eye down the m0 0. The absence of statistics for 1883 is caused by a change in the date of our 
| 
Connecticut had one State normal school from 1850 to 1888. _Confining our attention 
to the series of years embraced by the table we find that 22 per cent. of the enrol- 
ment of this school from 1874 to 1888 were graduated, according to the figures given 
in the State superintendent’s report for 1883-89. | Perhaps the best way to show that 
about a fifth of those who enter upon a course at @ normal school remain to graduate, 
as Tabulation P seems to show, is to quote from the results of the very elaborate in- 
vestigation prosecuted by President Gray of the St. Cloud Normal School, acting for 
the committee appointed by the National ag oatioual: Association, a report that has 
arrived too recently to enable its results to bé' used here excépt incidentally. The 
question asked of forty-nine normal schools, eight of which are city schools, was 
“What per cent. of your students enrolled in the pedagogical course graduates?” 
“Tn eighteen [State] schools which seemed to have understood the question alike 
the answers average 20 per cent. In addition to poles city training schools give an 
average of 95 per cent., though in these schools the enrolment is sometimes as low 
as six pupils.” |

But how long do they teach? ‘In France,” says the French education commission 
to the Centennial Exposition,' “a person enters upon the career of teaching with the 
view of creating for himself a stable and permanent position. Those who abandon 
it before obtaining their retiring pension are theexception, * * * Itis altogether 
different in the United States. The profession of teaching seems to be a sort of stop- 
ping place where the young woman waits for an establishment suited to her tastes, 
and the young man for a more lucrative position. For many young people, this transi- 
tory profession simply furnishes the means of continuing their studies. Few male 
teachers remain more than five years in the service ; and if the lady teachers remain 
longer, it is not to be forgotten that marriage is usually the end of their desires, and 
that, once married, they almost always resign their posi ns.” 
“©The whole number of graduates from the opening in 1871 to the present writing, 
December, 1878, is 201,” says the superintendent of Rhode Island. _‘‘ Upwards of 95 
per cent. of these have taught sinee graduation. One hundred and thirty of the num- 
ber graduated are now teaching and have been teaching, many of them continuously, 
since their separation from the school on having completed their course. Though it 
has been the policy of Providence and Newport to employ as teachers the graduates 
of their posneguys high schools, and though vacancies oceur in less porportion in 
cities than elsewhere, yet twenty graduates of this school have received permanent 
appointments in the-city of Providence; six have received appointments in the 
schools of Newport; ten haye taught or are now teaching in high schools, and eight 
have been employed as teachers in normal schools.” \ 
In New Hampshire it was found that “ the students have the character of teachers 
before entering the school, that they continue to teach with increased interest in the 
‘work after leaving it, that the graduates have already returned to the State (third 
year of school’s istence) one week of teaching to one and one-third weeks’ instruc- 
tion received in the school, and from their present address we are assured that the 
school has already sent nearly one hundred active and educated teachers into differ- 
ent parts of the State, and that at least 100 more students not graduated are occa- 
sionally thus employed within the limits of New Hampshire.” 
“About 95 per cent. of normal graduates teach after leaving the normal schools, 
and on the ented about five years,” says the secretary of the Massachusetts Board 
of Education. Over 90 per cent. teach in Massachusetts. ‘These teachers scattered 
over the Commonwealth have done much towards introducing improved methods of 
teaching and towards recommending the public schools to public favor. The quality 
of primary teaching-has rapidly improved during the last few years. There is now 
a growing inclination to place the best trained teachers over the primary schools. 
These things are largely due to the effect normal schools have produced through 
their graduates in leading superintendents and school committees to magnify the 
importance of a instruction.”    
   
   
     
    
         
     
        
       
    
   
     
         
        
     
  
     
             
   
       : THE NON-GRADUATES. 
        
         
          
      
       The question as to what becomes of the pupils at the normal schools, that do not 
graduate is an important one in a double sense; for it may be asked, since they form 
by far the largest part of the attendance during a series of years, what return do 
they render the State by teaching in its schools, while, if they do engagé in teaching, 
what is the value of their services for the advancement of the schools they teach, and, 
indirectly, for the advancement of the reputation of the normal schools from which 
they came. { 
As to the valu 
the reputation of the performances in the public schools of the non-graduates to 
f the normal schools they have attended, several very plain state- 
ments are to-be found in the State reports of the New England States, several of 
which are now reproduced. _ 
In 1877 the board of trustees of the Rhode Island Normal School say: ‘In the 
interests both of the normal school and of the town schools of the State, the trustees 
school is not necessarily to have received its diploma, or to have become qualified as 
ateacher. When school authorities are asked to engage the services of persons com- 
mendin, thomnelves on the ground of having been for a time a pupil of the normal 
school, Sut who have not received its diploma, it woald be well to bear in mind that 
such a profession may be, in fact, a confession of incompetency. * * * Asa result 
of the severe winnowing process to which the school is subjected, preparatory to the

entrance of classes upon the senior year, a considerable number of pupils fail to © 
complete the school course.” In a report several years later the principal of the 
normal schools says that, while making a tour of the State, he found many of these 
non-graduates teaching in rural schools. : 
We find complaint made of the injury the poor work of the non-g: 
doing to the school both in Maine and Massachusetts. In the twenty-si 
report of the board of education of the latter State occurs the following: 
“The board desire to make two observations to school committees. First, to those 
whose duty it is to employ teachers for their schools, Not infrequently individuals 
present themselves claiming to be qualified for the business of teaching, and, to 
strengthen the claim, state that they have been members of a normal school. They 
are employed and miserably fail in their work. The truth in many cases is that the 
individuals may have been connected witha normal school for a brief period, and 
have been found so unpromising as candidates for the vocation of teacher that they 
have been advised to break off their connection with the institution; or they may 
haye left voluntarily after so brief a connection that the school has not had time to 
develop the capacity or fitness of the person for teaching. In either case the reputa- 
tion of the school suffers. Judged by such results the normal school is condemned.” 
  IV.—PROFESSIONALITY. 
We have now in tnrn inquired into (1) the social conditions of the people from 
whom the New England teacher comes, and who are the raison d’étre of the wealth 
by which he is supported; (2) the conditions under which the New England téachin 
body as a professional corps labors as to change, sex, and pay; and (3) the annna 
demand for persons training for the business of teaching and the attempts made to 
meet that demand by the establishment of normal sohoale: We now enter upon the 
very delicate and immensely more difficult task of inquiring hurriedly as to the anount 
of information and mental training the New England teacher brings to his task. 
In quoting from the reports of the New England superintendents, as we shall in 
the sequel, we incur one danger especially. Froude, in his Life of Carlyle, tells us 
that that idealist, though a seyere critic of the poet Byron, was very apt to fall into 
a Carlylean mood when others less gifted than himself took the same liberty. The 
State superintendent. may be perfectly unconcerned about his constituents knowing 
how things as they are differ from what they ought to be, but he may also be extremely 
unwilling that his statements be compared with statements made by others who have 
not his idea of what things ought to be. 
If any section of this country can sustain with credit an examination of its school 
affairs that section is the one under review, and if in any section there has been less of 
that fatal optimism which, without making the worse appear the better reason, makes 
what is bad far less bad than it really is, that section is New England. If, then, in 
the following excerpts the reader should find statements which he has not seen in 
the reports of his own section he will be good enough not to draw a comparison until 
an investigation of his own geographical division of the country, carried on in the 
spirit of the New England superintendent, has convinced him that such a compari- 
son will not turn out to be odious. 
Against trusting the statements contained in the quotations it may be urged that 
. the fury of propaganda not infrequently causes the writer to. say ‘“ more than he really 
meant.” ‘To rectify this amiable weakness requires that qualitative analysis called 
“ reading between the lines,” whichit would be presumption in us to make, Any theory 
of an educational nature or any criticism of such a theory that asuperintendent may 
favor the public with we might venture to criticise, but his statements as to facts 
connected with the administration of his system must indeed be facts for us. 
’ . 
LITERARY ATTAINMENTS OF THE TEACHING CORPS OF THE NEW ENGLAND STATES, 
AS GIVEN IN THE STATE REPORTS, 1865-€5. 
In the State report of Maine for 1875, the superintendent remarks that : 
‘Public school teaching is not sufficiently attractive, nor, as a general thing, sufii- . 
ciently rewarded, to induce the best talent to spend time and money in obtaining a 
professional training for the service. Indeed, that class of young peoplé who are 
willing to become common school teachers are, as a rule, unable to provide for them- 
selves such training. It is clear that the State supports its normal schools and its 
public schools for the accomplishment of the same ends, 
«The normal schools of this, as the normal schools of other New England States, 
have a more direct effect upon the country schools than upon the schools of the cities. 
Haying gained what they can from schools in their own vicinity, young men and 
women possessing physical vigor and mental force and courage, and intent upon 
teaching, find their way, often in spite of serious obstacles, to the normal schools

  EDUCATION REPORT, 1888 89, 
country school, though small and its w: vie often very laborious, 
pecause necessarily ungraded, gives a freer field for the application of principles than 
the city school. — ey : | 
“The majority of those persons who wish to avail themselves of the advantages of 
normal instruction, that they may pecome teachers, are of a class that can not afford — 
opportunities for it are easy of access and convenient to their, 
homes. The number of pupils that attend the schools at Farmington and Castine 
from the counties where they are located, and the large proportion of that number. 
coming from the towns where the schools are located, attest to this! fact.” 
In the report of the general agent of the Massachusetts Board of Education, for 
1873-74, that officer speaks of “teachers? need of improvement,” in the following con- 
vineing fashion: 8 ‘ 
“Tn a recent visit to one of the wealthy towns in Essex County, I asked the chair- 
man of the school committees, who for more than 30 years has. taken an active intel- 
ligent interest in its schools, wherein the present schools of his town differed from 
those of 30 years ago. ‘In almost every respect,’ he said, ‘ there has been an im- 
ovement rr and we pay our teachers better wages’ ‘And has there been,’ 
asked, ‘a corresponding improvement in the teachers; are they better qualified 
for their work now than in former years, and are the results of their teaching more, 
satisfactory? ‘We have had,’ he replied, ‘for many years quite a number of very 
excellont teachers, who haye come to us with all the preparation for their work 
which the normal and high schools and academies could give them, though in some 
instances even the normal graduates have utterly failed of success 5 put we have had 
many poor teachers, who just from the grammar or district school, could pass a tol- 
erably good examination in the common branches of study, yet had no idea of any 
methods of teaching or of the proper work of the school room. On the whole, I do 
not think there has been a corresponding improvement in this respect.’ 
« What is true of this school is equally true of numerous other towns similarly. 
situated. Excellent and often very costly school buildings have been erected and 
thoroughly equipped; schools have been graded; courses of study, carefully and 
wisely matured, have been prepared, and not infrequently all this has been of little 
avail through lack of that which is more important than ‘either, or all of them com- 
pined, thoroughly qualified teachers. And if this is so in such towns as these, pre- 
senting so many inducements to attract the best teachers, and yet finding s0 many 
not properly qualified for their work, how must it be with numerous other towns i 
the State which can offer only greatly inferior wages and so get greatly inferior’ 
teachers? : 
Quoting ch Maine report for 1880, it appears that— i 
«There are few, I think, at all familiar with the condition and wants of our schools 
who will not agree to the ‘assertion that the great need of all of them, and of the pri- 
mary and ungraded schools especially, is better teaching. Few, if any, will enter a 
demurrer to the stronger assertion, that the great ma, jority of our teachers do not know 
enough of what they teach, nor know definitely enough what they do know. Fewer 
- still will refuse to subscribe to the statement that full three-fourths of the six to 
~ seven thousan' common school teachers of the State are wholly or largely without 
that professional knowledge, gained from systematic professional training or from 
professional st! dy and experiment guided thereby, whi ch is essential to anything 
dike the work we have a right to expect and demand in our schools. They are, the 
great mass of them, blind experimenters or servile imitators of others, mechanically 
plodding in old and time-worn ruts.” hs 
“The majority of rural and ungraded schools are a failure pen, judged by a fair 
standard,” says the cominittee appointed by the Teachers’ Association of Vermont in 
1880. ‘Teachers who are graduates from these schools of inexperience only, degrade 
public instruction, squander public funds, and debauch public opinion. ‘Vermont 
has had too much of this already; otherwise there had been no need of this report. 
Nearly every argument for the existence of the common school is an argument forits 
improvement. How can this be better done than by, improving its chief factor—its 
chief officer—its teacher? Can this be done efficiently inany school that does not hold 
_ such work as one of its prominent objects?” (Published by the State superintendent 
as a part of his annual report for 1880, p. 23. Dag heh eet 
Jn the State report of New Hampshire for 1882 it is said that— : 
«The scholarship of many of our, teachers is too limited and inaccurate, and they 
Jack the power to instruct according to the approve practice of the pest educators. 
There is among them a fatal want of knowledge of the laws of mind growth and the 
natural order of studies. Not infrequently they confound silence with order, and 
mistake mental stagnation for mental digestion. Withsuch drawbacks the physical, 
intellectual, and moral faculties of children can not be so disciplined and informed as 
* to fit them to do their best in the industries and responsibilities of after life.” 
“A good school without a good teacher is ar impossible thing. The most di- 
rect way, shprenye; to improve the schools of the State is to improve its teachers.”

THE TEACHING FORCE OF NEW ENGLAND. 339” 
In their annual report for 188586 the Connecticut Board of Education make the 
following observations regarding the system supervised by them : ' 
“(We make our statement with a full sense of its gravity and of the concern which 
it will excite in all thoughtful minds, but we find the fact to be, and we must state 
it as we find it, that the common-school system of this State is in a most unsatisfac- 
tory condition. * * * 
‘IIT. There is too little really first-rate teaching in our schools, and too much that 
is very, very poor. 2 
““1. The teachers do not know enough.—It is a # ‘eat mistake to suppose that a com- © 
mon-school teacher does not need to know much. It is impossible for any teacher to 
have too large a reserve fund of general information and of well ordered knowledge. 
» * * But many teachers have no general information at all. They are not famil- 
iar even with the common-school branches they are undertaking to teach. This is 
manifested by an inspection of schools, and also by the results of the State examina-_ . 
tions of teachers. The answers given to questions about common-school studies by 
some persons who are at present teaching 1n the schools of Connecticut reveal an 
ignorance which in a teacher is appalling to contemplate. * * * Ofthe 406, who — 
have so far undertaken the examination, only 70 have passed well enough to receive 
a certificate. ‘ 
2. These teachers have not sufficiently well-trained and disciplined minds.—There is 
much education of faculty which can only come to scholars through daily contact 
with a clear orderly mind. The loss to the children of the State in missing the in- 
fluences, which fairly lucid and logical ways of thought and expression in the teachers 
would exert upon the scholars, is greater than most people realize. Not afew teachers 
are too young and unmature. Some are not over sixteen yearsold. Many others are 
not well educated. * * * The trouble with many teachers is that they, never had 
any education at all, except what they have picked up in their own poor district 
school, where bad methods are perpetuated from generation to generation. 
“3. The teachers do not know how to teach, nor (4) what to teach, nor (5) how to 
organize and manage a school.” 
Secretary Hine, of Connecticut, in his report on the results obtained by the exam- 
ination of the schools of New London County, 1889, speaks of the condition of the 
teaching force in the following terms: 
‘*Many of the teachers are very young. Presumably boys and girls at sixteen are — 
not old enough to be intrusted with the training and discipline of children. * * * 
Their education is often entirely inadequate. They advance from the highest class 
of the district school to the teachers’ desk. They may haye attended an academy for 
a term or two in the winter, but the astonishing ignorance which can exist after 
attendance upon a high school does not make such attendance satisfactory evidence 
of education sufficient for a‘teacher.” 
Observe how these gentlemen emphasize the fact that the great majority of the 
teachers of the schools come immediately from the very schools whose elevation is 
the'purpose of the State normal school. It is frequently affirmed that to have been 
well taught is the best way of learning to teach others. Assuming that there is a 
certain force in this claim still it rests wholly on the ground that the teacher who has 
completed his education in the public schools has been well taught, a proposition that 
is belied by the experience of the normal schools, as has been shown in the preceding 
chapter. For even in Massachusetts, where every township of 500 inhabitants’ must 
maintain a high sebool, and many with fewer inhabitants do maintain one, and;where 
population is denser than in any other State of the Union, with the exception of Rhode 
Island, only about 50 per cent. of the pupils admitted to the normal schools have 
graduated from a high school. In States less favorable to secondary education the 
percentage must be much lower. Twenty-eight State schools that reported to the 
committee of the National Educational Association put the per cent. at 122, the city 
schools replying 100 per cent., as might be expected. Even in Massachusetts and 
Rhode Island about one-fourth of the pupils are the childron of farmers; in agri- 
cultural States the per cent. is much larger. But this has been touched on in the 
preceding chapter. 
However the difficulty noted in that chapter is not one that has been peculiar to 
America. ‘Iho problem which has had to be solved in modern times,” says Mr. C, 
_C. Perry, in a recent report on German training colleges, ‘is how to graft the specific 
training of schoolmasters, such as is provided by training colleges (normal schéols) 
on the general elementary school course so as to form one connected whole. The 
question as to the best means of effecting this particular object has been discussed in 
Germany during the last fifty or sixty years.”’! 
At first, continues Mr. Perry in substance, intending normal pupils—a considerable 
' portion of whom come from the elementary country schools—received private in- 
struction from schoolmasters to whom they were assistants. This, of course, not an-

swering, preparatory schools (Priiparenden-Schulen) were instituted in Prussia and 
other states. Though they were private schools they were usually connected with 
the normal school. In Bavaria in 1857, however, the Government divided each ad- 
4 ministrative district into eight or twelve school districts in each of which a school- 
master or clergyman was especially commissioned to prepare pupily for the normal 
schools. Prussia, on the other hand, placed the preparatory training of such pupils 
in the hands of private instructors especially appointed by the Government, the num- 
ber of pupils for each being limited to three. This very much resembles the pupil- 
teacher system that obtains in England to-day. But the folly of permitting inexpe 
enced boys fourteen or fifteen years old to teach and of supposivg that after having 
done his own day’s work the master would devote himself with ‘‘geistiger Energie” 
to the instruction of his assistants for two hours more was soon recognized, and in 
1872 the systematic organization of preparatory training schools in Prussia began. 
But ‘‘the question whether the instraction which intervenes between the elementary 
school and a normal school ought to be more of a special or general nature is one of 
those about which there has been most doubt.” The programme of the Prussian 
course has been given on p. 304 and that of Bavaria on p. 305, Mr. Perry gives the 
statisties—which it appears are somewhat difficult to obtain for Prussia—of nine 
schools, as follow! ,

Tan Teacumrs’ SALARY IN HUROPE. 
In “a preliminary note” to the work from which we have taken the matter here 
given as to the pay ‘of teachers in foreign parts, Mr. Ernest Pelletier, assistant chief 
of the bureau immediately attached to the French ministry of public instruction and 
fine arts, speaks as follows of the sources from which his information had been 
obtained: r 
«The present compilation has been formed by the courtesy of the representatives 
of France pbroad and her diplomatic and consular agents, through whom the origi- 
nal documents have been obtained. Many heads of departments, notably Monsieur - 
Germain, director of primary instruction in Belgium; Signor Rivera, chief of primary 
instruction in Lely, and others, have had the courtesy to lend their assistance in 
consummating the work.” 
; GERMANY. 
In Germany th condition of affairs is very similar to that in the United States; each 
state of the Empire, as each of our States, fixes the pay of its teachers and the manner 
of appointing them. The order given in the work from which we have obtained our 
information is that followed here in presenting it in the form of an abstract.

florins ($130); below 2,500, 350 florins ($150.50). In 1874 the poor pay of the teachers 
of the smaller communes was bettered. In the communes having fewer than 2,500 
inhabitants the minimum salary was fixed at 450 florins ($193.50), and, in communes 
having 2,500 to 10,000 inhabitants, 500 florins ($215). This increase is to be made at 
the expense ee State. After ten years of service the teacher becomes entitled to        an increase of $22.50, which is doubled for every additional five years he teaches.  Itis 
the rule that the teacher in communes of fewer than 2,500 inhabitants has the use of a®

a fixed annual sum, a certain number of bushels of wheat, the value of which they 
receive in money according to the current price, a lodging, andin the country a field

  CHAPTER XIII. . 
- PROFESSIONAL WORK IN THE NORMAL SCHOOLS OF THE 
UNITED STATES.! 
THE RELATION OF THE OBJECT OF EDUCATION TO THE NORMAL-SCHOOL CURRICULUM. 
It is frequently asserted that as law schools teach law and medical schools medi- 
cine, normal schools should teach pedagogy. But the lawyer—the graduate of the 
law school—does not carefully instruct his client as to the mysteries of a contract 
or a tort, nor the physician his patient in therapeutics or symptomatology ; for the . : 
object of the one is to present. his case in its most favorable light and of the other 
to restore his patient to health. Thus both use their art to effect its object; that ob- 
ject becoming more generally effected, certainly so in the case of medicine, as a science 
is porsloped from the practice of the art. 
Now, if an inquiring mind were to ask, ‘‘ What object does the science and art of 
teaching propose to itself?” it may be that different ages and different nations 
would give different answers. Because it is a ‘“‘chief project of that old deluder 
Satan to keep men from the knowledge of the Scriptures,” said the Puritans, adding, 
**to the end that learning may not be buried in the grave of our forefathers.”? Be- 
cause. “the very life-spring of the Reformation was reading the Bible by the laity,” > 
said Luther and his brother reformers in Germany. Because a boy knowing how to 
read ‘‘might read his Bible and learn to fear God and be ashamed and afraid to do 
wrong,” said Knox and others who established the parish schools of Scotland.* Because 
it is necessary to make ‘little boys and girls into free men,” says the French Re- 
public in its year III (1794).5 Because it is necessary to develop the threefold na- 
ture of the child, says the Nineteenth Centuty, etc. 
It is quite fair to conclude from the foregoing that illiteracy was, in the days ot 
the Reformation, the evil that was to be guarded against, and that then the production 
of free men or the harmonious development of the threefold nature of the child would 
take care ofitself. Under such circumstances the science and art of teaching was a 
very simple matter indeed, though somewhat above the capacity of a modern graye- 
digger or bell ringer. But this simplicity is turned into the highest complexity when, 
in order to effect the pupil’s harmonious development, it has become the teacher’s 
duty not only to teach the child to read, but in addition to contend with heredity, 
with bad home influences, and insufficient food and clothing, for it necessitates the 
teacher’s own harmonious development as a many-sided genius in the first place. 
To give the requisite pedagogical training, certain studies have been introduced in 
our schools for training teachers which go by the generic.name of ; 
PROFESSIONAL STUDIES. 
The conditions as to time and place under which these studies are pursued is set 
forth in the tables and analyses that immediately follow, but as an introduction te 
them it is advisable to dwell briefly on the study of psychology, since it is claimed 
that psychology is the basis of the science of education. 
We all know of Monsieur Compayré, whose History of Pedagogy has been trans- 
Jated and annotated for us by Professor Payne. In a late work on ‘Psychology,

and the New Testament.

a i d to Education,” M. Compayré opens his treatise, a schoolbook, in the follow- 
ing terms: : ; 
coW hy, shoe the study of psychology, formerly the privilege of classical second- / 
ary institutions, have been recently introduced into our elementaxy instruction—into 
the programmes of our normal sc! ools? Why, also, has it been even more recently 
inscribed to some decreas n the programme of special instruction 2” and he proceeds) 
to answer his inquiry in this fashion: . a 
The first and the most useful of all the sciences is that which is condensed in this 
simple maxim, ‘ Know yourself.’ To know yourself is truly the key to all the moral 
sciences. ‘To know yourself is to know all men, It is to grasp the principles upon 
which rest all the knowledge that relates to moral nature and humanity. History 
would be only a succession of incoherent facts, an enigmatic procession of uncompre- — 
hended personages for him who has not jearned in the school of psychology to unravel 
the interior motives, ideas, feelings, and passions which set man in motion, How 
may one pretend to direct forces of whose nature one is ignorant?” 
Two questions seem to offer in connection with psychology asa study capable of 
giving the ability mentioned in the foregoing quotation. Inthe first place, will text- 
     
   
Dook psychology suffice? and in the second place, what is the connection between the 
practical psychology or experience of the practice or model school and the theoretical 
psychology of the class room ? 5 
On the first of these doubts M. Compayré speaks as follows: 
“Tt is too frequently forgotten that adifference exists between the scientific study 
of psychology and the teaching ofits elements. Psychology, properly so called, con- 
sidered as a science, the object of profound research of philosophy, is one thing ; quite 
another school psychology—the psychology of the class room. Long ago this dis- 
tinction was made for easier sciences; history, for example. We do not confound an 
historian and a professor of history; a book of profound erndition, as Henri Martin’s 
Histoire de France, and the manuals that are usually placed in the hands of students. 
Authors of treatises on psychology are not always conscious of the wisdom of making 
this distinction. Their works are pretentious, even to the extent of being scientific, 
rather than works of a popular nature and for general education. The professor of 
psychology especially considers, then, that a choice is to be made between useless facts 
and eneumbering details and those truly useful which offer a practical interest while | 
their simplicity and their clearness make them accessible to immature minds.” 
ut should the practical exercises of the practice school wholly precede the study 
of psychology of the class room, or wholly follow it, or go hand in hand with it? 
If, in conformity with the usage in American normal schools, we conclude that the 
Jast is the best method, can a text-book, such as M. Compayré advocates, be made 
subservient ‘9 such method? It would seem that much depends upon the teacher, 
who should be, it seems to us, a passed master in the scientific—the real—psychology 
that M. Compayré claiins is inappropriate in the class room. Without pursuing the 
jdea further it may again be said that it has been remarked by another learned ped- 
agogue and Frenchman, M. Gréard, that) the application of psychology to education 
pecomes more delicate the more ignorant the elementary pupil who is under instruc- 
tion; from which it follows that the normal student should be well grounded in psy- 
chology before attempting to teach in the practice school, Z 
y the side of psychology stand the ‘ science of education,” “methods,” ‘school 
management,” and, most favor d of, all the so-called ‘history of education,” which, 
however, is usually nothing more than a Citon ola, arranged résumé of the 
theories of education held by practical or unpractica: thinkers. The historical facts 
that Germany has a professional corps of teachers and that we haye not, may be 
ascribable to the influence of the theories of a Pestalozzi or a Basedow in Germany 
and.of the monitorial system in America; but these theories are not the history of 
education, but a possible explanation of these historical facts. J 
+ is nob so easy to define sharply the difference between the “science of educa- 
tion” and psychology, especially “educational psychology.” It was not at all sur- 
prising to have a principal of a Wisconsin normal school say that the first four 
heads of the qualitative tables that follow were ambiguous. It is becanse they are so 
ambiguous, 2nd yet so much talked about as though they were not, that has caused 
us to compile the tables. Other than their completeness they contain nothing new. Ra Meri Phe ae

4 PROFESSIONAL WORK IN NORMAL ScHooL”s. 858 
ANALYSIS OF 9 FOREGOING TABLE. 
Twenty-nineinstitutions are represented in the foregoing table which deals with the 
schools of the so-called North Atlantic Division—a geographical rather than a sec- 
tional distinction. Two schools—the third and fourth established in the country at — 
public charge—do not report for columns 2-13. 
Of the 29 schools 27 have instruction in the history of education. Of the 27 re- 
porting that they teach the subject 25 report the time a week devoted to it; in 11 
instances this is 5 hours, in 8 cases 4 hours. Twenty-three of the 25 schools reporting 
times a week devoted to the study report the weeks in course; in 10 instances the weeks 
n the course aro 19 or 20, in 6 instances 10 or12 weeks. Twenty-three schools report 
the number of pupils in the course of history of education, and also the “pupils in 
she science and aré of teaching.” It appears from a comparison of the totals of these 
two items that 17 per cent. of the pupils in the science and art of teaching (Col. 14) 
in the institutions reporting are in the course of the history of education (Col. 4). 
If we compare these figures with those obtained by the committee on methods in 
aormal schools of the National Association of Teachers we shall find that of 74 schools 
reporting ‘‘ 44” says President Gray (i. ¢., the committee) ‘‘ report ‘ history of educa- 
sion’ as a part of the course of study ; the average time in months is 34.” Counting 
| weeks to a month this average in terms of weeks would be 13. The statistics for 
the North Atlantic Division show about the same average as the results of President . 
Gray’s inquiry in May, 1887. ' 
In obtaining the numerical relation which the pupils in each “ professional” sub- 
ject bear to the whole number of pupils in the ‘ professional” course of science and 
art of teaching (column 14), it is very apparent that a great deal depends on what is 
included in column 14. If all the students in the general professional course are also 
in each or any one of the professional subjects of history of education, science of edu- 
cation, etc., it is very evident that the ratio of the pupils in each subject will be 100 
ver cent., that is to say, 100 to the 100 of the students in the professional class or 
department. Butif only a half or a third of the students in the professional depart- 
nent (column 14) are pursuing any one of the professional subjects, it is equally 
evident that 50 or 66 per cent. are not in that study. We do not suppose that the 
reader is unacquainted with these elementary principles that we mention them; all 
we desire is to call attention to the importance of column 14, for averages are 
treacherous when the elements from which they have been produced are not fully 
recognized. « 
Passing now to the study of ‘science of education, ” we find that 23 schools report 
the time devoted to the study during the week—in 12 instances, 5 hours; in 7, 4 
ours; in 4, 3 hours. Allof the 23 schools reporting time a week also report the 
weeks in course—in 11 instances it is about 20 weeks, in 4 it is 10 weeks, in 5 it is 
about 40 weeks. Twenty-one schools report pupils in course of ‘‘science of educa- 
tion,” (columns 5,6,7,) and also those in the general course ‘“ of science and art of 
teaching.” (colamn14). A comparison of the aggregates of these two items shows 
that 22 per cent. of the general course are pursuing the specific study of the science of 
education. 
Of the 74 schools of President Gray’s report ‘‘34 include ‘science or philosophy of 
sducation’ with an average of 3; months,” thatis to say, 13 or 14 weeks. The figures 
of our table, if added and averaged, are far above this. It is useless to draw compari- 
sons until our tables have been given the critical examination by the public they 
should be subject to in order to render them perfect by correcting the errors that 
statistical tables are particularly liable to conceal—the putting under the same head 
things which only in part or not at all belong there. This error arises from each corre- 
spondent giving bis own qesning to our questions ; his figures we have, his interpre- 
‘ation of our inquiries we do not have. ‘ 
Columns 8, 9, and 10 deal with the subject of school management and methods, 
{t is a question if this is not in reality two subjects. However this may be 24 schools 
have given the time devoted to it, though in all probability it sorely puzzled some 
principals to oblige us with an answer. Of these 24 schools, 10 devote 5 hours a week 
to the subject, 6 schools 4 hours, and 4 schools 3 hours. ‘Twenty-one of these twenty- 
four schools report the weeks in the course—in 10 instances, about 20 weeks, in five, 
from 10 to 14 weeks, in 7 instances about 40 weeks. Comparing the aggrevate of pu- 
pils in the course of school management and method (columns 8-10) with the ag- 
uregate in the general course of science and art of teaching (column 14) as we have 
done before we find that 37 per cent. of the pupils in the general course of science 
and art of teaching in 19 schools are also in the course of school management and 
method in those 19 schoois. 
In turning to Professor Gray’s report for light on this dark interrogatory we find 
that, ‘* This question [School Methods] taken in connection with the one asking for 
the list of subjects would change the import of the figures in a fewcases. In nearly 
all instances the subjects are the common-school branches, but afew schools evidently

cover all their professional work, including history and science of education, school 
economy and discipline, psychology, and even practice teaching y this term. peep eget 
In some cases the ae taken in other professional work is evidently ineiuded. In 
others, the reply is ‘ all of the time,’ showing that the only teaching in’m thods is 
- that by example, or example strengthened by incidental ‘allusions to underlying 
principles. One school reports ‘all the time that is needed.’ The time given varies 
‘all the way from 2 to 20 months. . The average of the 57 schools replying appears to 
be very close to § months, one recitation daily. Itis to be observed, however, that 
this time includes in many cases 80 much of that’ given to mental science as to re- 
duce the time allowed for methods to perhaps 6 months.” | ) ' 
Turning again to the table it appears that the average of 8 months is too high fo: 
the North Atlantic Division, for, excluding the course, of 80 weeks at Fredonia the 
average for the division is about 25 weeks, and with those 0 weeks only 27, It 
would appear that itis perfectly proper to place the average at 6 months. 
We have now Pa ‘at the study of psychology. Twenty-five schools report, the 
"time devoted to the subjeci i t—in 14 cases 5 hours, in 9 cases 4 hours. The same 25 
schools report the weeks in the course; in 11 cases about 20 weeks; in 5 cases from 
- 10 to 13 weeks; in| 6 cases 28 or 30 weeks. Twenty schools report both as to the num- 
per of pupils in psychology (column 13), and as to the number in the general course 
of science and art of re (column 14). 
th A comparison of the aggregate of these 
“items shows 22 per cent. of the students in the general course to pe also in the special 
course of psychology. 
“Jt is to be observed, however,” says President Gray ‘that this time [the 8 months 
given to methods included in many cases sO much of that given to mental science 
gy] as to reduce the time allowed for methods to perhaps 
[another name for psy cholo, 
an average of 6 months [24 weeks]. * * But asomewhat careful study of all 
the answers sense convinces me that it is possible to reach a fairly intelligent 
jdea upon the points covered. Out of the 74 schools returning answers, 59 ineluded 
mental science in their courses, though in a large number of cases without the use 
of any text-book. The time varies from 4 weeks to ‘all the time’ as reported from 
{school. The average of 58 schools is very close to 44 mon ths [18 weeks] one lesson 
daily.” Our weet? for this division of the Union falls a little above 21 weeks with 
y: 4 or 5 lessons dail 
The affirmative response to the inquiry ‘Do the pupils prepare sketches of lessons 
containing formal questions and presumptive answers » has been somewhat of a sur- 
prise. Of 26 re lies only7 are in the negative, aifd 4 not positively in the affirmative ; 
in the cities the answers are unanimously ‘‘Yes,” as we shall find. Professor Gray 
remarks in 1887 ‘‘A few of the schools appear to reauire a formal sketch of the lesson 
by pupils in the practice and method classes, including full written questions and 
answers; but most schools require nothing beyond ‘such’ written work as properly 
accompanies any recitation—a general statement of subject-matter and plan—leaving 
the adaptation to the inspiration of the moment.” 
Twenty-seven institutions report the number of years in the course of science of art 
of teaching (column 15)—in 8 cases it is of 1 year, in 14 cases of 2 years, in 3.cases of 3 
years. As TE report deals entirely with the curriculums pursued by the 
74 normal schools whose replies are the pasis of his generalizations, we can derive 
no assistance from his work in the way of verifying oF correcting our own in this 
and the remaining heads of the table. : ; 
The whanimity in England, France, Germany, in a word, the world over, in the 
opinion that a practice or model school is a necessary adjunct, either actually or to 
all intents and purposes, of a training school for teachers is borne out by the responses 
jn column 18, and needs no elaboration. But the times a week, or even the times 
during the day that the exercise occurs is quite another matter. The difficulty is to 
- eonnect the statitios of column 19, with those of 21, especially in those cases where 
the teaching is done in “periods.” Five undoubtedly is the number of times that 
the practica reer oceurs during the week while the course undoubtedly is, speak- Hs Uae i i poets ‘

PROFESSIONAL WORK IN NORMAL SCHOOLS, | 359 
ANALYSIS OF THE FOREGOING TABLE, 
In the West, including the Upper Mississippi Valley and the Pacific Slope under 
that term, we have reports from 25 schools. Of these 22 report quite fully on the 
subject now under consideration. 
Of the 22 reporting the time given weekly to the history of education, 13 devote 5 
hours a week to the subject and 6, 4 hours. Twenty-one of these 22 schools report as 
to the length of the course on the subject, 6 reporting a course of 18 or 20 weeks, 7 a 
a course of 10 or 12 weeks, and 6 a course of 15 to 17 weeks. This is just about the 
average found by President Gray on examining the replies of 44 selected schools, that 
is to say, about 13 or 14 weeks, as we have noted in commenting on the preceding 
table. 
Of the 23 schools reporting the time given to tho science of education, 13 devote 5 
hours a week to the subject and 7,4 hours. Twenty-two'schools report the length 
of the course on this subject ; 8 reporting a course of 18 or 20 weeks, 9 a course vary- 
ing from 10 to 13. This, too, is but slightly above President Gray’s average. i 
Twenty-two schools report the time given weekly to ‘‘school management and 
and methods,” 16 reporting 5 hours a vreek, 4 reporting 4 hours. The length of the 
course in 21 of these 22 schools varies greatly, in 4 cases it is 20 weeks, in 4 it is 10, 
12, or 13, in 3 it is 24 or 26, in one it goes es high as 70, and in another falls as low as 
5. Ifcolumn 9 be summed up and the aggregate divided by the number of schools 
represented therein the result would be 27 weeks, which may be called an average, 
though not a “type.” 
Weare arrived now at the last of the theoretical suhjects—psychology. Twenty: 
three institutions report the time given weekly to this subject—16 schools give 5 hours, 
6,4 hours. The same schools report the weeks in the course, 6 of them a course of 18 
or 20 weeks, 5 a course of 10, 12 or 13 weeks, and 5 a course of 30 weeks. The average 
(22 weeks) is somewhat above that obtained by President Gray after careful study, 
to wit, 18 weeks. 
Eighteen schools report both for column 4 and column 14. Comparing the aggre- 
gates of the pupils of these schools in these columns we find that 12 per cent. of the 
pupils in the department of the science and art of/teaching are pursuing the study 
of history of education. Comparing in the same way the 20 schools reporting in 
columns 7 and 14, we find 16 per cent. of the pupils of column’14 pursuing the 
special course of science of education, and 32 per cent. of the students of column 14 ap- 
pear in column 10 (18 schools reporting), and 20 per cent. in column 13, 18 schools 
again reporting in both columns, It will be at once seen that these percentages are 
far below those of Table 1, with the exception of psychology, which is but two points 
behind. 
The course of science and art of teaching is rather longer in the West than in the 
East. Three schools have a course of 1 year, 6 a course of 2 years, 7 a course of 3 
years, and 3 a course of 4 years; to say nothing of the alternative courses of 2 or 3, or 
2 or 4 years, of which there are several. 
The same unanjmivy as to the value of the practice or model school (which is im- 
plied from its general adoption) prevails in this section asin the East. Again, we 
find that the practice in this school occurs daily, and again the same, or rather, more 
difficulty in connecting columns, 18 and 21. More than half (12) of the courses haye 
40 or nearly 40 weeks, one-third (7) have a course of 20 weeks

_ EDUCATION ‘REPORT, 188% 
I va Pee 
\ ANALYSIS OF THE FOREGOING TABLE, 
  Twenty-three institutions report in Table 3, 12 from the South Atlantic and 11 
i from the South Central Division. Of these only half report very fully. Thirteen 
, report the time a week given to the history of education (5 schools evidently do not 
have the subject), in 8 instances 5 hours, the others varying from 1 to 4. Twelve of 
‘ the same schools report the weeks in course; in 8 instances 10 to 14 weeks, in 2 in- 
stances 20 weeks. The 40-weeks’ course of the Jacksonville (Ala.) school, and the still 
longer one of the Branch Normal College of Arkansas, bringing the “average” length 
of course considerably above the “average” of President Gray’s 44 schools for the 
country at large; but if these two be omitted the “average” will fall a week or two 
below his estimate. a 
‘Thirteen schools report time a week given to the science of education; 6 schools 
give 5 hours to it, 4 schools 2 hours. ‘Pwelve of these report the weeks in the course 5 
in 6 cases 12 to 14 weeks, in2 cases 20 weeks. Averaging the column the result is 
much above President Gray’s average of 34 months (14 weeks), but taken the type 
as represented by 6 schools the results arrived at are about the same as obtained by 
. him. } 
se _ Thirteen schools report the time a week sean to school managementand methods, 
of which 6 report that 5 hours are given to the subject and 3 report that 2 hours are 
given to it. Twelve of these 13 schools report the weeks in the course; 4 report 11 
to 14 weeks, 3 schools report about 20 weeks, 3 schools above 36 weeks. President 
Gray found the average of 58 schools to be 24 weeks. : 
Fourteen schools report the time they give a week to psychology; in 9 instances 
5 hours, in 3 instances 2 hours. Six of the 14 schools have courses from 10 to 15 
weeks, 3 from 26 to 28 weeks, and 3 have a course of 40 weeks. President Gray’s 
average is 44 months (18 weeks) ; the column’s contents if averaged gives 23. 
The 12 schools reporting both in columns 4 and 14 have 23 per cent. of their pupils 
who are in the science andart of teaching department (column 14), pursuing the sub- 
ject of history of education. Comparing the numerical contents of columns7 and 14, 
| ‘under the same conditions, we find that 43 per cent. of the pupils in the science and 
art of teaching department (column 14) are pursuing the study of science of educa- 
tion. Performing the same operation with columns 10 and 14, we find -that 67 per 
cent. of the pupils in the science and art of teaching department pursue the study of 
methods and school management; while a comparison of columns 13 and 14 shows 
40 per cent, of the pupils in column 14 to be in the course of psychology. It will be 
noticed that these ratios are comparatively high. 
Twenty-two schools report the number of years in course—6 report a course of 1 
year, 5 a course of 2 years, 7 a course of 3 years, 3 a course of 4 years; 2 report an 
alternative course, one of 2 or 4, the other of 3 or 5 years. 
‘We miss in column 18 the continuity of affirmatives that is the striking feature of 
the same column in ihe other tabulations of this ser’ Nor does the exercise of 
teaching seem to occur daily in the great majority of instances, though this remark 
applies to the South Atlantic rather than to the South Central Division. The weeks 
in course vary greatly.

    PROFESSIONAL WORK IN NORMAL SCHOOLS. 865 
ANALYSIS OF THE FOREGOING TABLE. f 
If any schools for the training of teachers in this country ought to deserve thename » 
of professional it is the class known as city normal schools, A system of city schools 
is an educational unit, having its own chief, board, and system of government. Nat- 
urally when the need of trained teachers for its schools begins to be felt as retarding 
the growth of the schools such a system exerts its authority to supply the need, and. 
it is equally natural that the upper class of the high school should be looked to for 
the material of which to make teachers, and that, finally, a normal school should be 
the result of the attempt to train high school pupils for teaching. 
In the main, one of two reasons has been specially urged as validating the estab- 
lishment of city training schools or classes, one based on the inadequacy of the State 
normal schools to supply the city’s wants, the other on the assertion that there is 
something sui generis in each city system of schools that makes it necessary for each 
to provide its teachers in its own way ; for, to quote a western superintendent, ‘* Who 
can teach a system better than one who has been taught by it?’ The last reason 
seeming to indicate either that each city had a science and art of education of its 
own, or that the administration of its school affairs was so complex as to seriously 
interfere with the activity of the uninitiated teacher when she became a part of its 
educational machinery. 
However legitimate the claim may be that each city has an educational individu- 
ality of its own, there'can be no doubt that considerable individuality is shown in 
the manner in which the practical part of the training of the intending teacher is 
done. This individuality as to methods. of practical instruction embarrasses. this 
Office somewhat in treating of the class. To illustrate, let_us take the course at 
Rochester, N. Y., as described on paye 399 of our report fur 183687 ; the course is of 
40 weeks, but ‘‘ the class meets for one hour each week to discuss the topic assigned 
the previous week,” while for practice ‘all substitutes and temporary assistants are 
taken from the training class.” Turning now to page 417 of our 1887-’83 report we find 
under the caption “ Georgia” that Superintendent Slaton, of Atlanta, has assured us 
that ‘there are, strictly speaking, no normal schools in Atlanta or in the State of 
Georgia. We have a meeting every week to discuss methods, ete., and this is known 
as a ‘teachers normal class.’” Now, the only practical difference that exists between 
the Rochester and the Atlanta school or class seems to be that at the Northern city 
persons who are not yet teachers are trained for the duties of a teacher and at the 
Southern city persons who are teachers are trained for their duties; a distinction 
that approaches the vanishing point when it is remembered that the practice that 
Rochester girl receives is when she acts as a substitute or assistant teacher and that 
the Atlanta girl is employed in the same duties, only in her own right. Again, take 
the Welch school, of New Haven, where one-half of the year ‘‘the training class 
forms no part of the teaching force, but during the latter half the young ladies in 
training go into the class rooms to take their share in the actual work of the school.” 
How to ascertain, without a very voluminous correspondence, the distinctions that 
exist among city normal schools or classes and the number, character, length, and at- 
tendance of teachers’ institutes are questions that are as difficult to solve as their 
solution is necessary to the accuracy and completeness of the portion of the Commis- 
sioner’s report that deals with the training of teachers. 
We have 25 city normal schools in Table'4. With two exceptions they all present 
statistics. Of the 16 giving the hours during the week devoted to the history of 
education, 9 devote 5 hours and 2 devote 4 hours to the subject. Of these 16, 5 re- 
port a course of 20 weeks, 5 a course of 10 to 12 weeks, 3 a course of about 40 weeks, 
2 a course as low as 8 weeks. 
Seventeen schools report the hours a week given to the science of education; in 9 
instances 5 hours, in 2 instances 4 hours, and in 3 instances 3 hours. Sixteen of these 
schools report the times a week and the weeks in course; in 3 instances 20 weeks, in 
3 instances 10 to 12 weeks, 3 instances 8 weeks, and in 5 instances about 40 weeks. 
Nineteen schools report thé hours a week devoted to school management and 
methods; in 6 instances 5 hours, in 4 instances 4 hours, the other instances being 
mostly above these ‘‘centers.” Of these same 19 schools 18 report the weeks in the 
course; in 4 instances 20 weeks, in 3 instances 10 to 12 weeks, in 9 instances about 
40 weeks, in 2 instances about 28 or 32 weeks, 
Eighteen schools report the time given to psychology; in 11 instances 5 hours a 
week, in 2 instances 4 hours, in 3 instances 3 hours. Seventeen of these schools re- 
port the weeks in course ; 5 schools report 20 weeks, 4 schools 10 to 12 weeks, 2, 14,or 
15 weeks, 4 schools about 40 weeks, 1 school 80 weeks, and 1 school 24 weeks. 
Comparing the contents of column 4 with that of column 14 (excluding schools not 
reporting in both), $3 percent. of the students of 16 schools or professional departments 
of schools are in the study of history of education, 87 per cent. of 19 schools are in 
the science of education, 98 per cent. in school management and methods, and 89 per 
cent. of 20 schools are in psychology. 
Every school has practice teaching and, with but several exceptions, teaching to 
their fellow-pupils. he first, of course, was to be expected, the latter not. The

y In attempting to give an idea of the difference between the sections of the Union 
as to the hours a week devoted to these four subjects, and the length of the course, 
we experience more difficult, We shall assume that for the length of course there 
| are three typical centers, as it were, about which the number of. weeks in the course 
~~ seem to concentrate. These centers are 10 to 14 weeks, 18 to 20 weeks, from 36 to 40 
weeks, For the time given to each subject during the week we shall adopt two 
centers, 2 to3 and 4 to 5.

THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL TRAINING OF TEACHERS IN GERMANY. 
_ It is generally known, we believe, that the several European Governments, espe-

PROFESSIONAL WORK IN NORMAL’ SCHOOLS. 367 We are unable to say that Mr. Perry, an assistant master at Eton College, was in 
the employ of the British Government while residing at the German training col- 
lege at Weimar, or that he resided at Weimar and trayeled through Germany for the 
purpose of making the report which he presented to the ‘‘ Royal (English) Commis- 
sion on the Education Acts.” Nevertheless, in looking around for statisties of Ger- 
man schools to compare with those we have presented, it was with some pleasure 
that we found in Mr, Perry’s recent work on German training schools and colleges those 
which follow. It will be remembered that in Germany school programmes are made 
by the Government.

    CHAPTER XIV. 
THE “NEW PLAN” OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE PEABODY FUND, IN 1878.1 : 
In following the rise and development of the normal-school curriculum in Chapter 
X we neither spoke of the course of study in the South nor went beyond 1880, when 
it was said that “‘ the conception” was gaining ground, that teaching should cease to be 
an empirical art and should become a rational art; that the teacher should not only 
be instructed in processes, but should also be taught the body of doctrine that under- 
lies them and assures their validity.” To-day we find one of the pioneers of that 
movement, the author of the remark we have just quoted, at the head of an institu- 
tion which is ‘‘ a normal college for all the Southern States,” and from which teachers 
have been and will continue to be returned to their native States to carry out the 
benevolent purpose for which Mr. Peabody founded the education fund known by his 
name. 
Yet it is not to show the condition of normal training in the South, either before or 
after 1880, that attention is called to the inception of the idea that the purpose of the 
Peabody Fund could best be carried out by training teachers. Our object is to bring out 
the manner in which a body of gentlemen, selected from among the most distinguished 
men in the countrg, with, perhaps by, the advice of an eminent educator, abandoned 
their original method of advancing the purpose of their trust and devoted their 
otherwise insignificant resources to the preparation of teachers to supply the schools 
rather than assisting to supply schools to the people. Not that that original method 
was at all faulty or should originally have been subordinate to the other, but because 
the determination to use the income of the fund for the preparation of teachers, a 
determination arrived at after twelve years of pioneer experience, shows that the 
eminent men composing the board of trustees were convinced that the cheapest and 
surest way to advance a system of public schools as,soon as it has arrived at a certain 
rudimentary stage of. development, is to provide it with qualified teachers. We 
have endeavored to show how this was the idea of Mr. Dix and the New York Univer- 
sity board of regents, of Mr. Mann and his colleagues of the newly created State 
board of Massachusetts; and to emphasize and illustrate it we shall briefly follow 
“the new departure,” in 1878, of the Peabody Fund trustees. ‘The herculean work 
of establishing, we are tempted to say introducing, public schools into the war- 
devastated States during the first twelve years of the trustees’ activity does not per- 
tain to the subject matter of this section of the Report. 
Under date of February 7, 1867, Mr. Peabody addressed a letter, creating a trust, to 
the Hon. Robert C. Winthrop, of Massachusetts, and others, of which the quoted 
matter that immediately follows is a material part: 
“With my advancing years my attachment to my native land has but become more 
devoted. My hopeand faith in its successful and glorious future have grown brighter 
and stronger; and now, looking forward beyond my stay on earth, as may be per- 
mitted to one who has passed the limit of three-score and ten years, Isee our country, 
united and prosperous, emerging from the clouds which still surround her, taking a 
higher rank among the nations, and becoming richer and more powerful than ever 
before. t 
“But to make her prosperity more than superficial, her moral and intellectual de- 
velopment should keep pace with her material growth, and in those portions of our 
nation to which I have referred [those which had suffered from the destructive ray- 
ages, and the not less disastrous consequences of civil war] the urgent and pressing 
physical needs of an almost impoverished people must for some years preclude them 
from making, by unaided effort, such advances in education, and such progress in the 
diffusion of knowledge among all classes as every lover of his country must earnestly 
desire.” 
On March 15, 1867, Mr. Winthrop received from President Sears, of Brown Univer- 
sity, whom Mr. Winthrop had consulted as he himself had been consulted by Mr. 
Peabody as early as 1866, a letter of advice as to the manner of organizing the work 
_ ineident to the application of the income of the fund. In this letter the following 
paragraphs occur, marked respectively 2 and 5.

“2, As to plans and methods much is to becreated. We have nothing exactly like 
what is to be undertaken, There are no examples before you. There has been no 
experience directly in this line of action. Much must come by time and actual trial. 
Principles may be laid down, but there must be room for variation in details. 
“5, Of course effective schools, that shall be permanent, is the great desideratum. 
This is not only the best thing for the young, but they fubuish to the people at large 
the strongest argument in favor of popular education. Let good schools, springing 
up on the soil, growing out of the wants of the people, and meeting those wants, be 
sprinkled all over the South, as examples, and be made the nuclei for others, and let 
them be established and controlled as far as possible by the people themselves, and 
5 they will in time grojv into State systems, Besides the direct aid in the support of 
such schools, which would no doubt be the first work to be done, there are various 
indirect ways of reaching the same end. Normal schools, especially for training fe- 
male teachers for the primary schools; higher education given in the form of scholar- 
ships to a limited number of young men who would obligate themselves to teach for 
as long a period, at least, as that during which they received aid, or to refund the 
money ; encouragement to teachers’ associations by giving them $50 cr $100 to pay 
for the lectures at their meetings; aid to the editors or publishers of journals of edu- 
cation for the benefit of teachers, these might be some of the indirect methods to be. 
used.” M 
At the first business meeting, March 20, 1867, Mr, Peabody having expressed the 
‘wish that the fund be used in such a way ‘‘ as would, for the present, give an educa- 
tion to the greatest number of young children,” Bishop McIlvaine, for the committee 
of investigation and inquiry, reported that ‘‘for the present the promotion of pri- 
mary or common-school education, by such means or agencies as pow exist or may 
need to be created, be the leading object of the board in the use of the fund placed 
at its disposal. 
*<That in aid of the above design, and as promotive of the same, the board will 
have in view the furtherance of normal-school education for the preparation of 
teachers, as well by the endowment of scholarships in existing Southern institutions 
as by the establishing of normal schools and _ the aiding of such,normal schools as 
may now be in operation in the Southern and Southwestern States, including such 
measures as may be feasible, and as experience shall dictate to be expedient, tor the 
promotion of education in the application of science to the industrial pursuits of 
human life.” 
One would think from the tenor of this report, which was adopted ‘unanimously, 
that normal training was the great object of the trustees from the very beginning. 
The test of this will be acomparison of the sums deyoted to the training of teachers 
and to fostering public schools. In making this comparison, the form in which the 
‘ agent of the fund made his financial statements until 1873 obliges us to consult our 
convenience and to begin with the distribution for that year, the date at which the 
antount distributed was larger than it had been before or has been since.

- Comparing the columns of the foregoing table with those of Tabulation L, page 328, 
a difference is at once observed. The changes of the table under review want the 
rhythm that distinguish those of Tabulation L. We would attribute this to the differ- 
ence between a system organized and in motion and the organizing and putting a sys- 
tem in motion by bearing help where it would do the most good. 
Another phenomenon is the fluctuation of the percentages for the amounts appro- 
priated to public schools, Even without the percentages of the next following col- 
umn, which properly should be added to it, this column for public schoolsis extremely 
large at the date of 1873, being 89 (really 93) per cent. of the whole amount distrib- 
uted. But by October, 1881, it has fallen to 10 per cent., only to jump to 25 per cent. the 
following year, and again to sink, in a year or two, to 9per cent., and again to jump 
to 14 per cent, in the following year. Strange to say, each epoch of large or enlarged 
appropriation to foster schools is marked by the advent ofa new agent. As Dr. 
Sears observes, “‘Much [i, ¢., the better methods of distributing the income] must 
come by actual trial;”? and we find him constantly increasing the proportion of the 
income of the trust to normal schools and institutes until his death in July, 1880. Dr, 
Curry assumed charge on February 1, 1831, and in his report covering the year ending 
September 30, 1882, we chronicled an enlarged appropriation for the public schools 
and a diminished appropriation for the training of teachers. In the report for the 
year ending September 30, 1885, made by Dr, Curry just before leaving the country 
to assume the duties of our minister to Spain, the appropriation for normal schools _ 
had risen to the extraordinary height of 91 per cent. of the amount distributed, and 
the appropriation for the public schools had sunk to 9 per cent. Under Dr. Green 
a rise again occurred in the column containing the percentages of the amount appro- 
priated to public schoois and a corresponding tall in the percentage granted for train- 
ing of teachers. With one exception, however, we note also, that an inerease in the 
percentage granted to public schools is also accompanied by an increase in the amount 
distributed. 
Whether these facts show that each agent in turn as he became personally ex- 
perienced in the administration of his duties saw the advantage and necessity of 
training teachers in preference to fostering schools, or whether the facts be mere 
coincidences, is a \iuestion best solved by the distinguished gentlemen themselves, 
but that the table shows that a very decided departure was begun in 1876 and cul- 
minated in 1830, there can be no doubt. The table speaks for itself in its domain of 
figures. We will let the chairman of the board of trustees, their general agent, and 
the president of their normal college, explain this phenomenon shown by the statistics, 
and first as to the teality of the fact shown’by the table. ' 
In his address at the seventeenth meeting of the board of ‘trustees of the Peabody 
fund, Mr. Winthrop said: . 
“Having employed our means mainly during the last twelve years since our organi- 
zation in the more general interest of common school education and having thus 
accomplished our primary purpose, in awakening the attention of the Southern States 
to that subject, and in exhibiting model schools in many of their cities and towns, 
as examples and incentives, we may feel safe, as Dr. Sears suggests, in leaving that 
part of our work in the hands of the people to whom it is a matter of such immediate 
and vital concern.” 
In a letter dated April 28 1879, Dr. Sears observes, ‘‘ Ou the whole it now looks as 
if we should carry out our new plan—the improvement of teachers as successfully as 
we did our first—the establishment of schools.” ‘The trustees * * * having 
for some twelve years devoted their income to the establishing and fostering public 
schools in the Southern States,” says Dr. Stearns, president of the Peabody Normal 
College, ‘‘in the year 1876[8?] determined upon a new departure, which should con- 
template the gradual withdrawal of aid from the schoals, now generally able to sus- 
tain themselves, and the application of a much larger proportion of their income to 
encourage and assist in the education and training of persons to take the charge and 
instruction of them.” 
As experience has thus corroborated our statistics we turn to.consider the reason 
for this ‘‘new departure.” 
“Of the two grand objects,” says Dr. Sears in his thirteenth report (1879)', ‘which 
this board has from the beginning had in view * * * the primary one, has been 
so far attained that it may, in great part be safely left in the hands of the people, 
and our chief attention henceforth be given to the latter [the training of teachers]. 
* *“ *~ The existence of the school system being established as a part of the policy 
  
1Dr, Sears is quoted by the convention of the Vermont Teachers’ Association, appointed to investi. - gate normal schools. as saying: “Tf there is any one thing established by experiment, it is that in all great enterprises, surpassing the power of one man, combination of effort, strict. organization, superintendence, and the employ. ment of specialists to do special work, constitute the great law of economy. * * * We venture the assertion that in the opinion of competent judges, no school money in Europe or America has been more advantageously expended than that paid for normal schools.”

of every State, its active supporters are now considering by what means they can 
best elevate the tone of instruction. It is a pleasing fact that, at the very time 
that this board turns its attention to the improvement of the education given in the 
public schools, a widespead opinion is simultaneously springing up that the greatest 
want now existing in the several States is that of well-trained teachers,” One 
would infer from the language used by Dr. Sears that the public and the board had 
independently arrived at the same conclusion. Says Mr. Winthrop in October, 1883: 
“Through the wise and efiicient exertions of Dr. Sears we had succeeded, even be- 
yond our expectations, in awakening an intelligent and earnest interest in education 
in almost all those States for whose. benefit the trust is administered. * * * But 
here we were met also by the ascertainment of a great want which our work had de- 
veloped and-without the supply of which all further efforts would have been compar- 
atively fruitless. That want was the want of accomplished and capable teachers.” 
“Then was felt,” says Dr. Stearns, president of the Nashville (now Peabody) Nor- 
mal College, ‘‘as never before, the necessity for well-instructed, carefully-trained, 
earnest, and faithful persons to manage and to take.the charge of them [the public 
schools]. It was accordingly proposed by the Peabody trustees after a few years to 
devote henceforth a considerable portion of the money at their disposal to assist in 
the establishment of one or more normal or training schools.” 
“The instruction of the board,” says Dr. Curry in his first report (1881), ‘to apply 
the greater portion of the income of the fund hereafter to the education of teachers 
for the public schools has met with general and decided approval. Our chief edwca- 
tional want is better teaching.” 
As any effect may be looked upon as the result of an indefinite series of causes, so 
may it be viewed as a cause of an indefinite series of effects. We can trace the series 
of events that lead the trustees to devote their income to the training of teachers 
hack to the ideas, not less patriotic than philanthropic, of Mr. Peabody which caused 
him to create his trust.” But the effects of the “new plan” of the trustees have 
‘only completed their first stage, and yet a great normal college, ultimately in all 
probability to be magnificently endowed as ‘‘a special permanent monument of Mr. 
Peabody’s bounty,” has arisen—‘ The Normal School for the whole South.” 
“‘There are but few,” says Burke in his Present Discontents, # who are capable 
of comparing and digesting what passes before their eyes at different times and occa- 
sions, so as to form the whole into a distinct system. But in books everything is 
settled for them without the exertion of any considerable diligence or sagacity.” 
Thus admonished of the difficulties of foretelling the greatness of the Peabody College, 
we take leave of the three volumes of printed reports from which we have drawn the 
figures and upon which we have based the foregoing remarks,

INTRODUCTION. 
What the elementary school is.—In reviewing the entire course of man’s existence, 
differences in his powers at successive periods become apparent. These differences 
are so great that it is customary to divide the term of life into epochs or stages. 
The lines ofdemarkation between these epoclis are variously placed by different writers, 
but all agree in assigning to the beginning of the period of puberty a peculiar signifi- 
cance as marking a new era in life, Psychologists also recognize this point and 
indicate it as the beginning of a new period of mental activity—i.e., the stage of 
judging or reasoning. x 
Now, since it is essential that the studies pursued at any particular time shall be 
suited to the mental advancement of the student, the course of study should be so 
constructed that, when the pupil begins to think as a man, and to reason as a man, 
he shall be led into fields of effort different from those with which he has previously 
been familiar. New subjects should be introduced which require, in a greater degree, 
the exercise of his reasoning faculties. A new order of proceeding and exposition 
should be adopted in instructing him. 
To accomplish this most satisfactorily, the pupil is at this point transferred from 
the elementary school, which he has hitherto attended, to another department of the 
school systein, called the high school, whose organization is especially adapted to the 
new methods of instruction, and whose discipline is snited to his increased capacity 
for self-command. The question of convenience in school management also enters 
into the separation of the higher department from the lower, just as in the division 
of elementary schools into primary, intermediate, and grammar schools in many of 
the larger cities: but the difference between the elementary school and the high 
school is a real one, based upon psychological causes that are recognized, or are sup- 
posed to be recognized, in the arrangement of every course of study. 
If it be required, therefore, to give a definition of the place of the American elemen- 
tary school in the scheme of education, it may be said that in it is given that instruc- 
tion which precedes the assumption of the studies proper for the stage of reasoning. 
In practice the studies first taken up when this stage is supposed to be reached are 
chosen frem the following: Algebra, geometry, physics, chemistry, general history, 
and a foreign language, ancient or modern. 
The quantity of elementary instruction.—It is a well-established fact that the mind 
grows by the proper exercise of its faculties. Without such éxercise those faculties 
do not develop as rapidly as they might, and the probability of attaining the highest 
mental development is lessened in proportion to the time and opportunities lost. 
On the other hand, even greater danger may be apprehended from unwisely over- 
crowding the youthful mind and subjecting it to tasks too great for its strength. 
Hence it is important that careful attention should be given to the quantity of 
study of each kind which a child is required todo. He should not be kept upon the

: & es j ‘3 : simpler studies of the elementary school longer than is necessary to prepare him 
for those of the high school, nor should his mind be taxed with the severer studies 
before his capacity is fully equal to the task. ' ts 
It is still an open question as to what is the quantity of elementary stady which 
will furnish the proper training without loss of time, and yet without overcrowding. 
Eight years is the time indicated in a majority of cases, but an examination of the 
tables presented herewith discloses wide divergences from this time, Without de- 
scending further into details than to note the number of years, it appears that there 
are courses which cover 5, 6,7,74,8,9, and 10 years respectively. These courses, all 
have a common object in view, i. ¢., the high school, with its characteristic methods 
and studies. Now, the study of algebra, which is the best test of high school instrue- 
tion, requires the exercise of the same faculties, whether it is taken up in the sixth 
school year or inthe eleventh. ‘Then, if the opinion be correct that this branch with 
the others previously named represents the proper studies for a certain stage of men- 
tal advancement, it follows either that the pupils are prematurely forced in one case, 
or else that they lose several valuable years in the other. 
It is not within the purpose of these remarks to set forth the advantages of either 
a long or a short elementary course, but they are intended principally to indicate the 
purpose and value of the subjoined tables, and to direct attention to many other varia- 
tions, equally as radical, which are disclosed, in the hope that a general discussion 
of the points of difference may be productive of mutual benefit. 
CuARACTER OF ELEMENTARY TRAINING. 
In the previous paragraphs elementary instruction has been mentioned only in 
connection with its function of aiding in the development of the mind to the point 
at which a new epoch begins. But this is only a part of what the training given 
during this period must accomplish; for in common with all instruction it must also 
have in view the equipment of the pupil with facts useful for the present and profit- 
able in the future years of his life. 
American writers on education have generally been inclined in the past to take the 
view of instruction, including of course that given in the elementary schools, which 
subordinates the acquisition of knowledge for its own sake to the discipline of the 
mind. 
The position taken by James Currie in his ‘Principles and Practice of Common 
School Education” coincides with the opinions which a few years ago almost univer- 
sally prevailed in this country, and as an excellent presentation of this view one 
paragraph in this book is worthy of reproduction in full, His belief is that ‘On 
its intellectual side the school should seek to develop the powers of mind, so that the 
pupil may have the full use of them in after life. This consideration should deter- 
mine the whole work of the school. Present knowledge is not given for its own 
sake, or with a view to future professional occupation, but that the pupil who has 
gone through the process of acquiring it, may gain therefrom the power of acquiring 
for himself as much more as he needs and the disposition to do so. And according to 
the degree in which it tends to give this power is any branch of knowledge a suitable 
or an unsuitable instrument for school purposes. The school has a general, not a 
special, design; it does not consider how much of this subject or of that will be 
required to fit the pupil for such and such a position, but how it can best discipline 
his mind. The elevation of character implied in the attainment of this end will 
better prepare him for the position he may be called on to occupy than any accumu- 
lation of knowledge presented to him from its apparent exclusive adaptation to its 
requirements.” 
But recent years have given evidences of a departure from this position, and the 
Spencerian doctrine ‘that the acquirement of those classes of facts which are most 
useful for regulating conduct involves a mental exercise best fitted for strengthening 
the faculties,” is now widely accepted as true so far as it relates to elementary study, 
both in its direct and inverse application. Consequently, the writers of to-day mani- 
fest a strong desire to bring the subjects of schoo! instruction more nearly in a line 
with the immediate demands of actual life. Evidences are numerous that these 
utterances and beliefs have had their effect upon the courses of instruction. Such 
evidences may be found in the abbreviation of the study of arithmetic; in the rele- 
gation of the science of grammar to the highest grades; in the popularity of manual 
training; in the introduction of supplementary reading with information as its pri- — 
mary object; in the legal requirements relating to the study of physiology and 
hygiene; in the appearance in many courses of study of ‘‘civics,” bookkeeping, and 
other subjects supposed to have a direct bearing upon the pupil’s life and conduct. 
The disproportionate growth of the lower stratum of our educational system and 
the necessity it brought fora more rounded elementary training had much to do 
with this change of belief, if it was not the direct cause.
-P-A-G-E-447
  When the number of those who attended school was limited in a large measure to 
persons who anticipated a full course of study extending through the elementary and 
secondary school, the college, and the university, each department was practically a 
preparation for that which followed. The elementary school had for its chief object 
the development of the faculties to the point of ability to pursue the studies of the 
secondary school. The secondary schoo] was simply a preparatory department for 
the college, while the college merely continued the work of culture, and it was not 
until the university was reached that a beginning was made toward direct and 
avowed preparation for the work of life. 
For those who are destined to pursue the entire curriculum’ this is still the 
approyed regimen. | iy 
It would be a-needless waste of time to give any attention to the elements of alge- 
bra, geometry, civil government, and general history, or more than a modicum of in- 
struction in natural science in the elementary schoolsif all the pupils are expected to 
study these things in a thorough, scientific manner in a higher institution, But this 
is not now the case. The public schools are filled with those whose attendance is to 
cease at an early period, and the pupils who complete the entire course of instruction 
are too few toinfluence the shaping of that portion of the course which all pursue. 
About 84 per cent. of the children receive no formal instruction save what is given 
them in the elementary schools ; they must be informed of facts necessary to right 
living while there is yet an opportunity, 
Even if it be granted that the acquisition of such information is not ‘ best fitted 
for strengthening the faculties,” and that it would not ‘‘be utterly contrary to the 
beautiful economy of nature if one kind of culture were needed for the gaining of in- 
formation and another kind for a mental gymnastic,” the time which the great 
majority give to school work is too short to dwell upon the recognized disciplina: 
studies to the exclusion or neglect of the information-giving subjects. 4 
Social science, natural science, general history, algebra, and geometry are not, itis 
true, properly ‘‘information subjects” as they are taught in the higher schools, for the 
mental drill they give is such that their disciplinary value is even greater than their 
value in imparting knowledge. But the pupils in elementary grades are not ready 
for the deeper processes of thought involved in the proper study of these subjects, 
although a knowledge of their practical teachings is essential. Therefore it becomes 
necessary to divest these subjects of higher study of their dense garb of intricate 
reasoning, and to present the useful facts they teach clothed only in a thin garment 
of explanation which may be easily penetrated by the understanding of the elemen- 
tary pupil. t 
‘Thus it is intended that the practical lessons of the advanced and highly discip- 
linary studies shall be learned by the child who proceeds no further in the curric- 
wlum than the grammar school, and that his training, though less thorough, shall 
be nedrly as well rounded as that received by the high school or the college graduate. 
Mr. J. G, Fitch admirably expresses this principle in his ‘‘ Lectures on Teaching” thus: 
“The course should be rounded and complete as far as it goes, on the supposition 
that, except in the case of schools which are preparing for the university, there is 
little or no chance that the time of formal school instruction will be prolonged. It 
is by losing sight of this that we often commit the grave mistake of conducting the 
school education of a boy on too pretentious a plan and on the assumption that he 
is to make a long stay at school. And the incomplete frustum of a higher course is 
not of the same value as the whole of a scheme of instruction which from the first 
has a less ambitious aim.” 
With so much in regard to the general plan of the present elementary course. we 
may proceed to the consideration of the eftects of the changed purposes upon its de- 
tails. In this connection it is better to treat the several subjects according to the 
relative importance assigned to them rather than by considering the actual time de- 
voted to each. ‘In this way we may more satisfactorily judge the character of each 
course, both specifically and comparatively. 
For this purpose twenty-nine courses have been selected, representing all the sec- 
tions of the country and all the different periods of time covered, and the relative 
amount of time devoted to every subject in each course has been determined. In 
Table 2 may be found the result. Let us here remind the student of this table, in a 
parenthetical way, that the time which it is necéssary to give to a subject is not al- 
ways commensurate with its importance. or example, an important truth in phys- | 
iology, giving the pupils a knowledge of his duty to himself, or in sociology, show- 
ing him his relations to 
with that needed to instill a principle no more essential in mathematics or gram- 
mar. Such a table as this is most valuable in showing changes or differences in the 
several courses,

Reaping! ; t ‘ . ; } 
Prominent among the changes that recent years have brought in the educational 
field is the development of reading. From the partly mechanical exercise of involv- » 
ing only the oral interpretation of the written or printed word, the subject has grown 
until it embraces instruction in almost every subject within the range of the child’s _ 
understanding. Wy | , 
To the design of teaching merely how to read is now added the broad purpose of 
teaching what to read and how to utilize the fruits of reading. Thus the pupil is not 
only led into the domain of literature, but geography, history, and natural science 
all contribute to the store of facts acquired through ‘* reading.” 
With a few exceptions, like Macon, Ga., where the statement is made that ‘‘ the aver- 
age teacher can not do more than teach tke children to get the thought from the 
printed page,” and where a special teacher is wanted to teach pupils to ‘‘read enter- 
tainingly,” the oratoriecal feature of the subject is considered of secondary impor- 
tance at most. Mr. George Howland, in his report for 1887-88 as superintendent of the 
Chicago schools, says: 
“Above the primary grades the supplemental reading should be of such a character, 
I think, as to make reading a means and not anend. Reading should now be for cul- 
ture, forinformation, for broadening and deepening the knowledge and thought of the 
pupil rather than for cultivating oratory, so called, one of the most useless, if nor the 
most bepnioiousy exercises of the schoolroom.” And this is the view which generally 
prevails. x 
The Chicago course of study assigns 30.9 per cent. of the whole time in school to 
reading. In addition to Appleton’s series of five readers, Longfellow’s Evangeline, 
Hawthorne’s Wonder Book, Part II, and Whittier’s Snow Bound, which are regular 
text-books, the following are furnished by the Board of Education as supplementary 
reading: P

“The books for the fifth and sixth grades are furnished in sets of thirty copies; those 
for the seventh grade in sets of ten copies; those for the eighth grade‘in sets of fifteen 
copies, except Building of the Nation, of which five copies are furnished.” 
In New York City the plan of instruction in reading has recently? been modified, so 
that it now covers almost as wide a range as in Chicago. Suitable books on his- 
tory, biography, travel, descriptive geography, fiction, and poetry have largely taken 
the place of the old reading book, which, according to Mr. John Jasper, the superin- 
tendent, ‘is usnally a miscellaneous collection of short and unrelated fragments, 
_many of which awaken no interest on the part of pupils in these days of an abun- 
dance of interesting books for the young.” t 
To further emphasize the use of reading as a developer of the faculties and a means 
of imparting useful knowledge ‘‘silent reading by the pupils and the reproduction of 
the thoughts ‘read, in their own words, have been practiced with very creditable 
results” in New York and in many other cities of the country. 
In Boston the time devoted to the entire subject of language, including reading, 
spelling, writing, language lessons, and grammar, is 47.7 per cent. of the whole. 
Reading occupies a large part of this, but its proportion to the total time is less than

in either Chicago or New York. The list of books read, however, is even larger! and 
is less supplemented by what is called the ‘circulating-library plan.” 
This idea is peculiar to Boston and is worthy of particular notice. It can not be 
better described than by quoting the following from School Document No. 20, 1888: 
“The object of the plan is not only to aid pupils to cuitivate a taste for good and 
wholesome reading, but by furnishing them with good books for home reading to 
provide additional material for their work in composition and the study of English 
literature. 
“ Sets of suitable books will be purchased, each set consisting of sixty books. 
“Each set will be put up in a strong, well-made box with handles; the boxes to 
be made for the purpose, each set exactly fitting its box ; the division to which it 
belongs and the kind of books it contains to be marked upon each box. 
‘‘A report card, upon which the principal shall note the condition of book when 
received, will accompanyeach set. The principal of the school shall receiye the books, 
note on the report their.condition, and see to the distribution in the classes. 
«<The sets of books in each division will form a circulating library for thatdivision, 
to be moved from school to school at stated periods by the regularsupply team. The 
transfer of boxes will take place during the months of December and March.” * 
The following are the titles of the books supplied :

the books supplied are principally first and second readers of other series than those 
adopted as regular text books and as “‘ permanent supplementary reading” books. 
The New Haven, Conn., Indianapolis, Ind., Baltimore, Md., St. Louis, Mo., and Brook- 
lyn, N. Y., courses also assign a large proportion of the time to reading, and in all of 
them the purpose of obtaining information is no less conspicuous than that of culti- 
vating a good literary taste, and entirely overshadows the aim of securing distinet- 
ness of articulation and accuracy of oral reading, which is for the most part the work 
of the lowest grades.

EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
ARITHMETIC. ei r y Y 
Next to the errelopment of reading, the changes in the study of arithmetic are 
most significant in indicating the tendency of the time. 
Arithmetic has long been considered the ideal, if not the principal, disciplinary 
study. Its place in the old course was second to none. Its exercises were designed 
less to directly assist the pupil in the avocations of life than to call out his reasoning 
faculties, to cultivate habits of accurate thought, and to train his powers of analysis. 
These conditions are gradually changing. The belief is gaining ground that prob- 
Jems having more or less adaptability to the business of life, furnish as much insight 
into arithmetical logic as the elementary pupil has time to gain; that the discipline 
and information furnished by other subjects are more valuable than the discipline of 
those portions of arithmetic which convey no information likely to be profitable in 
the daily affairs of the average man. 
Less time proportionally is given to arithmetic in Chicago than in any other city 
in the country, only 9.3 per cent. being there devoted to that study ; while in Boston, 
notwithstanding the wide attention attracted to the ‘‘simplification ” of the subject 
and the reduction of the time devoted to it, it still apparently occupies one-sixth of 
the whole time. The school committee of Boston did not tit as advanced a posi- 
tion in 1887 when they struck from the required course ‘‘the mensuration of the 
trapezoid and of the trapezium, of the prism, pyramid, cone, and sphere; compound 
interest, cube root and its applications ; equation of payments, exchanges, similar 
surfaces, metric system, compound proportion, and compound partnership,” as did . 
Superintendent Howland in 1886, when he made the following a part of his annual 
report: 
u In the higher grades, too, many subjects have been introduced that are no part 
of arithmetic, in any true sense, as gold investments, United States bonds, insurance, 
banking, etc., which no child or man but the specialist will ever need. What busi- 
ness man ever resorts to the least common multiple or the greatest common divisor, 
topics upon which our pupils spend so much time which should be given to the use 
and the logic of numbers? * * * b 
“We are surely but slowly getting away from the so-called arithmetical analysis, 
which consists of a mere riddle of words to the young pupils, giving no knowledge, 
no intelligence, no reasoning power. 
“Much of this old analysis and definition had no other result than that of confus- 
' ing and confounding the pupil, and deadening his interest in the study and practical 
application of numbers.” 
Mr. Howland is not yet satisfied that arithmetic has found its proper place in the 
Chicago course, and he would evidently be content to see the time even further re- 
duced, for in his report for 1887~88 he says: 
‘<Tt has long seemed to me that in the city the eager heart must grow hungry over 
the dry fruits of 3 or 4 yearsin geography, a year and a half in United States history, 
and 8 years in arithmetic, with so little that interests or concerns them in their daily 
life or contributes to success or real intelligence. 
‘‘Why could not a course be provided in addition to the usual branches of the gram- 
mat grades to vitalize their work and awaken their observing and thinking powers? 
For instance, in the fifth grade once or twice a week place physics—matter, gravitation, 
weight, friction, force, power, inertia ; in the sixth, light, heat, sound; in the seventh, 
electricity and magnetism, with chemistry and geologyin the eighth. * * * 
a Perhaps better than twice a week would be to omit arithmetic or geography for 
a term.” 
Taking into consideration the small proportion of time already allotted to arith- 
metic in Chicago, Mr. Howland goes much farther than the great majority of the 
profession generally—certainly no other superintendent has expressed such radical 
views as those quoted. But, nevertheless, changes appear every where in the general 
direction of emphasizing the “little that interests or concerns the pupils in their 
daily life,” and of eliminating all those parts which ‘‘no child or man but the 
specialist will ever need.” i 
GRAMMAR? 
Grammar also shows the effects of the demand for a closer application of school 
studies to the duties of life. Many whose school attendance has not yet ended began 
the formal study of the structure of language in the earliest years of their school 
life. Parsing, analysis, declension, conjugation, etc., or what is frequently alluded 
to in late reports as “technical grammar,” but a few years ago were encountered by 
the pupil after 2 or 3 years of study at most. Statements recently received by this 
office show that at the present time, out of 69 of the principal cities, in but 2 (Mobile, 
  
1See Tables 1, 2, and 11. 2See Tables 1, 2, and &       
 
-P-A-G-E-451
    2 ry es na ‘ ss 
COURSE OF STUDY IN CITY SCHOOLS. 879 
Ala., and Utica, N. Y.) is the study of grammar begun as early as the third year, 
and in 1 of them, Mobile, the entire elementary course covers but 5 years. In 
only 2 cities (San Francisco, Cal., and Baltimore, Md.) is it begun as early as the 
fourth year. In 14 cities it-is begun in, the fifth year, in 27 in the sixth year, in 20 
in the seventh, in 6 in the eighth, and in 1 city, Burlington, Vt., not until the ninth 
ear. 
Table 8 shows these facts so far as 29 of the most important cities are concerned, it 
having been found impracticable to include all the cities in the more detailed table. 
This postponement of the study of grammar as a science does not imply the aban- 
donment for that time of all study of language, but rather a change which brings 
the art of grammar into greater prominence, for, as parsing, declension, conjugation, 
analysis, etc,, are pushed further up in the course, their place is taken by ‘‘conver- 
sation exercises” and ‘‘ language lessons.” In making such changes the reasons as- 
signed never refer to the general value of ‘‘ technical” grammar as a disciplinary 
study, and rarely to the inability of young children to study it with mental profit, 
It is conceded that the science of grammar as a means of culture has a value pecul- 
iarly its own, since it is the only study of the elementary school that deals not with 
the subject-matter, but with the form of thought, and hence the only subject that 
takes the pupil into the sphere of abstract thought. But in the admitted fact that 
the formation of habits of correct speech is not dependent upon a knowledge of rules 
and definitions relative to the constructions of language and their mutual depend- 
ence is found the justification for the lessened weight attached to such’study. 
As Fitch expresses it: 
“The practical art of using the language in speech or writing with good taste and 
correctness * * * is:probably best to be attained by talking to the pupil, by tak- 
ing care he heats little but good English, by correcting him when he is wrong, by 
making him read the best authors, by practicing him muchin writing, and when he 
makes a mistake by requiring him to write the sentence again without one. It will 
certainly not be attained by setting him to learn Murray’s, or, indeed, any other 
grammar.” + ‘ 
The art isthe thing directly useful; the science has no obvious relation to practical 
affairs, The ability to speak and write correctly is not only desirable but essential 
in every walk of life ; the technical rules of etymology and syntax are almost valu- 
Jess per se.. Therefore, in accordance with the movement whose progress is here re- 
corded, the art, i. e., the practical, increases in importance in the course of study, 
while the science, i. ¢., the disciplinary, decreases in the same proportion. 
GEOGRAPHY AND Hisrory.? 
In relation to geography and history it may be said that while in their treatment 
they have undergone important changes, those changes have resulted from the adop-' 
tion of more inteliigent methods of teaching rather than from any change in the gen- 
eral purposes of instructions, 
Essentially ‘‘information subjects,” they have always been taught with that end 
principally in view. That they were encumbered with useless details that drew the 
inind of the pupil from important general facts and ruling principles was due, not to 
a belief that such teaching was the more effective discipline of the mind, but to a less 
intelligent comprehension of what information best serves the pupil. Such changes 
being the result of greater efficiency on the part of the teachers are naturally followed 
by a clearer understanding and a more rational knowledge of the subjects on the part 
of the pupils. They further save the time previously frittered away for the acquire- 
inent of more advanced knowledge and, consequently, if no diminution of time ac- 
companies the adoption of better methods, a wider acquaintance with the subject 
taught may be expected. In the caso of geography and history no tendency is appar- 
ent to materially alter the time apportioned and there seems to be nothing to justify 
a belief that the time now devoted to these subjects is either considerably more or 
considerably less than at any recent period. 
The inference, therefore, is that at the end of the elementary course the pupil of 
to-day knows more that is worth knowing of geography and history than did the 
pupil of any past period. But whether the increased efficiency of the instruction in 
these branches changes the direction of the resultant of all the forces brought to 
bear upon the pupil’s mind is a question which depends upon whether the improve- 
ment in the teaching of the other subjects has progressed in the same ratio. Speak- 
ing generally, it is safe to say that the ability to distinguish between the essentials 
and the non-essentials in the accomplishment of a definite aim is displayed in no one 
particular branch more than in another and that in this respect the improvement in 
teaching has been uniform in all subjects. ;

  Hence the conclusion follows that the effects of the instruction in geography and 
history are relatively not greater in the course of to-day than in the old course, and 
that the general bent of the mind is not influenced by either of these subjects any 
more in the new education than it was in the old. 
The same applies equally to spelling and to writing, which are purely instrumentary 
branches, and in nearly as great a degree to drawing and music, the representatives 
of zsthetics in elementary schools. The ends in view in the teaching of all these 
branches remain what they have been since they were brought into the curriculum. 
More time, however, is given to drawing than formerly and somewhat more to music, 
but there has been no material change in this respect in the other subjects.! 
SuBsEcts COMPARATIVELY NEw TO THE COURSE. 
Having described the effects of changed conditions and beliefs upon the older 
bravches of instruction it is now in order to consider the new subjects which these 
conditions have caused to be brought into the elementary course. Of these the nat- 
ural sciences and civil government are now most generally taught. General history, 
algebra, geometry, and the several branches of manual training have not yet been 
extensively introduced, although each of them finds favor in the eyes of many of the 
foremost American educators, and it is probable that neither subject has attained 
its full degree of popularity. i 
German, French, and Spanish appear in some of the elementary courses, but they 
do not belong to the same category with the studies just named, for it can not be said 
that the object of such instruction is to give roundness and completeness to the char- 
acter of the training. This teaching is given only in those cities in which there is a 
considerable foreign element who demand instruction in their own language, and is 
based on local and administrative rather than on general and pedagogical grounds, 
for reasons of the latter class apply to immigrants only, and not to the great body of 
the pupils. 
Manual training represents the extreme application of the principle which demands 
that each course shall be complete in itself as far as it goes and shall impart knowl- 
edge capable of being applied in everyday life. While instruction in natural science, 
civil government, ete., seeks to add symmetry to the attainments and to make the 
pupil a more complete man by anticipating the high school and the college, manual 
training goes further, and by anticipating the apprenticeship or the technical school 
would contribute to the acquirements necessary to the complete workman. This sub- 
ject, however, was fully discussed in the Report of 1887-88, and further reference to 
it here is unnecessary. 
NATURAL SCIENCE, 
The time shown by Tables 1,2, and 13 to be devoted to natural science does not con- 
vey a correct idea of the importance of that branch of instruction in the course of study. 
- The figures represent in the main only the time occupied by those oral lessons given 
with the sole object of imparting such information, but equally as important as these 
are the reading lessons and the conversation exercises in which the subjects read or 
discussed are taken from the sciences. ‘These exercises have not the study of science 
. for their direct object, and the acquisition of scientific facts is an incidental aim 
only. In classifying them, therefore, they are considered as belonging to the in- 
struction in those subjects that furnish the primary reason for their existence. 
A pupil can not be taught to read understandingly unless something is provided 
whichis worthy of being understood; nor can a profitable language lesson be conducted 
auieut a subject of conversation worthy of the dress of language with which it is 
clothed. ‘ 
_ In reading the subjects are largely scientific through design, as already explained, 
but in the conversation exercises or language lessons by a sort of natural selection, 
the matters which are most likely to suggest themselves are those which are inciden- 
tally valuable in conveying information in the domain of the sciences. What better 
means, e. g., could a teacher adopt to draw her pupils into an unrestrained conver- 
sation in which she may have a favorable opportunity for criticising their forms of 
expression, than an informal talk upon some familiar animal, bird, or flower ? 
No satisfactory estimate can be made of the extent of the instruction given in ele- 
mentary science in this indirect way, but it undoubtedly plays an important part 
in the sum total of knowledge which the pupil receives during the course. We 
may, however, more accurately judge the amount of instruction which is given by 
-means of the regular ‘‘oral lessons” for which nearly all the courses provide. 
In Washington, D. C., science-teaching occupies a larger proportion of time than in 
any other of the twenty-nine cities selected, nearly one-tenth the time being so filled.

    COURSE OF STUDY IN CITY SCHOOLS. 381 - 
In the two lowest grades the time for science is equally divided between the observa- 
tion of plants, the observation of animals, and physiology. The last named branch is 
studied continuously throughout the course, especial attention being paid to the 
conditions of health. ‘‘The phenomena of vapor in its different forms and effects” 
are studied in connection with geography in the third year, and in the fourth the 
same subject includes a study of ‘the phenomena of contour, its causes and effects, 
or elementary physical geography and geology.” Physics is taken up more formally 
in the seventh year, its study embracing the following: 
“1, Matter and its properties: (a) Divisibility of matter—molecule. (b) Porosity. 
(c) Density. (d) Phenomena of attraction—gravitation, cohesion, adhesion; Consti- 
tution of matter; three states of matter—solid, liquid, and gaseous. 
“2, Heat: (a) Ways of producing heat—by mechanical force, by_ chemical force, 
(b) Effects of heat in matter—expansion, solids, liquids, and gases ; change of state— 
liquefaction, evaporation. (¢) Communication of heat—conduction, solids ; convec- 
tion—liquids and gases ; radiation. (d) Effects of heat in nature— dew, fogs and 
mists, clouds, rains, and winds. 
“3, Sounds: (a) Nature of sound—vibration; a vibrating body always the origin 
of sound; sound waves, (b) Transmission of sound—throngh solids, liquids, and 
gases; velocity of transmission. (¢) Pitch of sounds. (d) Intensity of sounds.” 
The San Francisco course also devotes considerable time to elementary science, 
physiology and hygiene receiving particular attention. In the schools of California 
practical entomology, a branch of science having a peculiar bearing upon the indus- 
tries of that State, is taught in accordance with the provisions ofaStatelaw. Espe- 
cial reference is had to insects injurious to crops and fruits. 
In Bosion, too, natural science receives its due share of attention. In the first three 
years of the course simple conversational exercises are provided for, in which lessons 
are given on the human body, familiar plants, animals, and the phenomena of nature. 
_In the grammar schools, these exercises are continued with a wider scope for the first 
two years; in the next or sixth year of school, hygiene and the common metals, min- 
erals, and rocks receive attention; in the seventh and eighth the work is confined 
to physiology and hygiene; in the ninth, the common facts of physics are taught by 
observation and experiment, 
In Cincinnati in the first four years of scheol the oral lessons relate principally to 
the human body and to the color, size, form, action, and uses of familiar objects, includ- 
ing plants, animals, flowers, fruits, grains, ete. In the fifth and sixth years the les- 
sons are more descriptive in their character, and are based upon such well known 
objects as dew, rain, snow, hail, frost, ice, fog, clouds, the sun, the moon, rivers, 
mountains, countries, etc. In the sixth year one lesson a week is given in elementary 
physics. The instruction covers “‘(a) matter, its properties, three states; (0) air, its 
composition, properties, weight, and pressure ; (c) effects of heat on air, winds, land, 
and sea breezes, cyclones, etc. ; (d) air rendered impure by breathing, ventilation: (e) 
water, its composition, properties, specific gravity, floating bodies, pressure; (f)' 
three states of water (solid, liquid, vapor), effects of heat on water, steam, specific 
gravity of ice; (g) formation of vapor in the atmosphere—fog, clouds, rain, hail, 
snow, dew, and frost.” Physiology is studied more minutely in the seventh year 
than in the previous grades, especial reference being had as usual to the conditions 
of health. 
In Indianapolis the work outlined for the first three years in plants, animals, and 
physiology is more than usually comprehensive. In the fourth year the work in com- 
position is closely related to the study of entomology, butterflies and moths being par- 
tieularly the subjects of investigation. Ornithology is the only branch of natural 
science studied in the fifth and sixth years, and, like entomology in the fourth 
grade, it is studied in connection with language. Physiology is taken up the eighth 
and studied from a text-book. 
In St. Paul, also, the work in science occupies a large place in the course of study, 
receiving nearly § per cent. of the whole time. All instruction in this line given in 
the first two years is in connection with language. In the third year herbivorous 
animals are studied in the first quarter, carnivorous animals are in the second, and 
other orders of animals in the third; in the last quarter zoology is dropped and 
botany is taken up, especial attention being given to trees. In the fourth year the 
study of plants is continued in the first quarter, giving way to ornithology in the 
second; birds and fishes receive attention in the third quarter, and in the fourth 
botany is again studied, this time more particularly in relation to flowers. Inverte- 
brates, the habits‘and uses of animals, the distribution of herbivora, rodents, birds, 
reptiles, and fishes by families, and plants useful to man for food, clothing, or shelter, 
are respectively.studies of the several quarters of the fifth year. In the sixth year 
rocks and minerais, atmospheric phenomena, water, and ethnology are the subjects 
investigated. The earth, forms and properties of matter, heat, and the mechanical 
powers are studied in the seventh.

eee EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
‘e j Re __ The ‘spiral course” arranged for the St. Louis schools by Dr. W. 'T, Harris during 
his superintendency should be mentioned. Its plan is thus described: 
‘The course should be sketched in such a way as to make several complete cireuits 
during the eight years of the district school course. The lowest one should seize 
certain striking features in each department, making a strong impression and 
silently determining the mind to reflection and observation in the domkin of 
natural science. The second course must travel round in the same path, but more 
systematically and in detail. The third one, still deepening and generalizing the 
ideas of the pupil, would make the effects permanent. ‘Lhree. courses were fixed 
upon for this reason. The 8 years of the district school course thus allowed 3 
years each to be given to the first and second course and 2 years for the third. Inas- 
much as the subjects were taken up with a considerable degree of scientific strictness 
in the high school, the course of study in natural seiences would now extend from the 
commencement in the primary schools to the last year of the high school. A pupil 
coming into any grade in the schools and remaining 3 years would known something 
of each of the great departments of nature.””?

GENERAL HISTORY.! 
General history also receives more attention than the accompanying tables indi- 
cate, since much of the supplementary reading is of an historical nature. No thor- 
oughly systematized course, such as those just described in science, is reported to exist 
in any of the larger cities, however, and all the instruction given is incidental and 
fragmentary. Camden, N. J., where Barnes’s General History is used as a text book 
in the eighth year, and Atlanta, Ga., and Wilmington, Del., where the History of Eng- 
land is formally studied in the highest grade, may be considered as exceptions to 
this statement to the extent of such teaching.

  i | GeomrtRY.! ‘ 
Geometry is taught in Baltimore, Md., New York City, Memphis, Tenn., and Belle- 
ville, Ill., forming a part of the instruction of the highest grade in each place. In 
Baltimore the first, second, and fourth books are studied, but by the boys only. Da- 
vies’s Geometry and Trigonometry is the text-book uSed, and nothing appears to indi- 
cate that the subject is not taught in the manner usual in high schools. Indeed, it is 
a question whether the boys in the eighth year of the Baltimore schools may be prop- 
erly considered as elementary pupils, for, in addition to this work in geometry, they 
study algebra through quadratic equations and physics ‘‘to acoustics.” 
In New York City the instruction is more elementary and less formal in character, 
only the fundamental theorems and problems being taught. 
In Memphis, Tenn., the course of study shows that the first book of geometry is taken 
up in the ninth year, and therefore whatever is taught of the subject in the eighth 
year must be of a simple and preparatory character. 
In Belleville, 1U., the following is prescribed : 
“(A) Geometrical concepts developed by means of object lessons, description of 
geometrical bodies, cube, prism, pyramid, cone, globe, tetrahedron, octahedron, dode- 
kahedron, icosahedron; plane surfaces bounded by straight and curved lines; angles 
and lines; easy constructions ; development of geometrical forms by motion of point, 
line, and surface. (B) Plane geometry to the theorem of Pythagoras. (C) Plane 
geometry completed and solid geometry, including the sphere.” 
ALGEBRA! 
i | 
Algebra is taught more generally than geometry, and finds a place in the course of 
nine of the cities in our table, namely: San Francisco, Cal.; Washington, D. C. ; 
Belleville, Il].; Peoria, Ill.: Baltimore,‘Md.; Camden, N.J.; Brooklyn, N. Y.; Utica, 
N.Y.; and Memphis, Tenn. It is also an optional study in New York City in the high- 
est grade. In all these cities, except Baltimore, the instruction in algebra is confined 
to the eighth year, but in Baltimore it is begun in the boys’ schools in the sixth year 
and continued through the rest of the course, The girls, however, do not begin the 
study till the eighth year. The boys take up addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division in the sixth year; factoring, greatest common divisor, least common 
multiple, fractions, and simple equations in the seventh ; involution, evolution, and 
quadratics in the eighth. The girls are taught the four fundamental rules in the 
eighth year. : 
In Brooklyn the instruction in algebra embraces a comparison of algebraic notation, 
with that of arithmetic, the fundamental rules, factoring, greatest common divisor, 
least common multiple, and fractions in the first half year ; and a review of the same 
and simple equations through three unknown quantities in the second half. In re- 
gard to the work of the first half year it is said: ‘The work in algebra prescribed for 
this grade may be properly termed literal arithmetic. The pupil’s knowledge of arith- 
metic should be utilized in teaching the algebra, and the study of algebra should give 
him a clearer idea of the principles underlying the operations in arithmetic.” 
The work in Washington is substantially the same as in Brooklyn, save that the 
pupil is carried no further than equations involving one unknown quantity. In 
Belleville the instruction is more comprehensive, covering as much ground as in Balti- 
more, though probably not so thoroughly, for it is given in only one year. Involu- 
tion, evolution, radicals, equations of the second degree, and progressions appear in 
the course prescribed. The extent and manner of the teaching of algebra in Camden, 
N. J., does not appear in the course of study. Brook’s Algebra is the text-book used. 
Clark’s Algebra in the hands of the teacher is used as a book of reference in San 
Francisco ; one oral lesson per week is given. The printed courses of study for the 
schools of Utica, N. Y., and of Peoria, Ill., contain no reference to algebra in the ele- 
mentary grades; written statements show that it is tanght twenty weeks in the former 
city and twelve in the latter, receiving two and one-half hours per week in each case, 
CIVIL GOVERNMENT.! 
Civil government is a separate branch of instruction in twenty-two of the eighty- 
two cities in Table 1; its principles are tanght in many more—nearly all, perhaps— 
incidentally in connection with history, geography, or like science and general 
history, as a part of the supplementary reading. The object of such instructions is 
declared to be better preparation for the duties of citizenship. In its usual applica- 
tion the subject embraces only the nature and forms of government, and the pro-

visions of the Constitution of the United States, and that of the pupils’ own State; 
but the study may be, and sometimes is, so broadened that it not only covers the 
elements of political science, but also trenches upon the domain of ethics. Several 
excellent text-books have been prepared but they are not extensively used except as 
books of reference, the instruction being-ehiefly oral—frequently in accordance with 
a general plan or a syllabus prepared by the superintendent. One of the best of 
these syllabuses is that which appears in the Manual of the Course of Instruction in 
the grammar department of the Philadelphia public schools! The instruction in 
thatcity is given in one year only, the eighth, and follows the topical method through- _ 
out. No text-book is used, but each pupil has constant access to the Declaration of 
Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the Articles of the State 
Constitution. 
Appended to the syllabus, in addition to the usual instructions relating to the 
teaching of the subject, are (1) a list of special terms of frequent occurrence, (2) a 
list of eminent men connected with the history of the Constitution, (3) a chronologi- 
eal table relating to the adoption of the amendments, (4) a table of parallelisms be- 
tween the Constitution and the Articles of Confederation, and (5) a list of books of 
reference recommended for the use of the teachers of the subject. In the last list 
appear: Andrew’s Manual of the Constitution of the United States, Stern’s Constitu- 
tional Historyand Political Development of the United States, Miss Dawes’s How 
We Are Governed, Alton’s Among the Law-Makers, Fiske’s American Political Ideas, 
Scott’s Development of Constitutional Liberty in the English Colonies of America, 
Frothingham’s Rise of the Republic of the United States,Greene’s Historical View of

The use of a syllabus of this kind by an intelligent teacher willing to follow the 
Beat suggestions that accompany it must result in such effective teaching that text-book 
instruction would seem dull and insipid by contrast. What good office could a 
formal text-book perform for a teacher familiar with all the literature named ? 
_. Mr. R, W. Stephenson, in his report for 1887-88, as superintendent of public in- 
struction of Columbus, Ohio, very thoroughly discussed the importance of training 
’ for citizenship, laying particular stress upon the cultivation of the virtues of obe- 
dience to rightful authority, integrity, industry, and patriotism, He would have in- 
struction also in the forms and methods of government, but he believes that the 
possession of the virtues named is more necessary to the citizen than a mere knowl- 
edge of any particular system of laws. He therefore urges that the teachers aim 
Rei ‘particularly at the inculcation of these desirable qualities in order that their pupils 
may be the better as citizens. 
In regard to this view, it may be said that the instruction recommended is only 
what is commonly called “moral training,” with aspecial and rather limited applica- 
tion, i. e., the good of the state. 
There is no difference of opinion in regard to the duty of the school to foster and cul- 
tivate all the virtues, but there is a difference of practice in regard to the incorpora- 
tion of such training with the study of politicalscience. The latter, as itis generally 
taught, aims merely at giving the pupil a knowledge of the manner in which the 
country is governed, how its officers are chosen, and what relation he himself bears to 
the conduct of public affairs. 
The cultivation of patriotism is, of course, an end in whose accomplishment the 
een study of our government is expected to aid, but that moral training which leads to 
habits of obedience and industry and integrity of character is presupposed. The 
: moral man will be moral in the exercise of his privileges and in the discharge of his 
; duties as a citizen; therefore, in most courses we find that general morality is con- 
stantly inculeated, but that no special attention is paid to political morality as sepa- 
rate from morality in all other walks of life. \

  As to the time for beginning, we find that in Denver, Washington, Detroit, East 
Saginaw, Minneapolis, Camden, Brooklyn, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia, only the 
| pupils of the eighth-year class are permitted to pursue the study. In San Francisco, 
Cal., Atchison, Kans., Lynn, Mass., and Salt Lake City, Utah, two years are given to 
the subject. In Quincy, I1]., West Des Moines, Iowa, Baltimore, Md., Lawrence, 
Mass., and Jersey City, N.J., three years. In Wichita, Kans., and New Orleans, La., 
four years. 
The time per week varies from a half hour in San Francisco, New Orleans, and Bal- 
timore, to 33 hours in Detroit and 3$ hours in Milwaukee. As a rule, the time per 
week is short where the number of weeks is great and vice versa, so that the total 
time given to the subject is remarkably uniform. i

  CHAPTER XVI. 
MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
i 
A name, says Hobbes, is a word taken at random to serve as a mark, which, being 
spoken to another, will cause the hearer to know what thought the speaker had in his 
mind when he spoke. From time to time attempts have been made to define the 
wabaning of the term manual training, but it is not improbable that the definitions 
proposed are more calculated t6 provoke than to remove doubt as to what is meant 
by that term. 
\ The New Jersey Council of Education would define ‘manual training as training 
in thought expression by other means than gesture and verbal language in such a 
carefully graded course of study as shall also provide adequate training for the judg-. 
ment and the executive faculty.” 
But this definition would seem to claim that manual training, being a method of 
expression by other means than gesture and verbal language, is a means of express- 
ing ideas by something analogous to the ancient picture writing of primeval times, 
from which the discovery of the phonetic alphabet by the Phenicians has long freed 
the civilizations of Europe.? 
On the other hand, if manual training be merely drawing disguised under another 
name, it is difficult to understand either why it should be called new? or why such a 
strong protest should be made against it ; certainly drawing has no enemies in peda- 
gogical circles. Drawing, or representation, as it is sometimes called, and ‘‘cor- 
struction,”—which is merely representation in three dimensions—have wonderful 
ower as a means of communicating the ideas of an originator or inventor to his fel- 
owmen. Itisin this way that the real artist, the architect, or the discoverer of a 
mechanical device declares his ideas to the world; and it may not be too bold to say 
that the application to industry of the generalizations of the practice of the artistis © 
what is known as industrial drawing so much in vogue now, whichis quite distinct, 
however, from mechanical drawing or drawings for the guidance of the makers of 
machinery. But painting, architecture, industrial and mechanical drawing are very 
generally recognized as valuable, which does not happen to be the case with manual 
training. 
In the last annual report of this Bureau considerable attention was given to the 
subject of manual training. The Office found itself in the singular position of having 
collected quite an array of statistics of a movement the philosophy of which as far 
as pedagogical features were involved it did not understand. The publications of 
superintendents of systems by whom statistics had been furnished were examined for 
light, but in vain, for there seemed no body of pedagogical principles that was com- 
mon to all or even a majority. There remained no way out of the dilemma but to 
study the question and to lay the results and the statistics before the public, con- 
tenting ourselves with stating and comparing rather than discussing what had been 
said upon the subject. / The results of that study, had we ventured to express a per- 
sonal view on the subject, would have been conceived in the following terms: 
“Manual training is (claimed to be) training of the judgment and executive 
faculty in a course of study in which drawing and the essential common school 
studies have also been very carefully provided for.” 
‘In a very luminous description of drawing as an art of expression, in which the 
  
1 This paper has been prepared by Mr. Wellford Addis, specialist of the Bureau. A more particular 
treatment of the subject was made by him in last year’s Report. 2See History of Ancient Art, by Perrot and Chipiez, vol. 2, p. 375 of English edition, for a highly in- teresting commentary on the ideographic characters of Egypt, China, and Chaldea. The best sum- 
mary of the results of modern research is Lenormant’s * Introduction ” to his ‘‘ Essai sur la propaga- 
tion de l’alphabet phénicien dans l’ancien monde.” ‘

peculiar conditions under which drawing is an indispensable aid to verbal language 
is shown, the ability to thin of the St. Louis Manual Training School, observes: 
    “Next to the ability to think deeply and clearly is the power of giving clear and full 
expression to our tho ghts.” a ‘ 
It is, indeed, necessary to have thought before you can clearly and fully express it. 
But the way, the modus vivendi of thinking deeply, considered purely as a method or 
abstract quality, is that teachable?” The University of Oxford seems to think so; 
for we are told by the principal and vice-chancellor of the University of Edinburgh,! 
that the English university during the present century ‘‘has made a renewed study 
of Aristotle one of its chief instruments of education, and with success, as was testi- 
fied to by the late Dr. Arnold, of Rugby.” But why Aristotle? Because, Sir A. 
Grant says, ‘‘Aristotle’s great knowledge of human nature, exhaustive class ‘ion, 
and clear methods of disentangling a question and dealing with what is essential in 
it, render many of his works an excellent curriculum for training young men, and 
fitting them for all the superior business of life.” And then our author goes on to 
account for this by saying that there is ‘‘ a certain dynamical impulse to be derived 
from Aristotle independent of all his results and conclusions” and finally defines the 
Aristotelian element in thought and knowledge as ‘‘ analytic insight,” which ‘arises 
out of concentration of the mind upon the subject in hand, marshaling together 
all the facts and opinions-upon it and dwelling on these, and scrutinizing and com- 
paring them till a light flashes on the whole subject. Such is the procedure which 
may be learned from Aristotle.” ; 
Is such the procedure that is learned by attendance ona course of manual training?    
       TRAINING OF THE EXECUTIVE FACULTY, © 
Two terms that have been used to characterize the object of manual training chal- 
Jenge attention ; these are, “the training of the executive faculty,” and the giving 
of *‘ capacities for useful action.” How to distinguish between these objects and how 
to distinguish both from the object of the course in humanities—the literae humani- 
ores of the Jesuits,—is at once such an intricate, invidious, and important task that 
it must be left to those who are conscious that they have thoroughly mastered ‘the 
question in its several features. 
But as we have not had the fortune to find an exposition of manual training 
principles which, béing made by an opponent, has commanded the respect of the 
advocates of those principles, nor a statement of those principles which, being made 
by a friend, has not been thought weak and visionary, if not worse, by the opposite 
party, it may be permitted us to step a little beyond our sphere of analysis and uar- 
rative and to offer tentatively a few ideas as to,what the expressions training of 
_ “executive faculty ” and training in ‘capacities for useful action ” really mean. In 
doing this we shall endeavor to keep constantly before us, not the inquiry ‘‘ How does 
this new theory compare with other and established theories?” but ‘Is the work, 
judged by itself and with regard only to the ideal which the worker had in his mind, 
goodor bad?” If weshall avoid any serious errors in pursuing such an undertaking, 
the happy fact is to be imputed to the simplicity of our mode of conducting it; if we 
are palpably wrong, our errors may serve as a starting point for the many distin- 
guished friends of manual training to leave somewhat vague generalities and to 
expound their principles by telling less what the public schools do not do and more 
what their principles are good for. It is known that the nanual training camp is not 
made up of homogeneous elements, and that the Hannibal that is holding them 
together is the widespread dissatisfaction with the curriculum of the public scheols 
in whole or in part. But, first, what is the executive faculty? 
In his much-landed and quoted description of Coleridge, Carlyle says: + 
“His talk, alas! was distinguished like himself by irresolution, it disliked to be 
troubled with conditions, abstinences, definite fulfilments ; loved to wander at its own 
sweet will, * * * and you were bitterly reminded of Hazlitt’s account of it. 
‘Excellent talker, very, if you let him start from no premises and come to no conclu- 
sion.’” 
This certainly is not what is meant by ‘executive power,” nor is it in any true 
sense a ‘ capacity for useful action.” Indeed, the extract is used by Dr. Carpenter in 
his Mental Psychology as an illustration of the difference between ‘ automatic ac- 
tivity and mental direction,” and Monsieur Ribot, in his monograph on the “ Diseases 
of the Will,” introduces it in the chapter on the ‘Impairment of voluntary attention,” 
to illustrate the condition even of a great mind whon it ‘‘lacks the power of direc- 
tion.” Thus we shall see,” he continues, ‘‘a perfect contrast between thought and 
will.” } * 
Not only has Monsieur Ribot devoted a chapter to the impairment of the attention

    MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 413 
in his monograph on the will, but he has devoted another monograph to the subject of 
attention itself, the work appearing by sections in the Revue Philosophique, of 
which M. Ribot is editor. The object of the monograph being ‘to establish and to 
justify the proposition that there are two very. distinct forms of attention—one spon- 
taneous or natural, the other voluntary or artificial. 
“The voluntary or artificial attention,” he says, ‘‘is a product of art, of education, 
of force of habit (entrainement), of discipline. It is grafted upon spontaneous or 
natural attention, in which it finds its conditions of existence, as the graft draws its _ 
nourishment from the trunk in which it has been inserted. In spontaneous atten- 
tion the object [attended to] acts by its own intrinsic power; in voluntary atten- 
tion the subject acts through extrinsic, that isto say, superadded powers [on the ob- 
ject]. In the latter case the end is no more a matter of chance or circumstances, it 
is willed, chosen, accepted, or at least submitted to, but it still remains for the sub- 
ject to adjust itself to that end; in a word, to find the,proper means of maintaining 
the attention. Thus this state of voluntary attention is ever accompanied by some 
feeling of effort.” 
Now we have heard of this feeling of effort before. In 1880 Prof. William James 
published an article on the subject which is standard. Within a year or two he has 
also written an article for a popular monthly under the title “‘ What the will effects,” 
in which he says— 
“Tn the volition of consent the idea which serves as motive or temptation is suffi- 
cient of itself to engender action if no other idea stands in the way. But there © 
remains a volition of effort, which seems a widely different thing. Often the idea 
which serves as our motive or reason for action seems too weak to produce action 
unless aided by.another force. Of this force we seem conscious in the effort of will 
which we have to make whenever we do a difficult thing. This seems the act of the 
will par excellence.” And a few pages further on he says, when speaking of what 
happéns when we exert our will, ‘‘ We simply fill our mind with an idea, which but 
for our effort wou!d slip away.” . 
But will our heredity let usdo this? Heredity, that Banquo-like ghost, that ever 
intrudes its repulsive presence at our educational banquets of infinite possibilities for 
the intellectual development of our own generation—our efforts to hurry up evolu- 
tion by ignoring it. But neither teacher nor preacher cares for heredity, as may be 
conclusively shown by the celebrated Drei Preussischen Regulative of 1854, “by 
which,” says Lindner, of the University of Prague, “the politico-religious party of 
Prussia, reacting on the agitation of 1848 and not content with restoring the out- 
ward conditions of things, desired to possess themselves of the public intellect, and 
consequently invaded the sphere of the Church and School.” ‘In the place of the 
theoretical,” says he briefly, ‘‘ the regulations would bave the practical; instead of 
the abstract, the concrete; instead of the individual, the historical; instead of relig- 
ious toleration, a creed; instead of empty principles for intellectual development, 
the facts given in State, Church, and Family.” As the twig is bent so is the tree 
inclined, said in substance the gentlemen who drew these regulations, which after 
allis only a way of putting Newton’s first Jaw of motion to use in sociology. 
If, then, the mind be set in motion in the right direction its vis inertie will keep it 
moving in that direction, and if the direction is in the way of learning to do by doing, it 
will not desire to lapse into idleness aiter the idea has been thoroughly inculeated 
in theschool. If the child has learned to apply himself to his school tasks he will 
be, it may be supposed, better able to overcome the feeling of effort necessary to apply 
himself to making a place for himself in the world. In all probability this is what 
the writer of a very recent and complimented book on education and heredity calls 
“suggestion. ” * 
“ The well-known effects of nervous suggestion” says this psychologist, ‘‘ operate 
upon the feelings, the intelligence, and the will. It is possible to suggest sensations, 
ideas, and volitions ; in fact, as Shakespere says, to enable one without discomfort to 
Wallow naked in December snow, By thinking on fantastic summer's heat. 
“The state of the child immediately after its birth,” our author continues, ‘is more 
or less comparable to that of a person hypnotized. There is the same absence of ideas, 
the same domination of a single passive idea. More than this, all children are hypno- 
tizable and easily bypnotizable. In short, they are particularly open to suggestion 
and to auto-suggestion. All that the child comes to know is then a suggestion, and 
this suggestion gives place to habit, which is capable of enduring throughout life, as 
we see the lasting effects produced by nurses frightening their charges.” 
Monsieur Guyau would fight hereditary habit (instinct) by suggestion. Perhaps 
even the pure manual trainingist would fight the repulsion exhibited by youth

toward systematic Seren (whether hereditary or acquired under the balefal influ- 
ences of the course of study in the public schools) by teaching them in their very 
school tasks to exert themselves physically according to a method. 
Barring the usual extravagance, engendered in all probability by carrying on the propaganda of manual training—booming it, as we Americans say,—the conscientious 
critic of the new theory for ‘ training the executive faculty ” must admit that great 
stress has been laid by the advocates of manual training on their student’s having a 
definite and—even to the childish mind—a comprehensible end in view when per- 
forming his manual tasks; and that tangible materials are given him to attain that 
end in performing the task. Now, if there is any virtue in the pedagogic maxim from 
the simple to the complex, and that maxim is convertible into the realization of an 
- idea of a complex whole by the assemblage of simple and tangible parts (a child with 
his building blocks, for instance), the theory of manual training would have one 
pedagogic leg to stand upon, at least. If this idea of a whole,—that is to say, the 
_ idea to be realized,—is one which requires not too great a call on childish imagina- 
tion (we hear a great deal about ‘‘ pussy,” etc., in the first reader), and when com- 
pleted its realization is sufficiently concrete to reward the child by enabling him to 
recognize the result of his industry, we think that in theory manual training would 
have another leg to stand on. If this, course can be graded, as suggested by Super- 
intendent Draper in the sequel, as school readers are graded, the growing intelligence 
of the child. can be constantly accommodated and his hands occupied in working out 
his ideas, thereby gaining dexterity and becoming obedient to his will. 
But what is his will to be made obedient to during this course in which (in theory) 
he is taught to impress himself on matter and in which he may find out by instruc- 
tion, what many find out for themselves, that he can impress himself on matter and 
even on his weaker fellow-men (Aristotelized Oxford graduates for instance)? ‘‘We 
do not neglect the humanities,” say the manual trainingists in response. ‘Our man- 
ual ene (high) schools are good secondary schools,” says Director Woodward of 
St. Louis. 
Our using the foregoing quotations like so many chessmen may remind the learned 
reader of the story told of Zeno, the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy, who 
after having successively enrolled himself as a disciple of the different philosophers 
of Athens, but before formulating his own theory, presented himself as a pupil to 
Polemo, who responded, ‘‘I am no stranger to your Phoenician arts, Zeno.” But our 
purpose must not be misunderstood. It is not that we may cull out a theory for 
manual training that we have spoken so frequently between quotation marks, but 
-because we desire to represent pro tempore on what scientific principles a manual 
trainingist might possibly base his theory; and we shall be more than pleased if, 
in our suppositive argument we have not suggested to him Laocoén’s remark about 
the Grecian horse at Troy : ‘‘ Quiequid id est, timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.” 
CAPACITIES FOR USEFUL ACTION. 
But does Lord Armstrong’s taking term, ‘‘ capacities for useful action,”! cover the 
same thing as the ‘‘ executive faculty?” It would certainly seem so if the attention is 
confined to the expression wherein, speaking of his commercial republic of 13,000 
men and boys, he says, ‘I can affirm with confidence that had I acted upon the prin- 
ciple of choosing men for their knowledge rather than their ability, I should have 
been surrounded by an incomparably less efficient staf’ than that which now governs 
the Elswick Works.” { 
Yet he means something more than this, for “ not only should the mind be trained 
to habits of thought, and in quickness and accuracy of perception, but the hand, the 
eye, and the ear should all participate in training exercises calculated to make these 
organs more available as instruments of mind,” He thinks thatif the thief-trainer can 
cause the hand of his pupil to acquire such dexterity as to enable it to empty your pock- 
ets without your knowing it, that honesty should have the benefit of the same acquir- 
able deftness of execution. But Lord Armstrong has no more thought of advocating 
the teaching of a trade in the public schools when urging the training for capacities 
for useful action than he would have, under any possible combination of affairs, of 
advocating a kindergarten like that conducted by the amiable Mr. Fagin, the so- 
called ‘‘Jew” in Mr. Dickens’s novel of Oliver Twist. 
“Tf,” he says, ‘‘if in cultivating the hand’s mobility, precision, and delicacy of 
touch, the ability to use simple todls were acquired, it would be advantageousin any 
line of life that might ultimately be adopted; * * * but toattempt to teach chil- 
dren special trades and processes of manufacture would, I conceive, be a mistake.” 
Thus there appears to be something more palpably utilitarian in this training for 
capacities for useful action—the training of the hand and eye of the manual train-

ingists—than the training of “the executive faculty.” It would seem that capacities 
for useful action stand in the same relation to the main object of manual training as 
the counting-house value of arithmetic stands to arithmetic as the science of num- 
bers and all that that abstract science implies as an’ instrument of mental develop- 
ment. In both cases, unfortunately, there is a popular tendency to view the inci- 
dentalas themain feature. | | ‘ 
Such we venture to think is what is meant by the executive faculty which is to be 
' trained and by the training for capacity for useful action or training of the agents of 
the mind to be the mind’s very obedient and humble servants. 
ANOTHER DEFINITION OF MANUAL TRAINING. 
The complaint of Shakespeare’s Richard that, after all his exertions, there was still 
another Richmond in the field, must be echoed by him who would keep the run of : 
manual training arguments. 
In May, 1887, the legislature of Pennsylvania provided for the appointment of a 
commission of five, who held their first meeting in December, 1887, and have within 
a few days published their very comprehensive report.! Of this report the third and 
fourth pages call for the best attention we can give them. The discussion of the 
meaning of the term manual training on those pages opens thus: 
“Tt is, perhaps, desirable to indicate the sense in which the terf industrial educa- 
tion is here used. In recent discussions the terms ‘technical education,’ ‘scientific 
education,’ ‘industrial education,’ ‘manual training,’ ete., frequently occur, and it is 
doubtful whether a clear distinction as to the field they cover is always-held in mind 
by those using them. It is, perhaps, impossible that such a distinction may be 
made in a way to meet the approval of all educators, but the view upon which the 
commission has proceeded, which has given direction and coloring to all its inves- 
tigations, and which has embodied itself in the conclusions presented in this report, 
may be stated substantially as follows: 
“Scientific education [the physical, including chemical, and the mathematical 
sciences and their application to industry ?] may be regarded in one view as almost 
exclusively theoretical; in another, as almost exclusively practical ; this being the 
familiar distinction between pure and applied science. Butsince no branch of science 
ean be effectively taught, except as to its theory, without the aids of the laboratory 
and the actual manipulation of materials and apparatus, all scientific instruction 
comes to have, almost of necessity, a semitechnical cast [such, for instance, as the 
civil engineering or chemistry course in a college?] If carried one step further and: 
conducted with reference to its general applications to industry [as in the Shef- 
field Scientific School of Yale?], it becomes a general technical instruction; if 
applied to specific industries [a European weaving or an American agricultural 
school?], it bécomes a special technical or technological instruction.” : 
Technical instruction, then is, say the commission, the teaching of science with 
specific reference to its industrial applications, and, as a term, is almost universally 
‘Applied to the higher ranges of such instruction, while industrial instruction ‘may 
properly be considered applicable to the lower ranges. Then taking up the term 
manual training, they discuss it thus: 
“‘Manual training, in the strict sense of the term, would mean simply the training 
of the hand, but as currently used with reference to education the words indicate 
such employment of the hand as will at the same time train the eye to accuracy and 
the mind to attention. The scientific element, or the teaching of science pure and 
simple, is not necessarily involved inthe expression. As, however, pure science can 
scarcely be taught without locking somewhat towards its applications, so manual 
training can not be made an effective educational process, except by constant refer- 
ence to the broad’ foundation in the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences upon 
which it rests.” 
Thecommission, therefore, deem that the term “industrial education” “involves both 
the idea of manual training with reference to its industrial applications, and the idea 
of educational or intellectual training, which, with reference to industries, must be 
largely on the scientific side;” and they understand the term and use it as meaning 
primarily education ; education with reference to practical life, but still education; 
“the training of the hand, the eye, and the brain to work in unison; the training of

In our last report chap. xv, the propaganda, the curricu- Jum, and the statistics of mannal training as we understand the term, wero treated for the first time seriously, But the commission have not attempted to digest but have contented themselves with arranging (by States) thevery complete information their dilizence procured. If the reader desires to put himself into possession of the facts and theories on the subject of mannal and industrial training, he should secure not only the two works already Schoenhof’s recent report on ‘‘Lechnical Educaion in France,” published by the State Department at Washington, and Circular No, 2, 1889, of this Bureau.

the whole child in such a doi that his inward powers may act effectively through fit 
instruments upon his external surroundings, and receive from them accurate and 
informing impressions.” The commission does not wish to appear as a critic, much 
less as an opponent of the public schools, <‘ but the widespread introduction of scien- 
tific knowledge and scientific methods into all the industrial processes of the day, 
makes it necessary that the great mass of our children who leave the school at the 
age of fourteen or sixteen, if they are not to be launched unprepared into an unknown 
world, must acquire such training in the public school as will give them at, least 
some elementary knowledge of the facts and the forces with which they will be 
brought face to face as soon as the doors of the schoolhouse shall close upon them ;” 
for, says one of “our friendliest and most judicious critics: ‘Too large a class of 
young people in America, of both sexes, are seeking pursuits not requiring manual 
lJabor.’” mis. if 
All this is quite in a line with Mr. Herbert Spencer’s plan of education, and it cer- 
tainly is not “training” as opposed to “knowledge.” And as Lord Armstrong, in 
his ‘‘Cry for Useless Knowledge,” says that workshops and factories where actual 
business is carried on are the proper schouls for the learning of trades and industries, 
so it may be said that the place for learning the facts aud forces of the world with 
which the child is brought face to face is in the school of the world, not in the public 
school, though it may be perfectly legitimate to use the public school to give the 
child the capacities for useful action which go by the name of industry, patience, and 
determination to meet the facts and forces of the unknown world when he is launched 
into it—if public or any other school life can. While Professor Woodward and 
others, therefore, claim that manual training can give theso or other equally essential 
qualities, their arguments and facts will receive an intelligent and a sympathetic 
consideration that must command their respect, though our neutr: in the propa- 
ganda may not meet with their entire approval. 
Speculating upon these matters we have examined carefully the information that is 
annually arriving, to see whether manual training in theory is drifting towards in- 
dustrial or technological education, or is filling an imputed lacuna in the develop- 
ment of the child left by the usual literary course of the schools. The attempt is 
difficult under any circumstances, but the difficulties are. intensified when an attempt 
is made to balance the record year by year. . It requires historical retrospect to strike 
such a balance. ‘ 
      
THE MANUAL-TRAINING COURSE SHOULD BE A GRADED COURSE, AND IT IS NECESSARY TO 
f BEGIN AT THE LOWER END OF IT. | 
Under the head of ‘industrial instruction” the State saperintendent of New York 
remarks that the experiences of all lands are being eagerly inquired after and put 
forward as aids to a satisfactory conclusion, and that naturally wide differences of 
opinion, even in the opinion of persons best qualified to judge, are being devel- 
oped. Extravagant assertion and intemperate argument are frequently advanced 
to sustain criticism and suggestions which lack a more substantial foundation. Yet 
all this arouses a spirit of inquiry and creates a movement toward a higher plane and 
in more practical directions. There is a sentiment abroad that insists that the time 
of the schools shall not be wasted in nonessentials, and that the school course from 
kindergarten to university shall be an interdependent and well-codrdinated whole. 
“Besides this there is a most decided and determined movement in the direction of 
practical affairs and everyday employments. Kindergarten ee molding in clay, 
modeling in sand, studying the forms of objects and delineating those forms upon 
paper, the cultivation of the industrial and decorative arts, and the use of mechancal 
tools have come to be recognized as things which stand in a progressive relationship 
to each other, as work which cultivates boys and girls more broadly and completely, 
~ which assists rather than interferes with their purely literary and mathematical edu- 
cation, and which consequertly has a legitimate place in the curriculum of the 
school.” j 
. It is believed, however, Mr. Draper continues, that this practical course will have 
a telling influence on the school work of the future more speedily if the futility of 
commencing at the wrong end is recognized. With characteristic impetuosity there 
is too much tendency to jamp at conclusions. ‘‘To put carpenters’ tools even under 
the direction of a practical carpenter into the hands of a boy who has not had his ob- 
serving and perceptive faculties sharpened, and whose hand has not been trained to 
dexterity by the earlier processes in the industrial course, is not very unlike trying to 
teach him history before he can read understandingly. The time will be wasted. “Tt 
will not make hira a carpenter, for time and facilities are not eq ual to it. It will not 
promote his intellectual education, for it will have no foundation to rest upon,”

    NO DISTINCTION POSSIBLE IN NEW YORK CITY BETWEEN PEDAGOGIC BRANCHES AND 
MANUAL-TRAINING BRANCHES. . 
iu our last Report, at page 859, it was only possible to give a meager account of 
the introduction of manual training into the public schools of the city of New York. 
he report of the city superintendent had not yet arrived, nor did it arrive until 
October, 1889. Using this report we find the following interesting information which 
would have added very materially to the remarks of our last Report and supple- 
mented the New York course of study given on pages 853-856 of the same volume. 
This highly interesting method of instruction,” says the city superintendent, “ has 
been pursued in twenty schools and departments during the last year [1888]. The 
sl number of pupils in these schools and departments is about 10,000, and steadily, 
»fulty, and encouragingly have these children worked in the course mapped out 
che board of education. Owing to the shortness of the period during which the 
eriment has been tried, it would be unwise to express a definite opinion in regard 
» the future of manual training. From present appearances, however, it is certain 
t the children have a love for it and their parents have a keen appreciation of its 
antages. * * * All the branches of this course of study are thriving, and there 
an important point—all the branches, separation of them being impossible. People 
ho dream of pedagogic branches and manual-training branches in the same department 
as separate and unrelated things have not yet grasped the subject. The manual of 
this course of study has been so arranged that all the branches of education are inter- 
woven in such a manner as to make a distinction impossible. Manual training does 
not mean merely the training of the hand; it means the training of our every 
facalty.” 
    
THE COMMUNITY NEEDS TO BE EDUCATED OUT OF THE ABSURD IDEA THAT THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS CAN BE MADE SHOPS FOR TEACHING TRADES, 
The superintendent of Paterson, N.J., in his last report speaks of the false view of 
manual training taken by the public. 
The scope of the work proposed in manual training was such as to lead, I think, 
to an overestimate of the result possible when the conditions under which our 
schools labor are taken into consideration. Many people supposed that we were to 
hwith begin the teaching of trades—carpentering, blacksmithing, brass-working, 
, for the boys, and for the girls dress-making, bread-making, and many other 
she accomplishments desirable in the female sex. It should be understood that 
manual training in its intended application to our schools does not embrace the 
teaching of a trade, and moreover that a single year is not sufficient to show our 
elaborate application of the manual-training feature in public education. Diffieul- 
ties are to be met and overcome in adjusting the ordinary work of the school to the 
new conditions imposed by the incorporation of manual instruction. The community 
needs to be educated to such an extent in the ethics of the ‘new departure’ as to 
create a bond of sympathy. Once let it be demonstrated that the boys and girls of 
schools not only need not sacrifice the traditional studies of the schools, but that 
nual training gives a zest to them—is not only manual but also intellectual in its 
come—and we shall be enabled to take further steps in finding time and place for 
s pursuit. We have accomplished quite as much as ought to have been expected 
th the means at our command. It may be deemed unfortunate that the heralding 
{ its introduction, to the limited extent that has been possible with us, should excite 
h exaggerated anticipations. We shall eventually adjust our conditions to meet 
reasonable demands of manual instruction. Its incorporation in the work of the 
ools has enlisted the best thought of eminent educators, and time and experiment 
vill render the verdict. We have merely made a beginning.” 
      
  A DOUBT ON PECUNIARY GROUNDS. 
The question as to the good resulting from an education in manual training in ad- 
dition to the present course of study is open to argument, says the president of the 
Hoboken Board of Education, where manual training has been tried 3 years. One of 
the principal objections against it seems to be that it will divert attention from a 
vurse of study which is developing the child’s natural faculties. The enthusiasm 
of the pupils for the work he is inclined to attribute to its novelty. He adds, how- 
ever, that the board of trustees of the industrial education of New Jersey report 
that’ the system of manual training is working harmoniously and effectively, and 
claim that it will soon be regarded as an indispensable adjunct of our public-school 
tem. ‘This, however, is a matter which, with its costs and relative good, is as 
yet an unknown quantity.”

| BDUCATION REPORT, 1! 
  OF A MANUAL-TRAINING 
    
  
The remarks of the superintendent of Boston in his report for 1889 are interesting, 
to say the least, though, as far as he has expresse himself, not in accord with the 
notes sane for manual training as an intellectual discipline. He would specialize 
the work. : a 
4 On the 14th of February the school committee received a communication from the 
ee city council conveying the request that the school committee would “ consider and 
u report on the expediency of establishing a system of manual training in connection 
_ with the public schools of the city.” The superintendent urges the committee to 
respond by declaring it ‘‘ expedient, as the best beginning in the establishment of a 
system of manual training, that one thoroughly equipped mechanic-arts high school 
be established,” a proposition urged by him in his report for 1883, when the school of 
4 mechanic arts in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the St. Louis Man- 
ne ual Training School were the ‘‘ only two schools of the kind in the whole country,” 
, though now “‘ such schools have been established in Baltimore, Philadelphia, Cleve- 
land, Toledo, and other cities.” i 
The body of experience, therefore, to which appeal may be made in illustrating 
the advantages of manual training as a branch of publie instruction, being so con- 
siderable, the superintendent confidently refers to it as substantiating the following 
conclusions which we take the liberty of giving in a summarized form : 
14, That a school on the St. Louis plan resnlis in a high degree of mechanical intel- 
ligence, a good degree of general mechanical skill, ‘and a well-marked development 
i in the power of independent thinking.” 
8 2. It takes hold on a large class of boys who are not touched or not so thoroughly 
touched by the current methods in the older high schools. 
3. That it relieves the pressure on the high school and attracts those that néver 
% enter them. 
4. Thatits work is interesting to the boy, its bearing being recognized, and ‘brings 
their executive powers into productive activity.” 
5. That it is up to a certain point an excellent and improved form of apprenticeship. 
6. That it is a preparatory school for technological schools, 
7-10, That the instruction is popular, capable of boing given to classes in a school, 
and therefore of being made a part of the public-school system of a large city, and 
finally that its cost is in keeping with the cost of any other high school. 
The school should be called a high school to mark its place in the public-school 
system and its relation to the grammar schools. It should be called a mechanic-arts ~ 
school to mark its special aim and the characteristic aim of its course of instruction. 
    THE RESULTS OF MANUAL TRAINING NOT TO BE LOOKED FOR IN THE OBJECT MADE, 
BUT IN THE FORMATION OF CHARACTER. 
«That bodily training must be associated closely with mental training in the pro- 
Auction of the useful men and women of the future, I am more than ever firmly con- 
vinced,” says the superintendent of Jamestown, N. Y., where manual training was 
jntroduced in 1877, ‘I believe that even in tho immature stage in which we are 
now observing manual work, if we will look for results, not in the objects made by 
the hand, but in the character of the youthful worker, we shall be able to see signs 
of the best results. And with this, the only true spirit and purpose of the industrial 
education in view, I would earnestly impress upon ‘the board the necessity for the 
better nee support of a department which all have acknowledged io be vitally 
essential. ' { 
HAND WORK, AS A MEANS OF MENTAL DEVELOPMENT, A SUCCESS. 
In 1883, says the school committee of Brookline, Mass., an industrial vocation of 
carpentry selool was established in Brookline, in deference “to what seemed to be al 
i growing public demand.” It was an experiment to.answer the question, Would boy: 
of grammar-school age have the physical and mental matarity to profit by such in. 
} _' struction? Six experimental years convinced the committee “that the teaching o: 
hand work as a laboratory exercise, and as a means of mental development, had bee: 
successful.” An experimental course for girls in sewing and cooking was also success! 
ful, Finally, when the pupils of one school were transferred to a new one in whic’ 
rovision had been made for “industrial education,” & new programme was estab 
ished by which all pupils twelve years of age and over should have ‘‘six hours o: 
hand studies per week,” and to the others four hours a week out of the twenty-five 
«The aim in the hand studies has not been to produce the largest manual results, bu, 
to determine the best methods for making this work the most effective as an intelle 
tual discipline.”

MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. — 419° 
_GROUNDS ON WHICH MANUAL TRAINING HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN INDIANAPOLIS, 
Speaking of the important step taken during the year in preparing the way for a 
course of instruction in manual education, the city superintendent says that much 
discussion has been had in recent years among those interested directly in educa- 
tional work over the question of the place and value of manual education in the 
school curriculum, and still the question seems somewhat unsettled, even in the 
minds of those who have given most time to its consideration. The grounds upon 
which the superintendent based his recommendation may be briefly stated as follows: 
1. It is believed that such study will havea general tendency to give pupils a prac- 
tical turn or habit of thought, and to direct, in a common-sense way, their attention 
to the possibilities that are always open to intelligent workers in mechanical and 
industrial pursuits. * * * j 
2. It is believed that such course of instruction will develop the executive power 
of the pupil and thereby make him a more capable worker in any kind of work in 
which he may afterwards engage. 
3,4. It will serve as physical training and as an outlet for ‘some of the natural 
sense of power to do which the average boy possesses, and which by ordinary school 
work is repressed rather than cultivated.” 
5. The discipline, though not distinctively better than that now given by the 
schools, is different from if, and stands as its necessary complement. 
THE CHILD’S EXECUTIVE FACULTY HAS BEEN TRAINED. 
The superintendent of the schools of Minneapolis, in diseussing the question of 
manual training, observes that the experience of his system in the matter of incor- 
porating manual training into the regular public-school work ‘ has probably been 
larger than that of any other large city,” and discusses the value of the work in these 
terms: ' 
“A little piece of work produced by a boy who had been three months in the man- 
ual-training department was brought tomy desk one day. It. consisted of three pieces 
of hard wood mortised and locked together with great dexterity and exactness. I 
was told that it would do credit to a skilled workman. Now, what had this youth 
learned during his three months in the workshop? [The superintendent then enum- 
erates the knowledge and skill attained.] But far more important than these vis- 
ible results is the influence upon a boy’s habits of thought and fundamental traits 
of character. This youth has not substituted manual training for mental training. 
He has added the education of the hand and at the same time given direction and 
a new force te his mental activities. His judgment and his executive faculty have 
found a new field and a new motive for action.” 
THE EDUCATIVE VALUE OF COOKERY. 
During the year 1838-89 the board of education of Milwaukee adopted the exper- 
iment until then conducted by the ladies of the Milwaukee Cooking School Associa- 
tion. These ladies had obtained from the board the use of a room in the seventh 
district school in which to conduct a series of lessons in practical cooking. “ 
“At the beginning of the present school year the work was given a new impetus 
under circumstances still more favorable and encouraging. Sufficient time has 
elapsed during this term to enable me [the superintendent] to speak emphatically in 
behalf of this department of education, . . A visit to the public school kitchen 
during any one of the lessons will convey to the patient observer abundant proof 
that the work is valuable in two aspects. It is educational as well as useful. It is’ 
in fact manual training for girls. As the fundamental part of this art includes all 
those general phenomena relating to combustion, to the atmosphere, the effects of 
heat upon water, it may be easily seen that the course of instruction is, in one re- 
spect, good training in scientific demonstration. Of course much of the demonstra- 
tion is empirical and many things have to be taken for granted; but aside from this 
there are abundant opportunities for the cultivation of the observing faculties in the 
application of physics and chemistry in cooking. 
ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MATERNAL VIEWS ON COOKING AS A PUBLIC SCHOOL STUDY, 
As cooking is one of the branches of manual training for females, and as it is fre- 
' quently urged that manual training should be introduced to satisfy the public demand, 
it is peculiarly appropriate that (as was recently done in New Haven, ont, after one 
course of lessons had been given) a note of inquiry should be sent to the mother of

each pupil requesting an opinion as to results. Replies were received in the case of 
New Haven from upwards of one hundred and ten persons, as follows: 
Question 1.— What degres of interest has your daughter shown in these lessons? 
One hundred replies indicate a high degree of interest; 7 reply that no interest was taken; 2 speak 
doubtfully. ‘The usual answer was, ‘‘groat interest,” ‘‘remarkable interest,” “‘unusual interest,” 
etc. One answers ‘100 per cent.” Another ‘‘an interest that will last a lifetime.” 
uestion 2.—Has she shown a new interest in household duties at home? — 
Snety-two answered in the aférmative; 14 answered in the negative; 1 said her daughter was inter- 
ested only in the cooking. * 
‘Question 3.-- What estimate do you place upon. such teaching in respect to its educational value? 
Ninety-eight speak emphatically in its favor; 7 are in doubt. i 
Question 4.—Would you recommend making such a course of lessons a regular part of the common 
school course? i I 
Ninety-two would favor it—many of these urge it strongly; 4 would make it an optional branch; 11 
are not in favor of it. ! 420

Tn certain countries of the East where the sempiternal heat: is apt to ripen uneleanli- 
ness into pestilence daily ablations have become a part of the religious ceremonies 
of the people. In colder climates where one-half of the year is spent in preparing 
for the necessities of the other the value of manual labor in some form is universally 
recognized and insisted upon. The English premier recently said that the first neces- 
sity of man is to live and his first duty is to work. ‘ 
The idea that children should be taught to labor is by no means new on this side of 
the Atlantic. In 1642 the general court of Massachusetts, after ordaining that the 
children of the colony should be taught to read, further provided “ that all parents 
and masters do breed and bring up their children and apprentices in some honest 
lawful calling, labor, oremployment, or some other trade profitable for themselves 
and the commonwealth, if they will not nor can not train them up in learning to fit 
* them for higher employments.” 
By this law the literary and industrial training of the child was imposed on the 
head of the family. Another law was passed in 1647, however, enjoining the estab- 
lishment of schools, from which it may be inferred, as Mr. Philbrick justly remarks, 
that the function of schoolmaster was not being performed by the head of the family 
upon whom the earlier law had imposed it as a duty. In our day the apprenticeship 
system is said to be a thing of the past, and it seems that there are many who main- 
tain that the parent who has already been relieved by the public of the burden 
of educating his child should also be relieved of the burden of eine thee the child 
be taught a vocation now that an age of machinery has taken from him the ancient 
recourse of ‘ binding the child out.” : 
Although those who advocate the use of the public schools as apprentice shops are 
by far the most numerous, there is another party who, observing the effect of tru- 
ant, protective, and even reform schools on waifs and petty rogues, would seem to 
view the whole body of children in the public schools as such unfortunates and, apply- 
ing the industrial principle of the various classes of institutions we have named to the 
public schools, would correct the evil effect, as they say, of a course of study in them by 
teaching the pupil a trade. There seem to be others still who, seeing how unevenly 
wealth isdivided, would make the matter of educating the poor a sort of compen- 
sating charge on the rich. 
Among school men there are many who favor industrial training because they 
think that the teaching of a trade will detain the pupil in the school since the usual 
motive for leaving has thus been removed. i 
a 
MANUAL LABOR MOVEMENT OF 1830. 
By 1830 the noise of Fellenberg’s experiment at Hofwyl had caused quite an active 
agitation in America for manual labor as an adjunct, a yery essential adjunct as was 
claimed, of literary work in an educational institution. ‘The first notice (as far as we 
are aware) of the work at Hofwyl was the account published by Professor Griscom 
of the New York High School, who visited Fellenberg’s institution in 1818 or 1819. 
But the principal source of information seems to have been a series of letters in the 
Annals of Education for 1830 and 1831, written by the editor, W. C. Woodbridge, 
who had resided at Hofwy! at different times for ‘nine months.” 
Under the circumstances it may be quite appropriate te speak of the Hofwyl ex- 
eriment. In doing this we can not attempt to draw from Hamm’s biography of 
Fellenberg in German, but will simply translate a portion of the article “ Fellenberg” 
jn Buisson’s Dictionnaire de Pédagogie, which is much better and more to the point 
than the articles we have seen in other pedagogical encyclopedias : ! 
“1. Fellenberg founded (1804) in the first place a practical school of agriculture 
and of work for the poor in order to prepare a generation of workmen at once stronger 
  iW ff  
-P-A-G-E-493
    MANUAL AND INDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 421 
and more adroit, more hardened to work, and more disciplined in their conduct than 
was at that time customary among day workmen.! 
“2. Three years later, in 1807, he created the higher institute of agronomy for the 
scientific training of young persons whose business it would be in after life to direct 
agricultural operations. The superabundance of students, mostly foreigners and full- 
grown men, obliged Fellenberg to restrict the admission to pupils who had been edu- 
cated at Hofwyl, Almost all the analogous institutions in Switzerland and Europe 
owe their origin to Fellenberg’s experiment. 
«3, In 1808 he opened at Hofwyl a course for elementary school teachers. 
“4, A school which completed the school founded in 1804 and which has been 
mentioned under 1 above. 
“5, When his older sons had arrived at an age proper for classical instruction 
(Vinstruction classique) he joined with them several young people of wealth (gens 
d’élite), chosen from among the students of the institution and confided them all to ~ 
excellent professors. Thus was formed the celebrated higher school of scientific edu- 
cation, where subsequently so many princes and grand seignors learned to exchange 
ae caey life and egoism for the pleasures of the mind, of knowing, and of affectionate 
iberality. 
“6, To furnish to the citizen class the intellectual resources proper for an indus- 
trial or commercial career, he organized a Realschule upon which he proposed to 
graft a normal school, 
“7, An institution for girls. 
“8, An infant school. 
“9, An industrial or professional school for agriculture.” 
In crossing the ocean European ideas seem to suffer a sea-change into something if 
not exactly rich still quite strange. Fellenberg’s idea was seized upon here as the 
means of preparing ministers for the gospel by the clergy, as a substitute for gym- 
nastics by the hygienists; as practical by those who believe that ‘the first duty 
of man isto work.” ‘It furnished exercise adapted to interest the mind.” ‘Its moral 
effect would be peculiarly happy.” ‘‘ It would promote habits of industry, independ- 
ence of character, and originality.” ‘‘It would be adapted to render permanentall the 
manlier features of character and to afford facilities to the student in acquiria; 
a knowledge of human nature.” ‘‘It would increase the wealth of the country ad 
tend to do away with those absurd distinctions in society which make the occupa- 
tion of an individual the standard of his worth and would also render permanent 
our republican institutions.” 2 
As far as we know, and we make no pretense to have ransacked libraries and odd 
corners for information, the first schoolof the literary and manual labor kind was the 
Maine Wesleyan Seminary located at Readfield. About 1820 Mr. Elihu Robinson, 
together with Mr. Luther Sampson, of Readfield, ‘‘formed the design of an institu- 
tion in which manual labor should be united with study. ‘‘This plan was communi- 
cated to a few of their friends, and of the friends of literature, who soon became 
deeply interested in the project from the following considerations: That many of 
our most worthy young men through poverty Were deprived of the advantages of an 
education; that many of those who were favored with those advantages, for wantof 
proper motives to industry, became the abject subjects of idleness and dissipation ; 
and that many others, who seemed the special favorites of genius, for want of some 
regular systematic exercise, were doomed to find an early grave. Thesystem, which 
had for its object to remedy these evils, became fully matured as early as the year 
1824, and went into successful operation in the spring of 1825. With the literary 
establishment there was connected a farm of 140 acres on which are employed [the 
puneieal is writing at the date of 1830] twelve or fifteen students. There was soon 
erected a mechanical shop in which there are employed about thirty-five students. 
To furnish the means of labor in both these departments there has already been in- 
vested capital to the amount of about $3,000. The principal branches carried on in 
our mechanical department are chairmaking, cabinetwork, turning, sashmaking, 
toolmaking, coopering, and blockmaking. The shoemaking business was pursaed 
till it was found to be decidedly unfavorable to the health of those employed.” 
The next institution—the Oneida Institute of Science and Industry*—was opened in 
1827 and incorporated by the board of regents of the University of New York in 1829. 
“The course of instruction,” says the Rev. Mr. Gale, a teacher in the institution, 
‘given here is the same as that pursued in the best academies and high schools in

  EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. ‘ Bal 
  our country, A great part of the students are preparing for the higher classes at 
college, others for a theological seminaty. The peculiarity | f this institution is the 
system of exercise adopted. This consists of manual labor 3 hours each day, in the 
garden, on the farm, or in a mechanic’s shop, working in wood; and the labor is 
under such supervision and control as to make it at the same time a system of exer- 
cise and.a means of support to the student. * * * The systemof exercise is popu- 
lar. * * * It was thought by many that young men pursuing study would not 
labor, and that parents would not be willing to send their sons to such an institution. ’ 
Experience with us has shown that neither of these is true. Five hundred applica- 
tions more than could be received were make to us last yea and in the same propor- 
tion have they been made the present year, although pains have been taken to in- 
form the public that the institute is full. Many of these have been from the best 
families both in the country and city. So strongly are our students attached to this 
system, that were the offer of gratuitous support at ae {that is, by nonmanual 
labor institutions ?] made few would accept it.” The gentleman then speaks of its 
effect ‘‘in reducing expenses,” in ‘ preserving health,” in “securing good habits,” and 
of how ‘favorable it is to piety,” but we may not follow his line of argument. At 
the date of 1832 there were at least 8 schools of this kind ip operation in New Eng- 
Jand, the Middle States, and the West. Haat 
It is very evident that the ideas of the time were too coarse to have the conception 
of ‘manual training” asnow advocated. On the other hand, ascompared with a trade 
school whose function is to educate for a special kind of work, the manual labor 
movement of 1830 was, to a great extent, working to pay the expenses of an education, 
at least to reduce those expenses. Pie 
In the West instruction in agriculture was added by the legislatures to their normal 
universities established during the fifties. But the great impetus was given by the 
Congressional land grant of 1962 to aid in the establishment of colleges of agricul- 
ture and mechanic arts, all of which has been too well canvassed in the past to 
need discussion here.! , , 
THE PHILOSOPHY OF MANUAL LABOR IN SCHOOLS FOR TIME SPECIAL CLASSES, 
The first institution—with singular impropriety called an ‘‘asylum established 
in the western world for the education of the special class of persons whom nature, 
disease, or accident has deprived of one of the faculties usually possessed by man, ~ 
was the ‘American Asylum at Hartford for thé Education and Instraction of the 
Deaf and Dumb.” it 
In turning over the time-stained leaves of the early reports of the directors of this 
school we find that the fourth contains so full an account of the motives that in- 
duced them to introduce manual labor into their school, thus establishing a prece- 
dent, that it may not be amiss to dwell upon it. i 
The school was established in 1817, and in 1820 we find the directers saying that 
from the situation of the school in the heart of the city, ‘it has hitherto been des- 
titute of those accommodations for horticultural and mechanical employments which 
it has always been the wish and intention of the directors to provide. For while 
they feel the high responsibility which is laid upon them of providing for the im- 
provement of the pupils in useful human knowledge, and above all for their instruc- 
tion in the way of salvation, they are convinced that this knowledge will take the 
deepest root, and this instruction make the most lasting impression in the minds of 
those who are preserved, when out of school, from absolute indolence on the one 
hand and from an excess of recreation on the other, by some manual labor propor- 
tioned always, both in kind and degree, to the ability of the individual who is to 
perform it and to the wishes of his parents or friends. Such labor should consti- 
tute an essential part of all judicious systems of education for youth, and pre-em- 
inently so when they are assembled together in considerable numbers in large 
establishments. It forms those habits of energetic industry and that state of sound, 
podily health, and that check upon irregularity and idleness which are the foundation 
of ali correct moral instruction and discipline. Besides, labor of the hands, in some 
form or other, will probably afford to many of the pupils the only means of their 
future support after leaving the asylum.” 4 
With these views the directors purchased seven acres of land and were erecting “a 
capacious and convenient building of brick.” ‘‘ Here,” continues the report, ‘‘it is the 
' intention of the ghee introduce such horticultural and mechanical employ- 
ments among the pupils, under suitable regulations, adapted to the peculiar situation 
and prospects of ac as will furnish all with some useful and healthy 
exercise out of school hours, and those who are poor with such habits ot industry as 
will enable them to be in the way of procuring a future livelihood. ‘To what extent

these employments may be carried, how much they may, at a future time, contribute 
to the support of indigent pupils at the asylum, and how far the complete knowledge 
of some useful art or trade may be imparted, while the intellectual [the italics are 
ours] and religious instruction is going on, are subjects on which the directors do 
not feel able at present to decide.” In the eighth report we come upon a familiar 
expression,” ‘preparation for the active duties of life.” The shops have been com- 
pleted “at a considerable pecuniary sacrifice on the part of the institution.” This 
was made, however, ‘‘in hopes that the way might thus be prepared for meeting the 
wishes of the public and of the friends of the deaf and dumb [the italics are ours] with 
regard to this very interesting and important part of their education and preparation 
for the active duties of life.” s ‘ 
Now it would be interesting to know what idea the directors and the public had in 
those days ofa “ preparation for the active duties of life.” This would be shown by 
the instruction they provided for the pupil. Fortunately for our inquiry the report 
contains several ‘‘ specimens of original composition” by the pupils, one of which is 
‘a description of the workshops of the asylum,” and although this falls between a! 
letter from Marcus Tullius Cicero toa ‘‘ friendin Greece,” and another from Napoleon 
Bonaparte from his retirement atSt. Helena to “Maria Louisa, his wife,” the descrip- 
tion of the workshops contains internal evidence of genuineness not possessed by the 
other two. This original composition runs as follows: Lai, 
“The two workshops, which are northwest of the asylum, are about 200 feet from 
it. They are built of brick. Ithink that they are both about forty by sixteen, They 
haye one story anda garret. When strangers and visitors come to those shops, they 
are, I think, interested to see things which are made by the male pupils. Thecabinet- 
maker, who can speak and hear, saw in the newspaper last February that the direct- 
ors of the American Asylum wished to have a suitable person to oversee the work- 
shops and to instruct several pupils who wished to be cabinetmakers. He came here 
this month and is employed to overlook and aid in business. Six male pupils in the 
left shop make new family furniture to sell in the city. A cooper in thag same shop 
makes barrels, pails, tubs, and keelers [a shallow tub]. A deafand dumb mature 
gentlemen, who is from Maine, isa very skillful and ingenious blacksmith and cutler 
in the right-hand shop. ee made a great many new blades from cast steel, he 
puts them in the old handles,’ One blade costs fifteen cents, and the people are very 
much astonished to see that it is very cheap. His apprentices are employed to learn 
the business of a blacksmith and cutler. A deafand dumbshoemaker, who was from 
the State of New York, makes elegant shoes for the ladies from morocco, kid, pru- 
nello, seal, and Denmark satin.” : 
In 1827 we are told that increased attention is being bestowed upon the mechanical 
department of the institution, most of the pupils having employed four or five hours 
daily in learninga trade. Experience, however, had by that time fully demonstrated 
that such work could not be made to pay for its expenses. 
Turning now to the institutions for the blind we find the trustees of the Perkins 
Institution in their third annual report (1835) speaking of the department of ‘‘me- 
chanical labor or handieraft work” as follows: 
** None of the articles have yet been brought into the public market; nor was it per- 
haps desirable, for the pupils have by no means attained that degree of skill of 
which they are capable. * * * The advantages to be derived from these occupa- 
tions are not, however, merely in the product of the labor, but in the tact and con-_ 
fidence which are acquired by the exercise of the physical powers. Indeed, thesame _ 
may be said of intellectual pursuits ; the learner comes to feel and know his powers, 
and svhoblicr he used them or not, has always the confident feeling ofa ‘ well-appointed 
man.’” 
In regard to the industrial departments of institutions for the blind it need only 
be said that the loss of sight has greatly circumscribed the number of mechanical - 
employments in which they can engage with profit. Music is, where there is no 
positive inaptitude, highly adapted to them as a trade. ‘This instruction was put 
upon a thoroughly scientific or technological basis in the Perkins Institution about 
1859. 
The present condition of the industrial departments in schools for the special classes 
has been so fully dealt with on pages 787-790 of our 1886-87 Report, and on pages 
912-921 of the Report for 1887-88, that the subject may now be dismissed with this 
reference, for our object is to show the different phases of the manual-labor theory, 
not the statistics of the schools having the manual-labor feature. fl 
TRADE OR HANDICRAFT SCHOOLS, 
The trade school pure and simple is not yet an American institution. It is true, 
as has been already noted, that with the establishment of special schools for the deaf, 
blind, and juvenile delinquents, trade teaching in a humble way was made a part 
sof the instruction given in such schools, but beyond this and the manual-labor move- )

ment of the third decade of the century, no general ses were made to provide 
technical schools until the great movement inaugurated by the act for the establish- 
ment of colleges of agriculture and the mechanic arts in 1962, a movement intensified 
by the introduction of drawing into the schools of Massachusetts, and the stimulat- 
ing effect of the industrial exhibition at the Centennial by merely showing what had 
been done in the industrial line in Europe. The act of 186: reads as follows: i 
“The leading object shallbe * * * to teac 1 such branches of learning as are 
related to agriculture and the mechanic arts in such manner as the legislatures of the 
States may respectively prescribe, in order to promote the liberal and practical edu- 
cation of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions of life.” 
Tt is not necessary to discuss the manner in which the provisions of this act have 
been carried out, but it is eminently proper to call attention to the judgments of two 
investigators who have visited this country in behalf of their respective Govern- 
ments, as to our neglect of lower technical or trade teaching, In 1883, Mr. William 
Mather, in reporting to the Royal (English) Commission on Technical Education, re- 
marks that the class of young people of each sex who seek employment which does not 
require manual labor is far too large in America, and thinks that this is especially 
undesirable in a new and unexplored country where nature is waiting for willing 
and skilled hands. ; 
In his report on ‘Public Instruction at the World’s Exposition at New Orleans,” 
Monsieur Buisson observes: Hatt 
“Notwithstanding her resources, America has not yet developed her system of 
State schools, elementary, secondary, or higher, so much in the line of technical and 
manual instruction as in the literary and intellectual way.”? 
On the other hand it has been remarked—the writer viewing the matter of un- 
skilled labor in its relations to skilled work rather than the aversion to labor—that 
“in America there are entirely too many people living directly otf the land—more 
than a due proportion of agriculturists, considering the producing power of the land 
and the increased use of machinery. Hence there is a continual pressure of the agri- 
cultural population upon the mechanic and manufacturing trades. * *  * This 
tendency to increase the number of artisans constantly works against the efforts of 
skilled labor to increase wages.” > 
Now it is a very interesting question to determine whether there is a demand for 
trade schools for these untrained persons, in which they could be professionally 
trained as an apprentice was trained to become a journeyman; and also whether 
establishing trade schools would remove the prejudice against manual labor which is 
more frequently attributed to public-school education than to an infirmity of human 
nature or to the American motto of “Excelsior.” But itis manifest that it is a ques- 
tion that can not be discussed here. 
We have repeatedly referred, in our reports, to the New York Trade Schools, but 
beside this institution and that at the Pratt Institute of Brooklyn we know of no 
other real trade school in the country except it be the weaving school of the Phila- 
delphia School of Design. The lately established Rindge School of Cambridge, Mass., 
we have not heard from, and the Williamson School has not yet gotten under way, 
nor the Towne School of Maryland, nor the Drexel School. The Miller Manual Labor 
School and the McDonogh School, however, classed with the manual-training schools, 
may be looked upon as trade schools. 
The condition of this subject in Europe has been well portrayed by the Royal 
(English) Commission, whose conclusions were published in extenso in our report for 
ig82-83, and again in Cireular of Information No. 3, 1885, as an appendix to the late 
Prof. Charles 0. ‘Thompson’s review of the English report. In addition, the avidity 
with which the French have lately developed the idea of national industrial instruc- 
tion is well shown by the monograph on the subject by Consul Schoenhof, published 
by the United States State Department, entitled ‘Industrial Education in France.” 
Ié.is, therefore, not necessary to crowd this sketch with quoted or translated matter. 
‘ MORALITY AND MANUAL LABOR. 
In the autumn of 1865 the Rev. Charles F. Barnard, representing a “‘ regular meet- 
ing of the ministers at large” of Boston, who had found themselves impelled by a 
sense of their responsibilities to call the ‘attention of the public authorities to ‘ex- 
posed and neglected little children,” petitioned the city government to give its atten- 
tion to five classes of children : ‘ : 
1. Juvenile criminals. 
2. Beggars, vagabonds, and petty thieves. 
3. Truants from school. —

The reading public, the educating part of it at least, need not be reminded of the 
discussion concerning the connection of illiteracy and crime, actively carried on some 
ten or fifteen years ago. In the Bureau’s Reports for 1871, 1872, and 1874, are articles 
on the relation of crime and illiteracy (which we would suggest is not synonymous 
with ignorance but merely indicates the absence of one and perhaps the most power- , 
ful means of removing ignorance) ; while in 1881 a pamphlet was issued under the 
title ‘Education and Crime.” Jt is not necessary to enter into this discussion, which 
still survives, nor is the object of the earlier articles apropos to the purpose of this, 
The writer of oue of those articles, however, seizing upon Quetelet’s deliverance 
that ‘‘ society prepares the crime which the criminal commits,” proclaims its truth 
and argues thence the necessity for universal education ‘‘ because education is a 
force restraining vice and crime.” Now, to insure universal education, that is to say, 
to prevent illiteracy, compulsion has been found necessary ; and compulsion, whena 
social mandate, is useless unless provided with a punishment for noncompliance. 
‘Those against whom this sanction may be enferced are called truants, and to apply 
the sanction officers are appointed called truant officers. 
But whatever may be the value of the “ philosophic statistician’s ” impeachment of 
society as an accomplice before the fact in the child’s guilt, it was the unanimous 
opinion of the truant officers of Boston that, in the great majority of cases, truancy 
was caused by drunkenness ef the truant’s parents. It may be inferred from this 
that, as in England, the parents of such children are of a low, uneducated class of 
persons; in a word, the class which furnishes the beggars and pilferers also furnishes 
the truants, and in either case the decensus Averni offers no impediments in the shape 
of early moral associations to the feet’of the youthful traveler of this unfortunate 
class when once he is well started on this easily traveled road. 
Although the principle be admitted that illiteracy breeds crime, particularly beastly 
crime, yet it is, from a theoretical standpoint, very easy to suppose that an other- 
wise respectable parent might ‘‘ permit so much barbarism” as ‘to allow the child to 
grow up illiterate. This would be an extremely grave offense in posse, so to speak, 
though a very minor one from a purely legal standpoint in esse, for the absence of the 
child from a school does not necessarily mean his enforced presence at a jail in after 
days. This kind of truancy, then, may be looked upon from the standpoint of the 
immediate present as'a very mild offense, if an offense at all, on the part of the child. 
But when the child is homeless or a wanderer, eking out his subsistence by associ- 
ating with every description of villany or moving in localities where such assovia- 
tions may be formed, the possibility of criminality has become something that the law 
may take cognizance of. The connection between crime and vagabondism is more 
immediate than between crime and neglect of the parent to have his child taught the 
elements of learning. Should the child have escaped the truant officer or the police- 
man and become a juvenile offender, that is to say, a petty thief, or worse, he may 
indeed be considered as a criminal; but as one entitled to consideration, on account, 
as Monsieur Quetelet might say, of society having ‘‘ prepared the crime that he has 
committed ;” because, as others might prefer to say, he has not had the associa- 
tions that would give him proper moral ideas. Such are the classes to which the cor- 
Sere apnenoes of care, education, and regular hours spent.in manual labor are ap- 
lied. 
os Whether statistics can support such extraordinary statements as ‘‘ Society prepares 
the crimes that the criminal commits,” and whether by “crime” the ninth century 
meant the same thing as the nineteenth, is not germane to the far more modest purpose 
of this sketch; but it is highly essential to its object that the statistics it presents 
should embrace an area sufficiently large to give those statistics value. We think 
that the island of Great Britain affords such statistics, for not only is it separated 
from the rest of Europe by language and geographical position, but, above all other 
European nations, it has the most continuously, comprehensively, and determinedly 
and, we may add, successfully attacked the source from which its juvenile criminal 
class has been fed. It is sometimes said that the English workman is the more un- 
ruly than the workmen of other nationalities; if this be true for the workman it may 
be assumed that it is true of the children of the lower orders of Englishmen. The 
English experiment, then, has been made under the very worst conditions. 
In 1854 reform schools were established for the correction of juvenile lawbreakers, 
and to supply the means of reducing the attendance at these institutions ‘industrial 
schools” were established in 1857, and the relation of the two defined in 1866. 
In the following table some comparisons have been attempted, the purpose of 
which a mere inspection of the headings will show, to say nothing of the remarks 
which follow the table by way of bringing out its value. To keep our article within 
bounds, we shall confine our attention to England and Wales.

ree) value of these percentages depends on whether the figures of column 3 are included in col- 
umn 2. 
d For six months only. , 
The candid reader will readily admit that if the whole population of England 
increased during the period of time covered by the table, the population under six- 
teen would form the same per cent. of the whole population in 1881 as it did in 1861. 
The population under sixteen, then, forming the same per cent. of the whole popu- 
lation year after year, it should furnish the same percent. of the whole number of 
persons sentenced year after year, and it is therefore perfectly legitimate to compare 
the per cent. of the population under sixteen sentenced in 1861 with that of any 
subsequent year. Let us apply this to the three categories of statistics before us, 
thus for eyery 100 persons of each category in 1861 there were in— 
Sentenced. Sentenced to industrial school (boys). 178 610 
804 
4,240 
  It is very plain that the number of adults sentenced have increased 58 per cent. 
while the boys under sixteen sentenced have decreased 35 per cent., or recurring to 
column 5 of the large table, which says the same thing in another way, the boys under 
sixteen sentenced were 9 per cent. of the whole body of men and boys committed in 
1861 and only 4 per cent, in 1881. But during this time the increase in the attendance 
at industrial schools has been 1,140 per cent. It is true that the education act of 
4871 has a decided tendency to increase the number sent to the industrial schools, but 
we have the testimony of the assistant inspector of reformatory and industrial schools 
that practically the same class of children were sent to the industrial school as truants 
by the enforcement of the act as has had before attended them. It must also be 
‘stated that in the number of children contained in column 2 may be included the num- 
ber given in column 3; even if such be the case the percentages of column 5 aro of 
‘value inasmuch as the industrial schools are reserved for vagrant and neglected child- 
ren under fourteen, which would go to show improvement in the character of the 
criminality. 
We are inclined to think, however, that the number of children given in column 
3 is not contained in column 4. , If such is the case the connection between an 
“industrial” or preventative school for every young children and the shrinkage in 
‘youthful criminality is pretty closely established by the figures, Nor are the figures 
unsupported, ‘‘All seem to agree,” says Lord Norton, who has been conversant with 
these schools for a number of years, ‘that the utterly vicious and criminal class of 
children, the fruit of national neglect [the reader will be reminded of Quetelet’s

MANUAL AND inDUSTRIAL TRAINING. 
dictum], which called first for reformatories no longer exists as a class, and individ- 
ually there are fewer and fewer such children in any locality; so that a call of them 
from all reformatories would not furnish enough for separate treatment in two or 
three schools.” In a word, the experience of England seems to show that if you can 
pick up the vagabond and beggar at an early age and instruct him in an ‘industrial 
school you have cut off the supply of half-grown but thorough-going scoundrels.” + 
On the adult population of law-breakers it seems to have exerted no effect; perhaps 
when Elmira-like reformatories for men shall have become general these figures, too, 
will decline.? k 
Now an essential, some would say the essential, feature of the industrial and of the 
reform school is manual labor, especially the learning of a trade, For,” says 
Superintendent Brockway of the great Elmira, N. Y., reformatory for men under 
thirty, ‘‘no reforiuatory system is complete that does not train each subject for a 
> specific industry for which he has a natural adaptation, and actually induct him into 
’ pose of developing their industrial faculties and training them to industrious habits, it, maintaining supervisory control long enough to insure a good degree of perma- 
nence and success. * * * There is a most intimate connection between the con- 
duct of reformed criminals and the readiness with which they can suitably support 
themselves.” 
As Mr, Brockway is talking about reformed criminals his remarks may be thought 
irrelevant to juvenile delinquents and vagabonds; but it would not be difficult to 
fill our pages with quotations going to show that a trade is very intimately connected 
with permanent respectability. 
Yet, as the statistics for England and Wales have been used, we should refer to 
them alone, The Royal (English) Commission in their report of 1834 use the follow- 
ing language :? 
“Both in reformatory and in industrial schools an essential feature of the work is 
the industrial training. The trade or occupation to which children, ate put should 
be suited to their age and physical strength; it should be adapted to the main pur- 
  and should be such as to give the individual boy or girl the means of earning a live. 
lihood at as early an age as possible. It is not absolutely essential that the trade 
should be one which the child will afterwards pursue, although this is very desirable. 
If the occupation taught and the skill and habits acquired enable him to compete on 
equal terns in the labor market with others, and to earn an honest livelihood, the 
main object has been attained.” 
Perhaps this subject may best be closed by giving the testimony of Col. William 
Inglis, inspector of certified reformatories and industrial schools, when examined by 
the commission : 
Question 462. How long haye you held your office? Answer. Six years, Question 656.” What are the trades thich are generally taught in reformatory schools? Answer. They are very various; agricultural training is one of the best fora reformatory,* and wo 
find it in nearly all of them whose situation permitsit; then there are shoemaking and tailoring shops 
in nearly all schools; besides those there are carpentry, joinering, bookbinding, basket making, and cask making at one place. You will find them all in the report on each school, which mentions what 
industrial occupations are carried on there. In the report which is before me, I find that the Stoke 
Farm Reformatory has a large farm, and market gardening is largely carried ‘on, and it has effective tailors’ and shoemakers’ shops also.’ Wood chopping is a great employment for the smaller boys, and firewood making, and in some places they make large quantities of match boxes; in fact there are a great variety of trades. 
Question 657. I see that in your evidence on the former occasion you rather suggested that it takes two or three years to learn some of the trades taught in those schools; what trade is there within 
your experience of which a knowledge would be sufiiciently attained in three years? ‘Answer. Not a complete knowledge but sufficient knowledge to get boys employment on leaving 
the schoo! and for them to get enough money to keep themselves. T do not men to say as much ag a practiced workman when they leave the school, but at all events they know as much as an apprentico in his second or third year would know. Question 658. In that case when he left the school a boy would be fit for an advanced position in an apprenticeship rather than obtaining his own living by the trade? i Answer. ‘That depends a good deal upon whether he is to follow such a trade as carpentry or joinery; that would bo the correct view to take of it. * * * Question 664. So that practically we are left without any reliable evidence as to the advantages de- rived by the boys from this smattering of a trade which is taught them in these schools?     
   
  
1 Though speaking‘of London only, Mr. Buxton, chairman of the school board of that city observes, ‘Since 1870, 7,566 children * * * have been sent to industrial schools. ‘The convictions for juve- 
nile offences are now only half what they were in 1870. The obvious connection between these figures. 
justifies me in putting them together,” .

Question 673. But it would be clearly better, would it not, in your opinion, that a boy should be a 
thorough master of something rather than a jack-of-all trades with no suflicient knowledge of any? 
Answer. The great thing in the training of our boys is to give them habits of industry and habits 
of using their hands and arms. It dovs not so much matter what trade they are taught so long as they 
are tausht to work, When they go out they can go on with the work that they have been taught in 
oy aie, or they can turn to some other sort of work. They do not get habits of idleness in the 
school. ‘   
  
NOTE A. 
On the ‘‘ third of Brumaire” of its ‘Year IV” (October 24, 1795), the French Revolntion passed a bill 
which, itiseaid, was its ‘capital work in the matter of instruction, thesynthesis of all its previous doings 
and projects, its scholastic testament as it were.” This pill provided for central schools, whose course 
of study was to be divided into three sections. Commenting on this course Monsieur A. Daruy, in 
his “ L'instruction publique et la revolution ” (p. 217), observes: f 
‘«What is immediately noticeable in this new organization of what we now call secondary instrac- 
tion is the importance accorded by the legislator to certain branches of study, ‘At the threshold of 
the edifice,’ to use the words of Lakanal, ‘is drawing, drawing which had been considered until then 
only as related to painting, but which, as related to the perfectment of the senses, accustoms the eye 
to seize with vigor the traits of nature, and is so to say the geometry of the eyeas music is that of the 
eaeit ‘ 
“The influence of Condillae and the sensualistic school,” continues M. Duruy, ‘is very manifest 
here. Indeed, if the ideas come from the senses, it follows that studies ought to commence by the 
recognition (connaissance) and the repr eduction of sensible objects. Ifthe view of an old oak produces 
in us the idea of force, the sight of a swallow that of movement and lightness, what better exercise could 
be devised for children than to have them copy swallows and oaks? What better, not only foredu- — 
cating their eye and hand, but still more and especially to put them in a condition to exercise their 
judgment? The teaching an art or a trade as in ‘Emile’ is no more the only question. Entirely 
different and based on another philosophy is the pedagogy of Lakanal and Daunou. The legislators 
of the Year IV had pretensions to build upon foundations that were entirely new and according to the 
_ rational method, thut is to say by commencing at the commencement. ‘This is why they placed draw- 
ing in the first section of their programme, and why they devote so large a space to it in the course, 
The idea was not devoid of merit.” _ 
NOTE B. 
“The Rational Agriculture,” said Fellenburg, ‘‘ which will proceed from Hofwy! and penetrate 
not only every district of Switzerland but of the whole civilized world, is the instrament for the 
physical and moral regeneration of mankind.” Upon the basis of an improved agriculture he would 
banish mechanical study {rom the school by giving it properly trained teachers who were able tounite 
the work of the common people with the work of the common school. In the general scientific in 
stitution which he established in 1808 the pupils were taught to honor agriculture as the primitive 
vocation of man (Urberuf), and as the only sure foundation for the prosperity of domestic and national 
affairs. Agriculture, thus ennobled, in addition to holding out a helping hand to the poverty stricken, 
would cause the wretched and outcast to detest a life of evil, and would restore them to a condition of 
manly self-conciousness, courage, and strength. ‘i

I.—PRESENT INTEREST IN THE SUBJECT. 
The question of religious instruction in public schools, always one of deep interest, 
has been brought into special prominence during the past two years by several 
events. It occupied an important place in the discussions before two successive an- 
nual meetings of the National Educational Association, viz, at Nashville, Tenn., 
July, 1889,! and again at St. Paul, Minn., July, 1890.2 The addresses on this subject 
excited much attention at the time and were widely copied and commented upon in 
the public press. ’ 4 
In February, 1889, the Senate Committee on Education and Labor devoted portions 
of two sessions, viz, February 15 and 22, to hearings upon a proposed amendment to 
the Constitution respecting establishments of religion and free public schools.* The 
proposal emanated from a meeting of citizens in Philadelphia, its purpose being to 
ingraft, upon the Constitution of the United States principles formally expressed in 
the constitutions or laws of many of the individual States. The amendment sub- 
mitted enjoined upon each State absolute neutrality in respect to religion and the ex- 
clusion of all schools, institutions, etc., where any sectarian doctrines, tenets, ceremo- 
nials, etc., are taught or inculcated from any participation in funds raised by taxation. 
The memorial of the citizens of Philadelphia was supported by delegates from the 
National Reform Association and from the American branch of the Evangelical Alliance 
and by individual citizens, and was accompanied also by a petition to the same effect 
bearing the signatures of above three thousand citizens of Massachusetts. The report 
of the hearings has been in great demand. 
Although the immediate purpose of the memorialists was not accomplished, the 
movement which they represented has given rise to a permanent organization of 
national extent, i. ¢., the National League for the Protection of American Institutions, 
incorporated December 24, 1889. The objects of this league are to ‘‘ secure constitu- 
tional and legislative safeguards for the protection of the common school system and 
other American institutions, and to promote public instruction in harmony with such 
institutions, and to prevent all sectarian or denominational appropriations of public 
fands.” It advocates an amendment to the Constitution‘ asthe most efficient measure 
for the accomplishment of these objects.

See Religion and Schools—Notes of hearings before the Committee on Education and Labor, United States Senate, February 15 and 22, 189. 
4The amendment proposed by the League is as follows: “No State shall pass any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or use its property or credit, or 
any money raised by taxation, or authorize either to be used for the purpose of founding, maintaining, or ing by appropriation, payment for services, expenses, or otherwise, any church, religious de- 
nomination or religious society, or any institution, society, or undertaking which is wholly or in part under sectarian or ecclesiastical control.”

The synod of New York of the Presbyterian Chureh in the United States of America 
appointed a special committee in 1885 to consider the best means of “ opposing the 
attitude of indifference to religion which appears both in public school manuals and 
in the educational systems of reformatories.”! This committee has been diligently at 
work collecting evidence bearing upon the seujects of its investigations and has 
annually reported the results of its labors to the synod. 
The agitation over the compulsory school laws of Illinois and Wisconsin was more 
or less involved in this same question of religious instruction and has served to in- 
crease interest in the subject outside of the States immediately affected. The feeling 
has been intensified by the decision of the supreme court of Wisconsin, March 18, 1890, 
relative to the reading of the Bible in public schools. The decision was rendered in 
‘““the Edgerton Bible case,” the history of the case being briefly as follows: “Two of 
the teachers in one of the district schools of the city of Edgerton were in the habit 
of reading selections from the King James version of the Bible at the opening of the 
daily sessions of theschool. To this practice objection was made by the parents of some 
of the children who attended the schoél. The school board declining to order the discon- 
tinuance of the reading of the Scriptures, the complaining parents applied to the cir- 
cuit court of Rock County for a mandamus to compel them to doso. The grounds 
on which the application was made will appear sufficiently hereafter. 
An alternative writ of mandamus was granted by the court, and to this the school 
board made return conceding the facts of the reading as alleged, specifying particu- 
larly the passages that had been read and objected to, denying the illegality of such 
reading, and maintaining their right and duty to permit the teachers to continue the 
ractice. on 
y To this answer and return the petitioners interposed a general demurrer. This 
demurrer was overruled by the court, Judge Bennett delivering an elaborate and 
learned opinion sustaining the school board. From this decision an appeal was taken 
to the supreme court, which overruled the decision, sustained the demurrer, and or- 
dered a peremptory writ of mandamus to issue as originally applied for.”? 
Tn the opinion of the State superintendent, Hon. J. B. Thayer, this decision virtually 
“declares the reading of the Bible in public schoois to be sectarian instruction, to be 
an act of worship, and a practice of uniting the functions of church and state, and 
therefore contrary to the inhibitions of the constitution of the State upon those 
joints.” 
y As a consequence of the lively interest awakened by these various events, many 
inquiries have been addressed to this Office touching the principles and policies rec- 
ognized and fostered in States and cities in respect to religious instruction and ob- 
servances in public schools. In particular, many of the correspondents have sought 
information as to adjustments which might have been made at any time between 
denominational organizations and public-school authorities, with a view to giving 
the former the privileges of the school room for the conduct of religious exercises. 
In order that the Office might fully meet these requests, a letter of inquiry was    
   give a very clear understanding of the treatment of religious instruction in general 
in our schools, and of the public opinion which prompts and sustains such action, 
The letter and essential portions of the replies are appended to this statement,‘ 
It seems also desirable in this connection to present as clearly as possible the status 
of this question in foreign countries, and more caectitey in England, whose policy 
is frequently cited as a worthy example for our own imitation. 
A minute investigation was made into the conduct of religious exercises by the royal 
commission appointed in 1886 to investigate the operations of the elementary education 
acts. The portion of their report bearing upon this subject gives a very clear insight 
into the practical Nerisines © the Englis! pane and presents, in the form of majority 
full discussion of the subject considered from opposite stand- 
points. Incidentally the report shows also. the practical difficulties in the way of 
making public schools the agencies of religious instruction. It forms, therefore, an 
important contribution to the stock of information and opinions upon the subject. 
‘As it was very generally asserted in England that the composition of the commission 
favored a fuller presentation of the clerical than of the secular view of the subject, 
it has seemed desirable to accompany the epitome of the portion of their report con- 
sidered with extracts from addresses made at a public conference held at Exeter Hall 
immediately after the document was issued. These addresses supply whatever may 
be. wanting to a complete view of the situation.

RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN PUBLIC scHooLs. 431 
The practical results of the deliberations of the commission were embodied in the 
education code of 1890. This code left the religious question where it was, Since 
that document was issued, however, the movement in favor of a uniform system of 
board schools has made decided advance. This movement is intimately related to 
the question of religious instruction. oa 
The “voluntary schools” of England are almost without exception denominational 
schools, in which ayowedly the chief end in view is the religious training of the child. 
These schools are not under public control, although they receive grants from the pub- ye 
lic treasury. The success of the measures now pending would bring all elementary 
schools sharing in the public funds to the basis of the present board schools. 
In dealing with the board schools the Government maintains strict neutrality in 
respect to religion and adheres firmly to the principle that public control should be 
inseparable from the application of public funds. 
In addition to the information relative to England, the report of the commissioners 
comprised replies to inquiries addressed to foreign countries. The portion of these 
returns relating to religious instruction is included in the following pages.

DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, 
BuREAU OF EDUCATION, 
Washington, D. C., August 13, 1890, 
Drak Srr: The universal interest attaching to the questions at issue between 
secular and denominational free schools has created a demand for detailed informa- 
tion as to practical efforts at compromise which may have been made in this country 
at any time between the parish-school and the public-school authorities. 
In order that this Office may be prepared to answer inquiries I desire to secure all 
possible information on the subject. Will you kindly aid me as far as you may be 
able by replying to the following questions, not excluding other items if such occur 
to you? 
Can you recall in your State or elsewhere in this country examples of adjustments 
between public and parochial school authorities TeVON Ren of the public-school 
funds, the rental of buildings belonging to the Roman Catholic and other churches, 
with special conditions as to teachers or exercises therein, or arrangements for reli- 
gious instruction? If so, the place and date of such, their duration and effects. 
Would such adjustments be illegal in your State? 
What reports of their operations have been made ? 
Thanking you for any attention you can give to this request, 
Iam, very respectfully, yours, 
Wan. T. Harris, 
Commissioner, 
{From Hon, Solomon Palmer, State Superintendent of Education, Alabama, August 13, 1890.) 
No examples within my knowledge. Our State constitution prohibits any public- 
school funds from being given to any sectarian or denominational school. 
[From Hon. E. 0. Chapman, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, New Jersey, August 18, 1890.) 
Replying to the inquiries in your circular letter just received, I have to say that I 
recall no effort in this State to secure a portion of the public-school funds for the use 
of parochial schools, except occasional arguments by church papers and leaders, 
I may add, that in my opinion any such effort would certainly fail to obtain its 
Object as it would be opposed by all the friends of our public-school system. 
[From Hon. J. W. Dickinson, Secretary State Board of Education, Massachusetts, August 18, 1890.) 
No adjustment between parochial and public school authorities has ever been 
made in Massachusetts, nor would such adjustment be legal. 
We hope to keep our public schools free from sectarian or political influences, con- 
fining their attention to those school exercises which have a tendency to make good. 
citizens in the best sense of that term. 
I believe such adjustments as those to which you refer have been made in Pough- 
keepsie, N. Y., at Rochester, and some other places in that State; Ido not know with 
what success. 
I do not know but that the acts of the regents in New York have made adjustments 
throughout the State. . 
If I can learn anything more on the subject I will communicate the information,

{From Hon. A. 8. Draper, State Superintendent Public Instruction, New York, August 18, 1890.] ' , 
T have no official knowledge of any movement in this direction in any part of this 
State, except that some three years since the board of education at Suspension Bridge, 
in this State, entered into an agreement by the terms of which it assumed charge of 
a parish school, previously maintained by a Catholic church, and agreed to maintain 
said school and to keep continually employed therein three persons of the class or 
order commonly called sisters of charity, of said denomination. The matter reached 
the department upon appeal, and it was held that such agreement was illegal and 
void. The board of education referred to then in fact assumed charge of the parish 
school, and in fact did employ such persons, dismissing’ some of them and amnotog 1s 
others of the same class in the mean time. Residents of the district objected to this 
proceeding and again brought the matter before the department upon an appeal from 
the refusal of the board of education to discontinue the arrangement. It was then 
held that while it was the duty of the board of education to provide ample school 
accommodations for all children in the district, and while it was not improper for 
the board to rent a building belonging to a Catholic church at Suspension Bridge, 
even at a nominal rental, for the purpose of maintaining a public school in such 
building, yet when it did do these things it must maintain a school which was in all 
regards a public sclool, and which conformed in all its circumstances and proceed- 
ings to the common-school system of the State. It was also held that the board of 
education in that instance had discriminated in favor of a particular class of persons 
within a specified religious denomination, and that such discrimination was mn- 
lawful. It was also held that the wearing of a distivguishing dress or garb, such as 
is commonly worn by the class of persons referred to, amounted to a sectarian influ- 
ence, as did also the custom which had there grown up of addressing these persons as    
" Sister Mary, Sister Martha, etc. 
The board of education was directed to require such teachers to discontinue such’ 
distinguishing garb and to cause the pupils and others in the school to address them 
by their family names with the prefix of Mrs. or Miss, as the case might be. The 
opinion of the superintendent upon the appeal last mentioned will be tound in the 
annual report of this department for 1883, at page 854, etc. 
T may remark that this determination led the church which had previously maiu- 
tained the parish school referred to, to resume charge of it, and its relations to the 
board of education at once ceased. 
Further than this I have no official knowledge of auy movement in the direction 
suggested by your inquiry. : ; 
{From Hon. J. Desha Pickett, State Superintendent Public Instruction, Kentucky, August 18, 1890.) 
The common-school law of Kentucky does not warrant in any manner or in any 
measure the division of school funds between a common school of the State and a 
' denominational school of any faith or order—Jewish, Protestant, or Roman Catholic. 
Sundry cases have occurred in communities exclusively Roman Catholic, but even 
- then such schools have been required to be taught as common schools, in which, as 
such, during school hours no sectarian or denominational doctrines can be taught. 
The great principle of this Commonwealth is that her common schools must be 
common in every regard; no union or compromise in any degree between the State 
and any church in any form or in any feature of it. f ' 
[From Hon. George B. Lane, State Superintendent Public Instruction, Nebraska, August 19, 1880.) 
Under the constitution and laws of Nebraska no compromise or adjustment could 
be made. In fact we have never had any of the troubles reported in other places. 
[From Hon. N. A. Luce, Slate Superintendent Public Instruction, Maine, August 19, 1890] 
There are only four or five parochial schools in Maine at this time, and the move- 
ment towards their establishment has little force. 
Any arrangement for divisions of school moneys between parochial and public 
schools or for payment of tuition in parochial schools would be illegal under our 
laws. Public-school moneys can be expended only in schools wholly controlled by 
public authorities. t 
(From Hon. D, L. Kiehle, State Superintendent Public Instruction, Minnesota, August 19, 1890.] 
There has never been a division of school funds in this State between the public and 
parochial schools. { 
Such a division would be illegal. The State constitution strictly prohibits it.

RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. | 433 
[From Hon. T. B. Stockwell, Commissioner Public Schools, Rhode Island, August 19, 1890.] 
Nosuch instances as those specified, or any other so far as I know, have ever occurred. 
in this State. Accordingly, the question has never been brought before our courtsfor » — 
a decision in that form. 
It has been decided that public-school property can not be used for any religious 
purposes if a single taxpayer objects thereto. } 
Ihave heard of instances of coéperation in Connecticut and New York, but do not i 
recall others, 
[From Hon..John Gannon, State Superintendent Public Instruction, Montana, August 21, 1890.) a 
No instance in which buildings were rented with special conditions as to teachers, 
or exercises therein, or arrangements for religions instruction. 
Such an agreement would be illegal in Montana. , z 
[From Hon. J.R. Preston, State Superintendent Public Instruction, Mississippi, August 22, 1890.] 
The only instance of adjustment that I am aware of in this State happened while 
I was superintendent of the Water Valley public schools. The Catholic children a 
attended the public schools, and the priest was allowed to give them one hour’s in- sy 
struction in religion twice a week in a class room after school. The priest and I both 
left at the end of the year and the place was abandoned. = « 
{From Hon. R. B. Bryan, State Superintendent Public Instruction, Washington, August 23, 1890.} 
I do not recall any instance of a compromise between parochial and public schools, 
outside of New Mexico, where it was reported to me when there some years ago that 
the practice of appropriating the common-school funds to the support of Catholic 
schools was very common, in fact, almost universal. Any arrangement of that kind 
would be illegal and uuconstitutional, and the aitempt would raise one universal 
howl of condemnation.   
co t 
[From Hon. J. L. M. Ourry, Agent Peabody Education Fund, Virginia, August 24, 1890.] 
In Virginia there is no example of adjustment between public and parochial 
schools, involving a division of school funds. Such an adjustment would not be in 
accordance with our public-school system. In my judgmentit would be highly detri- 
mental and unjust and involve pro tanto a hateful connection between.a-church or 4 
sect and the State. However plausible such a division of school funds may be made 
to appear, it involves the overthrow of our free schools, 
[From Hon. John Hancock, State Commissioner of Common Schools, Oosumbus, Ohio, August 23, 1890.] 
I have no knowledge of any attempt at such an adjustment, and if there had been 
an attempt of the kind, I think [should have been informed of it. Any such ad- 
justment would be illegal in our State. 
[From Hon. §. M. Finger, State superintendent public instruction, North Carolina.          I beg to inform you that in this State there have not at any time been any adjust- oie 
ments between the public and parochial school authorities involving a division of nit 
the public school funds. I do not anticipate any trouble on this subject in this State, e     
     
        
                        
              
    [From Hon. Henry Sabin, State superintendent public instruction, Iowa, August 25, 1890.) | 
   There are no schools in Jowa in which any adjustments between secularand denomi- 
national free schools have been made, as far as known at this office. 
No arrangements would be legal in this State which did not give the boards of 
directors full and complete control of the school und school buildings. In other 
words, the school would have to be, in every sense, a public school, in order to be 
entitled to a proportionate share! of public money. j 
The following extracts from the Iowa school law, section 1764 (ce) (d) were inclosed : phe 
“(¢e) The diversion of the school fund in any form or to any extent for the support 4 y 
of sectarian or private schools is inadmissible and clearly in violation of our laws.

J found Roman Catholic parochial schools in Savannah included in the public sys-

In the open country this practice, I am told, is so common that in some districts 
all the schools are of this sort. The leading educators of the State regard this as one 
cause of the low educational condition of Georgia. The temptation to subsidize a 
private or denominational school already on the ground for a few months, leaving such 
children as desire to remain members of it on the expiration of the term, is held to 
‘be a leading cause of the neglect and the unwillingness of the legislature to appro-

i I do not recall any case of attempted adjustments between public and parochial

division of school fands raised by taxation for the support of parochial schools would 
Ba be impossible, as there is a constitutional provision which would preyent it. 
f ‘ ‘As this subject was mooted in some of the States, the constitutional convention of 
New Hampshire, in 1876, adopted an amendment, which was accepted by the people, 
as follows: ‘{No money raised by taxation shall ever be granted or applied for the 
use of the schools or institutions of any religious sect or denomination.” So you see 
such a thing in this State would be impossible. It is a question whether or not 
article vi of the bill of rights in the constitution of New Hampshire as originally 
drawn would have allowed such a division if the above amendment had never been 
made. i 
I have never known the school authorities of any town or city of this State to rent

school had vacated it. t 
Roman Catholic young ladies are educated in our normal school and employed in 
our public schools as teachers without any question as to their religions predilec-

Catholics have several academies and one college in this State. The public-school 
laws of this State would not, in my opinion, permit the union of chureh and State in 
this way; that is to say, neither the public-school law nor public opinion would

The constitution of the State forbids the appropriation of any part of the perma-

There is no adjustment whatever between the public-school authorities of Pennsyl-

Letter contained the following inclosures: 
Constitution of 1873, Article X, Education: 
‘SnoTion 2. No money raised for the support of the public schools of the Common- 
wealth shall be appropriated to or used for the support of any sectarian school.” 
DEPARTMENT oF PuBLic INstRUCTION, ; 
Harrisburg, October 1, 1888, 
Rey. I. N. Hays, D. D., I. H. Batpwin, Esq.: 
Dear S1xs: As a committee representing quite a large body of the citizens of Pitts- : 
burgh, you have asked this department to give its official construction of the law 
overning school directors in the purchase, holding, and disposal of school property. 
‘he request is grounded upon what you regard a violation of law by a board of 
directors within the Pittsburgh school district, who, as alleged, have rented or leased 
a public school-building for the use of a private and parochial school. 
This department can see no reason why it should not make official answer; and 
the question raised is of such fundamental importance that we feel constrained to 
send our construction of the law to the directors referred to as well as to yourselves. 
The constitution of the Commonwealth (Article X, sections 1-2) declares that ‘the 
general assembly shall provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and 
efficient system of public schools, wherein all the children of the Commonwealth, above 
the age of six years, may be educated, and shall appropriate at least one million dol- 
lars each year for that purpose,” and that ‘‘no money raised for the support of the 
public schools of the Commonwealth shall be appropriated to or used for the support 
of any sectarian school.” Under these wise and imperative declarations of the con- 
stitution our public school system is carried forward and must be maintained. 
In establishing the public school system, the maintenance and support of which 
the present constitution thus makes imperative, the general assembly by act approved 
May 8, A. D, 1854, section 18, provides ‘ that the several school districts within this 
Commonwealth shall have capacity as bodies corporate * * * to purchase and 
hold such real and personal property as may be necessary for the establishment and 
support of the schools, and the same to sell, alien, and dispose of when it shall no 
longer be necessary for the purposes aforesaid.” 
It is plain from this section, without further citation, that school houses and 
grounds are held by boards of directors as corporate bodies in trust for the use of the
-P-A-G-E-508
  ‘ 4 K pag rhe SS 
nye ji SENG) A ee $ ‘ if ae $ 
436 : |. EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
public schools; that is, for schools established and maintained by the public fund, 
under the authority of the constitation and laws, not for private or parochial schools, 
bnt for statutory schools. ; oer 
Beyond the limits of such trast directors have no right to go. All diversion of 
school property to other uses not purely incidentalis clearly unauthorized and illegal. 
It certainly is a plain principle of law that corporate property nust be used solely 
for corporate purposes. Otherwise, all the school property of the Commonwealth 
might by a simple vote of directors be devoted to any purpose they saw fit. 
In the syllabus of a decision rendered by Hon, George W. McIlvaine, chief justice 
of the supreme court of Ohio (35 Ohio, f. 143), it is held, first, that ‘‘ boards of edu- 
cation are invested with the title tothe property of their respective districts in trust 
for the use of public schools, and the appropriation of such property to any other 
. use is unauthorized,” and, second, ‘that a lease of a public schoolhouse foc the pur- 
pose of having a private or select school taught therein for a term of weeks is in 
Violation of the trust, and such use of the schoolhouse may be restrained at the suit 
_ of a resident taxpayer of the district.” 
In rendering the decision, this able judge says: “ The questions in this case relate 
‘solely to the power of a board of education to appropriate the public schoolhouse of 
its district to private uses, or, indeed, to any use other than public schools.” After 
citing the Ohio enactment for the reorganization and maintenance of common schools, 
which defines the powers and capacities of school directors in language almost the 
exact parallel of our enactment above quoted, he says: “By virtue of these sections, 
all public schoolhouses are vested in the boards of education in trust for the use of 
the public or common schools, and the appropriation of them to any other use is 
unauthorized and illegal.” 
In the case submitted to us it is stated that the board of directors have rented or 
leased a public school building for the use of a parochial school, where the peculiar 
dogmas and usages of a particular church are promulgated and taught, or where only 
@ certain: distinct class of children are admitted. In this case, granting the state- 
ment of facts, there is not only an unauthorized violation of trust, but a seeming 
indifference to what is explicitly forbidden by the constitution of the Commonwealth 
itself. * 
‘A school is not sectarian because taught by a minister, or priest, orany church official. 
But a school controlled or managed in the interest of any particular church organi- 
zation, upholding its peculiar confession and ecclesiastical practices, and used for 
any class of pupils, exclusive of others, is certainly sectarian. It does not, in any 
sense, belong to our system of public schools. On the. contrary, no money raised for 
the support of the public schools can be used for its support, without a direct viola- 
tion of the constitution. Were school directors permitted to lease our public school 
property thus, at their own will, for the use of parochial schools, the ecclesiastical 
convictions of the directors could turn our publie schools into as many different kinds of 
church schools as there are different denominations in the Commonwealth. The point 
js too plain to require any further explanation. 
Some may be willing to grant that directors can allow school buildings to be used, 
outof school hours, for such incidental purpose as singing schools, debating societies, 
ete., without justifying an injunction of restraint, although there has been a de- 
cision in Connecticut, by a divided court, even against this (see 27 Connecticut, f. 499), 
yet here, the school building, as alleged, is used, not incidentally, but exciusively 
for a purpose not contemplated in the law and forbidden, as regards statutory schools, 
py the constitution itself. The very fact that the school building is rented, or leased, 
of granted for the temporary use of a school is sufficient evidence that its essential, 
corporate use is perverted; for public schools do neither lease, nor rent, nor ask for 
the temporary use of that very property which, by public tax, has been purchased | 
and is to be held in trust for their permanent use alone.

_I do not know of any adjustments between public and parochial school authorities 
involving a division of the public school funds, The State constitution prohibits the 
appropriation of any funds raised by taxation to purposes of sectarian education.

[From Hon. Frank M. Smith, State superintendent public instruction, Tennessee, October 14, 1890.) 
In this State no compromise has ever been made. The Roman Catholics have their 
schools, but they do not receive any of the benefits of the public school fund of the 
State because they will not send their children to the public schools, and that is the 
only way to compromise the matter, I

RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. | 437. 
[From Hon. J. S. Boreman, State commissioner of schools, Utah, Oclover 30, 1890.] 
Throughout this Territory it has been, I am informed, a common practice until 
within a very recent period for the pablic schools to be conducted very much as 
Morinon church schools. This practice has passed, or is rapidly passing away. Ido 
not think that it is now practiced, although a case or two has been reported to me, 
and I am now investigating the same.. This whole proceeding of conducting the 
public schools as church schools was, of course, in violation of law and contrary to 
the genius of our Government. No other church has been connected with the public 
schools in this Territory. 
(From Hon. W. J. Olapp, State superintendent public instruction, Dakota, November 10, 1890.] 
Religious teaching can not be well given in our public schools. The various and 
antagonistic ideas of parents and guardians, and consequently the children, upon 
matter and form of religion would lead to harm, it seems to me, if any form of 
religion is attempted to be taught in the free public schools. 
Our State is new and cities small. So far as I can learn, in but one city has any 
attempt been made to support denominational schools with public funds. In the city 
of Wahpeton one school board by resolution, for about twenty months paid the Roman 
Catholic parochial school in the way of tuition at the rate of $250 per annum. This 
amount was paid against the protest of many of the citizens. The scheme proved 
unpopular, and now all classes of citizens are much better pleased with the present 
system, which carefully excludes everything in the way of religious instruction, and 
teaches only, in addition to the usual branches, good morals, a love and respect for 
one another and for the common country. 
The following account of what has become widely known as the Poughkeepsie plan 
is from a statement made by George E. Cramer, President of the Board of Education, 
Poughkeepsie, N, Y. 
“About seventeen years ago, the Board of Education of Poughkeepsie assumed 
eontiol of two large parochial schools which for several years had been maintained at 
its own expense by the St. Peter’s Catholic Church of this city, in buildings owned 
and erected by that church for school purposes, 
* “The conditions upon which the board accepted these schools were substantially 
and in brief as follows, viz: 
The board to lease from the church the school buildings at the nominal rent of $1 
per annum, keep them in repair, pay insurance, cost of heating, teachers’ salaries and 
other expenses of maintaining the schools, and conduct them in the same manner as 
the other schools of the city under its supervision; the church reserving the privilege 
of using the building for its own purposes outside of school hours, but no religious 
instruction to be given during said school hours. 
“The course of studies, text-books, appointment, of teachers, and general conduct 
and control of the-schools to be entirely under the jurisdiction of the board, and the 
members of the board and its officers and agents to be allowed free-access to the build- 
ings during school hours. This arrangement is still in operation.” 
Hon. B. M. Zettler, superintendent of public schools, Macon, Ga., says: 
“The second year of our school system the Roman Catholics petitioned our board to 
elect two teachers, Sisters of Mercy or members of the Roman Catholic Church, as pub- 
lic school teachers, and allow them to occupy a building furnished by members of that 
Chureh, and also to permit children of that congregation from all parts of the city, with- 
out regard to school-district lines, to attend the school thus provided for. The appli- 
cation was granted, and the same arrangement has continued to thisdate. The same 
books are used in this school as in the others, and the school has the same daily ses- 
sions as the others.” 
The following additional cases are reported from Georgia : 
“The school board of Augusta,” as appears from the report of the city superintend- 
ent, ‘simply appoints Catholic teachers to certain school buildings for which the city 
pays norent. Some of the teachers belong to the order of Sisters of Mercy, and in 
consideration of their veiled seclusion they were, at the special request of the com- 
missioner, excused from attendance on the normal class by the trustees of the wards 
in which their schools are situated. This the trustees had a perfect right to do under 
the rules of the board. Others of these teachers belong to the order known as Chris- 
tian Brothers. They do attend the normal class.” % 
ae plan of union between Roman Catholics and the city schools in Savannah is 
as follows: . 
“J, The Catholic schools shall be received under control of the Board of Education. 
“2. Teachers in the Catholic schools shall be in all cases members of the Catholic 
Church, but to be subject to examination and appointment by the Board of Education. 
«3, The text-books used in these schools shall be the same as are used in the other 
public schools, except books on history, geography, and reading books,

4, These schools shall bé opened with reading the Scriptures and the Lord’s 
Prayer. Such versions of Scripture may be used as the teacher may prefer. ieee 
“5, The school building shall be under the control of the Board of Education. — 
“6, The trustees of the Catholic school buildings shall have power to withdraw 
- them from the Board of Education at the end of any school year whenever they are 
dissatisfied with the arrangement, provided that they shall give 3 months’ notice of 
such withdrawal. i | f | 
“7, In case of such withdrawal the Board of Education may remove all apparatus, 
books, movable fixtures, and furniture which they may have furnished for these 
schools. $ 
«8, The Board of Education shall have full control of the discipline, instruction 
and general management of these schools the same as of the other schools under 
their care, including also the length of sessions, the arrangement of school, courses 
of study, work and duties, and all the interests of the schools. 
“<9, The teachers of these schools will be expected to attend the meetings of the 
normal class the same as teachers of other public schools. ‘They will give respectful 
attention to the suggestions and instructions of the superintendent, and are expected. 
to exert themselves tu carry out his views in the management and instruction of 
their schools. 
“10, The holidays shall be such as are usually given in Catholic schools.” 
The superintendent of public instruction, Hon. W. H. Baker, says: 
“This arrangement was made just after the war, when it was absolutely necessary 
to have unity of action to preserve our public school system. It has worked very 
harmoniously and to the satisfaction of all parties.” ‘ 
IIL.—RELIgious AND MoraL TRAINING IN PuBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS, ENGLAND 
AND WALES. 
A royal commission was appointed, by Queen Victoria in 1886 to inquire into the 
working of the English elementary education acts. This measure was necessitated 
by complications growing out of peculiar features impressed upon the system of edu- 
cation at the outset. Some account of the origin of the system is therefore necessary 
to an understanding of the work of the commission. This is especially true of that 
part of its work relating to religious and moral instruction. 
Prior to 1870 the education of the English masses was left to private enterprise or 
religious zeal.!_ Two societies, founded early in the century, had endeavored, each in 
its own way, to give organization and character to the work. The British and 
. Foreign School Society? was due to the labors of Joseph Lancaster, although it was 
formed directly by the efforts of Joseph Fox and William Allen, The purpose of this 
society was to make provision for the ‘‘nonsectarian elementary instruction of the 
children of the poor.” The society grew rapidly, and in 1812 had become essentially 
apublic movement. 4 \ i 
The National Society ? for promoting the education of the poor in the principles of 
the established chnreh owed its origin to the efforts of Dr. Bell. It was founded in 
1811 and incorporated in 1817, The connection of this society with the established 
church gave it from the outset the advantage of a powerful and far-reaching organi- 
zation, audits growth was exceedingly rapid and vigorous. The scale on which these 
so¢ieties conducted their work and their laudable rivalry had the effect of arousing 
public interest, and it soon became evident that private funds alone would not suf- 
fice to overcome ignorance in the realm. In 1833 a public grant of $100,000 was 
voted in aid of the work of elementary education. The fund was to be adminis- 
tered by the treasury, and was to be strictly limited to the bnilding of schoolhouses. 
Applications were to be indorsed by the National Society or by the British and For- 
eign School Society, but in no case'was the grant to exceed half the cost of the 
buildings. In 1839 the grant was raised to £30,000 ($150,000), and its administra- 
tion ittrusted to a committee of the privy council—i. ¢., the committee of council 
on education [appointed April 10, 1839]. 
In the same year the principle of State supervision as an inseparable accompani- 
ment of State aid was established. In 1846 the application of the grant was ex- 
tended, appropriations being allowed under certain conditions for teachers’ salaries 
and for the services and training of pupil teachers who were employed in the schools 
of the two great societies; the next year the grant was raised to $500,000. In 
1853 grants were allowed in respect of schools in small rural districts and unincor- 
porated towns which could show a certain fixed number in attendance, and in 1856 
a similar measure was extended to urban schools; in 1860, under the direction of Mr. 
Robert Lowe, the many minutes which had been issued were combined into a code

generally known as the ‘‘ original code” ; in 1862 a revised code! was issued by which 
the system of aid was essentially modified, the most radical change being the intro- 
duction of the policy of payment upon results. x 
These successive measures were an index of the growing and deepening agita- 
tion of the public mind with respect to the education of the masses. The operations 
of the national society, stimulated and extended by the aid received from the state, 
roused to action all the forces opposed to the diffusion of sectarian doctrines at pub- 
lic expense. At the same time the failure of voluntary agencies, when operating un- 
der the most favorable conditions, to provide anything like the accommodation de- 
manded, made it evident that no instrumentality short of the Government itself was 
adequate for a work that concerned every member of the body politic. 
In 1869 the ‘‘ National Education League” was founded in Birmingham, with the 
avowed object of securing the education of every child in England and Wales. The 
taal proposed by the league for the accomplishment of this. purpose were as 
follows: 
(1) Local authorities to be compelled by law to se’ that sufficient school accom- 
modation is provided for every child in their district; (2) the cost of founding and 
maintaining such schools as might be required to be provided out of the local rates 
supplemented by government grants; (8) all schools aided by local rates to be under 
the management of the local authorities and subject to Government inspection; (4) all 
schools aided by local rates to be unsectarian; (5) to all schools aided by local rates 
admission free; (6) school accommodation provided, the State or local authorities 
to have power to compel the attendance of children of suitable age not otherwise 
receiving education? ‘ 
In other words, the league proposed a system of non-sectarian, gratuitous, compul- 
sory education. The majority of English statesmen were not prepared to support so 
radical a scheme, but regarded with more favor the proposition formally put forth by 
the “National Education Union” to secure the primary education of every child by 
judiciously supplementing the existing denominational system. These two opposite 
roposals came into collision in the celebrated debate of 1870 over the bill introduced 
y Mr. W. E. Forster ‘‘ to provide for public elementary education in England and 
Wales.” This debate was one of the most spirited, determined, and rsmarkable con- 
tests of opinion and policies that is to be found in the history of educational legisla- 
tion, and but for the honest intention of the opposing parties to end the shameful 
neglect of the young which had become so dark a blot upon the national honor, no 
compromise could have been effected. 
In view, however, of the fact that upwards of 1,500,000? children of the working — 
classes between the ages of 6 and 12 years were destitute of all provision for instruc- 
tion or were at the hazard of schools worse than none, differences of opinion were 
waived or modified, and the amended bill became an act through the united efforts 
of the advocates of opposite policies. ; 
The intent of the act was to provide for the elementary education of all the chil- 
dren of the country. For the accomplishment of this purpose the country was 
divided into school-board districts, within which the school boards were to be elected. 
The boards were authorized to claim or levy rates for the maintenance of public 
elementary schools, and the Government assumed the right to order the election 
of boards wherever the rate-payers ignored or evaded the law. At the same time 
schools established by private agencies (i. ¢., voluntary schools) were admitted to 
share in the Government grant upon the same terms as board schools, provided 
that their managers fulfilled certain specified conditions. The policy of the Govern- 
ment in respect to voluntary schools remained substantially the same as before the 
passage of the act. The new departure was the assumption on the part of the Gov- 
ernment of the right and the obligation to see to it that sufficient school accom- 
modation was provided for the whole population, and the policy of making the rates 
contributory to the board schools, 4. ¢., the schodls established by public initiative. 
Above 12,000 voluntary schools or departments, with accommodations for nearly 
2,000,000 children, were receiving Government aid at the time of the passage of the 
act.® 
These were largely denominational schools and, almost without exception, schools 
in which religious instruction formed an important part of the training; hence it will 
readily be seen that, while the conflicting opinions had been waived in order that 
an education act might be passed, the religious question became a vital issue in 
the framing of the act. 
In the settlement of the question the Government carefully avoided committing 
itself, directly at least, to the promotion of sectarian instruction, and with equal

care endeavored {0 guard against interference with the religious seruples or conyic- tions of the people. The former purpose is scen in the restriction of the Government examination to secular subjects and general discipline and the apportionment of the grant on the results of this expmination, and the latter purpose in the section of the act} dealing directly with the matter of religious instruction, which is as ‘li Bi) ae Pea eas te

_‘‘Every elementary school which is conducted in accordance with the following 
regulations shall be a public elementary school within the meaning of this act; and every public elementary school shall be conducted in accordance with the following 
regulations (a copy of which regulations shall be conspicuously put up in every such school), namely : ) ; 7 (1) It shall not be required, as a condition of any child being admitted into or 
continuing in the school, that he shall attend or abstain from attending any Sunday school or any place of religious worship, or that he shall attend any religious obser ance or any instruction in religious subjects in the school or elsewhere, from which observance or instruction he may be withdrawn by his parent, or that he shall, if withdrawn by his parent, attend the school on any day exclusively set apart for religious observance by the religious body to which his parent belongs. 
(2) The time or times during which any religious observance is practised or instruction in religious subjects is given at any meeting of the school shall be either at the beginning or at the end, or at the beginning and the end of such meeting, and shall be inserted in a time-table to be approved by the education department, and to be kept permanently and conspicuously affixed in every schoolroom; and any scholar may be withdrawn by his parent from such observance or instruction without for- feiting any of the other benefits of the school. 
‘*(3) The school shall be open at all times to the inspection of any of Her Majesty’s 
inspectors, so, however, that it shall be no part of the duties of such inspector to inquire into any instruetion in religious subjects given at such school, or to examine 
any scholar therein in religious knowledge, or in any religious subject or book. * (4) The school shall be conducted in accordance with the conditions required to be fulfilled by an elementary school in order to obtain an annual Parliamentary grant.” This section, commonly known as the “ conscience clause,” is equally binding 
upon board and voluntary schools, It will be noticed that it does not exclude paaie rian teaching, but simply provides for the withdrawal of children from such instrue- tion if the parents so desire. : > Under the act of 1876 it was made the duty of local authorities ‘‘to report to the education department any infraction of this conscience clause in any elementary school within their district which may come to their knowledge, and also to forward to the education department any complaint which they may receive of the infrac- tion of those provisions.” 
Board schools were bound also by the fourteenth section of the act, which propite in them “the teaching of any religious catechism or religious formulary which is distinctive of any particular denomination.” 
In view of these explicit and judicious provisions it is a significant fact that the dis- turbances, which made the commission of 1886 an imperative necessity, grew largely out of the religious difficulty, or perhaps we should say out of the conflicting inter- ests of board and denominational schools, or of their respective advocates, 
The importance which the commissioners attach to the matter of religious and moral instruction is indicated in the following declaration of their views :? Importance of the subject.—‘ Having been commissioned by your majesty,” they say, “to inquire into the working of the elementary education acts, we should fail in our duty did we not review the religious and moral effect of the present system, and of   he provisions made by law for enabling and controlling religious as well as secular’ instruction. While the whole commission is animated by one and the same desire to secure for the children in the public elementary schools the best and most tho: ough instruction in secular subjects suitable to their years and in harmony with the re- quirements of their future life, it is also unanimously of opinion that their religious and moral training is a matter of still higher importance alike to the children, the parents, and the nation, though the views of its members differ as to the method whereby this object of supreme moment should be attained.” These differences of opinion as to means entertained by men who were agreed in respect to the supreme importance of religious instruction were radical, as will be shown by the majority and minority reports. ' Method of the investigation.—The investigations of the commission were pursued by the oral examination of witnesses and by printed inquiries. Among the latter were (1) a circular addressed to the managers of all voluntary schools and to all school boards in ten counties,® selected as typical; (2) a circular addressed to head teachers

in.twelve districts. In the replies to the first-named inquiry 3,759 voluntary schools 
were represented. The information which they afforded with respect to the status of 
religious instruction is thussummarized by the commissioners. f 
SUMMARY OF RETURNS MADE TO THE COMMISSION. 
In the return from managers of yoluntary schools and from school boards in 10 
counties, the managers of the voluntary schools state respecting these voluntary 
schools that: wa a 
1. In 102 schools, or less than 3 per cent. of the number answering, no religious in- 
struction is given. 
2. In 1,261 schools (33 per cent. of all the answers) religious teaching is encroached 
upon (i. ¢., suspended or abridged) before the Government inspection, in most cases 
slightly. N 
3. In 3,618 schools the religious teaching is given by the teachers, and in 2,079 of 
es (55 per cent. of all the answers) it is also given by other persons (clergy or 
adies). 
4. In 286 schools (8 per cent.) the registers of attendance are marked before religious 
teaching and observances. : 
In 2,295 schools the registers of attendance are marked after religious teaching 
and obsérvances. 
In 443 schools the registers of attendance are marked both before and after. 
The returns from 331 school boards in the same counties show that: 
1. Thirty-three boards give no religious teaching in their schools. 
2. In the schools of 103 boards (or 30 per cent. of boards which make returns) re- 
gece teaching is encroached upon before the Government inspection, in most cases 
slightly. i 
3. In the schools of 358 boards the teachers give the religious teaching, and in the 
schools of 43 of the above boards some other persons also give it. 
4. In the schools of 11 boards the registers are marked before the religious teach- 
ing and observances. 
In the schools of 318 boards after. 
In the schools of 37 boards both before and after. 
In the returns from the head teachers of all schools, both voluntary and board, in 12 
counties or populous urban districts it is stated that: i 
1. In 320 departments (i. ¢., schools or sections each haying its own head teacher) 
or 9 per cent. of all that sent in replies, no religious teaching is given. 
2. In 1,013, or 32 per cent., religious teaching is abridged to a slight extent (except 
in York West Riding, where it isreported that ‘‘ one-half the time is encroached upon 
in many cases”) before the Government inspection. 
3. In 3,220 departments the teachers give the religious teaching, and in 1,602 of 
these other persons (chiefly clergy or ladies) also give it. 
4, In 281 departments the registers are marked before the religious teaching or 
observances ; in 2,344 after, and in 741 both before and after. 
These summaries give a pretty clear insight into the relation between religious in- 
struction and the schools. They indicate that it is a general feature, and is in many 
cases the means by which the influence of the clergy is brought to bear directly upon 
the minds of the young. 
With respect to the working of the conscience clause,? the commissioners say: 
“Our returns may be held to show its operation throughout the whole country, as 
the counties and districts to which our questions were sent are sufficiently numerous 
and typical to enable us to argue fairly from them as to the country at large. The 
managers of voluntary schools in the undermentioned counties report as follows:

a ‘cThese figures apply, first, tothe number of schools in which children are daily 
withdrawn by their parents from religious teaching, and, secondly; to the same or 
other schools in which, there being an annual examination into the results of reli- 
gious teaching, the children are withdrawn from such an examination by their par- 
. ents; and they clearly prove that the conscience clause is ractically operative all 
: over the country in the most different classes and districts of the population.” 
It may be added that it is also quite evident that the instances in which a

  a avail themselves of the privilege of withdrawing children are not numerous. This 
fact however, as will subsequently appear, is not necessarily a proof of sati ction

a DETAILED VIEW OF RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN BOARD, SCILOOLS, 
The school boards of England, established originally as a machinery for overcoming 
the deficiency in school accommodation, have done vastly more than this, In the 
communities where they have been elected they have developed the exer ise of 
private judgment and the nae: of combined action among men formerly inapt for 
general affairs; consequently the status of these boards in respect to religious train 
, ing givesa much better insight into the real attitude of mind which Englishmen hold 
in this respect than the corresponding action of voluntary ape 
This important difference has been clearly recognized by the Government, and from 
time to time, parliamentary inquiries have been instituted for the purpose of ascer- 
taining the exact provisions made. by school boards for religious instruction, The 
last of these was a return of 1888, which was published as an appendix to the final 
‘ report of the commission. This material is a complete index to the action of the 
i poards in the matter under consideration ; it affords illustrations of almost every con- 
Re ‘eeivable method of treating religious instruction in schools maintained for purposes 
spit of secular training, and suggests, by the mere completeness of presentation, the diffi- 
t culties that beset the endeavor to employ one agency for the twofold work. Inci- 
dentally also it reveals the conception of religious training entertained by the pro- 
nounced advocates of clerical schools. The material is therefore of interest wherever 
the subject of religious vs. secular instruction is discussed, for which reason it is here 
ptesented somewhat in detail. : 
‘The questions comprised in the parliamentary inquiry were as follows: uy 
1, Is any religious teaching orreligious observance practiced or given in the schools 
Dat of the board? ; 5 
{ 2, Ave any hymns or prayers used ? 
3. Is the Bible read (with or without comment thereon?) 
4 4. State the time (if any) allotted to each subject. 
: 5. Give the syllabus of religious instruction. 
1 6. Give the rules (if any) for annual examination in religious knowledge. 
me 7. Acopy of the regulation of the board, in pursuance of which the religious ob- 
servances atid instruction are carried out, should be furnished. 
8. If no formal regulation has been passed, state the practice of the school under 
the board. I

RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION 1N PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 448 
The general status of the boards with respect to the subject of inquiry may be seen 
from the following summary: 
‘Total number of boards, England and Wales. ... 
      
     Number of boards under which no schools had be 74 
Number making no provision for religious exercises. 91 
Number using hymns and prayers, but no Bible reading 101 
Number adopting the system of Bible reading without note B94 Number framing or adopting schemes of undenominational religious instruction. 1, 506 Number allowing denominational teaching under special agreement ....... 55 
Number in whose schools denominational instruction had been given in violation of the law. 34 
The 91 boards that made no provision for religious exercises were distributed in 18 
counties.! 
The remaining boards, forming a very large proportion of the 96 per cent. of the 
whole number maintaining schools, fall into three categories with respect to religious 
exercises, namely: (1) Those that have prayers and hymns, one or both, without Bible 
reading. (2) Those that have adopted Bible reading without note or comment. (3) 
, Those that have framed or adopted schemes of religous instruction. x 
In the first category, viz, those that use hymns or prayers but no Bible reading, 
there are 101 school boards, distributed in 32 counties. 
Biwiz Reaping wituouT Note or Comment. 
The plan of Bible reading without note or comment is due to the action of the Na- 
tional Education League. 
The regulations with respect to religious instruction in the act of 1870 not being in 
accordance With the programme of the leagué, that association sought to accommodate 
itself to the situation by the adoption of the formula, “ Bible reading without note 
or comment,” and this was the system accepted in the boards generally on which 
adherents of the league had a majority. Birmingham, the headquarters of the league 
and a great center of liberal thought, would naturally have been expected to follow 
the same course. The plan was not, however, adopted by the first. Birmingham 
board, ‘for the reason that the denominational party secured a majority of seats 
on that board, and a regular system of undenomihational religious instruction was 
agreed upon. On thesecond Birmingham board, at the end of the first triennial term, 
the advanced party secured a majority of seats; but by this time the Birmingham ad- 
vanced education party had, after much consideration, abandoned the scheme of Bible 
teiching without note or comment, and adopted the plan of secular instruction only 
provided by the school boards, with arrangements for separate religious teaching and 
observances, by voluntary agency and not by the board’s teachers, in the time set 
apart in the tine tables. Thisscheme was forthwith introduced into the Birmingham 
board schools in the second triennial term and carried on for some years. But inthe 
Birmingham triennial election of 1879 a difference of opinion.was made manifest 
among the supporters of the Liberal candidates on the question of the board’s policy 
scheme of Bible reading without note or comment was conceded. From that time to 
the present a scheme of Bible reading without note or comment has been in opera+ 
tion in the Birmingham board schools. Attempts have been made from time to time 
by the religious instruction party to get a limited amount of Scriptural explanation 
introduced but these efforts have not prevailed.’ 
i The following are the regulations under which the plan is carried out in Birming- 
am. 
1. The Bible shall be read daily, without note or comment, by the head teacher for 
a quarter of an hour each day. 
2. The portion to be read shall be suitable to the capacity of the children, and shall 
be selected by the head teacher, who shall at the close of each reading make a record 
of the portion read in a book to be provided for the purpose. 
3. The time for such reading shall be between 9:30 and 9:45 a. m., except in the 
case of schools in which religious instruction is being given under the regulations of 
the board dated December 31, 1873, when the time shall be between 4:15 and 4:30 
p.m. on the days when such religious instruction is given, and between 9:30 and 
9:45 a. m. on all other days. 
4, Whenever a parent or guardian shall notify to the head teacher his desire that 
his child he withdrawn from attendance at the reading of the'Bible, such child shall 
receive secular instruction in a separate class room during the time set apart for the 
reading. ; : 
In the absence of regulation, the schools under some of these boards have at some time practiced Bible reading, or prayer, or hymn singing. Hight of the counties referred to, containing 21 of the school hoards, arein Wales.

(1) By the committee of any similar society representing one or more of the religi- 
ous communities of the town ; or 
(2) By the ministers of religion in charge of congregations in the town; or 
(3) By any person willing to give religious instruction, when the application is sus-

ance at one of the departments of any board school. t 
(4). Whenever a parent or guardian shall notify to the head teacher his desire that 
his child shall be withdrawn from attendance at the reading of the Bible, such shall :

MORAL LESSONS. 
21, Moral instruction shall be definitely provided for in the time-table of each school. 
22. Two moral lessons a week, of half an hour each, shall be given to all the chil- 
dren in the boys’ and girls’ schools, and an entry of these lessons shall be made on the 
time-table. In the infants’ schools the number ‘and length of the lessons may be ar- 
ranged by the head mistress. ; 
23. The series should include such subjects as obedience to parent, honesty, truth- — 
fulness, industry, temperance, courage, kindness, perservanee, frugality, and thrift, 
overnment of temper, courtesy, unselfishness, and kindred moral duties. i 
24, The lessons should be of a conversational character, and should be largely en- 
forced by illustrations drawn from daily life. i 
The school boards of three large towns besides Birmingham, viz, Oldham, Hud- 
dersfield, and Swansea (Borough), have adopted Bible reading without note or com- 
ment, and the same plan is also followed by 3J0 smaller boards distributed through 
48 counties. It should be observed, however, that in 93 per cent. of these boards the- 
Bible reading is accompanied with prayers or hymas or with both. In many cases 
the Lord’s prayer only is allowed.    
        PARTICULAR SCHEMES AND REGULATIONS FOR UNDENOMINATIONAL RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION. 
    Of the 2,090 boards that make provision to some extent for religious exercises, 
1,506, or 72 per cent. are found in the category of those that have framed or adopted © 
schemes of undenominational religious instruction. 
The diversity of provision in these is so great that little idea of the character and 
extent of the instruction can be formed without some acquaintance with the details 
of the schemes. 4 i 
For the purpose of affording a clearer view of the situation a few typical schemes, 
are here presented.! 
        
            
  ‘THE LONDON SCHOOL BOARD SCHEME. 
  ' 
The London school ‘board has elaborated a very full syllabus of Bible instruction 
which is followed in all its schools occupying from half to three-quarters of an hour 
daily. The following is the portion applicable to elementary scholars as arranged 
for 1888. Explicit directions as to the carrying out of the scheme are issued for the 
teachers and the results of the instruction are tested by annual and biennial exami- 
nations. i nt 
Tin the selection and arrangement of this matter freo née has been made of a summary of this por 
tion of the report of the commission in the School Board Chronicle, Vol. XLII, No. 976, pp. 421-440,

  _ RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AAT 
(c) That, in regard to any particular school, the board shall consider and determine 
upon any application by managers who may show special cause for the exemption of 
the school from the operation of this regulation in whole or in part. i 
During the time of religious teaching or observances, any children whose parents 
object, under the conscience clause (elementary education act, 1870, section 7), to 
their attending such teaching or observances, may be withheld from the school: 
(a) If the object of withholding them be that they may receive religious instruction 
at the same time in some other place; or ; ; 
(b) If the school be so arranged that they can not receive secular instruction in a 
‘separate room; or 
0) oF he religious instruction or obseryances immediately precede the closing of 
6 school. \ 
All children who attend a school during the time at which religious teaching or 
observances take place, and are withdrawn from such teaching or observances, 
shall receive during that time secular instruction in a separate room, 
While any religious observance or instruction is going on in a board school, none 
of the scholars or teachers shall be employed in any other manner in the same room. 
In every school the period for religious observances and Bible instruction in the 
morning must terminate before 9:45. 
An official examination of the scholars in each school, in secular and religious sub- 
jects, the examination in the latter to be subject to the same conditions and restric- 
tions as apply to religious instruction, and to be conducted within the time set apart 
for such religious instruction, shall be held by the board’s inspectors as soon as pos- 
sible after the expiration of eight months of the school year. 
At least four days before the date fixed for any such examination, notice of it shall 
be sent to the managers by the board; and a copy of the inspector’s report shall be 
forwarded to them as soon as practicable after the examination has been held. 
The syllabus comprises a general three years’ course in reading and instruction, and 
tests for memory work, with separate syllabus for infants. Here is a sample from the 
infant instruction for the ‘lowest school section: ” 
(a) Easy eonversation lessons and very simple hymns on; 
(1) God as the maker of all natural things, the sun, moon, plants, animals, eto. 
(2) The difference between God’s making (creating) and man’s making, showing 
man’s need of tools and materials for his work. 
(3) God as our Father in Heaven, loving, all powerful, and all-knowing (hymn 46), 
(4) Prayer to so great and kind a Father a privilege never to be missed. 
(b) Repetition of some short prayer, hymn, or text by heart. 
(c) Easy conversation lessons about some of the Scripture prints illustrating inci- 
dents in the life of Christ, ¢, g., His birth and childhood, His constant labor of doing 
good, His love of little children, ete. , 
The Hartlepool Board, Durham County, while following the London scheme, agrees 
with the Liverpool Board in providing that Roman Catholic papils numbering ten or 
more shall be instructed from the Douai version of the Bible. 
DIOCESAN SYLLABUSES. é 
Many school boards adopt the syllabus of some one or other of the Church dioceses, 
Thus in Cornwall nineteen boards follow the ‘‘Truro Diocesan Religious Instruc- 
tion Syllabus,” and in Devonshire thirty boards follow the ‘‘ Exeter Diocesan Sylla- 
bus. \ 
In all these cases an examination is conducted by the diocesan inspector. 
._In a few instances where a diocesan syllabus is used some nonconformist member of 
the school board is associated with the diocesan inspector in the work of examination. 
These syllabuses, or, at least, the parts adopted by school boards, are strictly unde- 
nominational. 
Board ScHoors aNd DENOMINATIONAL TEACHING, 
The third year of the operation of the education act of 1870 in certain rural dis- 
tricts in Cambridgeshire and elsewhere, the practice was introduced of transferring 
Church of England schools to school boards under a special agreement whereby the 
church managers retained the use of the school rooms, before or before and after 
secular instruction, for carrying on denominational religious instruction without the 
assistance of the board’s teachers. This practice has extended very considerably 
over some parts of the country and comprises now fifty-five boards in twenty-five 
counties,

4, TB cnuRCH ‘caTRCHISM. AND OTHER UNLAWFUL INSTRUCTION IN BOARD SCHOOLS. 
In the returns to the education department thirty-four school boards located in 
seventeen different counties were found to have been giving instruction in the church 
catechism contrary to the provisions of the act of Parliament. 
‘In every case except one Bible reading with comment was also practiced. 
Upon receiving these returns of illegal practices, the Jords of the committee of the 
privy council addressed the following letter to each of these thirty-four school boards. 
4 
i ' « EpucaTION DEPARTMENT, September 20, 1888. 
«grr: Tam directed to return the inclosed schedule to circular 277, from which it 
appears that the church catechism js tanght in the school belonging to your board. 
**Bofore presenting this return to Parliament, I am directed to call your attention 
+o the fourteenth section of the elementary education act, 1870, and to request that 
you will furnish my lords at your earliest convenience with an explanation as to the 
apparent inconsistency in the practice of your board with the provisions contained 
jn paragraphs 1 and2of that section for undenominational teaching in school board 
schools. 
«J am to request you to return the schedule with your reply. 
“TJ haye, ete., f “¢G, MILLER, 
«or F. C, HopGson.”? 
Their lordships report that “the majority of the boards immediately amended their 
ractice,” but the replies from nine boards were “ unsatisfactory.” 
Another letter was thereupon dispatched to these boards in the following terms: 
f ' « BpucaTIoN DEPARTMENT, November 27, 1888. 
«gry: Adverting to your letter of the ——> Lam directed to state that if any 
art of the church ‘catechism except the Lord’s Prayer, Ten Comm andments, and the 
Apostles’ Creed is taught in a ard school during school hours, my lords will not be 
able to recognize the school as a public elementary school. 
«Tam to request that your poard will pass and communicate to the department 
some formal regulation in conformity with the above direction with respect to the 
religious instruction to be given in their schools. 
“T haye, ete., ‘ 
' “F, C, Hopeson.”? 
To this letter there js no answer on record in the blue book. 
‘The oral testimony presented before the conimissioners must not be overlooked in 
the examination of their report. They were jn session altogether 146 days, 95 of 
which were devoted to hearing witnesses. The information thus elicited is found in 
detail in three large volumes, of which the religious question occupies no small part. 
‘The examination bore not only upon the nature and method of the instruction but 
more particularly upon jts value, The summary of this testimony increases our ac” 
quaintance with the actual state and mode of the instruction, and at the same time 
gives us the opinions of many witnesses and the impression which the commissioners 
THOME ey received from the representations of the men ‘and women whom they inter- 
rogated. 
They haye this testimony particularly. in mind in giving their final impression as 
to the nature and yalue of the religious instruction actually given in all public 
elementary schools. Upon this subject they say:?, 
« Biret, as regards voluntary schools, a comprehensive answer drawn from official 
records can be given only in the case of those Chureh of England schools which are 
visited annually by the diocesan inspectors. From the yolume issued by the National 
Society, in which their reports are collected, a very favorable opinion would be 
gathered, on the whole, of the quality of that instruction in the majority of Church 
of England schools reported on. Several witnesses, of wide experience, have likewise 
een examined by Us as to the nature of the religious teaching given in these schools. 
They entirely repudiate the idea which has been sometimes put forward, that it con- 
sisted commonly of committing to memory church formularies without explanation. 
Jt is usual, it appears, for the diocesan inspector at his visit to suggest a syllabus of 
instruction for the ensuing year, on which the next examination of the next year 
will be held, the parts of Seripture selected for study or committal to memory being

duty. Ina large proportion of schools, too, Prebendary Roe (a diocesan inspector 
with wide educational experience) tells us that religious teaching is something much

RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS, 449 
better and beyond mere head knowledge. Archdeacon Barber, who has had long 
experience of the same kind in the diocese of Oxford, gave it as his opinion that 
religious and moral training in church schools is as good as it was before 1870, in 
spite of the tendency to crowd it out. Of 3,759 voluntary schools, the managers of 
which sent replies to our circular A3, 3,622 gave religious instruction daily, and 2,976 
were examined in religious teaching, in most cases by a diocesan inspector. The 
reneral inference we draw from the various sources of information open to us is that 
in the class of schools in which religious instruction is obligatory under their trust 
deeds, the religious instruction is quite as good as it was before the passing of the 
education act of 1870, if not a good deal better; and that it is effective, intelligent, 
and practical. The systems of diocesan inspection which have been instituted, both 
for Church of England and Roman Catholic schools since the passing of Mr. Forster’s 
act,! appear to have resulted in more attention being given to religious teaching than 
before. From the first, the Wesleyan Conference, through its connexional educa- 
tion committee, and its locally responsible circuit quarterly meetings and day-school 
committees, has made religious instruction and training the indispensable basis of 
education in its day schools. We have warnings from the teachers in our evidence 
that there is some danger lest the system of special and separate religious inspection 
may lead to a méchanical treatment of sacred subjects, while the religious training 
which influences and elevates life and character may become subordinate to formal 
ané technical instruction. But in the face of much evidence given both by managers 
ond teachers to the value and acceptability of these annual examinations, we do not 
attach much weight to this theoretical objection. 
“*On the whole we are of opinion that greatly as the estimate of the value of the 
religious instruction given in board schools varies with the standpoint from which it 
is regarded by various witnesses, there is good ground for concluding that wheré care 
is bestowed on its organization and sufficient time is allowed for imparting it, it isof a | 
nature to affect the conscience and influence the conduct of the children of whose 
daily training it forms a part. In many of the board schools the teachers accompany 
systematic Bible readings with appropriate comments and explanations; in others 
the: scriptural instruction is restricted by limitations not imposed by the act itself, 
such as that the Bible be read without note or comment, which, we think, must 
greatly lessen its value. * * * 
“The need for annual inspection of religious instruction in board schools, corre- 
sponding to that made by the diocesan inspectors in church schools, in presence es- 
pecially of the strong competition to which religious instruction is exposed by the 
estriction of Government examination to secular subjects, has been recognized in 
dence before us by the representatives of many important school boards; and we 
zather that a movement is extending itself for securing that an annual examination 
should be held with a view to test the efficiency of the scriptural instruction. In the 
ease of such important school boards as those of Leeds, Liverpoo), Salford, and Bris- 
tol, the witnesses who spoke for them informed us that an annual examination was 
already held in their schools on the subject of religious instruction prescribed by their 
respective boards, and was generally conducted by the board’s inspectors. In London, 
wé learn from the chairman (Mr. Diggle) that the school board, not satisfied with the 
examination of representative scholars for the Peek prizes, have recently instructed - 
their inspectors? to examine throughout all the schools they visit in Scripture knowl- 
edgo; and we were informed that the report to the board on the state of Scripture 
knowledge in any school would affect the future prospects ofa teacher. It does not 
appear that the terms of section 76 of the education act of 1870, which limits the right 
to set apart two days in each year for a religious inspection to those schools which 
are not supported by rates, is found to prevent a similar inspection in board schools. 
We think that the same facilities for inspection should be given by law to school 
boards as are allowed under the act of 1870 to the managers of voluntary schools.”    
   
  ’ MORAL TRAINING. 
As to the distinction which they make between religious and moral training, 
the commissioners’ report is not very clear. In their inquiries the two expressions 
were generally associated and it was left to the witnesses to make such discrimina- 
tions as they chose. In general, they also avoided making the distinction. 
In their summary and evidence, however, the commissioners indicate in some 
measure their conception of the scope and nature of moral as distinguished from re- 
ligious training, as will be seen by the following extracts relating to this division of 
the subject :3

«Of the moral training at present given in public elementary schools we may here 
record that of those who have observed this training in action, one witness before us 
spoke of the moral influence exercised in schools as being enormous. Canon Warbur- 
ton, though hi thinks the tendency of the act of 1870 was to diminish attention given 
to moral training, yet expressed himself as much struck with the usefulness of the 
moral lessons given in board schools, Several of the inspectors attribute this influence 
almost more to the personal character and example of the teacher than to any direct, 
moral teaching, and though Mr. Stewart spoke of the moral tone in large town schools 
asdeteriorated, in smaller schools and especially in those in the country, he saw no such 
falling off. As regards tlie returns we have received to aq uestion in our circulars, i. @., 
‘Do parents desire moral training?’ 93 per cent. of voluntary managers, 79 per cent. of 
school boards, 98 per cent. of teachers answer yes. * * * 
“As to the moral training given in the schools, the opportunities permitted to Her 
Majesty’s inspectors of inquiring into the efficiency of moral training have been under 
the existing arrangements necessarily limited, But under the head of discipline they 
are required, as we have explained more fully elsewhere, by a paragraph in the code 
to ascertain that reasonable care is taken by the managers and teachers to bring up 
the children in habits of punctuality, of good manners and language, of cleanliness and 
neatnesss, and also to impress upon the children the importance of cheerful obedience 
to duty, of consideration and respect for others, of honor and truthfulness in word and 
act! ‘The fortunes of this justly valued clause have been various, as we have before 
explained, and we have made inquiry from many witnesses as to the steps taken by 
inspectors to carry out the duties thus laid upon them, and we do not find that they 
are in the habit of doing more than observe and record any indications of the moral 
tone of the school that may present themselves during their examinations, which must 
necessarily be but an imperfect test of the pains taken at other times with the moral 
training. We agree with Mr, Sharpe that it would make a material difference in the 
working of schools if this clause were abolished, since it serves to remind those who 
conduct schools of the importance attached by the state to that moral instruction 
and training which can not be effectively gauged by examination and might other- 
wise be neglected for br nches of teaching which affect the grant. The opportunity 
given by visits without notice is utilized by many inspectors, though less frequently 
than is desirable, for the purpose of assuring themselves that the moral,tone of the 
schools so far it asit is sie ted in habits of personal cleanliness, propriety of language, 
and a decent use of the school premises is satisfactory. The article, therefore, is not 
to be regarded as a dead letter. 
“We are strongly of opinion that much greater support should be given by the state 
to the normal element of training in our schools, almost the only reference to such 
matters, as far as the state is concerned, being that under the head of discipline in the 
éode to which we have already alluded, and which, being only introduced in 1876, 
has already, as we haye shown, been once withdrawn by the department, in 1882, 
andmay be removedin any year. We recommend, therefore, that general fundamental 
ahd fixed instructions should be laid down as to moral training, making it an essen- 
tial condition of the efficiency of a public elementary school that it should be held 
to comprise such matters as instruction in duty and reverence to parents, honor dnd 
truthfulness in word and act, honesty, purity, temperance, consideration and respect 
for others, obedience, cleanliness, good manners, duty to country, the discouragement 
of bad language and the like. i i ¥ 
“And as we have found with regret that in recent years this branch of the inspect- 
or’s duty has not received the attention it deserved, we therefore think it necessary. 
to make it a distinct recommendation that it should be considered the first duty of 
Her Majesty’s inspectors to inquire into and report upon the moral training and con- 
dition of the schools under the various heads set forth above and to impress upon 
the managers, teachers, and children the primary importance of this essential element 
of all education.” ‘i 
   
      
   
  PROPOSITIONS ADVANCED BY ADVOCATES OF PURELY SECULAR INSTRUCTION. 
The principal witnesses who advocated before the commission the exclusion of re- 
ligious teaching from all public elementary schools, naturally proposed to supply this 
teaching by other, and as they think, better means. 
‘With respect to these propositions the commissioners observe :° 
“Two alternate plans have been laid before us by the limited number of witnesses 
who have proposed to remove religious instruction from the recognized programme of 
school teaching. The plan of religious teaching which they appear to favor most is 
simply to leave the matter to the zeal of the various denominations acting through 
Sunday-schools and other voluntary agencies. The other proposal is to organize a

  RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS. ABL 
system of religious instruction on the school premises, to be given daily by volunteers, 
either before or after school hours.; Both proposals, it will be seen, rest on the as- 
sumption that the children now compelled by law to attend the school for a certain 
number of hours daily would be induced by persuasion voluntarily to attend at other 
times for the sake of this supplementary instruction. Dr. Crosskey, the chief advo- 
caté of these views, was closely pressed as to the probability of this assumption being 
realized, but he failed to satisfy us that there was reasonable ground for believing 
that out of school hours the voluntary attendance of children could be counted on to 
receive the religious teaching which is on all hands admitted to be necessary for 
thee te 
‘« Byidence has been laid before us showing that, at least in large towns, many day 
scholars are not in regular attendance at any Sunday-school, and among the absentees 
a large proportion will naturally belong to the neglected classes. On these it is espe- 
cially desirable that religious influences should be brought to bear, and yet, if no 
other provision be made for their religious instruction during the week, they will 
practically go withoutit. In support of this branch of his scheme, Dr. Crosskey could 
only express his belief that 75 per cent. of the children in Birmingham board schools 
attended some Sunday-school, leaving one-quarter of the whole unprovided with re- 
ligious instruction from this source. According to the evidence of another member of 
that board, 4 years ago there were as many as 25,000 day scholars in Birmingham 
alone not attending Sunday-school, though many of these may have been infants too 
young to attend.” 
In connection with this statement on the part of the commissioners it is interesting 
to recall certain public utterances made at different times by Mr. Mundella. When 
that gentleman was vice-president of the committee of council on education, and vir- 
tual head of the education department, he was elected also to serve 1 year as 
president of the Sunday-schoolunion, While uniting the two offices in his own per- 
son he made an address at Glasgow in which he is reported as saying: ‘The result of 
my inquiries is this, that just as we increase the number on the rolls of our day 
schools we are increasing the number on the rolls of our Sunday-schools.. In the 
great town! that I represent we have compulsion in vigorous operation. I say that 
in the burgh that I represent, although we have done everything that we possibly 
could to bring the children into the day school, a careful and accurate computation of 
the number on the roll of the Sunday-school shows that there is a larger num- 
ber attending the Sabbath-schools than there is attending the day schools, and I 
have been told that it is the samein this city of Glasgow. Thatis surely a hopeful 
feature for the moral and religious aspect of education. It means that the children 
that go to Sunday-school go instructed, with the facts of history and the knowledge 
of religion in their minds, They go with their minds receptive and prepared to re- 
ceive religious impressions. They do not require to be taught with the drudgery 
which I experienced as a Sunday-school teacher, when I had to teach lads as big as 
myself to put three or four letters together. They are open and receptive, and the 
work is easier for the teacher.” 
Tp a speech made in August, 1889, in the House of Commons, in the course of a debate 
upon a proposition to increase the education budget for 1888-89, Mr. Mundella ex- 
pressed the belief thatthere was more and better religious teaching to-day than at any’ 
time during thiscentury. There was, according to him, an irreligious England nearly 
a century ago, when Joseph Lancaster began to teach children to read and spell texts; 
but now there were 4,600,000 children under instruction, and almost every child was 
receiving good, solid, religious instruction. A clergyman of the Church of England, 
a member of the school board committee, had written a letter to him stating that the 
religious instruction of the school board in London was at least equal to and in most 
cases better than the religious instruction ofthe voluntary schools; and that was 
the case throughout the country. There were, in proportion to the population, 40 
per cent, more in Sunday-schools than there were in 1851, and the number on the 
register was 5,200,000, or 500,000 more than on the register of day schools. 
The weight that should be attached to Mr. Mundella’s testimony may be inferred 
from the fact that he was originally appointed upon the commission whose reportis 
before us, but resigned his seat at the beginning of the sittings on account of the 
pressure of other official duties. 
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE COMMISSIONERS, 
The deliberations of the commissioners resulted as was to have been anticipated, 
in a majority and a minority report. 
The principal conclusions and recommendations of the majority respecting relig- 
ious and moral instruction are here presented.

“While we desire,” they say, ‘‘to secure for the children in the public elementary 
schools the best and most thorough instruction in secular subjects suitable to their 
years, and in harmony with the requirements of their future life, we are also unani- 
mously of the opinion that their religious and moral training is a matter of still 
higher importance alike to the children, the parents, and the nation. That there 
can be no doubt from the statement of the witnesses, whether favorable or hostile to 
teaching religion in day schools, and from the testimony afforded by the action of 
poth school boards and voluntary schools, as to the opinion of the country generally 
on the subject of religious and moral training in day schools, and that all the evi- 
dence is practically unavimous as to the desire of the parents for the religious and 
moral training of their children. 
“That to secularize elementary education would be a violation of the wishes of 
parents, whose views in such a matter are, we think, entitled to the first considera- 
tion. - 
“That the only safe foundation on which to construct a theory of morals, or to 
secure high moral conduet,is the religion which our Lord Jesus Christ has taught the 
world. That as we look to the Bible for instruction concerning morals, and take its 
words for the declaration of what is morality, so we look to the same inspired source 
for the sanctions by which men may bo led to practice what is there taught, and for 
instruction concerning the helps by which they may be enabled to do what they 
have learned to be right. 
“That the evidence does not warrant the conclusion that religious and moral 
training can be amply provided otherwise than through the medium of elementary 
schools, ‘ 
“That, in the case of a considerable number of children, if they do not receive 
religious instruction and training from the teachers in the public elementary schools, 
they will receive none, and that this would be a matter of the gravest concern to the 
state. 
“That all registers should be marked before the religious teaching and observ- 
ances begin, scrupulous care being taken, in accordance with the letter and spirit of 
the education acts, to provide for the case of children whose parents object to such 
teaching and observances. 
“hat it is of the highest importance that the teachers who are charged with the 
moral training of the scholars should continue to take part in the religious instrue- 
tion, and that any separation of the teacher from the religious teaching of the school 
would be injurious to the moral and secular training of the scholars. 
“That we ean not recommend the plan which has been suggested of ‘religious in- 
struction to be given by voluntary teachers on the school premises out of school 
hours. That such a plan would be no efficient substitute for the existing system of 
utilizing the school staff and the hours of school attendance for this purpose, a sys- 
tem which has taken deep root in the country and appears to give general satisfac- 
tion to the parents. ° 
“That the state can not be constructively regarded as endowing religious educa- 
tion, when, under the conditions of the act of 1870, it pays annual grants in aid of 
voluntary local effort for secular instruction in schools in which religious instruc- 
tion forms part of the programme. 
“That the fourteenth section of the act of 1870, which forbids any denominational 
catechism or formulary to be taught in board schvols, merely provided for perfect 
neutrality among Christian denominations. It does not exclude from the schools 
instruction in the religion of nature,that is, the existence of God and of natural moral- 
‘ity, which, apart from belief in the existence of God, can not be intelligibly taught 
or understood. 
“That the conscience clause is strangely misconstrued when it is understood to 
‘prevent the possibility of any allusion to religious subjects during the ordinary 
hours of instruction,’ or to preclude a teacher from ‘bringing the sanction of the 
Christian religion to bear’ on any moral offense, such as lying, which requires atten- 
tion during these hours. 
“That inasmach as parents are compelled to send their children to school, it is just 
atd desirable that, as far as possible, they should be enabled to send them to a school 
suitable to their religious convictions or preferences. 
“That in schools of a denominational character, to which parents are compelled 
to send their children, the parents have a right to require an operative conscience 
clause, and that care be taken that the children shall not suffer in any way in conse- 
quence of their taking advantage of the conscience clause. 
“That the absence of any substantiated case of complaint, aud the general drift of 
the evidence, convince us that the conscience clause is carefully observed both by 
teachers and managers. 
“That we recognize, nevertheless, the importance of removing, if possible, any

suspicion of unfair play or undue influence in the administration of the conscience 
clause from the minds of those who entertain such impressions ; and any further pre- 
cautions which might tend in that direction, without compromising still higher inter- 
ests, are deserving of the most careful consideration. ( 
“That, greatly as the estimate of the valne of the religious instruction given in 
board schools varies with the standpoint from which it is regarded, there is good 
ground for concluding that where care is bestowed on the organization of such 
instruction, and sufficient time is allowed for imparting it, it is of a nature to affect 
the conscience and influence the conduct of the children of whose daily training it 
forms a par 
i That it is much to be hoped that the religious and moral training in all element- 
ary schools may be raised to the high standard which has been already reached in 
many of them. ‘ 
“That exactly the same facilities to hold annual examinations of their schools in 
religious knowledge should be given by law toschool boards as are now allowed under 
section 76 of the act of 1870 to the managers of voluntary schools. 
“That increased support should be given by the state to the moral element of 
training in our schools, almost the only reference to the importance of such matters 
made by the State being that which is made in the code under the head of discipline, 
“That general fundamental and fixed instructions to Her Majesty’s inspectors 
should be laid down as to moral training, making it an essential condition of the effi- 
ciency of a public elementary school that its teaching should comprise such matters 
as instruction in duty and reverence to parents, honor and truthfulness ia word and 
act, honesty, consideration and respect for others, obedience, cleanliness, good man- 
ae purity, temperance, duty to country, the discouragement of bad language, and 
the like. ’ 
“That it should be the first duty of Her Majesty’s inspectors to inquire into and 
report upon the moral training and condition of the schools under the various heads 
set forth and to impress upon the managers, teachers, and children the primary im- 
portance of this essential element of all education.”

. MINORITY REPORT. 
The differences of opinion between the minority and the majority of the commis- 
sioners were radical and related as much to the ‘‘ general tone and argument of the 
report as to its summary of conclusions.” Hence the signatures of the minority to 
the report of the majority would have conveyed a false impression of their position, 
even if important reservations had been noted. They emphasize in particular their 
utter disagreement with the majority in respect to the matter of religious training. 
While recognizing ‘‘that the formation of the character of children attending ele- 
-mentary schools is of permanent importance alike to the children, the parents, and 
the nation,” they express the fear ‘that the recommendations regarding religious 
instruction contained in the report of the majority would lead to a renewal of bitter 
disputes and rivalries which were, and are, happily subsiding. These differences 
alone,” they say, ‘‘ even in the absence of any others, compel us to set forth our con- 
clusions in this report. 
With respect to the recommendations of their colleagues, they say: ‘Having 
regard to the great diversities of opinion among our countrymen on religious subjects, 
and having serious doubts whether moral training can be satisfactorily tested by 
inspection or examination, we do not believe that the recommendations contained in 
ne portion of the report of our colleagues would promote the object which we 
esire. 
“We recognize that for the great mass of the people of this country, religious and 
moral teaching are most intimately connected, and that, in their judgment, the value 
and effectiveness of the latter depend, to a very great extent, upon religious sanc- 
tions. We think that the present liberty of religious teaching, recognized by the 
law for local managers, is an ample security that so long as the prevalent opinion 
     
-P-A-G-E-526
            4 ' ‘ 
454 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. f 
of the country remains unchanged, the education of the children and the formation 
of their abana will be based upon those principles which are dear to the mass of 
the people. uf 
“Bearing in mind the fact that, in only 8 percent. of the voluntary schools 
answering our circular were the registers finally closed before the religious teaching 
and observances,.and that about the same proportion appeared in the returns from 
head teachers, we dissent from the proposal that the present liberty of managers 
should be interfered with by requiring them finally to close all registers before the 
religious teaching and observances. At the same time, in the interest of discipline 
and punctuality, we should be glad to see any regulations introduced which would 
not be exposed to the charge of indirectly enforcing that attendance on religious 
teaching which should be voluntary; we therefore recommend that, where there is 
but one room and one teacher, attendance be not compulsory till after the time of 
religious teaching, but where there is more than one teacher and a class-room, that 
children withdrawn from religious teaching, be given secular instruction in a sepa- 
rate room. f 
“We dissent from the statement that the fourteenth section of the act of 1870 
merely provided for perfect neutrality among Christian denominations. Jews, free 
thinkers, and any other persons who refuse to intrust the religious teaching of their 
children to others, are all equally entitled, both under section 14 and under section 7, 
to a perfect exemption from any instruction in religious subjects at any time while 
the school is open. 
«We think that the evidence shows that the moral teaching under our present 
school system bas been most valuable, and this is given throughout the whole school 
time largely by the personal influence of the teacher, and is not confined to specific 
religious teaching, but can also be given through secular illustrations. 
“While we attach the very greatest importance to the moral element in our 
national education, we differ from our colleagues in their recommendation that it is 
to the state we should look for increased support to the moral element of training in 
our schools. We would rather look to the local interest taken and to the influence 
that managers and parents can bring to bear on the conduct of the school, together 
with the personal character of thé teacher for maintaining that high moral standard 
among the scholars which it is the object of the state to secure. While we approve 
of the present requirement that the managers shall satisfy the inspector that all 
reasonable care is taken in the moral training of the children, we think it would be 
a misfortune if in any way the duty of fully ascertaining the moral conduct of the 
school were transferred to the inspector from the managers. The inspector can notice 
manifest faults of conduct, but he can not really estimate the full value of the higher 
moral influences that are found pervading a thoroughly good school. 
“While we insist upon moral teaching and believe that more systematic moral 
teaching, if given with earnestness, would have a very valuable influence on the 
characters of the scholars, we think that any systematic inspection of morals by Her 
Majesty’s inspector, such as is suggested in the chapter on the parliamentary grant, 
swould not only be of no value, but would, where the local managers and teachers did 
not themselves feel the importance of moral influences, be of positive injury as lead- 
ing to hypocritical and mechanical teaching of that which must come from a free 
expression of conscientious conviction.” 1

Extract from the address of the Right Hon. J. Stansfeld, M, P.: 
“There were, ” the speaker said, ‘2,478 parishes in school-board districts, and there 
, were 9,684 parishes outside school-board districts, and containing practically only 
church schools, Was this to be accepted as the permanent rule and condition of 
things? No. The church sehool party argued that it hurt their consciences as much

to which they contributed as it hurt the consciences of nonconformists to be obliged 
to pay for church schools. ‘There was, however, no parallel between those two cases,

did they exist for? They spoke of the conscience clause as a sufficient defense for non- 
conformists, but at that very moment they were endeavoring to undermine it. * * 
‘‘Nonconformists knew from experience that the conscience clause was no sufficient 
protection. He should regard it as a social and political offense to force him, a dis- 
senter, to send his child to a church school, one of the objects of which was to but- 
tress up the Established Church.” 4 
From address of Mr. A. H. D. Acland, M.P.:  - L 
One of his own constituents in a pit village had sent him a letter, in which he said: 
“The school board has greatly improved the tone of workingmen. The working- 
men had begun to think tor themselves. At the last school-board election there were 
nine candidates—one, gentleman, three farmers, and five workingmen, and four 
workingmen gotin and one farmer.” In contrast to that he would refer to the par- 
ish in which he himself lived in North Wales. There were 1,600 people in that par- 
ish, and a very big church, with perhaps an average congregation of 25 or 30. Out 
of the 1,600 at least 1,500 were nonconformists. ‘There were two schools there, and 
the sole management of them was in the hands of the clergy. The result was that 
the schoois were starved in a way which was perfectly scandalous. He remembered 
the old dame schools, and he never saw any elementary schools more like those than 
the school which was within a very short distance of his own house. There were men 
in that parish perfectly competent and most anxious to take part in the arrangements 
for the education of the children, but they were poor people and could not raise a 
school of theirown, In another parish, not far distant, a great struggle was going 
on. For several years they got on very well, because the clergyman was a sensible 
man, but his successor said ‘‘I will double the fees for nonconformist children.” 
‘Then the poor farmers and laborers set about getting a school of their own, and they 
were determined to have one under the control of the majority of the people. The 
position of Wales in this matter was very grave. Not only were the people bearing 
the expense of maintaining a multitude of chapels throughout the land, but if they 
were to have any effective control over the education of their children they must 
pay for the education too. In many country parishes the great harmonium question 
was more important than that of education. Before all things it was thought neces- 
sary that the teacher should be a good player on the harmonium. An inspector said 
to him the other day, ‘‘The teacher of this school is almost. utterly unfit to carry it 
on. Ihave been to the clergyman about it, but he said, ‘He has just got his old 
mother come to live with him, and that will make it impossible to remove him.’” 
When it was remembered what was at stake in this matter, such considerations 
ought not to be allowed fora single moment to standin the way. Harmoniumsand 
old mothers were all very well, but the education of the country was of much more 
importance. They could not afford now anything which would drag education back- 
wards. The questions of improved buildings, trained teachers, higher elementary 
and secondary education were now vital matters. Their motto must be efficiency 
everywhere and progress wherever we could obtain it. 
Rev. Mr. Goddard, of Keswick, stated that in that town the number of children on 
the school roll was 630, of whom 360 attended nonconformist Sunday-schools, and 
yet there was not asingle day-school there in which unsectarian education could be 
obtained. 
Extract from speech of Mr. T, Snape, of Liverpool: 
Commenting upon the recommendation of the royal commission to the effect that, 
inasmuch as parents were compelled to send their children to schoo!, they ought to 
be enabled to send them to a school that was suitable to their religious convictions 
or preferences. Mr. Snape said: ‘That might be a very satisfactory view to the 
majority who were interested in Chureh of England schools, which alone existed in 
some 10,000 parishes of the country ; but if it were followed out to its logical conelu- 
sion it meant that those who had no faith in some of the teachink given in those 
schools had a right also to have a school in accordance with their ideas of true edu- 
cation and religion. In those 10,000 parishes the children of all nonconformists 
were compelled to attend Church of England schools, many of them being ignorant 
of the power which the conscience clause gave them, or unwilling, for fearof obloquy, 
to take advantage of it. The religious instruction consisted largely of the doctrines 
of the church catechism, and children who never had godfathers or godmothers were 
taught to say that their godfathers and godmothers gave them their names in bap- 
tism, and that in baptism they were made ‘ members of Christ and inheritors of the 
Kingdom of Heaven.’ Many of them held such.doctrines to be pernicious and untrue, 
and they ought not to be called upon to submit to such instruction being continued.”. 
From paper presented by Rey. Dr. Crosskey, of Birmingham: : 
“Tf the principle of representative government has to be alive in England, the 
time must come sooner or later when every school in receipt of public money during 
its ordinary secular hours must be under public control. What was called the de- 
nominational system was not in any way capable of satisfying the educational wants 
of the people, and no part of the population should be doomed to an inferior educa-

8-89, 
tion in order to support any ecclesiastical party. Sir William Hart-Dyke had de- 
clared that next session the Government will have proposals to make. ‘Ihe state of 
our educational institutions was such that any proposal made rust inevitably extend 
or retard the development of the school-board system. If proposals were made for 
improvements, the plea of denominationalists would ‘ye that they had no money, 
and they would ask for increased funds. - Experts knew perfectly well how voluntary 
schools could bo nourished and sustained entirely apart from throwing them on the 
rates. The disclaimers of the Government did not touch the heart of the matter. 
In throwing over the claim to put these schools on the rates they were simply throw- 
ing Jonah to the whale in order to lighten the ship ; but most jndubitably they did 
not say that they were the friends of schools managed by the people in the people’s 
interest. Nothing but a definite and distinct policy would save the real cause of 
education at this crisis.” f 
From address of Rev. Hugh Price Hughes, M. A.+ ; 
“No denomination, except the Church of England, had introduced any sectarian 
religious difficulty in connection with education, put the Church of England had 
never yielded a single point to religious freedom in the schools during all this cen- 
tury, except at the point of the bayonet, Even now this boasted conscience clause 
avas a dead letter in the rural districts, except where there was a school board and a 
vigilant public opinion to protect the poor. Tu 1886 there were 108 poroughs, 73 urban 
sanitary districts, and over 10,000 parishes, out of a total of nearly 15,000 parishes, 
without a school board or w poard school, and in all those places the children were 
forced into sectarian schools. ‘Ven millivn people were without the protection ofschool 
poards. The sectarian schools into which they were forced were the private property 
of the clergymen, and the rate-payers had no ‘control whatever over them. ‘The par- 
ish priest did what he liked there, and yet those very schools received nearly 2 
millions of public money every year, and they now had the modesty to ask for 2 
millions more. By a grim joke they were called ‘ voluntary schools.” He did not eall 
them so, for he was not going to tell a lie to please anybody. Out of a total of 7 mill- 
jons spent this year in education, the voluntary contribution amounted to only 
£744,000, The main and constant object of the excellent clerical gentlemen who 
carried on what they called voluntary schools was not to educate the people, put to 
Henefit their own sect. his ancient country had, at the present moment, the most 
inefficient educational system in Europe, and the most unsuitable buildings for school 
purposes, Some of those places were dark and unhealthy and had tile or stone floors. 
in one of these places, we were told, the rough unplastered interior resembled a sta- 
ple more than a school room. English people allowed the children of the poor to be 
driven into a stable in deference to sectarianism. ‘There were hundreds of country 
schools in which they taught only the three R’s; and a little needlework to the girls. 
There was no history, no geography, and no science. The peasantry of England were 
peing sacrificed on the altar of sectarianism and bigotry. ‘Another impeachment to 
pe brought against the voluntary system was that it provided most inefficient teachers. 
Many of the head teachers could not even pass ‘the entrance examination of the train- 
ing colleges. The children were encouraged toleave the schools after they had passed, 
the fourth standard. It was a monstrous thing that country magistrates aud people 
of that sort should have any option whatever as to the standard which children were 
to pass before leaving the school. According to the testimony of the recent Blue 
  . Book, the fees in the voluntary schools were arbitrarily raised in the fourth and upper 
standards in order to drive away the children. 
“There were 4,359 sectarian schools with uncertified head teachers. ee % he, 
sectarian teachers were wretchedly paid. There were 11,079 head teachers belonging 
to the wealthy Church of England who received in 1886 only between £40 and £50 
‘a, year each, and yet they were the educational Gibeonites—the hewers of wood and 
drawers of water for the parish priest. Tf voluntary school education was to be 
made efficient, it must not be subordinated to the ambitious designs of a proselyting 
sect, but it must be controlled by men whose highest aim was elficiency. At pres- 
ent, in a majority of parishes, the day school could pe used, and in many was used, 
as an instrument to stamp out nonconformity. People living in towns had very little 
idea of what was going on jn that direction in country parishes. He would call as 
his first witness Dean Gott, the former vicar of Leeds. He wrote: “T hold the polit- 
jeal dissenter as an enemy of God and his country.’ Thus the late Samuel Morley 
and the late Sir William ‘McArthur, and he believed that he might say the present 
Jord mayor of London, were ‘all enemies of their country. ‘Was a clergyman who 
held such an opinion as that fit to have the uncontrolled management of the educa- 
tion of the poor? The rector of a village near Basingstoke had recently asserted in 
a pastoral letter that men would be asked on the Day of Judgment whether they had 
attended church or chapel, and he added: ‘Political dissent. is hateful to me, and I 
pelieve that it is hateful to the Almighty.’ Such men as these had at the present 
moment the uncontrolled. education of thousands of nonconformists. He had no 
quarrel with them if he would leave them alone. He would let them teach, if they

liked, that overy man who entered a Methodist chapel committed asin against God, 
but they must not teach it in the name of Eygland, and they must not teach it with 
the money of the country.” 
EXTRACTS FROM THE FOREIGN RETURNS MADE TO THE COMMISSION SHOWING WHAT 
IS DONE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN THE MATTER OF RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION 
AND Mora TRAINING IN SOME OF THE LEADING COUNTRIES OF EUROPE AND IN 
CERTAIN British COLONIES. / 
The following were the questions pertaining to religious instruction embodied in 
the form issued for foreign countries. For convenience of reference the original 
numbering is preserved : b 
Question 16. Do the schools of the state give religious as well as secular instruc- 
tion? And, if so, of what nature? By whom is it given? 
Question 17. If not, are the school-houses used out of school hours for religious 
instruction ? x 
Question 18. Is any provision made for the moral training of the children in the 
schools by the ordinary teachers in the ordinaryschool hours? If so, state what means 
are taken to secure it, 
Question 19. Is the religious instruction obligatory on all the scholars? If not, 
what provision is made for the religious instruction of the minority? 
Question 20. Are the teachers in the schools exclusively lay? 
RETURNS. 
$ AUSTRIA, 
16, They do; and the religious instruction is under the supervision of the church 
authorities of the various confessions. In places where no clergyman is available to 
give regular religious instruction the secular teacher can be charged (with the con- 
sent of the church authority) with the instruction in religion of the scholars of his 
own creed according to the directions of the school inspector. If any church or reli- 
gious body fails to provide for the instruction of its members, the provincial school 
authority takes whatever steps are necessary. 
18. The primary schools provide ‘‘moral and religious” as well as secular instruc- 
tion. 
19. Yes, As to the religious instruction of the minority, its own church authorities 
must provide for it. The parents must also secure domestic religious instruction. 
20. Any Austrian subject may become a teacher; consequently non-laymen are not 
excluded. f 
Bavania. ; 
17. No. . 
18. Yes; the teachers are bound to look after the moral training as well as the 
education of pupils, and the teachers must support the parents in the bringing up of 
their children, 
19, Yes. 
20, As a general rule all are lay. Exception: Convent schools; small parishes, 
where the parish priest is also teacher. 
BELGIUM. 
  
  16. The communes can inscribe religious and moral instruction at the head of the 
curriculum of all or of some of their elementary schools. This instraction is given 
at the commencement or at the end of the school hours; children, at the request of 
their parents, are exempted from attending such instruction. 
In many schools the (Catholic) catechism is taught and sacred history. Generally 
speaking the teachers give the instruction in religion under the control of the 
_clergy. 
17. No. 
18. Generally speaking, moral training is united to the religious teaching. At the 
sane time, in various subjects, such as reading, mother-tongue history, the teacher 
does not lose sight of moral education, nor does he do so during the play hours. . ‘ 
19, Religious instruction is not obligatory; the following guarantees are provided 
by the law for the rights of the minority: s 
(a) In the case of a commune in which twenty heads of families haying children 
of school age ask that their children should be exempted from assisting at religious

  instruction the King can, at the request of the parents, oblige 
ganize for the use of these children one or more special classes. . 
(b) If in spite of the request of twenty heads of families having children of school 
age the commune refuse to inscribe the teaching of their religion in the school cur- 
riculum or hinder such instruction being given by the ministers of their religion or 
by persons approved of by these latter, the Government can, at the request of the par- 
ents, adopt one or more private schools, as may be requisite, provided they meet the 
conditions prescribed for adoption by the commune. t 
20. The law and the regulations make no difference between the laymen and the 
members of religious orders. In the communal schools the vast majority of the male 
and female teachers arelay;in the adopted schools there are a great number of 
monks and nuns. i ¢   \ 4

FRANCE. 
16. No religious instruction is given in the public schools; but Thursday must be 
a whole holiday in order to enable parents to have their children taught in the re- 
ligion to which they belong outside of the precincts of the school. During the week 
preceding their confirmation (first communion) the teacher will allow children to 
pe absent trom school, even during regular school hours, in order to enable them to 
perform their religious duties and attend chureh if necessary. (Decree of July 18, 
1882, art. 5). A 
17.: No. +e ' ; . 
18. Yes. Article 1 of the law of March 28, 1882, declares moral and civie instrue- 
tion as a part of the regular curriculum of compulsory subjects to be taught by the 
ordinary teachers in the ordinary school hours. Special directions with regard to 
the way of teaching these subjects are included in the ‘‘prograr mes de l’enseigne- 
ment des écoles primaires.” [Programmes of subjects prescribed for primary schools. ] 
19. See answer to question 16. 
20. Yes, in principle. (Loi du 30 October, 1886, articles 17 and 18.) There are 
still some teachers in the public schools (of both sexes) belonging to religious corpo- 
rations, but after 5 years from date of above-mentioned law none but lay teachers 
are to be employed in boys’ schools; as to girls’ schools no limit has been tixed as yet. 
; MORAL DUTIES. 
The programme of instruction in moral duties prescribed for use in the French 
elementary schools is a yery remarkable one. The following is a translation of its 
principal portions. ' i 
OBJECT OF THE INSTRUCTION. 
Masters and mistresses shall teach the children during the whole duration of their 
school life their duties towards their family, their country, their fellow creatures, to- 
wards themselves, and towards God. 4 
METHOD OF THE INSTRUCTION. ; 
The method shall be simple and familiar. Morality shall be combined with every 
' part of their instruction ; with the games and recreations of children, and their whole 
gonduct. The aim should be at oné and the same time to form the mind, the heart, 
and the character. 
DIVISION OF THE CLASSES. ‘ 
{ 
Infant department from jive to seven years.—1. Very simple conversations interspersed 
in all the work of the class and during recreation. : 
2. Short pieces of poetry explained and learned by‘heart. Moral tales related to 
the class, followed by questions adapted to bring out their meaning, and to ascertain 
whether they have been understood by the children, Short songs. 
3. Spécial attention by the mistress to children in whom she has observed any signs 
of vice or other faults. 4 
Elementary classes from seven to nine year's of age.—1. Familiar conversations. Read- 
tags with explanations (narratives, examples, precepts, parables, and fables). Ap- 
peals to the heart. } 
2. Practical exercises tending to set moral principles in action among the class. 
(1) By observation of individual character, noting the tendencies of the children 
in order gently to correct their failings or bring out their good qualities. 
(2) By the intelligent application of school discipline as a means of education, dis- 
tinguishing carefully the failure in duty from the simple infraction of a regulation, 
pointing out the relation between faults and punishment, ete. | : 
(3) By an incessant appeal to the child’s own moral sense, making children ‘fre-

quently judge of their own conduct, leaving them free to speak and to act with the 
certainty that they will soon find out for themselyes the consequences of their own 
faults and errors. as eMC eS 
4, By the correction of gross vulgar notions, popular superstitions, belief in wizards, 
ghosts, or in the influence of certain numbers. 1 
5, By deducing from the facts observed by the children themselves the conse- 
quences of the vices of which at times they have the example before their eyes. 
Intermediate classes from nine to eleven.—1. The child in the family: (1) Dutiestowards ~ 
arents and grandparents; obedience, respect, love, gratitude; to help his parents in 
Heit labor, to comfort them in their sickness, to succour them in their old age. 
(2) Duties of brothers and sisters: To love one another; protection due from the 
elder to the younger—effect of example. 
(3) Duties towards servants: To treat them with courtesy and kindness. 
2. The child at school: Diligence, docility, work, decorum; duties towards his 
teacher and towards his school fellows. , 
3. Country: France, its greatness and its misfortunes; duties towards country and 
towards society. 
Duties which the child owes to himself as to the body: Cleanliness, soberness, 
danger of drunkenness, gymnastics. 
Outward goods: Economy, avoidance of debt, baneful effects of the passion of 
gambling, not to be over fond of money, prodigality, avarice. 
Labor: Obligatory on all men; nobility of manual labor. ‘ 
The mind: Truthfulness and sincerity, avoidance of falsehood, personal dignity, 
and self-respect. 
Modesty: Not to be blind to one’s own faults; avoidance of pride, vanity, coquetry, 
frivolity; to be ashamed of ignorance and idleness; courage in danger and in misfor- 
tune; patience, readiness, and promptitude; dangers of anger. 
Kindness to animals: Not to cause them any needless suffering. 
Duties which he owes to, other men: Justice and charity; to do to others what you 
would wish them to do to you; to do no injury either to the life, the person, the goods, 
or the reputation of another; kindness, fraternity, tolerance, respect for the belief 
of others. 
Throughout this course of teaching the teacher shall take as a starting point the 
existence of conscience, of the moral law, and of the principle of obligation. He is 
to appeal to the sentiment and to the idea of duty, to the sentiment and to the idea 
of responsibility ; he is to make no attempt to demonstrate their existence by specu-— 
lative reasoning. 
Duties toward God: The teacher is not called upon to deliver a course of academ- 
ieal lectures upon the nature and attributes of God. The-teaching he has to give to 
all, without distinction, is limited to two points: 
First, he teaches his scholars not to pronounce the name of God lightly. He is 
strictly to associate in their minds, with the idea of the First Cause and of the Per- 
fect Being, a sentiment of respect and veneration ; and, in the next place, he shall 
aim at making the child understand that the chief homage which he owes to the Deity 
is obedience to His laws as they are revealed to him by conscience and by reason. 
Higher classes from eleven to thirteen year's of age.—Conversations, readings, practical 
exercises as in the foregoing classes. This higher course embraces in addition, in a 
regular series of lessons, the number and order of which may vary, elementary in- 
struction in morality generally, and more especially of social morality; in accordance 
with the following programme: 
1. The family: Duties of parents and children; reciprocal duties of masters and 
servants; family spirit. 
2. Society: Necessity and advantages of society ; justice, a condition of every so- 
ciety ; mutual dependence and relationships ; fraternity amongst men. 
Application and development of the idea of justice; respect for human life and 
liberty ; respect for property, for one’s own word, and one’s own honor, and also for 
the reputation of others; probity, equity, loyalty, delicacy; respect for the opinions 
and belief of others. 
Application and development of the idea of charity or fraternity; its different 
degrees; duties of benevolence, of gratitude, of toleration, clemency, etc.; self- 
coe the highest form of charity; show that it may find some place in every- 
ay life, : y 
3. Country: What we owe to our country—obedience to its laws, military service, 
discipline, self-surrender, military fidelity ; taxes—condemnation of every kind of 
frand upon the State. Of the vote—it is a moral obligation; it ought to be free, con- 
scientious, disinterested, enlightened. Rights which correspond with these duties— 
individual liberty, freedom of conscience, of labor, of association; guaranty for 
the security of the life and property of all. Sovereignty of the nation. Explana- 
tion of the republican device—liberty, equality, fraternity. ey

In each of those chapters on social morality, the attention of the scholar shall be 
called, without entering into metaphysical discussions, to— . 
1. Tho difference between duty and interest, even when they seem to be blended 
together; that is to say, the imperative and disinterested character of duty. 
3. The distinction between the written law and the moral law. The first fixes a 
maximum of requirements which society imposes upon all its members under fear of 
certain prescribed punishments; the second iinposes upon every man in the secret of 
his own conscience, a duty which no outward authority constrains him to fulfill, but 
renee he can not omit without feeling himself culpable towards himself and towards

16. No. As tegards this subject, see articles 22 and 33 of the law. 
17. For that object, in the year 1885, in 298 communes, 620 school premises were 
used by teachers of religion. 
a he answer to this question is contained in Articles 22 and 33 of the law.

16. Religious instruction is only given in cases where it is specially requested, and 
then out of school hours. : 
18. One of the courses of instraction is that of “rights and duties,” and in this 
the teachers are chiefly taken up with moral education, although moral education is 
not forgotten in other branches, as especially those of language and history. 
19, It is obligatory for no one beyond the limits of the Catechism and Holy Scrip- 
ture. (See answer to question No. 16.) 
20. OF 40,000 teachers only 4,000 belong to the regular or secular clergy. The 
remainder are all laymen. 
PRussIA. 
16. In all the elementary schools the religious instruction is compulsory, as well as 
the other branches of instruction. The religious instrnetion is given, according to 
_ the sections 14-21 of the “General Regulations” by the teachers, exceptionally by 
clergymen and by special teachers of religion. 
17° The schoolhouses are sometimes used out of school hours for religious instruc- 
tion, but that is of no consequence at all, nor is it an interior connection with the 
elementary schools. 
18. Hero we can only point ont that the Prussian elementary school in principle 
not only aims at instruction, but as much also at the moral training of the children. 
The plan and the practice of instruction are regulated from this point of view. The 
ordinary teachers take care of the moral training of the children at all hours. 
19. Yes. Also for the religious instruction of the minority provisions are made, 
partially at the expense of the state. For this purpose means are regularly granted 
by the Government.

16. Yes. In the Roman Catholic schools the catechism of that church is taught as 
a regular school subject, In Protestant schools Scripture history and the Gospels are 
taught, and the schools are opened with Bible reading and prayer. The religious in- 
, struction is given by the regular teachers. Z

18. Teachers are required to give lessons upon the subject of good morals as a regu- 
lar part of the course of study.

or Protestant. In the case of mixed schools religious instruction is given in accord- 
ance with the views of the majority, and the minority are exempt from attendance 
at that hour.

16. The law provides that pupils shall be allowed to receive such religious instruc- 
tions as their parents or guardians desire, according to any general regulations pro- 
vided for the organization, government, and discipline of public schools, / 
18. The following are the departmental regulations on this subject: 
Moral and relignous instruction.—No course of moral instruction is prescribed. The 
teacher is expected, however, by his personal example, as well as by the exercise of 
his authority and by instruction, to imbue every\pupil with respect for those moral 
obligations which underlie a well-formed character. Respect for those in authority 
and for the aged, courtesy, true manliness, reverence, truthfulness, honesty, ete., can 
best be inculeated as the occasion arises for referring to them. ‘The religious exer- 
cises of the school should be conducted without haste and with the utmost reverence 
and decorum. . 19. The law enacts that no person shal! require any pupil in any public school to 
read or study in or from any religious book, or to join any exercise of devotion.or re- 
ligion objected to by his or her parents or guardians.

16. Schools under the management of the Protestant section of the board of edu- cation are required to have Bible reading daily, and are opened and closed with prayer. The ten commandments and the Lord’s prayer are also taught, but there is no denominational religious teaching. Schools under the management of the Catho- lic section of the board have a full system of religions teaching by the teachers under direction of the church authorities. 
17. No; except that in rural school districts schoolhouses are frequentl Sunday for church and Sunday-s¢hool purposes. iB Ba cats 18. Moral teaching is prescribed as a subject of instruction by oral lessons in Prot- estant schools, and is included in the religious instruction given in Catholic schools,

    The means taken to secure it are (1) in strict requirements as to character from 
persons applying for a license to teach, and (2) by efficient inspection. 
19, All primary schools in the province being Protestant and Catholic, the require-

    CHAPTER XVII (A). | 
OO-EDUCATION OF THE SEXES. 
SUBSTANCE OF AN ADDRESS DELIVERED BY P. Voss BEFORE THE SIXTH SCANDINA- 
VIAN SCHOOL CONFERENCE IN COPENHAGEN, AUGUST, 1890. 
  
a it 
In his introduction the speaker made humorous reference to the ‘squinting peda- 
gogues” of the eighteenth century, as he called them, or pedagogues who did not 
Jook at a thing from the standpoint of the laws of nature and of life, but_according 
to artificial cut-and-dried theories. The practical and progressive ideas of the eight- 
eenth century did not harmonize, he said, with the pedagogical ideas with which that 
generation was penetrated. | 
In the judgment of the speaker, the means of escaping the tendency to narrow 
views are observation and experience. ‘ 
With regard to co-education, Dr. Voss said that probably he was chosen to intro- 
duce the subject on account of the larger experience of Norwegian educators in this 
matter. But as that country’s own experience is only of short duration, he found 
himself obliged to lead his hearers over the ocean to the great Republic of the West 
and eastward to Finland, which nations for some time have followed the same road 
as the Norwegians. : 
To my knowledge, he said, co-education as a makeshift in public schools with 
slender resources has been practiced in all European centers of civilization ever since 
schools existed, or at least from the moment when nations became conscious that 
svomen have a tight to education as well as men. Starting from this historical be- 
ginning the question ‘arises: Is co-education also admissible in the higher schools, or 
‘do their more complicated courses of study, differing according to the future positions 
and vocations of students, offer decisive obstacles to co-education ? 
At present, he said, I will treat in particular of the elementary schools, 4. ¢., schools 
for children up to 15 to 16 years of age, that period when interior and exterior cir- 
cumstances, as a rulé, naturally prompt the youth to think of his future career, his 
means of livelihood, and consequently of the great importance of directing his school 
education toadefiniteend. It would be useless to enter particularly upon the question 
of the proper status of co-education in universities and gymnasia, in normal schools, 
jn a word, in all classes of higher institutions, which as a general rule are designed 
to be for males or females alone (‘¢ separate” schools). As soon as the conditions — 
and facts which determine the place of co-oducation in the public schools are made : 
sufficiently clear, the pedagogical problem will be solved in its most important part. — 
Itis principally from the elementary schools, or a8 we say in Norway, the middle — 
schools (middelskoler) that we Norsemen have gained our experience. 
The number of higher schools, middle schools, and gymnasia, in Norway, where 
co-education in a greater or less ‘extent has been tried up to the present time may be — 
put down at forty. In about thirty middle schools with mixed schools belonging 
thereto) the practice has been fully carried out. The number of pupils in these 
schools ranges from 40 or 50 up to 250. In general the male sex furnishes the majority 
of pupils, but little by little this excess is diminishing. In the largest school known 
to me, i. €., Sandefjord’s middle school, T found an almost equal distribution ; in one— 
class the boys predominated, put in another the girls. In a few of these schools, | 
originally a kind of lower burgher schools, co-education was introduced at their first 
establishment, about twenty years ago; but in most of them co-education has been 
actually practiced only five or six years. ; 
Co-education in middle schools received the approbation of the authorities first: 
4 after a preliminary debate in the Storthing (legislative body) in the spring of 1484, 
which was occasioned by a request from the commercial city Brevik, ior a public 
contribution to a communal middle school for boys and girls. ‘That 'roke the ice. 
+ A few years later a departmental circular opened also the gymnasia for female pupils, 
3 ‘and the example of Brevik found many followers. Under the financial pressure of 
the decade 1870-80 numerous middle schools were established, both in cities and in 
the country, which in the following straitened years weighed hard upon the com- 
-munal budgets. For several of these schools co-education with its great economical

advantages offered the only security from financial ruin. That the higher school 
education has become so deeply rooted in as it is among our population is essentially 
due to co-education. ; 
Weshould also notice how coeducation, step by step, has gained its way. This 
system was first cautiously introduced in ‘the small lower classes; to these in time 
were added the lowest middle classes; and after an interval the girls, on account of 
their standing, received admittance to the graduating classes, and finally people 
came to the conclusion that coeducation would be the most practical and satisfac- 
tory system. Only in a few communities, which for a longer period have had well- 
equipped girls’ schools, the matter is so arranged that these schools transfer the girls 
who want to take the higher courses to the highest boys’ schools or to the next high- 
est classes. While in this manner some schools stopped half way, on the other hand 
no retrograde steps have been taken. Coeducation, where it has once found en- 
trance, has steadily gained ground. Iam in possession of statements, the speaker 
continued, from the leading men of our mixed schools, and I will take advantage 
of this opportunity to give hearty thanks for the full, clear, and suggestive answers 
sentto me. The statements therein also refer to public feeling both against and for 
the system. It is repeatedly mentioned that coeducation has met with doubt and 
opposition, But at present it appears to me that dissatisfaction has subsided; no- 
where do people wish a change; on the contrary, lively expressions of satisfaction 
frequently occur. 
It is easily understood and is emphatically expressed in many of the statements 
that economical interests carry special weight in the eyes of the treasurers in favor 
of coeducation. Apart from a few theorists it was doubtless everywhere at first 
on account of economy that a general sentiment was aroused in favor of mixed 
schools, Parents preferred to have their children instructed together, instead of hay- 
ing only one part, the boys, taught, or of having them instructed separately at two- 
fold expense. Some add that they prefer this system instead of having their chil- 
dren inefficiently instructed. The mixed school renders it possible to make a more 
complete grading. A generation ago it was thought natural in all public schools of 
our cities that the boys and girls should be separated as soon as the number of the 
pupils was large enough to support two schools. 
A reaction has been brought about in many places, and more weight is attached to 
classifying the pupils according to ability and age than to sex. In this manner several 
of our schools have been reunited, and I have only heard of favorable results. 
The questions I have presented to my Norwegian colleagues can be condensed as 
follows: 
1. How do the mixed schools affect the health of the girls? 
2. How does coeducation accord with the programmes and methods of study? 
3. What influence has it upon morality in school ? 
Or, in other words, what is thought of coeducation judged from the standpoint of 
the school’s triple duty as a physical, intellectual, and ethical training school. 
I.—EFFECT OF MIXED SCHOOLS UPON THE HEALTH OF THE GIRLS. 
Thanks to the investigations of Prof. Axel Key and of the Danish commission 
on hygiene, relative to the sanitary conditions of the school population, which have. 
attracted attention even outside of the Scandinavian countries, we are better ac- 
quainted with the sanitary condition of Swedish and Danish schools than of those of 
any other country. As to Norway, we have no data to present, but it is supposed 
that the conditions are analogous to those in the neighboring countries. From the 
reports of the Swedish and Danish investigations mentioned it is evident that the 
sanitary state of the school population is not good, is worse in the schools for girls 
than in the schoois for boys; and worst in the higher schools for girls in Sweden. 
The percentage of ill health, which in the total number of boys’ schools in Denmark 
amounts to 29 per cent., rises in the Latin schools to 32; in teachers’ seminaries in 
Sweden to 39; and finally, in the thirty-five higher girls’ schools which were investi- 
gated, the enormous proportion of 61 per cent. is found (shortsightedness net in- 
cluded). Both the Danish school committees assert that the percentages of ill health 
stated represent the minimum number. If we schoolmen now refer to expert physi- 
cians in order to find out how far the school is at fault with regard to this precarious 
condition, we shall be left in the dark. They mention a number of hygienic disad- 
vantages, as insufficient light and air, inadequate heating apparatus, school material, 
ete.; too long schoo] hours with too short recesses ; objectionable distribution of lessons 
with too many studies at home; insufficient hygienic control by the school author- 
ities; the teachers’ lack of hygienic physiological education, ete. But, although 
these evils are bad enough and should impress all who are connected with schools, 
the physicians seem to agree that “the factors of sickliness are* generally of a most 
complicated nature, so that it is impossible to isolate them from each other, and that 
every attempt to prove that the children’s sickliness depends, e. g., on the longer or

) ie 
shorter school hours, must be condemned.” (Statement ofthe Swedish school commit- 
tee for girls.) i a 
The Alsace-Lorraine hygienic commission in its report of 1883 attributed the sad 
sanitary condition of young people principally to the existing social conditions; the 
sedentary life and impracticable dresses of girls; the influence of exciting literature 
upon the nervous system, public dancing, light theatrical plays, etc. And the Swed- 
jsh school committee further specifies hereditary tendencies, abuse of alcohol, etc. 
Professor Key says, ‘ Schools are as we want them to be;” and he explains with 
regard to girls, “Tt is the extra housework which produces overexertion, there 
where tho burden is already heavy.” The Swedish girls’ school committee sympa- 
thizes in this with Professor Key. The following temarks are worthy of notice: 
“According to the Danish school commission, in the Danish schools for girls the 
daily study hours are longer than with us (in Sweden), the vacations are much 
shorter, gymimastics are on a low level, and there are no regular lunch hours; the 
school grounds are usually not as well located as in our country—a natural conse- 
quence of the lower school fees in Denmark. But in spite of these unfavorable con- 
ditions, the sanitation in the Danish schools for girls is 22 per cent. better than in i 
the Swedish.” 
Thus, although we know very little of the actual effect the schools in general have — 
upon the health of the children, one thing is certain, the health of school girls ison an 
average worse than that ofboys. Itis evident that girls’ schools have had Jess atten- 
tion paid to their hygienie arrangements than those for boys, and they are even in 
our day treated as of secondary consequence by the state. Physical training has — 
only slowly gained its way. | Grown-up persons, the educated--one-sided educated— 
and learned people have measured the child with their own measure and have made 
the erudition of the mind, swhich in many respects would have been a natural object 
of their own wishes, the only aim of early school education. "The education of boys 
jn and outside of the school is fortunately improving. The boys take the lead and 
the girls follow at a distance. 
| Many expressions of fresh child life, which for centuries were permitted to boys, — 
have not been considered decorous for girls. Arecently published work by Pinloche, 
a French writer, relating to Basedow and philanthropy, furnishes a retrospective 
view of the school affairs of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries which is any- 
thing but inspiring. Only think, in a regulation of a gymnasium in Eisenach, 1676, 
we read: The boys are forbidden to pathe and wash in cold water ‘‘ because itisa 
very dangerous thing to do.” They shall refrain from skating on the ice, from snow- 
palling, from ball games. Paragraphs upon paragraphs follow, beginning with the 
significant words of that time, “astineant,” “ fugiant,” ete. These paragraphs have 
long since been struck out of the school regulations for boys, but they were retained 
for girls.in Scandinavia until late in our century; and as antediluvian as if may 
appear to many, nevertheless it is certain that education in school and honse still 
utters in many instances to the weaker sex Hamlet’s words to Ophelia: “ Frailty, 
thy name is woman.” 
i woman is frail by nature and education, we | 
push from us the favorable means by which to improve her health by offering her 
when a child the opportunity to play with the boys, to take walks with them, to 
engage in skating and sleighing parties, wood and field excursions. A frail boy will 
always improve in company with stronger boys and under proper care. Why should 
this not be the case with the sex that has been named the “ weaker?” Bat a true 
fellowship between children, which in our days consists chiefly in their school inter- 
ests, requires school companionship, school partnership, coedacation. 
But we meet with the objection that what we gain in one respect through coedu- 
cation, we lose in another. The feebler strength of girls will not permit them with- _ 
out overexertion to bear the same amount of work as‘the boys; the girl’s brain will 
not be able to assimilate the same amount of learning as that of the boy, or if so, it 
will be atthe expense of her phy al development, which with respect to women 
requires many peculiar conside. ons. , 
In this way many people find an obstacle to coeducation. Unfortunately, we 
schoolmen are not, as We should be, physiologists, and professional physiologists are 
not asa rule pedagogues; and, as scientists so often' disagree, it is hard fora layman 
to form a proper judgment. ‘Tho intormation I received from several learned an 
experienced physicians can ‘yo condensed as follows: Up to twelve years of age all 
agree that the mixed school can not endanger the health of the girls; after twelve 
years many physicians express themselves doubtful, but think it justifiable to pro- 
ceed tentatively, keeping the ears open to the voice of experience in whatever di- 
rection its ufterances may tend. Some physicians declare decidedly that from the 
physical standpoint no objection can be raised against the same studies for girls as 
those laid down for boys, provided that the girls are brought under the same favor- 
able hygienic conditions as the boys. “Tf you can provide the girls with the same 
physical exercises as the boys, there will be no danger,” I heard one physician say. 
     are so much the less entitled to 
   
-P-A-G-E-539
  COEDUCATION OF THE SEXES. 467 
Another physician said, ‘‘ Do away with the corset and that will more than counterbal- 
ance the difference in lessons.” With regard to the Norwegian mixed schools, the 
school committees have tried to forestall every danger and have made arrangements 
by which the work in mathematics is somewhat reduced for girls, the division of 
middle-school examinations is transferred to an earlier school grade, and finally the 
course for girls in the highest class of the middle schools may last two years. These 
measures permit ‘‘at the critical age” both a shortening of daily school hours and a 
decrease of the general home studies, leaving some spare time for household work. 
The arrangement has of course disadvantages; a two years’ course in which a'class 
of girls is associated in turn with two different classes of boys is not a perfect sys- 
tem of coeducation. ' 
But let us look around in other parts of the world. In several States of the United 
States coeducation has for generations been practiced, though not without opposi- 
tion. The physical capacity of the female sex has especially been a burning question. 
It is well known that American physicians in medical journals have ascribed a poor 
standing to American women of the better classes, as wives and mothers. One 
especially, the late Dr. Clarke, of Boston, in a manner that attracted attention on 
this side of the ocean, attributed this evil to coeducation, and prophesied as a con- 
sequence thereof a general degeneration of the female sex. I followed the movement 
as far as was in my power at such a distance, and in the year 18841 furnished in 
Vor Ungdom an account of some contemporary documents, especially of. a complete 
officialreport of the spread of coeducation in the United States with the prevailing 
opinion on that subject. ‘The report was prepared by the Commissioner of Education 
in Washington, Hon. John Eaton, partly on account of repeated requests for informa- 
tion from Europe. Mr. Eaton’s investigation comprised more than three hundred 
large and small cities of the Union, aid furnished on the whole remarkable testimony 
in fayor of mixed schools, The following sentence expressed the general sentiment 
of the time: ‘“We are created male and female; all the impulses and activities of 
nature enforce coeducation ; if we must live together we must be educated to that end; 
to educate separately is an attempt to change the natural order of human economy.” , 
This information from America contributed to a certain degree to the advancement 
of coeducation in Europe. From the same report, however, it appears that the sys- 
tem met with considerable opposition in the West, an opposition which in the eyes 
of some people received a certain official stamp two years later (i. e., 1885), by a pub- 
lication of the Bureau of Education. This publication was a circular by Mr. Phil- 
brick, who for one generation had a great influence upon education in Boston. Mr. 
Philbrick’s writing is an earnest and distinguished work, the testimony of an experi- 
enced schoolman, who regarded the school system of his country more critically than 
Americans usually do; it treats more of other subjects, however, and speaks of coedu- 
cation only occasionally and somewhat critically, as if it were less appreciated in 
America than formerly. ‘‘Coeducation makes it harder”—this is in short his con- 
clusion—‘ to remedy the reigning overpressure in the schools and it prevents ‘spe- 
cialization’ of schools.” Mr. Philbrick is no partisan of the movement. which at 
present is called ‘‘ mixed schools.” Commissioner Eaton introduces Mr. Philbrick’s 
circular with many complimentary words, but at the same time he takes care to make 
it plain that the Bureau by publishing this work does not indorse all the opinions 
expressed therein. As nevertheless the people in Norway and of late the Swedish 
girls’ school committee have construed Mr. Philbrick’s writing as an official retreat 
from the standpoint regarding coeducation which the Bureau of Education com- 
mended in its publication of 1883, I consider it opportune to-day, with reference to 
the conception of Mr. Philbrick’s writing as it has been understood in the Scandi- 
navian countries, to take as a guide in our discussion the recent authentic statement 
from the Bureau itself. The explicit answer of June 17, this year, from the Bureau, 
has been prepared by the present Commissioner, Dr. W. T. Harris. ' It states his 
thorough personal experience of both systems, i. e., the mixed school and the separate 
school; he enters upon the essential features of the question and sets forth, forcibly and 
decisively, in the lighs of experience, the acknowledged advantages of coeducation. 
This important document will be published in Vor Ungdom (Our Young People). 
At present I confine myself to the following extract: 
“TY think the overwhelming majority of all persons engaged in education in the 
United States are in favor of coeducation. With regard to Mr. Philbrick’s judgment 
on the subject. of coeducation, I think that he stood almost alone among our ablest’ 
writers on education in his opinion, The Boston schools under his charge educated 
the sexes separately. It may be that his experience in that city had undue influence 
on his opinion. At present, with the extension of the city limits, so that new suburbs 
have been taken in, there are now in Boston very many primary and grammar schools 
(pupils from 10 to 14 yeurs of age) and also secondary schools (so-called high schools) 
now in Boston which have coeducation. ‘The prophecies of Dr, Clarke, of Boston, to 
the effect that coeducation would prove injurious to the health of women, have not 
been fulfilled, Avery active society of graduates from universities educating women

468 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888- f 
.* * * the Association of Collegiate Alumnex, have collected the statistics on 
this point proving that the health of women engaged in higher education is as good 
as that of men.” ‘ PR i 
The Finlander, Rev. K. T, Broberg, as is well known, walks in the same path, as may be seen from his Jakttagelser under en pedagogisk resa i Nord Amerika (Observations — 
During a Pedagogical Journey in North America), Helsingfors, 1849. These observa- 
tions also impress us with ie idea that coeducation has found steady appreciation 
and application in those sections of America where people formerly were opposed to it. Other statements which I have received confirm this view. Among others, a — 
Norwegian lady, Miss Bentzen, who, aided by a public grant, is studying the Ameri- 
can school system, especially the mixed schools, states that coeducation has every- 
where in America found a foothold. If this is the case, the Americans must be con- 
vineed that ¢oeducation does not threaten physical degeneration in the female sex, 
and it appears probable that the mixed school can be arranged in a manner to meet 
the demands of the time as well as the separate school. It is a very different ques- 
tion whether or not schools, as they at present are established in Europe, in Denmark, 
Sweden, Finland, and Norway, could satisfy these demands. i 
II.—CouRsES OF STUDY IN MIXED SCHOOLS. 
' i 
In the second division of his address, Dr. Voss dwells upon the ideas formerly pre- 
vailing in Germany with regard to the weaker sex, and their inadequate school edu- 
cation. He cites Fichte’s gallant remark: ‘‘ Man has to make himself rational, while | 
woman by nature is rational.” This, observes Mr. Voss, is beautifully said, but prob- 
ably all women will resent such gallantry if the price, spiritually speaking, is to live © 
a life upon half rations. He refers to his observations made in home and foreign 
schools for both sexes. ; 
Teachers of mixed schools in Norway allagree that girls are fully able to follow the 
same courses as boys. A ten years’ experience at universities in England, America, 
the Scandinavian countries, and elsewhere confirms the fact that women can pursue 
all branches of our higher intellectual culture. He referred to Miss Helene Lange's 
work, Die Frauenbildung (Berlin), and to Strack’s article ‘“ Geschlechtertrennung” in 
Schmid’s Encyclopedia. As to the German school system, so often held forth as an 
example and which keeps the timid from entering on the path of reform, much good | 
can be said of it. Steadfastly, without change in the system, and with full and har- 
monious development, the German school has worked itself up to its present high 
standing, from the tinie of the reformers. At all times it presents a very fine scien- 
tific aim, and often a noble conception of the school’s high vocation. No other coun- 
try has developed such an admirable technique in instruction, In each individual — 
domain all other countries have learnt from the German pedagogues. But the 
school’s remarkable specialization is dearly purchased by its isolation, ete. 
IIL.—INFLUENCE OF COEDUCATION UPON MORALITY. 
The speaker then returus to the question, ‘‘ What influence has coeducation upon 
morality?” The Swedish girls’ school committee proposed to make a trial of mixed — 
schools for children up to fifteen years of age, in thirty-five smaller cities, where girls 
otherwise hardly would have a chance of receiving higher education. This plan was. opposed in Stockholm in 1889 by a predominant majority of the Domkapitler (consistory 
or council of clergy), as it appears, from fear of the moral influence of mixed schools. 
In opposition to the Domkapitler’s authority, Mr. Voss cites an extract from Schmid’s Encyclopedia, written by G. Bauer, who recommends coedueation, f 
Mr. Voss observes that small nations have sometimes their advantages. In the 
Prussian public schools there are on an average 77 pupils in a class, sometimes even 
100; in the higher classes, from 50 to 60 children. “In the Scandinavian countries 
the maximum is 30, which number seldom is reached. All scruples, therefore, as to too crowded classes in our Scandinavian schools do not exist and can not form an 
argument against coeducation. f 
From the Prussian Rhine province, where public schools are divided into seyen 
grades, Mr. Voss continues, I have received private informations through the school superintendent and district school inspector, stating that experience proves the ben- eficial influence of coeducation on morality in schools. The obstacles to coeduca- tion in Germany are (1) the study of Latin for children of 9 years of age, “ from 
which absurdity,” adds the writer, ‘‘ may God protect our little girls ;” and (2) that women are not authorized to teach in the higher grades of schools for girls. The answers to inquiries made in Norway as to morality in mixed schools have likewise been very satisfactory. A tendency to flirtation has been noticed, but in a 
very innocent manner, and it disappears in proportion as coeducation is completely 
introduced, Sometimes it is said the girls keep to themselves and don’t wish to have

anything to do with the ‘disagreeable boys,” but as a rule the relation between 
boys and the girls develops naturally as between brothers and sisters. 
Similar conditions are noticeable in America, according to M. Buisson, Paul Janet,

Coeducation is introduced at Helsingfors, in Finland, a city with 60,000 inhab- 
itants. Professor Gustafson, of Helsingfors, emphasizes the beneficial influence of 
coeducation upon boys and girls, the boys become less selfish, the girls more truth- 
ful and natural. - 
With regard to discipline great satisfaction is éxpressed in Finland, that the 
teachers’ corps includes both men and women. A good woman teacher is fully able 
to manage boys. 
‘The attention and zeal of children are increasing through coeducation. There is 
less strain upon girls in the mixed schools than in separate schools and they become 
used to a rational system of studying. 
IV.—CoEDUCATION IN HIGHER INSTITUTIONS. 
Hitherto in his address Mr. Voss has confined himself to the elementary schools. 
With respect to schools for advanced students, gymnasia, etc., he says briefly ; If the 
pedagogical views which I have expressed contain truths, their application will also 
be practicable for the higher grades. The chief question is: Do we gentlemen desire 
to oppose obstacles to women who are anxious to study? Or do we entertain the 
narrow idea that a little scientific knowledge can make bad wives and mothers of 
our daughters? Is it not the desire for scientific truth which, without stopping at 
difficulties and hindrances, but with impetuous impulse constantly acquires new pro- 
vinces for haman knowledge, in unity with the general feelings of mankind, with the 
spirit of solidarity, which has use for all energies and will make all partakers in the 
work, troubles, and reward of the struggle? And should one-half of mankind be left 
outside or only be admitted by a back door? Who does not feel the impossibility of 
maintaining such a view? Let us with faith in the emancipating power of truth 
throw open the chief gateway to all who knock. : 
Practically we have here in the North already solved this question by admitting 
women to the university studies. This we do not repent. It is certainly foolish to 
deny her admittance to the school course which prepares for these studies. In Nor- 
way the fact has been acknowledged that the competent female pupils who 
entered this road—though they were small in number—have been a pride to the 
gymuasia, 
There is a country called France, more notorious for its radicalism than any other _ 
country. How and where has it educated its daughters? Hidden in cloisters as in 
no other civilized country. At present the French people are trying to rid them- 
selves of this system, and a sigh of grief goes through the discussions over the 
separating wall which the former educational system has raised between the beliefs, 
ideas, and habits of the two sexes. Jhe principal idea can be expressed in brief: 
The unity of the family requires identity of education for men and women. L’unité 
de la famille and Videntité de Véducation are bywords. Oras Gambetta expresses him- 
self: In order to make hearts beat together souls must be brought together. It 
applied perhaps to more countries than France, when a politician who is anything 
but radical, Count de Mun, recently called out in the Chamber of Deputies: ‘It is 
the dissolution of the family which is the misfortune of our age,” or when Jules 
Simon (in Arbeidersken) complains: ‘ Communities have established schools for the 
children, asylums for the old, but they have forgotten one thing: the hearth for the 
family. They have considered all the necessities of the body, but the heart they 
have forgotten.” Perhaps the schoo], the much diyided primary school, has_tres- 
passed against ‘the hearth of the home.” When we look around in our family cir- 
cle, we hardly can keep off the thought that every time we divide the primary 
school, we cut out a piece from the life and conscience of the nation. We find an 
expression for the innermost thought of coeducation in the words with which Ernest 
Legouvé, eighty years of age, concludes a book which he furnishes with the pretty 
title The History of my House: ‘All my ambition, all my longings have been to 
establish within these walls a part of that which has engraved itself deepest into 
my heart. I mean the feeling which constitute’ the principal interest of my life, 
which has sustained me in all my troubles, spurred me in all my works, consoled me 
in all my afflictions, upheld me in all my despondency, and which has increased my 
pleasures: love for my family.”

   CHAPTER XVII. 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE LAWS IN THE UNITED 
STATES. 
WITH AN APPENDIX UPON COMPULSORY EDUCATION LEGISLATION IN PRUSSIA. 
  
Twenty-seven States and Territories of the Union have at the present time" compul- 
sory attendance laws in operation. These vary considerably in their character and in 
the degree to which they attain the end for which they were enacted. 
In the following pages the text of several of these laws is given, together with au- 
_ thoritative statements of any facts relating to the operation of the same, and if inoper- 
ative the reasons therefor—whether any known defect in the Jaw itself, or the lack of 
public sentiment demanding its strict enforcement, or both combined, as is more likely 
to be the case. A brief historical résumé is also given for several States, in which the 
course of compulsory legislation in the past has been traced; this is notably the case 
with Massachusetts, which was the pioneer State in this matter, and in which a deter- 
mination to make the law effective has resulted in frequent amendment, The defects 
ér deficiencies of the law in its earlier forms are pointed out, as well as the various 
steps which were taken to bring it to its present state‘of efficiency. The record of the 
experience of Massachusetts is a most valuable, one for the guidance of those who are 
engaged in inaugurating or perfecting measures of an analogous character, 
In the two States, viz, Massachusetts and Connecticut, in which the laws have been 
the most effective (though not the most elaborate or intricate), a tendency may be no- 
ticed toward two distinct types or systems: In Massachusetts, though the law is in its 
terms obligatory upon all towns, the system is practically a local-option one, and is ad- 
ministered by the towns. In Connecticut, on the other hand, a more centralized sys- 
tem has been developed, in which the State executes the law through its own agents, 
with the codperation of the local authorities. It would seem that the latter method is 
the more generally effective. \ 
In addition to the States and. Territories included in the following list, Maryland, 
Texas, and Arizona have had compulsory-attendance laws on their statute books, but 
have repealed them or suffered them to lapse. In nearly every other State the subject 
has been discussed, and in some, notably Pennsylvania, Indiana’, and Iowa, bills have 
been introduced which have failed for the time being to become laws. 
The principle of compulsory education issteadily gainingground. Steps in advance 
are being taken here and there all along the line, Since 1886 no less than sixteen 
States and Territories have either enacted laws for the first time or ‘have made their 
former laws more stringent. The arguments and discussions of thirty years or more 
havebeen gradually silencing opposition, and public sentiment is slowly crystallizing 
in the direction of requiring by law all parents to provide a certain minimum of school 
instruction for their children. This tendency is unmistakable. 
The following table shows the dates at which the several States and Territories first 
1M pis chapter has been revised as far as practicable to March, 1891. 
24 compulsory attendance bill has again failed (1891) to pass the Indiana legislature, haying had 
a large majority against it. }

An attempt was made in this connection to compile statistics showing the effect of 
compulsory laws upon school attendance, but without success. The proportion of chil- 
dren affected by a compulsory-attendance law is so small, and the other influences tend- 
ing to increase or decrease school attendance are so varied and far-reaching that the 
effect of compulsory laws may be and generally is completely masked. It is shown 
elsewhere in this Report (Chap, I) that the percentage of public school attendance in the 
North has been continuously decreasing during the period compulsory legislation has 
been taking shape, the effect of such laws having been completely neutralized by the 
continuous action of other agencies. Mr. Giles Potter, agent of the Connecticut State 
Board, says upon this subject: 
‘* When we look for results of compulsory school laws in the statisties of the State, it 
should be remembered that the entire percentage of the number of children affected by 
such laws is not large. The great majority of children who attend school are sent with- 
out any thought of law. They would go just as regularly if no such laws had ever been 
enacted. If this were not so these lawscould not be enforcedinany case. Inany given 
, year a larger percentage of children may be kept from school by a contagious disease or 
an inclement season than the entire percentage affected by the law, and hence its influ- 
ence, so far as shown by statistics, be wholly lost sight of.”? 1 
MASSACHUSETTS. 
The subject of universal education engaged the attention of the general court of Mas- 
_ sachusetts from the time of its earliest settlement. As far back as 1642 the selectmen 
of every town were required to ‘‘have a vigilant eye over their brethren and neighbors, 
to see that none of them shall suffer so much barbarism in any of their families as not to endeavor to teach, by themselves and others, their children and apprentices so much 
Jearning as may enable them perfectly to read the English tongue, and a knowledge of 
the capital laws,’’ upon penalty of 20 shillings for each neglect therein. 
Later it was made the duty of resident ministers of the gospel, the selectmen, and the 
school committees to exert their best endeavors that the youth of their towns should 
regularly attend the schools established for their instruction. 
For nearly 200 years, however, the Massachusetts ‘‘system of free schools was sus- 
tained directly by the people, without special care or direct aid from the government. 
The people were then homogeneous; the sentiment in favor of free schools was univer- 
sal; deficiencies in the schools, when they existed, were often supplied .by instruction 
in the family; and if there was little completeness of system or perfection of detail, yet the results were worthy of all praise.’””? 
But with the coming in of a foreign and a manufacturing population, the concentra- 
tion of wealth, and the more marked division of the people into sects and classes, it was 
found that the public schools were losing their efficiency and the system itself its vital- ity. This alarmed patriotic and intelligent men, and gave rise in 1834 to the provision 
for a school fund, and.to the establishment in 1837 of the

  | STATE BOARD or ED CATION. | i ey A new era then opened. The State board and its secretaries gave their attention to perfecting the public-school system, improving schools sa hool buildings, and espe- cially to raising the standard of the teaching force. Asa visions for increasing school attendance were devised, which truant law of 1850, to the compulsory-attendance act of 1852.1 This law (of 1852) was the first of a series of enactments Basie legislatures prescrib- ing compulsory attendance, and furnished a model on which the earlier laws of other States were based; it was a practical embodiment of the principle that it is the right and duty of the State, for its own safety and advantage, to intervene and compel the parent to accord to his child, as a fundamental right, so much of education as shall fit him to be a citizen of a free state. As this law is an important landmark in American educational history, it is here reproduced verbatim, including amendments to 1859. t of this movement, pro- 
ally led up, through the 
THE FIRST MASSACHUSETTS LAW. 
i Suction 1. Every person having under his control a child between the ages of eight and fourteen years shall annually during the continuance of his control send such child to some public select in the city or town in which he resides at loast twelve weelks, if the public schocle of souk city or see Go, dome continue, six weeks of which time shall be consecutive; and for every newlect of euch duty the party offending shall forfeit to the use of such eity or town a sum nod exeseding twenty dollars ; but if it appears upon the inquiry of the truant officersor school committee ot any city or town, or upon the trial of any prosecution, that the party so neglecting was notable, by That oman Beverty, to send such child fo school, or fo furnish him with the means of education, thatsuch child has been otherwise furnished with the means of education for alike portato time, Or has already acquired the branches of learning taught in the public schools, or that his bodily Pir rental condition has been such as to prevent his attendance at school or application to study for the period required, the penalty before mentioned shall not be ineurred, Suc. 2, ‘The truant officers and the school committees of the severalcities and towns shall inquire into all cases of neglect of the duty prescribed in the preceding section, and ascertain frueine Poth daeneslecting the reasons, ifany, therefor; and shall forthwith give notice of all violations, rej the Teasons, to the treasurer of the city or town; and if such treasurer willtully neglects ct Jernses to prosecute any person liable to the penalty provided for in the preceding section he erat forfeit the sum of twenty dollars.? 
This law of 1852 apparently attracted little attention. In fact, it is not mentioned at all, or is barely referred to, in the State reports until 1860. On the contrary, the Rey. Barnas Sears says in 1855, while enumerating the various expedients resorted to to diminish irregularity of attendance: ‘In many towns rules have been established by the school committee excluding from the school those whose absences exceed a certain amount,’’* a meastre looking rather to compulsory absence than to compulsory attend- ance. Supt. Geo. S. Boutwell published the law in full in the twenty-fourth report (1859-60), but without any information as to what extent it was enforced. How little advance the idea of enforced attendance had made at that period may be gathered from the following remarks of Rev. B. G. Northrop, agent of the board, in 1861: ‘‘In those cases where parents, without good reason, deprive their children of the advantages of education, some coercion like that tae ed in the general stat- utes may properly he employed, although compulsion should be used with caution and only as a last resortin those comparatively rare cases where all other means have tailed. *. % * The existence of such a law, when sanctioned and sustained by a public sen- timent alive to the importance of the subject, will add weight and authority to personal persuasions, ’? + ‘ 1 a ‘ Early truant laws.—The evils of truancy had previously been the subject of many val- uable discussions on the part of Mr. Mann and his successors, who had urged all possi- ble efforts forits suppression, In Tesponse thereto laws were passed in 1850 and several years following which were finally consolidated (about 1859) into a general statute. This statute gave to cities and towns authority to make all needful provisions ‘ con- cerning habitual truants® and children ot attending school, or without any regular and lawful occupation, or growing up in ignorance, between the ages of five and sixteen years.”’ . Towns availing themselves of this permission were required to appoint truant officers, whoalone should make complaints and earry into execution judgments; truants convicted under it might be fined, or sent to an institution of instruction or reforma- tion, or provided with a situation for work.® ie 
‘An act had previously passed, in 1842, in addition to an act of 1836, providing that no child should be employed in any manufacturing establishment more than ten’ hours a day, if said child be under twelve years of age. {Copied from 24 Mass.

Rep. (1859-60), p. 136, ,

    COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE—MASSACHUSETTS., AT3. 
The legislature of 1862 passed anew truant act, changing the law in two important par- 
ticulars: First, the two classesof offenses, truancy and absenteeism, were more clearly dis- 
tinguished and defined than before; and second, that which was only permissible and op- 
tional in the former act was made an absolute requirement in the latter. In effect, what 
was formerly a law giving permission to towns to ‘‘make provisions’? now became 
a pronounced and mandatory truant law. ‘‘Each city and town,’’ the new act reads, 
‘shall’ make all needful provisions and arrangements concerning habitual truants and 
also concerning children wandering about in the streets or public places of any city 
or town, having no lawful occupation or business, not attending school, and growing up 
in ignorance, between the ages of seven and sixteen years.’’ The remaining provisions 
of the previous law were left substantially unchanged.' 
The justices of the police court of Boston found this act defective, inasmuch as it did 
not expressly determine who should have jurisdiction under it. ‘Tq remedy this, an 
additional act was passed in 1863 providing that either of the justices of the police court 
of the city of Boston, and any judge or justice of any police court, and any trial justice 
in the State, shall have jurisdiction within their respective counties.” 
An obstacle in the way of the tiuant law.—The most serious difficulty in the way of a 
successful execution of the truant law was found to be in the disposition to be made of 
the offenders. ‘‘It is obvious,’’ says Supt. White, ‘‘that children should be confined 
where they can enjoy the privileges which they are punished for neglecting, and where 
they shall be removed from all contact with the vicicus. Unless this can be secured 
the law will fail of its highest usefulness, and prove an injury rather than a blessing.”’ 
It was recommended that there should be a distinct establishment for the purpose in 
which manual and mental ‘‘labor’’ should be combined. Most of the cities and large 
towns, in fact, had within a reasonable distance institutions where arrangements could 
be made to thatend. Where such places did noi exist, it was suggested that the towns 
should associate together, or else the counties, for the purpose of establishing them. 
Further defects of the truant law.—The Boston school committee complain the follow- 
ing year (1864) that the powers of the school board in the matter of truancy have been 
unwisely restricted, and assert that the truant officers‘are a part of school, not of crim- 
inal machinery, and should therefore be entirely under the control of the school board. 
““They owe to the school board no accountability, receive trom it none of. their power, 
and are under no obligations to inform it what may be done or what may be left un- 
done.’”? 
In 1866, four years after the passage of the revised truant act, only 98 cities and towns 
out of a total of 335 had chosen truant officers in obedience to law. In these cities and 
towns the law was enforced to a greater or less extent. But as there was no penalty an- 
nexed to the failure to appoint truant officers the requirement was ‘‘largely ignored.”” 
The compulsory attendance law almost a dead letter—Reasons for its failure. —Coming back 
to the compulsory-attendance law proper (of 1852) it may be said that it was completely 
ignored for about two decades in the reports of the State board and its secretaries, ex- 
cept as quoted above. Apparently, public opinion was not yet ripe for such a measure 
and no attempt was made to enforce it. For instance, in 1869 the truant commissioner 
_of Lowell reported that out of 717 cases of truancy investigated there were found 447 
cases of absence with permission of parents. ‘‘I have labored hard,’’ said the commis- 
sioner, ‘‘to impress on the minds of thisclass of parents the vital necessity of constant 
attendance of their children while members of our schools.’’? But it does not appear 
that he or anyone else hadresortin any case to sterner measures when ‘‘all other means’? 
had failed. General Oliver, the State constable, says, a short time after, regarding the 
enforcement of the compulsory law, ‘‘nobody looks after it,’’ ‘‘ nobody thinks of obey- 
ing the school laws,’ and ‘‘ most people are ignorant that there is any such law.’’ 
Superintendent White took up the subject in 1870, after so long a silence, and pro- 
ceeded to state the reasons of failure and inaugurate a new departure: ‘‘I am fully con- 
.vinceed, he says, ‘‘after many years of observation and inquiry, that the seyeral enact- 
ments relating to this matter [absenteeism] are ill adapted to their purpose, discordant, 
and incapable of execution, and therefore need, a careful and thorough revision, to which 
ample time and thought should be given. I therefore respectfully recommend that the 
present legislature be requested to pass a resolve directing the board of education or 
such other competent body as may be deemed proper to take into consideration ali

existing laws relating to school attendance, eae absenteeism, and the employment 
of children in manufacturing establishments,' and inquire whe + alterations and amend- 
ments are needed to combine said enactments into a uniform, consistent, and efficient 
code adapted to the present views and wants of the publie.”? 
Compulsory attendance act of 1873.—This recommendation was renewed by the State 
poardin 1872. The outcome of the efforts made in this direction was the act of 1873, 
This act cut short the period of enforced attendance two years, changing it from 8-14 
to 8-12; but the annual period of such attendance was exten: ed from 12 to 20 weeks.’ 
The most decided improvement, however, was in the mode of enforcement; by the act 
of 1952 town treasurers were subjected to a penalty of $20 for willful neglect or refusal 
to prosecute under it, *‘a most ingeniously contrived method of how not to do it; ‘tof 
course this functionary would not find time for so disagreeable service; of course his re- 
fusal or neglect would not be willful, even ina legal sense, and thus the matter would 
end.”’? The new law required that prosecution for infractions of it should be made by 
the truant officers, ‘‘when so directed by the ‘school committee.”? The responsibility 
was no longer divided between two parties—one to make inquiry and report, and an- 
other to prosecute, but rested solely with the school committee, where it properly be- 
longed. ) | : 
It was provided that no objection should be made by the school committee to attend- 
ance on any private school on account of the religious teaching in it.* 
Effect of the old law. —"' The law [of 1852] was an honor to the Commonwealth, as far- 
nishing a high standard and rule of duty; and although but partially enforced, it bas, 
nevertheless, in its practical working, been thesource of incalculable good to the Com- 
monwealth.’’ (Superintendent White. ) t 
Improvements in the truant law.—The same year (1873), and as a part of the same 
movement, the truant laws were reconstructed and consolidated. Towns and cities 
were now required to provide suitable places for the ‘‘confinement, discipline, and in- 
struction”? of truant children. The provision, “alike impracticable and absurd, for 
attempting to punish the truant child by a fine,” was omitted, and only his confine- 
ment in a place of instruction provided for. ‘The law is not a penal one, but reforma- 
tory rather, The truant or absentee is not a criminal, and should not be treated as 
one. * * *. His confinement for the purposes of control and instruction should not 
pe with the criminal classes.”’ { ; 
‘Another marked improvement was the transferring from the several cities and towns 
themselves to the school committees thereof the duty of appointing and fixing the com- 
pensation of truant officers; and second, in making those officers the agents of said 
committees, in enforcing the provisions of the act, and of the by-laws adoptéd under it. 
“The duties and responsibilities of the town and of the school committee, under this 
law, are separate and distinct—of the former, to adopt the necessary by-laws, to pro- 
Vide a place for the confinement and instruction of the persons convicted under them; 
of the latter, to appoint proper persons as truant officers, and to superintend and direct — 
~ them in the discharge of their duties.”’ 
County commissioners were required, at the instance of three or more cities or towns 
in any county, to establish at convenient places truant schools, other than the jail or 
house of correction.* { 
The truant officers had now become a part of the school system, and were appointed t 
by theschool committees; yet, the school committees did not proceed to obey the provi- 
~ gions of the truant, law with much more alacrity than the town authorities had done; 
there was still lacking any penalty for failure to take action, In 1875, out of 341 
towns in the State, truant officers had been appointed in 30 only.’ In these the truant 
Jaw was tolerably well enforced, as a general rule, and the evils of absenteeism greatly 
diminished. Cambridge, after tryinga truant officer, ‘‘thought that/for various reasons 
it would be better to haye this officer more immediately connected with the police de- 
partment, and four day policemen were appointed to actas truant officers.’? 
Anew instrumentality needed.—Superintendent John D, Philbrick, of Boston, called 
cattention in1875 to what must be an essential feature of an effective compulsory law. He 
said: ‘Ina large city it is extremely difficult to execute the law respecting the non- 
{ i 
T'The legislation of previous years regulating the employment of children in manufacturing es: 
tablichineats, ete, was consolidated in 2 general statute about 1859. (24 Mass. Rep., p. 135.) This 
teelite was superseded by the act of 1866 (30 7d., 67-8), and this in turn by the act of 1867 (31 40.. 
47-8), in each of which important changes were made. These different laws had no general or 
4-8) Jury conformity, in regard to age of children concerned, number of weeks of enforced school» 
Tag or mode of enforeement, with either the compulsory attendanee or the truant laws. 
Fie, suing year (1874) this feature of the law was altered, the age being changed again to bo* 
from sight to fourteen years, as before, and the twenty weeks of attendance being divided into 
two consecutive terms of ten weeks each. (33 Mass. Rep., p. 183.)

attendance of children between eight and twelve years of age without the aid of some 
new instrumentality. The truant officers have no means of knowing the whereabouts 
of those nonattendants who are not found wandering about the streets and public 
squares. What is needed isa register of the names, ages, and residences of all chil- 
dren of the prescribed school age. Such a register is found necessary wherever compul- 
sory education is fully carried out.” 
The State superintendent intimated the ensuing year, it may be supposed for the , 
purpose of meeting this objection, that the annual school census supplied the necessary 
means for compiling registers of the character indicated by Mr. Philbrick. ‘The school 
census law required the names and ages of the children to be, taken, and each teacher 
should be supplied with a list of those under his or her jurisdiction. 
Employment of school children at labor.—It has been stated that new compulsory 
attendance and truant laws were enacted in 1873. An act regulating the employment 
of children was introduced at the same session of the legislature, but failed to pass then 
as well as at the two succeeding sessions. In 1876, however, success was attained, and 
the trio of laws designed to secure the attendance of children at school was completed, 
The tew law embraced children in mercantile as well as in manufacturing and me- 
chanical establishments. ‘‘This was done in view of the rapidly increasing numbers of 
small children who were withdrawn from the schools and gathered in the modern re- 
tail stores of immense proportions, as errand boys, cash boys, ete.’’ 
The act embraced all children between ten and fourteen, children under ten not being 
permitted to be employed at all. The term of attendance—twenty weeks—also con- 
formed to that of the compulsory-attendance law. 
By the former law, owners, agents, managers, ete., of the establishments mentioned 
in the bill were subjected to a penalty of $50 for knowingly violating the same. The 
‘*word knowingly completely nullified ’’ that act and in the present one was omitted. 
The execution of the act was given to the truant officers, under the sole direction of 
the school committees, who were thus ‘*made responsible in the last resort for the 
salutary working of the law.’’ 
The leyal machinery complete,—Superintendent White, in recapitulating, asserts that 
the two acts of 1873, the employmentact of 1876, and a new provision *‘ which devolves 
upon the school committees the duty of making the enumeration of all persons between 
the ages of five and fifteen years in their respective cities and towns, constitute a con- 
sistent code, and place in the hands of said committees, so far as legal enactments can 
well do it, an effective machinery, easily worked, for securing the highest possible rate 
of attendance upon the public schools.”?? 
The law regulating the employment of children was subsequently amended, in the 
direction of fixing more completely the responsibility of employers. 
In 1878 it was provided that their share of the income of the school fund should be 
withheld from towns not complying with the laws relating to truancy. Thus a penalty 
for nonenforeement was now for the first time applied, and in 1879 the law was reported 
to be ‘‘enforced’’ by the school committees of 214 towns. 
REPORT OF GEORGE A. WALTON, 1886, 
Practical results of the trio of laws,—George A. Walton, agent of the State board, in 
1886 made a detailed report on ‘‘Schooi Attendance and Truancy,’’* chiefly relating to 
the enforcement of the truant law. Of the compulsory-attendance law proper and the 
employment law, he says: ‘‘ There is one provision in our compulsory laws which is al- 
most entirely inoperative; it is the section which imposes a fine upon the parent*for 
neglecting to send his child to school for twenty weeks each year, Instances of such 
neglect ate common, We often hear of them, but seldom of the parents paying the 
penalty. % 
    
1 Near the close of his term of office, Superintendent White formulated the grounds of the right 
of the State to enact compulsory education laws, as follows: 
First, Because it is the indefeasible right of every child to secure that measure of education and 
training which will fit him to enjoy the privileges and to perform usefully to his fellows and hon- 
orably to himself the duties and oifices of citizenship ; and if this right be withheld by parents or guardians, it is the duty of the State, as the guardian in the last resort of all, to interpose and se- 
‘cure to the child this great right. Second, Since it is the first duty of the Commonwealth to guard its organic life, and maintain its 
highest efficiency for the sake of those great ends for which it exists at all; and since by com- 
on consent it is agreed that the universal education of the people isa necessary condition of such tite, it follows inevitably that it is both the right and the duty to insist, with an outstretched arm if 
need be, upon the education of the whole people, 
Third. It isa manifest injustice to take from the pockets of all the taxpayers, whether having children to be benefited or not, large sums of money for erecting schoolhouses, and opening schools sufficient for the instruction of the whole number of children in the Commonwealth, under the 
sufficient plea that the publie weal demands it, and then to allow these houses to stand teaantless 
or half filled, and these privileges to be wasted, as the indifference, the blindness, or wickedness of 
parents or guardians shall dictate. (87 Mass, Rep.,p. 144,) 250 Mass. Rep. (1885-’86) pp. 163-185.

     “In general, the manufacturing, mechanical, and mereanti e establishments are in 
hearty sympathy and readily coSperate with the officers appointed to enforce the laws 
relating to the employment of children. We are fortunate i e officers whose duty it 
is to inspect these establishments and to make complaints : 8 prosecute violations of 
the laws.’’ i 1 eee 
With regard to truants inquiries were made and responses were received from forty- 
five cities and towns as to compliance with the truant laws. Of these, twenty-seven 
reported unconditionally that the laws were enforced; others reported their enforcement 
in varying degrees. The result as a whole indicated much effective work done to sup- 
press truancy, yet there was considerable truancy that ior various reasons went uncon- 
trolled and unchecked. ‘I'he agent goes on to state: ; 
“‘Where there are no superintendents whose whole business it is to look after the 
schools the enforcement of the laws is dependent upon school committees. The danger 
to some towns of losing their share of the income of the school fund induces a formal 
compliance with the laws, so that now, with a few exceptions, the committees declare 
in their annual returns that the statutes concerning truancy are complied with. But 
the agents of the board find radical defects in the provisions made and often extreme 
laxity in the enforcement of the statutes applicable to truants and absentees from school. 
Sometimes we learn incidentally of cases of truancy, and not infrequently, either in this 
way or through the committee, we hear of whole families of children whose schooling 
is being neglected. { " 
“Many committees are alert in securing constant and punetual attendance of all the 
children in town. Irom the answers of some we are led to more than half suspect that 
an acknowledgment of existing truancy is felt by the committees to be criminating thém- 
selves. Sometimes when we ask if the town has adopted by-laws relating to truancy, 
and if these make all needful provisions for the restraint and instruction of truant 
children, we are met with the response, ‘We have no truants, so no provisions are 
needful.’ ‘ 
“ There is much absenteeism for trifling causes, which is by the consent or require- 
ment of the parents. In many towns there are districts in which are known to exist 
neglected children who are growing up in ignorance and without parental control. The 
truant officer is a harmless body in some of these districts; he does not want to make 
enemies among his neighbors, and therefore does nothing. The arm of the school com- 
mittee is paralyzed by the same prudent regard for comfort. Committeesin some towns 
of considerable population, on applying for permission to assign a certain truant school 
as the place to which their truant children may be committed, have given assurance 
that there will be no truantssent. This shows either insensibility to the beneficent 
rovisions of the law or a foreknowledge which is somewhat remarkable. * * * 
‘‘With all the obstacles to a strict enforcement of the laws, it is safe to assume that 
their provisions are not properly enforced if fewer than one arrest a year is made to 
every 4,000 inhabitants; and probably, were the laws more strictly enforced, there would 
be one to every 3,000 or even 2,000. i 
‘The one county in the State which has a truant school has received all her truants 
convicted within the county from five municipalities, not one from the remaining seven- 
teen; yet these contain one-fifth of the school population. Is it probable that witha 
proper enforcement of the laws not one truant child could be found in these seventeen 
towns? No one can doubt that diligent search would discover many.’’: 
“ Difficulties attending the enforcement of the laws.—The enforcement of the laws relat- 
ing to attendance requires vigilance, and is sometimes attended with difficulties. Pitts- 
field, for example, adopts by-laws which designate as habitual truants ‘forthe purpose 
of these by-laws’ any pupil who absents himself for three or more days without excuse. 
Being submitted to the judge of the superior court for his approval, the by-laws are 
rejected on the ground that it is not competent for the town to state what constitutes a 
truant. So Pittsfield waits till another town meeting. Some informality discovered 
in the by-laws of North Adams leaves her in the same predicament. Instances have 
occurred in which the school committee have secured the adoption by the town of a code 
of by-laws; the State Primary School, the State Reform School, the house of a citizen 
of the town, a certain school therein, the almshouse, or the lockup is named as the place 
for the discipline and instruction of truants. These by-laws must have the approval of 
the judge of the proper court or arrests can not be made underthem. With such places 
of assignment as some of those named, no judge can deliberately approve them. Herc 
the matter rests till another annual town meeting, or perhaps altogether, till the town 
is awakened by finding that through neglect she has forfeited her share of the school 
fund. ; ; 
“The town of Brookline assigns the ‘Home of the Angel Guardian’ as the place for 
the confinement and instruction of her truants; but her by-laws leave it to the option.

tution is managed and controlled by a particular religious denomination, but a pro- 
vision which leaves the town with no absolute control of her truants, She can not be 
said to have made all ‘needful provisions’ concerning this class of persons. 
“Tn the town of the ruling of the judge is that no-truant can be committed to 
the place named in the by-laws of the town, the truant school at Lowell, except by the 
consent-of the parent. Here the intent of the law and the purpose of the town are im- 
peded by a judicial opinion. Irregular attendance, which leads to truancy, results 
from the neglect or overindulgence of parents; too many of these will be in desperate 
straits before they will choose for their children wholesome testraint rather than the 
liberty of the street. x 
‘*A superintendent of one of our cities writes: ‘If you could send us a judge who’ 
would he a little firmer in dealing with the few who need severer treatment than we 
find necessary in most cases, you would make us entirely happy.’ 
‘*Pall River, with her ample means for following up truants, would gladly include in 
her supervision the parochial schools; but their teachers fail to report to the officers, and 
the truants from these schools are reached only as they are found on the streets. 
‘The superintendent of Northampton says: ‘The means employed for enforcing the 
laws are the appointment of two truant officers, who look up all cases of truancy re- 
ported to them, and return the truants to the schools as far as they are able without 
entering a formal complaint against them to the district court. Complaints have been 
entered in some instances, but we find such a course worse than useless, as the magis- 
trate refuses to commit truants to our lockup, which is the only place provided by our 
city for their restraint, discipline, and instruction.’ 
“The enforcement of the laws depends largely upon the judge having jurisdiction. If 
he deems the by-laws to be inadequate in ahy respect he may refuse to convict. Right 
and justice are served by having itso. But every facility should be given for the exe- 
cution of the laws so far as their fundamental purpose, the moral reform of the chil- 
dren, is concerned. .* * * 
“Holyoke has in the last year met with a serious obstacle to the hitherto efficient 
work of her truant officers; this is in the decision of the judge to the effect that the 
truant can not be arrested without a warrant and not until the individual case has 
been passed upon by the school committee and the arrest ordered. The opinion of the 
judge is sustained by that of the city solicitor.’ 
“No such conclusion has been reached elsewhere, and it is a common, if not universal, 
practice in other places for the officer finding upon the street a boy unable to give a 
satisfactory excuse for being out of school and presumably a truant to take him to his 
home or to the school, and only good is known to have resulted from the practice. The 
consciousness that he is liable to be promptly arrested while in the act blunts the appe- 
tite of the truant for the indulgence. 
“* Tyuant schools. —The absence of suitable places for their confinement is a great hin- 
drance to successfully dealing with idle and vicious boys. 
“There has been a popular distrust, not always well founded, I am happy to say, of 
our State reform school. A boy expelled from the public school is kept from the reform 
school for fear, bad as he is, to send him would make him worse. The same feeling is 
entertained regarding the almshouse and the ‘lockup.’ 
“By statute all cities and towns are required to provide themselves with suitable 
places for the restraint, discipline, and instruction of truant children. 
“Tawrence early established for herself an industrial school to which are committed 
this class of persons. She seems to be the only city or town in the State that has lit- 
erally complied with the statutes. Others have virtually met the required conditions 
by assigning this or some other suitable institution as the place for committing their 
truants,” .* *.* : 
‘The superintendent of schools of Fall River says: ‘Our ordinance designates our 
almshouse as the place of confinement, etc., for truants. We have a good schoolroom 
on the premises, and the teacher teaches both the truants and. the pauper children: 
together. The school is a good one of its kind, but the surroundings are not what they 
should be.’ 
“The superintendent at Brockton says: ‘Three [truants] have been sent to the alms- 
house, and several more would have been sentenced if we had had a proper place.’ 
‘The truant school of New Bedford is attached to the almshouse. ‘The institution,’ 
says the superintendent, ‘is by no means what it ought to be, but the fear of it stops 
truancy among the boys. We have no place to which to send truant girls, or with the 
fear of which to frighten mothers into keeping their daughters steadily at school.’ i 
‘Many of the towns have assigned the almshouse as the place for the commitment of 
their truants; none, I believe, without a shadowy sense of the inadequacy of the pro-

  vision; indeed, in most towns, I suspect the provision is ok inname. Onesuch school 
for reform which I have seen, if I may judge from a single visit, itself stands much in 
need of reforming. tf : eet 
“Sometimes the by-laws adopted by the towns name places for the confinement of 
their truants without asking consent of the proper autores. - One set recently brought 
to my notice named the State Primary School at Monson; e authorities of this school 
do not grant the privilege, Hampden County has a Ce noo. A charge of $10 is 
made to every town outside of the county for the privilege of assigning this truant school 
as the place for the discipline of the truants from such town. Several towns have been 
granted the privilege; but as Llearned at a recent visit to the school, only three have ever 
id the charge. ‘The towns which have not paid are not sntitled to send, and so have 
not provided a place for their truants. 
“A law passed in 1873 provided that, on petition of three or more cities ortowns in any 
county, the county commissioners shall establish a truant school for the county. An act 
of 1881 provided that the commissioners of certain counties, and an act of 1884, that 
the commissioners of two, three, or four contiguous countie: shall, on petition as before, 
establish a union truant school. Though in several counties petitions have been pre- 
sented from a sufficient number of towns to meet the conditions of the law, these have 
not been so numerous as to compel the commissioners to obey the law, except in one 
county. Compliance was prompt in Hampden; this county has had a well-ordered county 
truant school for six years in the city of Springfield, = 
‘Some expense attends the arrest and conviction of truants. \ If committed toa truant 
school the town is chargeable with their support. By statute the maximum charge 
against any municipality for the support of its truants in a county truant school is $2 
for each per week: In some towns, it is said the expense is a drawback to the enforce- 
ment of the law. Can it be that the means which might transform many a prospective 
criminal into a self-respecting and respectable member of society, placed in one scale of 
the balance does not outweigh a few dollars placed in the other? 
“Thus from imperfections, real or imagined in the laws, from wrong interpretations of 
them, from the inefficiency in their administration by reason of poorly paid and incom- 
petent officers, and the indifference, ignorance, and cupidity of parents and people, and 
especially from the want of suitable places for the instruction of this class of our chil- 
dren, there exists a large amount of truancy and unnecessary absence from school 
throughout the State. 
‘ How can the laws be made more effective 2—What can be done to secure a better en- 
forcement of existing laws? The laws look primarily for their enforcement to the 
school committees. No more important duty is imposed upon the committees than that 
of securing regular school attendance. They are required to have made, once each year, 
a list of all the children of school age in town, with the age of each; in large towns and 
cities the name of the street where the child lives should be recorded. Thislist should 
be compared with the names in the teachers’ registers. ‘The whereabouts of the ab- 
sentees should be discovered and personal effort should ke made by the committee to 
secure punctual and constant attendance of all who are absent without excuse on account 
of age, occupation, or previous attendance for the required time. 
«Parents often need a personal appeal from the school committee. One of my cor- 
respondents, in reply to the question, ‘ What better means can be provided for control- 
ling truancy ?’ replied, “A new set of parents.’ Some parents wink at, excuse, and 
assume the responsibility for their children’s unnecessary absence. This should be 
met by kindly but emphatic rebuke. They should be made to see that direct practical 
results follow to themselves and their children from the discipline and instruction of 
the schools, If:a child is incorrigible and refuses to accept school privileges at his own 
door, the parent should be led willingly to intrust to the proper authorities the train- 
ing of the child fora brief time in a good school away. In some of our cities parents 
have learned that the officers of the law are acting the part of true friends to their chil- 
dren when they secure their committal to a good truant school. 
“4 most important duty of the committee is to present to the towns for their adop- 
tion a code of by-laws fully complying with the statutes concerning truants, including 
all necessary provisions for their fall and prompt enforcement. Having secured their 
adoption, it is the duty of the committee to see that the provisions are enforced regard- 
less of all else but the interest of the children and thecommunity. There are intima- 
tions in the earlier patt of this report that these duties are not uniformly so discharged. 
Lahoring in this spirit, committees will not connive atthe fraudulent statements of pa- 
rents regarding their children’s age, their own or the children’s condition; nor will 
they blindly make such statements to excuse their own or the town’s neglect. 
‘SAT] necessary provisions relating to truant children include, first, a suitable place 
for their confinement, discipline, and instruction, It should not be a house of correc- 
tion or reformatory, or any place with whichis associated the idea of criminality. It

should not be a poorhouse, suggestive of insanity, infirmity, shiftlessness, and imbecil- 
ity. Truant children are unfortunate in, their constitution or in their surroundings; 
they are often bright, and almost always sensitive; they are wayward, but not criminal; 
they are sometimes more ‘sinned against than sinning;’ they are to be reclaimed. by 
being trained to habits of cleanliness, regularity, and self-respect. After their brief ab- 
sence from society they must not be restored to it witha stigma upon them. They 
have too often come from poor, bad, wicked homes. What they need is the influences 
which pervade the well-ordered Christian family. The institution, whatever it is, to 
which they are sent should be small, not containing much over thirty, including the 
inmates, a teacher, a skilled mechanic, and the superintendent and his wife, or a matron, ° 
who should be virtually father and mother to the children, 
“Connected with the institution should be a few acres of land easy of cultivation; no 
walls need surround it. There should be also a workshop and aschool. The truant 
can often work easier than he can study. Here, under competent directors, work and 
study will alternate. The children will learn to use tools; they will read good books 
and be taught the elements of a good education. At the table, in the sitting or reading 
room, and in their plays, under the eye of a sympathizing friend and guardian, they 
will practice the amenitiesof social life. ‘The school should be furnished witha teacher 
who can and will find in every child some good motive to which to appeal; a teacher who 
can eliminate the bad by augmenting the goed; a teacher who by tact and sympathy, 
and a sincere desire for his welfare, will become an object of personal interest to the 
ehild. «;* ) * * 
“ Number of truant schools needed. —A rough estimate, based upon the fact that about 
one commitment may be anticipated for a population of 4,000 people, shows that the 
several counties should make provision for truants as follows: \   
\ \ County. 'Truants., County, Truants, 
  
Berkshire 
    Middlesex. 
Essex... 
  
BHISRES   61 | Nantucket 
    
‘Tf 3,000 should be taken as the average population for one truant, the number of 
truants.to be provided for would be proportionately increased. If proper provisions 
were made and due vigilance vere exercised in enforcing the laws for compulsory at- 
tendance, probably the number of arrests would considerably exceed the above estimates. 
Tt can be seen from this what the number of truant schools for the whole State should 
be, what counties could unite to maintain one, and what counties would require one or 
more., 
“It is well known that in every town there are children attending school who are 
disobedient and difficult to control. Such nonconforming pupils, while they annoy the 
teacher and interrupt the good order of the school, do not profit by their attendance. 
Whipping, if it were effective, is too unpopular to be a common resort for discipline; 
such pupils have sometimes to be dismissed from the school and turned into the street. 
It has been proposed to so amend our truant laws that on complaint of the school com- 
mittee such pupils shall be sent for short periods of time to truant schools;! the fear of 
being'sent would havea restraining influence. The class of children for which such an 
amendment would provide, though very small, is one that causes a great deal of trouble. 
If such amendment should be made, it would necessitate still larger accommodations in 
the truant schools. 
‘* Truant officers.—Another duty which tie town by-laws devolve upon the school com- 
mittees is to appoint truant officers and fix their salaries. These officers should be dis- 
creet persons, having executive ability combined with a kindly spirit and an elevated 
character, They must know how to manage traants and their parents also. 
“The importance of the services of these officers,’ says Superintendent Cogswell, ‘is 
not to be judged by the number of truants brought before the court, or even by the 
number of cases of truancy which have occurred during the year, but rather by the 
number of children now in our schools, who, but for the watchful care and personal in- 
fluence of these faithful officers, would be wandering about the streets, exposed to the 
dangers and temptations of a vagrant life. They are helpful to parents as well as to 
teachers, and have gained the respect and confidence of both.’ 
‘Superintendent Edgerly, of Fitchburg, says: ‘ Their work does not consist in arresting

boys and endeavoring to send them to reform schools. Pe this. Parents and pupils oftentimes need advice more than cei from school because they haye not sufficient clothing. There is work at home to be done and the child must do it. The interposition of a benevo nt society is needed more than that of the officer of the Jaw. Oceasionally there will be found a family careless or stubborn in regard to this subject, the parents refusing to allow the attendance of the children when there is no good reason for nonattendance. The strong arm of the law must deal with these exceptional cases.’ i ‘‘ When no attempt is made to enforce the laws, the schools become demoralized by irregular attendance, illiteracy increases, vagrants abound, the vicious and criminal classes are augmented. Any feeble or partial enforcement of the laws may serve only toshowthe extent of the absenteeism without holding it in check. The number of convictions for tru- ancy might increase even, and yet the evil might not becontrolled. It.is only when the right kind of men are employed as officers that truancy is kept within narrow limits. The experience of one sity is like that of many. In one, under a defective system for executing the laws from 1865 to 1873, truancy was rife; thirty-five truants were com- mitted in one year, In ote a proper truant school wasestablished. One efficient offi-    
cer was employed. Idle boys were no longer found in ie streets, absenteeism was ‘sensibly diminished, and the commitments for truancy were reduced to less than one- half their former number, i ‘In the smaller towns few requisitions will be made upon the truant officer; he will attend to special cases brought to his knowledge by the teacher or school committee, Cities and towns of ten thousand inhabitants or more should have at least one officer who is subject to immediate call; his compensation should be such as to enable him to give all his time to the service, In the smaller of these cities and towns he may have some other duties, such as taking the school census and distributing school supplies. He should become acquainted with the people, know of all new families moving into town, and see that their children are placed in school, In larger cities he will not neglect these duties, but he will be mainly employed, especially during school hours, in look- ing after truants and absentees. He will secure the codperation of the employers of children who work in manufacturing and other establishments. ‘This will involve his seeing that children discharged from work shall at once return to school. Especially should it be his duty to arrange with overseers of mills a system by which, without break between school and work, the classes of pupils who are required to attend school can pass from one to the other. 
‘*The duties of these officers are greater in number and variety than the name truant officer would imply. A vigilant officer with a codperative police force will make the streets and by-ways of a large city as lonesome to a boy as the tombs of the dead, and the school room, in comparison, a delight. 
“ Where the time of one well-paid officer—or more than one if the service demands it—is exclusively devoted to the work, the results reached are the most satisfactory. The most effective work is done in the cities. Here, officers give their entire time to it. At the commencement of each school session they are notified of all suspected cases of truancy. For this purpose the teacher fills out and furnishes to the officer blank forms giving the circumstances of each ease, including the name and residence of the absentee. ‘The officer at once attends to looking up the absent pupil; dependent upon what the facts are, the absentee is excused, placed in the sc 00], or under arrest to be brought to trial. A return of the case is made to the teacher or committee, * * * “The surest means for reducing truancy and absenteeism to their smallest terms is to improve the schools, ‘Make the schools so good,’ says one of my correspondents, ‘that the people will want the children to attend.’ Says another, ‘ We rely largely upon the personal efforts of teachers and superintendents—upon the officers last; we make but few arrests.’ And still another says, ‘Put more emphasis upon moral means, less upon the merely restrictive. ‘To this end have better teachi , more personai work by teachers and school officials, more attractive school rooms.’ ‘The best means to reduce truancy,’ says a fourth, ‘is to place a good teacher in every school room. As long asin- ferior teachers are employed, and parents are ignorant and Toth ed, so long shall we have, a certain amount of truancy.’ t t i “Changes in the law tecommended.—A tew suggestions looking to modifications in the Jaws and to additional means for their enforcement will conclude what I have to say upon this subject.! aie : : ““Y. The laws relating to the employment of children in manufacturing and other establishments should be extended to all kinds of wage labor. “2. The attendance of eyery well child should be required from the age of seven to - twelve, during the whole time the schools keep; from twelve to fifteen for two terms a year, and for the whole time, unless the child is at work, i 
         
   
Some of the changes recommended haye since been made. The present law is given, pp. 481-5,

‘‘The reasons for this are: First, if under twelve years of age, children can not be 
employed to work in manufacturing or other establishments during the days the schools 
keep. Second, the children of well-to-do people attend school the whole time. Third, 
by being allowed to stay out of the school half the time, as they may where the schools 
seep forty weeks, those least disposed to attend school can waste half their time in con- 
tracting the itinerant habits of the truant, and, by associating with others, help to 
swell the vagrant class. , 
“©3, In case the’children are in need of clothing suitable for attending school, and 
parents are unable to provide it, or are in circumstances to need help, it should be fur- 
nished by the town, and not at ‘the expense of the child’s schooling. 
‘*4, So far as possible, the parents should be held responsible for the children’s ab- 
ence from school, whether it be caused by truancy or otherwise. * * * 
*5, In ease of absence from school the burden of proof should be thrown upon the 
parent; he should be required to show that his child’s absence is necessary, or that his 
education is otherwise properly provided for. At present the school official is obliged 
to prove that the education is being neglected. 
“6, By imposing the penalties, and making them greater if need be, towne should 
be encouraged to more fully comply with the laws relating to truancy and absenteeism. 
“7. Provision should be made for enforcing the laws relating to truancy by a State 
official. The principal reliance in the State of Connecticut, outside of four cities, for 
executing the Jaws is one State agent. Under his administration sixty-five fines have 
been imposed for noncompliance with the laws requiring parents to send their children 
to school within a period of nine years, while under our system, with local officers to 
enforce the law, not one-tenth as many are known to have been imposed in the period 
of thirty-five years that our law has been in force, and this with our larger population. 
**g. Truant officers should be empowered to make arrests for the purpose of placing 
in school or for temporary detention ‘under the general instruction of school committees. 
‘9. If the law under which county commissioners are required to provide truant 
schools is inadequate, amend it. Then let towns petition for and insist upon their estab- 
lishment.

that, instead of $2 a week being charged to the town for the support of her children

four years; also provide a board of visitors for every such school. ’

able rules and regulations of the common schools may be sent, upon complaint of school 
committees, for brief periods of time to the truant school.

‘«The grounds for many of these suggestions are shown in the illustrations already 
given. I need not state the reasons for others; these will at once occur to the reader; 
they are all occasioned by something observed or brought to my notice during the year. 
Though they may seem to reflect discredit upon our truant laws and upon their enforce- 
ment, it is doubtless true that the provisions of these laws as a whole are wiser and 
better than those of any other State, and that where they are faithfully enforced they 
are as effective as any laws upon the statute-book.’’ 
THE PRESENT LAW OF MASSACHUSETTS. 
The following are the Massachusetts laws now in force, including the amendments of 
1889, which are indicated by italics in the text and by foot notes. They are the out- 
come of forty years’ experience in compulsory attendance legislation, and deserve care- 
‘ul study by those interested in this matter.

Statutes.)

Arr, 3, ‘Two or more truant officers shall be appointed annually, whose duty it shall be to inquire into all the violations of the truant laws and of the law relating to compulsory education, and to do ali the acts required of them by the laws of the Commonwealth. Arr. 4, It shall be the duty of every truant officer, previous to making any complaint under these laws, to notify the truant orabsentee from school, also his parent or guardian, of the offence com- mitted and of the penalty therefor; and if the truant officer can obtain satisfactory pledges for the restraint and reformation of the child he may, at his discretion, forbear to prosecute, so long as such pledges are faithfully kept. _ Arr. 5, It shall be the duty of the school committee, the teachers of the public schools, and the cilizens generally, to aid the truant officers as far as possible in the discharge of their duties. Anz. 6, It shall be the duty of the truant officers to keep a full record of all their official acts, and make an annual report thereof to the school committee, who shall publish the same with their own report. ‘ Art. 7.

rection, truant schools for the confinement, discipline, and instruction of minor children convicted 
under the provisions of sections ten and twelve; aud shall make suitable provisions for the gov- 
ernment and control, and for the appointment of proper teachers and officers thereof; but if three 
or more cities or towns in each of two or three coutiguous counties so require, the county com- 
missioners of such counties shall, at the expense of the same, establish at aconvenient place therein 
a union truant school, to be organized and controlled by the chairman of the county commission- 
ers of such counties, in the manner provided for the government ani control of county truant 
schools by county commissioners; and any county so uniting with another county or counties in 
the support of a union truant school shall not be required to support a truant school of its own.

Practical effects of the child-labor statute—Superintendent E. P. Seaver, of Boston, says 
(March, 1889): ‘' The work of investigating the cases ot children whose parents apply 
for certificates, explaining to them the requirements of the law, filling out, duplicat- 
ing, and indexing the certificates granted takes one person nearly the whole working 
Timen AEA 
“Itis, perhaps, too early to make observationson the practical effects of the new statute. 
Already proposals to amend it have been made in the legislature. But it should have 
a fair and thorough trial by steady enforcement for at least a year. Some of the diffi- 
culties incident to the change from the old law to the new may be expected to disap- 
pear in time and the good effects to show themselves more distinctly. The very marked 
improvement in school attendance’ among children thirteen and fourteen years old, 
shown by the statistics, is probably due in part to the new law. 
‘Still I feel impelled to say that this new law is a very hard law to enforce. No 
man who has not a heart of stone can listen to the pitiful tales of distress, seeing the 
little wages of a thirteen-year-old child are all that stand between a bereaved family 
and starvation, without urdently wishing he had the power to mitigate the stern dic-     
tates of the law. The temptation to break the laws of men and rely for justification | 
on the higher law is very strong—may become overpowering if the legislature does not 
soon provide some way of relief in cases of dire need. ¢ 
‘On the other hand, the amount of falsehood, chicanery, and fraud attempted among 
certain classes of employers, parents, and children in relation to the employment cer- 
tificates, is such as to perplex the most astute and dishearten the most humane admin- 
istrator of the law.’’ 
Between 1,700 and 1,800 certificates of age and schooling had been issued in Boston 
since the new statute went into force. A large number had been refused. 
From Chicopee (Superintendent R. H. Perkins) comes thereport: ‘* Parental indiffer- 
ence, together with the demand for child labor, and the not too strict regard paid by many 
employers to the employment laws, make the duties of these (truant) officers, as well as 
  
1Penalty for employing truants.—Chapter 71 of the acts of 1885 provides that whoever, after notice from a truant officer to refrain from so doing, offersa reward for service to anychild, in consequence of which reward such child is induced unlawfully to absent himself from school, or whoever, after notice as aforesaid, in any manner entices or induces any child to truancy, or whoever knowingly employs or harbors any unlawful absentec {rom school, or truant, shall forfeit not less than twenty’ nor moré than fifty dollars to the use of the public schools of the city or town in which said offence occurs, to be recovered by complaint. (Norr.—No one is authorized to proseente in order to enforce this provision of the law. In order to test the matter a certain truant officer of Boston made complaints in two aggravated cases; the judge refused to entertain them on the ground that the truant officer had no legal authority to make them.—Rep. Sup’t. Bost. Sch., 1888., p. 11.)

those of the superintendent, at times somewhat difficult and unpleasant. ‘The officers 
report but two cases of illegal employment; the superintendent has observed many 
more, yet no prosecutions have been ordered.” ie 3 
Supt. William Connell, of Fall River: “The labors of the truant officers are not to be 
measured by the number of truants returned to school or brought before the.court for 
trial, but rather by the larger number of way wardly inclined children kept in the schools 
py their influence and daily visits.’’ \ } 
Under date of January 27, 1890, State Supt. J. W. Dickinson writes to this Office as 
follows: ‘The compulsory law operates well, and is generally obeyed. The employ- 
ment law is quite thoroughly enforced. There is not much temptation in rural districts 
to break these laws, so not so much stringency is required to enforce them as in cities.” 
Considerable difficulty is experienced by school authorities in procuring suitable places 
for the confinement and education of habitual truants and ineorrigibles. In Boston 
truants are still sentenced to the House of Reformation for Juvenile Offenders, a crim- 
‘inal institution, notwithstanding the efforts of the school board to have a truant, or 
‘parental, ’’ school established. Magistrates are reluctant to cominit ordinary truants 
to an institution of this character. In Fall River truants are sent to the almshouse, 
where there is no school. Superintendent Connell, of that city, considers it an outrage 
upon defenseless pauper children ‘when truants, often the yilest boys in the city, are 
sent there to ve their associates, and to exert upon them their contaminating and de- 
basing influence.’ 
The county commissioners of Essex County have neglected to establish a truant school, 
though double the number of citiesand towns required by law have repeatedly petitioned 
to that effect. Four counties, Berkshire, Hampden, Hampshire, and Norfolk, have com- 
plied with the law and are supporting county truant schools. 
‘A. W, Edson, agent of the Massachusetts State Board of Education for Hampden and 
Worcester Counties, reports to the board December 31, 1889: “The law requires school 
committees to appoint and fix the compensation of two or more suitable persons as truant 
officers, whose duty it shall be to attend to all cases of truancy. In most towns, not in 
all, such officers are appointed. Ina few cases these men are active, and, as well as 
they are able, do their duty in enforcing regular attendance in the public schools. Of 
course they can do Haale where there is no place to which to send habitual truants. In 
most towns, owing to the fact that there is no truant school, to the small compensation 
allowed, to the fear of offending neighbors and friends, or to the indifference of the com- 
mittee, the officers do practically nothing, and the law is a dead letter.” 
CONNECTICUT. : 
Early legislation. —Vhe first code of laws of the Connecticut colony, adopted 1650, con- 
ained a provision for obligatory education which was a literal transcript of the Massa- 
husetts law of 1642, already given. A fine of twenty shillings was imposed ‘‘ for each 
 neglect.’? Selectmen of towns, after suitable admonition had failed, were required to 
take the children of negligent parents and bind them out with persons who would look 
after their education. Parents were also required to instruct their children in religion. 
These provisions, more or less modified, have remained in force to the present day, 
and are incorporated in therrevision of 1888, some of the ancient phraseology being still 
retained. y } 
The code of the New Haven colony, completed in 1655, contained similar requirements 
and penalties, ; 
Tt seems that some parents and masters failed to comply with these laws, for in 1690 
anadditional order was made by the court, which observed in the preamble that ‘‘there are 
many persons unable to read the English tongue, and uncapable to read the holy word 
of God.” ‘ i 
In the revision of 1805 the penalty of twenty shillings was given as $3.34; in 1821 
this fine for neglect disappears from the statute, though contumacious parents were still 
Jiable to have their children taken from under their care, as before. In this shape the 
Jaw was of little or no effect as a general compulsory measure, the severity of the pen- 
alty being such that public opinion would not sanction the enforcement of it except in 
‘yery extreme cases, 
Tn 1821 the requirement concerning religious instruction also disappeared, it being re- 
placed by arithmetic, and in 1849 English grammar and geography were added. 
In 1813 the proprietors of manufacturing establishments were compelled to see that the 
children in their empty were taught to read, write, and cipher, and that due attention 
was paid to their morals. ‘To secure observance of this law, the selectmen of towns

were constituted boards of visitors to ascertain annually the facts of the case and report 
any neglect to the next county court. 
Dr. Barnard said, in 1840, of this law: ‘‘It is a dead letter in nearly if notevery town 
in the State. I know not of a single instance where the board of visitation authorized 
by the act has been organized.”’ 
Employment act of 1842.—The act of 1842 forbade, under a penalty of twenty-five dol- 
lars for each violation, the employment of children under fifteen years of age unless they 
had been instructed’ in school at least three months of the twelve preceding. State 
Superintendent D. C, Gilman remarked of this law in 1866: ‘‘It has been found very 
difficult to enforce this law. In many cases the proprietors or agents of manufacturing 
establishments would willingly see the provisions ot the statute sustained, but they are 
well aware that the law is not obeyed through the State, and are apprehensive that ey 
shall lose both parents and children as operatives if they reiuse the latter work, eee 
Iam confident that if law can be devised which public opinion will sustain and which 
the magistrates and school visitors throughout the State will be likely to enforce, the large 
manufacturing corporations will codperate. * * * It may be said that the present 
Jaw is good enough. But it is not enforced; it is not likely to. be. Nobody assumes 
the responsibility of seeing that its requirements are obeyed,” 2“ Prosecutions are un- 
heard of for the violations of the law.” ‘‘Public opinion does not cry out for the exe- 
cution of the law.’?* 
Truant act of 1865,.—-In 1865 there was enacted a truant law, based on the then exist- 
ing Massachusetts truant law, which had been gradually gathering shape since 1950, 
New employment law (1869).—The defects of the employment act of 1842 led to the 
enactment of a new law in1869, which differed from the former one in several important 
particulars, viz: (1) The age of children forbidden to be employed without three months’ 
schooling the preceding year, was changed from fifteen to fourteen years. (2) Under 
the law of 1842, only manufacturers, agents, and superintendents could be prosecuted; 
under that of 1869, all employers were liable to prosecution. (3) The penalty for each 
offense was raised from twenty to one hundred dollars. (4) The act of 1842 charges 
school visitors with examining into the execution of the law and reporting violations of 
it; that of 1869 requires in addition, State attorneys and. grand juries to codperate, and,   
«what was the most important change in providing for the enforcement of the law, it au- 
thorized the State board of education to ‘‘appoint some one of its members, or some 
other suitable person, an agent for that purpose.’? This agent was to be at all times 
subject to the direction and control of the board. Previously, the enforcement of the 
employment laws had been left entirely with the local authorities, and ‘‘ very little 
was accomplished.’’ 
An act to put discharged children to school.—The employment law of 1869 took children 
out of the factories, but it did not send them to school. This was effected by a law of 
1871, requiring parents, guardians, and others to send to school children who had been « 
discharged from employment for the purpose of atténding school, on penalty of five: 
dollars for every week of noncompliance. 
“The only objection made to this law, within my knowledge,’’ said State Superin- 
tendent Northrop, ‘is its limitation to the parents and guardians of those children who 
are hired out. They ask, ‘While we are justly required to send our children to school, 
why are the parents of children unemployed, it may be the idle and vicious, excused ?? 
This has the look of class legislation. Make this law impartial and universal in its 
obligation, and you remove the only real objection as yet urged against it.’’ 
During the year 1871 Dr. Northrop made a foreign tour, during which he examined 
the operation of the compulsory laws of several European countries. On his return he 
incorporated the results of his observations with other matter in a report on ‘‘ Obliga= 
tory Education,’’ which attracted wide attention, and stimulated action in other States 
as well as Connecticut. A portion of his argument is quoted farther on. 
The compulsory system fully established in 1872.—The final step suggested by Superin- 
tendent Northrop was taken the following year (1872). The law of 1871 was made ap- 
plicable to all children, whether employed or not; at the same time the employment and 
truant ‘acts were incorporated with it, and the wholerevised. The system of legislation 
requiring universal education in Connecticut, ia its modern form, dates from this year. 
The law as originally proposed contained a provision to the effect that parents whose 
“pecuniary ‘condition was such as to render the attendance of their children inexpedi- 
ent or impracticable’? should be exempt from its requirements. But on motion of 
a leading member of the house this provision was unanimously stricken out, thus com- 
mitting the State to the position that poverty should be no bar to education. Public 
charity must supply the wants of dependent parents when necessary.

Sue. 30, Selectmen may bind out neglected children.—The selectmen in every town shall inspect the 
conduct of the heads of families, and if they find any who neglect the education of the children 
under their care, may admonish’ them to attend to their duty; and if they continue negligent, 
whereby the children grow rude, stubborn, and unruly, they shall, with the advice of a justice of 
the peace, take such children from those who have the charge of them, and bind them out to some 
proper master or to some charitable institution or society incorporated in this State for the careand instruction of such children, males till twenty-one and females till eighteen years of age, that they

ANALYSIS OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE CONNECTICUT LAW RELATING TO TEE IN- 
STRUCTION AND EMPLOYMENT OF CHILDREN.! 
1. Who may attend.—‘‘Schools shall be open to all children over four years of age in 
the respective districts without discrimination on account of race or color.’? But chil- 
dren under five may be excluded ‘‘whenever in their (the school visitors’) judgment 
the interest of the school will be thereby promoted.’’ , 
“Children’’ would probably comprise legal infauts. Whether this be so or not, there 
is no legal ground fr rejecting from schools persons over sixteen. Boards of visitors 
may make rules relating to such matters. ‘ 
II. Who must attend.—‘‘ Every parent or other person having control of any child over 
eight and under sixteen years of age shall cause such child to attend.”’ 
The persons who must attend, unless legally excused, are all children over eight and 
under sixteen years of age. This is the limit of compulsory schooling in the State.

II. Possible attendances. —"' Public schools shall be maintained for at least thirty-six 
weeks in each year, in every school district in vwhicel Ghee number of persons between 
four and sixteen years of age at the last preceding enumeration was one hundred or 
more; and for at least thirty weeks in every district in which the number of persons 
between said ages was twenty-four or more; and for at least twenty-four weeks in the 
other districts’? (sec. 40). fea 
“School committees shall see that good public schools of the different grades are 
maintained in the various parts of the town, for not Jess than the same length of time 
as would be required had no such consolidation been made’? (see. 129). 
IV. How long and when elvildren must attend.—Parents must cause their children to 
attend * * * ‘ 
(a) ‘Regularly ”” (sec. 21). 
(b) ‘‘During the hours and terms while public schools in the district wherein such 
child resides are in session’? (sec. 21). ? 
Instruction at home and attendance at private school are recognized excuses for non- 
attendance in public schools as stated below; put this instruction at home or in a private 
school must be: 
(a) During the hours (see. 21). 
(b) During the terms (sec. 21). 
(c) And in the studies taught in the public schools (sec. 21). 
There should be no misunderstanding with regard to these requirements. Instrue- 
tion elsewhere than in a public school can not be a cover for no instruction, or for such 
jnstruction as the caprice or convenience of parents or others may determine. Without 
. question instruction must be in the English language. 
Parents can incur the penalty of section 22 only for such weeks as the schools are in 
session. wi 
The prescribed studies are mentioned in the first paragraph of section 21 and in sec- 
tion 40, 
V. Recognized excuses,—The excuses recognized under the law are: 
1. Thorough instruction elsewhere during the hours and terms of the public schools 
and in the studies taught in the public schools (sec. 21). 
This would admit: i 
(a) Instruction at home. 
(b) Instruction in private schools. Private schools, however, must conform to the 
requirements of section 23, or attendance will not be regarded as compliance with the 
provisions of section 21, 
2, Such physical or mental condition as renders instruction inexpedient or impractica- 
ble (sections 21, 22). f 
3, Destitution of clothing and inability of parents to provide the same. The burden 
of proving such destitution and inability is upon the parent (section 22). 
4, The most important recognized excuse for nonattendance is employment.. The law 
on this subject may be summarized as follows: 
(a) All over fourteen may be employed. i 
(5) Children between thirteen and ‘fourteen may be employed if they have attended 
‘ school 60 days within the preceding 12 months (section 21). 
(ec) Children under thirteen aud over eight may be employed if they have attended 
420 days within the previous school year (section 21). 
But children under thirteen can not be employed in mechanical, manufacturing, or 
/ mercantile establishments at any time. 
‘State administration of the law.—There were in 1888 four agents of the State board of 
education charged with executing the provisions of the law relating to the attendance 
andemployment. The local authorities codperate with these, but seldom take the initia- 
tive. ‘‘In very few towns are any steps taken by local authorities to enforce the law.””* 
“In three out of fifty towns local authorities have acted.”?? On the other hand, State 
Agent Giles Potter says: * ‘* While in some towns the local authorities have done noth- 
ine toward enforcing these compulsory laws, the number of towns where notice is taken of 
failure of children to attend school, and in which efforts are made by school officers by 
means of notices and personal admonitions, is increasing. More towns and districts are 
appointing truant officers, and aid is constantly solicited from agents of the State board. 
This local influence and coéperation should be encouraged in every community or the 
Jaws can not therein be effectively enforced. I therefore deprecate any legislation and 
any measures which seem to relieve towns of responsibility concerning this matter of 
attendance or any other matter affecting the schools.’” 
To what degree enforced.—Hon. Charles D, Hine, secretary of the State board, writes to 
the bureau as follows (January 28, 1890): ‘In general the law is more effective in rural

districis than in cities, because () there are fewer cases compared with the whole num- 
ber of pupils; (J) they are easier to get at. 
“Phe method pursued in case of the rural districts is to have a whole county aor 
oughly canvassed. Every family which has children is noted, and the attendance or 
nonattendance recorded by the agent. All cases of nonattendance are investigated, and 
children are brought to school. Thereafter families that have been or are likely to be 
delinquent are inquired about by letter, and if they are not sending their children to 
school an agent issent. Sometimes it is necessary to keep the record for a month ortwo, 
and then send the agent upon a round of visits. 
‘The difficulty is in compelling regular attendance. Our Jaw requires 120 days at- 
tendance. Schools must now be in session 150 days. We find difficulty in compelling 
children to attend the extra 30 days above the compulsory limit. There is a little con- 
fusion in the law as to whether 120 or 60 days attendance is required, but the courts 
are with us on the question, and we have no difficulty in compelling 120 days up to the 
age of thirteen. 
“The per cent. of attendance ai as compared with the enumeration in this State does 
not run much above 53. This seems to be a small showing for our compulsory system, 
but it is really a remarkably good showing. Parents are not under legal obligation to 
send their children until they are eight, and they can put them to work between thir- 
teen and fourteen for all except 120 days, Between these ages of eight and thirteen 
we secure almost entire conformity to thelaw. Between thirteen and fourteen we are 
not so successful. After fourteen we have considerable difficulty in port pelling even 
those not employed to attend school. 
“The system has the support of the people of the State. The gencral assembly 
gives the board all tie means it asks for enforcement, end the board regards the enlorce- 
ment as on the whole satisfactory. , This is not saying that it can not be more exactly 
enforced, but that there are comparatively few cases of violation within the compulsory 
iap.2?

forcement of the attendance laws by the State agents:

Cases of parents being fined or imprisoned for noncompliance with the provisions of 
the law relating to compulsory attendance, pure and simple, are of frequent occurrence, 
It is believed that Connecticut is the only State where such fine or imprisonment has 
ever been enforced. 
Unceasing activity in enforcement.—The Connecticut law owes its efficacy in great meas- 
ure to the unremitting persistency with which it has been enforced. It has been the 
settled policy of the State board to allow aglnauents no rest in so far as its agents could 
reach them. The practice of making— 
A scarecrow of the law, 
Setting it up to fear the birds of prey, — till custom make it Their perch, and not their terror— 
has been replaced by one of energetic enforcement. Especial emphasis is laid upon 
this point in the report of the board for 1878, which says (p. 6): ‘‘ Unceasing vigilance 
and activity are required to resist the strong tendency among the juvenile population 
towards slipping back into idleness and truancy. * * * The work of one year will 
never answer for the next. Efforts to restrain truancy may not be relaxed) for so much 
as a single term without engendering evils which can never be wholly eradicated.” ,

Moral suasion and arg) ments have been resorted t to | nforce the law whenever they 
would effect the purpose in hand, as they generally do. Butthe determination has been 
firm to enforce the penalties of the law in cases of stubborn resistance. Examples are 
made of offenders which have an incaleulably wholesome though silent influence for good. 
‘In 1889 twenty-six prosecutions of parents and seven of employers for noncompliance 
are recorded; seven hundred and sixty-four children illegally absent were sent to school. 
The rights of children.—In the Connecticut system parents and employers are pun- 
ished for nonattendance of children, not the children themselves. The childrenarethe 
parties sinned against. It is considered the duty of the State to protect children from 
the neglect or rapaciousness of parents and employers, and to secure to them their rights, 
both out of regard for its own welfare and as a measure of abstract justice. This theory 
is well defined, and the practice of the authorities has been conducted in strict accord- 
ance with it. ‘Three years’ observation of the child-labor law and execution of ‘its 
provisions,” says Secretary Hine, ‘‘supply abundant evidence of its benefits to children. 
‘This is the only view this departmentcan consider. The greed of parents is restrained, 
the rights of parents are respected by employers.’” t i 
The general subject of the relations of parents to their children is thus discussed: 
‘*Thereare many parents who assert what they call their rights of governance. Such 
think ituajust that they must send their children to school, and thus lose the profit of 
their labor. Others, timid about interfering with the relation of parent and child, pre- 
fer that the child should suffer abuse and deprivation rather than disturb the principle 
of parental control. Pg 
“There is no necessity for confusion or hesitation here. That parents may have the 
governance of their children is not an unalterable principle upon which unchangeable 
laws are based. It is only a proposition based upon extensive experience and embody- 
ing the general conviction that parents, inspired by instinctive love, will treat their chil- 
dren wisely and humanely. Thereis a strong probability that they will so treat them. 
This presumption of good will yield to a certainty of evil. When it is certain that a 
parent is injuring his child a point is reached where society says his action is not rea- 
sonable, and the law says itis not lawful. It may be unreasonable long before it is 
unlawful, but it is merely a question of degree when the legal limit is overstepped. 
“Responsibility for the education of the child is placed upon the parent. It is ad- 
mitted that the parent may and ought to understand what is the best education for his 
own children. But atthe point of no education or of limited education resulting in 
mental starvation, the law undertakes to make the parent do his duty. If in the ex- 
ercise of his judgment and right of contro] the parent gives no education he has over- 
stepped the reasonable limit of control and transgressed the positive enactment. He is 
now compelled to do what he ought to do. 
“Similarly there is no principle which confers upon a parent the right to cause his 
child to work for gain or for the support of the family. It is [not] supposed that the 
labor which the parent compels the child to perform will result in goodtothe child. If 
the mind or body of the child is injured by work in any industry, the limit of reason 
is again overstepped, and the law compels the parent) to refrain from doing what he 
ought not to do. Both in depriving the child of education and in causing him to spend 
his early years in labor the parent is not conforming to what the experience and con- 
-yietions of society regard as right. He is not acting in a reasonable manner, and the 
Jaw says he is not acting in a Jawful manner. eu uty 
- The enactments relating to attendance and employment have restrained and miti- 
gated in many cases the harshness of parental control. I/they have accomplished noth- 
ing more their operation has been beneficent.” ‘ 
The employment law does not work hardship.—Mr. Giles Potter, agent of the board, 
wrote in 1883: ‘The law very wisely does not make the pecuniary condition of the 
- parent an excuse for depriving a child of opportunity to attend school. Towns have 
in such cases furnished assistance which otherwise would not have been required. I 
have myself presented requests in behalf of unfortunate families for such aid. The ap- 
plications were cheerfully met, and I have never known towns or selectmen complain 
that such demands were unreasonable. * * * The number of such families and the 
amounts required are so small that it.can not be said that pauperism is thereby increased ; 
eventually the families, by the education of their children, are made less dependent, 
.since families whose children attend school regularly earn more in the course of the 
year than those'who bring up their children in ignorance.”’ 
The replies of the selectmen of six large manufacturing towns, when interrogated by 
Mr. Potter on this subject, were substantially in accordance with the above.” ‘ 
If the enforced depriving parents of the proceeds of their children’s labor ‘‘ were at- 
tended with hardship to many, or even to few, there would be room to question the

humanity of the law, however much its justice might be admitted. The cases of hard- 
ship do not frequently come to light, and when they are found are easily remediable 
without resorting to ‘child labor.’ It must be borne in mind that the law applies to 
children of tender years, whose right it is to have schooling. _ If the misfortune or shift- 
lJessness of parents has ‘resulted in poverty, shall the burden of this fall upon young 
ebildren?’?? 
Objections to compulsory education answered.—In 1872 Hon. B, G. Northrop, then sec- ‘ 
retary of the State board, replied as follows to certain arguments that had been adduced 
against the compulsory law:? 
‘1. Such a law would create a new crime. Ireply, it ought to. To bring up chil- ¥ 
dren in ignorance is a crime and should be treated assuch. As the most prolific source 
of criminality, it should be under the ban of legal condemnation and the restraint of legal 
punishment. All modern civilization and legislation has made new crimes. Barbarism 
recognizes but few. To employ children in factories who are under 10 years of age, or 
who have not attended school, or to employ minors under 18 years of age more than 12 
hours a day, is each a new crime. 
‘*2. It interferes with the liberty of parents. I reply again, it ought to, when they 
are incapacitated by vice or other causes for the performance of essential duties as par- 
ents. Many other laws limit personal liberty. ‘Che requisition to serve on juries, or to 
aid the sheriff in arresting criminals, or the exactions of military service in the hour of 
the country’s need, these and many other laws do this. If the law may prohibit the 
owner from practicing cruelty upon his horse or ox it may restrain the parent from 
dwarfing the mind and debasing the character of his child. If the state may imprison 5 
and punish juvenile criminals it may remove the causes of their crime and its conse- 
quences of loss, injury, and shame. The child has rights which not even a parent may 
violate. He may not rob his child of the sacred right of a good education. ‘he law 
would justly punish a parent for starving his child, and more mischief is done by starv- 
ing the mind than by famishing the body. The right of a parent to his children is 
founded on his ability and disposition to supply their wants of body and mind. When 
a parent is disqualified by intemperance, cruelty, or insanity, society justly assumes the i 
control of the children. In ancient Greece the law gave almost unlimited authority to 
the father over hisoffspring. The same istruein some semibarbarous nations now. In 
all Christian lands the rights of the parents are held to imply certain correlative duties, 
and the duty to educate is as positive as to feed and clothe. Neglected children, when 
not orphans in fact, are virtually such, their parents ignoring their duties and thus tor- 
feiting their rights as parents. The state should protect the helpless, and especially 
these, its defenseless wards, who otherwise will be vicious as well as weak. 
“3, It arrogates new power to the government. So do all quarantine and hygienic 
regulations and laws for the abatement of nuisances. Now ignorance is noxious as the 
most offensive nuisance aud more destructive than bodily contagions. Self-protection 
is a fundamental law of society. 
“4. It is un-American and unadapted to our free institutions. To put the question 
in the most offensive form, it may be asked, ‘Would you have policemen drag your chil- 
dren to school?’ I answer, ‘ Yes, if it will prevent his dragging them to jail a few years 
hence.’ But this Jaw in our land would invoke no ‘dragging,’ and no police espionage, 
or inquisitorial searches. With the annual enumerations and the school registers in 
hand and the aid of the teachers and others most conversant with each district, school 
officers could easily learn who are the absentees.’” 
               
                    
            
        
      
        
    
  NEW YORK. 
             In 1866 the assembly of New York adopted a resolution calling upon the State suner- 
intendent of public instruction for information respecting the compulsory-attendance 
Jaws of other States and of foreign countries. In obedience thereto, State Superintend- Wy 
ent Victor M. Rice submitted a carefully prepared report in which his opinion as to 
compulsory school attendance was summed up in the following language: ‘‘I doubt the 
expediency of laws compelling parents and guardians to send their children and wards 
of a proper school age to the public schools, or to provide education for them at home 
or at private schools, until the persuasive power of good teachers, commodious and com- 
fortable schoolhouses, and free schools shall have been tried, and tried in vain.’? 
No further action was taken with regard to compulsory education until 1871, when a 
bill for that purpose was introduced into the assembly. State Superintendent Abram * 
B. Weaver, in his report of that year, discussed the whole subject with much care, and 
strongly opposed the proposition to make education compulsory, principally on the 7 
ground that it was at variance with the principles of free institutions. ‘‘The citizens .

education as in other r spects if they would remain their own masters.”” The bill failed 
to become alaw. — ‘ hss b 
‘The question continued to be extensively discussed, however, and an act was finally 
passed, May 11, 1874, which, with the amendments of 1876, is the law in force at the 
present day, The following is the text of-the'law? (!)1F 7) ;

  The position of Superintendent Gilmour.—Hon. Neil Gilmour, the then State superintend- 
ent, while not considering the act unconstitutional, expressed his conviction that the sys- 
tem should not have been introduced into New York until after some years of careful 
preparation; in his view ample school accommodations should have been provided, the 
quality of the instruction improved, and provision made for the care of truants and va- 
grants, before having had recourse to any compulsory measures. ‘‘I am also decidedly 
of the opinion,” he went on to say, ‘‘that if we can, under a'voluntary system, closely 
approximate the results which we aim to reach by the enactment of a compulsory law, 
it will be better not to have such a law upon our statute books.’’? He expressed his 
determination, however, to render all possible assistance in enforcing the law, notwith- 
standing a number of defects which were pointed out. 
The law after four years’ trial.—In 1878 Superintendent Gilmour called upon the city 
superintendents of schools for special reports, showing what had been accomplished 
under the compulsory law. ‘‘ These reports,’ he says, ‘‘show that no practical results 
have been secured. With the exception of two or three cities no steps have been taken 
to the carrying out of the provisions of this law; and where steps have been taken 
hardly any satisfactory results have been secured. The manner in which this law has 
been received by the public is in marked contrast with the law in reference to industrial 
drawing. The act in reference to compulsory education is practically a dead letter, and 
it must be materially amended before it can be enforced. 
“Statistics in reference to this law have also been required * * * from local offi- 
cers in tne rural districts. * * * The reports generally indicate that the law in its 
present form is not and can not be enforced.’’ 
Why not enforced in cities; what the reports say.—Albany: No direct steps taken; no 
compulsion necessary; educational advantages are appreciated so highly that the board 
is embarrassed only in providing sufficient school-room to supply the demand. 
Elmira: The school board has done all it can, but the city authorities refuse to make 
necessary appropriation. Lawyers think the law a cumbrous, awkward thing to exe- 
cute. A reform school or ungraded school for irregular attendants greatly needed. 
Poughkeepsie: Substantially nothing done. Only a small number of the children 
coming under the provisions of the law are not in school. 
Brooklyn: In 1876 five attendance agents and a superintendent of attendance of high 
character were appointed under rules of the city board of education. These agents 
notified the proprietors of all the large manufactories of the terms of the law with the 
following results: (1) Large numbers of juvenile employés were thereupon discharged, 
and the streets were filled with children ‘‘ whose precocious sazacity was constantly ex- 
ercised to elude the vigilance of the agents.’’ (2) Many of the children were members 
of families in which the rigid exclusion from work ‘‘of every member below the age of 
fourteen was a verdict of death by starvation or subsistence by charity.’’ (3) ‘‘ A third 
result of enforced attendance of unwilling pupils upon our public schools was more im- 
portant in its effect on the discipline, morals, and efficiency of instruction in them than 
had been anticipated, and unhappily that result was the reverse of beneficial. * * * 
The effect of their forced obtrusion upon many of the classes was not less disastrous to

_ the discipline and morals of the pupils in them than to the equanimity and efficiency of 
the instructor. In consequence of their long neglect of the subjects of study it was 
found necessary to place these unfortunate youths in thesame classes with pupils scarcely 
more than one-half their age to whom the contagion of their vices was doubly infectious 
from the influence of their superior strength and greater years,’’ etc, 
“Tt was such evils as ahs which affected the judgments of the members of this board 
in establishing some mode of accomplishing the designs of the law without the attendant 
evils of its late enforcement.”” 
From September, 1876, to July, 1878, the attendance agents were employed entirely as 
truant officers, the same as had been the case for 12 years prior to the passage of the 
compulsory aie k _ |. RDUCATION REPORT, 1888 Tae 
In October, 1878, two attendance schools were established for the instruction of children 
of confirmed truant habits. These were designed to relieve the public schools from the 
purden of the discipline of such children and materially increase the efficiency of tuition 
for the more regular attendants upon them. 
The city superintendent, in closing his report, says in general terms with regard to 
the compulsory law: Pe 
“Tts extent of utility, however, ought not to be measured by the number of delin- 
quents whose tendency has subjected them to arrest by the attendance agents, as the 
wholesome fear of such discipline has doubtless deterred many others from committing 
the same offense. ; 
“The modified system adopted by this board during the last year (1878) effected 
nearly all that could be judiciously performed for arresting truancy, and when supple- 
mented by the establishment of special truant schools I believe the act will accomplish 
all that is practicable in compulsory attendance upon the public schools.’’ 
New York; ‘“The compulsory education clauses of the law have been only partially 
enforced. * * * The superintendent of truancy reports that he has found only 303 
children between the ages of 8 and 14 who are employed in stores, factories, etc., of 
_ whom fully one-half are entitled to certificates of attendance. He, however, says: ‘I 
desire to know what course I shall pursue in regard to those who are the children of 
very poor parents, whose wages are of the greatest importance to assist in the support of 
their parents and other members of the family during the rigors of winter. A notice to 
their employers will discharge the whole of them into the street, making a fresh supply 
of recruits for the beggar and pauper class.’ In other words, he reports that the law* 
can not be enforced without such distressing consequences to parents as he shrinks from 
being the means of producing, even though the duties of his office would seem impvra- 
tively to require this to be done. 
‘From all the facts presented it would appear that very little has been accomplished 
this year in the effort: to carry into effect the provisions of the law. But I do not think 
the community, or the school system, has suffered therefrom, as I deem the law in its 
general scope unnecessary and in many respects impracticable.”’ 
Lockport: No e‘fort'made to enforce the provisions of the law, the prospects of suc- 
cess being insufficient to warrant the labor and expense involved. ' 
Syracuse: A census was taken; only a few children, eight to fourteen, were found to 
be non-attendants, so action was deemed unnecessary. The superintendent fears the 
act may have the effect of limiting to fourteen weeks the attendance of many poor chil- 
dren who would have attended longer, and does not feel certain ‘‘that any good can be 
secured to the cause of education by legislation compelling attendance at the public 
schools.’? _ 
Newburg: Nothing done. 
Oswego: Nothing done except to publish the act, . 
Long Island City: Nothing done. i 
Ogdensburg: Nothing done. ‘‘The law is not adapted to the condition of the citizen 
‘and his rights in a free country like ours. School men should have a voice in making 
school law in order to make it practicable.” 
Schenectady: Nothing accomplished. A 
After fourteen years of trial.—State Superintendent A. S. Draper, in his second report, 
dated Talat 17, 1888, stated that the attendance on the schools did not keep pace 
with the growth of the population, and attributed this result to the circumstance that 
nothing practical had ever been done in the State by way of compelling attendance upon 
the school: “To be sure,’’ he says, ‘‘we have a compulsory education law upon our 
statute books, but.it isa compulsory law which does not compel. It has never been 
acted under to any considerable extent, and this being so after fourteeu years of trial, 
it is fair to presume that it never will be.! In my opinion there are good reasons why 
1Jn writing to the Bureau under date of January 27, 1890, Superintendent Draper says of the 
statute of 1874: “‘It has never been operated effectually, unleas in two or three large cities, where 
the bircumstanees were extreme, and where they have facilities through other legislation for 
utilizing some of its provisions.” 
 
-P-A-G-E-569
   
  COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE—NEW YORE, 497 4 
it has never accomplished what was desired of it. In the first place it requires members 
of boards of education to look after and apprehend delinquent children, and it is un- 
reasonable to expect that officials elected only to manage the schools and who serve 
without pay will devote the necessary time or that they will engage in work which 
should devolve upon a policeman or constable or some other officer specially charged 
with and paid for such service. Again, the penalties provided in the act run mainly 
against children, and no people will be swift to enforce penalties against children for 
delinquency not amounting to crime, for which they are not so properly answerable as 
are their parents or guardians, ‘The penalties in the act which go against parents are 
mere fines, so inconsiderable as to be ridicalous, and the machinery provided for collect- 
ing them is too cumbersome and expensive to be commonly made use of. Moreover the 
act requires that children under fourteen years of age should attend for at least fourteen 
weeks in the year. Attendance for so small a part of the year is hardly of enough im- 
portance to justify any serious effort to insure it. Again, the law does not require 
communities to act in the matter, nor does it provide any adequate school facilities for 
the accommodation of delinquents if brought in.”’ 
The present laa insufficient.—In another connection Superintendent Draper says of the 
statute of 1874: ‘‘ nis measure, now known as chapter. 421 of the laws of 1874, was 
materially amended in 1876, and constitutes the present compulsory-education law of 
this State. It has never availed much. In the light of experience we ave able to see 
that its theories were not alto; 
its remedies were inadequate, and that, above all, it made no suitable provision for its 
own enforcement. * * * Only in two or three larger cities where circumstances 
have been extreme, where local officers have been interested and possessed of back-bone, 
and where, in consequence of other legislation, they have had ‘authority and means to 
enforce some of the provisions of this statute, have any results worth mentioning flowed 
from it. Yet these two or three large cities serve an excellent purpose in pointing out 
the course necessary to be pursued in order to be successful in gathering the children of 
indifferent and dissolute parents into the schools.’’ 
Principles to be embodied in any effective statute.—‘ There is no longer any necessity for 
moving blindly in the matter. The State can now act more intelligently than it did in    
1874, and effectually meet the difficulty if it undertakes to do so. Public experience, — 
at home and abroad, since that time, has been such as-to point out clearly the particu- 
Jar steps which need to be taken to make certain of general suecess in the undertaking. 
* * * JT think that experience has shown that any statute which will be effective 
must at least embody the following principles: 
‘1, The law must specify the ages between which and months of the year within 
which all children must be insome school, either public or private, of suitable character, 
unless excused therefrom for sufficient reasous by official authority. 
‘¢2, Parents and guardians must be made responsible for sending children to school, 
and must be punished sufficiently to insure compliance with the requirements of the 
statute. : 
“3, Special institutions must be provided for thoroughly vicious and incorrigible 
cases which can not safely be received into the ordinary schools. 
‘4, The law must set up the machinery for securing and keeping continuously a per- 
fect census of children of school age in each city or district, and it must provide and 
pay officers to look up and account for each child, and to execute all the provisions of 
the statute. 4 
“Whiie the friends of popular education will be justified in vigorously seeking the 
enactment of a measure which does something more than toy with this important sub- 
ject, and in refusing to.accept any measure which does not give promise of operating 
effectually, it is to he hoped that no controversy will be permitted over nonessential 
details. There isno room for any serious differences as to details among people who 
admit the principle that the State should see to it that children within specified ages 
should be sent to a suitable school, and who are either experienced themselves or are 
familiar with the experience of others in trying to enforce this principle. It seems to 
me that, at this late day, the opinions of people who deny this principle are entitled to 
but little consideration, and thata principle so important, both toindividual and public 
interests, should not. be jeopardized through the lack of aquaintance with what may 
be necessary to enforce it.’’ 4 
Action of the council of superintendents.—Certain occurrences in 1887 had aroused pub- 
lie attention in the matter of school attendance, and the State council of city and village 
puppH dhenden ey which met in November of that year, adopted the following resolu-

“That the weakness of the Jaw lies in its failure to fi specific obligations for its en- 
forcement with suflicient certainty to secure individual esponsibility therefor. 
“That the important need is some place of detention free from semblance of a penal 
institution for the temporary detention of delinquents under the law. Industrial schools 
under State or local authority should be established in sufficient numbers to meet this 
requirement of the law. mas t 
“That every commanity should be rigidly required to furnish sufficient school accom-. 
modations for the entire school population. 1 Bi ih 
“That, the Jaw, if it does not warrant the appointment of truant officers, should beso 
amended as to provide for such appointments, with a provision for adequate compensa- 
tion for such officers, and such officers should be required in all cities and important 
village com! munities.’? ‘ 
A committee composed of competent and experienced members of the council was ap- 
pointed to draft a general bill covering the whole subject of compulsory education, and 
submit the same to the State superintendent. 
‘A bill embodying the necessary provisions was accordingly drawn up and introduced 
into the assembly in 1883, but failed to pass. The ensuing year it was reintroduced in a 
modified form and passed both houses, put failed to become a law through want of ap- 
proval of the governor. His t 
* The proposed law.—The bill, as it finally came to the governor, contained the follow- 
_ ing provisions:) as j 
J. All children between the ages of seven and eleven years shall attend some school, 
either public or private, or be instructed at home during the entire time in each year 
petween the Ist day of October and the Ist’ day of June that the public schools of the 
city or district in which they reside may be in session, 
2, Children between eleven and fourteen years of age must attend school for at Jeast 
fourteen consecutive weeks in each year; children bebween the ages of eleven and six- 
teen years, when not regularly engaged in some useful employment, must attend school 
_when the public schools are in session. ‘The existing law provides that violations against 
its recat shall be punishable by fines not exceeding sixty-six dollars in any one 
  year, recoverable by civil process. But it happens that the great majority of the vio- 
lators of the law are persons for whom a civil process has no terrors, and hence the law 
may be and is broken with impunity. The proposed law, however, makes violations 
of its provisions a misdemeanor punishable by fine or imprisonment, or both. The 
penalty for the finst convietion is one dollar or one day’s imprisonment, and for each 
subsequent conviction, not exceeding thirteen in any one year, the penalty is five dol- 
Jars or five days’ imprisonment, or both. | If a parent shall make a written statement 
of his inability to induce or compel his child to attend school, then the parent shall 
thereafter, for the period of one year, be relieved from the penalties prescribed in the 
act, and the child shall be deemed and dealt with as an habitual traant, and as such 
shall, upon conviction, be committed to some suitable reformatory institution for juve- 
nile delinquents already existing, or to the one for the establishment of which the bill 
provides in subsequent sections. Requisite machinery is provided for carrying the law 
jnto effect, In rural districts the trustees are charged with its execution, and consta- 
ples are required to aid therein by notifying parents, making arrests under the law, and 
placing nonattendant and truant children in school. In cities and villages boards of 
education are charged with this duty, and are required to appoint attendance officers 
and to see that the law is faithfully ‘and properly enforced. Failure so to do is made 
punishable by withholding from the delinquent district or city its share of the public 
"money until such time as the law is complied with, Cities of two hundred and fifty 
- thousand inhabitants or over must within five years, and all other places must within 
two years, provide adequate and suitable accommodations for all children of school . 
age Hemi within their respective limits who may desire or be required to attend 
school. Failure to comply with this provision will work a withholding of the public 
money as above, | 
‘Ifa parent should prefer to place his child in a private or parochial school rather 
than in a public school he may do so, subject to the requirement that it shall be a 
schoo} in which at Jeast the elementary branches of reading, spelling, writing, arith- 
metic, grammar, and geography are taught in the English language. ‘The design evi- 
dently is that all our youth should be’ instructed in the national tongue; that aliens 
shall not be permitted to perpetuate foreign prejudices and foreign habits of thought in 
their big through clinging to the use of a foreign language.’ If the instruction is 
to be given at home it must be by a teacher duly qualified to teach under the laws of 
" the State or approved by a school commissioner or a city superintendent of schools. 
“The final sections of the bill provide for the establishment of a State school for in- 
  
This summary of the essential features of the bill is taken’ from a paper by Superintendent E, 
N. Jones, of Saratoga Springs. i

eorrigible children to which truants convicted under the act may be committed. No 
person convicted or accused of a crime or misdemeanor not described in the act shall 
be committed to this school, the purpose being to avoid giving to it, so far as possible, 
a penal character, so that those who have been discharged therefrom shall carry with 
them as little of stigma and disgrace as may be. The authorities of this institution are 
required to report to the State sup:rintendent of public instruction annually such facts 
as he may require relating to the conduct and management thereof.’’ 
The bill originally contained a clause requiring all teachers of private schools to sub- 
mit to the same examination as do teachers of the public schools. This was stricken 
out in its passage through the legislature, since ‘‘in order to get the bill before the ex- 
ecutive the parochial schools must be eonciliated,’’ says Superintendent Jones, ‘'They- 
must be satisfied that the terms of the bill would not be an infringement upon their 
educational plans.’’ 
Objections of the governor.—Governor Hill, without. passing judgment on the general 
intent and purpose of the measure, found some provisions in it that led him to think 
that the interests of the public would be better subserved by postponing the bill for 
revision by the next legislature. His most serious objections were made against the 
proposed State school for incorrigible children as being an institution of an essentially 
criminal character and not adapted to the purpose for which it was intended. Hesug- 
gested that the proper provision for truant schools might better be made by the local 
authorities than by, the State at large. The bill accordingly failed to become a law. 
The compulsory law enforced in the city of New York—-significan police statistics. —Supt. 
John Jasper, of the New York city schools, reports as follows (1889-90): 
“The city of New York is fortunate in thé possession of an efficiently organized tru- 
ancy department, with a corps of twelve agents. For this reason the compulsory-edu- 
cation act is not, as is asserted of many other places. a dead ietter. 
“The records of the department show that the total number of visits made by the 
agents to homes, schools, stores, ete., was 34,105; that the total number of cases fully 
investigated and closed was 16,526, and that the whole number of cases of truants 
‘found and returned to school was 3,590. In the reports of truants the same child may” 
be given more than once; the actual number of different truants averages, year by 
year, about half the whole number of cases reported. The number of nonattendants 
found and placed in school was 1,254. 
‘“ The beneficial effects of the enforcement of this law are shown most clearly by the 
police statistics, from which can be seen the remarkable decrease in the arrests of ju- 
venile offenders, notwithstanding the very large increase in population during the last 
twenty years. : i 
“If the law could be soamended that all unemployed children of school age found 
loitering in the streets or other public places, should be obliged to attend school, a fur- 
ther improvement would be eftected. ' 
“To throw the clearest light possible on thissubject and to furnish an ‘object lesson’? 
that may encourage other localities to a systematic enforcement of the truancy law, I 
submit the following table:

      COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE—~RILODE ISLAND. 
RHODE ISLAND. 
School attendance was not required of all children by Jaw in Rhode Island until 
1883, though for nearly thirty years previous provisions relative to the employment of 
school children, and authorizing the enactment of local ordinances for the suppression 
of truancy, and the appointment of officers for the special duties appertaining to these 
matters, had been borne upon the statute books. These provisions, however, had been 
entirely inoperative, for various reasons.* f 
A study of the results of the census of 1880 revealed to the people of Rhode Island 
the fact that that State had the largest proportion of illiterates above ten years of age 1x 
of any State in the North, there being 11.2 per cent. in Rhode Island, against an aver- 
age of 5.9 per cent. for ali the other Northern States. Being placed between two States 
where the laws compelled employers and parents to educate the children, Rhode Island 
served ak an open and inviting field for parents who sought to escape these conditions, 
and thus attracted an illiterate foreign element. A full knowledge of the magnitude 
of this evil quickly led to efforts to counteract it. ‘‘Already different localities have 
begun to move in the matter,’’ wrote State Supt. Thomas B. Stockwellin 1882, ‘tand seek ~ \ 
for means of self-protection, so far as they can be provided under existing laws. The 
city of Newport has already passed a truant ordinance, and several of the towns are _ 
considering the question. The public sentiment of the State is rapidly changing in ne 
reference to such legislation.” ‘ 5 
‘This movement culminated in the passage of the compulsory-attendance law of 1883, . 
in which were incorporated also provisions relating to the employment of school chil- 
dren and truancy. ‘This law was revised in 1887, the principal changes being, (1) the 
imposition of a penalty upon cities and towns for noncompliance (section 15), (2) the 
giving of jurisdiction to the district courts of the State instead of to the justice courts of 
the towns, and (3) the extension of the field of forbidden labor to mercantile estab- 
lishments and telegraph and telephone companies. The law of 1887 accordingly reads 
as follows: e

already acquired the elementary branches of learning taught in the public schools, or if his physi- cal or mental condition was such as to render such attendance inexpedientor impracticable, orhas been excused by the school committee of the town in which such child resides, then such penalty t 
shall not be incurred, Src. 2.

Digi 9. [Repealing clause.]      Under the old law.—Before the introduction (in 1887) of the penalty clause of section 
15, cities and towns were only liable to be “reported”? annually by the local school 
committees to the State Board for noncompliance with the law, so that it was virtually 
a local-option law; yet even under those circumstances a truant ordinance had been’ 
enacted in every town and at least one truant officer appointed. The machinery for 
carrying the law into effect therefore existed before the passage of the revised law. But 
jn some places it wasalmost, if not quite, worthless, for the lack of any suitable provision’ 
for the compensation ofthe truantofficer.! ‘Theenforcement of the law had also to give 
way hereand there to political exigencies. In Providence it was ignored. The real reason, 
however, for its not being completely enforced throughout the State was summed up by 
the State superintendent jn one word—indifference. The people had not become suffi- 
ciently aroused. } | 
Under the law of 1887.—The new law (of 1887) differs from that of 1883 only as pre- 
viously noted. It is being enforced with increasing rigor, principally as the result of 
the development of a more healthy public sentiment inits favor. The statistics of its 
enforcement, as gathered by Superintendent Stockwell, ‘‘are very encouraging, not be- 
cause they show a perfect attendance, or one that we should be satisfied with, but 
because they reveal a steady and general movement toward the attainment of that end. 
This is the best kind of evidence that the principles of the compulsory law are being 
evs

more and more fully recognized, their logical deductions accepted, and the necessary 
efforts made to carry them out. * * * 
_“* While the law is enforced in very different degrees in different localities, still it is 
coming to be a recognized factor in nearly every town, There are but six towns that 
do not report some work done under the law, and in most of those towns it is probable 
that there was really no occasion for the services of a truant officer. In the rural see- 
tions of the State there is seldom any demand for its interference; the fact that there is 
such an officer, ready to act if the necessity arises, is usually all the force required, | 
“** Attention is particularly called to the very small number of convictions of truants 
reported. While a great many cases of truancy are reported as having been investigated, 
it has been found necessary, in order to secure attendance of the great body of these 
truants, to send to the reform school but eleven. This shows what has always been 
claimed, that the great mass of truants would at once yield to.the orders of the truant’ 
officers rather than take a term at the reform school; that, practically, only the hard- 
ened offenders against not only the school laws but other laws also would need such 
treatment.’?! # 
And in writing to the Bureau Superintendent Stockwell says (January 27, 1890): 
“Our experience shows that locality does not make so much difference in the matter of 
enforcement as the disposition or interest of the authorities. Providence has so far been 
a conspicuous illustration of ‘how not to do it,’ while the other cities have done excel- 
lent work. Pawtucket, with a school population of 5,285, brought into her schools 
during the year every child who was amenable to the law, or was not exempt under its 
provisions, i 
“ Some of the country towns have made very thorough work, while others have done 
very little. Of course there is much less demand for such a law in the country, so far 
as quantity is concerned, but there are cases which need it fully as much as any in the 
citie: ‘ > 
‘‘With us the enforcement is a matter of growth. Each year shows an advance in 
popular sentiment and an improvement in attendance.’’ 
A more centralized system desired.—The State Board of Education, in the follow- 
ing recommendation, look to the adoption of something resembling the Connecticut 
system: ‘‘ We think that it would be conducive to a better enforcement of the truant 
law if the truant officers could be appointed by the State Board of Education or by 
some central authority. By the present law the officers are restricted in the honest 
discharge of their duties. Appointed by the party in power, they have a strong ineli- 
nation to serve their friends and cater to their interests. In many towns their com- 
pensation is not enough to support them.’’? 
  KANSAS. 
The Kansas legislature passed a compulsory attendance law in 1874, which was al- 
most a literal transcript of the noted, Michigan law of 1871, and. which has come down 
to the present time unaltered, save in the addition of a provision two years later (1876) 
relating to malicious prosecution, which forms section 106. The law is as follows: 
Kansas Law—1874. i. 
Sxc. 103. Children shall attend school.—That every parent, guardian, or other person in the State of Kansas, having control of any child or children between the ages of eight and fourteen years, shall be required to send such child or children to a public school or private school, taught by a compe- tent instructor, for a period of at least twelve weeks in each year, six weeks of which time shall be consecutive, unless such child or children are excused from Such’ attendance by the board of the school district, or the board of education of the city in which such parent, guardian, or person hay- ing control resides, upon its being shown to their satisfaction that such parent or guardian was not able by reason of poverty to clothe such child properly; or that such child’s bodily of mental eon- dition has been such as to prevent his attendance at school or application to study for the period required; or that such child or children are taught at home in such branches as are usually taught in the public schools, subject to the same examination as other pupils of the district or city in which the child resides; or that he has already acquired the ordinary branches required by law; or that there is no school taught within two miles by the nearest traveled road, : Spo. 104, Penalty for violation of this act.—Any parent, guardian, or other person failing to comply with the provisions of this act shall upon conviction’ be deemed guilty of 4 misdemeanor, and fined in a sum not Jess than five nor more than ten dollars for the first offense, nor less than ten nor more than twenty for the second and every subsequent offense. Said action shall be prosecuted in the name of the State of Kansas before any court of competent jurisdiction; and all fines so col- lected shall be paid into the county treasury for the support of common schools, SEC. 105.

The only State superintendent who has referred to this law in his report, previous to 
1890, is the Hon. John Fraser, who in 1876 called upon county superintendents to re- 
port upon the operation of it in their respective counties. In response forty-four replies 
were received, 70 per cent. of which reported the law either as “inoperative,’? ‘‘ deti- 
cient,’? or a ‘dead letter,” while 30 per cent. report it as having had so far some effect 
in increasing attendance. : ri 
The principal and almost the only reason given for non-enforcement related to the 
means provided forsecuringa prosecution: ‘‘ No one wishes to inform on his neighbor.’’ 
* Individuals are not sufficiently interested in their neighbors’ affairs to be willing to 
incur their displeasure by complaining of them.’? ‘©There are few persons, compara- 
tively, that possess sufficient educational enthusiasm to ineur a neighbor’s displeasure 
py attempting the enforcement of the law.”’ 
Subsequent to 1876 the law ceases to bementioned in the State school reports, as already, 
_ stated. In response to an inquiry by this Bureau, the newly-appointed State superin- 
| tendent, Hon. Geo. W. Winans, says (January 28, 1890): ‘‘As’ there are so many ways 
in which the law may be eyaded, I can not say that it has so far been any great suc- 
cess.??

[ ILLINOIS. 
The law of 1893.—Compulsory education legislation in Illinois dates from 1883, The 
law approved June 23 of that year required all persons haying control of children be- 
tween the ages of eight and fourteen years to send them toa private or public school not 
Jess than twelve weeks in each school year, unless such children were excused from at- 
tending school by the local school board. It was provided that a child might be excused 
(1) on account of unsuitable mental or bodily condition; (2) if he had been taught in a 
private school of at home in such branches as are ordinarily taught in primary or other 
he had already acquired the branches of learning ordinarily taught in © 
schools; (3) if 
public schools, or (4) if no school had been taught within two miles of his residence 
‘during the school year. { 
Persons haying control of children and not complying with the law were subject to a 
fine of from five to twenty dollars. Members of school boards were required to bring 
suit within twenty days after service of notice by any taxpayer that the Jaw had been 
violated, and were mace liable to be sued by any taxpayer and fined ten dollars if they 
neglected to do so, 
The law « failure —This law failed to accomplish the purpose for which it was enacted. 
\. Hon. Richard Edwards, the State superintendent, writes to the Bureau regarding it: 
“Tts phraseology was such as to make it easy of evasion. That law appeared to pro- 
duce absolutely no effect. ,It may be said that the people gave it no attention.’? And 
elsewhere he says: ‘‘It is doubtful whether this law has caused an increase in the 
attendance upon our schools of one hundred pupils.” 
The law now in foree—In 1889 a new law was enacted, and a more stringent one, es: 
pecially in its provisions concerning the instruction that may be considered equivalent : 
to public-school instruction. This law (the ‘‘ Force act’’) reads as follows:   
, AN ACT concerning the education of children, 
ed by the people of the State of Illinois, represented in the general assembly: That every

Sro. 6, “An act to secure to all children the benefit of an elementary education,” approved June 23, 1888, in force July l, 1883, is hereby repealed, Approved May 24, 1889, 
     
       
Concerning this law Superintendent Edwards writes (January 27, 1890): ‘‘I do not 
regard the act as in all respects perfect, but it is found in practice to have many excel- 
lent points. There has been some opposition to it among the friends of parochial 
schools, especially those in which some foreign language is the vehicle of communica- 
tion. Some of them propose that iastead of requiring the specified subjects, reading, 
writing, arithmetic, history of the United States, and geography, to be taught in the 
English language, it be required that English shall be taught to every pupil during two 
er three hours each day. The whole subject is under consideration by the friends of 
the law, and it is impossible now to tell what the result will be. © 
“But the law has already accomplished very great good. In the city of Chicago 
thousands of children haye been brought into the schools through its agency. The 
same thing is also true in other towns and cities of the State. The educational senti- 
ment of the State required the passage of some such law, and there has been a praise- 
worthy effort to execute it thoroughly but humanely. Complaints have come from two 
or three places of harshness on the part of school authorities. But these complaints 
have in some instances been exaggerated. . 
‘From the great majority of towns and school districts, however, the testimony is 
that the law is working admirably, and that it is not used for any purpose of persecu- 
tion. 
“One excellent result of the enacting of this law has been the very general discussion 
of the subject of compulsory education. * * * It has been everywhere thoroughly, 
discussed, and the indications are that throughout this State its friends are very largely 
in the majority.’’ é ‘ 
Superintendent Edwards further says in his report! that the compulsory school bill 
was brought forward by the consent of men of all parties; it passed the senate unani- 
mously and in the house only six votes were recorded against it. ‘‘It is preposterous,’’ 
he says, ‘‘to claim that the legislature should, with such unanimity, enact a measure 
intended to infringe upon the liberties of any reputable class of citizens, ‘The claim 
that this law doesso was an afterthought. 
“Phe compulsory education law isright in principle. The State taxes the citizen for 
the support of the public schools because univerSal education is necessary to the preser- 
vation of the State and of the institutions of civilization. This tax every property 
holder is compelied to pay. He has no choice. Now, if the State has this right to take 
by authority the citizen’s property, has not the citizen the right to demand that the 
purpose for which this property is taken shall be carried out? And that purpose is the 
education of all the children in the State. It is, therefore, the imperative duty of the 
State to do all it can to enforce the accomplishing of this purpose. ‘To fail in this would 
be, on the part of the State, an exercise of bad faith toward its tax-paying citizens. 
‘The present compulsory education law does not interfere with the rights of parents 
or with individual liberty any more than any other wholesome law. If a parentshould 
beat his child unreasonably, or should starve him, or should otherwise maltreat ‘him, 
the law steps in to protect the child. But to deprive a child of education, to cripple 
him for life by a lack of knowledge and of proper schooling, is a worse outrage than any 
of these, because it injures the child in his noblest attributes, disables him where he

ought to be strongest and best. The compulsory educational law is no more tyrannical 
than the law prohibiting teachers and school officers from dealing in. school books, or 
the law requiring teachers to pass an examination and hold certificates. ‘ 
‘Much misapprehension arises from a failure to note the thing aimed at in this com- 
pulsory law. If the law provided that children should be compelled to learn certain dog- 
mas, to accept certain beliefs, whether in religion or politics or social science, it might be - 
reasonably objected to as restricting the liberty of the individual. But the compulsion 
js not of this nature. The compulsory education law merely compels the recognition 
of the rights of children to an amount of intelligence that will enable them to make use- 
ful and successful citizens, to secure their own happiness and to do good in the world. 
The compulsion that dictates the belief of a man is a trammel upon his mental freedom; 
put the compulsion that prevents one human being from keeping another human being 
in ignorance, really promotesan enlargement of individual liberty. If the present com- 
pulsory education. law is executed in a right spirit, the amount of individual freedom 
jn the State of Illinois will be immensely enlarged by’ its agency. i eh 
“Education protects those who profit by it against the greed of selfish power and also 
against the cajolery of thedemagogue. The object of the compulsory education law is to 
enlarge in this State the number of persons whoare really self-directive, who are really 
masters of themselves and of their circumstances—who do not derive their opinions from 
cliques and parties, but from {heir own thinking. To say that it is an interference with 
the freedom of the citizen, therefore, is emphatically to misrepresent it. PE 
“The compulsory education law does not necessarily interfere with the parochial or 
other private schools. In the enactment of it there was no intention of such interfer- 
ence. Itspecially provides that attendance at such schools shall be accepted in lieu of 
attendance upon the public schools. Tt was decided by the circuit court in Effingham 
County that the act of such attendance, where it could be proved, must be accepted by 
the board of directors. In other words, the authority conferred by the law upon the 
poard of directors does not empower them to ignore the facts in the case, and of their 
own mere whim to refuse to recognize a private school. This is in exact agreement with 
the intention of the friends of the law at the time of its enactment. And the statistics 
of the year show, conclusively, that no such injury to private schools has resulted from 
the execution of the law. On the contrary, it seems to have helped them. oF PE 
- “Tn general, we find that the results of the enactment of this law have been in all re- 
spects excellent. In the city of Chicago during the last year, some 10,000 children have 
been brought into the schools by means of it, and of these 1,500 have been placed in 
parochial schools. Taking the statistics of the public schools in the entire State, we 
have 4 gain in the enrollment for the year ending June, 1890, over the preceding year   
of 16,454, ‘The increase in the enrollment of pupils in the public schools during the 
last year is 20 per cent. of all the increase during the last ten years. That is, the in- 
is just double the average increase. Considering the character 
crease for the last year i 
of the last winter, the muddy roads, and the prevalence of epidemics, this is a remarka- 
ple showing. 
“The number of cases in which the penalty has been inflicted is exceedingly small. 
In this State there were, in 1888, 11,532 school districts. It may reasonably be sub- 
mitted that the proportionate number of prosecations is much ‘smaller than it would be 
found to be in the execution of almost any other law. In thecity of Chicago not asingle 
suit has been brought. The same is true of the city of Springfield and of other cities. 
The instructions that have been given from this office have urged the avoidance, as far 
as possible, of the inflicting of penalties. Officers have been advised to explain the law 
to those who had been negligent of their duty, and thus by friendly appeals to induce 
them to deal justly by their children, In almost every instance such appeals have been 
successful, And if captious opposition to the law should cease and persons of humane 
feelings and good sense should be appointed as truant officers, an immense amount of 
good might be done in the State with substantially no friction at all.” 
Amendments proposed to the Illinois law _—It will be useful to note that the State super- 
intendent has recommended to omit the requirement that each child should attend school 
in the city, town, or district in which he resides; also to consider any private school ‘in 
which the branches of learning required by this law are taught”? as equivalent to a pub- 
lic school, instead of merely providing that such private school should be approved by 
the public school board.’

WISCONSIN. 
Law of 1879.—This law, which took effect September 1, 1879, was the initial step in 
the direction of compulsory education in Wisconsin. As amended in 1882, it required 
persons having control of children between seven and fifteen years of age to send them 
to a public or private school at least twelve weeks each year. Any child might be ex- 
empted from attending, (1) if incapacitated in mind or body, as shown by physician’s cer- 
tificate; (2) if his time or labor were essential to the support of an indigent parent, brother, 
or sister; (3) if he were otherwise being furnished with the means of education for a — 
like period of time; or (4) had already acquired a fair knowledge of the branches of learn- 
ing ordinarily taught in the common schools; or (5) resided more than two miles from . 
the public school of his district: . 
School boards were to meet annually, on the first Monday of September, to hear rea- 
sons for the nonattendance of children at the public schools: a list was to be made of all 
children residing in the district who had not attended school during the preceding year, 
and a note opposite the name of each child on such list was to indicate whether the child 
was exempt from uttendance, and, if so, for what cause. 
Persons haying control of children and failing to comply with the terms of the law 
were subject to a fine of from five to thirty dollars, to be collected by the director or 
president of the school board, and if such officer, on notice of violation of law served 
by any qualified elector or taxpayer, failed to prosecute the offender, he himself be- 
came liable to a fine of from ten to twenty dollars, in anaction instituted by any person 
feeling aggrieved. ‘ 
Immediate effect of the law.—The succeeding year witnessed a considerable increase in 
publi¢ school attendance. ‘‘ Undeniably,’’ says the State superintendent in 1880, ‘‘ this 
result is chiefly due to the operation of the compulsory education law. * * * Itis 
true that all portions of the State have not regarded the law with equal favor; and it 
can not be questioned but that many sections have utterly neglected to secure the bene- 
fits which the law is intended to provide. But it is very evident that, ‘by the efforts of 
some county superintendents, teachers, and school boards, the measure has been rendered 
quite effective in several localities. It will be found that the duty imposed upon the 
director of any school distrieé or the president of the board of education ‘to prosecute of- 
fenses under this law’ does not meet all the necessities of the case, These officers.are 
inclined, from the nature of their positions, to avoid or neglect such prosecutions, The 
qualified electors or taxpayers in a district shrink from complaining before these officers 
of the neglect of their neighbors in requiring the children to attend school the specified 
time each year. We shall \e compelled to follow the example of other communities, 
* * * and provide for the appointment of a police force, or special agents.’’ 
Its subsequent failure.—In the years succeeding 1880 no action worthy of note appears 
to have been taken under the lawof 1879. Whatever good it had done at first had been 
chiefly in an indirect or motal way under the stimulus of a general discussion of the 
subject, rather than to any summary proceedings taken. Would-be transgressors were re- 
strained from violating the law through the mere apprehension of being subjected to its 
penalties, As the law, however, was not invoked against offenders, they soon ceased to 
regulate their conduct with reference toit. State Superintendent Graham said, in 1886, 
** But little attention is paid to the law so far as I have discovered. The little use that 
is made of it, however, is to make it the occasion of annoyance of school officers or of 
persons against whom there is prejudice or animosity. If the law is to remain, school 
officers should be relieved of the duty of commencing actions upon the written notice of ; 
any voter or taxpayer in the district that some person has violated the law, under lia- 
bility of fine for failure to prosecute. There does not appear to be good reason why the 
aggrieved voter or taxpayer should not make his complaint directly to the magistrate, 
as in other cases of violation of statutes.’’ And acounty superintendent remarked, 1888, 
«Since the time that the public school law has authorized any legal voter of the district 
to prosecute offenses against said law, no attempt has been made to enforce the same.”’ 
47 he law of 1889, known as the ‘Bennett law.’’—In order to make more effective provision 
for the elementary education of all children, the Legislature of 1889 enacted what is 
known as the ‘‘ Bennett law,’’ the text of which is here presented. ‘‘Although there 
may be some question whether this act entirely repeals the law of 1879, it is generally 
understood that such is the effect of the enactment of this law.’’ 
AN ACT concerning the education and employment of children. 
The people of the State of Wisconsin, represented in Senate and Assembly, do enact as follows: Every " parent or other person having under his control a child between the ages of seven and fourteen 
years, shall annually cause such child to attend some publicor private day school in the city, town,

Hon. J. B. Thayer, the present State superintendent, in October, 1889, sent to the 
various city and county superintendents an inquiry as to extent to which the Bennett 
law was being enforced. The replies, he notifies the Bureau, ‘‘indicated that boards of _ 
education in cities had, at that date, generally complied with the provisions of the law, 
and that school boardsin rural districts had generally neglected to act. 
“(4 very pronounced opposition to the law,’’ he continues, ‘‘ has been manifested by 
certain religious denominations interested in the maintenance of private or parochial 
schools, in which instruction is given in a foreign languageonly. A portion of the Ger- 
man press of the State is making a vigorous opposition to the law, and is demanding of 
the next legislature its repeal. * * * The newspapers of the State, in general, 
have taken a very lively interest in the discussion of this statute, and it is attracting 
very general public attention.”” 5 
Superintendent Thayer's circular.—In January, 1890, State Superintendent Thayer 
issued to school boards the following circular, explaining the provisions of the Bennett 
law, and defining clearly the right of the State under that law regarding the education 
of its children: 
“The lirst duty imposed upon school boards by this law is that of determining, by 
formal action at a regularly convened meeting of the board, by the adoption of a rule 
or resolution, the number of weeks which every child between the ages of seven and 
fourteen years shall attend some public or private school during the eurrent/school year. 
‘This period can not be fixed at less than twelve, nor more than twenty-four weeks 
in one year. Fora portion or for portions of the time thus fixed the attendance must, 
be consecutive, and boards are to designate in the resolution or rule adopted the time 
or times of such consecutive attendance. Ten days prior to the commencement of this 
time or these times of consecutive attendance, the board is required to give public 
notice of the time thus fixed by publishing the fact in such manner as they may pre- * o / seribe. * * 
‘*The provision that the compulsory period and the number of weeks of consecutive 
attendance shall be fixed prior to the first day of September in each year, is directory 
only. Where the board has neglected to fix this number of weeks, as the law directs, 
that may still be done, provided the public school will be in session a sufficient number 
of weeks before the close of the school year to render such action by the board practica- 
ble. It is hoped that no board will neglect or refuse compliance with the law in this 
respect. 
a The second duty imposed upon school boards by this act is that of carefully consider- 
ing the excuses, on the part of parents and guardians, for real or apparent. noncompli- 
ance with the law. | The law does not presume that every parentor guardian can or will 
avail himself of fhe public school as a means of education for his children or wards, and 
it therefore wisely and judiciously recognizes the right of choice in means, and the 
rigorous exactions of necessity, growing out of conditions either of parent and guardian, 
or of the child of the prescribed age. The excuses for noncompliance which must’ be 
accepted by the board are four in number, and briefly stated are as follows: (a) Pecun- 
iary or physical inability of parent or guardian. (b) Equivalent instrnction, otherwise 
given, intimeandinkind. (c) Proficiency of the child in elementary branches. (d) 
Physical or mental disability of the child. 
“Tt will beobserved that twoof these reasons justifying noncompliance with the law 
relate to the parent or guardian, and two relate to the pupil. Of the latter couplet little 
or nothing need be said. If the facts exist, it will bea simple and easy matter to satisfy 
any reasonable board, that a child has a physical or mental defect which inhibits at- 
tendance upon any school, or that ill health equally calls for exemption from attend- 
anee. s 
‘With persons having no desire to evade the law, or to avoid the natural obligations 
and responsibilities imposed by parental relations, or those arising from the relations 
of a self-imposed trust or legal guardianship, there will also be no difficulty in present- 
ing satisfactory evidence to the board, that the pecuniary situation, or distance from 
the school, or claims of the family upon the services of the child, torm.a valid exense 
for nonattendance, or that the alleged recusant is availing himself or herself of the 
option which the Jaw proffers, and is providing through some other public or private 
school, or other means, equivalent instructions, bothin amount and inkind. In extent, 
the instruction must not be less than that prescribed by the rule adopted by the board. 
In subjects, theinstruction must include reading, writing, arithmetic, and United States 
history, in the English language, as provided in the fifth section of the act in question. 
No school, public or private, and no instruction in the family or by private tutors should

be recognized as sufficient which does not include instruction in these subjects in this a 
form. School or family or other forms of instruction claimed as equivalent may, include 
any other branches of knowledge, and this will be no objection if the enumerated studies, 
. in English, are not omitted. rs * 4 
“By this analysis of the duties of school boards, under this law, it will be readily 
seen that there is no attempt or purpose to ostracize, antagonize, or in any manner or 
degree to interfere with parochial or any other form of private schools. 
“The law has due regard for the rights of conscience, and holds parents alone respon- 
‘sible, and requires of them only that they provide for theirchildren, somehow and some- 
4 where, that secular education which the state deems necessary: for its own prosperity, 
and for the welfare of its citizens. Parents, guardians, and others who may elect otuer 
3 means than the public school of the district in which they reside, for the education of 
a children under their charge or control, when summoned by the school board of their 
district must show sufficient reasons for nonattendance of their children upon the pub- 
Jieschool. In hearing excuses of parents, guardians, and others, boards should act fairly, 
judiciously, and without prejudice, and seelx to secure the codperation of all parents in 
awaking a public sentiment in favor of the end which the law eontem plittes. It must 
be borne in mind that compulsory enactments are supplementary only to the persuasive 
statutes which characterize the great body of laws upon which the school system of 
4 Wisconsin is founded. ‘ 
‘The thing that is antagonized by this law is the practice of allowing children of this 
State of proper school age to pass that period of life without acquiring 2 minimum. of 
education in the elementary branches; without acquiring the ability to think in the 
language of the country, to express themselves intelligibly in that language, orally, in 
writing, and in business forms; and without becoming familiar with the essential fea- 
tures of United States history. To this end, through this statute, the State has invoked 
the active energy of all'school officers to save the future citizens, reared within the Com- 
Ajo? monwealth, from the irreparable loss and disadvantage which will follow neglect or 
cupidity, in depriving children of their rightful heritage. 
“All classes of citizens concede the right of the State to supervise and control the edu- 
cation of children where parents or guardians neglect or refuse to make suitable and 
adequate provision for such education, and to compel attendance of children, and pro- 
vision for such attendance on the part of parents and others having charge of children 
. .. of school age. Nobody justifies that penuriousness or neglect which can only result in 
planting blight, illiteracy, and hopeless disadvantage for all time in the very bud of a 
human life. The degree and the form of compulsion herein exercised by the State is 
infinitesimal when compared with that employed by parental authority to secure ade- 
quate education of children. This law is directed chiefly to those responsible for the 
care and education of children who are devoid of the impulses and instincts of pure 
parental affection, and who disregard wholly the injunctionsand directions of the church 
_and other social and benevolent organizations. ‘To rescue the victims of this thought- 
Jessness, indifference, and cupidity is the main object of this legislation. 
. ‘Incidentally, and in conclusion, it may be said that the provision of this law pre- 
scribing a standard by which to measure @ school, in its claim to be a public school, is 
an admirable feature which should strongly commend it to every sc oo] board. At last 
we have given to us, in statutory form, a statement of the very least which & school 
may do and claim to be a public school suitably and adequately providing for the enn; 
    tion of children and entitled to the advantages of State aid arising from that claim. 
Ought intelligence to be in Engli b 2—Isaac Thomas, in the Yale Review: ‘The tunda- 
mental reason for compulsory educational laws has usually been considered to be to 
protect the State from the evils of illiteracy. Whether they have done so is not now 
the question. ‘This can be done, in part at least, by increasing the intelligence of the 
people. It has usually been thought suflicient, therefore, to frame compulsory jaws 80 
: as to bring about, if possible, this result, But section five, of the Bennett law, says 
the child must not only be intelligent but must have intelligence in English, #. @, he 
, may be never so intelligent, may have good mastery of reading, writing, arithmetic, 
+ and United States history in any other language under the sun, yet if he have not his 
knowledge in English he is liable to the penalties prescribed by this law. Absurdity 
jn Jawmaking couid hardly go farther ! 7 r 
‘With many of our legislators, poth national and State, the panacea for ills in the 
E State, real and imaginary, isa law. No matter about natural forces at work curing 
' these ills as rapidly as ought to be expected in sucha heterogeneous mass as exists in 
the United States, no matter whether the. Jaw ean be enforced or not, nor, if enforced, , 
whether it will help or harm, the cry is for a daw, and a law we get! If this were only 
5 the end of it! But every law passed and not entorced is a degradation of all Jaw and 
® breeds contempt for it, and every attempt to contravene, by law or otherwise, natural 
forces which are working reforms, slowly perhaps, but surely, puts off by just so much 
the day of reform,”’ !

The purpose and seope of the Wisconsin law.—Chieago News: Neither the Bennett 
act of Wisconsin nor the Force act of Illinois, upon which it is based, authorizes the 
State to lay a finger upon a private school or any other private property. They do, 
however, assume that the State has the right to direct the education of the children of 
its citizens so far as elementary instruction is concerned, and they provide that every 
person having control of a child between the ages of 7 and 14 years shall send it to 
a school for a certain number of weeks in every year—i2 weeks in Wisconsin and 16 
in Ilinois—where it shall be taught,'in the English language, reading, writing, arith- 
metic, United States history, and geography. If it can receive this education in a private 
or parochial school, well and good; if not, it must be sent to a public school. Wherein 
is this an attempt on the part of the State to lay hands on the private schools? Wherein 
is it an attempt to say what shall or shall not be taught in them’ The private and 
parochial schools may, if they choose, conduct their lessons in Persian, Chinese, or any 
other language, and they may exclude reading, writing, arithmetic, United States his- 
tory, and geography from their studies. The law does not seek to restrict or compel 
them. And parents may send their children to these schools for 40 weeks in the year 
in Wisconsin or 36 in Illinois. But for 12 weeks in the former State or 16 weeks in the 
latter the little ones must be afforded opportunities to obtain the statutory instruction. 
Does anybody consider this unreasonable? If so, it must be because he denies the 
right of the State to enforce a compulsory-education law of any kind. 
The Lutheran Synod of Missouri, Ohio, and other States, on compulsory education in Wis- 
consin—1, By the law of nature, as well as by divine command, parents are entitled and 
in duty bound to provide for the education of their children. 
2. It is therefore the right and the duty of all parents to select such schools for the 
education of their children as they are convinced will best promote the welfare of their 
ebildren. b 
3. In case parents neglect their duty the State is justified in compelling them, hy ap- 
propriate legislation, to the discharge of their duty. 
4. If, however, the State assumes the right to educate, unless for such cause, it is an 
infringement of the natural rights of parents. - 
5. The conduct of the State in such case is, furthermore, unconstitutional, as the Con- 
stitutions both of the United States and the State of Wisconsin proclaim liberty of con- 
science and ‘religion, which liberty is set aside not only by forcing upon any one that 
which opposes his religion or is in conflict with his conscience, but also when a person 
is hampered in any manner in ‘‘the free exercise of religion’’ and ‘‘rights of conscience,” 
provided he does not act in open violation of law and morality. 
6. In view of the foregoing declarations we are compelled to combat with all lawful 
means in the courts such encroachments, and at the polls to withhold our vote from 
every candidate and party not publicly pledging themselves to do all in their power to 
bring about a repeal of the obnoxious sections of said (Bennett) law. 
7, To avoid all misunderstanding we declare that we consider our public-school system: 
a political necessity, and that we are willing to support it in the futuré as we have in 
the past. We are also convinced that by opposing said school laws, we do not only con- 
tend for our inherent rights, but also best promote the true welfare of our free country. 
We finally declare most emphatically that it has always been and ever shall be our aim 
to provide in our parochial schools for the best instruction in the English language. 
Should be left for the great law of natural selection to adjust.—The School Journal: It is 
very plain that a mistake has been made by the people of Illinois and Wisconsin by 
insisting that the English language only must be taught in all their schools, It it well 
to keep in mind that voters can be easily influenced; but with difficulty driven. For- 
eigners are attached to the language and literature of fatherland, and will insist that 
their children must learn it thoroughly. No one can say that it is not right. In this 
city [New York] several daily papers publish editionsin the German language, because 
there are many who will read no other. It would be foolish to enact a law compell- 
ing these papers to print their issues only in English, for it iscertain that it could not be 
enforced. The common sense of the community would not standit. What we want is 
education in some language, it matters little what. 
The English is to-day, and is to be, the language of America, and if all the Germans 
in the world should come to this country in a body it would not change her predestina- 
tion. For a time in certain States it may seem as though German was taking the coun- 
try, but it is not and never can. Educators should let these minor matters work ont 
their own solution, just as they have in certain parts of Pennsylvania, where for many 
years the ‘‘ Pennsylvania Dutch’’ has been spoken almost to the exclusion of English. 
The Pennsylvanians have been too svise to attempt to compel these people to use nothing 
but English, but in the absence of any law the English is rapidly supplanting the 
mixture, which is neither German nor English. I would be well if no language wag .

spoken in this country but the English, but since this can not be, nothing will be gained 
_ by going to law or the legislature about it. There are some things that must be left 
for the great law of natural selection to adjust, and the use of a foreign tongue in our 
schools is one of them. ‘ i 
Position of the department of superintendence.—The following resolution was adopted by 
the department of superintendence of the National Educational Association at its Phil- 
adelphia meeting (February, 1891). It will he observed that while the necessity of an 
acquaintance with the English language is.upheld that distinguished body did not com- 
mit itself to an approval of the extreme principles of the Wisconsin law: 
In our free Republic the State is merely the expression of the people's will, and not an external 
governmental force; and taxes are levied on property for the support of schools, because universal 
education is indispensable to the perpetuity of the State. Education, therefore, including an ac- 
quaintance with our national language, becomesthe rightful inheritance of every child. It is the 
right and the duty of the State not only to provide for this education, but also to insist thatnochild 
shall be deprived of tat priceless heritage. The proper exercise of thisright does not restrict the 
freedom of parents in the education of their children except in the narrow limits of this necessary 
purpose. % 
Repeal of the Bennett law.—The State legislature, in the spring of 1891, repealed the 
Bennett law by a yery large majority (89 to 14 in the lower house). A new compul- 
sory attendance law, which received the support of both political parties, was soon 
after passed and was approved April 6. In this law the provision that the required 
’ instruction should be in the English language does not appear. 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, { 
A law was enacted by Congress and approved June 25, 1864, of which the following is 
the substance: ‘ f 
Hvery person in the District of Columbia having under his or her control a child between the 
ages of six and fourteen years shall annually send such child to some public school in the part of 
the District in which he or she shall reside at least twelve weeks, six of which shall be consecutive, 
and for every peglen of said duty the offender shall forfeit to the use of that part of the District in 
which he or she shall reside, not exceeding twenty'dollars: Provided, That if the party was not 
able, for any cause, to send such child to school, or the child has attended any other school for a 
like period, or was notiit to attend school by reason of bodily or mental infirmity, the penalty shall 
not be enforeed. The trustees may make such arrangements for the purpose of ascertaining 
whether any children within the above ages are not attending the public schools as they shall deem 
best for the purpose of enforcing their attendance and the penalty preseribed. 
This law has been a dead letter. It was asserted by Mr. W. ©. Dodge in the 
Washington Post (February 21, 1890), that in 1887 the then District Commissioners did 
not know of the existence of such a law; and even if they did, it could not be enforced 
for want of buildings. ‘‘It is not the need of a compulsory law, but of more schools, 
for of course it would be absurd to fine people for not sending their children to school 
‘when there are no schools for them.”’ } i | 
The Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1875 (p. 483) says: “‘ The statute 
has been a dead letter from the date of its enactment to the present hour, as during all 
this time the voluntary attendance has been in excess of the accommodations afforded 
by the schools.’ ; i 
_ “In 1886, 12,089 out of a total enrollment of 32,336 were restricted to one-half day 
attendance for want of school rooms. In 1839, 6,000 children were still limited to halt- 
day schools. ! i 1 ‘ | 
Superintendent W. B. Powell suggests the appointment of truant officers to ascertain 
_ what children do not attend school and why they do not attend, to the end that the 
benefits of the schools may reach all for. whom they are designed. * 
VERMONT. , 
The law requiring all children between eight and fourteen yearsof age to attend school 
was first enacted in 1867; in 1870 it wasamen‘led so as to prescribe more particularly the 
proceedings for enforcing it. This Jaw was said by the late State superintendent, Hon. 
Justus Dartt, to have been ‘‘obsolete and inoperative, and has been so for years, if in- 
deed it was ever effective.’”’* One fatal defect is that it ‘‘ does not designate the person 
to execute it,”’ ii. 
In 1888 the law was remodeled and made much more stringent; among other changes 
the annual obligatory period was extended from twelve to twenty weeks, and illiterate

children under fourteen were made entirely ineligible for employment while the public 
schools were in session, A weak, it may be said a fatally weak, feature of the present 
law is the provision under which the initiation of proceedings is virtually made to de- 
pend upon the complaint of three voters. All experience goes to show that the com- 
plaints of voters or taxpayers have never yet set in motion the machinery for enforcing 
acompulsory law. The following is a summary of the law: 
Every person having control of a child ot good health and sound mind between eight and four- teen yearsof age must send it toa public school at least twenty weeks each year, unless it is other- wise educated for that period or has completed the required branches of the copimon schools. No child between ten and fourteen years of age may be employed in a mill or factory unless it attended a public school twenty weeks during the preceding year and deposited with the owner or superintendent of the mill or factory a certificate to that effect, signed by the teacher, which certificate must be shown to the supervisor of schools, upon his demand, and any other informa- tion given as to the employment of children, After July 1, 1889, no one may employ a child under fourteen who can not read and write, but is capable of such instruction, during the session of its school. Any one not complying with the above regulations forfeits not less thant ten dollars nor more than fifty dollars, one-half to go to the complainant and the other half to the town in which the child resides. Any one having a grand list of over eight dollars, who allows his child to remain from school in violation of the above provisions, becomes liable to the district for assum equal to the amount distributed to such district for the attendance of a pupil for the same period, which amount may be recovered at any time within three years after the close of that svhool year. The truant officer, or a member of the prudential committee, or any officer authorizéd to make arrests in the town, may arrest, and, upon written application of three voters in the district, must arrest, any child not attending school as required, and is to give written notice to the parent or person having control of the child that it mustattend school regularly. If such person then fails to send the child regularly during the remainder of the term, without good reason for the failure, he is to be arrested and taken with the child before a justice, and if convicted is fined not less than sen dollars nor more than twenty dollars, which goes to the benefit of the schools of the town. The prosecution may be conducted like criminal prosecutions, and an appeal may be had to the county court. :. Any person authorized to make the arrests, but who refuses or neglects to do so after application has been made to him as provided. is fined not more than one hundred dollars, A justice of the peace has concurrent jurisdiction with the county court under this section.    
  The report for 1890 of State Superintendent Palmer says (p. 314) that out of 38,000 . 
children between eight and fourteen years of age 2,600 have not attended any school at 
all during the year, and thatof those actually enrolled it is believed a large number failed 
to attend the statutory period of twenty weeks. ‘‘The laws against truancy should 
be repealed or rigidly enforced,” since one of the chief objects of education is to train 
the child into a willing obedience to good laws, and here is a permanent object-lesson 
in law-breaking kept Constantly before the eyes of all the scholars. 
The following amenflments to the school law are recomniended: i 
1. That the district elerk shall furnish the teacherion the first day of the first term o: 
the school year a list all children between five and eighteen in the district, with the 
age of each. 
2. That it shall be the duty of the teacher from time to time, to carefully examine 
the list and notify the truant officer of any violation of the truant laws, 
3. That the sheriff, or constable, or policeman, may act as truant officer. 
4, Thatif the truant officer fails to act the teacher shall notify the supervisor. 
NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
A compulsory education law was passed in 1871,' ot the same general character as the 
Michigan law passed the same year. A trnant law had heen on the statute book for 
about twenty years previous. ; , 
The law relating to compulsory attendance, truancy, and the employment of school 
children to labor, as it stood in 1886, may be summarized as follows: ' 
‘The school boards of the several towns and cities are authorized to elect and fix the compensa- ticn of truant officers whose duty it is to enforce all lawful regulations to require the attendance,at school of truants and children between the ages of six and sixteen not having any regular and law- ful occupation. Any town may make by-laws to compel such children to attend school, and may impose a fine not exceeding ten dollars for each violation thereof. Auy offender against such by- laws may, instead of such fine, be sentenced to the reform school for a term not exceeding one year; but he may give bond to the town in the penal suth of twenty-five dollars that he will faithfully attend school during the next term,and the court may thereupon remit such fine upon payment of the costs. No child under ten years of age? is to be employed by any manufacturing corpora- 
tion; and any agent, superintendent, or overseer, in any corporation, who willfully employs, or 
permits to be employed, any child in violation of this act beco;nes subject to a fine of not less than twenty dollars nor more than one hundred dollars, one-half to go to the complainant and the other half to the county. No child under sixteen is to be employed in any manufacturing establishment unless he has at- tended school at least twelve weeks during the preceding year, and no child under sixteen is to be employed, except in vacation of the school, who can not write legibly and read fluently in readers

No information can be iebbisea that the compulsory clauses of the above law have 
peen enforced. “he state reports of recent years contain scarcely a reference to the mat- 
ter. Superintendent Folsom, of Dover, says: “© have never heard of a case of a suit 
of this kind in this State. * * * Ihave had reason to believe: that there have been, 
and are now, many children jn this city whose parents are liable to the penalties pre- 
scribed by section 15, though no legal complaint has ever been made to me.’” 
’ ‘This has been the uniform experience jn those States where the school authorities 
have been obliged to depend upon information furnished by some taxpayer, or inter- 
ested or aggrieved party, before taking action. 4 t 
With regard to the employment laws, Superintendent Folsom says: ‘‘I find an im- 
pression quite prevalent that these laws are a dead letter with the employers of chil- 
dren in this city, Whether or not this impression is correct, I have no means of know- 
ing officially, as no taxpayer has ever made written complaint, and the law gives no 
authority for an investigat on,”? { 5 
‘The circumstance that numbers of children in Dover and other towns having attended 
school the required time apply for and receive certificates authorizing their employment 
to labor, is suffi¢ient evidence that the law is of some effect, 
It is stated that the Jaw is especially defective in not providing for furnishing school 
authorities with lists of school population, giving age of each child, and in not requir-

MICHIGAN. 
A compulsory eaneation Jaw was enacted in Michigan in 1871, f which the Kansas 
e statute book of that State (see p. 503), and the present laws of 
Jaw of 1874, still on th 
Minnesota, Montana, and in part Colorado, are an almost literalcounterpart. It failed 
for the same reason that the Kansas lavy has failed; #,e., ‘Sit was made every body’s busi- 
ness to see that it was enforced, and consequently it was not enforced at all.’?? This 
law was repealed in the revision of 1881. It was agreat step in advance at the time it 
| made its first appearance, and was widely quoted and discussed as such, 
Tn 1883 a new compulsory attendance law was passed, which, as amended in’ 1885, is 
the one now in operation. Other laws have also been enacted rel ting to employment 
of school children and truancy, the whole forming an inter-related system. It will be 
observed that section 5 of Chapter XX provides no penalty for nonco: pliance with section 
1, which contains the compulsory requirement; and by the repealing of the sections of 
the original law that provided for the appointment of truant officers, ‘‘the duty of insti- 
tuting proceedings to enforce the provisions of the act in cities or illages of over 5,000 
inhabitants is placed [by section 6] upon certain officers, who have no legal existence.’’ 
“There areother marked defects and inconsistencies,”’ says State Superintendent Esta- 
prookin his report of 1839, ‘“‘that combine to render the enforcement of thislaw impracti- 
cable. The act should either be repealed or made effective by harmonizing conflicting 
sections, providing suitable penalties, and designating definitely whose duty itshall he

_ Chapter XXILof the General School Laws provides for the compulsory reformatory 
education of juvenile disorderly persons. It authorizes the school boards of cities, vil- 
lages, and townships maintaining a graded school to establish one or more ungraded 
schools, and to require the attendance thereat of, (1) habitual truants; (2) incorrigibly 
turbulent, disobedient, or insubordinate pupils; and (3) unemployed children, not en- 
rolled in the publie schools, frequenting the streets. The appointment of truant offi- 
cers is provided for; and parents refusing to send children to a reformatory school after 
being duly warned are made subject to a fine of from ten to twenty-five dollars. 
As regards the enforcement of compulsory education in Michigan, State Superintend- 
ent Joseph Estabrook writes (January 29, 1890): ‘‘ No information is gathered on the 
subject by thisdepartment. We have learned incidentally of:a strict enforcement of 
the law in some of the cities, but very little, if any, attention is paid to it in the coun- 
Ary districts,’? i 
"The Detroit ungraded school.—In conformity with the provisions of Chapter XXI, an 
ungraded school has been established in Detroit for the ‘‘compulsory reformatory edu- 
cation of juvenile disorderly persons.’’ This school in 1886 enrolled. 372 different pupils, 
of whom 136 were voluntary. City Superintendent J. M. B. Sill says that the law 
under which it is operated is defective, and that there is difficulty in holding boys whom 
the school is designed for without the consent of their parents. ‘‘ But, even under these 
discouraging circumstances, the school established has been a most useful institution.

whose influence was dangerous to good order and good morals, giving them at the same 
time the advyahtage of proper restraint and needed instruction.”? ! | | 
Grand Rapids ungraded school.—Of this school Superintendent F..M, Kendall says 
(1889): ‘‘The attendance of the ungraded school has been larger this year than for- 
merly, notwithstanding every effort: has been made to return boys to the schools from erie ; ;

mit, Most of the members of the schoo! are confirmed truants, or are boys whose pres- 
ence in a well-ordered school is a source of harm to the other pupils and a daily burden 
to the teacher. Many of them are resting under the suspended sentence of the court 
for criminal acts and for truancy, and a number have been sent to the reform school 
during the year. ; 
“And yet a good proportion of boys who have been compelled to attend this school 
have returned to their own schools and have given no farther trouble. I regard the un- 
graded school as an important factor in our educational system. Not the least good 
which it does is to stand as a warning to boys whose conduct might otherwise be much 
worse than it is.” ? \

WASHINGTON, Bie} 
A compulsory-education law was enacted in 1871 requiring bilsaatal guardians, ete., 
to send children eight to sixteen years of age to school at least three months of each year, 
upon penalty of $100 for each case of failure, provided ‘‘no good reason can be shown 
for the failure.’”? This law was repealed in 1873. } 
Tn 1877'a section was again introduced into the school law requiring attendance at 
school of all children from eight tosixteen years in places of more than 400 inhabitants 
for six months each year. There was no penalty for noncompliance attached nor pro- 
vision for enforcement. y 
*In 1883 the law of 1871 was reénacted, except that it was made to include children 
between eight and eighteen years. Bysome oversight the word ‘parents’? was omitted, 
go as to leave it virtually applicable only to orphans. , * 
All the above Jaws were inoperative. 
In 1890 the present law was enacted, of which the sections providing for compulsory 
education read as follows: 
‘AI parents, guardians, and other persons in this State haying, or who may hereafter have, im- 
mediate custody of any child or children between the ages of eight and fifteen years, shallsend the 
same to school at least three months in each year said child or children may remain under their 
super person mentioned in the preceding sections who shall fail or refuse to comply with the pro- 
visions of said sections shall be deemed guilt y of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof 
Thali be fined in any sum not Jess than ten dollars or more than twenty-tive dollars, and the fine 
‘so collected shall be paid into the school fund of the district, 4 | 
Regarding the Washington law State Supt. R. B. Brian writes: “The Jaw has never 
heen enforced, and there seems to be no disposition on the part of the public to attempt 
' the enforcement of it. My judgment is, that in so far as the rural districts are con- 
cerned, it will be a dead letter for years to come.?? i 
NEVADA. | 
A compulsory law which is still in force was passed in 1873, abheckiog the following 
requirements: : 
‘Every parent or other person having control of a child between eight and fourteen ahall send ve 
toa public school for sixteen weeks each year, eight of which must be consecutive, unless excused 
by the school trustees on account of the bodily or mental condition of the child or because it has 
been instructed elsewhere. Atthe end ‘of four school months the trustees are directed to proceed 
eee iect the penalty from any one violating this act. Penalty for the first offense, $50 to$100; for 
each subsequent offense, $100 to $200. ° 
State Supt. W. C. Dovey says of this law ina letter to the Bureau dated February 
11, 1890: ‘* The law, from the beginning, was a dead letter. The statute for compul- 
sory education was enacted to meet a condition in our towns and cities. It is sel- 
dom needed in rural districts, the children generally finding employment on the farm, 
and are eager to quit work for the easier tasks of the schoolhouse; but in our mining 
towns many boys are idle owing to the restrictions of labor unions, which prevent them 
from learning trades or entering the mines. Such boys are generally averse to going to 
school, aud here the compulsory law is needed to be enforced.

An act was passed in 1874 to the following effect: 
Every parent or other person having charge of any child between eight and fourteen years of 
age must send it toa public school for two-thirds of the publieschool teri, twelve weeks of which 
must be consecutive, unless excused on account of the bodily or mental condition of the child, or 
the poverty or sickness of its parents, or unless it has been instructed elsewhere. Penalty for violating this act, twenty dollars and costs forthe first offense; for each subsequentoffense, twenty 
dollars to fifty dollars and costs, The clerk of the board of education or of the district trustees, on 
complaint of any teacher or taxpayer, must prosecute all offenses under this act or be liable to a 
fine of twenty dollars to fifty dollars.’ All deaf, dumb, and blind children must be sent for five 
years to the institution provided for such persons, unless excused for the reasons before mentioned. 
Penalties same as before. j 
This actisstiilin force. The reports of the State superintendents have called attention 
to the circumstance from time to time that it is a dead letter in nearly all parts of the 
State. ‘This is occasioned,” says Supt. Ira G. Hoitt, in 1888, ‘‘partly by the fact 
that some towns and cities have not sufficient school accommodations for all those 
who apply for admission, and partly from the indifference and negligence of parents and 
guardians.”’ 
It has been recommended to amend the law so as to meet those cases in which parents 
claim to be too poor to send their children to school. ‘‘The law enacted to enforce the 
educational rights of children so effectually guards against any encroachment upon the 
rights of parents, that it utterly fails to accomplish the purpose for whieh it was en- 
acted.’’! 
\ 
' MAINE. 
Towns were authorized to make by-laws against truancy in 1850. In 1875, in addi- 
tion, an act was passed requiring the attendance at school, either public or private, of 
every child between the ages of nine and fifteen years for at least twelve weeks in each 
year, unless excused from such attendance by the school officers of the town for physical 
or mental disability, or because of living more than a mile and a half by the shortest 
traveled road from any school, or having been taught at home. Parents, ete., were 
fined five dollars for noncompliance, and boys neglecting or refusing to attend forfeited 
the same, ‘The duty of enforcing this act was imposed upon school committees and 
supervisors. ‘ 
“Tam not aware,’’ said State Superintendent Luce, in 1887, ‘‘that the provisions of 
this act were ever anywhere enforced. I know that its enforcement was generally found 
to be impracticable whenever any supervisor who sought to enforce it in some aggravated 
case of absenteeism came to the question of ways and means.’’ 
In view of the defective character of this law the legislature of 1887 enacted. a substi- 
tute requiring every person having under his control a child between eight and fifteen 
years.of age to send it to a public school sixteen weeks each year, divided as faras pos- 
sible into two terms of eight weeks each, unless it has been instructed elsewhere or 
labors under some bodily or mental disability. Anyone not complying is to forfeit not 
more than twenty-five dollars. Cities and towns are required to elect truant officers, 
who are to enforce this law. Any city or town or truant officer neglecting this require- 
ment is to forfeit from ten to fifty dollars. Any boy between ten and fifteen years of 
age found wandering about the streets during school hours is to be committed to the 
State reform school, but it satisfactory pledges are obtained from him or the person bay- 
.ing him in charge that in the future he will conform to the requirements he shall not be 
prosecuted so long as the pledges are faithfully kept. 
Regarding this law Superintendent Luce writes (January 28, 1890): ‘As to its effi- 
ciency in securing the ends desired, the result depends largely upon the activity and 
efficiency of truant officers, and this upon the countenance and interest of the commu- 
nities of the towns of the State. In many cities and towns the increase of average 
attendance has been marked; in others little change has been discernible. The passage 
of the law has been too recent to decide upon the actual or prospective results to be 
secured by its general enforcement. Some amendments will probably result from the 
general enforcement of its provisions.” ,

  ( COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE—ONIO. Be kD 
This law remained on the statute book until 1889, when a more complete law was ‘ i 
passed, which, as amended in 1890, ‘is in substance as follows: 
Every parent or other person having control of any child between eight and fourteen years of age must send it to school for twenty “weeks each year in city districts, and for sixteen weeks in 
special, village, and township districts, unless excused on account of the physical or mental con- dition of such child or because it has been instructed at home. ‘ All parents or-other persons hav- ing control of children between eight and sixteen years of age not engaged in any regular employ- | ment are required tosend them to school during the fullterm it is continned, Any parent orother person failing tocomply with these requirements isliable to be punished by a fine of not less than g five doliars nor more than twenty dollars. But if the parent or other person is unable to cause ; the child or children to attend school, they may be sent to the juvenile reformatory. No person or company is to employ any child under fourteen who has not attended school as required, or has not completed the usual primary and grammar grades; a fine of fifty dollars is imposed for any, violation of this provision, All children over fourteen and under sixteen who can nét read and write must attend school one-half of each day, or an evening school, or be instructed privately until he or she shall be able to read and write; any person or company employing such a child, who is not receiving the instruction required, is made liable to a fine of fifty dollars, unless provi- sion has been made for its instruction. Every parent or other person having control of any child 
under sixteen who has been discharged from business in order to receive instruction must send such child to school until it becomes able to read and write, or be liable to fine or imprisonment. ‘Truantofficers are required to be appointed to enforce the above provisions.    
Comments. on the law.—Referring to this law, Hon. John “Hancock, State school com- é 
missioner, writes (January 30, 1890): ‘‘It has gone into operation so recently that I am 
unable to speak with definiteness as to results. I can say, however, that we have favor- A 
able reports of its workings from all parts of the State. Of course the greatest benefits ae 
to be derived from the execution of the law will be in the cities and towns, especially mi 
those largely engaged in manufacturing. But I see no reason why the law should not § 
work equally well in the country districts. _We deem the enactment of the law a great 
step in educational progress in our State,”’ 
An inguiry as to results and defects. —The following cireular to school superintendents 
of cities and towns of Ohio was sent out by the State school commissioner May 29,1890: > 
  GENTLEMEN: As you are fully aware, the compulsory-education law is one of the highest mo- 1 ment to our people, I am therefore anxious to learn with some definiteness how it is working in the different sections of the State. Ishall be greatly obliged to you, then, if you will give me in- formation on the following points: / 1, What have been the results of the enforcement of the law in your own field of labor? 2, What is the feeling of the community towards the law ? 8. If any opposition has manifested itself against the law, what is the source of that opposition? “4, In the execution of the law, what weaknesses, if any, have been developed? 5. What remedies for these weaknesses can you suggest? Any information or suggestions not called for by the above questions will be thankfully received, Very respectfully, yours, 
  Joun Hancock, Commissioner, 
The answers to this inquiry are thus summed up by Mr.! Hancock:! 
‘*To this circular answers weré returned from ninety-four superintendents, one clerk 
ofa board of education, and one truant officer. In thirteen of the ninety-six localities 
represented, it was reported that no action to carry out the law had been taken by their 
respective boards of education. ° 
“1. Of the eighty-three localities distributed throughout the State wherein the boards

increase in the school attendance—in some, that everybody due at school had been

' ' 
+\to be performed to act, and the enforcement of the law would soon become universal. 
The execution of the act in the large cities has been impaired to a considerable extent 
by the fact that in none of them has more than one truant officer been appointed, How- 
ever, as the beneficial effects of the law shall more and more reveai themselves, we may: 
expect boards to adopt a more and more liberal policy on this point. 
‘* Knowing that Cleveland has maintained for some years separate schools for special 
classes of pupils, I addressed a letter of inquiry to Hon. L. W. Day, superintendent of 
the schools of that city, as to the workings of these separate schools. I here insert his 
answer, believing it may prove suggestive to boards of education in other cities in con- 
nection with the compulsory law. He says: 
For a number of years we have maintained three separate schools—requiring the services of five 
teachers—known as “ungraded schools,” or ‘boys’ schools,” as they are now officially termed. 
To these schools we have assigned pupils whose presence in the regular schoolroom proved un- 
necessarily disorganizing, or who on account of truancy, offensive personal habits, persistent de- 
fiance of authority, ete., require an undue amount of attention. These schools are taught by gen- tlemen who are supposed to be strong disciplinarians, as well as excellent teachers. ‘Che course 
of study is the same as that pursued in the regular schools, and the general rules and regulations of the schools apply to their management, Corporal punishment is allowed in these scliools, but 
not elsewhere. "Phe enforcement of the compulsory law brings in many neglected children—waifs without friends or homes, or belonging to homes that are worse than none. For such pupils—pupils who need to” 
go through a sort of cleansing and toning process—these schools are just the thing. Boys familiar with the street and its ways feel better in a school for boys than they would in a school composed of both sexes; at least it is better that many of these should be thus assigned. : 
We are making a vigorous push in the enforcement of the law, but with only one truant officer 
many cases slip through our fingers, We have butlittle trouble in enforcing the law so far as the pupils of the public schools are con- cerned, but there are many who enter no school whom we find it difficult to reach, We are en- deayoring to arrange matters so that we shall have the codperation and active aid of the police of 
the city. , With this help we shall soon make it unsafe for pupils in the street during school hours. We have established no special schools in consequence of the compulsory law, but as occasion re- quires we make excellent use of the schools referred to above, 
“Tn my visits to institutes, to county teachers’ associations, and to other educational 
meetings, I have taken occasion to call attention to the importance of this law, and to 
explain its provisions and the proper methods of procedure under it to the best of my 
ability. All the information as to public feeling I could gather at these meetings, as 
well as by conversation with prominent citizens in the various callings of life, has been in 
entire harmony with the written statements of the superintendents of schools in reply 
to the questions propounded in my circular. 
‘Considering, then, that the law was new to all to whom its enforcement was com- 
mitted, and that some of its provisions were not altogether plain, as well as the further 
facts that the law was to go into effect in the middle of the school year (which proved 
a great embarrassment in its execution), and that the schools had been workiug under 
it but halfa year, the favorable results obtained are full of encouragement for the fu- 
ture, when the principle of enforced attendance will be applied under the Jaw greatly 
strengthened and improved in other respects than those already named, and by officers 
of larger experience. If public sentiment shall in the future stand as firmly for the law 
as it now does, we have a right to expect that in the course of two or three years nearly 
all the friction now incident to its enforcement will have disappeared, and that we shall 
gather the full fruits of its wise provisions.” 
DAKOTA, 
The Dakota law, first enacted in 1833 and amended in 1887, contains the following 
provisions: f 
Every parent or other person having control of any child between the ages of ten and fourteen years is required to send such child to a public school twelve weeks in each year, six of which shall be consecutive, unless such child be excused on account of bodily or mental infirmity, or has been instructed elsewhere, or has already completed the public-school branches. The director of the subdistrict is instructed to ascertain if there are any children not attending school as required; and, if so, he must direct that they be sent to school. If such children are not then sent to school he is to make complaint before some justice of the peace, and the parent or person having them in charge is liable to a fine of not less than ten dollars nor more than twenty-five dollars. If the director fail to make such complaint, he becomes liable to the same penalty as that provided for the parent or person having the ehild in charge. 
      
  _ The Territorial board, in their report for 1888, called attention to the fact thatthe pro- 
portion of school children enrolled had fallen off during the year from 83 to 81 per cent.; 
and they go on to state: ‘“‘This means thata smaller per cent. of the children of the Ter- 
xitory are enrolled in the public schools, and, taken in connection with the fact that we

have a compulsory clause in our school law, it is all the more remarkable. The con- 
clusion is not, however, that the compulsory law js entirely a dead letter. We know of 
_ some cases it has reached quite effectively; but, as rule, the compulsory clause is not 
enforced. But the above statements show that, while a smaller proportion of the chil- 
dren attend our schools, those who areenrolled attend more regularly, there having been 
a gain of 1 per cent. in this regard over 1887. It doesseem that more than 81 per cent. 
of the children of the school age ought to be brought into th schools. The compulsory 
education clause has certainly not accomplished all that its supporters expected of it. It 
the State must support schools, it certainly has the right to compel attendance. Itisa 
very common error among the people that schools are suppo! ted for the benefit of indi- 
viduals, and that an education is of advantage to the child or parent only, and that it is 
no business of the State ifthe child, or his parents for him, decline to accept the school 
advantages offered. This is not only absurd, but wrong. The whole idea of the public 
school'is compulsory. A system that would simply permit the establishment and main- 
tenance of a school would be no system at all. ‘The State has the right to compel the 
support of schools, and the further right to compel attendance. ork e 
* We would respectfully advise that our compulsory clause be not only retained but 
be made more effective. In its present shape it is too cumbersome, and burdened with 
too many qualifications, and is too difficult of application. We are conyinced that the 
compulsory age should be extended from ten to fourteen years—to seven to fifteen years, 
and the term of attendance extended from twelve to sixteen wees per year. The only 
excuse for nonattendance should be bodily or mental infirmity, attendance at some 
private school for the same length of time, or too great ghia from the nearest school- 
house. Local school officers who receive no compensation should not be charged with 
the execution of the law. Such a provision, if enforced, would be a most fertile source 
of neighborhood quarrels, of which the number is large enough. This regulation isa 
police regulation, and there should be some officers in each county required to execute 
the law. If the compulsory law were properly amended, there are many indications 
that it could be used to bring many of the delinquent children into the schools.’’ 
MONTANA. 
The Montana law, enacted in 1883, is virtually jdentical with the Kansas law of 1874, 
already given on page 503. The only change calling for notice is the introduction in the 
second section of the alternative penalty of thirty days’ imprisonment in the county jail 
for the second and each subsequent offense on the part of parents, etc. 
With reference to this law State Superintendent John Gannon writes. (February 1, 
1890): ‘It stands to-day a dead letter upon the statute book. There has not been a 
single conviction under it to my knowledge; and as to its efficiency in rural districts, 
as compared with cities, would state that it has never been enforced in either.’ k 
MINNESOTA. : 
I \ 
Minnesota adopted compulsory education in 1885. A law was enacted that year which 
also is.a literal transcript of the present Kansas law (of 1874), given on page 503, except 
that the compulsory age is made. eight to sixteen instead of eight to fourteen, and the 
penalties imposed on parents and guardians for noncompliance are ten to twenty-five 
dollars for the first offense, and twenty-five to fifty dollars for each subsequent offense, 
instead of as in the Kansas law. { 
The following statement made in 1836 by State Superintendent Kiehle regarding the 
enforcement of this law he says is practically true to-day (1850): . i 
‘Tam not able to report any substantial aid gained from the law on compulsory 
education. Several superintendents have undertaken to enforce it, but the results have 
not been permanent. The reasons of failure have been: 5 f 
“1, Defectsinthelaw. It very properly allows children to be educated in other than 
the public schools, yet leaves the conditions so indefinite that, there is not the least 
guaranty that the children are receiving the equivalent of a common school education. 
‘Whatever else is required, every school which is to be recognized by the law should certify 
that it is conducted in the English language, and that instruction is given in the branches 
of a common school education, viz: reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, and the geog- 
raphy and history of the United States. ‘ | 
“9, The difficulty inherent in this method of improving the people. The more chil- 
dren there are in any given district who do not attend school, the more probable it is that} 
no one in the district will take the trouble, or endure the odium necessary to the enforce-

- eountry, whose duty it would be to attend to the enforcement of the law.””

    COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE—NEBRASKA. 
NEBRASKA. 
School attendance was not made compulsory until 1887, when the following law was 
enacted: . 
Sxcrion 1. That it shall be unlawful for any parent or guardian, living in the State of Nebraska, to neglect or refuse to cause or compel any one person, or persons, who are, or may be under their control as their children or wards, to attend and comply with the rules of some one or more public or privaté school, or schools, for aterm of twelve weeks or more, during each successive year from the time said children, or wards, are eight years old until they are fourteen years old inclusive, unless they may be prevented by illness, poverty, inability, or by reason of already being profi- cient, from attending such public or private school or schools: And provided, That in such case they shall be excused by the board of education of the school district in which said children or wards 
may live at the time of such failure to attend such public or private school or schools. 
Sc. 2, That any person or persons violating this act shall be subject to a fine of not less than ten dollars nor more than fifty dollars foreach and every offense. Said fine shall be imposed by 
any court of justice having jurisdiction on sufficient evidence of the same, being furnished by two or more credible witnesses, and all fines so collected shall be placed in the general school fund the same as other fines and penalties. ‘ 
Regarding this law Hon. Geo. B. Lane, State superintendent, writes as follows (Feb- 
ruary 12, 1890): ‘‘The eompulsory law of this State was passed in the spring of 1887. 
Before that time no accurate statistics were kept of pupils between eight and fourteen 
years of age. Since this date an actual enumeration of such children and their attend- 
ance at school have been made. The following facts show the effect of the law in this 
State: The total enumeration of all school children in the State for the years 1886-87 
was 279,550, of this number 194,661 were enrolled in the public schools; this gives 69.6 
per cent. of all children of school age enrolled in the schools. In 1887-88 the total 
enumeration of school children was 298,006. ‘The total public school attendance was 
215,889, giving 72.1 per cent. enrolled in the schools. This same year the records show 
138,325 children in the State between eight and fourteen years old; and 112,074 ens 
rolled in the public schools, giving 80.8 per cent. of those between eight and fourteen 
enrolled in the public schools. This was the first year after the passage of the com- 
pulsory law. For the year 1888-89 the total enumeration was 316,805, and 232,344 
were enrolled in the schools, giving 73.3 per cent. of the total school population en- 
* rolled in the schools. During the same year there were 143,208 children between eight 
and fourteen years old in the State with 119,932 enrolled in the schools, giving 83,7 
per cent. of all the children between eight and fourteen enrolled in the schools. I am 
reasonably assured that the school year 1889-90 will show as good or even a better rec- 
ord. f 
‘‘In the matter of the efficiency of compulsory education in this State, I will say, 
from my experience, it is of more real service here in the West than in the East. While 
there has been an increase here in attendance, there has been at the same time an in- 
crease in efficiency in instruction and in the length of school. Thisis especially shown 
. in the fact that most of our country schools have adopted a regular cotirse of study, and 
the average school term in the State was increased five days last year. 
**Tam of the opinion that education, social and moral elevation, is not a field to be 
improved by legal enactments and prescription. _ Personal freedom has long been a cry / 
of our people and individual liberty has been nurtured by the very forms of our goy- 
ernment, But then, rational order, personal freedom, and individual liberty are secured 
only by general intelligence and wisdom. Here, then, comes the conflict, The law 
can not (as a law, a prescriptive rule of action) be enforced. It is against the funda- 
mental principles of our natures, as well as the expressed will of our people. But the 
real value of such a law is in the general environments given in favorof education. The 
true function of such legislation, in my opinion, is not to direct officially in the social affairs’ 
or education of the individual, but rather to codperate with and encourage all to receive the 
benefits of the school. The child is taught to think, to act, and to do for himself. ‘This is ‘ 
the spirit of our institutions, and by this self-activity he becomes self-governing. 
‘Again, the very nature of education, as well as the entire ethical being of man, is 
east and fostered in the exercise of freedom. Freedom of the willand free moral agency 
have long since been conceded to the individual. A person’s education is not only an 
‘ act of his mental powers, but to accomplish what the law attempts, it must be a free act 
of the person. The execution of the law would make it otherwise than a free act of 
the individual. ie 
‘*My general impression is, that here in Nebraska the law has resulted in just what 
the local school authorities desired to make of it. In quite a number of counties, in 
which there were active county superintendents and others who had a real.interest in 
education, the subject has been discussed and the people encouraged so much as to.have 
every child between eight and fourteen years of age in school. The same js true in re- 
gard to the cities. In certain cities every child between eight and fourteen has been 
brought into the schools,

Effect of the law.—Territorial Superintendent Charles C. Stevenson says of this law 
(February 13, 1890): ‘“Ttisdefective. Itsintentionsare good, butin a new country Jike 
this, where many settlements are badly scattered, it is well-nigh impossible to enforce 
jts provisions. ‘The Jaw was passed, like many other enactments, under a suspension 
of the rules and with a hurrah. b | 
“Prom some school districts T have received very favorable reports regarding enforce- 
ment, but the opposite is the case from the majority. My impression is. thatif there is 
any difference at all, the rural districts lead the cities and towns as to efficiency. In 
the towns there are more attractions for both sexes, while in the rural districts the * 
sole difficulty is found in the necessity to keep the children at home to assist in the 
manual labor of the farm. I have found it to be the case that in the towns the tendency 
of parents is to shield their children and provide them with excuses for truancy (for 
many absences ean be distinguished under no other name), while in the rural districts 
the parents are extremely desirous of giving their children the most of the limited 
schooling furnished them. My sympathies are with the country schools; and in my 
opinion surer foundations for good education and useful men and women are laid in the 
rural schools of three or four ‘months’ duration, than in the well-equipped and splen- 
didly-endowed institutions of the cities.’’ 
  , NEW MEXICO. : 
School attendance was made compulsory in New Mexico at least as early as 1870." 
‘As the public-school system at that date jad not been developed to any considerable 
extent, in some places there being a very general opposition to it, there can be no doubt 
that compulsion existed only in name. © 
Other compulsory-education laws were passed in subsequent years, put were appar- 
ently never enforced. In 1887'a law was enacted which was so defective in wording 
that it ‘‘did not compel anything or anybody.’’? The school act approved February 12, 
“1891, contains the following provisions, being the law now in force: 
‘The school directors of the various districts in this Territory are hereby empowered and required 
to compel parents, guardians, or other persons having the control, care, or direction of children, 
tenon such children do not attend some private school, to send such children under their control 
to the public school for atleast three months in each year, except when such children shall be under 
eight or above sixtee. years of age, or of such physical disability as to antit them for the labor 
tequired, which disability shall be certified to by some regular practicing physician. Any parent, 
guardian, or other person having the control of children who shall fail or refuse to send such chil- 
Ruano school as required by this act, shall be punished upon ‘conviction thereof by a fine of not 
Jess than one dollar nor more than twenty-five dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than ten

Compulsory education in Colorado dates only from 1889, The law enacted that year 
is as follows: 
AN ACT to secure to children the benefit of elementary education. 
Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Colorado, That it shall be unlawful for any per- 
son, persons, or corporation to employ any child under the'age of fourteen years to labor in any business whatever during the school hours of,any school day, of the school term of the public school, in the school district where such child is, uniess such child shall have attended some public or private day school where instruction was given by a teacher qualified to instract in those branches required to be taught in the public school of the State of Colorado, or shall have been regularly instructed at home in such branches, by some persou qualified to instruct in the same, at

VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS AND OPINIONS. 
Unnecessary to argue about the power of the State, State Superintendent A. §. Draper, 
of New York: It is worse than futile to assume that all persons charged with the care* 
of children willsend them to school. ‘The great majority will. But unfortunately 
_ some parents are idlers, drunkards, or criminal themselves. In every large community 
there are many children without parental care of any kind. There are also children 
* who are uncontrollable who might be saved to society by a strong hand and firm dis- 
cipline, but who in the absence of these will become outcasts and criminals. It seems 
unnecessary to argue that the Stat has the power to provide for these exceptional cases, 
and that there is great propriety in its doing so. The rights of the helpless child to 
reasonable care and the elements of an education on the one hand and the interests of 
. society on the other are both in jeopardy and can be protected and promoted only by 
sovernment which provides a free public-school system for 
public action. Moreover, a & 
its own safety ismecessarily ound to see to it that all children who are not otherwise 
‘ provided for are brought within the influences of that system if it would make sure of 
results which will justify its precedence. i 
. ‘Summary punishment for the purent.—Supt. W. EH. Maxwell, of Brooklyn, N. Y.: There 
js a large and, I regret to say, a constantly inereasing class of parents, either too negli- 
gent or too depraved to give their children an education. These people we are now 
- powerless to reach. — ‘A law which does not provide summary punishment for the parents 
who neglect this duty, all-important, both to the State and to the individual, is un- 
worthy of this age and country. ’ ¢ i 
? ” ‘The compulsory term should be extended; the continuation schools (Fortbildungsschu lew) of 
Germany.—Riehard T. Ely, in the Century Magazine: Compulsory education laws should 
everywhere be passed and enforced a4 in other civilized countries. Education is a right 
¢ of.a child, the right to existence carr ‘ing with it the right to an opportunity for an un- 
folding of its powers, and if parents {to do their duty it only yemains for the State

child. Compulsory education should continue in ordinary schools until the age of four-

teen, and be followed by continuation evening classes for three years, as ih parts of | 
Switzerland and Germany, where they have almost annihilated pauperism. — Instruc- 
tive are these remarks quoted from Mr, Samuel Smith, M. P., who has made a study of 
common schools on the continent of Europe. The quotations are taken from an article 
which appeared in the London Times. Speaking of Germany, he says: 
‘There is no such thing as an uneducated class; there are no such things, speaking 
broadly, as neglected and uncared-for children. * * * The great defect of oursys- 
tem (that is, the Engiish system) * * * is that it stops just at the time when real 
. education begins. It allows a child to leave school at an age when its learning is soon 
forgotten and its discipline effaced. It is hardly too much to say that the two years’ 
additional training the German child receives in thé elementary school doubles its 
chances in life as compared with the English child. * * * The Germans arerapidly 
developing a system of evening continuation classes which carry on education for two or 
three yearslonger. In Saxony the boys who leave the primary school, if they do notgo to 
the higher schools, must attend for three years longer—say until they are,seventeen— 
continuation classes for at least five hours per week, but teaching is provided for them 
and they are encouraged to attend twelve hours per week. So complete is this system 
that even the waiters at the hotels up to the age of seventeen attend afternoon classes, 
. and are taught one or two foreign languages. * * * JI must state as an undoubted 
fact that in Germany and Switzerland, and I believe in some other continental eoun- 
tries, the opinion is ripening into a conviction that the education, even of the poorest 
classes, should be continued in some form or other to the age of sixteen or seventeen, 
They find that wherever this is adopted it givesan enormous advantage to the people 
in the competition of life, and, above all, trains them to habits of industry and mental 
application, I believe that it is owing to this'system of thorough education that Ger- 
many has almost extinguished the pauper and semipauper class, which is the bane and 
disgrace of our country. * * * Indeed, I have not seen since I left homea single 
case of a ragged or begging child. * * * Nocountry has ever suffered more from the 
abuse of individual liberty than England has done. Owing to this overstrained idea, 
we did notiget compulsory education until long after the advanced nations of the Conti- 
nent, * * * Wherever the Germans and English are coming into competition upon 
equal terms the Germans are beating us. * * * We, up to lately, resented all state 
interference, and so exaggerated the doctrines of freedom as almost to glory in our 
abuses. ’? 
Private effort never has and never can carry forward universal education. Private 
gifts for educational purposes in the United States may amount to six or seven millions 
of dollars—a large part of it, as the president of Cornell has shown, misapplied and 
wasted—whereas the very inadequate expenditure of New York State alone is some six- 
teen millions a year. It is safe to say that we should spend three times what we do on 
ourschools. Means for this can be secured by husbanding our resources, cutting off 
needless expenditures, and improving our system of taxation. 
Compulsory education not the remedy in Missouri.—State Superintendent W. E. Cole- 
man: Compulsory education is another question that is receiving considerable attention 
and eliciting much discussion. itis the opposite extreme to thé laxity, carelessness, 
and indifference so prevalent in too many communities relative to regularity of attend- 
ance of the children in the public schools of said communities. But the question nat-— 
urally arises, is a compulsory law the proper remedy? In my humble judgment, it is - 
not. There are now sixteen States that have legislated upon this subject, but in not 
one of them is the law enforced. Why is there room or occasion for such a demand ? 
Where does the complaint of nonattendance come from? Is the cause found in dis- 
tricts that have good schools, that employ experienced teachers and pay fair wages? Or 
is it found in districts in which just the reverse is the case? My experience has been 
that in the districts characterized by liberality toward their schools, nonattendance is 
reduced to the minimum, and in such communities there is no demand for a compul- 
sory law. The demand for such a law comes from those districts in which the schools 
are of the least value, the teachers employed are unworthy the position they occupy, 
the school term just as short and the taxes as low as the law will permit. Compulsory 
education is not the remedy in Missouri; what we most need to make our schools effi- 
cient are more active and energetic school officers, better qualified teachers, longer school 
terms, better salaries and good, wholesome, efficient county supervision. * * * 
Advocates of this compulsory theory rush to hasty conclusions in making up their 
verdict, and thereby endeavor to sustain their ground by the flimsiest argument imag- 
inable; in fact, by figures that are perfectly absurd. For instance, they say, ‘‘ Look 
’ here, take the enumeration and enrollment and compare them, and behold the mighty 
army of children that are growing aR in absolute ignorance in the State.’? Consider 
this argument a minute and see the fallacy. 
The enumeration for the State last May was 865,364, while the actual enrollment re-

  ported to this office for last year, many districts making no report, was 611,541; from these figures the advocates of compulsory, laws claim that ‘there are 253,823 children in Missouri who are actually growing up in ignorance as dense as that in the jungles of Africa.’? d 
If this be true, the situation is actually deplorable. But is it true? No, not one word of truth in the statement. Let these parties answer the following questions: Of those enumerated last May, over six and twenty years of age, how many of this 253,823 belong to each of the following classes : 
1. Married? 
2. Teaching in this State? 7 
8. Graduates of reputable schools? 
4. Attending private, State, and denominational schools? 5. Have completed the common-school course and are now out at work in the various vocations of life? : 
6. Over six, but their parents consider them too young to go to school? 7. Have a fair knowledge of the common school branches ? 8. Idiots, lunaties, imbeciles, feeble, blind, deaf, and demented ? 9. ‘A part of the children of tamilies attend school one year and the others the next? 10. The number of others that any compulsory law would necessarily exempt from attendance? 
Please fill out these items and subtract the result from 253,823, and see how many are actually growing upin ignorance. They will find they have a problem they can not solve; and furthermore, if they are honest, they will never again undertake to prove the necessity for compulsory education by such consummate sophistry. 
  
COMPULSORY EDUCATION IN PRUSSIA. 
A HISTORICAL REVIEW. 
[From Das gesammie Volkssclulwesen im preussischen Staate (1886) and Das Volksschulwesen in Preussen.] 
Two hundred years had passed since Luther, in his famous open letter to the magis- trates of cities, urged the establishment of day schools, and appealed to the duty of Christians, in behalf of the training of the young, to make the establishment and support of schools a governmental affair. One hundred years had passed since, for the first time, it was convincingly demonstrated in scientific form that every human being receives from his Creator not only the capability of being educated, but also the right to be ed- ucated and trained; that though man is created in the image of God, the child possesses. only the possibility of that image, and that in order to fulfill its destiny it must be ed- ucated and instructed, hence also the paramount duty of the community or state to provide for general education of the youth; and in the year 1713 King Frederick Will- iam I of Prussia took a very decisive step by ordering, on the 24th of October, 1713, the drawing-up of instructions, mandatory in nature, which proved to be the embryo of German compulsory-attendancelaws. On the 28th of. September, 1717, the king issued the first law concerning compulsory attendance, which reads as follows: “We, by the grace of God, Frederick William, King in Prussia, margrave of Bran- denburg, archchamberlain, and grand elector of the Holy Roman Empire, have noticed with displeasure a thing about which inspectors and preachers raise complaint, namely that parents, especially in the country, prove negligent in sending their children to school, in consequence of which negligence the poor youth are kept in gross ignorance as concerns reading, writing, and ciphering, as well as that which concerns the weal and salvation of their souls. Hence, to counteract this destructive evil at once, we have resolved with grace to issue this our general edict, and to order earnestly that hereafter wherever there are schools in the place the parents shall be obliged, under severe pen- alty, to send their children to school. The tuition fee is fixed at two threepence (zwei Dreier) per week for every child. School is to be attended daily in winter, but insum- mer at least twice a week, when the parents need their children at home and on the 
In cases farm, so that what has been learned in winter shall not be forgotten in summer. where parents have not the méans to pay this much, the fee is to be paid from the com- munity’s funds. We also earnestly command preachers, especially in the country, hold ‘catechizations’ with their congregations on Sunday afternoons,

“This is to be followed and obeyed because given by our will and command. It is

‘‘Von Dohnhoff, Ilgen, Von Blaspiel, Von Plotho.’’ 
This cabinet order received several modifications which defined it better in a subse- 
quent order, dated September 29, 1739. This order (at that time a law, because Prussia 
was an absolute monarchy) was the beginning of a series of laws for compulsory school 
attendance, but its main features remained the stock upon which all subsequent changes 
were grafted. The various provisions and subsequent orders, among which that of July 
30, 1736, was the most remarkable, were all special orders referring to separate prov- 
inces. The last one mentioned is known in the history of the Prussian schools by its 
title, Principia Regulativa. It was the first attempt at regulating the school system of 
a province and lifted it above local whims and interference. 
In 1763 (August 12) the General Country School Regulations were issued by Frederick 
the Great, who was farsighted enough to see that ignorance is the greatest crime of 
omission in any state. Frederick’s efforts in behalf of public education were less suc- 
cess!ul than they deserved to have been, because he had not a sufficient number of well- 
trained teachers. Although he tried to supply the demand by placing military petty 
officers who were mustered out after the Seven Years’ War in the schools as teachers, his 
whole school system remained incomplete. 
The regulations he issued provided for compulsory education throughout the King- 
dom, uniting the best features of the various provincial orders then in existence.. They 
specify the length of school-going age, to wit, between five and thirteen; state the 
amount of tuition fees to be paid, namely, in winter six pence weekly for every child 
until it can read, nine pence after it can read and until it has acquired the art of writ- 
ing, but twelve pence (1 groschen) as soon as it can cipher. In summer, two-thirds of 
the winter fees (namely, four, six, or eight pence, respectively) are to be paid. If at any 
place a higher tuition fee has been agreed upon between teacher and parents, these reg- 
ulations shall not interfere with the arrangement. 
The regulations further provide for indigent pupils and throw the burden of the cost 
of their education upon the church or the village poor fund. But the King explicitly 
states that in the eyes of the teacher all children shall be equal, in so far as he must ex- 
pect to be paid by all, or for all, in order that he may treat them alike with diligence and 
faithfulness. The regulations also make minute provisions for punishing willful and 
intentional absence from school, for controlling the registers of population, and other 
items concerning the internal affairs of the school. 
King Frederick in these regulations erected a monument for himself, for they were 
of abiding historical significance, being the first school law which dealt with every phase 
of popular education—course of study, supervision, teachers, statistics, finances, man- 
agement, organization, etc. They created no little stir in other European countries, 
where attempts were made to imitate his example, notably in Italy. Many of these 
regulations are, in modified form, still in force in Prussia, though a number of provincial 
special orders have been issued. , 
In 1794 the Aligemeine Land-Recht (the General Code) was’ adopted, which contained ; 
two paragraphs (including scarcely more than forty items) devoted to school affairs. 
We quote four items: 
“Art, 29, Where there are no irreducible funds for the maintenance of common 
schools, the expenses for the support of the teachers are to be defrayed by the inhabit- 
ants of the place (town), regardless of whether they have children or not. 
“Ant. 34, Also the erection and keeping of buildings for school purposes and teachers’ 
dwellings is regarded a duty of the civil communities, therefore the expenses must be 
borne by all the inhabitants alike. 
“Ant, 43, Every inhabitant (Zinwohner) who can not provide his children with the 
necessary instruction at home is obliged to send them to ‘school after they have com- 
pleted the fifth year of life. 
“Arr. 46, The instruction in school must be continued until the child is found to 
possess the knowledge necessary to every rational being. ‘The clergyman of the dis- 
trict determines this.’’ 
The years immediately following the issuance of the Land-Recht were not favor- 
able to the development of the lower schools. The period of nonaction during which 
Minister of State Woellner tried to cheek the school system in its growth by his reaction- 
ary regulations of December 16, 1794, was only transitory and of short duration. King 
Frederick William III, from the first moment of his reign, directed his attention to the 
promotion of the people’s best interest, and concluded that in improving the schools he 
aided the people and strengthened his Government,

‘Then came the terrible time of degradation of Prussia by Napoleon the First. rhe 
Prussian state owes its rejuvenation to the wise counsel of such men as Ministers Stein 
and Hardenberg, Professor Fichte, and such military menas Gneisenau and Scharnhorst, 
and to them, primarily, may be attributed the vigorous execution of the compulsory- 
attendance laws in force in the various parts of the Kingdom. The entire state was 
reorganized, as is seen from this: 
On June 1, July 27, 1808, and on September 14, 1811, laws were issued which freed 
the peasants of the last obligations that had arisen from ancient feudal laws. A law, 
issued November 19, 1808, gave self-government to the cities; another, issued June 26, 
1811, created school boards in cities (committees of the city councils), and defined their 
functions; still another, issued October 28, 1812, established supervisory authorities in 
the country for elementary schools, 
Shortly after the Napoleonic wars, the secondary schools were reorganized and granted 
privileges. A law of October 23, 1817, transferred the functions of the former school 
consistory, consisting of clergymen, to the provincial school councils, which were spe- 
‘cially created and considered the representatives of the royal Government in school mat- 
ters. Finally, on November 3, 1817, a department of education was created under the 
title of '‘ Department of Worship, Public Instruction, and Medical Affairs.” Thus ina 
few years the governmental machinery of Frederick the Great, that had become anti- 
quated, was sweptaway, and a new structure put up which was more in harmony with 
the times and the spirit of the age of the French Revolution. The schools had through 
timely legislation become a state institution, the first of its kind in modern history. 
The schools, though poorly equipped at first, and often hampered by want of funds, did 
more toward rejuvenating the state than any other agency, save, perhaps, the army. 
From 1817, the entire school system of Prussia has been under the supervision and 
management of the Minister of Education (as his lengthy title is abbreviated). 
The difficulties in the way of making the system homogeneous were greater than is 
commonly known. Most of the component parts of the Prussian state were acquired 
by the crown at different times, and all had separate rights secured by inviolable treaties. 
In some parts of the Kingdom the ‘‘Code Napoleon ’’ was in force; some had provincial 
codes; some parts, notably those that were added by the Congress of Vienna, had no 
school systems. The cabinet order of May 14, 1825, attempted to regulate some of the 
existing inequalities by ordering that the tules laid down in the Land-Recht for 
school attendance be extended over all newly acquired territory. ‘This was felt to be a 
harsh measure, notably in Rhenish Prussia, where the Code Napoleon was in force. But 
how necessary that measure was is seen from a single fact, to wit: In the year 1824 
the governmental districtof Aix-la-Chapelle had 66,611 children of school age (5-14 years) ; 
of these were enrolled in school 34,140; hence 32,471 children were kept out of school, 
and many of them were employed in workshops and factories. In 1826 the minister 
had a census taken of school children thus employed, and in some governmental dis- 
tricts, such as Dusseldorf, Elberfeld, Crefeld, and Cologne, from 2,000 to 3,000 children 
were found employed in factories. I 
Slowly the work progressed, and the children were drawn into school without mak- 
ing the compulsory-attendance law onerous. State and communities, as well as private 
benevolence, united in enabling indigent parents to dispense with the services of their 
children, so that they might be sent to school. When in the year 1849, in consequence 
of the violent agitation of the popularly styled ‘ Revolution of 1848,” the various 
Kings and Princes of Germany granted constitutions to the people, making the states 
constitutional monarchies, the idea of compulsory attendance in school had been so uni- 
yersally accepted that it found expression in the constitutions. 
The Prussian constitution, signed and sworn to by King Frederick William IV, Jan- 
uary 31, 1850, contained these articles: t t 
“Apr. 20. Science and the teaching of science are free. 
“arr. 21. For theeducation of the young public schools shall be established and main- 
tained. Parents and guardians must not leave their children or wards without thatin- 
struction which is prescribed for the public school. 
“Ant. 22, To give instraction and to establish schools is allowed toevery one whocan 
prove to the state authorities moral, scientific, and technical capacity. : 
“Art. 23, All public and private educational institutions are underthe supervision of 
the state authorities. Teachers of public schools have the rights and duties of officers 
“of the state. j 
“Arr. 25, The means for establishing, maintaining, and extending the public-school 
system are furnished by the communities, and only in cases of inability the state fur- 
nishes the means.’’ [Note: The state in 1487 bore 18 per cent. of the cost of maintain- 
ing the public elementary schools, and about 34 per cent. of that of thesecondary schools. ] 
“ Rights acquired by private grantsin behalf of education shall be inviolate. The state 
guaranties public-school teachers a fixed income. Instruction in the public schools is

free of charge.’’ [This remained a good intention until October 1, 1888, when a law 
was passed enabling all communities, who so desired, to abolish tuition fees. ] 
“Apr, 26. A special school law regulates all educational efforts in the state. 
“Arr. 112. * * * and till the law mentioned in article 26 is passed, the former 
legal status, so far as it does not conflict with the constitution, shall remain in force.’’ 
[Note: It is significant that at present, forty years after the adoption of the constitution, 
this general school law has not been passed yet. Laws which partially cover the ground 
have been adopted, but substantially the public schools are still governed by the ‘‘Min- 
ister of Educational, Ecclesiastical, and Medical A ffairs.’’] . 
Since 1850 all the other states of Germany haye adopted compulsory attendance at 
school, and entered into treaties with Prussia, so that children living near the bound- 
aries may attend the nearest school. In the summer of 1890 the Prussian Diet passed 
a new compulsory-attendance law which is intended to do away with the many differ- 
ent provincial regulations in force. It reads as follows: | 
‘*1, Every child within the Kingdom of Prussia must follow the course of instruction 
laid down for the elementary (so-called public or people’s) schools. 
“2. Compulsory attendance begins with the term of admission following the com- 
pleted sixth year of life. Children who complete their sixth year within three months 
after this term may be admitted upon application of parents or guardians, provided they 
have the necessary bodily and mental maturity. 
*€3. Compulsory attendance ends with the close of the school term following the 
completed fourteenth year of life. Dismissal from the duty of attending school must 
take place twice a year. y 
‘4. The commencement of compulsory attendance may, for local causes, be postponed 
for a year by the supervising authority, and even for a longer period of time in individ- 
ual cases, such as insufficient physical or mental development. 
**5, Attendance upon religious instruction can only be enforced with regard to those 
children whose parents belong to the religion the dogmas of which are taught during 
school hours, 
“6, Children who are taught at any other public or private school, and the teaching 
at which is considered by the authorities to be equivalent to that at the elementary 
schools, are exempted from attendance at elementary schools. When this is not the case 
the inspectors have the right to enforce the attendance at the public schools. 
“7, Children staying away from school for no valid reason may be forced to attend 
by the proper authorities. f 
“8. The parents or guardians or employers must take care that the children attend 
school regularly. 
“*9, The school inspectors must inspect the rolls of attendance, and give notice to the 
police of the district in cases of unjustified absence from school. 
“10, For absence from school without valid reasons, the persons mentioned in clause 
8 shall be fined for each day of nonattendance from 10 pennies to 1 mark (23 cents to 25 
cents), or, where the fine is not immediately paid, with imprisonment of from three 
hours to one day. Instead of imprisonment, the persons convicted may work for the 
same number of hours for the benefit of the community, each according to his aptitudes, 
‘11, Employers allowing children to work during school hours, whether at the re- 
quest of their foreman or their workmen, shall be fined from 1 to 150 marks (25 cents 
to$37.50), or be imprisoned for, at most, fifteen days, unless the case falls within the 
terms of the factory !aw, and a severe punishment be inflicted, 
“12, The punishment shall be enforced in accordance with the law of April, 1883, on the infraction of police decree. The judge may inflict punishment on several per- 
‘sons at the same time, and notice of it may be given by a public functionary by word of 
mouth, Imprisonment for nonpayment of the fine may be resorted to before applica- 
tion for payment has been made, if the insolvency of the accused bas been proved at law. 
All fines paid for violating the compulsory-school attendance regulations are to be turned 
into the school fands, minus the cost of judicial process. 
“13. This law is to go into effect on the Ist day of October, 1890. The Minister of 
Worship, Education and Medical Affairs, the Minister of the Interior, and the Minister of 
Justice shall take the necessary steps towards its execution.’?

  CHAPTER XIX. 
STATE THXT-BOOK LAWS AND SYSTEMS. 
i!   
The following synopsis of State laws relating to text-books has in most cases been 
brought down to May, 1891. Only the most general features of the different laws have 
been considered, the provisions relating to free text-books for indigent children and 
those forbidding the use of sectarian text-books, which are common to nearly all the 
States and do not call for special mention, being omitted; the same has been the case 
with special provisions relating to cities. 
Considerable use has heen made of the valuable material upon this subject gathered 
py Hon. Oscar H. Cooper, State superintendent of Texas, and published in the Seventh 
. Biennial Texas School Report (1888-90), pp. XXVII-XLIV. 
‘There has been of late a widespread agitation in favor of cheaper text-books. The 
number of bills introduced in the legistures of the various States to effect this object 
has been unprecedented—in one case ‘at least four. These bills have generally been 
drawn up with a view to give the State control of contracts and prices, sometimes of 
selection or publication, systems much favored by legislators, though strongly opposed 
py most school officials and the educational press. Such bills as have become laws are 
noticed in this chapter,

ALABAMA, 4 
| 
Alabama has no law upon the subject of text-books, no statutory provision by which 
uniformity may be enforced and secured. ‘'The result is,’’ says Superintendent Pal- 
mer, ‘‘that every teacher is left free to select his own text-books, and where teachers 
change localities as often as they do in this State, the consequence isa continual change 
of text-books, to the annoyance and unnecessary expense of patrons. So frequent have 
been the demands for a change of text-books in many counties that the teachers and 
school officers have voluntarily adopted a series of text-books, agreeing to use them ex- 
clusively for a definite period, but for the want of some authority in the law to enforce 
such agreements, it amounts to very little advantage. The mere fact, however, that 
such efforts have been voluntarily made shows that there is just cause of complaint. 
The further fact also, that in all the cities and separate school districts where the local 
boards of education can control this subject, they have found it desirable to have a uni- 
formity of books, which they enforce by regulations applying to the schools under their 
control, is persuasive that some such authority should be given to the school authorities 
of the counties. I have heard general complaint upon this subject by parents through- 
out the State, and I am convinced that some authority of law should be given whereby 
uniformity of text-books may be secured in counties, if not for the entire State. 1 
“T believe that by judicious legislation upon this subject, hundreds of thousands of 
dollars now spent on account of the constant change of. text-books, might be saved to 
parents each year. Not only does this frequent change of text-books entail needless 
and irritating expense upon the patrons, put results in filling the schools with all kinds 
and editions of text-books, so that proper classification is impossible. Such legislation 
would enable the school officers to keep out of the public schools such text-books as are 
not in accord with our institutions, or are not calculated to inculcate the true theory of 
government and of the civil war. Without some authority of law this can not legally be 
done. . \ 
“T would suggest that the most feasible plan for securing this desirable object [county 
uniformity] would be a bill constituting county cominissioners or boards of revenue a 
commission to adopta series of school books for use in our public schools. I say county 
commissioners or boards of revenue, because they are already officers of the State, chosen 
py the people because of their fidelity and fitness for the important duties already in- 
trusted to them. The county superintendent of education should be a member of this { 
text-book commission.’?? _ 
ARKANSAS, 
Duty of the State superintendent.—The State superintendent ‘‘shall prepare, for the 
benefit of the common schools of the State, a list of text-books on orthography, reading 
in English, mental and written arithmetic, penmanship, English grammar, modern 
geography and history of the United States, as are best adapted to the wants of the 
jearner, and as have been prepared with reference to the most philosophical methods 
of teaching those branches, and shall recommend the said text-books to teachers and 
to directors throughout the State.’’? ; } 
District uniformily.— ‘The directors of each school district in this State shall adopt 
and cause to be used in the public schools, in their respective districts, one series of 
text-books in each branch or science taught in the public schools of their respective 
districts, and no change in these pooks shall be made for a period of three years, unless 
it be by a petition of a majority of the voters of the district desiring the change.’’* 
“Any person whose duty it is to execute this section, and who fails to do so, becomes 
liable to a fine of from ten to fifty dollars,” * | 
Objections to the law,—State Superintendent W. E. Thompson states that ‘in this 
State we have district adoption. ‘The adoption must be made by the board of directors © 
in each district from the list of books recommended by the State superintendent. ‘his 
law, in my opinion, fails in every particular. It can not give eyen county uniformity, 
Another objection is, the board is composed of ignorant men in many instances, who are 
easily influenced by book agents to make changes. I favor county adoption from a list 
of books recommended by a State board or State superintendent.: I have given this 
question much study, and my opinion is that county adoption and free books is the 
only solution of all the evils.”” 5 tay }

    “STATE TEXT-BOOK LAWS AND SYSTEMS. 5ST 
CALIFORNIA. 
Constitutional provision.—An amendment to the State constitution, adopted November 
4, 1884, made it the duty of the State board uf education to compile or cause to be com- 
piled a uniform series of text-books, to be used in all the schools of the State; and au- 
thorized the board to have them printed by the State printer and sold to pupils at cost, 
the books to continue in use not less than four years.' a 
Legisiation.—The acts of February 26, 1885, and March 15, 1887, provided for the 
compilation of thirteen text-books, by ‘‘ well qualified persons,”’ under the direction of 
the State board and the printing of them by the State printer. The board was directed 
to copyright them. When any book of the State series was compiled and adopted an 
order was to be issued requiring its use in all the schools, such order not to take effect 
until the expiration of one year from time of completion of the electrotype plates. 
According to the amendment of 1887, books may be ordered from the State superin- 
tendent by county superintendents, clerks of district school boards, and principals of 
State normal schools, all orders being accompanied with cash for the cost price at Sac- 
ramento and expense of transportation. Retail dealers are also permitted to order books 
upon making an affidavit not to sell them at a price exceeding that fixed by the State 
board, etc. 
County school boards were directed to provide a revolving fund. Appropriations 
from the State treasury were made for compiling the books, for the purchase of machin- 
ery and other material needed in their manufacture, and for paying the wages of com- 
positors, binders, ete.” ; 
Results, —State Superintendent Ira G. Hoitt, gives the following account of the results 
of the operation of the law up to July, 1890.* 
State teat-books, 
It is pow six years since our constitution was amended, making it the duty of the 
State board of education to compile a series of text-books for use in the schools of the 
State. ; 
The experiment was unique, and has{been attempted by no other State. The books 
were to continue in use not less than four years. This time will shortly have expired 
as regards the readers, which were ready for distribution in December, 1886, and the 
continuance of the scheme will be determined by the future actions of the legislature 
and of the various county boards in reference to a change. 
It school officers and the legislature shall decide to discontinue the use of the State 
books the experiment will have proved a costly one. 
The members of the State board of education, who have had. in charge the compila- 
tion of this series, have done their very best, under the provisions of the law, to make 
successful books. 
It is not to be denied that, in our isolation from the great literary and trade centers, 
this has sometimes been a task shadowed with many obstacles. 
The changes in the board that have occurred from time to time, the widely scattered 
residerices, and the heavy duties already devolved upon each member of the board and 
upon those employed to compile the books, haveall been obstacles in the way of aspeedier 
completion of the work. 
As was to be expected, the opposition from various sources has been strong and un- 
ceasing. But whether the system is continued or changed it does not alter the fact that 
the people should be protected in some legislative way from the extortion of book rings. 
In just what form this protection can best be given is difficult to determine. To my 
mind the free text-book sytem offers a full solution of the problem. * * * 
California has appropriated $315,000 for the manufacturing plant and for the first 
50,000 copies of each book, and also $35,000 for purposes of compilation. 
Since 1885, $255,054.42 have been expended for labor alone, and $25,644.20 for pur- 
poses of compilation, and $234,886, 48 have been received from sales for the same length 
of time, ending June 30, 1890. 
A certain proportion of the receipts is expected to pay for the plant in twelve years, 
but the total receipts form a revolving fund used by the State printer for manufacture 
of all editions after the first fifty thousand. 
The advantages of State publication are that it has relieved county boards of educa- tion from the solicitation of book agents; that it has reduced the prices of the books 
aon former rates, and that the money spent therefor has been retained in our own 
tate. .

The disadvantages claimed are: First, that it costs, the State more to manufacture the 
books than it would cost a private publishing house. This is true, because the State 
pays its employés a higher rate of wages and requires only eight hours of daily service; 
second, the lack of all competition in the authorship; third, the intrusting of the work o: 
supervision to a board whose members are already burdened with duties and which is 
subject to frequent changes. For instance, five changes have taken place in the mem~ 
bership of the State board of education in the last three and a half years; only one mem- 
ber of the board inaugurating the work now remains. oi , i

The following rules, which were at first adopted by the board for determining the cost 
of a book at Sacramento, have been continued in use: { 
1, Divide the cost of preparing the plates of a given book, including composition, engraving 
and electrotyping, by estimated supply of that book for twelve years. 1 
% Divide the share of the cost of the plant chargeable to a given book by the estimated supply 
for twelve years. stab { 
. Divide three-fifths of the cost of compilation by the estimated supply for four years. 
t. Divide the cost of the presswork, paper, and binding of a given edition by the number of that 
edition printed, , 
5. Taiko the sum of the preceding quotients and add one cent per copy for revision of text and 
one cent per copy for revision of plates. } : ;

a book of 512 pages, are here given: bi

Provision for completing the series, and for revision. 
In fixing the prices of the books issued, as has been seen, the board has provided for 
a self-sustaining series, and for relieving the general fund from further drafts for com- 
pilation and revision, Of the $35,000 appropriated to the use of the board, there re- 
mained on hand July 1, 1890, $9,335.80. In addition to this sum, all that is needed

is the use, from the proceeds of sales, of the one cent per copy which has been added ta 
the price of each book for that purpose. 
Process of distribution. 
The act of 1887, providing for the distribution of books through private dealers, has 
proved effective, and in most respects satisfactory. * 
The only friction arising has been in consequence of the prohibition to sell books to 
be sold again. This prohibition was imposed to prevent books getting into the hands 
of dealers not bound to sell at the price fixed by the board. In my judgment the prohi- 
bition should be removed if at the same time the selling of books by any one above 
the retail price fixed by the board is made a misdemeanor and punishable as such upon 
conviction. 
Publie satisfaction. 
For four years the scheme has had a fair and impartial trial. Every aid to its sue- 
cessful issue which this office could suggest or render has been given. ‘Ten books in all 
have been published during this time, and three more yet remain to be issued, two of 
which are nearly completed. So far as my observation goes, the favor with which the 
series has been received has been very much the same as that accorded to the books of 
private publishers. Many of the teachers throughout the State look upon the series 
with very general favor, while others have been less pronounced in their commendation 
and some have expressed severe and adverse criticisms. In the expressions of prefer- 
ence and criticism there is not much uniformity, some teachers preferring one book of 
the series and some another. Nearly all agree that the readers are poorly graded, that 
they should be revised, and at least one if not two more books should be added to the 
series, 
My conversations with teachers and superintendents in various parts of the Statelead 
me to the conclusion that with a few exceptions the books of the State series are giving’ 
as fair general satisfaction as the books previously in use, The mechanical work, at 
first bitterly complained of, is now generally conceded to be good. The character of 
this work may easily make a difference of 25 to 50 per cent. in the working life of such 
books. . 
The State publication of text-books in California has undoubtedly been one factor in 
causing the publishers of school books generally to reduce their prices, and there is not 
now so great a difference between the prices of our State series and those of private pub- 
lishers; it would even be possible for the State to purchase school books now at whole- 
sale for less prices than it costs to manufacture them at the State office, as may be seen 
by the following lists of present prices at which books are now sold:

          These are retail prices, and were the State to purchase in large quantities a discount 
from these figures of 33 per cent. could probably be obtained. 
As such an arrangement would entail an amendment to the constitution, it is not 
likely to be done very soon.

540 | EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
What the State printer says. 
The following is taken from a letter of Mr. J. D. Young, State printer, dated Novem- 
ber 25, 1890: | tie ‘ { 
«4s to the contents of the books I do not pretend to judge critically, but with the 
mechanical work I have something to do, and I know that in printing and binding, 
quality of cloth, leather, and board, our books are equal to any issued, while the paper 
is superior to most; for instance, we have been paying for that we used three-tenths of 
a cent more per pound than the price for which we could get the article used by the 
Appletons. We pay our compositors twenty-seven dollars per week; bookbinders and 
pressmen, twenty-four dollars per week; employ no apprentices, work but eight hours 
per day, and yet sell the .sckool books at a great reduction from the price previously 
charged by those engaged in the publishing business, and make a profit on each book 
Z which is held to pay, at the expiration of the twelve years the series is to run, the cost 
of plant, compilation, and manufacture of plates. 
“The books seem to give good satisfaction as a whole. Some people say that a cer- 
tain book is not equal in its compilation to others they have seen, and other people al- 
lege that the same book is excellent, but another one, pronounced superior by the first 
lot of critics, is not what it should be. It is probably the same with the books issued 
by private publishers.” 
i The foregoing would seem to be competent testimony as to the mechanical quality of 
the California State school books. 
Later views of the State Superintendent.—It will be seen by the following circular letter, 
dated December 26, 1890, that Superintendent Hoitt has finally reached the conclusion 
that State publication of text-books is unsuccessful: x 
Dear Str: In reply to your late inquiry concerning the publication of school text-books by the 
State of California, [ have had so many inquiries from your own and other States, that I have con- 
Sluded to make a xeneral statement in regard to the principal results of our experiment in State 
publication of text-books. For over four years this plan has had a fair and impartial trial in our State. I came into office 
a believer in the project, and every aid which I could give to its successful issue has been freely 
rendered throughout my administration. 
‘But now, in the light of my experience, I must acknowledge that the results have not met my 
expectations. i 
Tir the first place, the expense has been great, over $400,000 haying been appropriated thus far 
for the compilation of the series and the manufacture of the first 50,000 copies of each book. Ten 
books haveso far been issued and three more are yet to come to complete a full series as required 
by our law. ‘Whatever may be the advantages claimed for State publication by believers in a paternal plan 
‘of government, the result of the experiment in our State shows that it costs the State more to 
Shanufacture the books than it would cost a private publishing house, for obvious reasons. Be- 
sides this there is in a State series a lack of sponianeity and competition in authorship. 
‘When the State board employs an author or compiler it must accept and pay for his:work whether 
itis suitable or not. And the supervision and compilation of the series of schoolbooks by a State 
Board whose membership is subject to frequent changes and who are already burdened with other 
duties, is attended with difficulties. 7 
While our State board has been zealous and done the best it could in making a State series, I 
regret that its efforts have not met the requirements of the schools or the expectations of our lead- 
ing educators, as shown by the following resolution adopted at the Biennial Convention of Cali- 
fornia school superintendents, held December 2 and 3, 1890: 
* Resolved, That while certain of the State text.books, notably the ‘Primary Language Lessons’ 
and the ‘Blementary Geography,’ have met the approval of the public school teachers of the State, 
we desire to record our severe criticism and disapproval of others of the State series, and express 
Sur judgment that their thorough revision by competent authors, go as to adapt them to the wants 
Of the schools, is imperative, and should be entered upon at once.” 
‘In the light of our experience, after four years of trial, lam therefore compelled, with personal 
reluctance, to acknowledge to the comparative want of success in our California experiment in 
making and publishing schoolbooks. 
Taking into consideration the large appropriations made, and the further constant outlays for 
revisions, new plates, ete, the same number of books can be purchased in the open market at 
wholesale prices for less than it costs the State to manufacture them. 
Lam therefore constrained to admit that I would not advise any other State to enter upon the 
publication of school books. 
Very truly, yours, Ira G, Horrr, 
Superintendent of Public Instruction. 
COLORADO, 
District school boards are authorized and required to ‘fix the kind of text-books to 
‘pe used; provided, that but one kind of text-book of the same grade or branch of study 
shall be used in the same department of a school, and that after the adoption of any 
book, it shall not be changed in less than four years, unless the price thereof shall be 
unwarrantably advanced, or the mechanical quality lowered, or the supply stopped.’ 
‘Also to ‘‘furnish free text-books for the use of all pupils, when authorized to do so by ” 
a majority vote of the district, as expressed at any regular or special meeting.

STATE TEXT-BOOK LAWS AND SYSTEMS. _ 541 
Comments of State Superintendent L. S. Cornell.—‘‘ The last legislature amended the 
school law so as to permit school districts to purchase and own the text-books for the 
use of all the children in the schools. Quite a number of districts in the State have 
already availed themselves of this provision, andare well pleased with the results. In 
my opinion free text-books owned by the district is the only solution of the text-book 
probiem. The anxiety to have all the schools of the county or the State use the same 
books ceases when each district owns its own books,”’ 
CONNECTICUT. 
The provisions of the Connecticut law relating to text-books are as follows: 
Authority of State board.—‘‘ The board [of education] may direct what hooks shall be 
used in all its schools, but shall not direct any book to be changed oftener than once in 
five years,’? 
Physiology and hygiene.—‘‘ The State board of education shall prescribe the text-books 
to be used in teaching physiology and hygiene as required by law, and shall prepare or 
cause to be prepared a text-book, and if desirable, charts for such teaching, which text- 
books and charts shall be furnished to towns and school districts for the use of scholars 
in the public schools needing the same free of expense.”’ * 
Changes of text-books,—‘* No [town] board of school visitors or school committee shall 
change any text-book used in its public schools except by a two-thirds vote of all the 
members of the board or committee, notice of such intended change having been pre- 
viously given at a meeting of said board at least one week previous to such change.’’ * 
Free text-books permitted.—‘‘Any town at its annual town meeting may direct its school 
visitors or board of education or town committee to purchase, at the expense of said town, 
the text-books and other school supplies used in the public schools of said town, and 
said text-books and supplies shall be loaned to the pupils of said public schools free of 
charge, subject to such rules and regulations as the school visitors or the board of edu- 
cation or town committee may prescribe.’? > 
The secretary of the State board, Hon. Charles D. Hine, replied to the inquiries of 
Superintendent Cooper as follows: 
‘*T, The only system ever tried in this State is that of committing the selection of 
text-books to town boards. This has never been abandoned. 
“TI, The system above named is now in operation. The State board of education, 
however, has by law the power to regulate the selection of text-books. It never has 
exercised this power. 
The present system doubtless meets with public approval, because,efforts to overthrow 
it have never met with substantial encouragement. 
‘III. I can not tell you what system is best, because Iam notacquainted with many. 
“TV. In 1886 the State prescribed a text-book in physiology, and not only prescribed. 
the book but authorized the publication by the State board of education. A small text- 
book was prepared by the board and has been widely circulated in the State. The board, 
however, has never insisted that this book was exclusive, and has never interfered with > 
instruction in other books. 
“Vv. If your inquiries relate to the question whether text-books should be furnished 
by town or State, [ am not prepared to give youa full opinion upon thissubject. In our 
State free text-books would be of advantage insome places and of no advantage in others, 
My belief, however, is that the expense of text-books to the people would be very much 
decreased, as it ought to be, by the purchase ot books by the local authorities and sup- 
plying them at cost to families. The objection, of course, is that it permits abuse; yet 
there is no good thing which can not be perverted to improper ends.’?® 
DELAWARE. 
The following statement regarding the Delaware system was prepared by President 
A. N. Raub, of the State Board of Education, for State Superintendent Cooper, of Texas:7 
“T, The State purchased the books and furnished to local dealers as depositaries, to 
whom they allowed 10 per cent. for handling, Result, some dealers failed, some were 
dishonest, and many of the books became shelf-worn; and add to all this expenses of 
freight, etc., and the loss to the State became a very serious one. The plan was aban- 
doned two years ago. 
“TI, Pupils now purchase their books at the stores as they would purchase any other 
merchandise. This plan of course allows merchants to fix their own prices. Under the

former plan the prices were fixed by contract with the publishers. Books are adopted ~ 
every five years by the State Board of Education. | 
“TIT, In my opinion the best plan is to allow local districts, or at most eine to 
select their own series of books, and have the State authorize the purchase of these 
pooks by the local school boards, just as they would purchase any other supplies, and 
furnish the use of them free tothe pupil. When I began teaching in 1857 in the county 
of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, I found this plan pursued in the township in which I taught. 
It is still continued in the same township, and there has never been a particle of ob- 
jection urged against it. " ie 
“Under this system the right of individual pupils to purchase and keep their own 
books has always been conceded, but even these prefer to purchase of the school board, 
because the advance on first cost is very slight. If each district purchases and holds its 
own books, giving free use of the same toits pupils, the question of either State or county 
uniformity is a matter of little consequence.” i ! 
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 
The board of school trustees determines the text-books to be used in the public schools. 
Supt. W. B. Powell adduces the following considerations in favor of free text-books: 
~ “According to the rules of the board, text-books are now loaned to the children whose 
parents request the same. This request, however, is to be accompanied by a declara- 
tion that he who makes it is unable to furnish the text-books for Ris children. Many 
worthy persons, unfortunately situated, naturally dislike to make such statement or 
declaration. For this reason there is no doubt that many children are detained from 
school for weeks or months at a time, and that others are wholly deprived of the privi- 
leges of school, 
“Tt were folly to say that this need not be so. The condition exists; the children 
are not in school. They should be. Their education is demanded by the interests of 
the community. 
“Again, many children are withdrawn from school before they would be if their 
parents were able to furnish the books required by their advancement and promotion. 
A large number of children, therefore, get only a modicum of education. The interests 
of the State demand a broader learning and a more thorough disciplining than these 
children get. 
“Again, there is much waste to the community at large in the purchase of text-books 
py individuals, as many of these books are used but for a short time, and being of little 
or no value as library books, are destroyed or thrown aside, 
“To prevent this unnecessary outlay and, what is infinitely more important to the 
State, to insure a desirable minimum education of every child, I believe the State should 
furnish the text-books as well as the instruction, * * * 
“The American community is more interested to-day in having every child benefited 
by its schools than it is in having the character of its schools improved. Not how high 
shall we take our schools nor how broad shall we make our courses of instruction, but 
how may every child be reached and be made a safer and better member of the com- 
munity, is the problem to be solved, Any movement or instrumentality that reaches 
down ang uplifts will give yalue to tlie school system and compensation to the tax- 
payer.’?? 
GEORGIA. 
‘The county board of education shall prescribe, from time to time, what text-books 
and books of reference shall be used in the common schools of the county: Provided, 
That the Bible shall not be excluded from the common or public schools of the State: 
And: provided further, That when such text-books are prescribed, they shall not be 
changed for five years thereafter, except by a three-fourths vote of all the hoard: And 
provided further, That the county boards shall not be permitted to introduce. into the 
schools any text or miscellaneous book of a sectarian or sectional character, No teacher 
shall receive pay for any pupil who is allowed to use any other than the prescribed 
text-books,’?®   
1 Since the above was put in type, information has been received by the Bureau of the enact- 
ment of a law, to take effect the first Saturday of April, 1891, requiring the school boards of each 
school district to furnish text-books free to ali pupils. The books are to be paid for out of the 
funds appropriated by the State. 21D. O Sch. Rep., 1888-89, pp. 25-6. Congress) at its session of 1890-91, made an appropriation to

  STATE TEXT-BOOK LAWS AND SYSTEMS. BAS < 
State Supt. James 8. Hook says of the law: ‘I believe that our system for selecting 
text-books to be used in the schools, and which has obtained for several years in this 
State, is the very best known to me, We have no law of the State prescribing uniform 
text-books throughout the whole State. Section 23 of our school law is all the provis-, 
ion which the legislature of Georgia has thus far deemed it proper to make. It works 
well thus far, and is a special advantage to those counties where many of the patrons 
are poor, and frequent changes of text-books would bea great hardship upon them, 
The restrictions placed upon the board in that section are wise, judicious, and work 
well.??1 
IDAHO. 
County superintendents, with the concurrence of at least two county commissioners 
in each county, are required to adopt uniform text-books for the schools of the county, 
such books not to be changed for four years. They must invite proposals from publishers, 
accompanied by samples of all books offered, with a suitable guaranty as to maintain- 
ing quality and price. Superintendentsand commissioners are authorized to make such 
terms and conditions with the publishers as they may deem best for the interest of the 
counties concerned.” 
The school boards of independent districts are authorized to select the text-books to 
be used. They are not to be changed in less than three years, unless the price is un- 
warrantably advanced, quality lowered, or supply stopped.? 
‘A number of changes in text-books were made in many counties early in 1890, nearly 
all of them being satisfactory, so that little fault can now be found with the books in 
use and which can ‘not be changed until 1894. This provision is a wise one.’””—State 
Supt. Charles C, Stevenson.* 
ILLINOIS. 
District boards of directors determine the text-booksto be used in their respective dis- 
tricts, and are required to enforce uniformity. Books are notto be changed oftener than 
once in four years.® 
Every child buys his own book ‘whenever he can. ‘This method, says State Superin- 
tendent Edwards, ‘thas some mérits, but also some defects. It is difficult to say what 
method is the very best for supplying the pupilsin our schools with books. The method 
by which each !ocal board purchases the books for the school under its control and loans 
them to pupils has many adyocates.”’® 
INDIANA. f 
The Indiana act of March, 1889, constituted the State board of education a board of 
commissioners for the purpose of selecting or procuring the compilation of a series of text- 
books in spelling, reading, arithmetic, geography, English grammar, physiology, history 
of the United States, and-a graded series of writing hooks. The text-hooks selected by 
this board are to be equal in every respect to certain specified text-books in general use. 
The board is directed to advertise in Indiana, and in the cities of New York, Phila- 
delphia, Cincinnati, Chicago, and St. Louis, for proposals: First, from publishers of school 
text-books for furnishing books for a term of five years, each book being bid for sepa- 
rately; second, from authors of school text-books, who have manuscripts of books not 
published, for prices at which they will sell their manuscript and copyright; third, from 
persons who are willing to undertake the compilation of a book or series of books, giv- 
ing the price at which they are willing toundertake such compilation. Bids from pub- 
lishers .nust be accompanied by a bond for $50,000 to guaranty their fulfilling theircon- 
tract; and every bid must be accompanied byan affidavit that the bidder is not, directly 
or indirectly, connected with any other -publisher who is also bidding under the same 
advertisement, and is not a party to any compact, syndicate, or other scheme, whereby 
the benefits of competition are denied to the people of Indiana, 
The board is to make a full, complete, and thorough examination of all proposals, and. 
ascertain which it would be for the advantage of the Statetoaccept. But no book shall 
be accepted, or manuscript of a book, which shall be sold to patrons at a price exceed- 
ing the following, including cost of transportation and delivery to the several county 
superintendents:

Tf, upon examination of the proposals, the board is of the opinion that such books can be furnished cheaper to patrons by causing to be published the manuscript of any 
or all of the books, they shall ailvertise for proposals for publishing the same. It shail 
be stipulated in the contract with any successful bidder that he shall pay the compen- sation due to the author or owner of the manuscript, as agreed upon by the board; also, 
that the State of Indiana shall not be liable for any books, but that the contractorsshall 
receive their pay and compensation solely from the proceeds of the sale of books. 
As soon as any contract for furnishing text-books shall have been entered into, the 
governor is to issue his proclamation accordingly; school trustees shall then, within 
thirty days, certify to county superintendents the number of books needed for the pub- 
lie schools of their disricts; county superintendents make requisition upon the State su- 
perintendent, and the latter upon the contractor, for all books needed; the contractor 
must ship the hooks required direct to the county superintendents within ninety days. 
School trustees receive the books from the county superintendents, and furnish them on 
demand to school patrons or school children at the prices fixed upon in the contract, for 
cash only. 
Pupils of private schools, or any children between six and twenty-one years of age, or 
their parents, guardians, or teachers, have the right to purchase the books, at the same 
prices, of the county superintendents. 
The law also provides for the reports to be made by trustees and county superintend- 
ents, the bonds to be given by them, the mode of transmitting proceeds of sales of text- 
books, ete. 
‘Any trustee directly or indirectly demanding or receiving any money for any books 
in excess of the contract price shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be sub- 
ject to fine of not less than ten nor more than one hundred dollars, and imprisonmentin

IOWA. 
Law of 1890.—The following law relating to text-books is to take effect July 4, 1890: 
Section 1. The board of directors of each and every district township and independent district in the State of Iowa is hereby authorized and empowered to adopt text-books for the teaching of all branches that are now or may hereafter be authorized to be taught in the public schools of the State, and to contract for and buy said books and any and all other necessary school supplies at said contract prices, and to sell the same to the pupils of their respective districts at cost, and said money so received shall be returned to the contingent fund; that the books and supplies which are purchased under the provisions of this section shall be under the charge of the president of each board of directors; that he shall care therefor and receive all moneys for books sold, and he shall be responsible for all such booksand moneys, and heshall givea bond in the sum of five hun- dred dollars with sureties to be approved by the county board of supervisors to insure the faithful performance of such duties. i Sxc.2. All the books and other supplies, purchased under the provisions of thisact, shall be paid for out of the contingent fund, and the board of directors shall annually certify to the board of supervisors the additional amount necessary to levy for the contingent fund of said district to pay forsuch books and suppiies. Butsuch additional amount shall not exceed in any one year the sum of one dollar for each pupil residing in the district township or independent school district, and the amount so levied shall be paid out on warrants drawn for the payment of books and supplies only, but the district shall contract no debt for that purpose. SkO.3. In the purchasing of text-books it shall be the duty of the board of directors or the county board of education to tale into consideration the books then in use in the respective districts, and they may buy such additional number of said books as may from time to time become necessary to supply their schools, and they may arrange on equitable terms for exchange of books in use for new books adopted. , Sec.4, If at any time the publishers of such books as shall haye been adopted by any board of directors or county board of education shall neglect or refuse to furnish such books when ordered by said board in accordance with the provisions of this act, at the very lowest price, either contract or wholesale, that such books are furnished any other district or State board, or were furnished to any other district or State board in the'year 1889, then said board of directors or county board of education may, and it is hereby made their duty'to bring suit upon the bond given them by the contracting publisher, Src.5. Beipre purchasing text-books under the provieions of this act it shall be the duty of the board of directors or county board of education to advertise by publishing a notice for three con- secutive weeks in one or more newspapers published in the county; said notice shall state the time up to whigh all bids will be received, the classes and grades for which text-books and other

uitable text-books and supplies, at the lowest prices, taking into consideration the quality of ma- : srial used, illustrations, binding, and all other things that go to make upa desirable text-book, nd may, to the end that they may be fully advised, consult the county superintendent; or, in case j of city independent districts, with city superintendent or other competent persons, with reference ; to the selection of text-books: Provided, That the board may reject any and all bids or any part : thereof and readvertise therefor as above povided. 
SEc. 6. It shall be unlawful for any board of directors, or county board of education, exceptas - provided in section 4, to displace or change any text-book that has been regularly adopted and ntroduced under the provisions of this act, before the expiration of five years from the date of 
such adoption, unless authorized to do so by a majority of the electors present and voting at their regular annual meeting in March, due notice of said proposition to change or displace said text- books having been included in the notice for the said regular meeting. Z 
Sec. 7. Any person or firm desiring to furnish books or supplies under this act, in any county, i ik shall, at or before the time of filing his bid hereunder, deposit,in the office of the county auditor samples of all text-books included in this bid, accompanied with lists giving the lowest wholesale and contract price for the same. And said samples and lists shall remain in the county auditor’s 
oifice, and shall be delivered by him to his successor in office; and shall be kept by him in such safe and convenient manner as to be open atall times to the inspection of such school officers, school patrons, and school teachers as may desire to examine the same, and compare them with others, for the purpose of use in the public schools. The board of directors and county board of education mentioned shall require of any person or persons with whom they contract for furnish- ing any books or supplies to enter into a good and suflicient bond in such sum and with such con- \'tions and sureties as may be required by such board of directors or county board of education i ‘or the faithful performance of any such contract. ; 
Suc. 8, When a petition shall have been signed by one-half the school directors in any county, 
and the same shall have been filed in the office of the county superintendent of said county, at least thirty days before the annual school elections in March, asking for a uniform series of text-books : in the county, then the said county superintendent shall notify the county auditor and the board of supervisors of such petition. Such notice shall be in writing and shall be served or delivered as soon as possible, and within fifteen days after the filing of the petitions provided for herein the board of education, provided for in section 9, shall meet and provide for the. submission of the 
question ef county uniformity. * Sec. 9, The county superintendent, the county auditor, and the county board of supervisors shall 5 constitute a board of education, whose duty it shall be to arrange fora vote by the electors at the annual meeting in March, for or against county uniformity of school text-books under such rules ond regulations as said board of education may determine. Should a majority of the electors voting at such election, favor a uniform series of text-books for use insaid county, then the county i oard of education shall meet and select the school text-book for the entire county, and contract . 3 or the same under such rules and regulations as the said board of education may adopt. When a, f list has been so selected, they shall be used by all the publicschools of said districts, and the board of education may arrange for such depositories as they may deem best, and may pay for said school Ke ks out of the county fundsand sell them to the school districts at the same price as provided for in section 1 of this act, and the money received from said sales shall be returned to the county fonds by said board of education monthly.

       The Farmers’ Alliance and the Towa law. 
. The following is taken from the report of the Iowa State secretary of the Farmers? Alliance : 
““Many of the legislative demands made by the Alliance at its last annual meeting : 
have been enacted into laws. A joint rate bill has been passed, and also a bill relating 4 
© school text-books which has already been productive of much good. After maturely 
considering the various plans for school-bodk legislation, it would seem to be the part : 
of wisdom that the kind of instruction to be given to the children of the State and the 
selection of the text-books by means of which it is to be imparted should be kept where 
they can be carefully guarded by parents and the school officers, who are in closest con- 
tact with the school interests. The new law does this, and at the same time haseffected 
large savings in the cost.of text-books. As to the extent in the reduction in price, I Sy 
quote my own town, Moulton, where, by contracting under the new school law, we have 
effected a saving to the consumer of nearly 50 per cent. In Keosauqua, a town in the 
acighboring county, the saving to the consumer is 55 per cent. as compared with former

prices. Tho instances are given as examples of results such as more than 100 towns in 
Towa acting under the new law can show. ‘The simplicity of the plan in the law for 
securing county uniformity, combined with the purchase plan, furnishes a feasible 
method of carrying out the popular Alliance principle of codperation, the books for the 
entire county being thus bought in a bulk, and the advantages arising from such ‘pur- 
chase being distributed among the users of the books. If we are true to our own inter- 
ests, we can save hundreds of thousands of dollars in this State by availing ourselves of 
the cooperative power given us by this law, enacted, as I have said, largely owing to 
our efforts at the last legislature.”’ ¥

- County uniformity—Law of 1885.—Whenever a majority of the districts of a county 
indicate at their annual meetings their desire for county uniformity of text-books, the 
county superintendent is to call for one delegate from each township and city of the 
third class, such delegates to be chosen by the local school boards and organized into a 
county text-book board. It is made the duty of this board to prescribe the text- books 
to be used in all the public schools of the county, and when once adopted they are not 
to be changed for five years. Such books are the only legal text-books for the county, 
and school boards are required to adopt them, Cities of the first and second classes are 
exempt from these provisions, unless the school board of any such city votes to conform 
to them, in which case it is to be represented on the text-book board. Guarantees as 
to price, quality, and permanence of supply for five years are to be exacted from the 
publisher of every book before prescribing it.! P 
Penaliy.—A member of a school board violating the law is subject to fine or impris- 
onment, or both; any teacher violating the law is liable to immediate dismissal.” 
Result of the taw.—In 1890 over 40 counties out of a total of 106 had availed them- 
selves of the above law regarding county uniformity; 6 counties had readopted it for 
another 5 years. ‘The plan, where it has been followed, seems to have. been quite sat- 
isfactory. It is claimed that under this law there has been a saving of from 25 to 30 
per cent. in the cost of school books.’? * ; 
State Superintendent Winans is opposed to State uniformity, and believes that the 
adoption of it would work great injury to the cause of education. ‘‘My reasons,”’ he 
says, ‘and Iam not alonein my belief, are as follows: State uniformity would be certain 
to increase an already present tendency toroutine in the work of the schools. No single 
set of text-books would meet the requirements of so many different communities as there 
are in our State. State uniformity would necessitate the loss of all books now in use.’? 
He is also opposed to State publication and recommends free text-books,*    
      
    KENTUCKY, 
The State board of education is required, ‘‘from this time, to select and recommend 
% % % guitable lists of text-books for all thecommon schools of the State, from which 
lists the county superintendents of the various counties shall adopt the books to be 
used in their respective counties, which books shall not be changed oftener than once 
every five years: Provided, however, That in any district where a list of text-books has 
peen adopted and is now in use, no change in text-books shall be made in such district 
in a less time than fivé years from the time that list was adopted or until the books are 
worn out.’?> ‘

State teat-books.— ‘The State board [of education } shall strictly enforce a uniformity 
of text-books in all the public schools, and shall adopt a list thereof, which shall] remain 
unchanged for four years after such adoption. For satisfactory reasons shown to said 
board, it may change said list or adopt a list generally preferred by teachersand parents 
in certain localities, maintaining as far as possible a uniformity of text-books and with- 
out placing parents aud guardians to further expense. The adoption of such list and 
apparatus shall be by contract to the lowest bidder, subject to the change aforesaid, and 
to the best advantage as to cost to pupils.’”® 
Operation of the law.—State Superintendent Jos, A. Breaux reports that ‘in compli- 
ance with section 3 of the school law, the State board. of education adopted a list of

hooks to be used in the public schools. Contracts were entered into with publishing 
houses, and stipulations were made to have the books sold at the lowest masket 
prices. 
“The retail prices are as low as the retail prices of school books in any State of the 
Union. These prices are stamped on the books. The publishers have obligated them- 
selves (in the contract providing a SpoBAH for noncompliance) to sell them at the 
stamped prices. 
‘*The board endeavored to secure uniformity in text-books on terms the most ad- 
vantageous to the patrons of the schools. ‘To date, so far, the scheme to secure uni- 
formity in the useof books at reduced prices has proven satisfactory to those upon whom 
-devolve the expenses of purchasing them.’’*

reasonable time, they shall report the case to the assessors, who shall include in the next town tax jof the delinquent parent or guardian the value of the book or appliance so lost, destroyed, or in- 
ured, to be assessed and collected as other town taxes. ‘Your town having made appropriations for the carrying of this law into effect, it becomes your duty to take such action as its provisionsrequire. Youare to determine what books are to be used 
in your schools; to purchase the supply needed for the current school year; to contract for the future furnishing of such as may be needed from year to’ year; to make rules and regulations for their distribution to the schools, and for their care and preservation while in the hands of pupils and during vacations. To assist you, if I may, in this work, permit me to offer the following. sug- gestions: : 1. As to the selection of books.--That provision of law by which changes in text-books can not be made oftener than once in five years without vote of the town was not amended or repealed by the act of 1889 requiring towns to furnish books at public expense. Hence, unless your town at its Jate meeting voted to authorize you to make changes, you can do so only in case of series of books which have been used in town five years or more. Your first step, then, is to determine what changes can be made, and what, if any, it is desirable to make. Changes, however, should not be made save for very strong reasons. If the books in use in any branch of study are fairly satisfactory, 
they should be retained in use for awhile at least.” The reasson for retaining are twofold: (1) That pupils desiring to do so may be able to use their own books without being compelled to purchase new ones—the law does notcompelany pupil to use books furnished by the town, but does compel the town to supply all who wish to be supplied; (2) that books now in the hands of pupils, which are in good condition, may be purchased and made part of the town’s supply, If changes are deemed necessary, the new books should be selected with much care. ‘The points to be considered in selecting are, (1) excellence of text and adaptation to the ends of instruction; (2) mechanical qualities—whether firmly bound, of strong paper, and well printed; (3) price at which they will be furnished, both for first introduction and for a series of years. In the first of these particulars you will find less real difference between the later published books than pub- lishers’ agents will try tomake you believe. In the second you will find quite a difference, and that difference should be given considerable weight. Somewhat of difference in price, too, will be 
found, and of course should be given due consideration. As between several series of readery, spellers, arithmetics, and geographies which could be named, mechanical make-up and price should govern in selection. e {n order to make selections as above, you should apply direct to publishers or their agents for specimen copies of the books you desire to introduce, and for terms at which they will furnish 
them for first introduction and for continued supply. If you shall consider it of any assistance to you, I shall be prepared in a few weeks to send you, on application, a list of books in the common school branches, which I would advise you to examine before looking further. The books to be selected are, as a rule, to be uniform throughout the town. Such is the letter of the law. But in one case the spirit of the law may be observed, and yet its letter sacrificed to a higher good than that intended to be subserved by its literal observance. Wherever practicable it will be weli to have two or more series of readers in use at the same time, taling care that there shall be uniformity in classes. By rotation of use from term to term or year to year, pupils will, 
by this plan, have a larger amount of fresh reading matter than in case only one series be used, For instance, Harper’s may be used this term in one-half the schools and Butler’s in the other, and next term they can be changed about. The expense by this plan will be no more than if only one geries were used, as it will be necessary to purchase of each series only half enough to supply all the schools. 2. As to purchasing.—Having learned direct from publishers the prices at. which they will sell you their books, both those which you propose to retain in use and those which you propose to in- troduce, before yuu will be prepared to make purchases you will need to know very nearly how many books of each grade and sort you will berequired to supply yourschools. This youcanascer- 
tain with sufficient accuracy by requiring the teachers in your summer terms to furnish you lists 
of the number required in their several schools. 
Asalready intimated books in the possession of pupils, which are of the kinds you propose to 
have used, should be brought up and made a part of the town’sstock. Only such, however, as are in exgellent condition—as are sound, whole and clean—should be so purchased, You may assume, as the basis of price to be paid for these, that books, except of the lowest grades, which have been carefully used a year, are worth four-fifths as much as you will have to pay publishers for new ones of the same kind. One having been used two years would be worth two-fifths the price of a new one. So, also, books in the hands of the local dealer, if there be one, which are of the sort to be 
used, should be purchased at thesame price as you would have to pay publishers for them. What- ever numberadditional, after making these purchases, is necessary to complete the needed supply, should be ordered direct from the publishers. re, When newly introduced books are to be purchased, before purchase is made the publishersshould be required to enter into a contract fixing the price at which further supplies are to be furnished 
for a period of years, and giving assurance that the mechanical quality of the books will be main- tained. 
3. As to preparation for use.—The books haying been purchased, before they are ready for distri- 
bution to schools and pupils, they are to be labeled and numbered. On the inside of the cover should be pasted a label similar to that herewith sent, on which should be printed general rules for care of the books while in pupils’ hands, ete., and also the number of each book. ‘These numbers should run from one up to the number of books of each grade owned by the town. For instance, 
if 200 primary arithmetics are owned, and 150 advanced, the primaries would be numbered from 1 to 200 inclusive, and the advance from 1 to 150, These labels can be procured at a very moderate 
cost by applying to Burleigh and Flynt, State Printers, Augusta, or they can be printed at any local office. 4, As to distribution to schools and care during vacations,—In these regards methods in towns hav- ing no districts, and in those having the district syste, will differ somewhat. In the former it will be for the supervisor or committee to see that the necessary supply of books is at the school- 
house in possession of the teacher, and ready for use the first morning of the term. In every school- 
house should be a proper case or closet in which they can be stored under lock and key during vacations, and when not in use. Such receptacles are practicable when the town owns the school- 
houses, and they are under the charge and control of the committee or, some responsible party by them selected. Under the district system it will in many cases be impracticable to have proper re- 
ceptacles in which to store the books during vacations, and in all such cases they should be depos- ited at some central place of safety under the immediate control of the committee or their agent. 
Tn such eases the school district agent should be held responsible for seeing that the necessary sup- ply is atthe schoolhouse at the proper time, and also for the transportation of them, at the close of terms, to the central depository. This is ofie of the matters to govern which committees are 
to make regulations.

4, Because the work of the school can not be carried on promptly and efficiently un- 
less books can be furnished by the teacher on the day they are needed. A teacher wishes 
to begin a class in grammar. He tells them to bring the proper text-book on the next 
Monday. Monday comes, and only three pupils out of twelve have the book. The 
opening is postponed till the nextday, Next day brings four books, and the opening © 
is postponed till next week. Next week sees half the class furnished with books, and 
the teacher debates with himself whether to give up the class, or to goon with one-half, 
the members, or to give them another week to procure books. This is no feusy sketch, 
but a photograph from the life.

repeal the Jaw—so tar as his child is concerned—and set at naught the will of the ma-

rate than a private individual. Nearly one-halt of the present money expended on books 
might be saved by buying at wholesale; and the additional State tax would hardly be 
felt by the majority of those who patronize the schools. 
7. Because those communities that have tried the experiment of ‘‘ free books’”’ are 
perfectly satisfied and could not be induced to return to the old plan. 
8. Because the arguments used against free books are the very same as have been 
urged, and are urged, against free schools, ‘‘People do not value property what they 
have not paid for.’’ If I had a valuable horse given me bya friend, should I value him 
the less because he cost me nothing? Do we think theless of a broad and smooth high- 
way, hecause there is no tollgate on it?

MASSACHUSETTS. * 
Free teat-books.—Chapter 103 of the acts of 1884 provides that the school committee 
of every city and town shall purchase, at the expense of such city and town, text-books 
and other school supplies used in the public schools; and said text-books and supplies 
shall be loaned to the pupils of said public schools free of charge, subject to such rules 
and regulations as to care and custody as the school committee may prescribe. 
The “advantages of the free text-book system are: 
1. Economy in time and money. Under the present system’ the schools may be sup- 
plied, on the first day of the term, with all necessary means of study. This prevents 
the long delays that were formerly, experienced in organizing the classes, and enables 
the teacher to make a better classification of his school. Experience has proved that 
the expense of books and supplies, by the new method of purchase, is reduced nearly 
one-half. 
2. The new system furnishes a good occasion for training the children to take good 
care of those things not their own, but which they are allowed to use. 
3. It seems, by the returns, to have increased the attendance upon the schools more 
than 10 per cent. 
4, The public schools of the State are now literally free schools, offering to all, on the 
same free terms, the advantages of a good public-school education. 
Before the act of 1834 was passed, since 1873, sixteen towns in the State had volun- 
tarily adopted the free text-book system. In all cases the most satisfactory results 
followed.! 
Changes of schoolbooks.—A change may be made in the schoolbooks used in the, pub- 
lic schools in a town by a vote of two-thirds of the whole school committee thereof at 
a meeting of said committee, notice of such intended change having been given at a 
previous meeting.” 
Important results of the Massachusetts free teat-book law. —Massachusetts State board of 
education: The legislature of 1873 passed a permissive act granting authority to the 
cities and towns by ordinance or vote to supply the public schools swith all necessary 
text-books, which were to be the property of the towns, and to be lent to the pupils under 
such regulations as the school committees may make. A number of townsavailed them- 
selves of the privileges granted by the act. The results were so important and satisfac- 
tory that in 1884 an act was passed which provided that the school committee of every 
city and town shall purchase, at the expense of such city or town, text-books and other 
school supplies used in the publi¢ schools, to be loaned to the pupils free of charge,

7. The law to be executed by school districts under penalty of a forfeiture of school 
moneys payable to the districts. 
The administration of the law through district clerks having proved cumbersome, 
wasteful, and inefficient, in 1883 the law was amended providing for county agents to be 
appointed by the boards of county commissioners. The county superintendent has been 
required to make requisition for the entire county, and distribute supplies among the 
depositories. The agent has sold, books to pupils, and received a commission of 8 per 
cent, on all sales. This form of the law has continued and is still in force. * * 
In the administration of the law it appeared from the first that tie educational inter- 
ests of the youth had been partially sacrificed to a spirit of false economy, and text- 
books in most important branches had been placed upon the list that were unfit, and 
that were justly condemned by the good teachers of the State, For several years the 
children and teachers of our common schools had no relief. A merely technical revision 
of words and sentences would in no wise help the matter. The defects were radical in 
matter and method. The alternative presented itself whether these books should be ,. 
allowed to remain in the schools the entire fitteen years—two generations of common- 
school life—or the law be given a more liberal interpretation in the interest of education, 
and the old books revised out by entirely rewriting them. 
After a careful consideration and a full conterence with the county superintendents 
the latter course was adopted. This has given the State, with the exception of a single 
book or two, a good and serviceable series. In the operation of the law during these 
years the following results and characteristics have appeared: 
1, The selling price of books has been very appreciably reduced. This statement is 
to be taken together with the facts that (1) gratuitous or unpaid service is rendered by. 
the State department of education, the county superintendents, and county auditors; 
(2) a commission of 8 per cent. is paid by the county to the selling agent, and (3) a loss 
by the counties of various amounts, of books superseded by the revision or for other 
reasons unsold. 
. There have been whatever advantages come from uniformity in counties and the 
State, except that special and independent districts being exempted from the operation 
      ‘of the law, pupils of the country coming to these schools are obliged to purchase new 
books as before. 
3. The indefiniteness of the law as to revision, the addition of new books, and the 
prices which should be paid for them haye made it difficult to decide what course would 
best satist'y the State, and therefore have given opportunity for a difference in judgment 
as to the proper course to pursue. 
4, The duty required of the county superintendent to make requisition for the supply 
of books for the schools has been difficult and embarrassing. The law requires him to 
make an annual estimate and a single requisition for the entire county. It soon ap- 
peared that the superintendent had not the necessary data for a safe estimate, and many: 
Jarge and unwise orders were made at great expense to counties. Then followed the 
opposite extreme of making requisitions a8 agents gave notice of books needed. This re- 
sulted in multitudes of small orders on successive weeks and even days from the same 
superintendent. It increased the labor of the department beyond the ability of the 
clerical force provided, and greatly increased the cost of books in the added freight and 
expressage of the small parcels. 
Upon this the superintendents were requested to limit the number of their requisitions 
as much as possible, so that experience seems to have established the rule of quarterly 
or bimonthly requisitions. But while the county superintendent feels bound to provide 
books for the schools, he is subject to criticism by those who look only after the financial 
interests of the county for making, as they think, unnecessary orders for books, 
5. The administration of the law has been embarrassed by reason of a feeling, more or 
Jess prevalent, that the State has by its authority taken from the individual communities 
and teachers the privilege of selecting their own text-books. I think this feeling was 
aggravated by the unsatisfactory character of the books first placed on the list, and with _ 
the revision to an acceptable series this feeling has not been wholly dispelled. 
And now for the future, this being a financial as well as an educational problem, I con- 
sider it wholly within the province of the people who pay for schoolbooks to devise from 
the financial standpoint their own best way to furnish them, with this kept clearly in 
mind, that the end for which all this expense is incurred is the education of our youth, 
and therefore that no scheme should be considered which forbids teachers and youth 
the use of as good books as the market affords. 
Assuming that the present contract will terminate in 1892, it will devolve upon the, 
coming legislature to make proper regulations for a supply of good text-hooks at fair 
prices after the expiration of the present contract. The imperative need of some kind 
of State regulation in the supply of common-school books is: (1) Because of the large 
pecuniary interests involved, the expense in the State being about $200,000 annually;
-P-A-G-E-626
     
     
Bea. Ss DUCATTION REPORT, 1888-80. 
  (2) Those who pay for the books never select them, From the nature of the casé, this 
devolves upon. persons who have, or are presumed to have, expert skill, viz, teachers, “a 
ay superintendents, and school boards. (3) These large quantities of books must be dis- 
tributed among the individual consumers, scattered over hills and prairies, to the re- 
i _ motest corners of the State. if an { 
‘As a resultof these three conditions, competition for patronage is great, and the strong- 
est influences possible are brought to bear upon those in authority to make changes that 
» often are not pee and to no one’s permanent advantage but the party getting the 
patronage. Besides this, there is the additional expense of distribution through the 
usual channels of tra 
This is rather ‘a financial thanan educational problem. _ Good booksare abundant. The 
teachers of our youth are only interested in this, that the State make provision for the 
supply of its children from the list of good and approved books, and,not, by its limita- 
tion of prices, compel them to use inferior, hooks. ‘ 
Bote Ours is a Staie public-school system. TheState provides in part for the cost of instruc- 
ie tion of its youth, and directs how the remaining expense shall be equally distributed. 
Tt confers upon local boards all the authority they exercise for the management o! their 
local affairs. It is certainly as important that the State should exercise all necessary 
authority for the proper supply in so important a matter as text-hooks for the use of its 
schools. WN 
The plans which have een’ adopted are various, each of which serves a purpose. Of 
these I mention the following: 
4. The supply of books by the State, as in Minnesota, California, and Indiana. 
2. The selection of books by the districts in open market, and the purchase by pupils, 
provided that no change of books be made in less than three or five years. 
3. The purchase of books by the district in open market, and the sale or rental of 
them to pupils. This plan is confined to individual districts, usually cities, and insti- 
tutions. t ‘ 
4, The purchase of books by the district and the use of them as a part of the neces- 
sary apparatus of the school, ‘This is known as the ‘‘ free text-book system,’ and has 
- heen adopted by the States of Massachsetts and New Hampshire, and is made optional to 
districts in Wisconsin and a few other States. < 
{am still of the opinion, as presented in my report of 1886, that no method so entirely 
meets the demands of both financial and educational interests as that of “‘free text- 
books. ”” 
From the financial side, purchases are made direct from the publishers and at lowest 
rates. The experience of other States and of many cities has been that the cost per pu- 
pil is reduced to about forty cents, so that the average cost to a district of fifty pupils 
would average about twenty dollars annually. 
From the educational side there appear the following advantages: 
1. There is absolute uniformity for the district, which is all the uniformity that is 
necessary, the books being a part of the apparatus of the school. 
2. The books ate ready for all the pupils at the opening of the school. This is a great 
, gain. It isno uncommon thing for days and even weeks of the short term of a country’ 
school to be made almost useless because children have no books. 
3. By this plan pupils can be put into classes best suited to them. 
4, The attendance is much increased. It is not uncommon for parents of large but 
_ poor families to keep their children at home because they do not feel able to equip them 
with the necessary books. - { ‘ 
In the execution of this plan provision must be made by which teachers will be held 
strictly responsible to the district for the care of books, and exact reports made by dis- 
trict officers of the condition and cost of the text-book library. N

Two free text-book bills were before the Minnesota legislature in 1891, 
MISSISSIPPI. ‘ 
County ‘uniformily.—An act approved. February 22, 1890, requires each county school 
board to appoint every fiith year a committee of teachers of recognized ability, who are 
to select a uniform series of text-books for the county. These committees are to obtain 
from the leading schoolbook publishers samples of their text-books and price lists for. 
exchange, introduction, and permanent supply, and from these select one text-book for 
each branch required by law to be taught in the public schools. The books so selected 
must be used in the public schools of the county for five years from the date of their 
adoption. The list adopted for each county must be published in some newspaper four 
consecutive weeks. The county superintendent is required to exter into written con- 
tract with the publishers. It is made unlawful to give instruction in any branch toa 
pupil who is not supplied with the proper text-books in that branch. 
In towns. —In towns which are separate school districts it is made incumbent on the 
local school board to adopt for each town a uniform series of text-books, to be continued 
in. use four years, and to contract for the same with the publishers. 
Text-books in history.—The State superintendent, governor, and attorney general are 
~ ‘constituted a committee to examine and recommend text-books in United States his- 
tory, to the end that such may be excluded trom the publieschools, as are ‘* biased, prej- 
udiced, and unfair,’’ or ‘that suppress iull, free, and candid presentations of questions 
and principles upon which the American people have been honestly divided, and in the 
maintenance of which they have acted according to the promptings of courage and 
honor.?? 
MISSOURI. 
There is no State law relating to text-books. The adoption and change of books are 
left entirely with the local school boards. 
Various bills have been introduced into the General Assembly providing for State 
control of text-books, or a commission to prepare, publish, and distribute text-books, 
and sell them at the actual cost. State Superintendent W. E. Coleman is strongly op- 
posed to any such action. He says that ‘‘ this is simply a craze that is going through the 
States and is destined to rebound with tremendous torce in a few years, and that to the 
‘detriment of the schools of the State that tries it.’”? ‘State adoption of text-books is 
simply a gigantic monopoly susceptible of jobs, fraud, and-corruption. No State will

MONTANA. 
Statetext-books.—An act approved March 5, 1889, prescribed a specified series of text- 
books for exclusive use in the schools of Montana for six years. ‘Che act was not to 
take effect until the publishers of the books named had filed their bonds to observe 
certain conditions as to the supply of books to dealets and school boards, especially for 
introduction and exchange during the first year of the operation of the law, to main- 
tain certain named prices and standard of excellence, and to provide a special map and 
text relating to Montana in the geography adopted. Provision was made for posting 
the authorized prices in each school room, and county superintendents were to keep 
themselves informed as to whether the prices were actually maintained. — 
Any district noncomplying with the law forfeits one-fourth of its county school fund. 
‘All school officers and teachers are charged with the execution of the law.” 
Opinion of State uperintendent John Gannon: “<7 believe in a uniform series of books 
for use in the State, as children are continually changing residence, and expense of books 
for use in public schools is reduced to a minimum. * * Our present series meets 
asa whole with popular approval.’?®

State Superintendent Lane writes as follows of the former law:* ‘The only law that 
weever had and the one nowin use gives very general satisfaction. Its provisions allow 
each and every local board to select the books to be used in the schools under their charge 
and to purchase books in job lots ‘and furnish the same free of cost to pupils. Theschool-

school officers, and vote upon the amount of tax they will levy upon themselves for the 
purpose of purchasing books and supplies for the schools. When no Jevy is noted at the 
annual district meeting for books, ete., then the board can not buy books for the pupils, 
but each pupil must provide for himself. Ithink this plan is the best of all plans in 
vogue.” y 
In 1886, out of 4,667 districts, 432 purchased text-books; in 1888, out of 5,664 dis- 
tricts 713 purchased text-books. 
The new law; free books compulsory upon all school boards.—By an act which takes effect 
August 1, 1891, all district boards are required to purchase all the text-books and sup- 
plies necessary for their schools, and to loan them to public school pupils free of charge; 
they are further authorized to enter into contract with the publishers of such books, for 
a term of years not exceeding five, under the usual ‘‘lowest price’ limitation. The 
contract must be made directly with those publishers only who file bonds with the State 
superintendent.? 
Nebraska is thus the fifth State to adopt compulsory free text-books, the other four 
being Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, and Delaware. 
NEVADA. Pi 
’ 
The following statement is made by State Superintendent W. C. Dovey: ? 
“The law of Nevada provides that the State board of education shall adopt a uni- 
form series of text-books for all the public schools inthe State, to be changed not oftener 
than once in four years. -* * * I think ours the best system, for the following 
reasons: 
‘1. Greater uniformity in the work throughout the State. : 
‘9. Easier adaptation of one course of study in the several counties. 
‘¢3. It minimizes the injurious effects of the transfer of pupils from district to dis- 
trict and from lower-grade schools to high schools, etc. 
“4, It tends to raise the standard of education by establishing greater uniformity 
in grades and promotions, and brings the common schools into closer relationship to the 
higher institutions of learning. 
“5, It tends to facilitate unity and harmony of State, county, and city supervision 
as members of one system. 
‘6, Itisa great aid to teachers, especially those of limited experience, who often 
must change districts or counties. 
‘7, It is a measure of economy to parents and pupils in the less frequent purchase 
of new books. ‘ 
‘*8. It prevents the annoyance and confusion resulting from the frequent changes in 
text-books that may be made by local boards. 
‘*9. It protects parents, teachers, and school boards against the incessant annoyances 
of book agents and publishing firms. 
“10. It gives greater confidence to the public and all interested in education, 
“11. It shields school boards from the temptation to commit fraud, removes doubt 
and suspicion from their action, and restrains the fickle or fraudulent teacher who finds 
all new books superior to the old ones, if flattered or feed by the agent. 
‘12. Better terms can be made with publishing houses for supplying a whole State 
for four years than can be by districts for an uncertain period. 
“The argument that State boards may be disbonest or ignorant can be made with 
equal force against local boards, with a reasonable certainty that this danger is equally 
liable to be multiplied in proportion to the number of local boards in the State.’? 
The law applies only to ‘‘text-books in the principal studies pursued in the public 
schools, to wit, spelling, reading, grammar, arithmetic, geography, and physiology.’

School district boards of trustees are directed, in connection with the county super- 
intendent, to prescribe a uniforn series of text-books to be used in the school or schools 
under their charge.. They must require all children to be furnished with suitable books, 
as.a condition of membership in the school,* { 
t ‘Text-books are furnished free in 179 out of 1,379 country districts, and in 20 out of 
80 cities; 1,258 country districts have uniform text-books, and 121 no unilormity.®

Text-books, how designated.—The school authorities of cities, villages, and union free- 
school districts are required to adopy and designate text-books to be used in the schools 
under their charge. In other districts text-books are designated‘ by a two-thirds vote 
of the voters at a school meeting.® 
Change of tewt-books.—No change of any book so adopted shall be made for five years, 
except by a vote of three-fourths of the local board of education, or of the district 
meeting.’ ft ‘ i 
Several of the cities of the State have adopted the free text-book system. StateSuper- | 
intendent A. S. Draper says that ‘‘so far as this system has been tried, the expression of 
sentiment seems to be strongly in its favor.”%) 4 
: ‘Superintendent Charles W. Cole, of Albany, in recommending free text-books for that 
. } city, calls attention to the following special advantages offered by them: 
“The purchase of all books by the local authorities would tend to the use of the very 
best books only. Under the presentsystem members of boards of control very naturally 
\ hesitate to order any change in text-books which would inyolve a considerable expense 
to the parents, and very often au inferior book is kept in use almost entirely from the 
reluctance of bourds to create this additional tax upon those who must purchase the 
- pooks. If the books were free, purchases could be made without direct tax upon any- 
t body, and as a result the latest and most approved books and editions would be slways 
in use. fe \ 
“The plan of furnishing all needed books would also enable the board to enlarge the 
scope of the text-book work, by furnishing different series of readers and similar books 
for use in all the grades. The importance of this plan has been felt for many years, but 
has not been carried into execution because the board did not feel it could ask the par- 
ents to buy so many different books, and it would have been difficult to convince the 
ee ~ local authorities of the necessity of providing these books at public expense.’’®

State Superintendent S. M. Finger discusses the question as follows:* ‘‘The books 
recommended by the State board of education, which are required by statute to be used 
in all the public schools of the State, are now largely used in the country schools. The 
histories, geographies, and arithmetics are almost exclusively used, and the others are 
rapidly going in, so that the State is almost uniformed, and much money is'saved the 
children by the use of these books. 
‘More than one-half of our list in value is published by the University Publishing - 
Company, and about one-fourth (the arithmetics) by the J. B. Lippincott Company. 
These books are all of Southern authorship, as are also our North Carolina histories, pub- 
lished by, A. Williams & Co., and our United States histories. These are all good 
books, and free from anything objectionable to our people. 
‘*One of the most serious questions that confronts the South is the character of school- 
books. The book houses are making a great fight over the introduction of books, some 
of them going so far as to make combinations, or syndicates, or trusts, and to offer to 
swap even for all old books, and, indirectly, if not directly, to use money to control the. 
judgment and action of school boards and teachers. If our Southern people are wise 
they will look carefully after the books that are put into the hands of their children. 
**So far as the distribution of the books is concerned, our law contemplates that each 
child shall own his books. I believe this is better than any other plan that can be 
adopted. ‘Che possession of a book causes the child to take better care of it, and really 
to take more interest in studying it than he would if it were lent to him by the school 
committee for the term, or distributed daily in’ the schoolroom from a common stock. 
Besides, there are other objections to the promiscuous use of books by different children, 
connected with their health and cleanliness. 
“Tt might be well for the statute to allow committees to donate books in the elemen- 
tary branches to a few children that, in their judgment, are not able to purchase them, 
but I would go no further.”

The Territorial law Data bed district boards, ‘‘if they deem it advisable, to purchase 
class and text-books and stationery and other necessary articles required by pupils in 
their school work, and sell bing rent them to the pupils in the SeROo|s under their con- 
trol and mana; ement.”? 
This provision was omitted from the new State law, so that it is doubtful whether it is — 
in force. State Superintendent W. J. Clapp recommends that it be reénacted aud 
discretion given to school boards to furnish free text-books.! e 
A bill is before the legislature (1891) providing for a State contract with publishers 
for a uniform series of text-books, to be furnished free to pupils by districts.    OHIO. 
Views of the State school commissioner.—Hon. John Hancock, State school commissioner, 
under date of March 24, 1890, and previous to the enactment of the law given below, 
wrote as follows to State Superintendent Cooper, of Texas: 
“We have never hath but one system of school text-books in Ohio. The question of 
what text-books shall be used in the schools of the State is left exclusively to the school 
boards of the several districts. The pupils obtain these books from book dealers, or 
from the boards, which are authorized to purchase from the publishers direct and sell 
to the pupils t cost. Until quite recently this plan seems to have met the wishes of 
the people, barring a chronic grumbling as to price. Within afew years many bills 
have been introduced into our legislature to involve the State toa greater or less degree 
in publishing text-books or purchasing and selling them, or both. But such bills have 
not as yet suceeeded in getting themselves made into laws. Our whole school system 
is based on thé autonomy of the district, and any scheme that undertakes to take from 
the district board the choice of text-books to be used in the schools of that board will 
be sure to meet with decided opposition. 
‘*T do not know that there is any better system than our own in our country. If 
that were to be abandoned I suspect that free books, to be selected by the local school 
boards and distributed under their direction would come nearer meeting the views of 
the people than any other, though I do not think they are ready for such a step yet. 
‘«There are now four different bills involving State control, to a degree at least, over 
this text-book matter in the legislature. What will be the outcome of it no one can 
say. 
y As you may infer, I now believe in leaving the whole question to the school boards; 
but I am studying the question of free books. I have as yet a theory of social’ stience 
that stands very stubbornly against my yielding to this plan. I believe the State should 
      
» do nothing for the citizen that he can do for himself. The opposite theory, as I look at 
the matter, tends toward the patriarchal system of government and socialism, to which 
I am opposed.??? + 
The new Ohio law.—The following is a synopsis of the Ohio law, passed April 28, 1890: 
The governor of Ohio, State school commissioner, supervisor ofpublic printing, and 
two other persons to be appointed by the governor, are constituted the ‘‘Schoolbook 
Board.’ This board is to fix a maximum price at which each of the text-books now in 
use and each ew text-book may be sold to district boards of education by publishers, 
said price not ““exeeed 80 per cent. of the present lowest price thereof, at which such 
book is now sold by the publishers thereof to dealers.” 
Publishers are to be invited to submit proposals for furnishing these text-books for 
periods of five years, the prices not to exceed those so fixed by the board. If these offers 
are found by the board to be satisfactory they are to accept them and enter into con- 
tract with th proposers accordingly. 
The State commissioner is then to furnish each board of education throughout the 
State with a list containing the name of each text-book contracted for, publisher, price, 
etc. Each district board is to determine what text-books from the list it shall adopt, 
such books not to be changed for five years without a three-fourths vote of all the mem- 
ches are to be taught in the English language. Boards of education are 
$ direct from publishers, and make arrangements tor their distribution 
to pupils, the #xpense of such distribution not to exceed 10 per cent. of the cost price; 
and the books are to be sold-to pupils at the price paid the publisher and not exceeding

10 per cent. thereof added. It is the duty of boards to secure books below the maxi- 
mum price if possible. They may contract with local retail dealers to furnish books at 
prices specified, such dealers becoming responsible to the publishers for all books pur- 
chased by them. 
Tn case no satisfactory proposals are submitted by publishers on the basis designated 
the board is to advertise for proposals to be received not later than six months after the 
passage of the act as follows: 
First. From publishers of schoolbooks for furnishing books for five years under the 
same price limitations as before. Each bid was to be accompanied by a bond in the 
sum of $10,000 to secure the bidder’s entering into a contract if his bid should be suc- 
cessful. , 
Second. From authors of schoolbooks for their manuscripts and copyright. 
Third. From persons who are willing to undertake the compilation ofa book or books, 
or series of books, giving prices for the same with details. 
The board is then to report to the adjourned session of the general assembly their 
bids, together with a statement of number and kinds of books necessary to supply the 
schools of the State, itemized cost of printing them, ete. ’ : 
Report of the Ohio Schoolbook board to the general assembly. 
| From a report of the schoolbook board, made January 20, 1891, it appears that in 
compliance with the foregoing law the “State commissioner of common schools sent 
out, May 1, 1890, a request to schoolbook publishers for copies of all the books pub- 
lished by them used in the public schools of the State, and that these copies be accom- 
panied by a statement of the lowest wholesale price of the same, Thirty-seven pub- 
lishing firms complied with this request. All these firms expressed a willingness to 
bid under the provisions of the law on the condition that the maximum limitation of 
price fixed by the law wasto be understood as meaning 80 per cent. of the lowest whole- 
sale list price.’’ 
After consulting with the attorney-general and members of the legislative commit- 
tees on common schools, the board came to the decision that it was ‘‘authorized by the 
act to contract for schoolbooks at 80 per cent. of the lowest price at which the book is 
sold to dealers by the publishers, and not 80 per cent. of the lowest price at which the 
» book is listed to the dealers by the publishers.’’ . 
“As it was not possible to ascertain the lowest price for which a book may sometimes 
be sold to a particular dealer in the State, the board agreed that a deduction of 16% per 
cent. from the publishers’ wholesale list prices would fairly represent the net prices to 
dealers, thus requiring an aggregate reduction of 33} per cent. from publishers’ whole- 
sale prices. This, of course, fixed the maximum limitation at which the board could 
receive bids at 66% per cent. of the publishers’ list prices. The publishers who had sub- 
mitted books were immediately notified of this action, and, with a single exception, 
they respectfully declined to bid, on the ground, as stated by themselves, that with 
sueh a reduction in price they could not maintain the quality and excellence of their 
several publications and afford themselves a reasonable profit in their business,”’ 
Such proposals as were received were not accepted by the board. It accordingly be- 
came incumbent on them, under the terms of the law, to advertise for proposals under 
the same restrictions as to price as before. But it was apparent to the board that the 
matter was now in that respect ‘‘in precisely the same condition it was in when bids 
were called for the first time, and as publishers would be required, in addition to their 
bidding under the old price limitation, to give bonds to accompany their bids under 
most uncertain conditions, it was concluded by the board that it would be useless, and 
an unnecessary expense, to advertise, asking bids from them a second time. And in 
view of the fact that a report was to be made to the general assembly the board did 
not consider it advisable to invite proposals from authors in regard to manuscripts or 
copyrights for the reason that such propositions could only be tentative and could not, 
before the meeting of the legislature, secure any practical results.’’ 
After narrating the results of State publication in California the report goes on to say: 
“In the adoption of schoolbooks two things should be considered—cheapness and 
excellence. All will agree that the latter should never be sacrificed to the former, for it 
is greatly more important that a book should be good than that it should be cheap. Of 
course the two qualities should be combined as far as practicable. But the question 
remains whether State authorship and State publication is the best way of securing such 
aunion. A good text-book isa thing of growth. The wisest of men have again and 
again made serious mistakes in their efforts to make text-books, even in their own 
specialties, and their productions have fallen stillborn from the press. The final test 
of a text-book is its use in the schoolroom. To purchase the manuscript of a book 
with the unavoidable uncertainty as to what its practical merits may prove to be, adopt

schools exclusively for a series of years, whether they itor not, or whether it proves a 
success or not, seems neither in conlormity with the spirit of our institutions nor with

boards are directly responsible to the people who elect them. We are contident, there-

the selection of the text-books to be used in their respective schools; and this for the 
reason that books well adapted to the wants, of one community may be far from the 
pest for a community differently situated.” 
“The board estimates in detail the cost of a new and complete outfit of books in the 
common branches,on the basis of furnishing them to pupils at 20 per cent. discount 
from publishers’ wholesale list prices with 10 per cent. added for expense of carriage 
and distribution. The total foots up to $1,023,330, ' 
“The whole number of pupils enrolled in the schools last year was 797,439. Of these, 
36,492 mere cares in the high schools, leaving the enrollment in the elementary 
schools 760,947. 16 will be seen, therefore, that the average cost per pupil in these ele- 
mentary schools for a new and complete outfit of books would be $1.35. 
“Tf we add to the books mentioned those used in the high schools, we may assume 
that we will be within the mark in saying that the schoolbooks in the: hands of the 
youth of the State have cost, at the retail prices paid for them, $1,250,000. Any law 
or plan, therefore, which would necessitate a complete change of school books through- 
out the ea ‘and would displace satisfactory books to the above amount would require 
about a million dollars’ worth of books to replace them, thus entailing an aggregate ex- 
pense upon the people of over $2,000,000 in a single year. In the advocacy of a law 
' involving such a change lexislators will of course take into consideration whether, in 
supplying schoolbooks under its provisions, even for a long term of years, the saving 
would counterbulance the direct and immediate loss. 
“Of course whep a complete outfit of books is once in the hands of pupils these books 
are not all renewed each year—prohably on the average not one-third of them. Accord- 
ing to the statement of the supply agent for the St. Louis public schools the cost of 
books purchased by the pupils enrolled in. the elementary schools of that city for the 
year ending July 1, 1890, was a trifle over 37 cents per pupil. From this statement of 
facts we think we shall be warranted in saying that upon the price standard taken for 
our estimates (80 per cent. of the publishers’ wholesale list prices) the average cost a 
year per pupil in the elementary schools will come within 40 cents, or a little over 
$300,000 a year for all the pupils in that class of schools.’? 
‘The time for carrying the law into execution.—So ra‘lical were the changes contempla- 
ted by the law as to the adoption, purchase, and distribution of schoolbooks, that the 
time givenin which to make these changes was totally inalequate for the purpose. If 
satisfactory bids had been received by the board, it would not have been possible to have 
had the adopted books placed in the hands of pupils at the opening of the schools in 
September. And as it would work disastrously to the interests of the schools to intro- 
duce new text-books at any other time than the beginning of the school year, another 
ear should have been give for carrying out the objects of the law. 
The limitation for hiding. —‘The experience of the board indicates that the maximum 
schoolbooks as fixed by the law was too low. If that limitation 
had been 80 per cent. of the lowest wholesale list price, the board had assurance every 
schoolbook firm in the country was prepared to bid. But, as has already been stated, 
when this limit was brought down to 33} per cent. below the wholesale list price, these 
firms, with the one exception, declined to bid. 
He Suggestions. —No other State than ours has included high school text-books withinits 
plan for securing cheap schoolbooks, Such a high order of talent is essential to the 
production of this class of books, and comparatively sé few of them areus od, that ithas 
heretofore been deemed wise to leave their adoption to the unrestricted choice of boards 
of education. But if Ohio should deem it well to depart from this universal precedent— 
and it is the opinion of this board that some limitation of price is desirable—it might 
be well to consider whether, in fixing this limitation of price on high-school books, it 
should not be somewhat higher than on the text-books in the common branches. 
‘And if the general assembly should determine to continue the plan sought to be 
carried into effect by the law of last winter’s session, it is further suggested, whether, 
for the sake of definiteness, it would not be better that the bids by publishers should be 
based on their wholesale list prices, which can always be readily known by the public. 
, “Tt isalso suggested whether, if the schoolbook board should tail to obtain satisfac- 
tory bids on a full series of books, the board should not be empowered to submit partial 
lists to boards of education for adoption, limitation of price for

“‘Nothwithstanding the board has found it impossible, for reasons set forth in this 
report, tocarry into execution the provisions of the schoolbook iaw, it is believed this 
law has not been altogether without value. We are convinced it has been an influential 
agency in enabling the people to procure schoolbooks at a considerable reduction in 
_ price, many publishers now agreeing to contract with boards of education to furnish 
these books at a reduction of 20 per cent. below wholesale list prices.”

Exclusive of the cost of authotship, compilation, and illustrative desiens, 
In making the foregoing statement of the cost of publishing a certain number of school text- pooks equal in kind and quality to those adopted as a standard of comparison and caleulation, I have endeavored to make conservative and reasonable estimates. In doing this itis proper to understand that the manufacture of schoolbooks is asepara'e and distinct branch of the publish- ing business, and involves many special processes and details, the exact cost of which it is difficult to obtain and calculate. It is comparatively easy to estimate the ordinary mechanical cost of making a schoolbook, in- cluding such items as presswork, materials,and binding. But these are really not the most im- 
portant or expensive factors in corree:ly estimating the total cost of publishing any given number of schoolbooks. It is the preparatory work before a single copy of a schoolbook can be printed that requires the larzest outlay of time and money as well as the most skill and experience. When the manuscript of a Schoolbook proposed for publication has been duly prepared and arranged, the matter must be set up in type, and the type used in the composition of a schoolbook must be 
especially cast for that purpose, as it must represent the diacritical marks and technical signs or eharacters required in teaching. And schoolbooks as now made are embellished with eopious illustrations, and histories and geographies must contain full and accurate maps, These must all be drawn by competent artists or expert cartographers, and after certain processes must be en- 
graved by other skilled artists. All this work requires peculiar talent aud sixill and constitutes a large part of the expense of making scho lbooks. ‘The composition and preparatory work for printing a schoolbook requires the most careful and pai:.staking proofreading, and often whole pages must be recast, This editorial supervision and proofreading is no small item of expense. After the text of a schooibook is set up, its pages of composed and corrected type are then electro- typed. These electrotype plates must bein duplicate, called “ pattern plates” and “running plates,” and five or more distinct plates, called “ color plates,” are required for printing maps, These plates must continually be kept in good condition and be frequently renewed, it being considered desir- able to renew the plates of any schootbook after printing 100,000 copies, 
After the work of preparing plates of the text, maps, and illustrations of a schoolbook, it is then 
ready to be printed. The printing of a schoolbook, especially those containing illustrations and maps, requires skilled labor and particular care. Maps must be run through the press as many times as there are colors to be printed in the map. When the printed sheets come from the press they pass through several different stages or processes, each one requiring separite manipulation by the hands of skilled labor, Indeed, it is labor, professional, skilled, and artistic, and not the 
materials or mechanical processes which constitutes the largest part of the cost of publishing school- 
book: 
In view of these facts, which I have found in my experience and from my investigation of the, 
subject during the past year to be true, I have endeavored to make safe and reasonable estimates

The State superintendent is required every sixth year, under the direction of the State 
board of education, to procure proposals from the publishers of text-books, and submit 
a listof such books, with their prices, to State examiners and county superintendents 
for their votes. The books or series of books in each branch receiving a majority of all 
the votes must be adopted for all the public schools of the State fora period of six years. 
Publishers of the books selected must file bond to fulfill agreements, and must place a 
card in each schoolhouse showing the prices of books. 
Any district failing to introduce the authorized State books forfeits its proportion of 
theschool fund. School boards of districts having a school population of 1,000 or more, 
however, are authorized to select books for the high school only. 
Provision is made for taking a special vote when any book or series in use is sup- 
plied at an unreasonably high price, or is found to be excelled by more recent pub- 
lications, or for any good or sufficient cause.! 
State Superintendent E. B. McElroy says: ‘‘ This system is satisfactory to the public 
generally, so farasI know. My opinionis that county uniformity would perhaps meet 
all demands best.’’? 
PENNSYLVANIA. 
Adoption of teat-books.—The school board of each district (i. e., in:general of each 
township, borough, or city) is required to select annually, in consultation with the 
teachers, a series of text-books in the different branches to be taught during the ensuing 
school year.’ A majority vote of the whole board is necessary to decide upon any series 
of books.* No book or series of books may be changed oftener than once in three 
years. 
Free text-books authorized.—School boards are permitted to purchase text-books out of 
the public funds and furnish them free to pupils.° ‘‘This plan is entirely satisfactory 
where it has been adopied, and is growing in favor throughout the State,’’ writes Deputy 
State Superintendent John I. Stewart,’

with books by parents or gual rdians; and in case they are not so supplied trustees shall 
provide them out of the distri st school funds and make out a tax bill for the cost thereof 
against the parents who have neglected to furnish them.* : 
Uniformity.—The State commissioner is directed to ‘‘ recommend and bring about, as 
far as practicable, a uniformity of text-books in the schools of all the towns.’’ 
FR Changes. —Changes may be made in the schoolbooks of any town: by a vote of two- 
thirds of the whole school committee (in Providence a majority). No change may be 
made in any text-book, however, oftener than once in three years, unless by,consent of 
the (State) board of education.° 
' Woonsocket and Bristol furnish text-books free to pupils. 
: State School Commissioner Thomas B. Stockwell writes of the text-book system of 
Rhode Island as follows: , 
‘Rhode Island has never had but one system, that is that of compelling the pupils 
or their parents to furnish their own books, save in cases of extreme inability, when the 
town or district is authorized to supply them. The decision as to what text-books 
shall be used is wholly in the hands of each town or city school committee or school 
- board. ‘ want j : 
: “So far as the determination of what pooks shall be used, I do not know but that the 
d be devised. The only demand I find that really 
exists among the people is for a uniform series of text-books for the whole State; but 
the only reason ever given is that when families move from one town to another they 
need not be compelled to buy new sets of books. Seldom, if ever, dol bear any com- 
plaint about the books as such. . 
“Tam in most hearty accord with the Massachusetts plan of having each town and 
city determine its own books and then furnish them free to the pupils. Gn the first 
point, I believe that competition will make and will keep very nearly all the books 
equal in merit; at least the differences between books of nearly the same age are seldom 
great enough to make much difference in their value. What one lacks in one direction 
it is very apt to possess in another, T have never seen the ‘best’ book yet in any line. 
I believe such a plan leaves ip business in the shape least likely to give rise to jobbery 
and hostile criticism, and most likely to furnish the schools at all times with the most 
valuable and desirable books. 
ie “The second point provides the factor in securing the child’s education that is too 
often wanting, and that often prevents its acquisition, It is the ‘missing link’ in the 
system. When you have provided schoolhouses, desks, blackboards, and teachers, all 
you need to complete the equipment is the books, and then you can go ahead. 
“TJ have watched the development of this question during the past fifteen years, and I 
am very clear that no system of State uniformity or even county uniformity by contract 
for a term of years or State publication is of advantage. Somebody undoubtedly gets 
rich harvests out of such schemes, but the schools are not the fortunate parties.” + plan works as well as any that coul

The law.—The State superintendent “‘shall secure, by and with the advice of the State 
board of examiners, uniformity in the use of text-books throughout the free public 
schools of the State, and shall forbid the use of sectarian 'or partisan books and instruc- 
tion in said schools.’?® ‘The State board of examiners is authorized ‘‘ to prescribe and 
‘ to enforce, as far as practicable, the use of a uniform series of text-books in the free

Operation of the law.—According to State Superintendent James H. Rice, in a letter to 
| State Superintendent Cooper, of ‘Texas, “the State board of examiners adopts a uni- 
form series of text-books for use in the’public schools. For ten years, from the estab- 
lishment of the board a multiple list of books was adopted, and the teachers were 
allowed to select therefrom books for use in their schools. This plan was found to 
work badly, for the reason that whenever there was a change of teachers a corresponding 
change of books was inevi abie, thus putting parents to great and unnecessary expense, 
At the last adoption, therefore, a change was made, and the plan set forth in the in.

‘A resolution by the State board of ewaminers lo secure uniformity and prevent needless changes in the ‘use of textbooks in the public schools of South Carolina,? J 
Resolved, That the peculiar condition of affairs in this State, by reason of which, not only in each county, but in each school district, there are teachers and pupils of different Classes and races, possessing different cupacities to teach, learn, and purchase books, it would be injurious to educa tional interests to adopt a single list of text-books for the State. ‘That, in order to secure flexibility in the system, and to meet the varying wants of the schools, and, at the same time, to prevent frequent changes in text-books in a school, which impose vex- atious and unnecessary expense upon parents, the State board of examiners hereby adopts the following rules and regulations to govern the use of text-books in the public schools of the State: The list of text-books to be adopted by the State board for use in the public schools shall be elective in character. On or before Thursday, October 25, 1888, the county board of examiners in each county shall, from said State list, adopt'a single series for use in the public schools of their respective counties, 
  provided that upon application from the teacher and trustees of any school, within thirty days - 
after said county adoption, or thirty days after the establishment of any new school, on good and 
sufficient reasons being shown, the county board may allow the substitution in said school of any 
other book on the same subject from the list adopted by the State board, cy ‘ 
A series once adopted shall not be changed during the period of adoption by the State board 
without permission from the said board. This shall not, however, prevent the use in schools where 
the same may be needed, by and with the consent of the county board of examiners, of two series of readers on the State list to be used alternately, or of proper supplemental reading. The series 
somted shall be putin force according to the commencement of the schools, not Jater than the fall 
° . All resolutions by the county board of examiners pertaining to the adoption of text-books shall 
be recorded by the county school commissioner in a book kept by him for the purpose, and copies of the same forwarded by him, within thirty days, to the office. of the State superintendent of education. , Any teacher who, while receiving public-school funds, uses text-books in the course of study prescribed for public schools that are not on the State list, shall forfeit his pay from the publie- 
school fund for the time he used them. Any teacher may refuse to teach any pupil who is not sup- plied with the text-books preseribed for said school. Pupils passing from one school to another must conform to the list adopted for the latter, 
The trustees, or, in their default, the county board of examiners, shall enforce these provisions. 
‘The county school commissioners shall withhold approval of pay certificate of any teacher not con- 
forming thereto; and the teacher persisting in violating the same shall be deprived of his certificate 
of qualification. It is advisable that there be adopted, as far as possible, the same books for schools of the same 
class and grade within the county, in order to secure, as far as practicable, county uniformity. It shall be the duty of the county school commissioner to report to the State board any attempt 
on the part of any publishing house, whose books are on the State list, to induceany change from the list regularly adopted for any scuool. 
As these provisions are in the interest of economy, parents are requested to codperate in secur- ing their enforcement.

County superintendents are required to keep themselves ‘‘informed as to the merits 
of text-books and to suggest to the district directors such changes as may from time to 
time be advisable, with a view to securing uniformity in the course of study through- 
out the county, when it can be done without increased expense to the parent,’?® 
TEXAS. 
In the absence of any statutory provisions regulating text-books, State Superintendent 
Cooper has instructed school trustees as follows: - 
“Tt is the right and duty of each board of trustees to prescribe the text-books which 
shall be used in the district or community under their control. This duty requires 
much care, When books have been adopted they should not be changed without strong 
and evident reasons for change. Trustees have the right to exclude from the schoolsall 
books not prescribed by them for use in the schools.’’ 
Under these instructions, trustees’ have been called together in county meetings in 
several counties and have adopted books for the county, pledging themselves to ratify 
in their several boards the action of the county convention of trustees. So far as the 
State superintendent has been able to ascertain, this course has given excellent satisfac- 
tion. x 
Mr. Cooper sums up his examination of the question as follows: \ y 
“A careful study of this text-book question leads me to the conclusion that its final 
solution will be free text-books, that is to say, the school authorities of each school dis- 
trict will be authorized or required to purchase the books from the district school funds

answerable. It Ke been tersely and conclusively stated by Mr. Wickershamas follows: 
‘To make a school free you must make all free that belongs to it. _ To the school be- 
longs the house, the furniture, a teacher to impart instruction, and suitable apparatus 
to aid him in the task. In the same category must be placed text-books, for they are 
the necessary tools with which the teacher works. A freeschool, therefore, implies free 
text-books as well aga free schoolhouse, free school furniture and apparatus, and free 
tuition. From the standpoint of a free-school system, no line can be drawn that will 
place text-books on one side to be purchased by private individuals, and all else belong- 
ing to the school on the other, to be bought and paidfor by the public. The pupil needs 
a book with which to prepare his lessons about as much as he does a seat to sit upon or 
a map or blackboard to aid him in his studies. The principle upon which free-school 
systems are based absolutely demands free text-books. The logic of the case is without 
a break.’ i 
“Texas is not yet ready, however, for a general law providing free text-books. A permissive law authorizing city school boards and the school boards of districts that levy 
local taxes and are supplied with adequate schoolhouse facilities to provide text-books 
from the public funds is practicable. Beginnings have been made in this direction by several cities in this State without any law. Houston furnishes supplementary readers 
or all grades where they are used, and many cities furnish school supplies of various 
inds. ‘ 
“‘The best law that could be passed at present in this State would be one requiring 
district school boards to adopt books for a period of not less than three years, and au- 
thorizing school boards of districts that levy local taxes to buy books to belong to the 
district and be supplied to the children according to their needs. A law of this kind 
will offer no ptateastiie to the inevitable transition to the free text-book or library sys- | 
tem, which is superior in economy and efficiency to any other system’?! : ea tt ae f

text-books in the studies preseribed by law is prohibited. County boards must enter into contract with the publishers of the books selected, while the chairmen of such 
boards are directed to arrange with one or more persons in each town to keep for sale the authorized text-books, who shall receive on the sale thereof not more than the freight 
and express charges and 10 per cent. advance upon the contract price.” 
Books on physiology, ete.—Text-books on physiology and hygiene must be furnished to 
all pupils at the expense of the State until July 1, 1895.? 
Free text-books authorized.—Any town or district may purchase and hold text-books 
for use in its schools, if it so votes in a meeting warned for that purpose.* 
Views of the superintendent.—State Superintendent E. F, Palmer is of the opinion that text-books should be furnished free, and that the State should assume the entire expense 
of supplying them, as long as there is’ no State tax. ‘‘ Equal taxation, economy, the 
highest success of the schools, and experience of other communities all concur in de- manding not only free schoolhouses, but free text-books for the children of the State. The reason for insisting that the State, instead of the towns or school districts, should 
furnish the text-books is that it would tend to a more perfect equalization of taxes. 
“It would be more convenient for the towns to furnish the text-books, and would be 
preferable, if a State school tax is imposed by the legislature, as recommended in an- 
other part of this report.e 
Some districts are refusing or neglecting to use the new books, but as there is no pen- alty attached to using prohibited books, the superintendent does not see how the courts could impose forfeiture of wages or of school funds. * 
‘ VIRGINIA. 
The law.—‘‘ Uniformity of text-books * * * shall be provided for on some gradual system by the board of edueation.’’® 
Regulations of the State board of edueation.—County school boards are required to select text-books from a list prescribed by the State board, but are forbidden to adopt more than one book of the same grade in any branch (which gives county uniformity). Provision

is made for an advisory committee of teachers in each county to recommend books to 
the county board for adoption. The State board contracts with publishers to supply » 
the books for 4 years, and the county boards arrange with the publishers for their in- 
troduction at contract prices. 
As soon as any county board has determined upon the books to be used for a term of 
4 years, due public notice is to be given of the names, prices, and mode of obtaining 
the books, and of the regulations of the State board requiring every pupil to be sup- 
plied with the proper books before admission into any public school.* 
In cities. —City school boards are authorized by law to adopt other text-books than 
those contained in the State lists for schools above the primary grade; and the school 
boards of Richmond, Petersburg, and Norfolk may adopt other text-books for primary 
schools with the consent of the State board.? 
New construction of the law.—The recently appointed State superintendent, Hon. John 
E. Massey, discusses the subject as follows:* ‘‘The school law of Virginia provides for 
the adoption of text-books by the State board of education, and has been construed by 
some of my predecessors to authorize an open list of two or more series in each depart- 
ment, leaving it for county boards to select trom books adopted by the State board at ) 
their own discretion, and providing only for a county uniformity in one of the adopted se- 
ries, and that system is at present in operation. My own decision, however, is that the 
law requires the one book list, and I think our board will adopt the one book list and 
enforce its use, because it is clearly, in my judgment, the meaning of thelaw. * * * 
“‘T ama firm believer in home rule and government by the people, and when legisla- 
tion has provided them the adoption of a uniform series of text-books by the unit or- 
ganization, leaving it for local boards to contract for the best books on the best terms, 
the legislature has accomplished its full mission in this respect. * * * 
“So far as my knowledge extends, education is most. progressive, teachers are most 
enthusiastic, and the people most generally satisfied where there is flexibility and free- 
dom. in the selection of text-books. I would not therefore advocate State uniformity, 
but I would advocate county and local uniformity. I would not advocate State con- 
tract, but I would advocate local contract, and would throw the door wide open for free 
competition to all.”’ 
WASHINGTON. 
Slate series of text-books.—The State board of education is empowered to adopt a uni- 
form series of text-books for use in all thecommon schools including the graded schools. 
Before making any adoption, the State superintendent is required to advertise for pro- 
posals, the advertisements naming all the kinds of books for the supply of which pro- 
posalsare invited, and stating also the exchange, wholesale, and retail prices that are to 
be maintained. The exchange price is not to exceed two-fifths of the contract retail 
price of the books in use. The books adopted are not to be changed within five years.* 
Any district using other than the State books forfeits one-fourth of its State school ap- 
portionment.® Boards of education in cities of more than 10,000 inhabitants may pre- 
scribe text-books in addition to the State series.® . 
The law requiring uniform text-books throughout Washington has been in force for 
many years. StateSuperintendent RK. B. Bryanstates thatit ‘‘ has given very general satis- 
faction, so much so that our legislature, which has just adjourned, readopted it as a part 
of our Statecode. * * * I think no better system could be adopted for our use 
than the one referred to. We are new; there is much immigration and changing from 
place to place, and will be for some years, so that State uniformity is certainly desira- 
ble.” : 
WEST VIRGINIA. 
A certain specified series of text-books, uniform throughout the State, was adopted 
by act of legislature in 1870. A few changes have since been made.’ 
In 1879 an act was passed regulating the prices of the text-books. This act made it 
the duty of the State superintendent to contract with the publishers of the State text- 
books that the books should be sold to the pupils and patrons of the schools at a special 
retail price, not to exceed the lowest wholesale price at any time, and to any State. firm, 
or person; and that they should be furnished to dealers at 16% per cent. discount from 
such special retail price. The contract retail price of each book was to be printed on ~

where books were sold. Any dealer charging more than the contract price became sub- 
ject to a fine, District school boards are authorized, by an amendment ot 1885, to pur-’ 
chase and keep on hand a supply of books for sale to patrons and pupils.’ 
in as follows:? ‘‘ We have never the outside of it, and pri 
  State Superintendent B. §. Morgan remarks upon the 1 
known any othersystem of sup lying the schools with class books than what is understood 
as State adoption and uniformity. This system has been modified to this extent, that a 
number of our largest towns which have been allowed the privilege of selecting their 
own schoolbooks, for which the State makes the contract with the publishers. Since 
1879 the State has by law contracted through the State superintendent for all public 
schoolbooks, and fixed the maximum prices at which these books shall be purchased 
from the publisher and sold by the retail dealers to the people throughout theState. This 
system gives our people uniform books at a uniform price. 
«This system just deseribed is at the present time in operation in this State, and in 
my judgment gives very reasonable satisfaction, The obstacles in the way of making 
it entirely satisfactory are that in remote sections of the State the per cent. of profit to 
retail dealers does not offer sufficient inducement to handle the books, and so the people 
do not always find a convenient supply at hand. When these obstacles are removed 
and some other changes made, I believe our system will render almost entire satisfac- 
tion. ji i f 
“T am not prepared to say just what is the best system pursued in the United States, 
as Iam not familiar with the plans adopted in all the other States. The essentials to 
be aimed at in any system are, first, the best books; second, the lowest price at which 
they can be supplied to the people; third, a system by which the people can obtain 
these books with the least trouble and inconvenience. ‘ 
Tt seems to me that State adoption and uniformity, thus offering a large business 
to publishers, should secure the minimum price for books. I believe the best method. 
of distributing the books is by means of the retail merchants of the towns and coun- 
try. also think the State should regulate the retail prices to the people.’ 
‘And the State superintendent further says in his own report:? ‘‘ The present contract 
for supplying schoolbooks to be used in the public schools of this State will expire in 
1890, Having taken special pains to inquire into the different plans in practice in other 
States, and in cities, for supplying books to patrons and pupils, I am convinced that no 
one with which I am familiar is more advantageous and economical for the people, and 
petter calculated to secure protection from all imposition by way of excessive charges. 
T therefore most earnestly urge its continuance. Should merchants fail or refuse to 
keep on hand a sufficient ‘supply of books for the schools in their vicinity, on account 
of the rate of profit allowed, as has perhaps occurred in a few cases, and which has 
_peen urged as an objection to the law, boards of education are empowered by law to 
purchase and keep on hand in the office of the secretary of the board a supply of 
schoolbooks for the pupils of the district. This law will prevent any failure in secur- 
ing the necessary supply of schoolbooks, and very conyeniently supplements the pres- 
‘ent plan of securing schoolbooks. 
»  Asto the schoolbooks now adopted for usein the public schools of the State, they are 
among the best published, and, so far as I am informed, are giving very general satis- 
faction. Greatcare should be used in the selection of text-books, but when good books 
have once been adopted and introduced into the schools it is very unwise to make fre- 
quent changes, not only ae account of the confusion produced in the schools, but also 
- on account of the great and needless expense to patrons and pupils. It should also be 
_ understood that it is far pire difficult and expensive to eftect a change of schoolbooks 
in country schools than in city schools, Isee no need for any change of schoolbooks 
adopted and now in use in this State.’” ' 
Opposition of the governor to renewal of the contract.—Governor E.W. Wilson sent to the 
legislature January 28, 1890, a special message protesting against a renewal of the con- 
tract which was to expire in 1890. He commended favorably the new Indiana law (see

*No contract. 
“Here then [he went on to say] is the fact that we are paying over 35 per cent. more 
for the books named than the State of Indiana is paying for books of a like character, 
as good in every way as ours; and we are assured by the manager of the Indiana house 
that the same books can be furnished to us at the same prices. 
‘*T have secured a complete set of the Indiana books for your examination and com- 
parison with those now in use in this State, and they amount to a demonstration of the 
extortion that has been practiced upon our people under cover of an unwise law which 
compels the exclusive use ofa particular series of books, and annihilates all competition. 
‘*Tf the legislature fail to act in this matter at the present session then the State 
superintendent of free schools wiil be compelled to enter into a five-year SOREL for 
the books named in section 58 [of the school law]. * * * 
“Ts it possible for the law to subserve the interests of monopoly more soinplesie? 
Can such laws be justified upon any principle or reason whatever? I have no special 
series of books to recommend. The law should not name the books. Let there be a 
competent commission appointed who shall advertise and receive proposals from pub- 
lishers, authors, and others, and, when the proposals are all in, if satisfactory books be 
presented, select.and adopt a series for this State, within maximum prices to be fixed _ 
by the statute. * * * 
‘No argument, no sophistry can justify a continuance of the present obnoxious, op- 
pressive monopolistic laws which, unwittingly, have been fastened upon the people, and 
which compel them to pay from 35 to 50 per cent. more for schoolbooks than they are 
reasonably worth.’? 
It appears that the schoolbook contract was finally renewed for one year from 1890, 
WISCONSIN. 
District boards determine text-books to be used, and must keep a list thereof posted 
in the schoolhouse. | When once adopted they are not to be changed for three years, and 
not then unless authorized by a vote of the district ata regular meeting; notice that the 
question of a change of text-books will be submitted must be embodied in the call for 
the meeting. In cities analogous provisions are in force, any change of text-books being 
subject to the approval of the common council or board of aldermen.* 
Any district may by vote authorize its school board ‘‘to purchase books, and loan 
them to pupils for a stipulated rental per month, term, or year, or sell them to pupils at 
cost or more, or furnish them for use without charge.” . 
Free text-books.—A law of 1887 requires every school district to vote, at each annual 
meeting after its passage, upon the question, of providing free text-books for pupils, and 
levying a tax to meet the ee

FURTHER OPINIONS ON THE TEX'T-BOOK QUESTION. 
| 
The solution of the text-book pr: blem. —Superintendent L. S. Cornell, of Colorado: The 
solution of this problem, I believe, will be found in free text-books owned by the local 
boards. When this plan has been adopted the question of uniformity is no longer dis- 
cussed. Its advantages are that it secures absolute uniformity within the school, that 
it opens the doors of the school to the very poor, and that it is the most, economical 
method of supplying the children with books. 
It'secures uniformity. Whehever it is decided thata certain kind of book is needed, a 
sufficient supply for the whole school is purchased. ‘There is. no waiting until parents 
find it convenient or can afford to buy. All are equally weil supplied, rich and poor 
alike. Many a child now remains out of school uniil late in the term, or does not at- 
tend at all, because his parents really can not afford to purchase the necessary books, or 
think that they can not. With books supplied, the school becomes indeed free. 
Tt is the most economical. The books are bought in large quantities at wholesale or 
publishers’ prices. Each book is used again and again until it is worn out. It is the 
general testimony that books owned by the school are better cared for and last longer 
than those belonging to the pupils. If books are adopted for a term of three or four 
years many of them would last through the entire time instead of being laid aside or 
Gestroyed after a few weeks’ service, as is often the case when they are owned by the 
individuals. } 
Again, this plan gives a free field to private enterprise and competition. If an edu- 
cator has written a book that he regards as superior to those in use, and has founda 
publisher, he has every opportunity to secure its adoption and have it tested. Orif a 
publisher is enterprising he can make his books artistic and attractive in appearance, 
assured that he will be rewarded by larger sales. This freedom of competition will in- 
sure progressively better and cheaper books. j 
I would insist, then, on these three things: First. That the selection of text-books 
should be left entirely in the hands of thelocal authorities. Second. ‘That when a book 
is once adopted it should not be changed in less than three or four years. Third. That 
the books should be owned by the school and furnished free of expense to all pupils.’ 
"Free text-books not a charity.—Superintendent Thomas Tash, of Portland, Me.: The 
objection has been raised that the State may as well relieve parents by requiring towns 
and cities to furnish the clothing of school children as to furnish text-books in the schools. 
One making this objection deserves to have lived among the ancient Spartans, where 
the objection could hardly haye been raised. Such an objecter evidently looks upon 
the free school as a magnificent charity, and not asa political necessity. Text-books are 
a necessity to common-school ¢ducation which the State, for her own preservation and 
welfare, has undertaken to supply; clothing is a necessity to the individual’s physical 
welfare, over which the State has not yet assumed full control. 
The State imposes upon municipalities the duty of raising taxes to defray the expenses 
of procuring lots, erecting and repairing schoolhouses, providing school furniture and 
fuel, and furnishing suitable instruction. The right and wisdom of the State thus to 
provide for the education of her citizens is beyond question; it is, therefore, not only a 
proper but a wise economy to add to these expenditures all that is essential to render 
her schools in a high degree effective. If the furnishing of the desks of schoolhouses 
with suitable text-books will largely increase the efficiency of the schools, while it 
diminishes their cost to parents far more than is its expense to the public, it becomes 
a public good, and may, with great propriety, be done. The text-books may as prop- 
erly be supplied to the school as the fuel or the desks even. ‘ 
‘4A thread which should not be severed.—Superintendent R. W. Stevenson, of Columbus, 
Ohio: The principle underlying free text-books is wrong and must result in evil. «The 
government is the best which gives the people the power and opportunity to do the 
most for themselves. There can be no céoperation without co-interest; to be inter- 
ested in anything the person must havea share that has a value—that it costs something 
to secure—even in education., There are therefore limitations beyond which the State, 
for its own safety, should not go. The State which supplies those wants of its people 
that by common industry and enconomy they can supply for themselves. encourages 
idleness and dependence. | 
The wisdom of the State’s expenditure of money for education depends upon the good 
that will result therefrom. The people are less inclined to pay for teaching-power than 
for text-books. ‘The State should therefore increase its expenditures for teaching- 
talent and qualifications, and put upon the shoulders of the people the burden of text- 
books. * * * But is theoffer of free text-books a proper incentive to secure a larger 
attendance? j 3 
Is not the effort which a poor boy is compelled to put forth to equip himself for school
-P-A-G-E-645
    ; STATE TEXT-BOOK LAWS AND SYSTEMS. 573 
as good training as he will get in the school itself? Working and saving to be able to 
urchase his text-books, accompanied by the feeling of absolute ownership, will be quite 
as valuable in the formation of character as anything the school will do for him. It 
may be said there are other things by which the boy may learn this lesson; yes, but 
none binds him as closely to his school and i impresses him so deeply with the feeling that 
he has a part to perform. It often happens that a parent who has been at the expense 
of purchasing text-books will insist upon his child attending school for this reason alone. 
It will not be‘amiss to inquire into the cost of schoolbooks and supplies to ascertain 
definitely if possible the actual burdens their purchase imposes. The course of study 
in city systems of schools below the high school embraces a period of about eight years. 
In the city with which I am most familiar, text-books and supplies are purchased by 
the pupils of retail dealers. The average annual cost per capita for four years, primary 
grades, is $1.27; for four years, grammar grades, $4.08; or for eight years, primary and 
grammar, an average cost per annum for each pupil of $2.67}. This includes the fol- 
lowing items: Text-books—6 different readers, 2 grammars, 2 arithmetics, 3 geogra- 
phies, 3 music‘readers, 1 United States history, 1 science primer, 10 copy books, 12 draw- 
ing-books, 6 blank composition-books. Supplies—2 slates and pencils, lead pencils 
and pens, "penholders, sponges, erasers, drawing instruments, metric ruler, and drawing 
and copy book covers. The whole expense to the pupil for the eight years’ course is 
$21.40. Should text-books and supplies be purchased by boards of education at whole- 
sale and not retail dealers, the cost per pupil for eight years’ course would be $16.05, or 
$5.35 less, which would be an average cost per year for each pupil of $2. Should boards 
of education purchase the supplies, and require the pupils to purchase their text-books, 
the cost per pupil for eight years would be $12.77. At the highest prices the burden is 
not heavy for even a day laborer. The expense for the entire school course for eight 
years is but.a little more than the amount necessary to keep a healthy boy in shoes one 
year. It is barely large enough toremind the parent that he has some share in the educa- 
tionof hischild. In many casesit isthe only thread that holds the parents and the schools 
together. This should not be severed. It is quite natural for people’ to interest them- 
selves in nothing unless init they have a money interest. The only advantage thati can 
see that would come out of a system of free text-books is that it would stop for a time 
the mouths of grumblers. The same people will demand more. ‘Take the children 
of some people, clothe, feed, shelter, and educate them, and they will still grumble. 
Every step taken, by legislation or otherwise, to lighten the responsibility of the people 
in the education of their children weakens the system and lessens interest in the schools. 
On the contrary, every dollar spent by the State for greater teaching ability and better 
scholarship will strengthen the system of public education. 
Objections to free tevt-books.—State Superintendent E. HE.’ Higbee, of Pennsylvania: 
Some, assured that a uniformity of text-books can never render teaching less vague and 
more consistent, as it has no power to render uniform either teachers or communities, 
put on the contrary serves only to make school work more mechanical and routinish 
and less individual and free, yet willing to take into account the element of expense, 
have thought it best that the children of the schools should be supplied with books by. 
the directors free of all cost, which would obviate all expense growing out of change of 
residence from school to school, and at the same time keep the school work free from 
the dangers and temptations ofa uniformity determined by authority external to the 
directors and teachers themselves. Even this course, which has the full sanction of 
Massachusetts, and is allowed in Pennsylvania, has many serious objections. It weak- 
ens with parents, it is felt, that sense of responsibility for the culture of their children 
so necessary to an intelligent family life; it carries away from the household library 
the endeared treasures of well-conned childhood books; it dulls the feeling of ownership 
upon the part of the children themselves, which is felt ethically to have great educa- 
tional value; it gives countenance to a neglect of the higher intellectual enterprise of 
the people, who, by being challenged to give only bread-and-butter support to their’ 
children, become indifferent to anything beyond; andit dullssympathy with that whole- 
some American habit of business, which rightly allows to individuals and families and 
subordinate municipalities the utmost swing for free impulse and activity. 
Attended with excellent results,—Dover (N. H.) school board: The introduction of free 
text-books into our schools, as recommended in our report of one year ago, has been at- 
tended with excellent results. The difficulties which many feared would attend the 
free supply of books have not been realized; they are well cared for by the pupils gen- 
erally, and the teachers express the opinion that the bocks are preserved in better con- 
dition than they would be were they owned by the children. 
Has well repaid all extra work and expense.—Report of one year’s experience of free text- 
books in Acworth, N. H.: The superintendent has taken entire charge of the text-books, 
requiring each teacher to keep a complete list of all the books furnished and the names 
of the pupils using them, and to see that none were lost or destroyed. While the care

of the text-books has greatly increased the duties of your superintendent, it has well re- 
paid all extra work and expense in the greater ease with which a perfect uniformity of 
ooks has been maintained, and the fact that every pupil has had all the books needed, 
while under the former custom ope book would frequently be expected to meet the re- 
quirements of two or three pupils'in the same family, ‘The entire expense for the books 
the past year has beén only $131.50. A j f 
Has silenced opposition.—Superintendent E, N. Jones, of Saratoga Springs, N.-Y.: The 
operation of the free text-book system, which went into effect at the beginning of the year 
covered by this report, appears to have silenced whatever opposition to it there may 
have existed at the time of its adoption. There is every indication that the advantages 
claimed for it by its advocates are being realized. There is no doubt that the marked 
increase in attendance during the past year is one of its beneficent results. ; 
Effect of text-books on the eyesight.—Superintendent Henry Sabin, of Iowa: In the prepa- 
ration of text-books great care should be taken to relieve from undue exertion the eyesof 
those using them, Itissaid by those who have investigated thesuhject that detective eye- 
sight is on the increase among our youth. It is unquestionably true that poor paper, 
bad impressions, broken and worn-out type, and fine print in our books have had much 
to do with injuring the sight of school children. The paper used in our schoolbooks 
should be thick and firm in its texture, so as not to be transparent; it should be white, 
forming a sharp contrast with the black letters, and without any gloss to dazzle the 
eyes. The ink isa matterof importance. The type should be of a proper size and form 
so as to give a perfect impression, and the general arrangement of the page should be 
such as to render each letter and word legible without any conscious effort of the eye, 
The eyesight of the child is his most precious heritage; more precious even to the chil- 
dren of the poor than to those of the wealthy, as its use is one of the means by which 
they are to obtain a livelihood. A text-book which is not made in accordance with the 
latest scientific discoveries, calculated to preserve and strengthen this sense, should not 
be allowed inthe school room. Such mechanical perfection is not the result of accident. 89. . 
- To produce it requires expenditure of money, scientific research, and the employment 
of skilled labor. i 
The limit to uniformity.—Superintendent R. W. Stevenson, of Columbus, Ohio: A 
uniformity of text-books within certain limitation is desirable. It is perhaps well for 
a system of schouls under one board of education and one superintendent to have uni- 
formity of text-books, but the instruction will be broader and better in many subjects 
without uniformity, For example, a class in history of the United States, or general 
history, or in geography, will do better work if every member of the class has a book 
by a different author. From an educational standpoint, State uniformity is clearly 
against progress. I do not know that this scheme has a friend among prominent edu- 
catioual men anywhere, east or west; and yet it would be one of the results of the State 
going into the publishing business. The difference of conditions between the country 
schools and the city schools would not be considered. No opportunities would be 
offered for the profession to improve its own method of instruction, The selection of 
text-books for the State would be necessarily put into the hands of a commission ap- 
pointed by the legislature or the governor. The people would have no recourse, no ap- 
peal from its decision or contracts. The publishers of the books adopted would have a 
general monopoly, and if the prices were low it would be easy to make the quality of 
paper and binding to correspond. The adoption would have to be fora long period, and 
the saving in expense to the people on this account would be lost in the improvement 
of methods as suggested by ithe most recent text-books. No one would dare say that a 
commission made up of even scholarly men, and men of experience as educators, would 
equal in their combined wisdom and knowledge the local boards of education which 
come direct from the people. The scheme is contrary to the genius of our republican 
form of government. The uniformity of text-buoks if desirable at all should be to the 
unit of the school system of any State. If the unit is the township, uniformity in the 
‘text-books should be limited to the township; if the county, then the county should 
be the limit. 
A visionary and impracticable scheme.—Superintendent R.W. Stevenson, of Columbus, 
Ohio: But is it possible for a State to produce a text-book for schools, without competi- 
tion, of equally as good quality and as cheap as individual publishers with competition, 
subject to the tests of scholars and educators rather than politicians? Is it possible fora 
hired commission t produce text-hooks as acceptable to the progressive teacher as books 
  would be that come from authors whose knowledge and experience have given them 
clear notions of what text-books should be? Is it advantageous to a State to shut out 
all text-books not only not purchased within its domain, but to limit their production to a 
commission the test of whose qualifications is personal and political favor with the 
powers that be? ‘Lhe teacher who has an ambition and an inspiration to write a text- 
book is generally a good teacher or believes himself to be such, He should have the

opportunity given him to gratify this ambition, which he can not have unless he goes 
to another State more liberal, where machine books would not be tolerated. No scheme 
that has been devised for cheapening the cost of text-books is so impracticable and vis- 
ionary as the one which proposes the preparation andgpublication of text-books by the 
State. ' i , 
State control of tevt-books.—Superintendent A. P. Marble, of Worcester, Mass: These 
attempts at State interference with that which does not belong to the State have not 
been successful. Naturally they have created evils greater than those which they are 
intended to cure. They are contrary to the genius of our institutions; for these insti- 
tutions recognize the people as the source of power, and not some central authority, as 
in Kussia, 
State decree is usurpation; it abridges unnecessarily the natural right of a community 
to secure in its own way the results which the State may properly demand; it almost 
inevitably breeds corruption. State contract, the next step towards Russia, is a further 
usurpation; it perverts the function of the State trom government to business, from 
making laws for the general good to selling schoolbooks, with a purpose, by no means ac- 
complished with any certainty, of saving a tew cents yearly to the individual citizen. 
| These two having failed to secure what they aimed at—and quite naturally they fail, 
because the State is assuming an incompatible function—a third remedy is proposed in 
State publication. 
An American familiar with his country’s history, and with the development of our 
institutions, finds it necessary to reconstruct his idea of what a State is, and to attach 
to it new and unusual functions, betore he can contemplate the idea of a State’s making 
schoolbooks. Such a work is in harmony with the imperialism of Russia, but is utterly 
foreign to American democracy. A paternal government, which undertakes toregulate 
everything about the lives of its subjects, may make the schoolbooks which they use, and 
even prescribe the medicine which they shall take when sick, Our Government was 
founded on the theory that every man can take care of himself, and that he has the right 
to select his own pills when he is sick; and for making schoolbooks the State has not 
the necessary machinery any more than for making poetry. 
Uniformity recommended in Idaho.—Superintendent C. C, Stevenson: A series of text- 
books having been once adopted by the board of county commissioners and county 
superintendent, must remain in use and are not subject to change for four years. No 
two counties in the Territory have the same books in use, and some are using inferior 
works for the reason that the county commissioners were not qualified to make such 
selections. It would be much better if we had the same provision now in operation in 
many of the States—of one universal system for the whole Territory. \ 
Some facts about text-books.-—State Superintendent W. E. Coleman, of Missouri: The 
question of schoolbook legislation has been agitated to considerable extent in recent 
years, and numerous bills introduced into the last three General Assemblies for the 
purpose of settling this vexed problem, There appears to be a general belief that 
something is radically wrong; that schoolbooks cost too much money, and that too 
many changes are made in text-books, thereby entailing unnecessary cost to the patrons 
of the public schools. No doubt this is true; but, granting this to be so, what is the 
remedy? In this matter, as in many others, the tendency is to go trom one extreme to 
another, therefore men have rashed to the conclusion that the only remedy is in-legis- 
lation; that the State should enact a law, appoint a commission to prepare, publish, 
and distribute the text-books and sell them at actual cost. This sounds very well to 
talk about, but how would it work? * * * 
Facts are stubborn things to deal with in a case like this, but a few are here given 
for the benefit of those who are clamoring for legislation upon this subject. 
1. Why are these changes made in text-books ? 
Answer. For the following reasons: School boards have been too careless, negligent, 
or cowardly to comply with the law and execute its provisions, While the law pro- 
vides that the school board, in any given district, shall fix the grade of the school, pre- 
scribe the course of study, and designate the text-books to be used, the board has simply 
turned the whole matter over to the new teacher—for new teachers cause most of this 
trouble—and this new teacher, desiring to teach the books he studied in school (not 
being qualified to teach those already in the school), immediately inaugurates a war on 
the books now in use in said district, and sets to work to have a change made; the board 
simply does nothing, the change is made, throwing out better books than are put in, 
and general confusion is the result. All this could have been remedied by the board 
doing its duty by adopting the books to be used and requiring the teacher to use them, 
allowing no change except when necessary, and then making the change ‘‘by order of 
the board,’’? * * * ' 
2. Why do schoolbooks cost such enormous prices ? 
Answer. ‘The regular prices of schoolbooks, while perhaps too high, are not enormous, 
   
-P-A-G-E-648
   
          
576 | EDUCATION REPORT, “en ; 
if judgment is exercised in purchasing them, as is manifested in buying other articles of 
necessity. The retail dealers sell these books for 20, 30, and 40 per cent. more than the 
advertised retail price as given by the publishers. jee ea ” 
3, Can these evils be remet logby our present law? .— i 
‘Answer. They can, most undo tedly, and all that is required to remove all the fric- 
tion and secure books at reasonable figures, is for the board to execute the law faithfully, 
as follows: 4 | | 
~ Let the board, ‘by order of the board:?? 
(a) Pass upon and adopt the rules and regulations to govern the school. 
b) Outline the course of study to be pursued in the school. i 
(c) Adopt the books to be used and allow no others nsed except for supplementary 
work. { } ‘ 
(d) Change books only when they can be superseded by better ones; and then the 
‘change should be effected through the publishers of the books to be used at the exchange 
or introductory prices. } i A 
(e) When jndividuals desire to purchase they can order direct from the publishers and 
save 20 or 30 per cent., or the secretary or clerk of the board can order books for a whole 
class at the wholesale prices. 
(f) Allow no teacher to adopt or change a text-book. — 
By following the law as Jaid down in the foregoing suggestion unnecessary changes 
will be averted and the cost of schoolbooks, to any district, greatly reduced. * He 
What does State adoption mean? It has been tried. in California, Minnesota, and 
Indiana, therefore the question can be answered with some degree of accuracy: 
1. It will require fiye years for the State to prepare, publish, distribute, and place these 
Hooks in the public schools of the State. | 
2. It will necessitate the lossof all the books now in use, for they must be displaced 
jn order to introduce the State books; this will necessitate an expenditure of one and a 
“half million dollers to be paid out directly by the patronsiof the public schools. 
3, Itis a hazardous business to intrust the preparation of text-books to any four or 
five men the legislature may designate. What guaranty have you that the books will 
be as good as those now in use or that they will be furnished at any less cost than you 
now have to pay? t 
Regulation and control of schoolbooks.—Superintendent J, M. Greenwood, of Kansas City 
schools (writing in February, 1891): Since thesystems of public-school instruction are not 
at all uniform in the various States of the Union, it is evident at the outset that no one 
law will be found best for each one of the States, It is also evident that the law will 
pe best which brings directly to the people at their homes the books which they desire 
at the lowest possible cost, and that some degree of uniformity is necessary in order that 
books may be used in the sehoolroom with the greatest economy of time. Uniformity 
of schoolhooks is and should be dependent upon a uniform course of study, and should, 
therefore, be controlled by the local officers, who have charge of the business affairs of 
the schoolroom, such as employment of teachers, the regulation of school hours, the 
laying down of a course of study, and the providing of standards for examination. In 
some States this control is vested in the district, in others in the township, and in a few 
. Gn the county. In no State in the Union has the entire State been placed under the 
control of one board with respect to all these particulars. ‘The only ground for State 
or county uniformity has been to provide for the people who move from one locality to 
another. This is legislating for the minority at the expense of the majority. The 
- number who move in any given year constitute much less than 1 per cent. of the popu- 
Jation. A law based upon such ground is manifestly indefensible, and no other ground 
has ever been urged that is worthy of consideration. * * * 
'A few States have contracted for series of pooks for the whole State. These are Min- 
nesota, Indiana, West Virginia, Virginia, Louisiana, and perhaps some others. In two 
of’ these States the expense, of distribution is borne by public taxation, and the nominal 
cost of books to the pupils is reduced by such taxation. That is, the pupil pays a cer- 
‘tain proportion of the cost and the taxpayer bears the rest; and when the taxpayer’s 
proportion is added to the prices paid by pupils it a easily demonstrated that the ag- 
gregate cost of text-books is considerably more than the prices paid where no such law 
exists. ‘Chis is the Indiana plan, and in the past year the total expense of text-books 
for that State has been 10 per cent. larger than it ever was in previous years, and only 
two-fifths of books are yet supplied under contract. No scheme of State contract has 
ever prevailed continuously in any given State without giving rise to scandals, abuse, 
and discontent. 5 ety 
Another objection to a State uniformity plan as governed by State contract is found in 
the fact. that since no uniformity exists naturally, any establishment of uniformity in- 
volved the throwing away of the vast accumulation of schooibooks in the hands of the 
people. It has been caleulated and certified by the official people of legislative com-

mittees that the total supply in any given State is more than five times the supply 
purchased annually. In order to give any realsaving, therefore, by the establishment 
of uniformity, it is necessary that this saving shall be more than 50 per cent. of present 
cost. Thisis manifestly impossible. Itis fleets Pl agcrelores in any law, that the people 
shall be enabled to save the books already in use, ¥epresented in each State by a sum 
of money which may roughly estimated by multiplying the pupils enrolled by two, as 
the amount of books in each pupil’s hands is estimated at two dollars. It must be 
remembered that the average annual supply purchased by each pupil has been ascer- 
tained to be less than forty cents (see report to Ohio Legislature, February, 1891). In 
order to produce the least expense, a law must therefore provide for local control, and, 
if necessary, for local contract, by the public authorities in each locality. By local con- 
trol, they can retain the use of the books ‘already adopted, if this seems desirable. By 
contract, they can obtain from any publisherin the United States their supply of books 
at precisely the same rates given to any State contracting for the same; that is, the 
smallest school district can contract on as favorable terms as the largest State in the 
Union. ‘ach community having selected its books and made a contract, if such seems 
desirable, should then have the option either to supply the books by direct handling, 
or by transfer of the contract to a local bookseller under limitations as to selling price; 
and it should be made the duty of the local authorities to see that these prices are not 
exceeded. If itis thought best by local authorities to furnish the books by public 
taxation and to loan them to pupils, this authority should be given only by vote of the 
people in the locality. The American people should always be free to determine their 
own taxation. This method of supply by public taxation has been miscalled the ‘‘free 
book system,’’ and great claims have been made for this method as being cheaper than 
any other. This claim has been sustained only by an absolute misrepresentation of the 
average expense of purchase in the open market. It has proven that under the direct 
purchase plan the expense has been less than forty cents per pupil; whereas in the case 
of Springfield, Mass., a year ago it reached eighty cents per pupil by the “‘free book 
plan,’’ being twice the average cost per year under the usual conditions of demand and 
supply. A recent article in the Nebraska State Journal, February 11, 1891, pertinently 
states: * 
“The objections to furnishing schoolbooks free are, first, that it will result in extrav- 
agance and wastefulness, as it is not human nature to take good care of property that 
costs the user nothing; second, that, it discourages independence and individuality.’ 1t 
is a step in the wrong direction. “The best results to humanity are secured by laws that 
presume that every citizen is normally capable of supporting himself and providing for 
bis family, and that interposes public charity only when the individual fails through 
illness, misfortune, or congenital worthlessness to measure up to the common standard 
of efficiency. The aggregate cost of education is reduced by our public free-school sys- 
tem, and at the same time the opportunity is made very nearly universal, But there 
is no more economy in the proposition for the State to furnish text-books for the schol- 
ars than there would be in the State furnishing them the clothes in which to appear. 
The blessing that costs nothing is not the one most highly appreciated.’’ 
The ideal law with respect to school supplies is the one that brings the purchaser and 
producer nearest to one another, and prohibits unnecessary changes oftener than once 
in five years. The least possible intervention of official meddling, public taxation, or 
official handling will be found cheapest. The more open the competition, the better 
will be the results. 
The American people are capable of self-government, and this principle of self- 
government is as efficient in local government as in larger organizations. The people in each district, in each township, and in each county are as capable of deciding what 
they want as are their representatives when assembled in State or in Congress, Under existing conditions, as before stated, the smallest school district can purchase as cheaply 
as the larger one, and there seems to be no good reason whatever for the enactment of any law looking to the purchase under contract for State or county supplies on the plea of a saving in expense. Atno time and under no circumstances will it be possible to 
establish a monopoly in the supply of schoolbooks, except by direct act of legislation, 
contracting for one series for a State and excluding all others. If all the publishers in the United States were to be joined to-day, new ones would rise up to-morrow to fight 
the combination, American people will not submit to any continuous domination from monopolies, and the schoolbook publishers are fully aware of this fact. Open compe- tition, a free appeal to the people in each community, a fair examination of qualities, and a candid comparison of prices are what every honest schoolbook publisher desires. Wherever the matter of contract or adoption has been removed far from the people in- terested it has been found that price alone becomes the ruling element, and quality or adaptation to use is ignored. Schoolbooks, good, bad, or indifferent, cheap or dear, can be obtained by any locality desiring them at fair prices without the necessity of a mo-

3. It should provide for the|continuance of the adopted books for at least five years. 
Under such conditions competition would be active, constant, and the people would 
have the decision of such matters as should be left to their control. 
How far uniformity is desirable.—Hon. L. 8. Cornell, State superintendent of Colorado: 
Uniformity of text-books did not always have the meaning that these words now convey. 
' Some of us can remember ong each child came to school supplied with such books as 
had come down to him through the careful hands of two or three generations, or had 
been given him by some kind-hearted neighbor. If perchance he owned a book pur- . 
chased for him, it might be any one of several yarieties on sale in the village store. A 
country teacher with filty or fists pupils of all ages thus equipped could have but one 
opinion on the desirability of uniform text-books. i ( 
That chaotic condition of things, so wasteful of the teacher’s energy and so opposed 
to orderly, systematic work, : past. Children of the same grade in a school use only 
one kind of book on each subject. Not only is this true, but, pleased with the results 
of their work and apparently acting on the principle that ‘ one can not have too much of 
agood thing,’ the reformers have secured the adoption of uniform series of hooks in town- 
ships, counties, and States. Whether this is another case of pendulum-like swinging 
from one extreme tothe other is, perhaps, still an open question. Township uniformity 
is, no doubt, desirable when the township is the unit of the system and the schools are 
all under one management. The same may be said of county uniformity when the 
schools are thoroughly organized and the county superintendent is in fact a superin- 
tendent of schools. But beyond that it seems to me that the most of the valid argu- 
ments fail. If there were a book on each subject absolutely superior to all others, and 
if we had infallible officials to select these books, there could be no question ; but with 
both these conditions unfulfilled it seems to me that State uniformity is wrong in 
theory, as itis unsatisfactory, often abominable, in practice,

   CHAPTER XX. 
POWERS OF CITY SCHOOL BOARDS WITH REGARD TO 
SCHOOL SITES AND BUILDINGS. 
The following pages contain a brief statement of the powers granted by State laws to 
city school boards regarding the selection and purchase of school sites and the erection 
of school buildings; and in cases where such boards are invested with authority in the 
matter of sites and buildings, there is added a brief synopsis of the law showing the ex- 
tent of control they have over the school finances, i. e., the means they possess of making 
their powers effective. : 
The school systems of the more important cities in many of the States, of nearly all 
the cities of some States, are organized under special laws or provisions of their charters. 
A number of such cities are noted in the following summary, though it has not been 
practicable to make the list exhaustive at the present time. 
ALABAMA, 
Township superintendents, at a meeting of parents and guardians and in consultation _ 
with them, fix the location of schools. (Sch. Law, ed, 1889, sec. 967.) An appeal 
lies to the county superintendent. (Sec. 970). 
Schoolhouses are built by local taxes; all local funds are expended as the township 
superintendent or other local authority provided by law may prescribe, (Sec. 1016). 
Mobile County.—The board of school commissioners has ‘‘ power to purchase or lease such 
property for school purposes ‘as in their judgment may be necessary for the proper ac- - 
commodation ’’ of pupils and teachers. The board has power to levy and collect taxes. 
Birmingham.—Board of education has ‘‘ power to build upon the property of the city 
suitable houses for the use and accommodation of the public schools.’? Board levies a 
tax not exceeding 15 cents on $100, which must be collected and disbursed as they 
direct. y 
Montgomery.—Board of school examiners haye.no power over school property; this 
power is vested solely in city council. 
Tuscaloosa.—The ‘‘ board of education shall have power, with the approval of the 
board of mayor and aldermen, to build upon the property of the city suitable houses for 
use and accommodation of the public schools of said school district.’? Mayor and alder- 
men levy local tax. ‘No contract shall be entered into and ‘no disbursement of any 
money or funds under the provisions of this act shall be made except by the consent 
and under the direction and control of the board of mayor and aldermen.’ 
Troy. —Same as Tuscaloosa, 
            
      
          
  ARKANSAS. 
Boards of school directors of incorporated cities and towns organized as single districts 
locate and establish schools. (Sch. Law, ed. 1889, sec. 6266.) They ‘‘have power to 
ate or lease schoolhouse sites, to build, hire, or purchase schoolhouses,’’ ete, (Sec. 
265, 
“But no tax for any purpose can now be levied by the county court without a vote f the electors of the district,” specifying the rate. _(Zb., note, and sec. 6262.) 
City school boards, however, may apply any part of thefund belonging to the district 
ot otherwise appropriated to ‘‘building and purchasing a schoolhouse, irrespective of he source from which such fund came,’”? (Opinion Att’y-Gen., p. 73.)

A city or town that maintains an adequate system of common schools is deemed one 
district and is withdrawn from the control of the county superintendent; otherwise it is 
subject to the generallaw. (Sch. Law, ed. 1886, Art. VII, sec. 6.) The school trustees 
of such a district may “take land, by purchase or donation, for the purpose of erecting

      Crvic INSTRUCTION. ¢ ‘ 
The teacher oe political morality.—Superintendent W. ©. Hewitt, Union City, Mich.: 
Excepting the comfort which comes tu one from knowing something of the Constitution 
as unrelated knowledge, the study of civil government as commonly pursued affords no 
new field of information and no eompleter rounding of the facu ties than is given by its 
sister subjects, history and geography. | It is true that the grammatical study of the 
clauses of the Constitution, together with those questions which are based upon it, 
develop a kind of sharpness which, while it lasts, justifies the causes of its existence. 
Yet its influence is but temporary, and long before the period of the franchise comes 
time has destroyed all traces of the constitutional gymnastics. A boy might better view 
the Constitution through the dim mists of a curious ignorance rather than, knowing it 
eloser, to be repulsed by the ae ed of its unmeaning details. If the Constitution 
is to be made an inspiration the teacher must possess that generous scholarship which 
will enable him to choose the materials of instruction with judgment; he is not teach- 
ing a completed growth, a dead Jaw, but an instrument in which is contained the wis- 
dom of his race, Many clauses of the Constitution are rich in history, others are made 
sacred by the blood of sacrifice, and through all there isa progressive national conscience. 
Year after year we have the discussions, ad nauseam, of *‘ How to teach history,’’ ‘‘ How 
to teach arithmetic.’”? Andon the hypothesis of a poorly educated body of teachers 
these questions always will be asked, always unanswered. 
If, now, the majority of teachers were men and women of culture, four-fifths of all 
the drivel of cS how?’ would disappear. The question usually is, ‘‘ How shall incom- 
petence teach?’”’ It shoul! be, ‘‘Shall incompetence teach at all?” 
Any improvement in teaching that does not look for a higher scholarship in the 
teacher can be only temporary in its effects. The teacher in civil government, then, 
must kuow something of the Bu: works of Kent, Curtis, and Story; if he would under- 
stand the constitutional growth of his country, he must know something of Von Holst; 
and because the Constitution, studied out of relation with the past, is almost meaning- 
less, he must read some such work as Lieber’s Civil Liberty. Just asin history the 
text-book is only one of the factors of successful instruction, so in civil government 
biography, history, and law must all unite in supplementing the work of the recita- 
tion. But if it be said that itis idle to expect such preparation on the part of the 
teacher, then civil government, otherwise taught, is filling no want in the educational 
system of to-day, and the 3,000 school districts [in Michigan] where it is not taught are 
philosophically correct in keeping it from their courses of study. In most schools we 
find subjects best taught which are fixed in their nature and call upon the teacher for 
but little more knowledge than from the pupil, while subjects that are progressive are 
either not taught at all or only indifferently. We find many a man teaching for the 
rest of his life branches of study on work done in the prehistoric times of his life. But 
civil government is one of the branches of study that can not be taught successfully on 
any such foundation. * * * j 
In any correct system of civie instruction knowledge must form the basis, yet knowl- 
edge alone is not sufficient. The welfare of the State demands kinetic, not potential 
energy. This sentiment is shown in the singing of patriotic songs, the increased publi- 
cation of patriotic literature, and the hoisting of the flag upon the schoolhouses of the 
State. However much men may differ as to the interpretation of that term “‘natriot~ 
ism,” all must agree that it does not consist entirely in feeling, but finds its best ex-

pression in action. A man may thrill with’ the music of the Star Spangled Banner and 
remain a clod forever afterward; a boy may be moved by the swelling periods of liberty 
and union and show himself unworthy of liberty when left in a room without his 
teacher. Many pupils associate patriotism with some form of physical prowess; and 
indeed they have cause, for our patriotic literature is full of saber strokes and sulphur 
smoke. It is here that the teacher can show that patriotism is not for the battlefield 
only, but that it lies in being a useful and high-minded member of the commonwealth, 
The pupil may never shoulder a musket, but by learning a useful trade he may add to 
the credit of his community; he may not adorn the legislative halls, ‘th’ applause of 
listening senates to command,’’ but by a careful and conscientious study of his civil 
rights, he may set the example of duty just as inspiring as the duty of the tented field. 
His influence may be small, but it can go through a life, and it may shame vice and 
exalt virtue. * * * 
Born as man is, with the poison of fallibility in his veins, and surrounded on all sides 
by influences that check the growth of mind, it is not strange men find the fight against 
public wrong hard, and are tempted to give up their independence. But not only is 
eternal vigilance the price of liberty, but intellectual vigilance is the price of manhood. 
And the pupil should he taught, through all his schdol course, to feel that he has not 
well acted, unless it is in the light of the fullest knowledge and for the highest purposes. 
He should be taught that the world is full of solemn questions that are to be settled 
only through the intelligence and integrity of such men as himself. And from his 
school he should receive such knowledge as will cause him to view his public acts with 
as much solicitude as the duties of his private station. It is here that the educated 
teacher finds work, not only in teaching the philosophy of the past and the practical 
duties of the present, but in founding both on the rock of a conscious integrity. 
The school is but one of the influences that lead toward a higher morality, but the 
possibilities of the educated teacher may well cause us all to question anew our fitness 
for the work. If this is done in the spirit of the broadest patriotism there will be no 
need to ask if civil government is of value as a study, but men, seeing its fruits, will 
crown it with a diadem of imperial worth.    
Value of classic American literature.—Horace E. Scudder: I have not cared to divide 
my argument; to show the power of humane literature in enlarging and enriching the 
common-school sytem, and then to demonstrate that American literature is the most 
fit instrument to this end. I have preferred to postulate what is inescapable, that 
American literature of some sort our schools will have, and I call you away from the 
cheap, commonplace, fragmentary American literature of our school text-books, which 
have so long done disservice, to the inspiriting, noble, luminous, and large-hearted Amer- 
ican literature which waits admission at the doors of our schoolhouses. The volume of 
this literature is not very great, and it is lessened for practical purposes by parts which 
are inappropriate for school use; but it would not be difficult to replace the volume of 
reading matter offered in the reading books above the grades of the elementary by an 
equal volume of American classic literature,and the gain would beenormous. If, according 
to the common practice in our schools, the child were reading over and over and over 
again the great literature which he would never forget in place of the little literature 
which he will never remember, how immeasurable would be the difference in the fur- 
uishing of his mind. . 
Nor do I fear that such a course would breed a narrow and parochial Americanism. 
On the contrary, it would destroy a vulgar pride in country, help the young to see hu- 
manity from the heights on which the masters of song have dwelt, and open the mind 
to the more hospitable entertainment of the best literature of every climeandage. Lam 
convinced that there is no surer way to introduce the best English literature into our 
schools than to give the place of honor to American literature. In the order of nature, 
the youth must be a citizen of his own country before he can become naturalized in the 
world. We recognize this in our geography and history; we may wisely recognize it 
also in our reading, 
  Patriotism should be inculeated.—Superintendent Henry Sabin, of Iowa: It is especially 
necessary that patriotism, love of our native land, should be inculeated. The flag should 
he displayed in every schoolroom, and children should be taught what itsignifies. The 
singing of national songs and the recitation of patriotic pieces should be encouraged. 
To assign the public schools a place in the observance of Independence Day or of Me- 
morial Day, has a tendency to keep the deeds and sacrifices of their fathers alive in the 
hearts of the children, The growth and resources of this country, the history of the 
past, and the possibilities of the future, should be so impressed upon the child that he 
may be proud to say: ‘‘I am to be an American citizen.’’ 
Should permeate allthe work of the teacher.—W. E. Sheldon: It may not be necessary to 
make any special change in or addition to the school curriculum to secure thé teaching

should permeate all the work of the teacher.’ The facts and principles of good citizen- 
ship should be so presented as to become the life, the soul of the school. The pupil 
should absorb the love of country as freely as he breathes in the pure air. It should 
surround him in the teaching atmosphere of the schoo. =

Trained teachers needed especially in country schools.—Superintendent Henry Sabin, of 
Iowa: The trained teacher who thoroughly understands her vocation, whois fruitful in 
expedients to interest children and arouse their ambition, is needed in the country school 
more even thansheis inthe city school. In the country district the school depends very 
largely upon the teacher; she is subject to but littlesupervision; sheisnot often brought 
in contact with other teachers, and in her little domain she reigns almost supreme, Out- 
side of and beyond their daily eccata her influence over her pupils ought to make itself 
felt for their good. In hiring a person to take charge of a school in an isolated country 
district the personal character, theskill, the training, and the education of the applicant, 
should be considered as of first importance, and the matter of wages per month should 
be so adjusted as to obtain the services of a teacher fitted for that important position, 
Here, as elsewhere, ‘‘ money ae not be weighed against the welfare of the child.” 
No better place to educate a child in the common branches.—P. A. Latta, Allegan County 
(Mich.) superintendent: We hear much in these days about the poorquality of instruc- 
tion in the rural district capt, In fact, there is a tendency to belittle the important 
work they do. I think that much of this opinion arises froma lack of knowledge of the 
quality of work that these schools actually accomplish. During the last year while 
visiting the rural schools I have observed some excellent school work. 
Almostinvariably, where the conditions are favorable to good school work, I have found 
effective and faithful teaching. Iam convinced from long observation of the work of 
_ both graded and rural schools that the average rural school-teacher is as efficient as the 
average graded school-teacher. 
In the work of the rural school-teacher there is less that is perfunctory, less of routine, 
more flexibility in the classifications and more adaptation of the instruction to the in- 
dividual needs of the pupils. These considerations lead me to believe that there is no 
better place, under proper conditions, with the necessary appliances, to educate a child 
in all the common branches and some of the higher English than a good rural district 
school, when conducted by a skilled teacher, : ; 
Obstacles to the success of country schools. State Superintendent W. E. Coleman, of Mis- 
souri: The a schools constitute the great educational force in any State; if they are 
  well conducted, the results are good all along the line; if they are poorthe pupils suffer 
thereby throughout life, for there is certain work which if not done in early childhood 
is never satisfactorily accomplished, Among these schools can be found some as noble, 
true, and grand men and women as ever assumed the responsibility of teaching children; 
and their labor will tell for good in the communities in which they teach, in the lives, 
of those instructed and in t) 8 Bate at large. What a glorious thing it would be if all 
our schools were of this order, but'such is not the case. 
not all thus?” The answer is not difficult; but how to remedy the existing evils is a 
question of eres moment and though answered will be harder to execute. Hun- 
dreds and thousands of the children of Missouri have been starved, educationally, on ac- 
account of the penuriousness of patronsand school boardsthat they elect. A good school 
begets a good, wholesome influence in the community, favorable to education; this in 
turn, is met by liberality on the part of the patrons, and they freely and cheerfully vote 
for along term of school and fair wages; the result is just what might be expected; true; 
active, energetic men are chosen to control the school interests of the district; well- 
qualified teachers are “there a the school district soon becomes noted for its liberality, 
  thrift, and influence. ‘There are several factors that enter into the successful prosecu- 
‘tion of this work, viz: the public, the county superintendent, the board, the parents, 
and the teacher. Each of these occupies a prominent position, and is an important 
factor that can not be ignored in endeavoring to have a well-regulated school. ‘There 
is. no use laying the blame on the teacher, when the board has employed a young, in- 
experienced boy or girl, at the enormous salary of twenty-five or thirty dollars per 
month for four or five months, and expect the same results as are secured in a district 
in which an experienced teacher is engaged for eight or nine months at a salary of fifty 
or sixty dollars per month. Neither is the fault altogether that of the board, for the 
people have not furnished the money nor voted the time that is necessary to secure the 
results desired; therefore, the board has to take a cheap teacher for a short term, and

COUNTRY SCHOOLS. ° “Oob 
* Course of study for ungraded schools in Germany.—John T. Prince, agent of the Massa- 
chusetts board of education: The ‘elementary schools of Germany are required to give 
instruction in religion, including Bible and church history and the catechism; geometry, 
elementary science, ancient history and gymnastics—all of which are seldom or never 
systematically taught in corresponding schools of this country. The course in arith- 
metic does not embrace so many subjects as with us, and there is less of the geography 
of foreign countries and more of home geography than is given in ourschools. In other 
respects there is-nob much difference in the subjects required to be taught inthe elemen- 
tary schools of the two countries; always remembering that with us the requirements 
concerning subjects of instruction here are not always observed. 
In mixed or what are called one-class schools, in which are pupils of all ages, two plans 
of classification prevail, neither of which resembles our classification of such schools. 
By one plan, the older pupils, or those from ten to fourtéen years of age, constitute a 
single class, and are separated in some studies into two or three sections, These pupils 
attend school four hours each forenoon, except Wednesdays and Saturdays, when they 
attend two hours. The younger pupils constitute another class, divided also into two 
or three groups or sections. These attend afternoons three hours daily, except Wednes- 
days and Saturdays, when they attend two hours in the morning. The recitation 
period, as in the graded school, is about fifty minutes in length; and, when the class is 
separated into sections, each division is givensomewhat differeat work to do, although 
all are supposed to be reciting during the period. By this arrangement there are about 
  
  
  
  
    
  
    
  
  
    
    
  
  
      eighteen recitations a week with the older pupils, and twelve with the younger. Ina

From this programme it appears that the older pupils have 18 recitations a week, of 
which 6 are in language (including reading, writing, and language or grammar), 3 in 
arithmetic and geometry, 4 in religion (Bible history, catechism, etc.), 1 each in geog- 
raphy, history, drawing, singing, and physics. The younger pupils have 14 recitations

a week, of which 6 are in reading and writing, 3 are in umbers, 3 in Bible stories, and 
2in observation lessons and home geography, giving a short time one day to singing. 
Such an order of recitations would hardly be tolerated in the schools of many of our 
rural neighborhoods, where t is thought that a teacher is seriously neglecting his duty 
who fails to hear every pupil recite in every branch of the curriculum at least once a 
day.” ge I 
‘The second plan of classification for country schools is to divide the entire school into 
three sections in most subjects, a class in-each subject reciting about fifty minutes, as in 
all other cabo Is. ey | 
Both of these plans of classification are in strong contrast to the classification of our 
ungraded schools, by which there are frequently more classes heard in a day than there 
are pupils, and but five or ten minutes given to each recitation: Some modification of 
our present custom in the direction of the last-named plan would be an improvement. 
Consolidation of ungraded schools.—George H. Martin, agent of Massachusetts board 
of education: The majority of these [ungraded] schools are not furnishing the children 
with the education which the times demand. Nor can theg do so. There can not bea 
good school without a good teacher, and these schools can not attract and hold good 
teachers. The isolation, the difficulty of finding boarding places, the smallness of the 
schools, affording little stimulus to the ambitious and little scope to the enterprising, 
the dullness and backwardness of many of the pupils, the lack of intelligent and sym- 
pathetic in rest on the part of. parents, the prying and captious spirit which pervades 
many of the districts—these, singly or combined, repel the very class of teachers who 
only could improve the schools. * * * 
More money for higher salaries would buy better services for some of these schools; 
but many of them are now the most expensive luxuries which the State indulges in. 
In some the cost per child is from thirty to fifty dollars a year, and many of the towns 
are now raising as much money as they can afford. Superintendents could make these 
schools better. Some of them they might even make good, but the improvement would 
be at an expenditure of time entirely unnecessary. For the State to give more money 
to the towns, under existing conditions, is to put it into a bag with holes, 
More effec tive, than any of these measures, because striking at the root of the evils, 
would be consolidation of schools. Even in the larger towns, with their only partially- 
graded rain there is a waste of energy by scattering it. The attempt in such towns    
  
  
to maintain several schools of the same grade at no great distance from each other 
means low salaries for all the teachers and frequent changes. In one of these towns, 
in each of four grammar schools having male teachers, there have been five principals 
in the last q ears. There are but nine male teachers in the county who were teach- 
ing in their present schools on my previous visit. Consolidation of schools would allow 
closer grading, would secure a much more effective division of labor, and would make 
it possible toemploy a man competent enough, and to retain him long enough to be- 
come identified with the community and to exert an enduring influence through the 
continuity of his services. * * * . 
The consolidation of schools means building commodious schoolhouses, centrally lo- 
cated, and carrying to them the children from the more remote parts of the town, Many 
of these children are now walking one or two miles to school, and they are away from 
home during the whole day. If carried to a central school they would be away from 
home no longer, and would be much less exposed in going and returning. Many chil- 
dren would have little further to walk to a central school than they now have to the 
district school which they are forced to attend. 
Wherever the experiment has been judiciously tried of uniting the small schools it 
has been attended with gratifying success. The town of Concord has tried the experi- 
ment on a more generous scale, having gradually consolidated all its schools in two 
buildings, one in the central part of the town and one in West Concord. The plan.was 
so wise and so wisely executed and the results have been so gratifying as to make the 
town a second time historic. 
No new Iegsaton is needed to make the plan practicable everywhere. The high 
estimate of education and the earnest purpose to furnish the best, which have helped to 
-make our schools as good as they have been, must be looked to to adapt them to exist- ing conditions. Enlightened public spirit may be depended on to devise ways and means to put every boy and girl of school age into a good school, under a good teacher. 
j III.—Epvucation. 
a Character is the thing sought.—Journal of Education: For a child to read and write flu- 
ently, spell and cipher correctly, know all the bays, capes, and rivers of the world, will 
not insure his prosperity, happiness, or peace of mind. The school is responsible for in- tellectual discipline * * * not for the sake of such discipline, but for its effect in
-P-A-G-E-665
a ee a re Pe he ee ed En em ee 
EDUCATION, 593 
domestic, social, industrial, and professional life. Nor are these the real ends in view 
in education. They are but incidental to higherends. Character is the thing sought— 
character in its broadest, highest phases, character upon which a man can bank in time 
: ‘and eternity. The school must do all its work in such a way as to develop incidentally, 
but effectually, all the essential negative and positive virtues, It must be easier for 
a boy from: the schools to be sober, industrious, honest, upright, virtuous, than it 
would have been otherwise. The tendency in his life must be away from personal 
abuse, social demoralization, physical neglect, idleness, and political vagabondism. It 
must help him to endure hardship, acquire patience, cultivate hope, attain peace of 
mind and buoyancy of spirit. We do not teach discipline for its own sake, but for the 
results of discipline in everyday life, in every sphere of life. 
The prime aim of instruction.—Matthew Arnold: The aim and office of instruction,. 
say many people, is to fit a man to get on in the world. It is not this, and the modern 
spirit more and more discovers it not to be this. This is, at best,.but a secondary aim 
of instruction. Its prime, direct aim is to enable a man to know himself and the 
world. Such knowledge is the only sure basis for action, and such basis it is the true 
aim and office of instruction to supply. 
The very corner stone of an education.—John Stuart Mill: The very corner stone of an 
education intended to form great minds must he the recognition of the principle that 
the object is to call forth the greatest quantity of intellectual power, and to inspire the 
intensest love of truth; and this withouta particle of regard to the results to which the 
exercise of that power may lead, even though it should conduct the pupil to results 
diametrically opposite to those of his teachers. 
Infinitely above all. other influences.—James S. Barrell: But infinitely above all other 
- influences combined for the moral training of children in school is the personality of the 
teacher. Consciously.or unconsciously he must influence them for good or for evil. 
Thatinfluience is probably always greater than we suppose. Who of us can not to-day 
recall some teacher of our childhood whose memory is fragrant with all that is beauti- 
ful, good, and true? 
The motives which shoud be appealed to.——Dr. Larkin Dunton: We must begin with the 
child as we find him, a pretty selfish little lamp of humanity. We must bear in mind, 
too, that to be of use to others he must become a man of wisdom and power; hence, he 
must at once be made active. Hence, an appeal must be made at first to such motives 
as will move him to the doing of what he ought to do. His curiosity is to be aroused, 
his love of the wonderful and the strange is to be excited, his desire to be and do like 
others is to be stirred, and if need be his fears are to be appealed to. In a word, he is 
to be made to practice the virtues of civilized life from the start. Among the most im- 
portant of these virtues which the school should strive to inculcate are regularity, punc- 
tuality, silence, industry, benevolence, and obedience. Let the pupil’s moral training 
begin with the practice of these and similar virtues, Secure this by the use of the high- 
est available motives, but secure the practice of these virtues, © 
If they are constantly observed the very observance will create a tendency of the 
raind to continue the practice. If, now, this tendency is reinforced by the presence of 
higher motives the necessity of the lower motives will be correspondingly diminished. 
Hence the need of awakening the higher motives. This can only be done by imparting 
such knowledge of the effects of conduct as alone has the power of quickening the con- 
science. And here we may learn much from the young mother. Would she make her 
child feel the power of moral obligation to refrain from a’course of conduct, she shows 
him the bad effects of the same. This is the universal law. A knowledge of right or 
wrong in conduct is gained through the perception of the effects of conduct. 
The true method of giving moral training ,then, as I see it, is tosecure the right con- 
duct of the child through the use of such motives as he can be made to feel; then to re- 
place lower motives with higher as fast as the habit of doing the rightand the develop- 
ment of higher motives will allow, until, finally, the supreme, the all-controlling motive 
of the pupil is the power of the sense of duty arising from an enlightened intellect. 
Obedience, immediate and absolute ?—Superintendent George Howland, of Chicago: Ina 
well-ordered school the discipline should make a small demand on the teacher’s time or 
strength; should not be, as the same writer states, ‘‘the most painful part of the teacher’s 
work,” but kindly, loving, winning. What more pleasing than to observe with watch- 
ful care the daily development of the mind, the will, the character? ‘‘ Obedience, im- 
mediate and absolute?’’ For the soldier on the battle’s edge, yes; but for the child 
with his instincts of selfhood, his budding reason, his untrained will, and his intuitions 
of freedom, the thing is unreasonable, absurd, and impossible. Which of us can at all 
times control his will or command his attention to a dull discourse, a stupid book, or 
an uninteresting recital?

Prompt and cheerful compliance I admit, put ‘immediate and absolute the words 
savor of the drillmaster, the martinet, the tyrant, the despot, rather than of the teacher 
and guide of youth, and are destructive of all true education and worthy development. 
“The sum of the virtues which schools should implant.—C. B, Gi bert, of St. Paul: It has 
been held from time jmmemorial that obedience, implicit and unquestioning, is the 
first and most important virtue to be implanted in the minds of the young as the foun- 
dation of all other virtues. This is largely held, and is made the basis of our systems 
of discipline, so called, whereas I hope to show that it is really their bane. Obedience 
js not only not the highest of virtues; it is nota virtue at all. A virtue is essential, 
and is always a virtue. Obedience may be, and often is, a vice. Itis the foe to prog- 
ress, the secret of persecution, the pulwark of priestcraft and imperialism. It is safe to 
say that out of unwise obedience to human authority and its unwise enforcement have 
grown more evils than the disobedience of all the rebels of history has begun to cause. - 
‘The former is the father of lies and hypocrisy; the Jatter of intolerance, oppression, per- 
secution. 1 do not deny the usefulness nor even the necessity of obedience. Society 
must exact it, schools must have it, not because it ig virtuous, but because it is expedi- 
ent. Butit must pe dethroned from its lofty place in our schools, as it has already been 
in our American social and political system. Indeed, in schools it will usually take 
care of itself. Nothing needs be said about it, and very little thought about it. As 
cwith the Jaws of nature, children will soon find outall that is of importance in it. When 
necessary it should be enforced, but it should be seldom necessary. Teachers need not 
tremble at the thought as though about to lose their authority. Such a treatment of 
the matter will not cause anarchy, but order; will not render students disobedient, but 
more than oy obedient. Weneed not be afraid of truth; it never yet destroyed.a good. 
Young people in school are very hard to hoodwink. Moral distinctions that puzzle theo- 
Jogians are often quite clear to them, not because of their superior wisdom, of course, 
put because of their freedom from sophistry and the power of tradition. Ordinarily, 
tht boy or girl in school, as much as his elder in society, has @ perfect right to know the 
reason for commands to ‘which he must submit; and the wise teacher, while not brook- 
ing insolence, will yet recognize the right and will not provoke to wrath for the sake 
of proving authority. More than that, the proper development of the child’s character 
requires that he should know some reason for his conduct as soon as he is able to com- 
prehend, and should base his actions upon this as a motive rather than upon the will of 
another. : 
This is not Russia, but free America; and if our schools are to make citizens capable 
of perpetuating free ‘nstitutions they must inculcate something higher than a spirit of 
obedience, something broader than all mere expedients. 
‘The first, then, for us to seek to in the child is seli-control for wise ends, subordination 
of his passions and his actions, not to the will of another, but to his own, and this for 
good ee understood. Tt involves two elements, ‘wisdom and power, the former 
to be gained somewhat by precept, but more by experience in a proper environment, 
the latter to be acquired wholly by exercise. For the wise man whose motives are 
noble and whose self is under the control of his will, law is unnecessary. Law, in the 
sense of restraint, is for would-be criminals. We need citizens who need no law. Law 
js also necessary for the ignorant, including children, as @ guide and a teacher during 
development. 
. Po this end laws should be as simple as possible and of such a nature that they will 
never be felt or consciously obeyed after the moral sense is sufficiently developed to be 
in itself a guide to right action, It js a wise provision of nature that a law not evi- 
dently for the good of those subject to it irritates the mind, ‘This sould be taken into 
consideration in the management of the young. : 
There is still a higher virtue than self-control essential to the perfect man and perfect 
citizen—sel f-sacrifice. This is simply an outgrowth of the former, and is merely a con- 
trol of self for the good of the community. This sacrifice of the one to the good of the 
many is, and must be toa limited degree, enforced by the State; ‘but thus epforced it 
ig not a virtue and offers no pright outlook except as it indicates a majority of self- 
mcliens citizens sufficiently large to control the self-seeking minority. Control of 
self for the general good, particularly and practically known as public spirit, is the 
highest virtue of the citizen, and is developed “not under Jaw but under grace.’? 
These two principles, which are really one, constitute the sum of the virtues which 
schools should implant and cultivate in the youth. Do our public schools make such 
men? y answer would be, only partially. While perfect success may not be looked 
for, tne feel confident that a much higher degree could be reached under a more en- 
lightened system, & system more nearly jn consonance with the social and political sys- 
tems in vogue in this country.

         EDUCATION. ‘ 59S 
The ethical must not be neglected.—Dr. W. T. Harris: Of the five classes into which the 
world of knowledge may be divided, three tower above all others: man as a body, man 
asa soul, and nature or the world of things. In the study of nature students should 
know two great lines, organic and inorganic. The study of man should be made with 
respect to psychological relations, and with the purpose of developing his intellectual, 
ethical, and wsthetica] sides. No matter what may be said to the contrary, the ethical 
must not be neglected. “The theory that a knowledge of the means of self-preservation 
is the most important is fallacious. It is not so necessary that a man should live as 
that he should live in accordance with ethical law. Even the civil law considers this 
the correct view. In other words, that which deals with man as a soul is more impor- 
tant than that which looks upon him as dn organic being. 
The equable development of the whole humdn being.—Jerome Allen: No man will dare to 
say that the equable development of the whole human being is not the grandest work in 
which any person can engage, and no one will dare to deny that in the development of 
this man—soul, body, and mind—there must come in forces to make quick and accurate 
the action of all the senses, and bring to its highest development the hearing, the see- 
ing, the smelling, the taste, and the feeling, so that the man may receive and give im- 
pressions both accurately and rapidly, and that the thinking machine within us‘may 
work up the objects of sense-perception into highest objects of thought-production. 
An examination of the ‘‘ harmonious development’? definition of education; what education 
is,—Dr. W. T. Harris: It has been fashionable in educational treatises since the days of 
Pestalozzi to define the province of education as ‘‘the full and harmonious development 
of all our faculties.’? This is, however, a survival of Rousseauism, and like all survivals 
from that source is very dangerous. It is of first importance to consider this definition 
in the light of psychology. 
At first glance we see that it makes no discrimination among the faculties themselves; 
all have a right, each has a right to cultivation, and the only limitation of this cultiva- 
tion is found in the word ‘‘harmony,’? What the harmony shouldjbe is not said. It 
is implied, however, that the harmony once, reached, there would be a perfect human 
being. Harmony implies a sort of balance, and that there is no faculty of the soul which. 
may be developed supremely, no faculty like that of divine charity, for example, which 
should be supreme. | * 
Again, this definition ignores the great distinction'between our higher and lower fac- 
ulties, between our faculties that are means to ends above them and those faculties 
which are ends in themselves. Sound psychology, for example, looks upon ethical in- 
sight as higher than insight into what is useful asa means toan end. The adaptation 
of means to ends—the use of physical strength, industry, eating and drinking, any sort 
of bodily training, is subordinate to the question of the end for whiclit is used—moral 
purposes being esteemed higher. Moral faculty is supreme as regards all such things, 
and is not a codrdinate factor. 
4ésthetic faculty, taste for the beautiful, is not regarded as codrdinate with moral fac- 
ulty by any people since the Greeks or before the Greeks, Gracefulness was the su- 
preme end of life and esteemed to be even higher than morality in Hellenic art. It was 
in the Greek thought that this notion of harmony arose as a symbol of perfection. For 
in Greek art alone the physical and psychical arein perfect balance; not so in Christian 
art, and far otherwise in the Christian religion; for Christianity teaches that food, 
drink, raiment, or creature comforts of all sorts, yea, life itself is infinitely beneath 
consideration when weighed against the spiritual service of humanity. Bodily health - 
and vigor, sound digestion, good sleep, keen sense-perception, are all good if rightly 
used or subordinated to higher faculties; but to speak of them as forming a harmony 
with the higher is placing the soul and body on the same plane, and this is a fundamental 
error in educational psychology. 
In the third place, the definition ignores the distinction between man as an individual 
and man asa social whole, the State, the civil community, the church, the family. It 
fancies man the individual to be something complete in himself and without relation 
to society—just as we can speak of a clock or any piece of mechanism as complete when 
all its parts are present and properly adjusted. Man has two selves; one his natural 
self as a puny individual, and another his higher self embodied in institutions. This is 
the worst defect in the definition, because it leads the thought of the educator away 
from the essential idea of education, which is this: Education is the preparation of the 
individual for reciprocal union with society; the preparation of the individual so that 
he can help his fellow-men and in return receive and appropriate their help. 
The ‘‘ harmony” definition isabstract; this definition isconcrete. An abstract defini- 
tion is liable to misinterpretation; the concrete one is not. Reciprocal] help of social 
whole and individual in the first place implies both special and general-edueation. To 
help one’s fellows one must get skill in some useful occupation, This may be in any 
tealm of human labor, physical or intellectual, But to be able to receive the help of
-P-A-G-E-668
          
‘ 
  596 , “EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
, 3 
one’s fellow-men implies general education, the capacity to receive and appropriate the 
help of institutions—the spiritual help of the race in science, art, literature, and moral 
and religious ideas, as well as inthe matter of creature comfort. The world market yields 
to the individual man for his day’s labor a share in the productions of the world; neces- 
sary food, clothing, and shelter, luxuries, amusements, churches, libraries, lectures, news- 
papers, and books. The prudent man buys wisdom and developes his lower faculties 
only to the extent that they are means to this higher en of acquiring wisdom and dis- 
pensing it to others. 
‘The supremest folly.—Samuel B. Capen: The highest bodily development is that which 
cares for each and every part in its proper proportion. Ifa single organ is omitted the 
whole body suffers. Going one step higher, we consider it supreme folly tocare for the 
pody and neglect the mind; to train that which is only animal at the expense of the in- 
teliectual. Hut the supremest folly mustever be that which, caring for the body and 
mind both, neglects that which is spiritual and eternal. 
What human lifeand experience are made up of.—Horatio Stebbins: There is, it seems 
to me, some confusion, and in provincial minds some conceit, about what is called ex- 
act owed and the nature of the evidence with which we have to deal in the 
different departments of study is often exaggerated. The area of ‘‘certainty,’’ as it is 
called, is surely much smaller than some people think; and human life and experience 
are not made up of the demonstrable, the exact, and the definite, but of judgments, 
opinions, probabilities, presumptions. ‘We walk by faith and not by sight’? is as 
profound philosophy as it is pure religion. Life is more poetic than mathematics; the 
apprehended plays a larger part than the comprehended; and if we had nothing but 
understanding we should understand very little. Science means right knowledge of 
what is; and it comes in many ways. ‘The mathematics must ever hold a high rankin 
human studies as an instrument of the mind. As a training they are limited to one 
kind and one degree of evidence. They have no partin forming the judgment. Those 
who are ignorant of the real nature of mathematics think them to he the key of all 
reasoning, the perfection of training. Butthey no more teach reasoning in the common. 
every-day sense than siding in the cars over Siskiyou Mountains teaches the miner to 
thread the forest on a mule. 
Not knowledge merely. Horatio Stebbins: We count a man educated in proportion to 
the exactness, breadth, and nobleness of his ideas. What is needed to elevate, refine, 
and give power to man’s nature js not that he shall be an encyclopedia, but that he 
should have great ideas based on knowledge and thought. Studies and thought inspire 
the mind if they are brought jnto relation with a mind that responds to their touch. 
‘A knowledge of the child-mind at work wanted..—W. 8. Jackman: Perhaps the most 
grievous lacix of young teachers is practical knowledge f the child-mind at work. This 
knowledge can be gained only by systematic observation and careful study of the child 
jtself. Memory serves the teacher but poorly in recalling the effects, adverse or other- 
wise, that lessons and objects made upon him in childhood. His training has hitherto 
peen largely a theoretically professional one. ‘The child’s mind has been described in 
the text-books, and its peculiarities jotted down as so many shoals and reefs upon the 
teacher’s chart. Stuffed with the psychology of old minds ‘and impressed with the dig- 
nity of his profession, the Juckless teacher has too often entered the schoolroom in the 
unfortunate condition of having “‘ put away childish things.”? In the inevitable and dis- 
tressing conflict between his methods wrought out in the study and the child’s mind 
jnstinct with nature, it too frequently occurs that the child and not the methods is 
thought to need revision. Every child in the practice school must be an object lesson 
in ee Nip for the teacher. 
The teaching of psychology as to the aim in edueation.—Nicholas Murray Butler: Our 
endowments are qualitatively, alike, quantitatively different. No perfect human mind 
js without the power to know, to feel, and to will, but no two minds have these powers 
in equal degree. Mathematies takes four elements and proves conclusively that the 
number of their permutations and combinations is limited. Each one of them can be 
determined, Nature’s methods are far different, The four influences of the original 
capacity, hereditary tendency, natural environment, and social environment combine 
to form countless millions of minds, no two alike. We may be born free and equal 
before the law, but we are not born free and equal mentally. Hach has his own talents 
and each his own corresponding duties and responsibilities. Thateach is accountable for 
his abilities and for no more and no less than his abilities the parable of the talents 
we he who a who had five talents was not required to return the product of ten, nor 
    
was he who had two punished because he yeturned Jes3 than he who had five. Each 
was accountable for hisown. And this is the teaching of psychology, and of ethics 
through psychology, as to the aim in education, It is the best, alike for all, and yet to

no two the same. We are not to envy others, not to despair because we can not reach 
their level. Our proportionate ideal is within reach of each of us. 
When we are hearing so much of the power of reason and mind, and when the one 
goal of perfect knowledge and absolute command over nature is being emphasized by 
some philosophers as that which is to be reached by all men alike, it were well to remem- 
ber that there are limits to what the mind can accomplish. It were well to recall the 
fact that in the eighteenth century the extreme claims made for the reason resulted in 
exposing the whole fabric of knowledge to the bitter attack of the most thoroughgoing 
skepticism that the,world has eyerseen, and thatin consequence the most powerful thinker 
of modern times made it his chief aim to demonstrate, not the power, but the weakness 
of human reason; for in this way could he perform the greatest service alike to philos- 
ophy and to science. Amiel, whose mysticism is remarkable for its subtle psychologi- 
cal analysis and its profound philosophic insight, emphasizes the moral and religious 
aspects of this truth in his Journal Intime (p. 83). These are his words: 
‘We must learn to look upon life ag an apprenticeship to a progressive renunciation, a 
perpetual diminution of our pretentions, our hopes, our powers, and our liberty. The 
circle grows narrower and narrower; we begin with being eager to learn everything, to 
see everything, to tame and conquer everything, and in all directions we reach our 
limit, non plus ultra, Fortune, glory, love, power, wealth, happiness, long life, all these 
blessings which have been possessed by other men seem at first promised and accessible to 
us, and then we have to put away one dream after another, to make ourselves small and 
humble, to submit to feel ourselves limited, feeble, dependent, ignorant, and poor, and 
to throwourselyes upon God forall, recognizing our own worthlessness and that we have 
no right to anything. Itisin this nothingness that we recover something of life; the 
divine spark is there at the bottom of it. Resignation comes to us, and, in believing 
love, we reconquer the true greatness.’’ 
What man is wise 2—Huntington Smith: Wisdom does not panei in the ability to heap 
up facts, although our school instructors seem to think it does. Wisdom is concerned 
with something “far higher than facts; it is concerned with the true, the eternal, the un- 
changing relations of things. The man who has grasped a few of the elementary truths 
of existence and governed his life in accordance with them is wise, even if he can not 
read a line of Latin or'solve a problem in algebra or work out a sum in the rule of 
three, 
The real object of school education.—New York Evening Post: The history of education 
in this country for the past fifty years has been a history of crazes—the method craze, 
the object-lesson craze, the illustration craze, the ‘‘memory-gem’’ craze, the civics 
craze—calling upon children of eight to ten for information as to custom-houses, post- 
offices, city councils, governors, and legislators—the story-telling craze, the phonics 
eraze, the word-method craze, the drawing and music craze, besides the craze for letters 
and business forms, picture study, and physics. Now arrives manual training. Happy 
is the community where those in charge of the schools have maintained their clear judg- 
ment above all these fluctuations, shiftings, and tinkerings, and have kept in yiew the 
real object of school education, ‘‘to give a knowledge of self, to promote morality and 
refinement through the teaching of discipline and self-control, and to lead the pupils to 
see that the highest and only permanent content is to be obtained, not in the valleys of 
Sense, but by continual striving toward the high peaks of Reason.’’ 
Why new ideas do not take root.—Felix Ellarka, in the Journal of Pedagogy: What was 
it that killed object lessons? What was it that led the kindergarten movement into 
the quicksands of quackery? What was it that led so many excellent educational ideas 
to so early and ignoble a death, the death of failure in indifference? Take any one of 
those ‘‘crazes’’ so skillfully enumerated by the Post—is not every one of those failures 
directly attributable to one and the same cause, want of teachers prepared to take hold 
of new ideas, prepared to test them in the testing crucible of pedagogical principles, pre- 
pared to use them with discretion? American life is wanting in that repose which is 
absolutely necessary for the sound development of the teacher’s practice in strict accord- 
ance with principles. ‘‘ Was sie gestern gelernt, wollen sie heute schon lehren. Ach. 
was haben die Leute fuer ein kurzes Gedaerm!’’ (What they learned only yesterday 
they intend to teach to-day. Oh, what a short alimentary canal these people have!) 
said Goethe, and he may be credited with knowing what he said. Had he lived in the 
Jast decade of the nineteenth century he would have substituted ‘‘never’’ for ‘only 
yesterday.’’?-.* * * 
Look toward New York. With the stroke of the pen it was decreed to introduce 
manual training into the public schools of a city that has over three thousand teachers. 
Lam morally certain that the recording angel wept a silént tear when he recorded this 
outrage. Did the teachers of New York know anything of manual training? ‘The aver- 
age New York teacher knew no more about it than did my dog Bowser. Had they a

preparation for what they were toundertake? Itwas notsupposed that they had, unless 
God gave it to them in t! eir sleep. Yet the powers that be ‘‘introduced manual train- 
.ing.’? No wonder it is fast becoming a craze. It is the natural sequence of intrusting 
a new departure to persons unfit for the task. Catchwords and afew tricks are sufficient 
for the purpose of deception, and they are used. * * a : 
Understand me right: I am not preaching against them (these “erazes’’), but calling 
a halt to having them handled. by untrained, unskilled, unprepared, and inexperienced, 
hence Cestanble and even unscrupulous persons, callin; themselves teachers and going 
py that name on the pay roll. That isthe cause. The effeet js, has been, and ever will be, 
that new methods such as mentioned above ‘and old principles conceived and born into 
the world ages ago by master minds, ‘are run down and into the ground. ee : 
It won’t do to copy our cousins across the water, the Jermans, in everything they do; 
but notice how deliberately, how carefully, how cautiously they introduce new ideas, 
new devices, new methods, by first training a generation of teachers up to them. Gar- 
field’s metaphor of the Democratic graveyard of dgad and buried issues. has its mate in 
the garden bed of the American school in which every bud is pulled open, and when the 
sun rises and in the fullness of noontide looks down upon it, there is nothing to see but 
withered and shriveled-up flowers. x 
The proper education of to-day.—C: M. Woodward: The proper education of to-day is a 
preparation for the duties and responsibilities of life. Our students must therefore come 
out of school with the elements of high character, with a vigorous, healthy body and 
mind, able to put both hand and brain to work, to enter readily into sympathetic co- 
operation with the institutions of their country and time. Practical accomplishments 
are essential to a good education, though they are not the whole of it. While training 
to the full the faculties of the individual, including his mechanical powers, and fitting 
hhim to act his part as a citizen, a home-builder, and a bread-winner, we must not fail 
to set high value on the finest products of the human mind and to give fair introduction 
to the great fields of art and philosophy. 
The ideal early education can be conducted in the family alone.—William Chauncey Lang- 
don in the Century: For real education is the development of distinct personalities, the 
fitting each one severally for his or her own life’s work. This is nota result to be ef- 
fected by contract or in the aggregate. Inthe family alone, and by oron the immediate 
. responsibility of those parents by whom were imposed upon each child from before its 
pirth the physical, mental, and spiritual conditions on which all true after-education 
must be based, can an ideal early education be conducted. If, then, in practice it pass 
into other hands—into those of the nursery governess, the school-teacher, or the col- 
lege—it is and it can be only because of the inability, at some stage of the advance, of 
those individual parents or of that family for its best further discharge. The actual 
agent, whoeyer he may be—even though it be the State assuming, for reasons of public 
policy, the oaraal discharge of aresponsibility which would otherwise go undischarged— 
can be regarded only as the representative deputy or the substitute for the family. 
Development of genius by education.—Prof. J. R. Buchanan in the Arena: And has this 
godlike element [genius] anything to do with education, and with schoolhouses or 
universities, which in the past have ever barred their doors and even their windows 
against it? Can these doors be unbarred and the old emples of memory and conserva- 
tism be made nurseries of the divine element which is latent in all human souls? It 
would be wrong to doubt, for it seems to us an axiomatic truth that there is no ele- 
ment in map which is not capable of culture and development. As genius is the power 
that relies upon itself and explores the unknown in fearless independence, the first thing 
to be done in its culture is to commence the exercise of self-reliance and acquisition of 
knowledge by the independent power of the pupil. Let him begin as if on the assump- 
tion that he isa born genius and must live the life of original, self-reliant manhood, 
competent to live alone ‘and to lead. It is not proposed to pamper egotism by asserting 
the superiority of the juvenile pupil to his comrades and seniors, but to put him to work 
upon the problems which others have mastered and let him realize the modesty which 
is produced by the presence of apparently insurmountable obstacles and impenetrable 
mysteries, which he must resolutely attack and conquer, because they have long since 
been conquered by human energy, and he, as a human being, must not shrink from doing 
what others have done, learning what others have learned, and contributing his own fair 
share of labor in enlarging the world’s stock of knowledge. He should not be fed with 
knowledge when he can gather knowledge for himself, nor guided along any road which 
he is competent to explore by the use of his own faculties. In his very infancy he must 
» be made an independent observer and encouraged to learn, understand, and describe 
everything going on around him by questioning him so critically that if his observation 
is incomplete or inaccurate he will be stimulated to make it complete and perfect. In- 
terrogation is the chief agency of intellectual education, for its function is to compel

thought, and it was wisely selected by Socrates for that purpose. From infancy to 
manhood it should ever be present'as the driving and compelling power—compelling to 
observe, compelling to investigate, compelling to reason, and compelling to remember. 
Men wanted, not mere scholars; the work of general education must be effected early.— ° 
President Timothy Dwight in the Forum: The evil to be greatly apprehended, by rea- 
son of the tendencies of opinion in the popular mind of late, is, as it seems to me, that, 
we shall bring forward a generation of imperfectly educated specialists in this country. 
I mean by this expression—which I use in the less restricted rather than the more re- 
stricted sense—not specialists who are half trained in their own particular department, 
but specialists who are imperfectly educated as men. No result within the limts of 
admitted progress beyond the time of the fathers, is, injmy judgment, more to be dep- 
recated than this. Indeed it may be doubted whether, in every sense, such a result 
could properly be regarded 'as progress at all. The fathers had at least a wide outlook 
as far as their field of vision reached, They believed in men, not mere workers in the 
gteat human workshop. ‘They belifed in individual men, fall grown and matured in 
their whole manhood, and not in mere scholars or practitioners in some one section of « 
life or knowledge, whose mental culture should be limited to that one section. Men 
are what we heed in this country, not lawyers, or physicians, or ministers, but men— 
men who, whatever may be their profession, are more than their profession; men who, 
whatever may be the extent of their knowledge in their own peculiar science, know 
much that is beyond their science and see the glory of all knowing and of all truth. 
Education, according to the true view of it, is like religion. It seeks the individual 
that it may bestow upon him, in himself, the fullness of its blessing. It strives. to per- 
fect the world in its own sphere by making perfect the individuals who form the world. 
It desires and tries, therefore, regarding this as its first and foremost work, to give com- 
pleteness to each one whom it approaches. 
But this work of developing the individual on all sides must, in the sphere of which 
we are nowspeaking, be largely done in the early season. The necessities laid upon usin 
the subsequent years bring limitations with them,and wemust gain our general education, 
in great measure, at the beginning because of the particular demands of the life after- 
ward. In the consecrated period of the school and college course—consecrated to studies 
which work simply to the end of mental growth and of preparation for intelligent man- 
hood—the forces must be set in motion which will keep the wider thought and wider 
education alive through all the narrowing influences of the future and its special occu- 
pations and duties. These forces are the knowledge of the wide-extended field, acqui- 
sitions large enough to make secure the possession of the knowledge, and an ardor that 
can not be quenched. This period which is consecrated to the more general education, 
does not end, according to the view, of many among us, and, I may say, according to © 
my own view, until an age later than that of which I am now speaking [eighteen years]. 
It does not in the opinion of any wise educator inthe lines of the higher education, as I 
suppose, end before this age. We all may unite, therefore, in the thought that the 
progress which I have indicated should bein the line of an open-minded, large-minded, 
tapid, enthusiastic movement of the intellectual powers until the youth is eighteen, and 
that what he should know then is what, by means of the best teaching and the best op- 
portunities, he can know at that age in all the various departments. * * * Iflam 
asked, therefore, what a hoy who has. the best chances ought to know at eighteen, my 
answer is—of course, bearing in mind the limitations which my thought and the nature 
of the case suggests—he should know everything. This is the richness of the blessing 
which education has to give, and which it may give—the richest of all the blessings 
which our human life knows or can know, except that of the personal union of the soul 
with God. x 
By education we go out beyond ourselves,—Dr. W. T. Harris: As natural beings, as 
animals, we live but do not know our living. Only as educated beings do we live a 
conscious life in the high sense of the word. Only by education do we go out beyond 
ourselves as mere individuals and enter into our heritage of the life of the race, 
The uneducated consciousness of the mere animal does not enable him to take up the 
experience of his fellow animals and appropriate its lessons in the form of moral and 
scientific ideas. Only to a small extent does he avail himself of the lives of others, 
Only the species lives on while the individual metamorphosis of life and death takes 
place. But the animal capable of education can go beyond his individual experience 
and avail himself of the lives of all. For the educated there is vicarious experiencé, 
He may live over in himself the lives of all others as well as his own life, In fact, each 
lives for all and all live for each on the plane of educated being. On this plane the in- 
dividual may be said to ascend into the species, and we can no longer say of him what 
we say of the mere animal—the species lives and the individual dies. For individ- 
ual immortality belongs to the being that can think ideas, because ideas embody

the life experience of the race and make possible this vicarious life ofeach inall. The 
religious mystery of vicarious atonement, is, we may see, adumbrated in the deepest 
fact of our spiritual existence. The mistakes and errors of each and every man as well 
as his achievements and successes all go into the common fund of experience of the race 
and are converted into ideas that govern our lives through education. The human race 
lives and dies for the individual man. All the observation of the tacts of the universe, 
all thinking into the causes of those facts, by this process is rendered available for each 
man, He may reénforce his feeble individual might by the aggregate feeling and see- 
ing and thinking of all men now living and all that have lived. 
IV.—EDUCATION AS RELATED TO CRIME. 
- The making of a successful rogue.—The Churchman: Ib is noteworthy, though it is per- 
fectly natural, that absconding clerks and other defaulters are mostly men who have re- 
ceived such learning as they possess from the publi schools. That the public schools 
do turn out a large number of smart men is indisputable, but their neglect of moral 
teaching and training, which is confessed by their best friends, makes them quite as 
likely to turn out smart rogues as competent citizens. * * * It is greatly to be 
feared that the indirect effect of the methods of teaching in our schools is distinctly and 
unequivocally immoral. In nearly all secular schools the one thing which is always 
kept before the mind of the scholar is the snalapenee eae of getting on. The 
stimulus of emulation is constantly applied. | Year after year children are impressed 
with the erie that the first duty of life isto get ahead of other people. Why should 
one wonder that the practical outcome of many years of such training should prove to 
De disastrous to morality? Teach a child that success in getting on is the supreme ob- 
ject of all his efforts; teach him little or nothing of the conditions of right success; prac- 
tically ignore duty as the guide of every step in life, and then why should you wonder 
jf the result of your fine system of education proved to be the making of a successful (or 
unsuccessful) rogue ? 
Probity without school education.—E. Sartorius, a German resident of Mexico: Every 
one who has lived in Mexico for any length of time and has been in contact with all 
classes ought to bear testintony that the people in general are good, acute, dexterous, 
laborious, ingenious, and disposed to any improvement. When it be considered how 
little has been done or is doing to give them an adequate moral and intellectual educa- 
tion, we cap not ayoid being surprised at the good fund of probity that prevails amongst 
all classes. I have lived for many years among the Indians and mixed race, and never 
have I enjoyed greater security in my person and in my property and interests than 
during the period referred to. What could not be done in Europe is practiced in Mex- 
ico without any fear, and that is, to trust to a poor and barefooted day laborer large 
sums of movey, to be carried by him alone a distance of many leagues, and it never 
occurs that the wretched Indian commits a breach of confidence. Such a vice is, up to 
the present, exception, 
Something more thin intelligence required.—Presidont L. R. Fiske, of Albion (Mich.) 
College: That intelligence is not an adequate bar to crime must he apparent to every 
one. The great criminals are mostly persons of a high grade of intelligence. Technical 
or professional knowledge often supplies the very conditions of crime. It is theskillful 
bank clerk or cashier that absconds. It is the man who has the greatest knowledge of 
the means of successful gambling who takes it up as a profession. The burglar takes 
advantage of knowledge which the ordinary citizen does not posseas to make his way 
into his neighbor’s dwelling or bank or other place of business for pillage. Indeed, is 
it not true that in all ages intelligence has been the avenue and inspiration of crime? 
Men of superior mental powers, due perhaps largely to greater intelligence than others 
possess, have been the leaders in the criminal movements of successive ages. Ambition 
js sure to fill the heart of that man who is conscious of unusual intellectual capabilities, 
and this ambition links itself with selfishness, and the result is that for personal ends 
rights are trampled under foot, and crimes, not only against individuals but against na- 
tions and even humanity itself—crimes whose breadth and blackness words can not por- 
tray—are committed. Is hea murderer who kills a man on the street that he may 
get his purse, and that military chieftain who, inorder to satisfy his ambition, organizes 
ap army, leads it into battle, slays his thousands, breaks up innumerable homes, over- 
throws governments, trampling under his feet the rights of all who come in his way, is 
this man simply a hero, not a murderer, not a traitor to humanity? The Jeaders in 
crime are the men who, by virtue of intelligence and distinguished mental powers, have 
thrown disorder into society and most widely carried havoc and ruin wherever they have 
gone. The eee needs to be intelligent, but something more is required to prevent crime 
and insure general respect for human rights,

Give a man both knowledge and skill.—President Edwin Willits, of Michigan Agricul- 
tural College: The regulation specific [for the prevention of crime] is to cultivate the 
moral sense, to supplement intellectual with moral training in our publicschools. Un- 
deniably this suggestion has great force, but does not cover the whole ground. Those 
who have had much to do with criminal character have noted that but few criminals 
are destitute of moral knowledge. Asa rule they know they have done wrong. Many 
have had careful moral and religious training; they have ‘‘ memorized the Ten Com- 
mandments;’’ they can conduct a theological controversy with skill and acumen. 
Some are really religious to a degree that almost disarms suspicion of hypocrisy. Con- 
ditions have been adverse, so that the moral sense has not been developed, or the stress 
of temptation has been more than they could bear. Our worst class of criminals are 
not heathens. Moral training, therefore, will not, be the sole remedy. . Somehow the 
conditions must be changed. * * * ‘ 
It is a mistaken idea that learning a trade is not education, that the ability to work 
at some useful occupation does not enger into and compose an essential part of a man’s 
intelligence. You remember what RuSkin says: ‘‘A boy can not learn to make a straight 
shaving off a plank or drive a fine curve without faltering, or to lay a brick level in the 
‘mortar without learning a multitude of other matters which lip of man could’ never 
teach him.’’ 
A man that can shoe a horse well knows more than the man holding the bridle. 
Skill is intelligence applied, and applied intelligence counts for more in the world than 
stores of knowledge unapplied. Give a man both knowledge and skill and you havea 
well-rounded intelligence; these, with a moral and religious training, will do much to 
keep him outside the prison walls, outside the criminal class. 
Give the city boy something to do, systematic daily labor, and take him off the side- 
walk, and you may diminish your prisons one-half, Give him something that requires 
skill and knowledge, full intelligence. Busy fingers rarely steal. Sin of all kind is 
the product, generally, of the unoccupied mind and heart and handof man. If St. 
Anthony had washed himself at least once a week, had discarded his hair shirt, and 
turned his cell into a workshop, he would have seen no devils to fight. The best way 
to cool off a passion or control an appetite is to sidetrack it into some laudable in- 
dustry. 
    V.—EvVENING ScHOOLs. 
The remedy for irregularity of attendance.—Hon. Thos. B. Stockwell, State school com- 
missioner of Rhode Island: The actual attendance on evening schools for this last year 
has been only 35.5 per cent. of the enrollment, a little more than half of the percentage 
in the day schools. 
Some of the reasons for this condition of affairs are not difficult to determine. First 
of all is the fact that the whole matter is a purely voluntary one on the part of the pupil. 
Another reason is to be found in the too common lack of proper supervision from the very 
opening of the term. ‘The poor quality of much of the teaching doubtless has a good deal 
todo with the breaking up of manyschools. Other minor causes, varying with localities, 
will suggest themselves to the reader’s mind. 
The remedy is probably to be found along several lines; there is no one cure for all of 
the evils. To begin with, the first registration should be conducted more upon the 
theory of securing suitable pupils rather than large numbers. It should be the general 
practice to discourage the entrance of any who do not give evidence of both a desire and 
the ability to attend regularly throughout the course. 
Then the work should be carefully laid out and adapted to the special needs of the 
pupils to be taught with the object of doing the most possible in the least time. Make 
the programme attractivein the opportunities which itoffers. Lastly, put the best teachers 
that can be obtained into the schools; teachers who’ can make the different subjects to 
be taught clear and intelligible; those who have some personal power and influence 
which they can use to hold the pupil when he begins to lose his first zest for the work. 
The experience of several schools in different parts of the State shows that this personal 
element must enter into the evening school even more largely than into the day school 
if even fairly good results are to be secured. 
I would not.be understood at all as questioning the value of the evening schools as a 
whole, for I believe they are a necessary feature of our system and must be extended 
and enlarged in their scope, in 8ome localities at least. But I do feel that in our present 
manner of conducting them we are making but little progress, and that in consequence 
we are guilty of negligence.

VII.—PHysIcAL TRAINING. 
Mental and physical work antagonistic.—J, W. MacDonald, of Stoneham, Mass.: Gym- 
nastics and calisthenics are better than marching, but in my opinion they are overesti- 
mated, More than this, the way they are used, and the reason given, are utterly un- 
scientific. They are usually introduced into the study hours to relieve the mind from 
continuous study. Now, thisis just what ought not to be done, and is the chief objection 
to long recesses devoted to violent play. It is worse than unscientific—it is injurious. 
. At first, it requires some little time and effort to get the brain working, to overcome 
mental inertia, as it were. But after a while the blood begins to flow to the brain, and 
then study runs easily. But suddenly the teacher taps a bell, books are laid away, and 
there is a lively course of gymnastics to call the blood away, to be weakened by nour- 
ishing muscular activity. This being accomplished, the pupils are again set.at work to 
get it back into the brain again, if they can. Thisisaswrongasitcanbe. Mentaland 
physical work are, in a degree, antagonistic to each other. They are, however, both 
necessary, but they should not be alternated like thin pieces of gold leaf between sheets 
of beaters’ skins, From the beginning to the end of the session there should be as little 
interruption as possible to the flow of blood that nourishes the brain, and a period of 
quiet should intervene between mental work and either physical exercise or eating. 
  German and American pupils compared.—William E. Sheldon: We would emphasize 
the importance of some form of physical education in the schools. The valuable results 
obtained by those nations which have paid especial attention to the cultivation of the 
body is well known. The narrow chests and undeveloped frames of the children in the 
American public schools are in sad contrast to the physical perfection of the children of 
the ancient Greeks. It is also apparent in schools where German and American pupils 
in New York City are found together, the German children being splendidly developed 
by exercises in the Turners’ societies. Half a century ago 85 per cent. of our male popu- 
Jation was engaged in farming or other outdoor work, while now hardly 40 per cent. 
are so engaged. In cities and largeitowns the boys now have no wood to saw or chop, | 
and no fields to play in hardly, while forgirls out-vf-door play is almost obsolete. Brick 
walls and concrete schoolyards discourage running and romping, and there is therefore 
urgent necessity for physical exercise and culture to meet the artificial conditions of 
urban life, . 
The following extracts are from the report of the Physical Training Conference (Boston, 
1889): 
The use of muscles by the will as affording rest and recreation.—Dr. William T. Harris; I 
shall define physical training as the conscious or voluntary training of the muscular 
side of our system, which is the special side under the control of the will. Of course 
‘we understand that the vital processes go on without the will, and that this is an ad- 
vantage—it is better that they should remain involuntary. Of course the voluntary 
system has relations to the involuntary system, and this is one of the first questions 
which have been considered by persons who have thoroughly studied physical training. 
What can we do with our wills? What can we do with our muscles that shall help on 
the vital processes and develop them? ‘That is a deep subject. It should be the first 
which attracts the attention of persons interested in physical education, and it should 
be also the last one. We ask what we can do by the action of our wills in the matter 
of developing the muscles of the chest, of the legs, and of the arms, and inquire what 
are the relations of muscle action to digestion and sleep and such matters. We have 
not yet probed these subjects to the bottom, nor have we ascertained the fundamental 
relations of the voluntary to the involuntary functions in diseased conditions. Weare 
continuously finding some new phases, and [ suppose the medical profession discover 
more new facts in relation to this than persons specially interested in physical training 
alone, Physicians discover cases in which some oversight in regard to will-training 
has restlted in interfering more or less with the involuntary processes, so that the lat- 
ter have been retarded, thus injuring some of their functions. We all acknowledge 
the importance of discovering and settling the limits between these two processes and 
defining all the relations between the involuntary vital processes and the conscious vol-

tainly help digestion.. It is known that horseback riding is beneficial, a favorable 
reaction being caused by the jolting movement of the horse. This is supposed to be 
especially a kind of exercise that helps the healthy action of vital organs. Some have — 
contended that it is the best exercise for consumptive people. 
The German system of gymnastics.—H. Metzner, principal of the school of the New York 
Turnverein: The German system of gymnastics ranks high among all the different sys- 
tems known. It is not an experience of late years, like so many others which have 
been put forward with great promises and pretensions by their inventors, in order to 
meet the want of bodily training in our present school education, which, however, have 
been laid aside again after a short trial on account of their insufficiency. The Ger- 
man system has been diligently built up during almost a century by men of science, 
especially physicians, physiologists, and pedagoguesof high reputation, It is in prac- 
tical use since that time, and is to-day in vogue in many European countries in a more 
or less modified form. In the army, as military gymnastics; in the education of the 
youth, as school gymnastics; in the halls of the German turners, as popular gymnastics, 
It is practiced in classes by hundréds at the same time, as well as by single individu- 
als as honie exercises. 
The German system embracesall the different branches of gymnastics: exercises with 
apparatus, light gymnastics or calisthenics, and also all those exercises known‘as out-door 
sports, as running, leaping, jumping, throwing the stone, and the use of all hand ap- 
paratus, as wands, dumb-bells, and clubs. 
The German system has three marked features which no other system can claim in so 
predominant a manner. 
I. It aims at general physical culture, and not at the culture of one special branch, 
Therefore it declines the development of a certain organ or faculty at the expense 
of others. In regard to this we may call attention to the fact that all who have gone 
througha regular course of exercisesinaccord withthissystem have been thoroughly 
developed, and rank as high in proficiency as any person educated by another system. 
The contests among the turners are thus arranged, that exercises in all the different 
branches must be performed. This is also the case when testing scholars in regard to 
their proficiency. The numbers gained, added together, decide the grade of develop- 
ment. The strife for specialties is even not permitted, and a partial or one-sided devel- 
opment is therefore unknown. Yet this does not prevent individual skill and inclina- 
tion from bringing about a greater result in a certain branch; this result, however, is 
not gained by a loss or lack in any other branch. 
IL. It allows, or rather induces, the exercises in classes. The classes are selected by 
a careful investigation as to strength, ability, age, etc., and for that reason it suits as 
well those who practice merely for physical development as those who aim at a pro- 
ficiency of a higher grade. The exercises in classes are a source of endless pleasure, re- 
freshment of mind, and joyfulness, not only to children, but even to adults. They are 
furthermore an inducement for promotion and the ambitious desire to keep step with 
other scholars. They act asa stimulant for greater exertion. It is an undeniable truth 
that all those who have continually practiced in a German gymnasium, or in a school 
in which the German system of gymnastics had been introduced, acknowledge that the 
hours spent there count among the happiest of their childhood or manhood. he variety 
and great number of exercises of the German system and their scientific arrangement 
allow new and indefinite combinations. The teacher can always select a certain number 
of exercises suitable for his class which are as agreeable as instructive and interesting 
to every one of the classmates. Not only the body, but also the mind is kept in a whole- 
some and refreshing activity which will keep away all weariness and tediousness which 
are so often found in other systems. The class exercises of the German system allow 
also the instruction of a large number at the same time, providing sufficient room is at 
hand. 
III. The instruction begins with the most simple and easy movements and proceeds 
gradually toahigherdegree. All fear of danger or harm to the body is 4 priori excluded, 
The apparatus used in school practice is not at all complicated or expensive., A number 
of climbing poles, ladders, and some light apparatus for the high and long leap are sul- 
ficient. They may even be omitted altogether if the necessary room for such could not 
be provided for. In this case, however, we can not call the training a complete one, as 
the aim of training is not only the achievement of a development of muscles, limbs, and 
organs, but also the achievement of courage and self-reliance. It is a fact that many a 
man or woman could have avoided danger or saved their lives had they been courageous 
or resolute enough to risk a leap or to take hold of a ladder in a moment of need. 
The great variety of useful exercises that may be made with the above-named appa- 
ratus, together with the utilization of the almost endless variety of simple and compli- 
cated free exercises, with or without the common hand apparatus, as wands, dumb-bells, 
clubs, etc., which may be executed in the school room, bring about as satisfactory re-

sults as any other system. : Tn addition to this we may proudly assert that its scientific 
and educational value has a with approval wherever it was allowed a fair trial. And 
we also may assert that no other system has so large a variety of exercises and combi- 
nations as this, And for that reason alone it is more qualified for introduction wherever 
gymnastic exercises are wanted, especially in the schools. i 
‘The German system is not in vogue only in the halls of the turners and in their 
~ schools. It has already gained its ground in some of the colleges and athletic clubs, in 
private and in public schools, where teachers educated in the seminary of the North 
‘American Turnerbund act as instructors, ‘i 
The German system does not claim to have any special exercise of its own, or to be 
the sole proprietor of any, that no other system may also produce; no, But it may prop- 
erly claim that it has correctly and practically arranged the gymnastic material for the 
use of any one who seeks health, strength, or refreshment of mind and body. 
In the German gymnasia and schools the lessons begin regularly with a series of free 
and order exercises. Every scholarhas to participate in them. The rythmical order 
in which they are produced calls forth absolute attention, and allows no backwardness. 
They impress on each a feeling of responsibility toward his associates. The mistakes or 
errors, or an insufficient execution of any one, injures the good impression of the whole, 
and thus tends to greater carefulness and prevents negligence on the part of the scholar. 
Class exercises on apparatus follow the free exercises. A change of apparatus takes 
place, and then the lesson ends with some exercises left to individual inclination, The 
latter, however, are limited to a short time according to the ability of the scholars, or 
may be prohibited altogether to beginners. Thus under the eye and control of the teacher 
ascene of activity and liveliness is exhibited, which the educator will look upon with 
satisfaction and delight. 
In consideration of the above-stated facts, a careful examination and a fair trial of the 
German system of gymnastics, free of all prejudice, may properly be demanded when the 
questionis practically to be decided which of the different systems is best apt to be adopted 
in the programme of our public schools. 
The Swedish system of gymnastics.—Nils Posse, M. G.: The exercises are chosen accord- 
ing to their gymnastic value, which quality depends on how the movement combines the 
‘utmost effect on the body with simplicity and beauty of performance. Only such exer- ' 
 cises are used whose local and general effects are fairly well known and proved to be 
needed by the body. Not only the needs of the individual, but his abilities as well are 
to be taken into consideration; and for that reason the teacher must know how to vary 
the exercises according to the degree of physical culture possessed by the pupil. The 
movement should have its developing effects in a short time; it should be simple, so 
that every pupil can do it fairly well, and it should have beauty of execution, according 
to each one’s ability. j 
In order to supply the needs of the organism and to develop the body harmoniously 
the exercises have to overcome a great many tendencies to faulty growth or bad posture, 
and the greater or less value of a movement depends on its power to counteract or correct 
these tendencies. It naturally follows that the system uses no exercises which would 
encourage such faults (for instance, using chest weights for beginners, etc.). If an exer- 
cise gives rise to faulty posture it is discarded, or at least postponed till some future day 
when it can be correctly executed. 
In accordance with the physiological truth that the first, greatest, and most extensive 
effect of exercise is on the respiratory organs, and that hence during exercise these orgaus 
must be allowed perfect freedom of motion, the Swedish method disapproves of and dis- 
cards all movements which compress the chest (such as Indian-club swinging) or which 
in any way interfere with free respiration, and the greatest attention is given to the 
proper development of the chest. In recognition of the fact that to be truly strong a 
man must know how to breathe well, much prominence has been given to ‘respiratory’? 
exercises. ‘‘Breathe!’? ‘Don’t hold your breath !’’ are common exhortations in gym- 
nasiums where this method is used. 
In judging of the effects of an exercise we think the least of the muscular develop- 
ment produced, for the effect of all general exercise is to develop muscle, and this aim 
is reached without especially working for it. But we think all the more of the effects 
produced on nerves, vessels, etc., for the results in this direction can be vastly changed 
by varying the movements (as demonstrated in Medical Gymnastics); in other words, 
the exercises have been made to harmonize with the laws of physiology. - How this is 
done will be understood from the description of the exercises which are contained in 
each lesson (to which I shall soon refer). 
Measuring a man’s strength, we compare the man to himself; we do not say that a 
man is strong because he can hold so much air, or bécause he can lift so many pounds, 
or because he can jump so high. But when he possesses a healthy, well-balanced, and 
well-proportioned body, which his will has under good control, then he possesses physi-

      PHYSICAL TRAINING. . BOE 
eal culture, even though in the eyes of some he may seetn weak as compared to others. 
It is this health, symmetry, and harmony we aim at in selecting the exercises; and that 
the Swedish method accomplishes its purpose has been too well demonstrated to leave 
room for doubt. i Bee 
Movements are never chosen ‘‘ because they look so pretty,”’ for educational gymnas- 
tics do not aim at beauty of performance. When gymnastics do have such an aim they 
are called ‘‘:sthetical,’? and these have but little effect toward physical development. 
And yet we claim that when a movement is well done it is graceful as well. Some per- 
sons mistake a languid manner of motion for grace, and hence claim that the Swedish 
exercises ‘‘are too jerky to be graceful.’’ It is to be remembered that all gymnastic 
movements are not slow, nor do they have an even velocity; there are some that can 
and always should be done with great and accelerating speed, and you can move quickly 
and yet do it gracefully. By making the component motions of movements like the arm 
extensions merge into each other in a ‘‘graceful’’ manner, the effect of the movements 
is completely lost. On the other hand, if exercises like leg elevations, backward flex- 
ions of the trunk, ete., are done in a ‘‘jerky’’ manner, these movements are incorrectly 
executed and have lost their best effects. 
Our second point for consideration is the regularity of method. a 
in order that gymmastics be systematic there must be progression. In the Swedish 
method this is adhered to very strictly, so that the exercises, beginning by the very 
simplest, gradually become stronger and more complicated. So closely has the effect of 
movements on the human organism been studied, that the slightest change of position— 
eyen the turning of a hand—has its recognized influence in the progression; and itis 
here that the system demands the most from the teacher; without a good knowledge in 
this direction he becomes worse than useless. No movement is attempted unless the 
previous ones of the same kind have been thoroughly practiced; and no exercise is used 
whose commencing position has not already been practiced sufficiently to guaranty its 
correctness; for, if the commencing position is faulty, the movement can not be rightly 
executed. e 
The Swedish method does not disapprove of chest-weights, dumb-bells, and allied 
_ forms of apparatus; but through years of constant practice it leads up to them, claiming 
that before increasing the weight by external means, you should make a progression by 
prolonging the lever of the weight already present. So, for instance, a backward flexion 
of the trunk with the arms extended upward and the hands holding weights must neces- 
sarily be preceded by the same movement without the weights, and that by a flexion 
with the hands fixed behind the neck, and still earlier with the hands on the hips, etc. 
In a like manner the method prepares the way for wsthetical gymnastics, for fencing, 
military drill, and other forms of applied gymnastics, yet insisting that educational gym- , 
nastics form the basis of all these. This is reasonable; for, unless you have learned to 
control the involuntary coérdination of motion, which is the cause of ‘‘ faults’? in gym- 
nastics, you will hardly be able to produce the great voluntary codrdination required in 
all forms of advanced gymnastics. © 
. Now, when you are to put this progression into practice, you will not feel as if grop- 
ing in the dark; for, in this method, the movements have been thoroughly systematized 
and included under distinctive headings, where there is no more a jumble, but where 
the rules of progression can be well carried through by a teacher familiar with the theory 
of gymnastics. After years of practical investigation it was found that if, in every les- 
son, the exercises followed each other in a certain, comparatively unchanging order, the 
movements could be made stronger; they could be given more duration; ill results could 
be completely prevented; and hence the good effects became all the more pronounced. 
For that reason all movements were divided into classes, and this order was made the 
basis for the classification. All the exercises can be included under the various head- 
ings; and within each class—with infinite variety—the exercises grow gradually stronger 
as the pupils develop. 
This classification will be found not only to contain exercises filling the needs of the 
organism, but to correspond to physiological principles aswell. To understand this we 
shall have to consider it a little in detail: 
1. Introductions,—By these we understand some simple exercises used at the begin- 
ning of a lesson to gain a little general muscular control, to correct the base and general 
position, etc. 
2. Arch flexions, which consist of backward flexions of the trunk; they have the effect 
of straightening the dorsal region of the spine; of vaulting the chest forward by draw- 
ing the lower ribs apart, thus increasing the chest capacity; and of cultivating the ex- 
tensibility of the upper region of the abdomen. 
3. Heaving movements, which consist of various exercises in a hanging position, and 
others that have the effect of expanding the upper partof the chest by lifting it upward; 
incidentally they also develop the arms, If these movements, are not preceded by the 
   
-P-A-G-E-680
      _ ally they also expand 608 ‘ EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
arch flexions they will produce lameness in the upper region of the abdomen. Free- 
standing arm extensions are ¢lassified in this group, since their effects resemble those of 
heaving movements, for which they also prepare the way. 
4, Balance movements.—The two preceding exercises are strong, hence they increase 
the heart beat noticeably. Now a rest ought to ensue—the word rest not to be under- 
stood as meaning inactivity, but changed activity—and the time is conveniently filled 
by the gentle movements which we call balance move ments. These require but little 
elfort from any one of the many muscles brought into play; the heart beat is not in- 
creased by thei, but it becomes lessened by the mechanical propulsion of the blood into 
the legs (the more equal distribution of the blood pressure). At the end of a balance 
movement the pupil is again ready for more specific work. 
5, Shoulder-blade movements consist of arm movements which have the effect of placing 
the shoulder-blades in correct position. These exercises are in a measure dependent on 
arch flexionsand heaving-moyements; for, unless the dorsal region of the spine isstraight- 
ened and the upper region of the chest is extensible, but little can be done toward over- 
. coming a “‘stoop.’? i 
6., Abdominal exercises bring into forcible play the abdominal walls; their effects are 
to incite peristalsis, to promote digestion, and to shorten the stay of the food in the in- 
testinal canal. } 
7. Lateral trunk movements consist of rotations and sideways flexions, etc. , of the trunk. 
They have a far-reaching effect on the general circulation by accelerating the flow in 
the inferior vena cava, leading the blood off from the abdomen and legs, ete. - Incident- 
the chest laterally and strengthen the musclés around the waist. 
8. Slow leg movements,—By this time the heart-beat'is again much increased; theslow 
leg movements furnish a means of lessening it. For, by these the blood becomes me- 
chanically propelled forward, through the forcible, passive extension of some muscles, 
while others are in gentle, active contraction. These movements may be conveniently 
omitted when the previous exercises are not strong enough to make them a necessity. 
9, Jumping and vaulting.—These exercises have the effect of cultivating the general 
elasticity of the body more than does any other form of movement. And if we recall 
that grace and elasticity are very nearly identicalin gymnastics, we understand the gym- 
nastic need of these movements. But they also have practical value; for we are often 
called upon to jump; and if it so happens, it is wellto know how. They develop courage, 
self-reliance, a true appreciation of space, and produce great ability of voluntary codrdi- 
nation of motion as well. ‘The Swedish method differs from all others (not founded on 
it) in its manner of preparing the jumping by practising the intermediate positions, be- 
fore the real movement is attempted, as well as in demanding that correct ‘‘landing”’ 
should be insisted upon. In like manner the vaulting is prepared by tirst cultivating 
in the pupil the habit of clinging to the bar, no matter what happens, before he is madé 
to leap over it. And the progression is so strict that we have no accidents to record in 
these “violent”? or precipitate movements. 
10. Respiratory exercises.—These consist of deep inhalation and exhalation accompa- 
nied by some arm movement that will expand and contract the chest in even rhythm 
with the respiratory act. The movements, which can be conveniently combined with 
some movements of the legs or trunk, have the effect of restoring free respiration (the 
jumping putting the pupil out of breath) and to lessen the heart beat. Respiratory ex-      
* ercises are brought in not only at the end of every lesson, but at any time when their 
effects are needed, and often also at the beginning of a lesson containing strong exercises 
that require an increased amount of oxygen. 
To this daily curriculum various additions are often made, such as to bring in one 
more shoulder-blade movement, when needed; or another heaving movement; oran ab- 
dominal exercise; or leave the last one entirely out for children, and so on—as the 
teacher may decide. % 
Tn addition to the free-standing movements, each class contains numberless exercises 
on apparatus, and supplies a sufficient number to form a progression from early infancy 
to well-developed manhood—through all the grades in school and college, and in after 
life as well. 
The third point in which the Swedish system differs from the majority of others is in 
the method of applying the exercises. 
The movements are applied to words of command, this being the only method ena- 
bling the pupil to concentrate his mind on one thing ata time, that thing being his own 
movement, Thisisin accordance with the definition of gymnastic movemen t, which tells 
us that unless a movement is done with full volition it ceases to be gymnastic, In 
those methods which use imitation, memorizing, ete., the movements become mechani- 
cal, the pupil dividing his attention between himself and something outside him, i.e, 
they cease to be gymnastic. \ 
Objections have been raised to using words of command, because ‘‘it is too tiresome,” 
    
-P-A-G-E-681
   PHYSICAL TRAINING. 609     “too soldier-like,’”’ ete. To this we can answer that to get the full recreation and rest 
ut of exercise we should put our whole mind into it, this being much less tiresome 
than to exercise while we think of something else. On the one hand we have the theory 
asmallwinority of antagonists, that gymnastics without music do not give enough 
reation, especially to children, because there is not enough exhilaration in such ex- 
sises; on the other hand we have the statement of a large majority of children and 
others who have tried gymnastics to music as well as to words of command, the chil- 
dren saying that there is ‘‘much more fun”? in the latter, and the adults that there is 
‘*much more to them.’’ As for the second objection, we claim that discipline is nec- 
essary not only for asoldier but for everybody, if we are to haveany control whatsoever 
over ourselves; and hence discipline should form a part of everybody’s education. 
Words of command have other advantages. They teach the pupil to think quickly; to 
act as quickly and to doa thing in the shortest possible time. This is no little gain in 
the present age of present age of hurry and competition. Besides, the use of commands 
enables the teacher always to keep his class ‘‘in hand;’’ it becomes easier for him not 
only to teach, but to correct as well. 
The Swedish method disapproves utterly of the use of music, for the very simple rea- 
son that but few gymnastics move ments are rhythmical, and cannot be made to 
be so without sacrificing the movement. On the other hand, every gymnastic move- 
ment has a rhythm of its own, which, however, distinctly differs from the rhythm of 
music, If music were to be used, its rhythm would have to change at every motion, 
and I doubt if any player, even a Rubinstein, would be able to make it do so, Take, 
for instance, such a movement as ‘‘ preparation to jumping ’’ (consisting of (1) heel ele- 
vation, (2) knee flexion, (3) knee extension, (4) lowering of the heels;) the first motion 
is exceedingly quick; the second moderately quick; the third comparatively slow; and 
the fourth still slower. Now, where is the music to fit such a movement? 
A recent lecturer on gymnastics made the somewhat ‘startling statement that ‘‘the 
arm movements are not gymnastics (for example: arms extended sideways, in front, above 
the head, ete.)’? If that teacher had said *‘arm movements done to music are not 
gymnastics,’’ the statement would have been correct. . For Jetus investigate these arm 
extensions, Starting with arms hanging down, they consist of flexion upward of the 
forearm, a movement occurring slowly from beginning to end—if it is to be done cor- 
rectly—and extension in any direction, which movement, once started, occurs with 
great and accelerating speed. Now, if this is done to music, the flexion takes place so 
quickly that the forearm rebounds and gives the intermediate position of semi-flexion 
instead of complete flexion. In consequence thereof the extensors are not in the state 
of complete relaxation which should exist before they are made to contract, and their 
contraction will not be as forcible nor as quick as it ought to be. Besides, the music 
will give it the same speed as it gives to the flexion, which is entirely wrong. In most 
fiexions a great many comparatively strong muscles perform the motion, hence these 
movements must occur slowly; whereas the extensions are executed by few and com- 
paratively weaker muscles, hence they can and should occur more quickly than the 
‘exions. This is especially evident in the arm extensions just mentioned, and when 
they are done to music their gymnastic form always has to be sacrificed, #4. ¢, they 
cease to be gymnastics. In alike manner we could investigate all other gymnastic 
movements and with the same result in all except a few oscillatory movements, like walking, running, etc. 
Besides, when exercising to music, the pupil will be found to pay more attention to 
the rhythm of the music than to the form of the movement (if we presume that the 
latter could be made rhythmical), and we get the same result as in all cases where work 
is done with divided attention—one of the things has to be sacrificed for the other. 
From the above it will be seen that the system is rational, since it: seeks a reason for 
everything that it uses or adopts; it makes theory and practice harmonize. But it ig 
practical as well; for it does not rely on elaborate apparatus for existence, since the ex- 
ereises, not the apparatus, constitute the system. The movements can be taken any- 
where where there is sufficient floor space to stand on and sufficient oxygen in the air. 
On the other hand, though the system prefers its own apparatus, the exercises can be 
most easily adapted to apparatus belonging to other systems, or to such simple means 
as ordinary chairs and desks, or other furniture. Though apparatus 1s desirable, it is 
not absolutely necessary for good physical development, especially in gymnastics for 
children. . 
Whatever its deficiencies, the system has not only survived on its own merits, in spite 
of the close scrutiny to which it has been subjected by gymnastically learned men all over the world, but it has finally been adopted in every country where its principles 
have been thoroughly tested, even conservative England having at last yielded. 
Before closing, [ take occasion to warn you against confounding Swedish educational 
gymnastics with medical gymastics, commonly known as ‘‘ Swedish movement cure; ??

Uaioe based, on the same principles, the two are entirely different, Rok only as to 
their purposes, ‘but i in the exercises used as well. 
The system needed for our schools,—Dr. Jay W. Seaver, of Yale Uhiveraity: I believe 
that if we adopt this [Ling] system we must modify it. Whatever system we take, it 
must be adapted to the circumstances in a scientific way, so that we may get results 
that shall mean something. If we make mistakes we can again change and modify. 
That is the peculiar genius of America. We are not afraid to try something new, to 
launch out into seas before unknown tous. If we make mistakes we easily repair 
them. ‘The system for your schools must be something entirely different from that of 
our colleges. The work that Dr. Hitchcock is doing at Amherst, Dr. Sargent is doing 
at Harvard, and Dr. Hartwell is doing at Baltimore, is very different from what is 
demanded in the primary, grammar, and high schools. The conditions are different. 
They work for men who have reached years of intelligence, who are old enough to have 
judgment and regard for their own physical welfare. If a course of work is marked out 
for them, they will follow it. But you cannot do this with children. They donot know 
what is best for themselves and they do not care, and as we are crowding them five hours 
in the day and five days in the week with mental work, we must provide something for 
their physical welfare. We must build them up physically and give an outlet to the 
nervous energy which is driving them on day after day, and making old men and women 
of them before they are out of their teens. 
What will the Swedish system do? I believe one criticism can be made that is fair 
and honest—that it requires too much mental attention. The pupil must have his 
attention centered on the instructor all the time. ‘The pupil has all the time to watch 
for the word of command. * * * Is this an insuperable objection to the Swedish 
system? I think not. I Iehieve that some of these gentlemen who are so successful as 
teachers will see the ae of America, and will modify that certainly objectionable 
phase. i 
Some essential features of school gymnastics.—Dr. W. G. Anderson, of the Brooklyn 
School for Physical Training: The so-called American system is as scientific as that of 
Ling. Why should it not be? We begin where he stopped; we have his experience. 
Ihave much respect for the German and Swedish systems; I have had experience in 
both; but, taken as they are, they will not suit the American people. We have ideas 
of our own, and it is not often that methods of other countries will suit us, unless they 
are modified. I believe in music. My experience has shown me that as good results 
can be obtained from many exercises if accompanied by appropriate music. If two 
classes take the same movements, one class working to an accompaniment played by an 
‘ expert (for it requires an expert to play for gymnastics), the other class drilled by count- 
ing or thumping on the floor witha stick, how can you provethat music.has been detri- 
mental in one case, while the counting was beneficial in the other? Did the fife and 
drum have any effect on the tired soldiers during the war? I have not found that the 
exhilaration caused by music in gymnastics hasinterfered with the muscular or nervous 
training of children. We do not, of course, do everything to music, but many of the 
lighter exercises can be thus executed; and I haye yet to hear an argument that will 
convince me that such gymnastic. training suffers by music. This work is. to goon in 
the schools. I hardly think it will be a success if pupils are obliged. to exercise in the 
space between the desks, while the regular teacher leads them. 
In the first place, we do not associate physical culture with a small space: Room is 
required. The aisles will of necessity limit the number of exercises, while, in the second 
place, I do not believe the regular teacher can or will spare the time to learn the science 
of physical training, that she may teach gymnastics to/her pupils. 
Unless Iam greatly mistaken, our teachers have all they cando. Theirtime is spoken 
and paid for. Extra work will involve additional expense. I admit that a few enthu- 
siastic teachers will start the work in their schools, but I doubt if they keep it up. It 
is not for a week or month; itis for years, day afterday. I would suggest.that the base- 
ments be cleared out, well ‘heated, lighted, and ventilated, equipped with appliances for 
light gymnastics, a special teacher engaged, and the pupils sent to her from fifteen to 
thirty minutes a day. 
The instructor of gymnastics, being a specialist, can do better work than the regular 
teacher, who would be compelled to learn two professions if she were to supervise the 
work and teach itas itshould be taught. I believe that the system adopted by the Bos- 
ton public schools must be an eclectic one. It must embrace the best ideas of all known 
methods. The unmodified Swedish and German systems are not so attractive to Ameri- 
cans as the same arrangements changed to suit our likes and dislikes. Thesystem itself 
will not produce the results, but the way the system is taught. I believe that perfec- 
tion exists only in the mind. {four system is perfect, we can only approach this high 
standard by the best-known methods of imparting knowledge. All the country will 
watch the Boston schools if they eaupt physical training as a “part of their regular cur-

riculum, because of their reputation in mental work, If these schools are going to give 
but a few minutes each day to gymnastics, and the work be confined to the aisles, we 
shall not have grand results. Ifa mental branch requires one houra day, then why not

VIII.—PRIVATE AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 
Relation of the State te private schools. —State Commissioner Thos. B. Stockwell, of Rhode 
Island: In the last report of the board this topic was touched upon with reference to 
its importance and the fact that at present the State was in posséssion of no direct knowl- 
edge whatever as to the scope or character of their work, or of the number of children 
actually reached by them. I have thought of the question considerably, and while I 
am well aware of the difficulties which beset anything that looks like State interference 
with private enterprises of any kind, and especially with this one of education, I do be- 
lieve it is possible to devise an arrangement whereby the present state of chaos and ig- 
norance of all the facts involved may be changed for one of method and accurate state- 
ment of facts. ‘ ; 
I should stand as strongly as anyone for the right, and I may also say the necessity 
in a large community, of private schools to exist. I recognize the parent’s right to de- 
termine the place of his child’s education, but that does not at all interfere with the 
right of the State to be assured that the child is receiving an education. It is no tres- 
pass by the State upon the prerogatives’ of the parent for the former to see to it that 
the latter is fulfilling his duties in this matter, which is fundamental to the existence 
of the State. : 
~ Another reason why some more definite knowledge of the personnel and work of pri- 
vate schools is necessary, is that we may be able to make a more just and accurate judg- 
ment as to the character and extent of the education which our youth are receiving, 
For illustration, last year 9,751 children of school age were reported as attending some 
kind of private schools. Now, we have no way of knowing anything regarding what 
proportion were in primary grades, what in grammar grades, and what in high schools. 
Again, while our public schools report as enrolled in the high and grammar grades some 
3,000 or more who are over fifteen years of age, we have no knowledge whatever of how 
many above that age are in our private schools. So it is apparent at'a glance that our 
present view of the educational work among our youth is very incomplete, ; ‘ 
What we need is an enrollment in each city and town of all private schools, together 
with the course of study adopted in each. Then each school shall be provided by the 
State with the same form of register as is prepared for the public school, and the attend- 
ance should be kept on the same plan. At the end of the yeara return should be made 
by each school to the local school authorities, showing the number enrolled for the year 
and the average attendance, These data could then be returned to the office of the 
commissioner of public schools, where they could be summarized with the other returns 
and we should be able to know much better than we now do just what we were doing 
and what we were leaving undone. Already very many of the private schools have « 
adopted the State register for use, supplying themselves at their own expense, and it is 
believed that all would be very glad to adopt it, especially if it were furnished free. 
If it were not deemed advisable to make this action compulsory I would like to be 
authorized to make the offer of furnishing the registers to such schools as would agree 
+0 make the returns at the end,of the year. A partial knowledge of the facts now un- 
jnown will be a very decided gain, , 
Parents can not be relieved from school taxes.—A. P. Marble, Superintendent of Worcester 
(Mass.) schools, in the New York Independent: If the conscience of a man leads him 
to educate his children in a private school, religious or otherwise, the State need not 
object, provided the child is educated to that moderate extent which the necessities of 
the State require; but this parent can not rightly be relieved from taxes to support 
public schools any more than the man of property without children can be so relieved. 
‘Though he chooses to educate his own children, he is indirectly benefited by the public 
tax to educate other people’s children. It is of value to him that he lives in an edu- 
cated community. He may have no property exposed to fire in the town, but he is 
taxed to support the fire department; he may use well-water exclusively, and yet pay 
taxes for the public waterworks; he may employ a private watchman for his house, 
mill, or store, and yet he must be taxed to support the police. Though he may never 
ride on the highway he must help to keep it in repair. It is thus that we live ina 
commonwealth. And if one man can not rightly be relieved from his school tax or 
other tax no number of men can, E 
  __ Effect of the Australasian ballot system on the school-money question, Edward Wakefield, 
in the Forum: The education question was formerly a burning one in all the [Austral-
-P-A-G-E-684
  b t f i 
612 Als EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. fe | ; : f ¢ # i 
asian] colonies. It was simply a question of whether all the children in the country 
were to be afforded the rudiments of a good secular education at the hands of the state, 
or whether the Roman Catholic clergy were to receive a portion of the public taxes for 
the support of their denominational schools. A great number of Roman Catholic parents 
preferred that their children should attend the public schools, rightly believing that 
they got a better education there than at the clerical schools, and that it was an advan- 
tage to them in life to have heen reared on the same benches with their fellow-citizens 
of other sects. But the Roman Catholic organization was so complete and the influence 
of the priests so strong, that, with open voting, not a Catholic went astray at the polls, 
and the ‘‘block vote’’ was cast solidly against every candidate who had the courage to 
support the national system of education. The ballot entirely changed all that, and the 
question of subsidies to Roman Catholic schools is no longer within the sphere of prac- 
tical politics, Bishop Patrick Moran, a most distinguished prelate, himself stood for 
election on that ticket, and half of his own flock voted against him. Even the church 
has no terrors behind the screen in the ballot booth. 
The State should demand a certain standard.—Edwin D. Mead, of Boston, Mass., in the 
New York Independent: The State should demand that every ‘private school, sectarian 
or other, maintaina certain standard of education, and should make provision to see 
that this requirement is met; but in its enforcement there should be no officious med- 
dling, and none is necessary. 
Perpetuating distinctions,—Hon. Chas. D. Hine: The common school has been the 
means of fusing the creeds and languages that meet in our State. If any part of the 
youth are to be permanently segregated in peculiar schools, the merging of the different 
parts will cease, and the distinctions of years be unfortunately perpetuated. 
Should sectarian schools be examined by the State?—Bishop John J. Keane, rector of the 
Catholic University, in the New York Independent: I consider dangerous to our country’s 
welfare, and contrary to her spirit, the tendency to absolute centralization and monop- 
oly, whether in education or in aught else that concerns the public weal. I deprecate 
as antagonistic to real progress every system that would ‘hinder competition and crush 
out individual enterprise. I detest any system of eSpionage prompted by mere secta- 
rian bigotry or sectional narrowness. Yet I heartily believe in the unification of all the 
elenients that come to make up our people, and inevery just and reasonable means tend- 
ing to that unification. I cordially sympathize with those who have no welcome for 
any element that would not aim at blending with our popular unity and sincerely ac- 
cepting our country’s Constitution in its letter and in its spirit. Now,views may differ 
as to how far legislative action may be needed to secure this, For my part, I am quite 
convinced that there resides in the American people a vital force and influence which 
of itself assimilates each element, and that legislative interference is as little necessary 
for securing the result as it is necessary for securing that the trees of our forests shall 
’ assimilate the elements sucked up by their roots or that the ocean shall assimilate to it- 
self the drops that fall into its bosom. 
The only logical answer to the Catholic demand.—N. Y. Journal ‘of Commerce: The 
Catholic says with truth and evident sincerity that he believes religious training to be 
the chief part of education, The common school does not pretend to furnish such 
-training, and he is compelled therefore to withdraw his children and to educate them in 
parochial institutions. If all taxation for educational purposes is abandoned, he has 
nothing to say; but if schools are to be supported by public funds, then exempt him 
from taxation or give him his proportion of the money to educate his children in his 
ownway. He offers to subject his schools to any test as to their efficiency and good 
conduct as a condition of the appropriation. He objects, very justly, to pay for the sup- 
port of schools where no faith is taught, and from which he can derive no benefit, and 
then to be compelled to support wholly at his own expense theschools to which he must 
send his children. If we are asked whether we favor the appropriation of the public 
money to support such sectarian schools, we answer with a decided negative. But we 
dosay that if a Romanist is taxed to support a school which is a stench in his nostrils, 
and the godless character of which is essential to the fairness of the system, then he is 
justly entitled to a proportion of the fund thus raised for the school which by all that 
he holds sacred he is compelled to patronize.- The common schodl outgrew its useful- 
ness and its right to exist at the public expense atthe moment it ceased to give the young 
committed to it a trainingin the fear of God. When the teachers could not carry on 
this, the very highest part of all proper education, the schools should have been left, 
_ as the churches were, to the voluntary support of the people. This is the only logical 
and consistent answer to the Catholic demand for school money. Let them educate 
their children in their own schbols at their own expense, and make no demand upon 
them to support any other school.

The Canadian example should point the way.—J. A. J. McKenna: Sufficient prominence 
is not given by Catholic writers to the’ example afforded by Canada in the successful 
working of the dual systems of State and denominational schools. ‘To those citizens 
who fancy that they see in the establishment of parochial schools a danger to the. com- 
menwealth an examination of the school system of Ontario would be quite a revelation. 
They would find that in that very Protestant province the law provides, and has for 
almost half a century provided, for the establishment and maintenance of a class of 
schools similar to those which they regard with such dismay. On further inquiry they 
would learn that in by far the greater part of the entire Dominion of Canada correspond- 
ing Jegal provisions are made. And yet Canada‘has gone on and prospered! To those 
non-Catholics who perceive the dangers of the godless system of education the Canadian 
example should point the way to a remedy; and to Catholics who at so great a sacrifice 
are founding and supporting parochial schools it might suggest some plan of campaign 
for the removal of the injustice under which they labor. What has been done in Canada 
should be within the realm of the feasible in that country which is called the land of 
the free. What works for good in Ontario could not possibly have a directly opposite 
effect across the imaginary line. 
Managed without a particle of denominational friction. —J. B. Somerset, superintendent 
of Protestant schools of Manitoba: This fundamental principle [that of separate Protest- 
ant and Roman Catholic schools] being embodied in the imperial and Dominion acts for 
the organization of the province, the question as to its correctness is outside the scope of 
practical discussion; but in. connection with its workings during the last seventeen 
years it may be pointed out that the schools of the province have been managed without 
aparticle of the denominational friction that has caused disturbances and bitterness in 
other provinces of the Dominion. Our Roman Catholic fellow-citizens have, under this 
law, their own schools, available for religious as well as secular teaching, which isa 
principle invariably contended for by them; and those charged with the management 
of them are accountable to their people for their efficiency. On the other hand, Prot- 
testant schools are untrammeled in the introduction of such Christian teaching, inglud- 
ing the daily reading of the Bible, as may be found practicable, and which the groWing 
sentiment of the people recognizes as holding an important place in the development of 
the child’s nature. 
What should be required of private schools.—A. P. Marble, superintendent of Worcester, 
(Mass.) schools, in the New York Independent: If it is the right and duty of our State 
to provide for education, if compulsory school laws are right and proper, then it follows 
that every private school, sectarian or otherwise, should be required in the interést of 
the child to give at least'that modicum of education which the State demands. There 
can be but one supreine authority in this matter of education; and this authority must 
be the State. 
Objections of the Catholics to the public schools.—Rt. Rev. James McGolrick, bishop of 
Duluth, in reply to State Superintendent Kiehle, of Minnesota: We hold that ignorance 
when avoidable, is sin; that it is often a fruitful source of crime. But we must not for- 
get the fact that the child who learns to know and love and serve God, and thereby 
save his immortal soul, knows more of value than the most cultured infidel philosopher; 
the very best of us in our honest moments having to confess our ignorance of many 
things. 
With such necessary preface, I proceed with entire frankness to answer the questions 
you embody in your letter. First. ‘‘Do you recognize it as the duty of American citi- 
zeus of the Catholic faith to support the public-school system in that spirit of loyalty 
with which they support other departments and institutions of the Government ?’’ 
if you ask me ‘‘Ought Catholics to support a system of common free schools?’’? I 
would say without hesitation they ought to support and should be in favor of such free 
schoois; but when you ask ‘‘Ought they tosupport the present public school system?” 
I answer that there are certain obstacles in the way of conscientious Catholics availing 
themselves of these schools as at present constituted, and I trust you will give them 
kindly consideration. 
It is the duty of the State to foster and encourage education; but the parent is by 
divine right the natural educator; to the family belongs this highest mission, and the 
parent must not be ousted from his right, but assisted in his efforts to educate, that 
government being best which interferes least. Here is a principle for which Catholics 
haye striven amidst much persecution, and the liberty loving American people will yet 
thank the church for her action in preventing the encroachment of the State on the rights 
of her citizens. Of course, the State could take due action in case of the criminal neg- 
lect of parents in the education of their children; itis the right and duty of the State to 
see that such education is given, hut to form the good citizen, this is the work of parent, 
religion, aud school. Mere mention of the gradual change that has taken place in the
-P-A-G-E-686
  614 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-8). : ; ‘ 
public-school Ce from the date of its inception raises up in my mind memories of 
many outspoken lovers of this country, non-Catholics, who warn us of this fatal ten- 
deucy of the State to interfere with the rights of the minority, to forget the principles 
- of the-Constitution, and seek to forée conscientious citizens into abject compliance with 
compulsory laws. | y ¢ 
While the public-school system is worthy of praise for its efforts to provide secular 
education, a very large body of citizens believe that such education is incomplete and 
ineffective without religious instruction. All are agreed on the necessity of religious 
instruction; but here comes the important difference between us. Is the Sunday school 
sufficient, with home training, to meet the wants of thechild? To this, Catholics answer 
decidedly, *‘No.”? They prove the truth of this answer in two ways: (a) by actual ex- 
perience, for to devote an hour of a Sunday to a crowd of distracted children in some 
stuffy room, and with all the other drawbacks known to Sunday-school teachers, is not 
calculated to impress the children with a lofty idea of the magnitude of the work; neither 
can they thereby appreciate the wonderful words of our Lord and Master, ‘‘ What doth 
it avail a man to gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his own soul?’’ No edu- 
cator would attempt to teach arithmetic after such a method; why should we attempt 
to teach the higher law and the knowledge that pertains to the eternal God in such despica- 
ble fashion? True, there are those whose grasp on revealed truth is very slight, who 
are content that their little ones may grow up without any religious training whatever, 
leaving the children themselves to select their church or belief afterwards; these, of 
course, do not object to the present system. (b) Catholics can judge the tree by its fruits. 
We have had a lengthened experience of, we will not say irreligious, but, at least, unre- 
ligious education, and what is the result? Itis allowed that most men in the United 
States have ceased to be practical believers; they are outspoken in denying the exist- 
ence of God and the soul; many of them are scofling atheists; divorce, drunkenness, 
prostitution and worse forms of impurity, blasphemy, dishonesty, and suicide have gone 
onward until the very thought of the multitude of the crimes against a God of infinite 
patience and mercy makes the head sick and the heart sore. It would be easy to gain 
chedp applause by the declaration that education has taken these evils from us, but 
alas! the naked fact is there, that these and kindred crimes are committed by so-called 
educated people. Far be it from metosay that such crimes are common among a highly 
educated people, but their denial of God’s law has worked its way down to their com- 
paratively uneducated brethren and left its sad consequences. 
‘Then, the public school system under its present rules can not teach Christianity, for 
the Jewish children would be offended and could justly protest. Neither can it teach 
morality, for morality must be founded on religion, and the State can not teach religion. 
There are those interested in the workings of the schools who propose a hybrid 
of morals, a jumble of sentiments from Moses, Buddha, Tom Payne, Benjamin Frank- 
lin, Bob Ingersoll, and Paul the Apostle, but serious men put all that aside as the 
makeshi{t of men who have no religion at heart nor reverence for God, save that which 
is of the ‘‘silent sort.”? Such slipshod methods will not teach the child the controlling 
of strong passions, will not strengthen him against the constant attacks of the world, 
the devil, and the flesh. To many men this is no argument at all; for the world, they 
say, is‘a very good world indeed; the flesh is all they possess, and the devil they rele- 
gate to the myths of the dark ages; but to most Christians the argument has full force. 
The most powerful of all means. for the influencing of life is the school; there the 
character is formed; there the disposition to good is fostered; there the tendency to evil 
is checked—and all this with consequences not only for the brief space of our mortal 
life, but for an eternity.. Is there any wonder, therefore, why parents are so anxious 
about the system of educating their children, and should not such conscientious anxiety 
be respected ? 
You ask in the second place: ‘‘ Have American citizens of the Catholic faith the right 
to exercise their independent judgment, and to send their children to the public school 
when they are satisfied that it is in the best interests of their children?’ 
To this I answer, certainly; they can do so when they are satisfied it is for the best 
interest of their children, But ‘interest’? is a doubtful term.. There are worldly in- 
terests, and ‘‘interests’’ of an eternal importance. With the lanation given above, 
as faithful children of the Catholic Church, they would not sacrifice the eternal inter- 
ests of their children for any worldly interest, and so would not endanger willingly the 
faith of those so dear to them. 
In the third place, you ask: ‘‘Isit the position of the priests of the Catholic Church 
that American citizens of the Catholic faith sending their children to the public schools, 
without permission of the priests, commit sin and forfeit their right to the sacraments 
of the echureh?’’ } a“ wat 
Answer: ‘The lips of the priest shall keep knowledge and they shall seek the law at 
his mouth.”’? The priest is the guardian of the sacraments, and if/there be for his    
     
-P-A-G-E-687
    PRIVATE AND PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS. 615 
flock any proximate danger of sin, they are bound to warn them and prevent, if possi- 
ble; the danger. But it must be remembered that the priest isa member of a living 
church and that he can not, according to his whims and fancies, make laws; his busi- 
ness is to act according to the laws made by the church, and interpret and condemn as 
she interprets and condemns. uh 
From all this you can readily understand that while we rejoice at the spread of edu- 
cation, Catholics maintain that an additional element is wanting to complete the great 
work of forming good and true citizens, and this must somehow be supplied. In Canada, 
perhaps soon to be an integral portion of ourgreat Republic, the difficulty is admirably 
solved. i 
Secular schools not godless; source of crime.—State Superintendent D. L. Kiehle, of Min- 
nesota, in reply to Bishop McGolrick: I first give my hearty indorsement to your estimate 
of the family, and its essential place in the constitution of society. I likewise agree with 
you that any education that denies man’s duties and relations to God and eternity is és- 
sentially defective. I believe that our American Governmentis the maturest fruit of our 
purest family and religious character, and that it would be nothing Jess than suicidal 
for the State in any way to dwarf or corrupt the life of either. But the ease is not | 
whether the State shall authoritatively interfere as between the parent and his children, 
but whether the parent is free to exercise his intelligent and conscientious judgment in 
the education of his children. 
Coming now to the public schools, I can not agree with you that it is impossible in 
the nature of things for the State to provide a secular education for its youth without 
monopolizing their time and attention, preventing their proper religious training, and, 
consequently, meriting the opprobrium of being characterized as ‘‘ godless,’’ 
Our Government, which we believe to be the best in the world, is purely secular, yet 
it has for its corner stones the family and the Christian church, and recognizes its ebli- 
gations to these in the high places accorded to the parent and the minister of religion, 
and in the beneficence of its institutions. It can not, therefore, be called godless be- 
cause secular. In like manner I look upon our public-school system as the maturest 
and most honorable fruit of our Christian civilization, It assumes the existence and 
influence of the family and the Christian’church, and in an atmosphere of purity and 
devotion to high aims begotten at the fireside and the altar, teacher and youth meet to- 
gether to attend to duties and interests they have in common. In the conviction that 
our public schools are but a part of the educational provision made for our American 
youth, I believe that the withdrawal of the influence of our families of intelligence and 
refinement and of the moral support of the Christian churches would defeat their.pur- 
pose and reduce them to a condition which would verify the prediction of their enemies. 
Where the State assumes paternal relations toward any of its children, as in its reform 
school, institutions for defectives and indigents, it makes provision for religious instruc- 
tion, but when it opens the common school near the home and in the parish it assumes 
that the children will bring with them for use and assimilation in charagter a knowl- 
edge of the truths of religion and morals. If it is objected that this is not the actual 
condition of things, I reply that the State is obliged to assume the existence of both as 
essential to its own existence as well as that of its schools. 
Noticing next the opinion that the moral eyils and heinous sins that seem to be so 
abundant, some of which you have named, are the legitimate fruit of our public-school 
system, I must emphatically deny the statement as one that can not be proven. ‘This 
is a charge repeatedly made, and generally believed by Catholics, and one that I believe 
to be very unjust, indeed, as unjust as if these evils were charged to our republican 
form of government, or to the Protestant reformation. This being a matter of greatest 
moment I should be glad to join you in submitting to persons of impartial and scientific 
ability the following inquiries: (1) To what nationalities and religions do these enemies ' 
belong, viz, inmates of prisons, workhouses, and reform schools, the licentious, drunk- 
ards, and drunkard makers? (2) To what religious and social influences were they 
subjected in youth, and what portion of their training was received in the public schools? 
We shall then have facts to which all parties can appeal, and whatever warning there 
may be in them against dangerous tendencies or policies of government good citizens 
will listen to and heed. 
That our school system is imperfect and in many cases very unsatisfactory can not be 
denied; yet it may be said for it, as we have to say of the Christian church in various 
periods, that it expresses the high-water mark of the moral and intellectual condition 
of the people. 
Morals may be taught.—I see no practical difficulty in a more formal inculeation of the 
recognized principles of Christian morality. The reasonableness of them, and the moral 
beauty of the character that, represents them so commend them that they are as reason- 
ably accepted as the truths of natural religion. But far more important is the careful 
training of youth in habits and tastes as to temperance, purity, and charity, that make   
   
-P-A-G-E-688
      616 ke ‘ EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. r t 
character as distinguished from profession; and in this I believe the public schools are 
doing valuable service. f i 5 
Respecting the provision which should he made for religious instruction outside the 
public school, and your eritigisin of the average Protestant Sunday school, I think you 
are substantially correct, and that the religious instruction of Protestant youth deserves 
far better provisions than it has yet received. This evil, however, is not the fault of 
the public schools, but rather in defective methods, which consume time with little in- 
crease of knowledge. i 
The remedy.—Finally, as to the remedy proposed, the only one, so far as Iam informed, 
that would be satisfactory to the Catholic clergy is the one referred to by yourself, the 
division of the school funds, allowing religious bodies to take charge of their own schools, 
If this plan is ever considered it must be shown to be in the interest of society and for 
the well-being of the whole state, and not merely the desire of a part to be relieved 
from what are recognized public and governmental responsibilities, 
But without undertaking to consider the objections to this plan it seems to me that 
we have entered upon times in which the people are determined upon entire and inde- 
pendent control of their government affairs, without a king and without alliance with 
the church. And as the future state is in the youth of to-day the logical result will be 
that the state will provide for the education of its youth in secular matters. This is 
not the doctrine of a sect or party. It is in the age, historic—in Italy and Brazil as it 
is in Minnesota and Mexico. I therefore believe our public-sehool system is as logical 
and therefore as permanent as our free government. I will also venture the prediction 
that the venerable church which you represent, and which has astonished the world by 
its maryelous adaptation to a form of free government which it never approved in 
theory, will, when our public-school system appears as an accomplished fact, show a like 
power of adaptation without sacrificing the religious instruction of its children. 
In any event I am, with you, confident of a final and just solution. I am also confi- 
dent that it will be histori¢ rather.than controversial, and that it will be best promoted 
by a considerate and dispassionate comparison of experiences and observations and a 
patient waiting for the leavening influences of truth and reason. 
The position of the Catholics. —Rejoinder of Bishop McGolrick to Superintendent Kiehle: 
Catholics declare again and again that they have no desire to break up the public-school 
system, that they are rejoived at all education tending towards good, but that as at 
present constituted that system is both imperfect and insufficient. 
There is no mistaking the voice of the church; she speaks with no uncertain sound, 
telling her children that for the preservation of religion the schools must also be relig- 
ious, her fundamental principle being that we must seek first the kingdom of God and 
his justice. : 
To add cogency to the church’s argument we have the experience of many years and 
in many countries, and it is briefly this, that of those Catholic children who attended 
entirely secular schools, while they did not become Protestants, yet a large number be- 
came both careless and indifferent to all religion, ceasing to be practical Catholics, and 
while generally known as ‘‘smart,’’ their ‘‘smartness’’ was neither to the benefit of the 
state nor of their neighbors, 
Crime, too, increased in proportion far more than our population, and all this while 
secularists were crying out that we had found in our common-school education.the sures 
prevention of all crime, ( 
Here was a fact sadly apparent to us all. We put aside for the present all considera- 
tion of the causes of that increase, remarking merely that your challenge to appeal to 
statistics carefully prepared will be taken up at another time. With the full force of 
these facts before them Catholics, therefore, proceeded to build up their own institu- 
tions of learning, and in the face of a great injustice have gone on quietly, as best they 
can, not only to support these but to maintain out of their scanty means hospitals, 
asylums, and houses for the poor and aged, bearing a double tax for conscience’ sake. 
It is axiomatic that all who pay taxes ought to share in the benefits of taxation, yet 
in answer to the candid and conscientious objections of Catholics what drivel is it to tell 
them that the schools are open to them, or that they must come to be educated accord- 
ing to the present notions of a majority; the strange thing, here also evident, that those 
who are loudest in their cries for nonsectarianism are themselves members of sectarian 
churches. 
Do we then seek to control the public schools? No. 
Do we try to force our religion on unwilling people? Again no, We seek freedom 
in the natural and divine rights of parents to educate their children in the Christian re- 
ligion, and in the way we deem best for their highest interests. 
Secular education not enough.—It may be said that arithmetic and geography have-no 
more todo with religion than the building of a house or the making of a shoe, but all
-P-A-G-E-689
  PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 617 
these things have more to do with conscience than may be at once apparent; fora man 
may build a house so dishonestly that in a short time it will topple over and kill those 
who dwell therein, or he may make a shoe that on the first wet weather may show its 
paper sole. 3 
“ Grammar,’? says Cardinal Newman, ‘‘ does not at first sight appear to admit of a 
perversion, yet Horne Tooke made of it the vehicle of his peculiar skepticism. Law 
‘would seem to have enough to do with its own clients and their affairs, and yet Mr. 
Bentham made a treatise on judicial proofs a covert attack on the miracles of revela- 
tion.. And in like manner physiology may deny moral evil and human responsibility; 
geology may deny Moses, and logic may deny the Holy Trinity; and other sciences, 
now rising into notice, are, or will be, victims of similar abuse.” 
The acceptable plan.—Catholics then look for an equal distribution of the burdens and 
the benefits, and point out the means adopted to this end in countries situated as we 
are. In Austria and Hungary the rights of the non-Catholics are respected by afford- 
ing to them schools in which Protestant religious instruction is imparted together with 
secular knowledge. In Belgium, in Canada, in England, they have found it to be for 
the best interests of the state to give such opportunities as will permit the character of 
the pupil to be deeply impressed by religious influences in the schools. There are no 
people in the world more tolerant than the Catholics of the United States; holding pub- 
lic positions all over this broad land they are ever on the side of popular liberty, and if 
there be danger in our institutions it will not come from Catholies, properly educated, 
but from irreligious men brought up under secular influences. The best Catholic will 
be the best American. Most Protestants of all forms of religion are satisfied with the 
present secular system, but there are nearly twelve millions of Catholics who are far 
from being content; what then will satisfy them and yet keep the free schools intact? 
The following plan may be worth consideration: Let State inspectors be appointed to 
examine the children in Catholic schools, and taking the grade now general in publie 
schools, allow result fees only for those children who have passed the required examina- 
tion in secular studies. Furthermore, let these same inspectors give certificates of com- 
petency only to those Catholic teacher$ who can pass a strict examination, oral or writ- 
ten, in the subjects they are required to teach, placing such qualified teachers on equal 
footing witb the present public-school teachers. Let these inspectors see that the re- 
quired standard of education be well kept, and that schoolhouses, furniture, and appa- 
ratus be in good order. ‘The collection of school taxes is in no way changed, and while 
all who are satisfied with the present system of public schools can continue to enjoy 
their benefit, those who are conscientiougly opposed to them will, at all events, under 
State supervision, educate to the appointed grade. Catholics will answer for it that 
while the religious and moral habits of the pupils are cared for they will not be behind 
in secular knowledge. . There are details in connection with this plan which of course 
can not be entered into here; but be assured that no one will join more heartily ina 
proper adjustment of this grave question than the present writer.

What education the district school should give.—Superintendent W. E. Anderson, of Mil- 
waukee: When the boy graduates from the district school he is supposed to have the 
following knowledge and ability: 
First. He should read English intelligently and intelligibly upon all common sub- 
‘jects of knowledge—history, geography, and general literature. He should be able to 
read a newspaper editorial, a magazine article, a poem, a popular lecture, and to give 
it such expression as will evince his understanding of the thought presented by the au- 
thor. He should havea fairly accurate knowledge of the Constitution of the United 
States, the general plan or the practical workings of the Government as shown in the 
organization of Congress, and the manner of electing the President, his powers and du- 
ties as distinguished from the business of the legislature; and further, he should un- 
derstand the necessity and importance of legal tribunals, before which facts and laws 
are considered. He should know something of his prerogatives as a citizen, his duties 
and rights as regards the exercise of franchise. These subjects are explained in connec- 
tion with the reading of the United States Constitution. Further than this, he should 
be able to express himself upon any subject upon which he has accurate knowledge or 
definite opinions, aud heshould do this in conformity with the established rules of lit- 
erary form—punctuation, capitalization, spelling, ete. Moreover, he should be able to 
use such phraseology and construction as would enable him to hold intercourse with the 
business world in discussing matters of fact or conveying information upon any subject 
in which he may hereafter become interested for culture or business. 
Second, He should express himself intelligently in English; he should have a ready   
 
-P-A-G-E-690
  618 : _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89, ne f 4 
and correct facility in ordinary computations—the fundamental rules, with ‘he common 
method of calculating interest, the use of decimals, the ‘principles of reduction and 
fractions, and the essentials of mensuration—not learned by rule, but deduced from 
manual practice and observation. Added to this training, he should have a clear un- 
derstanding of the elements of bookkeeping, as shown in the plain principles of double- 
entry system applied to ordinary business, where the significance of debit and credit, 
and the relationship of the common principles of accounts are established on this basis 
of debit and credit, He should be able to exemplify his knowledge of this branch by 
writing upa simple set of books containing from twenty to thirty items of a miscella- 
neous nature and involving elementary calculations in the sale and purchase of lots of 
goods, 
Third. Every child leaving school should understand the large facts of geography and 
history. These branches afforda value in which the child gets his earliest culture. From 
the one he gets his first notion of the world about him, the earth and its relation to 
other planets, andthe universe, as explained upon the authority of scientific observa- 
tion; the divisions of the earth into land and water; the nature of its surface, the vari- 
ations of climate and the resulting facts of vegetation and influence upon human life, 
the important facts of commercial geography, and the knowledge of those physical laws 
as exemplified incommon natural phenomena. These are all essential to the education 
of the young citizen. eae, at the same time, be put into possession of the his- 
_ tory of his own country. In this field his patriotism is developed, love for his native 
Jand is nurtured, and he is peter able to understand his own relationship to his country. 
Why public schools are necessary.—Superintendent Fred M. Campbell, of Oakland: One 
of these notions is that the training of a boy’s hands toa particular trade is of equal import- 
ance, to the State, with the education of his mind. The truth of the matter is simply this: 
Such a training of the hands is a good and useful thing, especially to the individual con- 
cerned, and there are a number of pressing necessities which will drive men up to this; 
but the education of the mind is an absolutely indispensable thing for the well-being of 
the State; and yet there are no such immediate pressing urgencies felt by the individ- 
ual.and driving him up to furnish this to his children. Accordingly, while the one can 
be left to the individual, the other must be secured, beyond all peradventure, by the 
State. Mark the essential difference: the necessity of getting a living forces itself upon 
every man, for his own, immediate, selfish interest. The necessity of educating his 
children has no such visible urgency upon the ignorant man; that is for the interest of 
others, rather than his own selfish interest; and the consequences, even to them, are too 
remote and far reaching to be appreciable by his dull mind. Nodoubt theState would 
be better off for having an abundance of skilled artisans, but intelligent men it must 
_ have, or it is on the broad road to ruin. 
Must be based on business principles. —State Superintendent James H. Rice, of South 
Carolina: Educational methods can only reach the necessities of a people when based 
upon wise business principles, The people must be educated into active sympathy with 
any plan thati to train theirchildren. They understand this to be their most important 
duty, and hesitate, properly, to adopt any methods that do not present convincing proof 
of their fitness and permanence. : 
Two schools. —State Superintendent Edwin F. Palmer, of Vermont: There are so many 
points in common between a good schoo] and a poor one, that careful study, in the light of 
educational principles, is absolutely necessary to distinguish the one from the other, except 
in extreme cases, Both are taught by teachers paid by the public, both commence and 
close at the same hour of the day, in both the same books are read and studied, in both 
recitations are conducted, it may be, according to received methods, in both there is the 
same programme and course of study, and yet the one may be nearly worthless, while 
in the other words are spoken and things are done that will long be remembered by the 
scholar, and, perhaps, shape his whole life for good. 
The free school has done this work.—Joseph Jefferson, in the Century: The hissitig and 
jeering that was so liberally bestowed on me will never be vented again in this country 
for so slight an offense. The well-dressed, decorous audience of to-day, when an acci- 
dent oceurs, sit quietly, bearing it with patience and consideration, and when it is righted 
they break forth in encouraging applause. Look at the decorum observed by the vast 
assemblages that go to witness our national games, Disturbancesare very rare. It would 
have been indecorous, if not dangerous, when I was a boy, for ladies and gentlemen to 
visit avy public grounds containing such large masses of people, whereas now they can 
do so with perfect safety. What lies at the foundation of this improvement? People 
went to church in those days as readily as they do now, and the laws were administered 
quite as rigidly. There is only one solution to this problem—the free school has done 
this work,
-P-A-G-E-691
  PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 619 
The studies of the school showd fit, to some extent, for the work of after life.—Jerome 
Allen: There are many intelligent parents who say, ‘‘Of what use are such studies as 
algebra and geometry to my son, who intends to farm?’’ These parents say that the 
extra number of studies crowded into our course of study keep back the development 
ot their children in the right direction. Now, when a parent asks, ‘“‘Of what use is, 
this study to my child, he never intends to use it in after life?’ are we to write this 
man down as a fool ora philosopher?’ We believe that there is more philosophy in this, 
question than many are disposed to admit, Life is short; we can not master everything, 
and you must agree that of two studies which afford equally good mental gymnastics, 
that one which has in it the element of practical utility should be chosen. I disclaim 
all intention of utility or end, but I do claim, and I do not believe that it can be suc- 
cessfully contradicted, that there is philosophy and reason, and thus good practical 
common sense, in the opinions of ordinary thinking men and women, that the studies 
of the school should fit pupils, to some extent, for the work of after life. 
The impending danger.—Superintendent R. W.. Stevenson, of Columbus, Ohio: The 
impending danger of our system of public schools is their expensiveness. , The constantly 
increasing expenditure is in that direction which adds little to the educational power of 
the public schools. The scheme of free text-books is another recruit for ‘‘ bricks against 
brains.’’? In most of the States the amount that can be ievied for school purposes is 
fixed by statute, and in the towns and villages the levy,is generally up to the maximum 
allowed by law. If the cost for education is increased one dollar per capita, ‘that the 
plan of free text-books may be adopted, the result must be the employment of cheaper 
teachers, 
A tmpting field for hobby-horse riders. —J. W. MacDonald, of Stoneham, Mass.: There 
is hardly a week that some society, devoted to the promotion of this or that, does not 
come out with the declaration that this or that must be made a formal part of public 
school instruction. It would almost seem as if it were the prevailing opinion, notwith- 
standing abundant evidence to the contrary, that children out of school hours are in a 
comatose condition, and incapable of receiving any instruction or training whatever. 
The truth is, the large numbers of children gathered daily into schoolrooms furnish 
tempting fields, if access to them can be obtained, to every hobby-horse rider and gib- 
bous-headed reformer for doing what each considers the sine qua non in reforming the 
world. ‘ 
What dampens ardor and chills hope.—Superintendent Z H. Brown, of Nashville, 
Tenn.: That which most dampens ardor and chills hope is the absolute indifference of 
the legislature. Had there been as much money spent by the people in the last decade 
for education as has been used for electioneering purposes, to-day schoolhouses and nor- 
mal colleges would dot the entire State. There are those who-claim to be patriots and 
philanthropists who would cheerfully contribute hundreds of dollars to the campaign 
fund, but would not give one cent to properly equip every boy in the land for citizen- 
ship. Others are willing to give more of their time to elect a constable in their district 
than to secure the services of the best superintendent or teacher in America, though the 
interest of every boy and girl in their county is involved. 
Fit pupils for the lives they are to lead.—Prof. Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen, of Columbia 
College, in the New York Independent: I am emphatically in favor’ of introducing 
manual-training as part of the curriculum of the public schools. I believe that publi¢ 
school instruction should aim to fit the pupils as far as possible for the lives which they 
are likely to lead. The present curriculum, if it has any such aim in view, is lamen- 
tably defective. Itis largely an academic curriculum on a smaller scale, and is catcu- 
lated to stimulate ambitions which life in nine cases out of ten is sure to disappoint. 
The extreme disinclination for manual labor which characterizes American girls, and 
the false and flimsy ideals of the majority of them is, I believe, in a large measure due 
toe the academic character of public school instruction. That girls are meant to be 
wives and mothers, and that this noble calling involves duties and responsibilities of a 
most serious kind, are subjects which are wholly ignored both in the curriculum and in 
the instruction, 
_ Where free education should end.—Moses Merrill, head master of Boston Latin School, 
in the New York Independent: I do not believe it would be wise for the State to furnish 
free education for all pupils through a university course. I think that candidates for 
such a course are aided quite enough already in the preparatory schools. Excepting a 
perfectly developed moral character, there is no possession more valuable than a liberal 
education. Its acquisition should not be without struggle and sacrifice, in order that 
its true worth may be appreciated. Why should this be a free gift tu us any more than. 
anything else which we consider of essential value and worth striving for? 
The State can not demand of the educated man what he has the power to give, but

only receive what he chooses to give; so it Should not confer.upon him gratuitously 
so great & possession, * * * , : 
I think that the law in Massachusetts requiring a high school for a certain number of 
inhabitants a good one. I also think that a separate school for the preparation of pupils 
for college in large cities an exceilent plan, though I would have nothing free in these, 
or high schools, except the instruction. 
Academies haye already been established, incorporated, and endowed in all parts of 
our country. Many of these are in a most flourishing condition, and furnish the train- 
ing which many parents desire for theirchildren. For this reayon the public high schools 
never can displace them, no matter how greatly multiplied, nor should they be incor- 
porated in the public school system. 
  The common school system dangerously assaulted.—Hon. H. W. Blair: It may be that I 
am wild in the thought, but I do think that in this country, at the present time, there 
is a real and a rapidly increasing danger that the free public schools of the country are 
to be or are to-day dangerously assaulted, and that unless the remedy be soon applied 
we shall not be contending with reference to appropriations to support the common school 
at the South, but we shall be contending for the preservation of the lile of the common 
school of the country. I think the great struggle upon us to-day, more real and more 
dangerous than, perhaps, we are apprehending, is this: the danger is between the pa- 
rochial, or denominational, school and the free public school of the country. I believe 
that in the great centers of the country to-day the common school system is dangerously 
assaulted. s 
+ Reiative efficiency of graded and ungraded schools. —Hon. Charles D. Hine, in discussing 
the results of a special examination of the schools of New London County, Conn.: No 
evidence secured in this investigation raises a good graded school abovea good ungraded 
school in point of real efficiency. The reading, writing, arithmetic, and elementary 
science in some country schools are quite equal to anything found in graded schools. 
The problem to be solved.—Supt, W. B. Powell, of Washington, D.C.: The American 
community is more interested in having every child benefited by its schools than it is in 
having the character of its schools improved. Not how high shall we take our schools, 
nor how broad shall we make our courses of instruction, but how may eyery child be 
reached and be made a safer and better member of the community, is the problem to be 
solved. Any movement orinstrumentality that reaches down and uplifts will give value 
to the school system and compensation to the taxpayer. 
What the progress of public schools is due to.—Elizabeth Cady Stanton, in the Arena: 
Local self-government more readily permits of experiments on mooted questions which 
are the outcome of the needs and convictions of the community. 
The smaller the area over which legislation extends the more pliable are the laws. 
By leaving the States free to experiment in their local affairs we can judge of the work- 
ing of different laws under varying circumstances, and thus learn their comparative 
merits. The progress education has achieved in America is due to just this fact—-that 
we have le/t our system of public instruction in the hands of local authorities. How 
different would be the solution of the great educational question of manual labor in the 
schools if the matter had to be settled at Washington! The whole nation might find 
itself pledged to a scheme that a few years would prove wholly impracticable. Not 
only is the town-meeting, as Emerson says, ‘‘the cradle of American liberties,” but it 
is the nursery of Yankee experiment and wisdom. f 
England, with its clumsy national code of education, making one inflexible standard 
of scholarship for the bright children of manufacturing districts and the dall bairns of 
the agricultural counties, should teach us a lesson as to the wisdom of keeping apart 
State and National Government. ‘ i 
Only State action is able to cope with the problem.—State Commissioner Thomas B, Stock- 
well, of Rhode Island: With each recurring year, as the question arises in connection | 
with this annuai report, Whatshall the State do in the matter of education, Iam conscious 
of the feeling that there is in some quarters an openly expressed doubt, and in others a 
latent thought as to the duty or right of the State in these matters. Have such doubts 
a legitimate place in our minds? j : 
Why do we have public schools? Is it not because we know that the intelligence of 
the people determines their condition? But if we recognize this to be true, do we not 
see that it involves the necessity that all the people should be educated? If any one 
portion be neglected, then they become to that extent a source of weakness and danger 
to the whole. Self-protection compels the people, acting as a unit, to provide for uni- 
versal education. If, now, the people have been obliged to undertake this task, what 
limit can they set themselves short of the absolute accomplishment of the undertaking?
-P-A-G-E-693
  PUBLIC SCHOOLS. « 621 
Every dollar which they invest in the work is a bond that they will continue to invest 
until the desired result is secured. 
Up.to this point most citizens will go, but often with a silent interpretation put upon 
the word people, which restricts it to the smallest and most limited unit through which 
the people act. The old notions of local self-government rule with great power, and 
any movements towards the exercise of any authority by a central power are looked 
upon with great disfavor. Now, whatever may have been the early history of popular _ 
education, however seattered and independent may have been the schools of the early 
days of this State, it is unquestionably true that to-day our schools are thoroughly State 
schools, that the ‘authority of the State laws is behind them and under them, that the 
State treasury contributes directly to their support, and, in some towns, to an amount 
nearly if not quite equal to that raised by the town. 
There is no one interest that so permeates all parts of a commonwealth as this one. 
Whenever there may be found lacking in any community that which pertains to good 
citizenship, whether in the line of practical knowledge or of moral character, there is at 
once the place to watch for evil developments, and from that as a senter will emanate 
influences for harm not to be measured. One part of a State can not set itself apart from 
the rest and, pharisaically claiming to be without spot or blemish, remain unharmed. : 
‘The different members of the human body are not more closely united than the dif- 
ferent villages, towns, and cities which make up this little commonwealth, and when 
one suffers all suffer, and when one asamproves, and elevated all are sharers in the im- 
provement. 
This question is not then one for purely local consideration. Itis too large, its ram- 
ifications are too numerous, and the issues at stake too momentous to be allowed to rest 
upon local effort. Only State action is able to cope with the problem, and only State 
interest’can be relied upon to cover the entire field. Nor does the action of theState in 
this matter necessarily paralyze local effort, asissometimes claimed. On the other hand; 
it affords to all parts of the State the opportunity to come together and unite their en- 
ergies for a common purpose, under auspices and with reasonable rea that can 
not exist where the work is undertaken independently and alone, 
It is only as the State takes the control in these matters that we can be sure, first, that 
schools will be provided within reasonable distance of every home; and, second, that the 
schools thus established will be practically equal in the character and quality of the 
education which they furnish. Local power is not infrequently unable to provide the 
proper accommodations; again, for one cause or another, itis unwilling todoso.. Neither 
inability nor indisposition can be allowed to stand in the way of the proper education 
of each and every child who has the capacity for it, What shall be taught and how it 
shall be taught are fundamental questions, and should not be left to the arbitrament of 
local feelings, or judgments even, which are often too narrow both in their premises and 
in their conclusions. A policy must be adopted broad enough to cover the State, 10 meet 
the needs and legitimate desires of all classes, in all conditions of life, and then it must 
be interpreted and enforced through those avd those only who are qualified for the task. 
Teachers and directors, or superintendents, must be amenable in the last analysis to the 
State for their authority and power. 
This system of education is to be wrought out step by step. We have already made 
several advance movements, That of forty-five years ago, when the proprietors’ schools 
were practically abolished, and the system of public schools was instituted, was a long 
step upward towards the ideal we have been discussing. The abolition of the rate biil 
twenty-two years ago, whereby the schools became truly free schools, marks another 
advance. The establishment of the State normal school for the training of suitable 
teachers was a movement towards the same end, looking to a uniform degree of qualifi- 
cations in the teacher’s position. The compulsory laws take hold of the subject upon 
another side and recognize the obligation to bring the children to the schools. Each 
addition which the State has made inits annual appropriation for the support of schools, 
carrying the amount up from $25,000 when the law was first passed to $120,000, the 
amount now paid out each year, has been unmistakable evidence of the growth of this 
thought of the responsibility of the State in these matters. 
Upon this generation rests the duty and privilege of doing its share in the develop- 
ment of that complete system which shall secure to all children the inestimable oppor- 
tunity for acquiring that education which shall enable them to fill every station and 
discharge every duty which life may set before them. Whether we act or not, the 
process of development will go forward, and the result will surely come. But we may 
help it.or we may hinder it. If we are wise and vigilant we shall seize upon every 
opportunity to help the cause onward, for by so doing we hasten the day of universal 
Knowledge, peace, and prosperity.   
  The greatest obstacle to the development of common schoo!s in the South.—President OC. W. 
Dabney, jr., University of Tennessee: The greatest obstruction in the way of a rapid

devslophient, of common schools i in the South consists in the remains of false old politi- 
cal theories. Many of our political leaders give the common schools only a reluctant, 
half-hearted support, because they do not yet believe that they are consistent with their 
theories of government. ha 
Comparative cost of town and istrict systems.—The average cost of education per scholar 
in Connecticut, on the basis of average attendance, is KS 20.82; the average cost per 
Scholar in eighteen of the towns under town management is $1 6. 55, thus showing it to 
be almost 25 per cent. less than under the district system.   
X.—RELIGIous AND MoRAL TRAINING, 
Not taught by lectures or set lessons.—Superintendent J. M. Greenwood, Kansas City, 
Mo.: Moral training, or character training, is regarded in a higher sense than the mere 
training of the intelligence. All the rules of grammar, arithmetic, and all the facts of 
science may be forgotten and the man or woman remain worthy persons; but integrity, 
the power to be right and to do right, must never be forgotten. * * * Whatever 
strengthens the will to resist evil and to do good is moral training. Moral training is 
not taught with much effect by lectures or set Jessons in morals. Conscious will is the 
only true basis of moral action, while weakness of will is the greatest enemy of moral 
culture, The true moral teacher is one who teaches by his acts. f 
The right development of the mind as an intellect.—Hon. John W. Dickinson, Secretary 
Massachusetts State Board of Education: The mind is developed as a moral power by 
turning its attention to the moral quality of its actsand to doing what ought to be done. 
The cultivation of moral habits should be carried on with the cultivation of the intel- 
lect. The relations of school life and the various exercises of the schools provide favor: 
able occasions for the development of the moral nature of the child. The teacher is sup- 
posed to be a model person, worthy of imitation. If this supposition accords with the 
facts, the pupils will be subject to the molding influences of a good example. The 
natural desire and the ability to imitate render the education of the young possible and 
magnify the importance of a good living example, 
The acts of obedience which a wise and efficient school’ government require will’ train 
the pupil to a thoughtful consideration of his conduct and to the habit of self-control. 
The habit of loyalty to the rules and regulations of the school, accompanied with a de- 
sire to promote its welfare, must be cultivated in the minds of the young as a prepara- 
tion for good citizenship. Hence the teaching of the institute includes instruction in 
school government. The exercise of studying by the use of the true method will develop 
the intellect and create in it the power to think so as to discover the truth. The habit 
of independent deliberation before making a choice is most favorable to good morals. 
To create such a habit is the constant aim of the intelligent teacher. 
The relations of pupils in school to one another as a community will offer an opportunity 
for instruction on the subject of publicas wellas private morals. Since the affairs of social 
life are carried on in connection with promises and contracts, and as promises will avail 
nothing if the members of society are not faithful in making them, and do not trust in 
them when made, the teacher should endeaver to impress upon the minds he is attempt- 
ing to develop the infinite value of fidelity to that which is morally right, and the obli- 
gation every member of the school is under to exercise it in all the moral relations he 
holds to others, as well as in all he holds to his own well-being. Such fidelity in the 
relations of social life, and of the life of the individual, is the vital element in all the 
virtues. If successfully cultivated in the minds of the children in our public schools in 
connection with their physical and intellectual instruction, this fundamental virtue will 
appear as a ruling principle in their lives as citizens of the State. The best ideas on the 
moral training of the young are in favor of the right development of the mind as an in- 
tellect, as the only solid foundation for good morals. 
Gladly have him think that the sun went round the earth.—Dr. Arnold, of Rugby: If one 
might wish for impossibilities, I would then wish that my children might be well versed 
in physical science, but in due subordination to the fullness and freshness of their 
knowledge on moral subjects. This, however, I believe can not be; wherefore, rather 
than have it the principal thing in my son’s mind, I would gladly have him think that 
the sun went round the earth and that the stars were so many spangles set in the bright 
blue firmament, and that he were trained to fulfillhis duty to his Maker and his fellow- 
men. 
Moral training the highest duty.—Superintendent E. E. White, of ‘Cincinnati: The effi- 
ciency of the public school is primarily tested by its results in moral character, and hence 
its highest duty is effective moral training. ‘The aim of the school is not the training 
of the mind alone, but the training of the man ; the forming, ennobling, and enriching 
 
-P-A-G-E-695
    RELIGIOUS AND MORAL TRAINING. i628 
of manhood. Manhood is the highest and best product of the school. In the public 
school, the school for the people and for the whole people, moral character must ever 
stand before intellectual culture. Asa means to this end, moral training mustrise above 
the mechanical virtues. It must tonch the conscience and make it regal i in the life; and 
to this end it must be permeated and yitalized, as is always has been in the ‘American 
school, by religious sanctions and influence. 
Will perish through its own momentum.—Superintendent Henry Sabin, of Iowa: Our 
American education, if it is to retain the confidence of the people, must be wholly on 
the side of that morality which has truth for its basis; it must stand for law and order 
and decency; its instructors must first know and then practice and then teach those eternal, 
immutable principles of right and wrong which are the foundations of a.permanent repub- 
lican liberty, The public school system is strong in proportion as it has the confidence 
of the people. When it comes to be regarded only as a machine for teaching enough of 
certain branches to enable a man to pass muster in the business world; when it does not” 
claim to have any hold beyond material and transient things; when it fails to include in 
its lessons the binding force of conscience and responsibility, it will perish through its 
own unguided momentum. 
The moral power of the public schools.—William A. Mowry in ‘‘Education:’’ There, 
are many close observers who believe that the moral power of our public schools in this 
country to-day is greater and more important for the welfare of the country than any 
other moral force now being exerted upon the people. The schools reach nearly all the 
children in the land at the most impressionable period of life. Even the churches and 
the Sunday schools reach but a small fraction of the people. 
The seeds that find a lodgment.—Zalmon Richards: In the name of all that is good we 
must protest against this growing neglect and almost total disregard of religious or moral 
instruction and qualifications on the part of our teachers. In some of our cities every- 
thing moral and religious—the Bible, prayer, and lessons in morals and manners—is 
stricken from the curriculum of school training. Is it any wonder that the seeds of 
anarchy, socialism, communism, infidelity, insubordination, and licentiousness so easily 
find a lodgment in the hearts of our youth thus neglected? ; 
Precept and preaching are minor factors.—C. B. Gilbert: It is to the intellectual that 
most of our efforts as teachers have thus far been directed, whereas the moral is of in- 
finitely greater importance to the man and State; and itis illogical, suicidal, for aState 
to educate the intellects of children and leave their morals untrained. But, fortunately 
for us, this can never occur. Morals are always trained for good or ill. Environment 
more than aught else determines their bent. 
Character is not built, it grows; and it grows through exercise usually unconscious. 
Consequently, for the training of the moral natures of the children in our schools, no 
new machinery is jReeded; no new course need be added to our already overcrowded 
curricula. * * 
Precept and ede doubtless have their place in moral economy, and yet they are 
at best only minor factors, acting very indirectly in the formation of character. The 
social and moral tone of a generation, the ideals held and incorporated into life by its 
average man, in short, its atmosphere, together with its blood, determines in the main 
the moral status of the next. 
If this be'true, the first requisite of a good school is a good tone, a wholesome moral 
atmosphere, a well-directed, well-lived life, so that the child continuously practices the 
virtues that he will need after he has le{tschool. If this requisite be met, we have that 
on which we may place a firmer reliance than on any course of ethics however profound, 
any verbal instruction however apt and able. 
Practice is what is needed.—J. W. MacDonald: A father once came to me with the 
complaint that his son, a boy in my school, would lie to him and deceive him, and asked 
me to takehimin hand. WhatI might have truly said to the man was this: ‘‘My dear, 
sir, why shouldn’t your boy lie and deceive? You lie and deceive; his mother lies and 
deceives; all his grandfathers and grandmothers as far back as they can be traced, lied 
and deceived; and do you expect me in a few months to eradicate all this depravity, 
both hereditary and acquired? Go home, sir, and set your boy a better example.’’ 
Well, I talked to the boy, and found him acquainted with all I could say to him about 
the wrong of lying. The problem, then, was not the same as if I had heen teaching 
_ him physics, for example. Then I would have had tointroduce him to new knowledge — 
as well as train his faculties; now, he had the knowledge, and practice was what was 
needed. 
Should enter into the daily class-work.—W. E. Sheldon: The schools must hereafter 
assign a larger place to instruction in morals. Lessons must be given calculated to make 
. z

the children and youth of our jand honest and upright, as well as active members of the 
pody politic. Tnstruction in character-building can not be given properly by the formal 
statement of a few inert formulas or solemn maxims, or even by special exhortations. 
Tt should blossom out, and its influence permeate all parts ‘of the work of the schools. 
Ethical instruction ought to be an important factor in all school-training. 1 should 
enter into the daily class-worls, into every variety of recitation, into the questions of 
management and discipline, and especially be illustrated by the character, example, and 
daily life of the teacher. 
Better than from text-books.—J. W. MacDonald, of Stoneham, Mass.: Morality can be 
tanght better than from text-books. Every study the child pursues furnishes a hundred 
and one opportunities to send home a moral shaft that will penetrate all the deeper be- 
cause it comes unexpected, and catches him off his guard. The teacher should take the 
utmost care that an absolutely untainted moral atmosphere invests theschool. Let the 
poy see that right and justice pervades all its management; let him be made to feel that 
the school and its regulations are a part of his country, and that disorder or disobedience 
istreason. * * * 
But the one thing greater than all others that the school can do for the cause of mo- 
rality is to place over their pupils teachers whose lives illustrate what they would have 
the pupils become. The silent influence of noble, manly goodness can not be overesti- 
mated, and makes text-hooks on morality a needless incumbrance. | 
Intellectual and moral growth must go hand in hand.—Cardinal Gibbons: The religious 
and the secular education of our children can not be divorced from each other without 
inflicting a fatal wound upon the soul. The usual consequence of such a separation is 
to paralyze the moral faculties and to foment a spirit of indifference in matters of faith. 
Education is to the soul what food is to the body. The milk with which the infant is 
_ nourished at its mother’s breast feeds not only its head, but permeates at the same time 
its heart and the other organs of its body. In like manner, the intellectual and moral » 
growth of our children must go hand in hand; otherwise their education is shallow and 
fragmentary, and often proves a curse instead of a blessing. a ae 
The catechetical instructions given once 4 week in our ‘Sunday schools, though pro- 
ductive of very beneficial results, are insufficient to supply the religious wants of our 
children. They should as far as possible breathe every day a healthy religious atmos- 
phere in those schools in which not only is their mind enlightened, but the seeds of faith, 
piety, and sound morality are nourished and invigorated. This would be effected if the 
denominational system, such as obtains in Canada, were applied in our public schools. 
The combination of religious ‘and secular education is easily accomplished in denomi- 
national schools. To what extent religion may be taught in the public schools without 
infringing the rights and wounding the conscience of some of the pupils is a grave prob- 
Jem beset with difficulties, and very hara to solve, jnasmuch as those schools are usually 
attended by children pelonging to the various Christian denominations, by Jews also, 
and even by those who profess no religion whatever. 
Your words will go no farther than your life carries them.—Samuel B, Capen in “Educa- 
tion: It is a good thought, of which we may all be frequently reminded, that if we 
swant to have the fullest respect of those eommitted to our care, it must come, not be- 
cause of any authority we may have in virtue of our office, but because of what we are. 
‘When you teach morals, of all things never forget that your words will gono farther than 
your own life carfies them. Back ‘of the teacher is the man, and what he is and not 
what he professes to be will always determine the force of his words. 
The surest way to keep children from evil.—James S. Barrell, in “Education: ’? Whether 
we shall give this (moral) training py formal lessons, or jncidentally, is with many a 
question. T would give it both ways. Tt seems to me that formal instruction tends 
more to completeness of character. Often, however, some jneident of school life fur- 
nishes a lesson whose influence in a particular direction could never be equaled by a 
formal lesson. *-* * 
There are few days which do not afford the opportunity for important and positive 
moral instruction. A remark upon a paragraph in reading, or upon % fact in history, 
may lift the whole class to a higher plane of thinking and acting. The surest way to 
keep children from evil is co fill their minds with that which is good and beautiful. 
Can this be done more effectually than by having them memorize choice passages of 
prose and poetry which express the very principles we would have appear in their lives? 
In Mr. John Fiske’s lecture upon Daniel Webster, he says that probably a majority 
of those who fought for the Union in the civil war had, as boys, Jearned and recited in 
school portions of Webster's reply to Hayne. For years T have believed that this speech 
was one of the most potent influences which caused the ‘uprising of a great people’” 
 
-P-A-G-E-697
  RELIGIOUS AND MORAL TRAINING. \ 625 
in the hour of the nation’s peril. Can not all the virtues be as effectually taught in 
this way as that of patriotism ? a 
It will meet no objection. —Supt. Geo. Barnes (Michigan): I have never heard anyone 
object to the teaching of morals in our public schools. We are crossing a bridge before 
wecome to it. If we teach the subject in its place and in its time it will meet no ob- 
jection. We should teach it as an art not.asa science. 
All teachers are giving moral training.—President L. R. Fiske, of Albion (Mich.) Col- 
ge: Every good school is a system of moral training from beginning to end. All 
eachers are giving moral training in our schools, I can not conceive of a school in 
which thisis not the case. No one should be atthe head of a school whois not a moral 
man or woman. 
More perilous.—State Supt. Edwin F. Palmer, of Vermont: If thought withont learn- 
ing is perilous, learning without sound morality is more perilous still. 
How to setile the whole question.—T. G, Apple, President of Franklin and Marshall 
College, Lancaster, Pa., in the New York Independent: Instead of talking abont it and 
debating the abstract question, let some one go to work and prepare a course of graded 
books on moral science, adapted to our schools, from the primary to the high school, 
and let them be introduced and taught, and the whole question on that point will be 
_ settled. There ought to be no doubt so faras the right of teaching morality in our 
public schools is concerned. It can be done without interfering with any one’s reli- 
gion. Letit be in accord with the spirit and principles of Christianity, and if anyone 
objects to this let him present a purer and better system, and it will be adopted. A 
system based on the principles of Christianity will be adopted, not because it comes with 
the external authority of this religion over that of any other, but because it authenti- 
cates itself as the purest and best. 
This question can be settled, we think, without raising the other question as to the 
right of teaching religion in our pablic schools, and it can be done, too, without divore- 
ing morality from religion, except as to the place in which each is to be taught.     
  Religious moonshine. —Rt. Rev. John J. Keane: Again and again, and almost continu- 
ously for the last twenty years, thinkers of every religion, and’of no religion, have la- 
mented that the inculcation of morality and religion in the public schools was not what 
it ought to be, The discussion now widely prevailing about the possibility and means 
of needed moral and religious training in them is sufficient acknowledgment of the lack 
hitherto existing. ‘‘ You must excuse me,’’ a Christian parent will logically say, ‘‘from 
considering their training just what I want for my child till the methods now urged shall 
have been tried and proved efficacious. And,’’ he would add, ‘‘that the result ever 
can be satisfactory, I am not prepared to believe. The whole of Christianity is needed 
as the basis, the mold, the restraint, the incentive of a Christian life. There is noth- 
ing in it superfluous, nothing that is not eminently practical in its bearings; and no min- 
imized, compromise Chiistianity can ever suffice in its stead. Such moral teachings as 
you might get from Cicero and Seneca never suffice for the moral teaching of Christ, 
and forthe motives, means, and sanctions of morality which Hebestows. All this vague, 
indefinite, noncommittal moralizing and religiousness is simply religious moonshine, 
which might be useful if we were in the darkness of religious night, but which it is ab- 
surd to wish to substitate for the Light of the World. No, I want His radiance clear 
and full in the schoolroom where my child spends his days.”’ 
Not Christianity enough in our publie schools.—Bishop John J. Keane, rector of the 
Catholic University, in the New York Independent: Now, to minds that reflect calmly 
and deeply nothing can be more evident than the need of making the system of popu- 
lar education more Christian, if our country is to be a Christian country, if our civili- 
zation is to be.a Christian civilization. That suchit is by right, and that such it must 
be maintained, no man who knows the history of civilization and the history of our 
country can hesitate to believe. And that it can be so maintained only by Christian edu- 
cation is so palpable a truth, so suggested by the very nature of things, that it is strange 
if it can be obscure to any intelligent mind. But the nature of education must very 
largely depend on the nature of the schools. This proposition, so clear initself, is made 
doubly so by assisting at such a meeting of educators as that which we have just wit- 
nessed at Nashville. There every utterance asserts, as a universally accepted fact, that 
the molding of the mind and heart and character of the child lies mostly with school 
and teacher; that parents recognize this fact, and are therefore anxious to have such 
schools and such teachers as shall best discharge this momentous responsibility in regard 
to their children. Hence, the conclusion is inevitable that the Christianity of educa- 
tion, and therefore of our civilization and country, must largely depend on the Chris- 
tianity of our schools; and that it would be ‘hardly reasonable to expect more Chris

tianity in the lives of our people than is to be found in the schools which have had so 
large and essential a share in molding them. ~ r 
But thoughtful people areevery where recognizing that there is not Christianity enough 
jn our public schools; that the tendency to the secularization of education—that is to the 
exclusion of religion from the schools—logically tends to the exclusion of religion from 
the public and private lives of our people; that it is a mistake and must be corrected, 
poth for love of religion and for love of country. Some,hopeless of modifying the tend- 
ency as long as the breeze of popular impulse and political interest blows in that direc- 
tion, have had to withdraw entirely from the public schools and build up a separate 
system of distinctively Christian schools, To suppose that they do this through any 
want of public spirit, through any want of interest in the public weal, through any 
want of devotedness to our country ‘and of solicitude for her welfare would be unreason- 
» able and unjust. Quite the contrary is the truth. Deeply convinced that our country’s 
welfare, as well as the religious welfare of each individual, depends on Christian educa- 
tion, they are acting not ly as reasonable and dutiful parents, but also as our coun- 
try’s truest friends, by fostering and maintaining, at cost of much tvil and expense, a 
system of education calculated to form a Christian people. 
Others, less logical or ess courageous and generous, or perhaps in the hope of yet 
reversing the present tendency and infusing more Christianity into the present system, 
cling to it, and doubtless with the natural wish to make the most of what one is com- 
mitted to, land it as the best and the only admissible system, In the same breath, 
“however, they give utterance to their anxiety about the gradual decay of clear and posi- 
tive Christian belief and Christian principles among our people, and about the need of 
remedying this by making our educational system more Christian. Thanks be to God 
for this widespreading anxiety! It gives hope of turning into safer paths. 
But how are they to accomplish this? Some hope to succeed by inculcating in the 
schools a system of Christian mozals, without definite dogmatic teaching; and not a few 
among them grow eloquent and poetical as they expatiate upon the moral influence of 
every natural fact, every scientific truth. But practical people smile; and observant 
people shake their heads; and serious people remember the warning of Washington, 
that our country must not hope for morality without religion—a term by which he 
meant something very different from the vague transcendentalism-of our poetical ‘mor- 
-alists. 
Others, perceiving the necessity of definite Christian teaching, hope to devise a system 
of it sufficiently vague and sufficiently elastic to suit the various denominational beliefs 
represented in the School constituencies. But how can the attempt be aught but a fail- 
ure? What Christian body will admit such a compromise as being the Christianity 
which Christ gave, and by which he meant that the world should be enlightened and 
guided? And who can hope that esteem for Christianity would be increased in the 
hearts of youth by a system aiming at minimizing Christianity as much as possible? 
The Bidle, religion, and morality in the public schools.—Austin Bierbower, of Chicago, 
Til,, in the New York Independent: It is not necessary to teach religion in the public 
schools, for the obvious reason that there are abundant other opportunities for such in- 
struction, The family, the church, and the Sunday school can teach all that is neces- 
sary to understand any religion. The doctrines of every church are few and simple; 
the evidences of Christianity are not many or difficult; the ceremonies and other reli- 
gious duties are easily acquired; so that all that is known as religion can be quickly 
Jearned. We have, moreover, an entire day reserved for such instruction, and special 
seasons besides for its emphasis. The appliances for training youth in religion are out 
of all proportion to the extent and difficulty of such training. Millions of dollars are 
annually spent, gorgeous churches are erected, and eloquent clergymen are employed 
for this end. As pastors, Sunday-school teachers, class leaders, and deacons, nearly all 
the adult population are engaged in imparting their views inreligion. Not onlySunday 
put every week day witnesses some meeting in nearly every church to promote religion, 
while countless benevolences furnish abundant exercise in practical religion. In no 
respeet are men so thoroughly organized and equipped as in religion; and in their yari- 
ous religious societies and assemblies the youth are participants and recipients of in- 
struction and discipline. 
This, I repeat, is enough to impart the slight amount of training of which men are 
capable in religion; and those who are taught in religious schools do not get any more 
or better religious training than this, nor are they known to be better men and women 
in any respect than those who are trained in this way. Every chureh has appljances to 
train adequately its 7 ung independently of the schools, and to train them in exactly 
the Icind of religion it wants taught; and no church admits that it is not competent for 
this task. Since, therefore, all the religious instruction needed can be given without 
encroaching on the weels-day schools, it isa bad polisy, as well as a piece of injustice, 
to insist on obtruding religion in the public schools as a pone of contention.    
-P-A-G-E-699
    RELIGIOUS AND MORAL TRAINING. Rast: OO 
The people, however, are not restricted to the church and to Sunday for religious 
training. Every family is’ a school and every parent a teacher; and in the family one 
can impart just such teaching as he wants learned. . The simplicity of religion—its 
doctrines and duties—makes it particularly easy for home impartation, and what little 
more is needed can easily be had of the pastor or church, or from religious literature. 
It requires but little guidance to furnish youth with surroundings that will give them 
all the instruction needed. The religious newspapers, books, songs, and pictures are of 
easy acquisition; so that the day school need not be called on to furnish anything in 
the interest of religion, I say, therefore, that religious training can be adequately 
_given, and is adequately given, without introducing it into the schools; although it is 
not a question for the schools or for citizens in their public capacity, whether it can be’ 
or not. Religion is a private concern, with which the State has properly nothing to do, 
and should rely on itself for its own success without taxing or restraining men in its — 
interest; but the fact that it can be fullyinculeated by private means removes all ground 
for insisting that it should be taught in the schools. y 
There is no occasion for even using the Bible in the schools. While it might be used 
without any influence whatever, good or bad, it can be read elsewhere abundantly, and’ 
is read in the family, in the Sunday-schools, and in churches almost daily, and is con- 
stantly discussed and quoted, so that the people are not left in ignorance of it. With an 
open Bible everywhere the Protestants ought not to insist on forcing it into the schools 
to the irritation of Catholics, Jews, and unbelievers, who have the same rights as Prot- 
estants in our public institutions. The fact that some regard it as a revelation from 
God does not justify them in forcing it on others who do notso regard it, or who believe 
it can not be safely read by the people. We do not neglect our duty when we fail to 
force it on others as their duty. ‘Protestants who think the Bible isnot sufficiently read 
can teach it more at home, and in the church, and through the press.’ The little that 
is perfunctorily read in school is not important, and might be dispensed with without 
perceptible loss to the scholars, especially since most of them are at an age whenit makes 
little impression, and since the same precepts are obtainable from other books or from 
the teacher. There is not enough to be gained from Bible reading to justify the quarrel 
that has been raised over it. 
While, therefore, it is not a question for the schools, or for the people in their public 
capacity, whether the Bible will be sufficiently read if not used in the schools, still, its 
influence will not be diminished by excluding it from the schools, so that its use may 
profitably be relegated to the people in their private or church capacity, where it be- 
longs. In communities where there is no opposition to its use there is no reason for 
thus excluding it any more than for excluding any other good book, and Catholics, 
Jews, and unbelievers can afford to let it be read and are injudicious in opposing it; 
but when they do oppose it others ought not to insist on having it. We are not the 
keepers of their judgment or their rights. 
For the same reason we can dispense, without loss to religion, with devotional exer- 
cises in the schools. People can pray at home and in the church and wherever they 
are, and can pray silently even in school. In no other country is there so much praying 
at the opening of schools and meetings as in America; and while it is unobjectionable 
where the parties interested make no complaint, it is not necessary. We do not do it at 
all gatherings. In opening a bank or railroad office or commencing work in a factory 
we have no devotions. It is a usage of arbitrary application and may be dropped from 
almost any assembly without a sacrifice of principle; and, when objection is raised ‘by 
interested parties it ought to be discontinued, especially as it may be continued every- 
where else. The’ ‘amount of good that is done by such devotion is apt to be overesti- 
mated, especially as most of the children come from their morning prayers to school 
and return to other devotions in the family or church. Parents who insist on shifting 
their praying onto the school often neglect it at home, and in charging a public institu- 
tion with their duties omit them themselves; so that in embarrassing the schools they. 
introduce neglect in the household. Devotion, like religion generally, will be better, 
maintained if it is made a private charge; and if parents had to teach their children 
more they would learn more themselves, Devotion will lose nothing by becoming less 
a matter of State regulation. 
But not only is it not to the interest of religion to teach religion in the public schools, 
but it is not to the interest of the other studies that religion be taught with them. Re- 
ligion is a distinct matter, and may be taught alone, and they are eachadistinct matter 
and may be taught alone. Especially is this so in teaching the elements, which are about . 
all that can be taught ofany subject in the publicschools. It does not benefit the study 
of arithmetic, spelling, reading, penmanship, grammar, geography, music, drawing, Latin, 
or any of the other branches, to teach religion in connection with it. All the studies of 
the public schools are as independent of religion as of horse-racing. Its introduction 
can not modify one conclusion in geometry, or combination in chemistry; so that there

is no more reason for associating school work with religion than for associating cooking 
with baseball; and there is no sense whatever in calling that. institution ‘*godless ’? 
which teaches such branches without religion. One might as well call insurance com- 
panies or banks ‘‘godless’’ because they have nothing’ to do with religion, or speak of 
_ godless kite-flying or musical festivals. 
‘The only subject'on which there is any apparent difficulty is morals; and in this the 
difficulty is only apparent, and results {rom confusion. Religion and morals are often 
confounded, as if they were the same, and as if the exclusion of one implied the exclu- 
sion of the other. The charge is commonly made that if the schools do not teach re- 
ligion the scholars will grow up without moral training. 
For there is no serious difference of opinion about right and wrong requiring any dif- 
ferent instruction accordiag to men’s differences about religion. All men, no matter 
what their religion, or whether they have any religion, recognize the same virtues— 
truth, honesty, ‘purity, Tove, politeness, etc. There is a greater unanimity on this sub- 
ject than on almost any other. The few exceptions are trifling and of no practical con- 
cern, and of them I shall speak hereafter. At present I say that roorality, on which 
mankind are essentially agreed, can ve taught without religion, and should be so taught 
in the schools. The very fact that all men approve the same morality makes it obvious 
that no religion is necessary to teach it. If the Jew, the Catholic, the Protestant, and 
the unbeliever all accept the same virtues, it is clear that the religion of none of them 
is necessary for the inculeation of such virtues, and the inculcation of such virtues does 
not imply any damage to any of the religious, There must be some other and more 
common ground and motive to morality; so that morality can be taught without relig- 
jon, and the exclusion of religion from the schools does not imply in the least degree 
the exclusion-of moral instruction. That which all believe alike can be taught with- 
out offense to any. * ij 
It is sometimes claimed that the ultimate foundation of morality is inreligion—the will 
of God, for example—and that unless this be taught we can not adequately teach mo- 
rality. This, however, is a matter of speculative philosophy, like all other alleged 
grounds of morality, and does not affect practical ethics any more than one’s theory of 
the origin of man affeets his choice of a tailor or cook. Whether the ‘‘ will of God,”’ 
the ‘‘order of Nature,”’ ‘‘revelation,’’ ‘‘utility,’’ or ‘‘ happiness’? be the ground of 
morality is a question of metaphysics and not of morals, and should be referred to that 
science. No matter what view is taken of the metaphysical ground of right, all theo- 
ries end in adopting the same practical virtues, which; as I have already indicated, are 
approved by all men; so that our speculative differences do not seriously affect our 
morals, and need not be taken into account in public training. 
Religious instruction must be left to parents; moral instruction is inseparable from the 
school.—A. P. Marble, superintendent ‘of Worcester (Mass. ), schools, in the New York 
Independent: The state has nothing to do with another world. Religion has respect 
toa future existence. Distinctively religious instruction, then, must be left to parents 
and to the Sunday schools which they may select. It has been demonstrated by ex- 
perience that no political body can foster religion. Religion is a matter of the heart; 
it must be voluntary and spontantous; it is spiritual. It thrives best by its own agen- 
cies, distinct from the state. 
» But moral instruction is inseparable from any good school. There is morality in the 
teaching of arithmetic and in every science. The pursuit of truth in any of its forms 
has a moral influence. The example of a good man is a moral power, and every teacher 
ought to be good; and as a rule they are good. No class of society, not even clergymen 
ot any persuasion or all persuasions, will average better morally than teachers. And if 
any one shall say that this moral instruction, such as isimparted by every warm-hearted, 
earnest teacher, filled with an overflowing love for children, embraces the most valuable 
part of religion, many people will agree with him. 
The Bible should be read daily in every school; and the selections should be adapted 
to the age and capacity of the children: First, because this book is the basis of* the’ 
morality of this country; and, secondly, because it has so influenced our civilization, 
and it so permeates our literature, that ignorance of it is more noticeable and less excus- 
able than no acquaintance with Shakespeare. 
But this reading should not be forced upon anyone, much less should any perfunc- 
tory prayer or sectarian hymn find a place in any public school. But a devout spirit 
should pervade the school, and there are universal psalms by our greatpoets which all 
might willingly sing. 
In Canada.—Prof. Goldwin Smith, of Toronto, in the New York Independent: It does 
not appear to me that children are less instructed in religion here, though the duty is 
left to the parent and the Sunday school, than they were in England at the time when 
all the schools were connected with churches. As to morality—the be-t school is the 
most moral, and, with us, the separate schools are allowed not to be the best,

RELIGIOUS AND MORAL TRAINING. 629 
We must multiply and perfect Christian schools.—Rt, Rev. John J. Keane: We must cling 
to this sacred cause, and uphold it atany cost. We must carry aloft before the eyes of our 
country the banner of Christian education. We must multiply and perfect Christian 
schools, till all our children and all our youth can have in the fullest abundance all the 
blessed intellectualand moral advantages which are the essential condition of Christian 
civilization. We must stop at no difficulties; we must count no cost. Atany cost the work 
must and shall go on, for we areall called toit both by a love of God and love of country. 
Our country may for a while misunderstandand misjudge us: she may treat us unfairly; 
she may tax us doubly, may suspect our motives. But, like the Grecian hero of old, 
we will look her lovingly in the faceand say, ‘‘Strike, but hear me!’’ And we will per- 
severe, until the good sease and the noble heart of the American people give the victory 
at last where it is rightly due, and all ranksof our fellow-citizens who believe in Chris- 
tian civilization will join with usin securing it by Christian education—will vie in 
guiding all the youth of the land in the gladsome ways of Him who alone is or can be 
the Light of the World. 
Ts the Bible a sectarian book ?—State Superintendent J. B. Thayer, of Wisconsin, has 
issued a pamphlet giving in full the opinions of the judges of the supreme court of that 
State in the case of the State of Wisconsin ew rel. Frederick Weiss ¢¢ als. vs. District 
Board No. 8, of the city of Edgerton. This and the two following extracts are taken from 
that publication. 
Justice W. P. Lyon, in delivering the decision of the court: We come now to the 
more direct consideration of the merits of the controversy. The term ‘‘sectarian in- 
struction’’ in the constitution manifestly refers exclusively to instruction in religious 
doctrines, and the prohibition isonly aimed at such instruction as is sectarian. Thatis 
to say, instruction in religious doctrines which are believed by some religious sects and 
rejected by others. Hence, to teach the existence of a supreme being, of infinite wis- 
dom, power, and goodness, and that it is the highest duty.of all men to adore, obey,and 
love him, is not sectarian, because all religious sects so believe and teach. The instruc- 
tion becomes sectarian when it goes further, and inculcates doctrine or dogma concern- 
ing which the religious sects are in conflict. This we understand to be the meaning of 
the constitutional prohibition. 
That the reading from the Bible in the schools, although unaccompanied by any com- 
ment on the part of the teacher, is ‘instruction’? seems to us too clear for argument. 
Some of the most valuable instruction a person ean receive may be derived from read- 
ing alone, without any extrinsic aid by way of comment or exposition. The question, 
therefore, seems to narrow down to this: Is the reading of the Bible in the schools— 
not merely selected passages therefrom, but the whole of it—sectarian instruction of 
the pupils? In view of the fact already mentioned, that the Bible contains numerous 
doctrinal passages, upon some of which the peculiar creed of almost every religious 
sect is based, and that such passages may reasonably be understood to inculeate the doc- 
trines predicated upon them, an affirmative answer tothe question seems unavoidable. 
Any pupil of ordinary intelligence who listens to the reading of the doctrinal portion 
of the Bible will be more or less instructed thereby in the doctrines of the divinity of 
Jesus Christ, the eternal punishment of the wicked, the authority of the priesthood, 
the binding force and efficacy of the sacraments, and many other conflicting sectarian 
doctrines. 
A most forcible demonstration of the accuracy of this statement is found in certain 
reports of the American Bible Society of its work in Catholic countries (referred to in 
one of the arguments), in which instances are given of the conversion of several persons 
from ‘‘ Romanism’’ through the reading of the Scriptures alone. That is to say, the 
reading of the Protestant or King James version of the Bible converted Catholics to Prot- 
estants without the aid of comment or exposition. In those cases the reading of the 
Bible certainly was sectarian instruction. We do not know how to frame an argument 
in support of the proposition that the reading thereof in the district schools is not also 
sectarian instruction. 
It should be observed in this connection that the above views do not, as counsel 
seemed to think they may, banish from the district schools such text-books as are 
founded upon the fundamental teaching of the Bible, or which contain extracts there- 
from. Such teachings and extracts pervade and ornament our secular literature, and are 
important elements in its value and usefulness. Such text-books are in the schools for 
secular instruction, and rightly so, and the constitutional prohibition of sectarian in- 
struction does not include them, even though they may contain passages from which 
some inferences of sectarian doctrine might possibly: be drawn. 
Furthermore, there is much in the Bible which can not justly be characterized as sec- 
tarian. There can be no valid objection to the use of such matter in the secular in- 
struction of the pupils. Much of it has great historical and literary value which may 
be thus utilized without violating the constitutional prohibition. It may also be used

to Sealoate good oem is, our duties to each other—which may and ought to be 
ineulcated by the district schools. No more complete code of morals exists than is con- 
tained in the New Testament, which reaffirms and emphasizes the moral obligations laid 
down in the Ten Commandments. Concerning the fundamental principles of moral 
ethics, the religious sects do not disagree. * e 
It is argued that the reading of the ‘Bible in the district schools is not included in the 
constitutional prohibition of sectarian instruction therein, because the Bible is not spe- 
Cifically mentioned in the constitution. It is said that if it was intended that such 
reading was to be excluded, it would have been so provided in direct terms. The argu- 
» ment may be plausible, but it is believed to be unsound. Constitutions deal with gen- 
eral principles and polici ies, and do not usually descend to a specification of particulars. 
Such is the character of the provision in question. In general terms, it excludes sec- 
tarian instruction, and the exclusion includes all forms of such instruction. Its force 
would or might iiave been weakened had the attempt been made a specify therein all 
the methods | “by which such instruction may be imparted. * * 
For the reasons above stated, we can not doubt that the use of the Bible as a text-book 
in the public schools, and the ‘stated reading thereof in such schools, without restric- 
tion, ‘has a tendency to inculcate sectarian 1 ideas”? and is sectarian instruction, within 
the meaning and intention of the constitution and the statute. 
Does reading the Bible in a public school render the schoolhouse a place of worship ?—Jus- 
tice J. B. Cassoday, in the same case as the preceding: The second clause of the section 
[of the constitution of Wisconsin] quoted is. to the effect that no man shall ‘‘ bercom- 
pelled to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry 
against his consent.’? ‘Ts the stated reading of the Bible in the public schools as a text- 
book ‘‘ worship”? within the meaning of this clause? As indicated in the clauses al- 
ready considered, the word ‘‘ worship,’’ as here used, includes any and every mode of 
worshiping Abpighty God. * * * Certainly the reading of the Holy Scriptures as 
the eternal word of God, in obedience to the often repeated injunction therein contained, 
whether by the individual in private or in the family, or in the public assembly, is an 
essential part of divine worship. Every sermon is based upon some text of scripture. 
Most prayers are preceded by the reading of some passage of scripture, as an intelligent 
guide to the thoughts of the worshiper or worshipers. The Sermon on the Mount con- 
tains the prayer taught by the blessed Lord. Is it possible for any genuine believer in 
the Christian religion to read or listen to the reading of that sermon, and especially that 
prayer, without being filled with a holy sense of honor, reverence, adoration, and homage 
to Almighty God, which is the very essence of worship, We must hold that the stated 
reading of the Bible in the public schools as a text-book may be ‘‘ worship’? within the 
meaning of the clause of the constitution under consideration. If, then, such reading 
of the Bible is worship, can there be any doubt but what the schoolroom in which it is 
so statedly read is a ‘place of worship,’’ within the meaning of the same clause of the 
constitution? Counsel seem to argue that such place of worship should be confined to 
some church edifice, or place where the members of a church statedly worship. Some 
of the earlier constitutions having similar clauses used the words ‘‘building’? and 
“‘church.’? Manifestly the words ‘‘ place of worship’? were advisedly used as applicable 
to any ‘‘place’’ or structure where worship is statedly held, and which the citizen is 
““compelled to attend,’’ or the taxpayers are compelled ‘‘to erect or support.’? Tho 
mere fact that only a small fraction of the school hours is devoted to such worship in no 
way justifies such usé as against an objecting taxpayer. If the right be conceded, then 
the length of time so devoted becomes a matter of discretion. If such right does not 
exist, then any length of time, however short, is forbidden. The relators, as taxpayers 
of the district, were compelled to aid in the erection of the school building in question, 
and also to aid in the support of the school maintained therein. Being thus compelled 
to aid i in sueh erection and support, they have a legal right to object to its being used 
as a ‘‘place of worship.” 
The province of the common school as regards religious instruction under the constitution of 
Wisconsin.—Statement of Justice H. S, Orton, in the same case as the preceding: The 
‘common schools are free to all alike, to all nationalities, to all sects of religion, to all 
ranks of society, and to all complexions, For these equal privileges and rights of in- 
struction in them all are taxed equally and proportionately. The constitutional name, 
‘common schools,”’ expresses their equality and universal patronage and support. Com- 
mon schools are not common, as being low in character or grade, but common toallalike, 
to everybody and to all seets or denominations of religion, but without bringing religion 
into them. The common schools, like all the other institutions of the State, are pro- 
tected by the constitution from all ‘‘ control orinterference with therights of conscience,” 
and from all preferences given by law to any religious establishments or modes of wor- 
ship, As the State can have nothing to do with religion, except to protect every one in

      cs “RELIGIOUS AND MORAL TRAINING. pan 
the enjoyment of his own, so the common schools can have nothing to do with religion 
in any respect whatever. They are as completely secular as any of the other institutions 
of the State, in which all the people, alike, have equal rights and privileges. The peo- 
ple can not be taxed for religion in schools, more than anywhere else. Religious instruc- 
tion in the common schools is as clearly prohibited by these general clauses of the consti- 
tution as reliyious instruction or worship in any other department of state supported 
by the revenue derived from taxation. The clause, that ‘‘no sectarian instruction shall 
be allowed therein,’’ was inserted ew industria to exclude everything pertaining to reli- 
gion. They are called by those who wish to have not only religion, but their own reli- 
gion, taught therein, ‘‘Godless schools.’? They are Godless, and the educational: de-, 
partment of the Government is Godless, in the same sense that the executive, legislative, 
and administrative department are Godless. So long as our constitution remains as it 
is, no one’s religion can be taught in our common schools. By religion, I mean reli- 
gion as a system, not religion in the sense of natural law. Religion in the latter ° 
sense is the source of all law and government, justice and truth, Religion asa sys- 
tem of belief can not be taught without offense to those who have their own peculiar 
views of religion, no more than it can be without offense to the different sects of reli- 
gion. How canreligion, in this sense, be taught in the common schools, without taxing 
the people for or on account of it. The only object, purpose, or use for taxation by law 
in this State must be exclusively secular. . There is no such source and cause of strife, 
quarrel, fights, malignant opposition, persecution and war, and all evil in the State, as 
religion. Let it once enter into our civil affairs, our government would soon be de- 
stroyed. Let it once enter into our common schools, they would be destroyed. Those 
who made our constitution saw this, and used the most aptand comprehensive language 
in it to prevent such a catastrophe. It is said, if reading the Protestant version of the 
Bible in school is offensive to the parents of some of the scholars and antagonistic to 
their own religious views, their children can retire. They ought not to be compelled to 
go out of the school for such a reason for one moment. ‘The suggestion itself concedes 
the whole argument. That version of the Bible is hostile to the belief of many who are 
taxed to support the common schools, and who have equal rights and privileges in them. 
It is a source of religious and sectarian strife. That is enough. It violates the letter 
and spirit of the constitution. No State constitution ever existed, that so completely 
excludes and precludes the possibility of religious strife in the civil affairs of the State, 
and yet so fully protects all alike in the enjoyment of their own religion, , Allsects and 
denominations may teach the people their own doctrines in all proper places. Ourcon- 
stitution protects all and favors none. But they must keep out of the common schools 
and civil-affairs, It requires but little argument to prove that the Protestant version 
of the Bible, or any other version of the Bible, is the source of religious strife and oppo- 
sition, and opposed to the religious belief of many of our people. It is a sectarian book, 
‘The Protestants were a very small sect in religion at one time, and they are a sect yet 
. to the great Catholic Church against whose usages they protested, and so is their version 
of the Bible sectarian as against the Catholic version of it, The common school is one 
of the most indispensable, useful, and valuable civil institutions this State has, It is . 
democratic and free to all alike, in perfect equality, where all the children of our peo- 
ple stand on a common platform, and may enjoy the benefits of an equal and common 
education. An'enemy to our common schools is an enemy to our Stategovernment. It 
is the same hostility that would cause any religious denomination that had acquired 
the ascendancy over all others to remodel our constitution, and change our government 
and all of itsinstitutions, so as te make them favorable only to itself, and exclude all others 
from their benefits and protection. In such an event, religious and sectarian instruc- 
tion will be given in all schools. Religion needs no support from the State, It is 
stronger and much purer without it. * * * Morality and good conduct may be in- 
culcated in the common schools, andshould be. The connection of church and State 
corrupts religion and makes the State despotic, 
The Bible a seetarian book.—New York Independent: The supreme court of Wisconsin, 
in the case of Weiss against the district school board of education, has recently rendered’ 
a very important decision in relation to the reading of the Bible in the public schools. 
of that State. The Catholics objected in the case to the reading of King James’s Version 
of the Bible in the public school of the district; and the circuit court for Rock County 
overruled the objection and sustained such reading of the Bible as constitutional and 
proper. The case was then carried to the supreme court of the State, and that court 
has just decided that the reading of the Bible in the public schools ot Wisconsin is not 
consistent with the constitution of thatState. This settles the school question and the 
Bible for the whole State. The ground taken by the court is that the reading of King’ 
James’s Version of the Bible in the public schools, whether as a means of instruction 
or as act of worship, is, as it respects Catholics who do not accept this version as cor- 
rect, to introduce a sectarian book into these schools, as really as if the Douay Ver- 
    
-P-A-G-E-704

sion of the Bible, which the Catholics do accept, were thus used. This is the pith 
o! the principle laid down in this decision; and we think it to be entirely correct, and, 
as a principle, just as applicable in this State as it is in Wisconsin. The simple truth 
is that our public school system, sustained by general taxation, and regulated by State 
authority, should confine itself exclusively to the secular sphere of instruction, and leave 
all questions relating to religious instruction and religions worship absolutely untouched. > 
‘There is no other ground that is consistent with our political system or with equity as 
between different religious sects. Protestants make a grave mistake in dealing with 
this question when they claim for themselves what they deny to Catholics. Let the 
State have a public school system for secular purposes, and stop there. Let religicus 
instruction be otherwise provided for. 
Why the Lutherans established parochial schools, —Extract from a discourse reprinted by 
the German Lutheran committee of the Synod of Missouri and other States: We Luth- 
erans are not bent upon opposing our public schools, We are aware that for many rea- 
sons our civil authorities are obliged to erect and maintain schools, and we are glad to 
see them take an interest in the education of our country’s children, soas to make them 
intelligent citizens. We know that a large number of our country’s children would be 
left without any instruction whatever by their parents if our State authorities did not 
look to their education. For this reason we cheerfully and wiliingly pay our taxes for 
public institutions of learning. It is our desire that not a cent of these taxes be ex- 
pended for sectarian purposes, but that every cent be used in the interest of the public 
and community at large. We seek to discourage all attempts that are being made to 
appropriate money from the public-school fund for private and denominational schools. 
Hence I feel justified in claiming that it is not opposition to our public schools that in- 
duces us to build and maintain church schools... Well, what is it? you ask. 
Our parochial schools are institutions of learning where the attending pupils receive 
an education in reading, writing, arithmetic, geography, history, and grammar; but in 
connection with these secular branches of knowledge they are daily instructed in the 
-histories and doctrines of the Bible, so that on their dismissal from school they are thor- 
oughly acquainted with the law and commandments of their God and the way unto sal- 
vation. And if I were asked to give a brief reply to the question, why we Lutherans 
erect and maintain such schools, I should answer, because we know it to be our sacred 
duty to give our children a thorough Christian education; and we are convinced that 
under present circumstances this duty may best be performed by means of congrega- 
tional schools. * * * 
We know it to be imposed on us by God Almighty himself to afford them a thorough 
Christian education. That is the reason why we feel ourselves bound to establish schools, 
where religious instruction is a chief part of the daily studies. ‘True, we desire our chil- 
dren to be fit for the duties and pursuits of this life; but it is of greater importance to us 
that they be fit to walk in the narrow path which leads them to the life to come. We in- 
deed want our children to study the histories and events of this world; but we would see « 
them acquainted with the great histories and truths of the Bible, informing them of 
their creation, their lamentable fall, and their glorious redemption through Christ Jesus. 
We indeed do not intend our children should neglect the study of arithmetic, geography, 
and grammar, but we consider it a paramount obligation towards them to have them 
calculate the length and breadth, the depth and height of God’s love, to have them look 
for the mountain whence cometh their help, to have’ them know in what direction Je- 
rusalem, the golden city with its dazzling gates of pearl, is situated, and to have them 
speak in the language and grammar of sincere children of God. Tn short, my friends, 
we realize the imperative duty of giving our children a thorough instruction in the great 
truths and undefiled doctrines of Christianity pertaining to the salvation of their im- 
mortal souls, and that is the reason why wre I Lutherans make it a practice to educate our 
children in congregational schools. * * 
From what has been said I trust that you one and all are ready to admit the duty of 
parents to bestow on their children a religions education and training, but you perhaps 
have your doubts as to the necessity and practicability of performing this duty by means 
of congregational schools. Well, what method have you of discharging this duty? I 
need not call your attention to the fact that our public schools furnish no religious in- 
struction whatever; you are aware of that. And I for my part am persuaded that in 
this country, where we have such diversity of religious faith and opinion, it would be 
utterly impracticable and unadvisable to introduce religion into the schools of our State. 
Besides, our civil government is under no obligation at all to see the Christian training 
of its subjects. It may require them to be loyal and intelligent citizens, but no more. 
The Constitution of our country provides for the complete separation of religious and 
civil affairs, of church and state. The foundeis of our Republic evinced great wisdom 
when they ‘adopted this important statute. ‘That is as it ought to be in every country.

    ’ 
RELIGIOUS AND MORAL TRAINING. ° 633 
And as long as our Constitution continues to make this provision we shall ever be ready 
to stand by it and defend it. Now, with all candor of spirit, I put the question to you: 
Do our children receive a thorough religious training within our family circles? I ven- 
ture the statement that if the Christian education of our children were entirely left to 
the family the children of ninety-nine families out of one hundred would receive but a 
very meager and scanty religious instruction. A large number of parents to-day are so 
busily engaged in the affairs of this life that they find little or no time fora proper edu- 
cation of their children within the family. We see fathers leaving their homes early 
in the morning for their places of business and returning late in the evening tired and 
weary. Mothers are generally engaged from morning till night in doing their house- 
work and arranging the affairs of their homes. Where is the time and room, tell me, 
for a thorough Christian education of children within the circles in families? And how 
often do we meet with parents who are incapable of teaching their children at home 
even if they desired to. Nay, my friends, you undoubtedly are right in claiming the 
family to be a proper place for the religious training of children, but at the same time 
you are forced to concede that in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred the families can 
not and do not grant their children a thorough and lasting instruction in religion. And | 
that is the reason why we Lutherans deem it by far the best method to establish Christian 
schools for the discharge of a duty for which our parents have no sufficient time at home. 
But it almost seems to me that I hear some one remark, you are entirely overlooking 
our Sunday schools; do not they afford our children a Christian education? You will 
allow me to say a few wordsin regard to the prevailing Sunday-school system. We have 
no inclination to detract from the merits of Sunday schools if they are properly conducted. . 
But common sense and experience tell that the Christian education which children de- 
rive by means of our Sunday schools must needs be very superficial. Think of the little 
time that Sunday schools allow for religious instruction, an hour a week, 1 out of 168. 
If I hada boy whom I intended to be a physician and become skilled in the art of sur- 
gery so that he would be capable of performing the most difficult surgical opera- 
tions, and I made it a practice to send him an hour a week to some medical college, you 
would be right in considering that the greatest folly. We can not be satisfied with 
having our children instructed an hour a week in matters that pertain to the eternal 
salvation of their immortal souls. We are convinced, and this conviction of ours is 
based upon experience, that if our children are to receive a thorough knowledge and 
lasting impression of the Bible, its divine truths and commandments, they are in need 
of daily religious instruction. The law of God will have to be called to their minds, 
explained to them, and brought home to their hearts by competent teachers day after 
day. And that is what we are aiming at in our parochial schools. _ In all discipline ex- 
ercised in our schools we strive to make the word of God the governing element. And 
even the secular sciences taught in our schools are pervaded by aChristianspirit. That 
is what we, under present circumstances, deem the best, if not the only correct method 
of bringing up our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; and that isthe 
* reason why we Lutherans make it a practice to establish, build, and maintain parochial 
schools. 
A Presbyterian declaration,—Resolution unanimously adopted by the Presbyterian 
General Assembly at Syracuse, May 26, 1890: Resolved, That we afiirm the importance 
of our public schools to the welfare of our people; that with intellectual cultivation 
must go moral training, or the schools may prove a curse rather than a blessing, but 
this moral training must be based on religion, otherwise its sanction will not be strong 
enough to grasp the conscience of the peopleor its utterances obligatory enough to shape 
their character; that, as the Bible is the source of the highest moral teaching, we regard 
its exclusion from our public schools as a menace to national welfare, and we urge the 
members of our Church toso arouse public thought on this subject, from the pulpit, the 
press, and the ecclesiastical assemblages, that this book shall be restored to its true place 
in our system of education. 
A compromise proposed.—Dr. W. T. Harris: There isa practical aspect to this question. 
So long as Protestants insist on some remnant of the church ceremonial, 'such as the 
reading of the Scriptures or prayers, the Catholic may be expected to see in the public 
school an instrument for proselyting his children. On the other hand, the schools may 
be made purely secular and the Catholic may still object on the ground that he wishes 
religious instruction united with secular instruction. I think that most of the Catholic 
laity have settled this question in favor of the purely secular school. If the secular 
school prevented churches and church schools—in short, prevented religious instruction 
altogether—the secularschool might be condemned without the possibility of defending 
it; but the Catholic sees that he may have religious instruction in his church or ina 
church school apart from secular instruction. Now, in a community where the people 
desire to bring together all children in the public schools without prejudicing in any
-P-A-G-E-706
  
  t ¥ pet: a Cee 
634 _ EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
way the rights of any religious denominations, I think that the matter can be easily 
settled. There will be a spirit of compromise; not of compromise in regard to the secu- 
larity of the school, but with regard to the feelings and prejudices of the community. 
For instance, the Catholic children may be permitted to be absent from school one or 
two hours a week tu attend religious instruction in the parish church. Such a conces- 
sion as this is a compromise and a recognition of the convictions of that portion of the 
community. Such a recognition implies a tolerant regard for the right ot private opin- 
ion.’ I believe that the Catholic ecclesiastical power desires a formal recognition of this 
kind much more than it desires any substantial concession, such, for instance, as would 
lead to the introduction of Catholic religious instruction within the school building be- 
fore or after school—a compromise that has been often discussed. Inacommunity that 
is largely Protestant the Catholic wishes to have his religion treated with respect. Such 
formal concession carried out in good faith is all that is required, itseemsto me. Mean- 
while the concession made in Savannah, Poughkeepsie, and a few other places, viz, a 
compromise which permits Catholic religious exercises before or after school in the 
schoolroom, or which permits the teacher to wear the garb of some Catholic order—the 
garb of the sisters or of the priesthood—militates against the public character of the 
school, and can not be conceded as a possible compromise. 
Two ways of rendering religious instruction feasible in public schools.—Archbishop Ire- 
land, at the National Educational Association: I would permeate the regular State school 
with the religion of the majority of the children of the land, be it as Protestant as Prot- 
estantism can be, and I would, as they do in England, pay for the secular instruction 
“given in denominational schools according to results. ‘That is, each pupil passing the 
examination before State officials, and in full accordance with theState programme, would 
secure to his school the cost of the tuition of a pupil in the State school, This is not 
paying for religious instruction given to the pupil, but for secular instruction demanded 
by the State, and given to the pupil as thoroughly as he could have received in the State 
school. 
The archbishop’s other proposition is this: ; 
I would do as Protestants and Catholics in Poughkeepsie, and other places in our 
_ country, have agreed to do, to the great satisfaction of all citizens and the great advance- 
- ment of educational interests. In Poughkeepsie the city school board rents the build- 
ings formerly used as parish schools; and from the hour of 9 a. m. to that of 3 p, m. 
the school is in every particular a State school—teachers engaged and paid by the board, 
teachers and pupils examined, State books used, the door always open to superintend- 
ent.and members of the board. There is simply the tacit understanding that so long 
as the teachers in those schools, Catholic in faith, pass their examinations and do their 
work as cleverly and loyally as other teachers under the control of the board, teachers 
of another faith shall not be put in their place. Nor are they allowed to teach positive 
religion during school hours. This is done outside the hours for which the buildings 
are leased to the board. The State, it is plain, pays not one cent for the religious in- 
struction of the pupils. In the other schools let Protestant, devotional exercises take 
place, in the fullest freedom, before the usual school hour. — x 
XI.—Revenve anp TAXATION. 
An increase of school revenues needed.—State Superintendent J. W. Patterson, of New 
Hampshire: The State can not afford to be parsimonious in providing for the education 
of its people. It will have the same effect upon its intellectual and moral life as the 
drying up of its rivers would have upon its industries and wealth. The applications of 
science and mechanical inventions to the industries of life, the rivalries of business, the 
materialistic tendencies of the age, the necessity for the social advancement, all call for 
"an increase rather than a decrease of school revenues. 
To equalize district taxes.—State Superintendent Edwin F. Palmer, of Vermont: It is 
difficult to see how any reason can be given for the support of highways, bridges, and 
the poor by a tax on all the property of the town that is not of equal force in favor of 
supporting the schools in the same way. 
Why paroehial schools should have a due proportion of the public-school funds.—Rev. M, 
M. Sheedy: 
1, Because all who pay taxes ought to share in the benefits of taxation. 
7 2. Because to compel payment of taxes and to exclude from participation is political 
_ injustice, 
3. Because to offer education, either without Christianity or with indefinite Chris- 
tianity, to the people of the United States, of whom the great majority are definitely 
and conscientiously Christian, is a condition that ought to be of impossible acceptance. 
4, Because to confer the exclusive contfol and enjoyment of the school funds om the 
   
-P-A-G-E-707
    SCHOOL HYGIENE. 635 
public schools alone is to create a grievance of conscience which is especially foreign to 
our constitutional system. A large class of our people—the Catholics—who conscien- 
tiously refuse to accept education without Christianity and schools of indefinite Chris- 
tianity, are compelled to pay taxes for the support of such schools. 
5. Because the parochial schools save annually the public revenues $10,000,000. 
. 6. Because, if the parochial schools were extinguished, it would cost the people of the 
United States a vast sum of money to buy sites and build theschools necessary to replace 
them, and an annual increase in the school tax necessary to maintain them. 
7. Because the parochial schools are the only safeguard of the rights and conscience, 
both of parents and children. | 
8. Because they embody the freedom of the people to educate themselves in opposi- 
tion to the pagan and revolutionary claim that the sole educator of the people is the 
State. 
9. Because such education is the worst form of education, fatal to the independence 
of national consciénce, energy, and character. 
10. Because the effects of a purely secular or State education have proved disastrous 
wherever it has had a trial. 
11. Because no reason is apparent for excluding parochial schools from a share of the 
school taxes but that they are Christian. ° 
12. Because the efficiency of the parochial-school system is fully equal to that of the 
public schools. ; 
13. Because parochial schools.sell good and efficient secular education to the State, 
for which they receive not a dollar of payment.   
Taxes levied irrespective of benefits.—In regard to the assertion that ‘‘all who pay taxes 
ought to share in the benefits of taxation,’’ the Journal of Education says: This isin no 
sense an American axiom or principle. It has nothing whatever to do with the policy 
of American life. We do not tax a man, but his property. We do not tax the prop- 
erty in proportion to the share of benefit the owner is to receive. A man’s property © 
may be taxed so that thousands of dollars shall be used in highways, though he. may 
never be able to ride upon them or see them, and may have no family to enjoy them; 
thousands may be used. for schools, though he was never in a public school a day and 
may have no child to attend; thousands may go to county buildings, State buildings, 
etc. When a man’s property is taxed there is no contract, direct of indirect, made or 
implied, that he is personally to’ be considered in its use. 
The State must take further measures.—State Commissioner Thomas B. Stockwell, of 
Rhode Island: The average local tax for school purposes, that is, the support of public 
schools throughout the State, is 16} cents on each $100 of taxable property. While 
this is the figure for the State, we find that by counties it varies from 9} cents in Wash-, 
ington County to 18} cents in Providence County. But the variations among the towns 
are much more startling, being from 3} cents in the new district of Narragansett up to 
39} cents in West Greenwich. , Next above Narragansett comes Jamestown with a tax 
of 5 cents, then there are some eight or nine towns whose taxes vary from 8 to 10 cents, 
As a rule the poorer towns have to pay the highest tax, and even then are only able to 
provide the sum required by law to secure the State appropriation. 
These figures are very suggestive, and show conclusively that no system of schools can 
be maintained throughout the State that shall secure to all the children a chance even 
to get an education without aid from the State; that even with that aid the burdens 
are very unevenly and inequitably distributed.. It is also true, unquestionably, that 
these conditions, instead of diminishing, will increase, and that at some not very distant 
day the State must take measures for further alleviation of these inequalities; for it is not 
right that the discharge of a duty common to all sections of the State alike, and one in 
which all are equally interested, should bear so much more heavily on one than upon | 
another. 
XII.—Scnoor HyGrEene. 
The public is bound to leave nothing undone.—Hon. Andrew 8. Draper: No schoolhouse 
should be erected in any city except upon the most perfect model which science and ex- 
perience can devise, and then under the supervision of the most competent professional 
talent. When the public asks the people of any community to surrender into its hands 
their little ones for 6 hours a day the year around the public is bound to leave nothing 
undone which will protect the health of those children and minister to their comfort. 
Particularly where such large numbers,are congregated in one building is it necessary 
to look continually to heating and ventilation, and light, and sanitation, and high 
stairs, and all the other things of which little ones know nothing, but which may, if 
neglected, injure health permanently and destroy their prospects in life. 
An architect who may be skilled for other work is not competent to erect a large
-P-A-G-E-708
  
  636 ¢ EDUCATION sey 1688- 89, 
schoolhouse unless he cok about schools, has stale actontnonses and gathered his 
information from a broad field. None should be employed who is not especially fitted 
for this exacting requirement or who is not willing to learn from a practical and ex- 
perienced school man who has investiyated the subject. ‘Where a man can be found 
who thoroughly understands the subject and knows what is needed in a building to 
adapt it to the legitimate needs of a great school his services will be cheap at almost any 
cost. Though there has been much improvement in sciiool buildings in recent years 
there has not been the improvement that there should have been, and I venture nothing 
in saying that in the 25 years now before us there will be such a revolution in the way 
of erecting, of warming, of lighting, of ventilating, and of draining schoolhouses as we 
have never dreamed of in the generations gone by. 
XIII.—ScrencE TEACHING. 
It is dangerous to pronounce useless’ what is now wnmerchantable,—Prof. A. 8. Hardy in 
the Chantauquan: Doubtless much of modern scientific research seems misdirected and 
unprofitable to those whose ideas of utility are limited to the practical. What availeth 
it that nonsingular cubics have twenty-seven points at which conics with a six-point con- 
tact can be drawn? None, if there is no ministry to wants higher than those of the 
body, no finer threads in the warp of life than those of profit and loss, no love of truth 
apart from its commercial value. I say none—but it is dangerous to pronounce useless 
what is now unmerchantable. Truths which to-day are of the greatest practical im- 
portance were for centuries held to be but idle speculations and were discovered by 
men who deprecated their application to utilitarian ends. Moreover, every new fact in 
every department of science is useful in the higher sense, for the goal of the race is 
the solution, so far as it lies, of the great problems of the universe. Things not only, 
but theories of things, the intellect craves, and every new fact may well modify theories 
in which as yet it has no place. As furnishing methods for the discovery of facts and 
of those relations between c. which constitute the preoccupation of all science, mathe- 
matics shares in the higher as well as the lower ministry—its empire extending down 
into the smoky atmosphere of industry and toil, and peren where breathes the ambi- 
- tious spirit of pure inquiry. 
From report of the committee on physics-teaching of the American Association for the Ad- 
vancement of Science, T. C. Mendenhall, chairman: It is the opinion of the committee that 
instruction in physics may begin, with profit, in what is generally known as the “ gram- 
mar school.’’ At the same time it is decidedly opposed to any general recommendation 
that it must begin there or in the primary school. Here, perhaps, more than anywhere 
else, nearly everything depends on the teacher. One who has a strong liking for and a 
good knowledge of physics will be tolerably certain to succeed, while another not thus 
equipped for the work is equally certain to fail. Teachers belonging to the first class 
constitute an extremely small percentage of the grand total. In science-teaching in 
grades below the high school, much should be left to the individuality of the teacher. 
As a result of personal taste or previous training and study, one may give elementary 
instruction in botany or in geology or in physiology so as. to be a real inspiration to 
his class, while his instraction in physics might be so intolerably poor as to be unprofit- 
able in the highest degree. The prevailing custom of many public schools which re- 
quires all teachers of a certain grade to teach physics is greatly to be regretted, and 
every effort should be made to show school superintendents that it isa mistake which 
can not be too quickly remedied, 
The rapid advancement which is constantly being made in real scholarship among 
public-school teachers will result in an increased and increasing number of those who 
are competent to teach physics, and while the committee is convinced that, as a means 
of real, honest mental discipline, no branch of natural science is superior to physics, it 
would deprecate its forced introduction into the grammar school under circumstances 
likely to prove disastrous to the best interests of the science. 
2. When taught in the grammar school and by a competent teacher it should be done 
mainly by and through illustrative experiments. 
These may be of the simplest character, involving and exhibiting some of the funda- 
mental principles of the science, and they should generally be made by the teacher, 
the pupil being encouraged to repeat, to vary, and to extend. Habits of observation 
and of thought should be cultivated and such facts of the science as are based on or re- 
late to the principles illustrated and developed should be presented. It is neither desir- 
able nor necessary that 4 any particular order should be followed in presenting the various 
divisions of the subject. The teacher should be guided by circumstances, such as the 
means at his disposal for experiment and illustration, and often by his own taste and 
predilection.
-P-A-G-E-709
       ee t > d 
SCIENCE TEACHING. We eeHs | 
The ease with which apparatus for the illustration of the most important principles 
of physics can be improvised, even when the stock of material at hand is very slender, 
puts the science in the front rank as to availability, and it is especially adapted to the 
requirements, of certain schools both in town and country which, through their situa- 
tion and surroundings, are restricted in their choice of a science subject. If to these 
facts we add another, which is universally admitted, that the physical properties of 
matter are. the first to be recognized, the laws relating to which being, therefore, the 
first to arrest attention, it needs no argument to show that a competent instructor will 
find the study of physics one of the most important educational forces, even in the 
grammar school. ‘ 
3. In any discussion of the character of instruction in physics in the high school, 
one fact of the utmost importance must not be lost sight of. It is that a large majority 
of the young people who are educated in the public schools receive their final scholastic 
training in the high school. 
Tts course of study must be in harmony with this fact, such provision as may be 
made for those who continue their studies in college or university being merely inci- 
dental. Z 
The high-school course in physics must include, therefore, a general treatment, which 
must of necessity be elementary in its character, of all the great divisions of the science. 
It is likewise important that the student should be made acquainted, if only toa 
limited extent, with the methods of physical investigation and that he should be able 
himself to plan and carry out an attack upon some of the simpler problems of the 
science. The value of this work as an educational factor can not be overestimated; it 
is the ‘‘ walking alone ”’ of intellectual infancy. 
It is believed that these two very desirable ends can be reached without giving an 
undue share of the time and energy of the pupil to the subject. Assuming the high- 
school course to consist of four years of three terms each, it is recommended that the 
study of physics should begin not earlier than with the third year; that it should con- 
tinue through one year, three hours a week being devoted to it, not including the time 
necessary for the preparation of the lessons; and that during the first two terms the 
work should be text-book work, accompanied by illustrative experiments performed by 
the instructor and made as complete as his. facilities will allow, while the last term 
should be devoted to simple laboratory exercises. It is hardly necessary to say that 
durmg the last term the three hours per week should be grouped into one exercise 
whenever possible. ‘ 
Of the character of this laboratory practice it may be well to say that no attempt 
should be made to carry the pupil through a very great range of subjects. The end 
sought for can best be reached by a careful and more exhaustive study of a few prob- 
Jems which should be solved with the highest degree of accuracy attainable under the 
circumstances. As far as possible the pupil should be led to read and study books and 
papers bearing upon the particular subject which he has in hand. The time demanded 
by this plan, three hours per week for one school year, barely more than a hundred 
hours in all, is thought to be the least which is likely to produce results at all satis- 
factory, and it is urged that a vastly better arrangement is to allow the study of phys- 
ies to run through two school,years, giving it, in time, the equivalent of five hours per 
week for one year. 
It is well known that many teachers of physics, and many more who are not teach- 
ers of physics, insist on the introduction of laboratory practice from the beginning, some 
even going so far as to claim that the use of the text-book may be entirely dispensed 
with: Without desiring to enter into a discussion of this question we wish to express, 
and with emphasis, our belief that laboratory practice is in general of little real use to 
the student unless he comes to it fairly well-grounded in the fundamental principles of 
the science. ‘The somewhat widespread opinion and practice to the contrary will be 
found, it is thought, to be one of those mistakes in which pedagogics seems to be caught 
on the rebound from other and generally more serious errors. 
    Nothing comparable with the study of sciencific truth.—Dr. Peter Bryce, of Alabama: It 
is plain that the natural sciences are not only adapted to the development of the youthful 
brain, but that they can not be begun too soon. If any mind is to grow to all that 
nature designed it, its functions must be pressed along natural lines for all that they are 
capable of bearing in early youth. Not much fear of overwork if we follow strictly 
natural routes. It is during the period of childhood-that the brain is most impressible, 
mostcapableof development. Teachers above all others should understand these funda- 
mental principies of mental development. A teacher of the young who is nota thorough 
studentof physiology, who has never paid any attention to the laws of mind and heredity, 
and consequently fails to recognize the demands of scientific hygiene, is without such an 
equipment as the nature of his calling imperatively demands,

* i : : a hes : If the discipline of youth is the preparation for a useful and happy life in after years, 
I know of nothing at all comparable, to that end, with the study of truth—scientific 
truth. In active middle life no knowledge is so desirable or so helpful either in broad- 
ening the general culture or enlarging the benevolent aims of the individual. 
in Popular Science Monthly: The purpose of science-teaching as a part of general edu- 
cation is this—to train the judgment through its exercise on first-hand knowledge. . ‘The 
student of science is taught to know what he knows and to distinguish it from what he 
merely remembers or imagines. Our contact with the universe is expressed in what we 
call science. Throughout the ages the growth of the human mind has been in direct 
proportion to the breadth of this contact. To the man without knowledge of science, 
the universe seems small. Science is our perception of realities; and as the realities 
come year by year to occupy a larger and larger place in our life, so the demand for 
more and better training in science will long be an urgent and growing one. But science 
should hold its place in the schools by virtue of its power as an agent in mental training, 
not because of the special usefulness of scientific facts, nor because knowledge of things 
has a higher market value than the knowledge of words. 
‘The time will come when the study of the objects and forces of nature will be as 
much a matter of course in all our schools as the study of numbers, but the science 
work of the next century will not be the work we are doing now. Thescience in our 
schools is too often a make-believe, and the schools will losenothing*when every make- 
believe slips out of thecurriculum. Deeply as I am interested in the progress of science, 
both in school and out, with Professor Huxley ‘‘I would not turn my hand over’? to j 
Science an agent in mental training. —David Starr J on president Indiana University, 
“have biology taught in every school in the land if the subject is taught through books 
only. To pretend to do, without doing, is worse than not to pretend. THe conventional 
‘fourteen weeks’’ in science gives no contact with nature, no training of any sort, no 
information worth having; only a distaste for that class of scattering information which 
is supposed to be science. 
' There is a charm in real’ knowledge which every student feels. The magnet attracts 
iron, to be sure, to the student who has learned the {act from a book, but the fact isreal 
only to the student who has himself felt it pull. It is more than this, it is enchanting” 
to the student who has discovered the fact for himself. To read a statement of the fact 
gives knowledge, more or less complete as the book is accurate or the memory retentive. 
To verify the fact gives training; to discover it gives inspiration. Training and inspira- 
tion, not the facts themselves, are the justification of science-teaching. Facts enough 
we can gather later in life when we are too old to be trained or inspired. * * * 
The essential of method is that we allow nothing to come between the student and 
the object which he studies. The book or chart or lecture which can be used in place 
of the real thing is the thing you should never use. Your students should see for them- 
selves, and draw their own conclusions from what they see. When they have a ground- 
work of their own observations, other facts can be made known to them as a basis for 
. advanced generalization, for the right use of books is as important as their misuse is 
pernicious; but work of this sort belongs to the university rather than to the high school. 
‘You do not wish to have your students tell you from memory the characters of the 
sauropsida as distinguished from the ichthyopsida. What you want is the answer to 
thejr own qnestionings of the frog and the turtle. * * * 
T once visited a large high school, one of the best in the country, with a science 
teacher whose studies have won him the respect of his fellow-workers. But for some 
reason, on that day at least, he failed to bring his own knowledge into the class room. 
I heard him quizzing a class of boys and girls on animals—not on the animals of the 
woods and fields, not on the animals before them, for there were none, but on the 
edentates of South America. An especial point was to find out whether it is the nine- 
banded armadillo (novemeinctus) or the three-banded armadillo (tricinctus) which does not 
dig a hole in the ground for its nest. The hook, written by a man who did not know 
an armadillo from a mud-turtle, gives this piece of information. It was in the lesson, 
and the students must get it. And on this and like subjects these boys and girls were 
wasting their precious time—precious because if they do not learn to observe in their 
youth they will never learn, and the horizon of their lives will be always narrower and 
darker than it should have been. Already the work of that day isa blank. ‘They have 
forgotten the nine-banded armadillo and the three-banded, and so has their teacher, and 
so have I. All that remains with them is a mild hatred of the armadillo and of the 
edentates in general, and a feeling of relief at being no longer under their baleful in- 
fluence. But with this usually goes the determination never to study zodlogy again, 
And when these students later come to the college they know no more of science and 
its methods than they did when at the age of one year they first cried for the moon. 
* * Tonce heard Professor Agassiz say to an assembly of teachers, and I quote
-P-A-G-E-711

from him the more freely because hé gave his life to the task of the introduction of 
right methods into American schoois: : 
“*Select such subjects that your students can not walk out without seeing them. If 
you can find nothing better, take a house fly or a cricket, and let each one hold a speci- 
men while youspeak. * * * Thereis no part of the country where, in the summer, 
you can not get a sufficient supply of the best ofspecimens. Teach your pupils to bring 
themin. Take your text from the brooks and not from the booksellers. * * * Itisbet- 
ter to havea few forms well studied than to teach a little about many hundred species. 
Better a dozen forms thoroughly known as the result of the first year’s work, than to 
have two thousand dollars’ worth of shells and corals, bought from a curiosity store. 
The dozen animals will be yourown. * * * You will find the same elements of 
instruction all about you wherever you may be teaching. You can take your classes 
out and give them the same lessons, and lead them up to the same subjects in one place 
asanother. And this method of teaching children is'so natural, so suggestive, so true. 
That is the charm of teaching from nature. No one can warp her to suit his own views, 
She brings us back to absolute truth so often as we wander.”’ 
XIV.—Sex in EDUCATION. 
Girls superior on the average.—Results of an examination of the school rank of male 
and female pupils of the Brookline (Mass. ) schools, by R. Cyrene Macdonald, in ‘‘ Edu- 
eation:”’ We find that the female pupils under identical school conditions begin at the 
earliest age to excel; we find that this superiority, not so strongly marked in the lower 
classes, becomes so noticeable in the higher as to be absolutely surprising; we find that 
not only are the girls superior on the average, but that the smartest girls are, ina marked 
degree, superior to the smartest boys, and that the dullest girls are less dull than the 
dullest boys. ‘ 
Now, in consideration of these figures, and that they are accurate there can be no doubt, 
and of sufficient number to obviate the possibility of drawing wrong inferences, what are 
we to conclude as to the relative mental capacity of the sexes? Certainly no one who 
has even the rudiments of arithmetical reason can say otherwise than that, at least in 
school life, the female is very much superior to the male. 
School rank as a test of superiority.—F. A. Fernald, in ‘‘ Education,” in reply to the 
above: If girls do get slightly higher marks than boys in school, what does it signify ? 
It is assumed to signify that the girls have superior mental capacity, but really the 
teacher in marking recitations and examinations is not marking the pupils’ ability to 
learn, but their ability to recite, that is, their capacity for putting what they have 
learned into words. | Moreover, what boys do learn does not always indicate how much 
they canlearn. Girls are more dutiful than boys, they are not so prone to neglect their © 
lessons for play, they are more stimulated by rivalry for rank, and by mortification at a 
low place in the class. * * * School marks are affected by so many influences that 
their indications are exceedingly ambiguous, which makes them almost valueless as a 
psychological test. * * * ‘ 
‘The school rank gives little indication of what success the individual will be capable 
of in mature life, for the former depends chiefly on memory, while the latter brings other 
faculties to the front. It is capacity for assimilating and using knowledge, not merely 
for acquiring it, which is demanded in doing the world’s work. How often have the 
precocious youths who gained the highest marks in school failed to make a visible niark 
in the world? 
Woman should cease measuring herself by man’s standard.—F. A, Fernald: Comparing 
the mental capacity of one person as a whole with that of another can give only the 
roughest estimate of the relative worth of the two. The variety which we notice in 
the minds of those around us arises from variations in the strength of their several fac- 
ulties. The science of mind has not yet advanced far enough to give us exact methods 
of measuring faculties, still it has shown beyond the possibility of doubt that while cer- 
tain faculties are stronger in man than in woman, others are stronger in woman than in 
man. It follows that the mind of man is more adapted to some kinds of activity than 
that of women, and vice versa, Hence it is absurd to say that man has a better mind 
than woman without adding what it is better for. It would be like saying that water 
is better than air, which is true with regard to some purposes, and false with regard to 
others. 
It is idle for women to claim that they can equal en in the lines to which men are 
specially adapted, and to plead that only artificial obstacles prevent them. .Men show 
their fitness for a certain career by overcoming such obstacles, It would be a far more 
dignified position for woman to take, to cease measuring herself by man’s standard; to 
maintain that while there are some things which man can do better than she can, there

  are others which she can do better than he, and that her mental qualities, while not the 
same, yet are as valuable to the world as his; and then to set about developing her mind 
in its own proper direction to the highest possible degree. 
The distinct needs and characteristics of the sexes should be recognized. —William Chauncy 
Langdon, in the Century: The ideal education, therefore, whether secular or religious, 
and by whomsoever furnished, should adhere as closely as possible to the family idea. 
It should not only recognize the wholly distinct needs and characteristics of the sexes, 
but it should also, so far as possible, recognize the distinction of personality, and, with 
due regard to those distinctions, educate the whole man—the eye and hand and the 
conscience, as weil as the intellectand the reasoning powers. Certainly a merely polit- 
ical. philosophy of education must logically result in the social obliteration of sex, in 
the gravest wrongs to women, called in grimmest sarcasm her rights, and in the last 
analysis, were it possible, in the moral elimination of the family. 
XV.—SuPERVISION. 
The office of county school commissioner.—State Superintendent A. 8. Draper, of New 
York: It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of this office to the school 
interests of the rural distriots. The powers of the commissioner are large. In the ap- 
portionment of public moneys, the alteration of districts, the selection of sites, the con- 
demnation, erection, and {urnishing of buildings, the care of the institutes, the certify- 
ing and employing of teachers, the course of instruction, the inspection and supervision 
of the schools, in all that goes to the improvement of the schools, he has great responsi- 
bility and great authority. The office requires a man of quick intelligence, fair schol- 
arship, judicial fairness, and unhesitating courage. Yeti there is no standard of qualifi- 
cations forthe position. Allare eligible to it. The commissioner districts are ordinarily 
so large that the best man, giving bis entire time to the work, finds it impossible to 
fully discharge the duties which the law imposes upon him. Yet there are commis- 
sioners who follow other regular employment and attend to the duties of the office of © 
commissioner only to an extent necessary to make it reasonably certain that the salary 
will bepaid. If a proper man ischosen to the position, who will give his bestefforts to the 
work, there will be a continually increasing interest and a substantial improvement in 
the schools of his district during his term. If an unsuitable man is chosen he will act 
as a brake upon the wheels of progress. 
The office is not estimated at its proper consequence and value, and it is, unfortu- 
nately, filled at a general election. Nominations for the position are ordinarily made 
at party conventions called to nominate other county or district candidates, and the 
~ nomination for school commissioner not infrequently goes to settle the supposed claims 
of a candidate who has gained a little prominence by rendering some party service, but 
would hardly aspire toa place estimated to be of much consequence, and who there- 
fore has no particular fitness for this one. Sometimes it is a matter of bargain between 
different towns in the same assembly district, one taking one nomination and one an- 
other without regard to the fitnessof men. In some cases there is an unwritten law by 
which this nomination is passed around the district. In not a few cases it is given toa 
back town, no matter how weak its candidates may be, in order to mitigate the disap- 
pointment and avoid the future trouble, which are quite likely to follow a long-contin- 
ued refusal of its demands for a higher place. 
From this it is not to be supposed that all districts treat the position with this indif- 
fereuce, or that all commissioners are unfit for their work. Probably more than a ma- 
jority are as well qualified as may be desired, and are unremitting and conscientious in 
their efforts to meet all the demands of their exacting positions. But there are not a 
few chosen at each election who have no qualifications for the position, who are unable 
to fill it, who never come into sympathy with it, who stand in the way of educational 
advancement, and are a continual menace to all engaged in the work. To finda pra 
tical remedy is difficult. If there could be some limit placed upon eligibility to the oltice; 
if it could be provided that only the graduates of colleges, academies, normal schools, or 
high schools, or the holders of teachers’ certificates of specified grade, could be elected. 
to the position, it might be well. If the office were filled at an election held for this 
particular purpose, it is likely that public attention would be concentrated upon it, and 
that there would be less possibility of bad results. Indeed, if political parties would 
nominate for the office at conventions held for this particular purpose, there would be 
greater certainty of the best results. It is quite possible, too, that filling the office 
through appointment by the county judges would work a salutary improvement. Bet- 
ter than ail else, if there was more public interest in the matter, fuller appreciation of 
the influence which the position exerts upon the schools, and strength of feeling which 
would tolerate none but men of pure life, ample qualifications and experience, with a

real interest in the schools, in the responsible office of school commissioner, there would 
be an advance in the work of the rural schools which would surprise and gratify the peo- 
ple of the State. . 
Alabama county superintendents.—State Superintendent Solomon Palmer: For many 
years the State has had what might be termed county supervision, and yet it is more 
nominal than real. We have in name county superintendents, but in contemplation of 
Jaw and in reality they are mere disbursing officers. The duties prescribed for them in 
the law look mainly to a faithful application of the school funds. Nowhere does the 
Jaw intimate that it is their duty to visit the public schools of the county. Oa 
The salary of these county superintendents is only $75 and 2 per cent. commission on 
the school funds disbursed by them, when county treasurers, who are charged with far 
less responsibility and whose duties are much less onerous, receive 5 per cent. on all funds 
disbursed by them—more than twice the compensation of county superintendents and 
with less work and responsibility. With such small compensation it is not expected, or 
required by the law, that county superintendents should devote their time to the visita- 
tion of the publie schools and the instruction of the teachers. is < x ‘ 
No public-school system can be developed and properly administered without close 
and faithful visitation and supervision, and this can not be secured without better com- 
pensation for county and township superintendents. Our school fund isso small that 
I would recommend to the counties that they secure the necessary legislation to secure 
this school supervision, by paying county and township superintendents out of county 
funds. This would leave the school fund of the county intact as now, and secure an 
increased efficiency in the adminisiration of the public schools of the county that would 
soon demonstrate the wisdom of such legislation and the additional outlay of county 
funds. Jefferson County, three years ago, passed an act allowing her county superin- 
tendent $65 per month in excess of that allowed by law, and I understand that the peo- 
ple see its beneficial effects and the law is growing in popularity in that county. 
    
The worst use to which to put a county superintendent.—Superintendent Henry Sabin, of 
Towa: In our more populous counties the county superintendent should be allowed the 
services of a deputy during a part of the year to aid him in looking over examination 
papers, in conducting his correspondence, and in the details of his office work. “ 
Tis own time should be very largely given to visiting schools, inspecting the work of 
teachers, settling trifling misunderstandings which often arise in the district, holding 
township meetings and institutes, and in creating by his personal influence a healthy 
public opinion in favor of good schools. About the worst use to which we can puta 
county superintendent is to confine him within the walls of his office, doing the work 
which a clerk could do as well, while he himself ought to be out among his schools, 
directing, encouraging, stimulating, everywhere making his influence felt by his energy 
and enthusiasm. 
Loaded down too much at the head.—State Superintendent John Hancock, of Ohio: It is 
just possible that in some of our large cities we have, as has been the case in some of the 
large cities of other States, gone beyond the golden mean, and have loaded our schools 
down too much at the head. It is not difficult to descend from the generous scheme of 
supervision, where every encouragement and aid is extended to the teacher’s spontaneity - 
and individuality, toa mechanical scheme of division and subdivision and authoritative 
prescription of every detail of work, which is the most dreadful condition into whichany 
school system can fall. 
The wisest economy.—State Superintendent John W. Dickinson, of Massachusetts: 
Where the superintendents prove themselves to be experts in their profession and'suc- 
ceed in making the other appropriations add vigor to the work of the schools, the in- 
creasing sum paid to these officials is the wisest economy. 
Where the greatest hope for advancement lies. —A.W. Edson, agent of the Massachusetts 
State board of education: The more I study the present condition and future outlook of 
our schools, country, village, and city, the more I am convinced that for any decided 
and permanent advancement, their hope lies in efficient supervision. There may be 
from time to time in certain places a noticeable improvement in methods and results, 
owing to the selection of a specially competent teacher or committee; but the advance 
will be only temporary. Occasionally there are found committees who have the time, 
inclination, ability, and the previous training which fit them to direct the work of 
teachers; but these are few and far between. Nor should supervisory work be required 
of committees. ‘They may perform all the legitimate duties connected with the school ~ 
board faithfully and conscientiously, and still have very little time to give to a study of 
educational literature, to the philosophy of education, to new and advanced methods, to 
visiting other and better schools than are found in their own town, and attending edu- 
cational gatherings. Of necessity the vision of the average committeeman is limited on

_ school questions, as on law, medicine, or any business for which he has not had special 
training, and to which he does not give his undivided time and attention. And one fact 
is quite noticeable, which in itself speaks volumes: those committeemen who are best 
fitted to inspect schools and direct school werk are always most favorably disposed » 
toward supervision; they recognize its need and value. 
XVII.—Townsuip System, | 
A term one-third longer.—Report of Chesterfield (N. H.) school committee: In present- 
ing to you the third report under the new school system we are able trom a longer trial 
of the law to emphasize the statement made in the first report, that ‘‘all the scholarsin 
town have had the opportunity of attending a term of school averaging one-third longer’? 
than under the old régime ‘* for nearly the same amount of money expended.” 
A saving of $500.—School committee of Oxford, N. H.: All the scholars in this district, 
have had the benefit of thirty weeks’ schooling at a saving of $500 from what it would 
have cost under the old district system for the same number of weeks, That speaks a 
good word for the new school law.    
More days of schooling than ever before known.—School committee of Pembroke, N. H.: 
With over $500 less public money than of late years, the children of the town have been 
given as many days of schooling during the past year as they have in any of our cities, 
and more than ever known before in the history of the town. It has been necessary to’ 
support only eight schools—five less than under the district system. 
“Six weeks longer school term.—School committee of Sanbornton, N. H.: We get more 
schooling for our money than formerly, under the district system. The appropriation 
for schooling, $1,423, would have, on the average basis of appropriation under the old 
system for its last five years, a fraction over fifteen weeks. Under the new it hasgiven 
twenty-one weeks, besides furnishing fuel in full and paying other incidental expenses. 
Working of the new system in New Hampshire.-—School board of Stewartstown: Under 
the new [town] system, school boards are unavoidably subjected to unpleasant and often 
unjust criticisms. Refusal to hire those who, upon examination, appear least qualified 
to teach is among the disagreeable duties to be met; but the very nature of the cases, 
with the probabilities of incurring sacrifices of friendship without any equivalent in 
return, ought to convince every reasonable individual that the board thus act from a 
sense of official obligation, and for no other reason. Particular schools are often sought 
by teachers, or their parents for them. Most teachers are much better adapted to 
instruct and govern some schools than others; and when it is necessary to make an 
adjustment by comparing the compensation the several teachers ought to command with 
the wages established for the different school, it is often very difficult to favorably con- 
sider these requests. i 
Advantages apparent.—School board of Sutton, N. H.: In submitting this, our third 
annual report under the new system, we refer with satisfaction to the condition of our 
schools, No one can fail to see the advantages of the town system. The money is more 
evenly apportioned throughout the town, and the children in outlying sections receive 
better instruction and more schooling. 
The most serious defect, —Report of Superintendent Frank M. Smith,of Tennessee: You 
will find the best schoolsin those States where the ‘‘township’’ plan prevails.’ I therefore 
most earnestly urge your honorable bodies to make as few changes in the school district 
lines as possible, and at all times strive to make the school district and the civil district 
identizal. The most serious defect in the management of our schools has grown out of 
this changing of school districts and establishing too many schools. We have more than 
twice as many schools as we should have. 
  The political theory on which the district organization is founded.—Superintendent B. A. 
Hinsdale, of Cleveland, Ohio: It is a significant fact that the political theory upon which 
the district school organization depends is a theory which has been almost universally 
abandoned for all other purposes whatsoever. We all know that there is no line of polit- 
ical or social development along which the English race has made more progress than 
along the line of local political organization. Itis one of the glories of the English race, 
admitted to be such by all competent authorities. We know, in the second place, that 
the old Saxon theory of carrying on government was democratical. The people met in 
public assembly, and there they voted, in their way, some questions up and some ques- 
tions down. But democratic government was found not to work well, and representa- 
tive government was set up in its place. In New England the democratic system of 
local government prevails to a considerable extent, but in its extreme form it has been 
1 
 
-P-A-G-E-715
    ‘TOWNSHIP SYSTEM, 643 
abolished. It can not meet with good results, for the reason that in its extreme form 
it was found too complicated. The representation principle is the one that prevails in ’ : 
school matters where the township system exists. The people have the ballot-box, and 
elect men whose business it, is to administer town government. But for some reason 
the American people have clung more closely to the antiquated method of carrying for- | 
ward local government in education than anywhere else. ‘They have clung, in many of 
the States, to the ancient democratical idea and shunned the representative idea. The 
district system is very dear to the hearts of very many people. But anyone who will 
inquire into the facts can hardly avoid coming to the conclusion that, upon the face of 
it, it is an absurdity. : 
In every district in Ohio, for example, there are three school directors, The town- 
ship clerk has certain educational duties to perform, and so have the county auditor 
aud treasurer and the county board of examiners. And I remember that, some years 
ago there were engaged 40,000 persons in administering the publie'schools of Ohio. Nor 
does this number include the teachers. About that time there were required to man the 
schools 13,000 teachers. You put these two numbers in ratio, and it will appear that for 
every teacher employed there were three and one-third directors, inspectors, supervisors, 
or call them what you will, and they did not do the duties for which they were elected. 
They did hire the teachers, but so far as inspection or supervision was concerned, the 
cases were exceedingly rare where anything of that kind was done at all. It was the 
natural course of things. What is left to so many hands to do is not, as a matter of 
fact, done at all. Power is divided and responsibility is destroyed, f 
A plausible argument in behalf of the district system is, that the schools are very near 
tho hearts of the people, as is shown by the fact that they have retained ancient demo- 
cratic ideas in school management more fully than in anything else. Then it will be 
argued that this shows proper interest, and that the school will be more properly ad- 
ministered by the people who are near the school and interested in it than by those at 
adistance. But all the analogies bearing on the question point to the foolishness of 
this conclusion. 
In the State of Ohio the township is divided into road districts, and the keeping up of 
the public roads is committed to a supervisor, and the people are required to work out ~ 
their taxes under the law. I have worked on the roads many a day, and I want to say, 
of all the shiftless and inefficient work with which I ever had anything to do the most 
shiftless was that done on the county roads., My father was often supervisor, and I well 
remember occasions when there were heart-burnings between him and his neighbors be- 
cause he insisted that the road work should be well done, while they were determined 
toslight the work, as they had always done. And yet it is hard to think of a public in- 
terest lying nearer a farmer’s door that more concerns his comfort and convenience than 
the country road. Antecedently, we would expect the people would take aninterest in 
keeping the roads in prime condition, but they do nothing of the kind. i 
The district system of conducting common schools rests upon an idea, and proceeds 
by means of an organization that has not been preserved by English-speaking people for 
any other purpose save for the one to which I have just made referencc—the roads. And 
it would be hard to say which are the worse managed, the schools or the roads. 
Efficient teachers not to be had under the district system.—Prof. 8. D. Barr, of Albion 
(Mich, ) College: Nothing is more repugnant to my feelings than to unjustly and un- fairly characterize the teachers in the weaker districts. They are not to be blamed. 
Those in the nonprogressive districts are entitled to our fraternal sympathy. They are victims to circumstances that bind them with shackles and paralyze their energies, » Some of them, nevertheless, do excellent service. Many more would become efficient teachers if they held close relation to acompetent superintendent, whose duty it should be to direct and instruct them in their work. Butthis can never be eftected under the present system, with small and independent districts. A multitude of others have insufficient acquirements and mental culture, hardly any knowledge of school organization and of the principles and proper methods of instruction, and these should not, be permitted to teach. It is incomparably more important that the children of the State shall be well taught than that a few young people, who ought to be enrolled as pupils, shall be per mitted, as teachers, to experiment aimlessly, while the children lose the advantages tha /. efficient instruction would give. 
The township system in Michigan.—State Supt. Joseph Estabrook again urges upon the legislature an amendment to the school law providing for township school districts. ‘The idea of consolidating all the schools of a township under the management of one board is not an untried experiment in Michigan. Several townships have already adopted this plan through special legislation. Bills were introduced in 1861 and 1885 to rhake the township system generai, but failed to pass the legislature. \ The evils of unequal school terms and inequality in the cost of maintaining schools

      644 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
are observable in Michigan under the district system, as well as elsewhere. In Alcona 
Township, with four school districts, one district maintained no school at all, one for 
only three months, a third for nine months, and the fourth for ten months. Similar 
instances might be cited from nearly every county in the State. The cost of education 
per pupil ranged from $4.04 to $27.55'in the different districts. 
‘“The reports from Alpena County furnish some significant facts bearing upon 
the equalization of school privileges and of the cost of maintaining schools under 
the township plan. In this county tive townships have their schools organized on the 
township plan by special legislation. Two retain the district system. The average 
per capita expense of the schools in the township districts for the last school year, as 
shown by the reports of township boards of school inspectors, was $13.71, and in those 
retaining the district system it was $14.80. The average length of school in the town- 
ship districts was nine months and in the others only four and one-half months. In 
. otber words, it cost $14.80 to give each child four and one-half months’ schooling in the 
towns retaining the district system, while in those operated under the township plan 
the cost per pupil for nine months’ schooling was $13.71.”? 
Among the other defects of the district system Superintendent Estabrook mentions 
the too great diversity of text-books; too many school officers; unjust discrimination in 
local taxation; frequent changes of teachers in the same school; lack of proper classifi- 
cation and grading; quarrels over the selection of schoolhouse sites and the establish- 
ment of district boundaries; children forced to attend school in their own district when 
they could be more conveniently accommodated in an adjoining district. 
The question of text-book uniformity as affected by the township system is well 
illustrated by the reports from Alpena County. ‘‘In the township of Alpena, which re- 
tains the district system, there were five different text-books in orthography and read- 
ing used in the several districts, three varieties of arithmetics, and three different text- 
books in United States history. Thetownship of Ossineke is divided into three districts, 
District No. 1, with an enrolment of sixteen pupils, reported as used in the school 
three different text-books in each of the branches of orthography, writing, and geog- 
raphy, two in reading and English grammar each, and four in arithmetic. Thus in one 
small district school we find seventeen different text-books used in teaching six branches 
of study. 
On the other hand, in the five townships of Alpena County operating under township 
system the text-books are uniform in each instance.

   CHAPTER XXI (A). 
THE UNIVERSITY OF THE FUTURE. 
AN EDUCATIONAL SPECULATION. . Rs 
By R. G. Moutton, M. A., Cambridge, England. 
The fact on which this conception of the ‘‘ University of the Future’? rests is the 
changed attitude of the public mind to adult education. 
EDUCATION ONE OF THE INTERESTS OF LIFE. 
Education is no longer regarded as belonging to one period of life or to particular 
learned classes, but is tending to be recognized as a constant interest of adult life, side 
by side with religion, politics, and commerce. Just as, historically, religious and politi- 
cal administration, once in the hands of special classes, has (by a series of revolutions) 
become an interest of the nation as a whole, so education ‘seems (without the need of 
revolution) to be passing through similar changes. When the tendency is complete we 
may expect to see the (adult) nation all over the country organizing itself for educational 
purposes, still making use of ‘‘ uniyersities,’”’ ‘‘ colleges,’’ etc., as bodies of educational 
specialists, but itself carrying on the administration of the education in local institu- 
tions or unions of local institutions, so that universities, such as Oxford, Cambridge, 
Durham, etc., will be merged in a wider University of England, just as *‘ the state’’ 
means [not Parliament but] the nation acting in its political capacity [through Crown, 
Houses of Parliament, municipal councils, local boards, magistrates, juries, electoral 
constituents, ete. ], so the ‘‘ University of England’? will mean the (adult) nation acting 
in its educational capacity [through whatever local and central institutions may be 
found convenient]. 
     BUT WHY CALL THIS ‘‘A UNIVERSITY’?? 
1. “University”? is the Latin for ‘‘Guild,’”’ specialized by usage to association for 
higher education. Thus theoretically: . 
School education is taken (1) under external discipline (2) in the period of pupilage 
(3) as a preparation for mature life. 
University education is (1) voluntary (2) in the period of maturity (3) as an end in 
itself. 
If this is so, why should any adult person’ be without university education ? 
2. Connection between school and university education.—(a) Perhaps no single thing . 
would contribute more to the happiness of life than to give every man an intelligent 
interest in the occupation hy which he wins his bread. (5) Schoo) education is a prac- 
tical preparation for life; but life means leisure as well as business. (c) Every school 
education isa failure that is not self-continuing in some one point. (d) There must 
often be a gulf between school and university education; it is the purpose of ‘‘night 
schools,”’ ‘‘ half-time systems,’”’ and especially ‘‘ recreative education ” to bridge over 
this gulf. 
THE GENERAL FORM THAT SUCH A UNIVERSITY WILL PRESENT. 
             _1. It will not be a chartered body like existing universities, but a floating aggrega- 
tion of voluntary agencies; not so much organized as tending to codperate [compare com-

merce]. The constituent elements of the university would everywhere have the same 
double form, a local management by association (voluntary and temporary) for educa- 
tional purposes [educational churches, so to speak] connected with educational institu- 
tions [either central, like existing ‘‘universities,’’ or local ‘‘colleges,’” or itinerant 
systems, like the present ‘‘ university-extension movement,’’ or government depart- 
ments, like South Kensington, or institutions of private enterprise], the underlying 
principle being the carrying out of self-government in education, the application of self- 
education to a. nation. 
2. Note.—Absence of compulsion—contrast to continental government systems of higher 
education. 
  WHAT WOULD SUCH A UNIVERSITY BE LIKE(1) AS TO THE MACHINERY OF ITS 
EDUCATION? 
1. The question of waiversity discipline.—There would be absolutely none. For it 
must be substituted (1) the personal influence of the teacher, to whom the freest scope 
must be allowed; (2) the complete self-responsibility of the learner, itself an educating 
influence. q 
2. One fundamental difference from prevailing university methods: the substitution 
of the teaching system for the examination system. i 
(a) Alleducation implies (1) machinery for teaching; (2) machinery for testing. Itis 
obvious that the latter is a means and the former is theend; but at present the position 
of the two is reversed, ane the teacher has to adapt his teaching to external examina- 
tions. ’ 
(b) Evils of the present Spare onal tiaier influence of the teacher; mechanical uni- 
porary results rather than permanent habits; uneven pres- 
sure; unprogressiveness without friction. 
(¢) How the evil has arisen, —It is an unfortunate feature of the present university sys- 
tems that the education of the general public is not distinguished from the education 
of specialists [doctors, lawyers, and especially teachers]; for the latter [who need 
“‘qualifications’’] the machinery of testing has an exceptional importance, which is 
allowed to extend into general education, 7 
(d@) A specimen of the teaching system is the university extension method of syllabus, 
weekly exercises, and final examination, and certificates dependent on the two combined. 
(e) In this connection two points are often raised: 
(1) Danger of lowering the standard.—The true way to ‘‘raise the standard ’’ is not 
to increase the difficulty of passing at the end [i. ¢., increase the chance of 
failure], but to increase the effectiveness of teaching and the inclination 
to learn at all points.of the course [7. e., increase the chance of success]. 
(11) How to deal with competition.—Abolish it wherever possible. The teaching 
system readily shows ‘‘ pass’? and ‘‘distinction;’’ any further application of 
competition is, in higher education, mischievous. [The case is different 
‘ ‘ where money assistance has to he dispensed. ] 
3. The question of recognition for education: degrees, ete.—The true policy is not tos 
multiply the degree-giving bodies, introducing confusion and impairing tite value of de- 
grees (¢. g., their antiquity), but to introduce elasticity into the machinery of testing 
for degrees. A fundamental error of the present system is the requirement of identical 
study dnd examinations from all taking the same degree, instead of applying a common 
standard of examination fe a variety of subjects. [The latter system found perfectly 
practicable in the university-extension system, by aid of the teacher's sy//abus. ] 
4,, The question of curricula, or complete schemes of study.—The first object of such 
a university will be to look after its educational unit, i,¢c., the application of the most 
thorough method to a very limited field. [In the university-extension scheme this 
‘unit?’ is the three months’ course in a single subject.] Completer schemes must be 
made up of such units, ad as to be adopted in greater or less extent according to circum- 
stances. 
[An example is the Cambridge course of affiliated students. ] ‘ 
5. The question of residence as an element in education, Such a university will se- 
eure for 4 few, residence in a university town, as the apex of its system; for the many, 
association of students for mutual encouragement and work—both (1) in assisting one 
another in the work set by teachers, and (2) meeting for independent discussion, prac- 
tical work, excursions, etc. 
.6. The question of financial management. 
(a) Higher education has no market vatue, and therefore in all cases some form of en- 
dowment is necessary—by which is meant: that some persons contribute more to it than 
others. 
   
-P-A-G-E-719
    
THE UNIVERSITY OF THE FUTURE. 647 
(b) Importance of codperation between local institutions to prevent educational waste, 
and to unite in common homes, such as town institutes, musewms, ete., using the same 
buildings and apparatus. : 
(¢) The system of such a national university must be throughout animated by the 
missionary spirit, its duty not only to supply education but also to stimulate the demand 
for it,

Plans of study should be self-explaining, taking the student into confidence. And 
generally: The first duty of education is to be interesting—this easily carries method (but, 
  
not vice versa) and self-continuance. 
Natural science. —This department is immensely in advance of the other two in sound 
method and vitality—one defect: the tendency to teach it in ‘‘subjects’’ instead of in- 
venting ‘‘lines of study’’ that will cross several ‘‘subjects,’’ and illustrate the different 
operation of common principles. } 
Art,—In this department it is highly necessary to distinguish: education in art-pro- 
duction—for those who have special talent; education in art-appreciation for all, 
Humanity.——On the history side this department is flourishing; on the side of litera- 
ture it is a chaos. Two fundamental changes essential for realizing any scheme of pop- 
ular liberal education. 
  (A) 
‘1, The great representative of this department in prevailing systems is the study 
known as ‘‘classics’’—round which a fierce educational conflict rages. 
Note.—The question is not between humanity and natural science, for every educa- 
tionist would recognize both, but between true and false modes of arriving at the object 
of classical studies. 
2. The term ‘‘classics ’’ covers a confusion between two distinct studies: the study 
of language—valuable, mainly as a discipline; the study of literature—indispensable, 
as the leading element of culture. a 
Classicai studies as at present organized totally fail as a training in literature—the 
vast proportion of persons who have received a classical education have had no education in 
literature. 
3. How the evil hasarisen: Originally classics were a complete education in themselves: 
the difficulty of dead languages gave discipline, and the Greek and Roman literatures 
gave culture—when science, mathematics, ete., forced their way into educational pro- 
grammes the time devoted to classics was necessarily reduced—such reduction must be 
made in the culture side of classics, which does not commence till the languages are mas- 
tered—thus at presentin the great proportion of school and university students the cul- 
ture side of classics is neverreached, and the study becomes merely one of discipline. 
4. Disastrous results: Except in rare cases a classica! education evokes no interest in 
classics or disposition to continue the study—scandalous lack of any methodical study 
of literature—classics 
becomes pure gymnastic, generating intellectual indifference—schism between scientists 
and humanitarians in the absence of literature as the great common ground between spe- 
cialists—generally: in clamoring for the uame we are losing the thing, and building up 
@ prejudice against classics in the popular mind. ' \ 
5. One suggested remedy: Give up Latin and Greek, and let us be taught oar own 
* literature.—But what is ‘tour own literature?”? The main writers of Greece and ome 
more truly our literary ancestors than Eng ish writers of past generations, 
6. True solution : not English literature, but literature in English: Let the best lit- 
erature (of Greece, Rome, England, or any other country) be studied in our mother 
tongue [this is the trae meaning of ‘‘Classies’’] as the staple of culture forall. Let 
Greek aud Latin as languages appear in educational schemes as gymnastic (or supple 
menting literature) according to the ability and time of each student. 
7. Difficulty to be met: Prejudice against translated literature as ‘* brummagem 
goods.’”” But this is largely a false sentiment of exclusive connoisseurship—the objector

often a victim of the present system to whom literature has come to mean language — 
main part of total literary effect deeper down than superficial distinctions of lan- 
guages—compare old opposition to translation of the Bible. 
8. On the other hand: No thorough study of literature possible except hy aid of transta- 
tions—thoroughness implies (a) covering rapidly wide fields [otherwise degenerates into 
‘‘annotation ’?]—and (4) comparison of many literatures [compare studies of history, 
~ etymology ]—the world’s “‘ classics?’ are not national, but universal. 
(B) 
1. Asecond essential change: to recognize the Dible as literature—quite independently 
of its higher purposes. [Contrast the use of the Koran. ] 
2. For. purposes of literary training the Bible has peculiar fitness: the familiarity of 
the matter applies the study at an immense advantage—it presents a continuous and 
complete literature within a practicable compass—it is the greatest of our literary ances- 
tors. 
3. Difficulty: Fear of raising points of religious difference.—Answer: Literary study 
need in no way touch authorship, authority, historic value, or (theological) interpreta- 
_tion, but only analyze the literary form in which the truth is conveyed, bringing out 
its elements of beauty and stopping at the literary interpretation which is the common 
starting point of different theological interpretations, , 
CONCLUSION. 
‘The advance towards such a university of the future is to be made, not by reforming 
existing systems, attack being usually a bad policy—but by obtaining a free field for tent- 
ative educational progress in the case of the new classes that are being attracted to 
higher education,

  CHAPTER XXI (B). 
FELLOWSHIPS IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
The great prominence given to fellowships and scholarships by some of our universities 
most recently founded, and the results obtained from the use of them, have prompted a 
brief investigation and discussion of this very important subject. ‘ 
The usual method adopted by benevolent and philanthropic persons for assisting 
students to obtain an education is the endowment of fellowships and scholarships. 
Fellowships are bestowed only upon persons who have already received their first degree 
or who give evidence of being well prepared to pursue higher studies. They are par- 
_ ticularly designed for such persons as give special promise of future success in certain 
lines of study. The income of fellowships ranges from $200 to $750 per annum. 
Scholarships are conferred upon both graduates ahd undergraduates, and are generally 
a reward for work already done. They have a wide range of values, from a few dollars 
to at least $500. Fellowships are confined to university courses, while scholarships per- 
tain both to university and college courses. ; 
Johns Hopkins University, from its very opening, made provision for twenty fellow- 
ships, whose purpose is thus set forth in the annual register of that institution: 
“Twenty fellowships, each yielding $500, but not exempting the holder from the 
charges for tuition, are annually awarded in this university. 
“The system of fellowships was instituted for the purpose of affording to young men 
of talent from any place an opportunity of continuing their studies in the Johns Hop- 
  kins University, while looking forward to positions as professors, teachers, and investi- — 
gators, or to other literary and scientific vocations. The fellowships are given to young 
men who wish to follow systematically through the year the instruction of the teachers 
here engaged, and those who are appointed are’ expected to proceed to the degree of 
doctor of philosophy. The appointments are not made as rewards for good work al- 
ready done, but as aids and incentives to good work in the future; in other words, the 
fellowships are not so much honors and prizes bestowed for past achievements, as helps 
to further progress and stepping stones to honorable intellectual careers. They are not 
offered to those who are definitely looking forward to the practice of any one of the three 
learned professions (though such persons are not formally excluded from the competi- 
tion), but are bestowed almost exclusively on young men desirous of becoming teachers 
of science and literature, or proposing to devote their lives to special branches of learn- 
ing which lie outside of the ordinary studies of the lawyer, the physician, and the min- 
ister. Appointments are rarely, if ever, made of graduates of more than five years’ 
standing,”’ ‘ 
The following are the principal regulations concerning candidates and holders of these 
fellowships: 
1. The application must be made prior to May 1 in writing, addressed to the presi- 
dent of the university, and he will refer the papers to the academic council, by whom 
the nominations will be made to the board of trustees at their meeting in June. 
2. The candidate must give evidence of a liberal education, such as the diploma ofa 
college of good repute; of decided proclivity towards a special line of study, such as an 
example of some scientific or literary work already performed; and of upright character, 
such as a testimonial from some instructor. 
3. The value of each fellowship is $500. The holder is not exempt from the charges 
for tuition. In case of resignation, promotion, or removal from the fellowship, payments 
will be made for the time during which the office shall have been actually held. 
4. Every holder of a fellowship will be expected to perform such duties as may be 
allotted to him in connection with his course of study, to act when called upon as an 
examiner or as moderator in the examination room, to give all his influence for the pro- 
motion of scholarship and good order, and in general to codperate in upholding the effi- 
ciency of the university, as circumstances may suggest. He must reside in Baltimore 
during the academic year.

    B: He will be expected to ere his time to the ebeseaHod of special studies (not | 
i professional) under the direction\of the head of the department to which he belongs, 
and before the close cf the year to give evidence of progress by the preparation of a 
thesis, the completion of a research, the delivery of a lecture, or by some other method. 
6. He may give instruction, with the approval of the president, by lectures or other- 
wise, to persons connected with the university, but he may not engage in teaching else- 
where. 
7. He may be reappointed at the end of the year, but only for exceptional reasons. 
8. Usually not more than two fellows will be appointed in any department of study. 
9, As these fellowshipsare awarded as honors, those who are disposed, for the benefit 
of others or for any other reason, to waive the pecuniary emolument, may do so, and 
still have their names retained on the honor list. 
The annual register for 1889-90 has. been carefully examined with a view to ascer- 
taining the results accomplished by these important provisions. From this investigation 
it appears that the total number of men appointed to fellowships by Johns Hopkins Uni- 
versity from 1876 to 1888 is 190, 3 of whom did not enter on the fellowships, leaving 
187 who really became fellows of the university. Of thisnumber, 148, or 79.1 per cent., 
haye, at some time since their incumbency, been engaged in teaching, mainly in colleges 
and universities; 16, or 8.6 per cent., are.engaged in scientifie pursuits, while 11, or 5.9 
per cent., are still pursuing their studies. ‘The total number of men now living who have 
held fellowships is 179, of which number 124, or 69.3 per cent., are at the present time 
engaged in teaching. ‘Of those formerly teaching 6 are now dead, 2 have resumed the:r 
studies, and 2 are engaged in scientific pursuits. , 
In addition to the twenty fellowships above mentioned, the Adam T’. Bruce feliow- 
ship, founded as a memorial of Adam ‘T. Bruce, PH.D., late fellow and instructor in 
the university, will be awarded annually. It is tobe bestowed by the appointing board 
upon the candidate whom they consider most likely to promote biological science, and 
especially morphology, by original research. The stipend will be the income of $10,000. 
Also, the academic council may, at their discretion, by special vote, enroll as fellows 
by courtesy— 
(a) Gentlemen who are or who have been teachers in colleges and other like institu- 
tions, and who wish, for brief periods, to avail themselves of the opportunities here af: 
forded for study and for the use of books and laboratories. 
(b) Holders of fellowships in other colleges, during their residence here. 
(e) Those who have been fellows of this university and desire to continue in residence. 
Fellows by courtesy are not exempt from the payment of fees, except by a special vote. 
That fellowships are meeting with popular approval and their value admitted and 
appreciated can be seen by the continued endowinentof such foundations. When Clark 
University, Worcester, Mass., was founded, Mr. Jonas G. Clark, the founder, in addi- 
tion to all his previous gifts, paid into the treasury full tuition of $200 each for 30 stu- 
dents, For 8 of these students thus freed from tuition healso established 8 fellowships, 
yielding each holder $400 per annum, and 8 more fellowships, yielding each holder $200 
perannum. Mrs, Clark established 2 fellowships yielding $40 each, and 2 fellowships 
yielding $200 each per annum. 
Harvard University, according to its latest report, owns 24 fellowships, 11 of which 
may be called traveling fellowships, since the conditiens by which they were given to 
Harvard enable the holders thereof to pursue their studies either at Harvard or else- 
where. The income of the fellowships of the institution are as follows: Two have an 
annual income of $750 each; 4 of $700; 1 of $550; 12 of $500; and 3 of $450, Of the 
other 2 no mention is made in the latest annual catalogue. Two of these fellowships 
are for use in the theological department; 2 are uot specified, while the remaining 20 
are for use in the graduate department. At least 9 of the fellowships are open to grad- 
uates of colleges other than, Harvard. The following interesting Tecord is taken from 
the annual report of President Eliot of Harvard University for the Year 1888-89; 
“'The record of the 87 persons who have held Harvard fellowships in Europe from 1873 
to 1839 and haye returned to the United States is an interesting one, although the 
number of individuals is not large enough to establish any general | conclusion. ‘Three 
of the 37 have died, one shortiy : after his return from Europe, another as professor in 
this university, and the third as professor in another university, The remaining 34 are 
now distributed as follows,

  ‘Of the 25 surviving persons who are not now in the service of this university, 12 
have been in its employ for longer or shorter periods since their return from Europe. 
Out of the 37. 27 have become professional teachers of hizh grade; but of these teachers, 
17 ultimately took service in other institutions. It is a fair question for discussion 
whether fellowships available in Europe or fellowships available only at the university 
are most useful. For the purpose of building up a graduate departinent in a given in- 
stitution, fellowships available only at that institution are best, but lor serving the com- 
mon cause of education in the country at large there is much to be said for fellowships 
available in Europe, ‘Thig university is glad to possess both kinds. 
“As the traveling fellowships have heretofore been administered, few persons except 
Harvard bachelors of arts have enjoyed them, and most of the incumbents have held 
them for three years by repeated annual appointment. It would, perhaps, bean improve- 
ment to use the traveling fellowships chiefly as prizes for graduate students who have 
already passed one or two years at the university and to reduce the time during which 
they are commonly held to two years, or even to one year. Under such asystem these 
fellowships would oftener be held by graduates of other colleges than Harvard, and a ° 
much larger number of persons would enjoy for a time the great stimulus of study in 
Europe. Moreover, the incumbents would on the average be better prepared than they 
are now to profit by a residence abroad.’’ 
The desirability of extending the privileges of fellowships in the leading universities 
to other than their own graduates is very generally recognized. With reference to this 
subject, Daniel Kilham Dodge, fellow at Columbia College, in a paper on ‘‘ The Func- 
tions of University Fellowships,’’ read before the regents of the University of the State 
of New York, July 11, 1888, says: 
“The eligibility of candidates for fellowships is another very important point. At 
present, unless I greatly mistake, Johns Hopkins is the only American university that 
bestows fellowships upon students other than graduates in its own course, and to this 
far-sighted policy is largely due the success of this school. Most of our colleges are un- 
provided with thorough courses of post-graduate study, and their, graduates, if they de- 
sire to pursue such courses, must attend other seats of learning. Now, it is manifestly 
unfair, besides being highly inadvisable, to refuse these applicants any of the advantages 
enjoyed by the otherstudenis, Besides, it savors too much of a protective tariff. Whether’ 
or not we believe in free competition between traders, we must all of us believe in free 
competition between brain workers, and anything thatis opposed to this principle is 
unwise and unjust. We should do well to copy the University of Copenhagen, at 
which students of any nationality may pursue their studies without the paymentof a 
single fee.’’ $ 
Johns Hopkins is not the only university in which fellowships are managed upon this 
liberal principle. A number of the fellowships in each of the following institutions, as 
our investigation discloses, are open to the candidacy of all graduates: Harvard, Prince- 
ton, Cornell, Bryn Mawr, and Clark University, whichis purely a post-graduate school. 
In his annual report on the graduate department for the year 1888-89 the secretary of. 
the academic council of Harvard University says: ‘There is no more effective method 
of increasing the number of resident graduate students than by founding fellowships 
open alike to graduates of Harvard and of other colleges.”’ 
Yale University owns six fellowships, all of which are limited to graduates of the 
university. Two of them are for the use of the theological department, and allow the 
holders to pursue their studies either at Yaleorin Europe or Palestine. ‘The income of 
these fellowships is $700 and $500, The remaining four fellowships are for the use of 
the graduate department, and the income from each is $600 perannum, Atleast oneof 
these four entitles the holder to pursue his studies abroad. 
The fellowships in the possession of Princeton are divided into two classes, viz: Uni- 
versity fellowships and college fellowships. The difference between these two classes 
is that the university fellowships are open to the graduates of any American college, 
and the appointments are made not by a competitive examination, but by a comparison 
of the records presented by the applicants as to their previous collegiate standing, ca- 
pacity, and character; whereas the college fellowships are open to graduates of Princes 
ton only. ‘The university fellowships are now four in number, the income of one being 
   
-P-A-G-E-724
      G52 a EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. 
$500 per annum and the income of the other three iin $400 each per annum. i'our 
of the college fellowships have an income of $600 each per annum, one of $400, one of 
$200, while the seventh, the biological fellowship, conveys the use of a table in the 
Nationa) Seaside Laboratory at Woods Holl, Mass., together with all the facilities af- 
forded for the collection and study of animal life during the season favorable for such 
investigations. In the winter months following this laboratory work the fellow pur- 
sues his studies at Princeton. 
The annual catalogue of Princeton for the year 1889-90 contains the following regu- 
lations concerning fellows: 
“Every fellow obtaining any one of the $600 fellowships must devote his whole time 
for one year to study in the department for which the fellowship is provided under the 
direction of the professors in that department. He must reside in Princeton, and pass 
two rigid examinations on his work, unless by a vote of the faculty he be allowed to 
study at an approved foreign university, in which case he shall from time to time fur- 
nish written reports of his work to the professors in his department.” 
All of the fellowships heretofore mentioned are open to men only. The eight fellow- 
ships owned by Cornell University are open to both men and women who have taken a 
baccalaureate degree at any college or university. The income is $400 each per annum. 
Holders of these fellowships must reside at the university. 
‘The trustees of Boston University established in 1889 two fellowships ‘‘ for the assist- 
ance of promising young men of positive Christian character in fitting themselves for 
the most advanced teaching in colleges and theological schools.’’ One of these fellow- 
ships is for the use of the School of Theology, the other for the College of Liberal Arts; 
the holders may remain in residence or pursue their studies abroad. The general 
statutes of the university upon fellowships are as follows: 
“All recipients of the above [higher] degrees from this university shall be eligible to 
the university fellowships, and each fellow shall be aided in the further prosecution of 
studies, especially in foreign universities, hospitals, and other institutions, to the amount 
of notless than $500 per annum for such periods as the statutes may allow. 
“Tn filling the professorships of the university fellows will be considered as preferred 
candidates.’” 
Haverford College, Pennsylvania, has received a sum of money for the purpose of es- 
tablishing four fellowships of the annual value of $300 each, the whole charge for board 
and tuition. By the conditions of the donors one of these will be g' given to a graduate 
of each of the following colleges, viz, Haverford, Penn, Earlham, and Wilmington. The 
holders must reside at Haverford. 
In April, 1889, the University of Michigan received $10,000 from Mrs. Catherine E. 
_ Jones, for the purpose of founding afellowship. The annual stipend of this fellowship 
may not exceed $500. Candidates must have resided at the university as students in 
the academic department at least three entire semesters prior to the appointment. 
The holder of the fellowship must make the Greek and Latin languages and litera- 
tures the special subjects of study. The period of incumbency is limited to two years, 
the first of which must be spent in residence at the university, while the second may, 
if the examining board should see fit, be spent at Athens, Rome, or some other place 
deemed by the board equally favorable to classical study. ‘The fellowship is open to 
both men and women, 
Amherst College, Massachusetts, offers a fellowship to the Senior class for excellence _ 
in history and the social and economic sciences. ‘Two hundred and fifty dollarsis to be 
awarded in 1891, and annually thereafter. 
Washington and Lee University, Virginia, has recently received asum of money yield- 
ing an income of $500 for the purpose of founding a fellowship. The following regula- 
tions concerning fellowships appear in the catalogue: of this university for the year 1889-90: 
“The design is to secure a more thoroughand extended scholarship than can be at- 
tained in the time usually allotted to academic instruction. 
‘‘The fellowships will be restricted to graduates of this university. 
“They will be conferred for two consecutive years, and are not to be relinquished in 
any case until the end of that term, except for sufficient reasons to be approved by the 
faculty. 
“The recipient of a fellowship shall reside in or near the university and pursue a 
special line of study looking to the degree of PH. D., under the supervision of the pro- 
fessor in the department he may select. 
“If required by the faculty, he shall give instruction in the university for not more 
than two hours a day. 
“‘He shall have access to the library, class-room instruction, and other privileges of 
the university, and shall receive a salary of $500, or whatever smaller sum may be 
yielded by the endowment of the fellowship to which he is appointed.’’ 
The board of trustees of the University of South Carolina recently established a fel-

lowship open only to graduates of the university proposing to pursue graduate studies. 
It may be held fora term of two years. A stated salary (not mentioned in the catalogue) 
is attached to this fellowship, The holder must be a graduate of the university, | 
‘The purpose of the fellowships in Vanderbilt University is shown in the following ex~ 
tract from the catalogue of that institution for the year 1889-90: e ; 
“*Tn order to encourage the prosecution of the highest branches of literary and scien- 
tific study, and to enable the university to become a center of scholarship and culture, 
/it is designed to found, as the means of the university may permit, a number of fellow- 
ships, affording to their incumbents residence, support, and facilities for the pursuit of 
general or special study.”? z 
The fellowships of this university are divided into two classes, viz, graduate and post- 
graduate. The graduate fellowships, three in number, are open to young men who have 
received one of the academic degrees of the university, and are recommended by the 
faculty. They are tenable for one year, but may be renewed for a second year, during 
which time the holders must pursue a course of post-graduate and nonprofessional study, 
and teach, not exceeding two hours daily. The income of each fellowship is $300 per 
annum. : 
The postgraduate fellowships, five in number, may be held by graduates in the post 
graduate degrees, or by graduates who have performed for two years the duties of a 
graduate fellowship. The income from each is $500 per annum. Incumbents are ex- 
pected to prosecute at the university special scientific or literary studies, and to teach, 
not exceeding two hours per day. 
The University of the City of New York offers two fellowships, amounting to $300 
each, to the two students completing the course in arts whose scholarship is the highest. 
They are open to men only, and the graduate studies must be pursued under the mem- 
bers of the faculty of the university. 
According to Mr. Dodge, fellow at Columbia College, the fellowships at that institu- 
tion are divided into three classes, viz, prize fellowships, tutorial fellowships, and hon- 
orary fellowships, the last of which have no money value. Their holders are, how- 
ever, expected to give certain instruction, receiving in return free tuition and such 
privileges as are accorded to the other fellows. In 1889-90 Columbia had eleven fel- 
Jowships in the school of arts, with an annual income of $500 each. Besides these, four 
fellowships of an annual value of $250 each are awarded at the discretion of the faculty to 
students of the third year in the School of Political Science, under the sole condition 
that the recipients be candidates for the degree of PH. D. The School of Mines has at 
its disposal the John Tyndall fellowship for the encouragement of scientific research. 
The income of this fellowship shall never be less than $648, and the holder shall be 
either a graduate or a student in some department of Columbia College, but not neces- 
sarily a candidate for a degree. According to the regulations governing this fellowship, 
the holder may pursue his studies at Columbia or at some other university in this coun- 
try or abroad. Appointments are made annually, but the holder is eligible to appoint- 
ment from yearto year. .The number of fellowships in the School of Mines during the 
year 1889-90 was nine, and the total number in the college was twenty-four. 
The Handbook of Information of Columbia College for the year 1890-91 mentions 
the establishment during the year 1889-90 of three new fellowships in the department 
of architecture. The value of one of the fellowships is $1,300 and the value of the others 
is $1,000 each. The fellowships are awarded every second year and the payments are 
made in four equal installments during the year in which the award is made. The 
money received by the holders of the fellowships ‘is to be devoted to foreign study and 
travel, in accordance with plans prepared by themselves and approved by the professor 
of architecture. Upon his return each must present a written report, and shall ex- 
hibit at the School of Mines the drawings he has made. These prizes are open to grad- 
uates of the department of architecture less than thirty years of age. 
After recommending the subdivision of classes into small sections for the purpose of 
individual instruetion, the late President Barnard thus sets forth the object of estab- 
lishing tutorial fellowships in Columbia College: 
‘‘Such subdivision necessarily involves, when made, an increase in the number of in- 
structors. In the department of mathematics a vacancy occurring at the close of the 
year 1883-84 afforded an opportunity of adding, without an increase of expense, one to 
the number of mathematical teachers, by the appointment of two fellows with tutorial 
duties instead of simply filling the vacancy by the appointment of an officer of the same 
grade as that of the officer retiring. This opportunity was improved, and the advantage 
of the measure has been sensibly felt during the year now closing. * * * 
“The adoption of a policy of this kind has an advantage additional to that on account 
of which it wus originally recommended, viz, that of increasing the liability of the stu- 
dent to be held to a personal performance at every exercise; which is that it offers op- 
portunities to graduates of the college to continue their studies without expense to them- 
selves after graduation, with a view to qualify themselves for original work in science |

A fellowship association consisting of alumni, former students, andother friends of 
the University of Minnesota, ' was incorporated March 10, 188%. Its object is to en- 
courage graduate students in special lines of study and for, that purpose to raise afund by 
endowment, gift, grant, bequest, or annual contributions of its members. Thus far tliree 
fellowships of the annual value of $250 each have been established. 
Eight fellowships of the annual value of $400 each have been recently established by 
the board of regents of the University of Wisconsin ‘‘for the purpose of promoting higher 
scholarship and more extended original study than the academic courses afford.’? Ap- 
pointees to these fellowships are selected each year from members of the graduating 
class of that year, but at the end of that term they may be reélected for a second year. 
Another fellowship of $400 per annum has been established by the Hon. John Johnston, 
of Milwaukee. In the appointment of holders ‘to this fellowship preference will be 
given to excellence and promise in the department of mechanic arts, and to residents of 
Milwaukee County. All holders of fellowships must reside at the university, and those 
‘holding the fellowships established by the regents must teach one hour daily or super- 
vise laboratory work two hours a day. The fellowships are open to both men and © 
women, 
Of the colleges for women, Bryn Mawr College, Pennsylvania, is the only one that 
has been provided with fellowships. This institution has six of these foundations, one 
‘of which has an income of $500 per annum, applicable to the expenses of one year’s 
“study and residence at some foreign university, English or continental; it is open to 
graduates of Bryn Mawr or any other college of good | standing. The other five fellow- 
ships entitle the holders to free tuition, a ftirnished room in the college building, and 
the sum of $350 yearly. 
The following table presents in a condensed form the number of fellowships owned 
by each institution hereinbefore mentioned, and the aggregate income derived therefrom:

In addition to the institutions here mentioned the Association of Collegiate Alumnze 
proposes to devote $5U0 every year towards paying the expenses of some young woman 
who wishes to carry.on her studiesina foreign country. The candidate must beagradu- 
ate of a college belonging to the association, and in order to be appointed to the fellow- 
ship must. give promise of actual distinction in the subject to which she is devoting 
herself. The fellowship is bestowed upon evidence of the candidaté’s ability, and of 
ler prospect of success in her chosen line of stady. A committee of seven members 
aas been appointed to determine the award and to regulate the period of incumbency, 
which is generally one year. 
Taking the records of the two institutions, Johns Hopkins University and Harvard 
University, the former of which publishes a full list with the occupations, present and 
past, of its former fellows, and the latter a condensed record of the men who have held 
the traveling fellowships, we can form some idea of the influence which the continued 
- founding of feliowships will have upon the teaching force of our colleges and universi- 
ties. This influence will not be felt to any considerable extent until the number of fel- 
lowships shall have been considerably increased, for as yet the number is exceedingly 
small when compared with the number of colleges and universities in our country whose 
teaching force in 1888-89 numbered 5,422, excluding professional departments.

SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS. 
I.—HINTs AND SUGGESTIONS FOR THE INTRODUCTION AND PRACTICAL WoRKING 
or THE ScHooL SAVINGS BANK SysrEM.! ‘ 
Acting upon the solicitation of a few educators of our State and with a view to throw- 
ing a little more light upon the question of school savings banks, which seems to have 
impressed favorably a large number of teachers, the writer will endeavor to give a few 
words about that adjunct to the education of children. 
A visit to the twelve schools of Long Island City, N. Y., will convince any one that 
the system has come to stay. Let us illustrate: The number of pupils on register is 
7,000, of which 3,219 are depositors having to date to their credit in the Long Island 
City Savings Bank $20,558.31. : 
THE ADVANTAGES OF PRACTICAL LESSONS OF THRIFT IN THE SCHOOLS. 
During the five years the system has been in practice in the above schools, we have 
remarked: " 
1. That on Monday, the day of the collection of the savings, there are fewer cases of 
tardiness and absence, and that a more cheerful disposition exists among pupils and 
teachers—a great incentive for future good work. School savings banks act also asa \ 
moral discipline by making the school rooms more attractive for dull children and gen- 
erate in them a taste to be charitable, as exemplified by their action in June, 1889, in 
voluntarily subscribing $452.37 from their penny savings to alleviate the sufferings of 
their brother and sister scholars of the Conemaugh Valley who lost their parents and 
homes in the calamity of Johnstown. 
2. That school savings banks pay larger dividends on asmaller investment of time and 
labor than any other school exercise. 
8. That since the introduction of the system in’ the schools of Long Island City and 
elsewhere, the public in general has taken more interest in school affairs, the parents 
become acquainted with the teachers and they are more appreciated by the authorities. 
Many of them have had their salaries increased in consideration thereof. 5 
4. That it creates good habits of self restraint for unnecessary things which take per- 
manent root and exclude those of a baser sort. 
5. That it offers to the pupils an ennobling influence, and thatit has already helped 
a great many of our boys and girls of the classes of 1884, 85, and 86 to overcome diffi- 
culties, achieve success, and secure victory in thé sphere they have chosen to pursue 
after leaving school to secure a place in the world’s movement. 
6. That our children better appreciate the value of their pennies, and the best means 
for their wise use. ‘That they learn earlier to compute and keep accounts. 
7. That less orange and banana peels and peanut shells are to be seen around the 
schoolhouses, fewer books stained with candy and pastries, that the pennies which in 
the past years were spent for such indulgence are to-day saved and are waiting a more 
profitable investment. e 
8. That the teachers themselves have profited as well as their pupils by the innova- 
tion, and that they are as enthusiastic as the scholars about its working and would not 
depart from it. 
9, That if we should succeed in introducing the system in the schools of America, = 
progressive step toward the betterment of school, home, social, and public life would —

  656 EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89, 
be made and a grateful public would recognize those who have helped in that ae 
work, 
10. That the spirit of the system is nothing more than an educational adjunct tenned. 
in a practical direction, and therefore to attempt to excite the educational spirit without 
the codperation of the teacher and parent is labor lost. 
11. That where school savings banks are introduced they awaken a genuine regard for 
the public schools and at the same time open a new page in the educational affairs of 
_our country. 
12. That school savings banks present a nationalinterest asa social as wellas an educa- 
tional progress, as they educate the children to a harmonious developmentof many of the 
faculties which transform them from little spendthrifts into little savers and teach them 
to see their independence floating upon the horizon of their future career. 
13, That many of our little depositors have already been awakened to a sense of de- 
light by the rousing of dormant powers and the developing of unsuspected resources in 
themselves, 
14. That a pleasing feature of the banking plan—one that was not contemplated by 
its friends—is the desire expressed by the parents of some children too young to enter 
school to become beneficiaries of its advantages. Who can question the pleasure it will 
afford these little ones to have their names enrolled upon the school register as scholars. 
15. That to neglect or discourage the training of a boy or girl to active usefulness is to 
Jand him or her in future misery, consequently it is considered that the most sacred 
duty of every good citizen is to protect the child from any association or influence that 
tends to demoralize life. 
16. That money in the hands of children is a very treacherous weapon. In a great 
number of cases it has served to buy the seed of vice, and has brought many of our young 
people to the first step of the ladder of crime and pauperism, whereas had they re- 
ceived the lessons of thrift and economy on the schoo] bench they would have been able 
to enjoy life with its golden promises and rewards. 
FRIVOLOUS OBJECTIONS TO THE SYSTEM OF SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS, 
To the objections that school savings banks entail too much labor and responsibility 
upon the teachers, a few words may serve as answer: Labor? Fifteen minutes every 
week, on Monday morning (9 to 9:15) from which we must deduct about eight minutes 
allotted to calling the roll, leaving seven minutes extra for collecting the savings of a 
class of fifty pupils. 
Responsibility? None. At 9:15 each teacher will send in an envelope (as prescribed 
by the rules and regulations) to her principal the amount collected without any detail. 
At 9:30 the principal is prepared to send to the savings bank, by the janitor, the money 
in-gross, received from the teachers, also without any detail, but to be set down in a 
regular bank book in his name for the school. At the end of the month, fifteen min- 
utes extra for teachers and thirty for the account of the principal is all the time required. 
The principal deposits the money but can not withdraw it. The writer may add right 
here, that it has never been reported to him during the past five years in which he has 
been interested in the scheme’ that any teacher has objected to or complained of being 
the temporary recipient of the savings of his or her scholars. An evidence to this fact 
is, that of all the schools that have adopted the banking system not one, as far as I 
, know, has relaxed its interest of the undertaking, a proof that the spark kindled five 
years ago in the public schools of Long Island City stiil maintains it vitality, and there 
ig no reason why this spark should not be kindled in all the schools of our country, for 
the motives given in previous pages. 
Apropos of the clerical work which the system entails on the savings bank that re- 
ceives the deposits of the schools of Long Island City, it may be said here, that in a re- 
cent visit to that institution, Mr. H. Smedley, its secretary, expressed his views upon 
the system of school savings banks in connection with the bank as follows: 
‘*While it increases the labor materially in making the cost of each account out of 
relative proportion, still the trustees felt that the idea was philanthropic and deserved 
every encouragement. It seems to have awakened in the minds of the people of modest 
means, as well as the working class, a sense of thrift and economy which otherwise 
‘would have been unknown. Many profitable enterprises owe their origin to the system; 
even’ more than that, many mindful citizens have learned from the children the road 
and the advantages of the savings banks.’? The above words could be corroborated by 
a great many members of school boards who have visited the schools q aed the savings 
banks of Long Island City, with the view of assuring themselves that the innovation is 
worth what is claimed for it. Their verdict upon the merits of the system are best ex- 
pressed in the action taken by them afterwards, and by the results which will follow in 
the near future.   
-P-A-G-E-729

SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS. Ds 657 
Mostof the doubts expressed upon the merits of the system have their origin in igno- 
rance of the rules and regulations governing the practical working of the plan. ‘The 
best way to test it would be to try it in one public school; see the results and if they 
are found to be satisfactory then go ahead. 
PRELIMINARY INFORMATION FOR THE PRACTICAL INTRODUCTION OF THE SYSTEM, 
The practical working of the plan and printed forms adopted in the schools of Long 
Island City since 1885 are, and have been considered the shortest, the simplest, and 
the most effective in every respect that could be devised as regards labor in the schoolroom 
and clerical work in the savings bank, The recent improvements as indicated in this 
new edition offer an additional claim to the preference of the present method. As the 
system of school savings banks has lately attracted the attention of the educational 
world, the press, philanthropists, economists, and even legislators, it is important that 
a uniform plan, one which has matured under the supervision of a specialist, should 
receive a general indorsement and become universally adopted. 
Future educators, having at heart the progress of this undertaking, will perhaps, — 
through their larger experience, find other needed improvements, and thus be able to 
give new impulse to the cause, but at present the plan which has been adopted by 
832 school banks out of 1,065 now in operation in the United States has given general 
satisfaction and is doubtless the most serviceable. ‘‘ Method is the arithmetic of suc- 
cess.” 
If the system is to be introduced at all, it ought to enter in our schoolroomsas an edu: 
cational factor, and not as a purely capitalistic idea. It must become part of the ordi- 
nary programme of school work, disturbing no other element of the work, gaining a 
strong foothold by its merit./ It is for the above reasons that (1) deposits of the scholars 
should be recorded in the roll book, thus coming into accord with the other studies on 
the programme; that is to say, a teacher does not need another book for recording the 
deposits. (2) That Monday (at the beginning of the morning session) is the day on 
which the savings of the scholars should be collected. (3) That the money be deposited 
the same day, by the principal or the superintendent, in a savings bank or sound trust 
company, and insuch a manner as to enable the depositor to withdraw a part or all of his 
money at any time. 
STEPS TO BE TAKEN PREVIOUS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE SYSTEM, 
   1. School boards do not require authorization of the State or nation to enable them to 
introduce the banking feature in their schools. They are invested with the power to 
introduce it. If the teacher, principal, or the superintendent is the first mover in the 
cause, he must apply for authority to the school board. 
2. After receiving the authorization, the superintendent or the principal should en- 
deayor to secure the codperation of a savings bank near the school which will receive the 
weekly savings of the scholars, arrange matters regarding the hour for deposits, and de- 
cide the question of blank forms, also by whom the cost of their printing should be sup- 
rted, ete. 
. Having received the necessary authorization and having fixed the date of the first 
day of the collection of the savings of the scholars, the school board, the superintendent, 
or even the principal should issue, a few days previous to the starting, a circular 
addressed to the parents, the press, and the friends of the schools, - 
4. This circular ought to contain: (1) The reasons which prompted the board to intro 
duce the system. (2) Giving the date of the day that the system will be put in oper- 
ation. (3) Soliciting the earnest coperation of the teachers, parents, the local press, 
and the friends of the children and the schools, (4) Giving a sketch of the rules and 
regulations for the successful working of the plan, and sending with that circular a 
copy of the weekly deposit card (as sample No. 1, page 661-2). Such card to be returned 
to the teacher by the scholar the day of collection. 
Money deposited in the school fund by the scholars ought not to be the object of a 
drain upon the resources of the parents. We seek rather a sound and healthy growth 
of the system than the accumulation of large amounts of money; for the success of 
banks is measured more particularly by the large number of depositors than by the large 
amount of money collected. 
5. In that circular we ought to strongly impress parents with the idea that school banks 
shall never beallowed to become savings banks for adults. To allow this would be to 
deprive the child depositor of the intended educational value of schocl hanks and would 
paralyze the child’s interest in the weekly banking exercises,    
-P-A-G-E-730
    
      : { im 
658 j EDUCATION REPORT, 1888-89. i j 
6. The money that a child deposits must be the product of his own labor or a Feaott him 
from a right cause. 
7. The circular ought to inform the teachers and the public in general that school 
savings banks managed by wise leaders will become a most salutary agency in education. 
Its main object is to encourage the love of labor and to make a good use of its rewards. 
This is best encouraged by a proper love of money, which is powerful for good, if con- 
acientiously used. 
8, On the Friday previous to the depositing day thesuperintendent or the principal may 
- prepare a brief address to the pupils at the closing exercises, which should embody the 
advantages and benefits derived from the practical lessons of thrift and economy and the 
dangers resulting from investing their pocket money fora great many unnecessary things. 
He should then inform the scholars that their teachers will be prepared the following 
Monday to receive all the sums from one penny to one dollar, and that these sums will te 
deposited the same day in the local sayings bank in the name of each depositor, who will 
receive a regular bank book when his deposits shall have reached a dollar or above. 
After dismissing the school the same day, the superintendent or the principal will call 
a meeting of all teachers under his supervision. He will inform them of the steps al- 
ready taken for the introduction of the system, and will convert that gathering into a 
drill class, in which he will fill the réle of teacher, and they the réle of pupils. Hav- 
ing a set of all the blank forms adopted, he may explain their use and purpose, and teach 
them in fifteen minutes more than they could learn in one month’s practice. 
He ought to impress upon them that the system, directed by willing teachers, can not 
fail to be successful, and that by conducting the transactions of that system with punc- 
tuality and regularity the teachers will foster a habit in the pupils of being regular and 
punctual in all their acts. In this special school exercise, as in any other regularschool 
work, the example of the teachers will bear a healthy influence on the scholars. ‘‘ The 
best and most important part of every man’s education is that which he gives himself.” 
(J. H. Smedley.) Any common-sense teacher who can husband his or her pecuniary 
resources, and who is able to save a little for future emergency, has the qualifications 
sufficient to give to his or her class, when the opportunity is afforded, some useful in- 
formation, hints, and.suggestions to carry on successfully this new branch of education, 
which is not the least important on the class programme. 
The teacher who has at heart the success of this undertaking will not blush to head 
the list of his or her pupils by his or her weekly savings, which will prove a great in- 
centive to the pupils and a very available friend to rely on at the closing of the school 
to cover expenses of the summer vacation. 
With these preliminary informations disposed of, let us step into a class room on 
Monday morning after the bell has called the scholars to order. At precisely 9 a. m., 
the time which was formerly the signal to open the schoolbook, prepare the slate, etc., 
that day and hour everything commences with the collection of the money that the 
children have saved, which they now entrust to the care of the teacher, who marks it 
next to their names on the roll. 
REGULATIONS, 
In calling a name, the child must say if he has anything to deposit: ‘‘ Yes, one cent,”” 
or, ‘‘yes, five cents,’? or whatever sum he has. He must immediately arise from his 
seat and deliver his money with his weekly card (see specimen No. 1, pp. 661-2) to the 
teacher, who counts the money and inscribes the amount in the Monday column of the 
roll book, and upon the weekly card upon whick the name of the pupil, the teacher, 
and amount of previous deposits are inscribed. 
In calling the roll, if nothing has been saved, the scholar must answer ‘‘no,’’ and 
the teacher makes a mark to that effect, at the same time marking the attendance. 
When the teacher has concluded calling the roll and collecting the savings, she or he 
counts the money collected in the class to see if the amount corresponds with the total 
amount inscribed in the roll book. If the amounts tally, the money is immediately 
sent to the principal in a sealed envelope (specimen 5, page 664). 
This ends the teacher’s work, except that, with the collection of the last Monday of 
each month, he or she will send to the principal on this same day a list (specimen No. 
2, page 662) of all the depositors of the class, with name and amount, to be credited in 
- the savings bafik to each depositor who has contributed to the school fund fifty cents 
and above during the month, Sums less than fifty cents, although kept in the bank 
to the credit of the principal, will be credited to the ‘‘general fund’’ until the scholar 
has reached the sum fixed, Thenit will credited to the scholar’s account. 
As to the principal: He receives immediately after collection, in a sealed envelope, 
the amount collected by each of the teachers separately; he does not require a special 
book; the printed form (specimen No. 2) and receiyed at the end of each month from 
his or her teacher is sent to the bank with the bank books of the pupils who have 
   
-P-A-G-E-731
  SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS. 659 
contributed fifty cents and above. That same list is returned the week after, from 
the bank to the principal, with the bank books of the pupils inscribed in the list No. 
2, cited above. So, these monthly lists in his possession take the place of a special 
book. But, if he desires to keep a separate book to inscribe the weekly deposits of his 
or her teachers, the specimen No. 6, page 664, is well calculated to meet that need, and 
to save expenses can be easily made by hand, As for details of the weekly deposits 
by individual pupils, if he needs them, he cansecure them by borrowing the roll books 
of the teachers. These roll books are the property of the school, and as such are pre-- 
served by the authorities as official records are. 
At the first general deposit of the money of a school, sent to the bank by the princi- 
pal, he receives in return a bank book in which is recorded the total amount deposited 
by all his teachers. When money is deposited, a bank ticket (specimen No. 3, page —) 
must accompany each weekly deposit to the bank. This ticket No. 3 is also used by 
the teacher in connection with the deposit.list No. 2 at the end of each month by in- 
scribing thereon the number of bank book, amount to be deposited, and name of pupils, 
and sending it with the pass books to the bank. 
Though the bank books of the scholars are sent to the bank once every three months 
for balancing, the principal need not send to the bank the pass book of a child who has 
not deposited fifty cents and above during the pastthree months, At their request, the 
principal will allow the little depositors to take their bank books home once a month, 
say on Friday, to be returned the following Monday. At vacation, or when a pupil 
leaves school, the bank book will be surrendered to the child, who may deposit or with- 
draw money directly from the bank, the cashier acting during the vacation for the prin- 
cipal. 
Mat the reopening of the school: the principal will request the cashier of the bank to 
furnish him a list of the school banking operations performed during the vacation, and 
will inscribe upon his own journal the amount deposited or withdrawn by each pupil 
during the above vacation. 
With the view of reducing the clerical work in the bank and atthe same timeremedy- 
ing the inconvenience caused by some depositors living far from the sayings banks, 
the superintendent or the principal may receive on Monday morning, day of collection, 
the applications to withdraw part or all the money in the bank of scholar depositors. 
The superintendent or the principal will pay the checks presented with some of the money 
already collected that day, and willsend such receipted checks (seeform No. 4, page —) 
to the bank with the collection of theday. Theamount ofthese checks will be received 
at the bank as cash and entered in the account of the principal or superintendent, and 
charged to the individual account of the depositors interested. 
The superintendent or the principal, acting as the de facto treasurer of the school, 
should render, at the end of each school term to the board of education, atits regular meet- ing, an account of all the banking transactions in his school during the term ending, 
stating the work done, number of depositors, amount deposited, withdrawn, and re- 
maining due depositors, followed by remarks upon the advantages or the incon- venience offered by that system from observations taken during the last school term. 
THE PART SAVINGS BANKS PLAY IN SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS. 
Now that we have described the details for the introduction of the school savings 
bank system, let us step into a savings bank which has arranged to receive the deposits 
of the scholars. Savings banks are regarded as benevolent institutions. Their object is to receive the savings of the working people and invest the same for them and make 
these savings earn money as well as labor does. The doorsof savings banks are open to the people of all ages, color, and nationalities, and the healthful influence in the com- munity is extended even to minors. In many cities and towns of our country, the say- ings banks have opened their doors to 20,974 pupils of 158 schools of America, and they have already received in deposits during the lastfew years $97,816.73 by the intermedi- ary of teachers who act as their trustees in a certain measure. 
The moral influence derived from the gleaning of so many pennies, which previously were spent for unnecessary things often injurious to body, mind, and soul, is enough to make all those who are willing to see the future citizen more industrious, law abid- ing, and useful to himself and to the State, rejoice and assist in carrying on the good work. 
Drop into.a bank on a Monday forenoon, which is lending a helping hand to this new juvenile and economic educator, and you will see enter a school janitor with a smile upon his face, and a box or a parcel under his arm, which contains the collection of the pennies saved during the previous week by the pupils of a school. The contents of these boxes and parcels contain many silent stories, It is a sowing of the seed which will produce a hopeful harvest,

THE LEGISLATION OF SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS IN CONNECTION WITH THE BANKS 
WHICH ARE WILLING TO RECEIVE THE DEPOSITS OF THE SCHOLARS. 
» When the trustees of a savings bank have offered their codperation to the school au- 
i{horities to receive the deposits of the scholars by the intermediary of the superin- 
tendent or the principal of the school, it is advisable: 
1, That the bank have a special ledger to record the scholar deposits, providing the 
number. of depositors will amount to 500 and above. 
2. That the bank give to each of the superintendents or principals sending the 
weekly:collections to the bank, a separate bank book. The superintendent or principal 
will fill out a deposit slip (as sample No. 3, page 663) for the amount received from his 
school each Monday morning, then send the money together with his book and slip to 
the bank. The amount will be placed to his credit. 
The scholars having contributed one dollar are entitled to receive each a bank book, 
aad as such, his future account in the bank will be treated the same as any individual 
account. The monthly list (sample No. 2, page 662) drawn by the teacher and sent to 
the principal with the collection of the last Monday of each month wiil include all the 
names of the several scholars with amounts which they are to be credited with. The 
list of all the teachers of a school will be sent.to the bank by the principal. It is from 
these lists that the cashier of the bank will enter on each pupil’s pass-book and on the 
bank’s ledger the amount to be credited on the pupil’s pass-book, 
The total monthly amount of the several lists of the same school will be deducted 
from the principal’s pass-book and charged on the bank’s ledger to the superintendent 
or principal’s account, they giving a check for the same. 
The above manner of transacting school banking affairs has been in operation in a 
great many schools and banks the past few years with success, but by way of reducing 
the clerical work in the banks, it is advisable that a bank having 2,000 scholar deposi- 
tors and above, their weekly deposits should be allowed to accumulate and the transfer 
to the pupil’s pass-book take place only at the end of every quarter. . This question is 
left to the judgment of the school and bank authorities as also the one relating to the 
interest to be allowed toscholar depositors. In most of the post-office savings banks in 
_ Europe no interest is allowed to individual depositors for sums less than five dollars, nor 
for a period less than a month. The average rate of interest is 2} per cent: 
the savings banks do not allow interest to depositors. 
In concluding the above remarks relating to school savings bank legislation the writer 
may add that he has run slightly over the most vital points, but, of course, some of its 
minor details will be always left to the judgment of school and bank authorities and to 
the discretion of superintendents and principals. i? 
The rules laid down here for the limitation of weekly deposits, as well as the amount 
fixed entitling a pupil to receive the regular bank book, may be altered so as to make 
them compatible with some local peculiarities.. But under any circumstance the time 
fixed to receive the savings of the scholars can not be changed, viz, precisely at 9 o’clock 
every Monday morning at the opening of the morning session; if it should be decided 
to have the collection of the savings taken outside of school time, or even to allow an 
officer of the local: savings bank to interfere in the schoolrooms with the collections, 
better not to introduce the system, for it would be unfair to overtax the teacher, and at 
the same time deprive the scholars of their recreation time. 
School: banking being considered as an important factor in education must be prac- 
ticed under the supervision of the teacher and in conjunction with the other school 
work... The presence in the school of an agent of the bank to collect the savings of the 
children would rob them of the educative value expected. 
Though the writer did not intend at first to indulge in criticism, nor in laudation, he 
considers as a matter of justice and fairness to acknowledge before all the friends and 
advocates of school savings banks that from 158 schools of 34 cities of 7 different States 
of the Union which have adopted the system, none has shown more enthusiasm for the 
cause than the school boards, the superintendents, principals, and teachers of the 48 
publie’schools of 9 cities of the State of Pennsylvania, who have inaugurated the sys- 
tem since December 30, 1889, in less than a year. The codperation and liberality of 
the officials of the banks in that State is also unprecedented.

A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE BLANK FORMS ADOPTED. 
~ Ont of 1,065 school banks now in practical operation in schools of the United States, 
532 are using the blank forms which we describe in the following pages. These forms 
have been considered by the most competent judges superior to those now in use in 
Europe, The 216 school banks in 48 schools of the State of Pennsylyania have also

will receive un official recognition, because they seem to cover all the ground for the prac- 
tical working of the plan.

NINE SYSTEMS OF TEACHING ECONOMY TO THE YOUNG AMERICAN. 
  21.83 
    
1. The school savings-banix system as in operation in Long Island City, the basis of 
‘this pamphlet, will probably survive all others, and has, in fact, furnished the ground- 
work for the other systems now in vogue. 
2. In 1886 the Provident Savings Bank of Baltimore was incorporated by the legisla- 
ture of Maryland. The directors have adopted’ the stamp-deposit system which is yet 
in use in a few benevolent societies and Sunday schools of England and Germany. The 
lowest deposit is 10 cents. The deposit stamps are of the denomination of 10, 15, and 
25 cents. One dollar of stamp deposit entitles the investor toa bank book; $3 bears 
interest. The writer may venture to say here that if the board of education had agreed. 
to introduce into their schools the school savings-bank plan, as has been proposed, and 
if the local savings banks had not refused their codperation the directors of that insti- 
tution might also have adopted the Long Island City plan. However, the stamp-saving 
plan has proven to be a success. 
3. 1887. In the Pennsylvania School Journal for April, 1890, a description is given of 
a new system in practice in the schools of Pottsville, Pa., due to the genius of its princi- 
pal, Prof.S.A.Thurlow. This system, though valuable in principle, could not conveniently 
be adopted in all localities, In many respects that system is built upon the same plans 
which regulate the transactions of the building loan associations. The eighty-eight 
scholar depositors (April, 1890) are stockholders. From the date of the organization, 
1887, to April last the sum of $1,500 has been invested in stocks and deposits. Cer- 
tainly such asystem has some advantages if the school time allotted for intellectual cul- 
ture or recreation is not impaired by the transactions of that association. Though the 
originator of that plan deserves public recognition for his endeavors in the cause of edu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-737
  SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS, 665 
cation, yet that system has objectionable features, for the consideration of which the 
writer asks to be excused for want of space. 
4. November, 1888. The Penny Provident Fund of New York, was inaugurated No- 
vember 15, 1888, by the Charity Organization Society. The Baltimore system was 
adopted. The deposit stamps are of the denomination of 1, 3, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents. That 
society has 75 branch stations in New York. Up to July 1, 1890, $7,014 remained on 
deposit and there were 15,000 depositors. Three-dollar stamps entitle the depositors te 
their fall value in cash, which he can deposit in any savings bank of his choice. 
5, June, 1890, Detroit, Mich. Began the stamp-saving system also upon the plan in 
practice in Baltimore. Its introduction is due to the efforts of Mr. Edwin F. Mack, 
cashier of the People’s Savings Bank, and under the management and supervision of 
that bank. One-dollar deposits and above draws interest. The following papers com- 
mend the system: The Detroit Free Press of September 13, and November 2, 1890; the 
Sunday Herald of Boston, October 5, and the Philadelphia Press of October 10, 1890, 
6. October, 1890, An association called the ‘‘Stamp Saving Society,’? composed of a 
few prominent citizens of Boston, has introduced (October 15), in that city, the stamp- 
saving system upon the plan in practice in New York. (See American Banker, October 
16, 1890, and Philadelphia Press of October 10.) No interest is allowed on sums less 
than three dollars, 
7. October, 1890. Mr. J. Butler, cashier of the People’s Savings Bank of West Bay : 
City, Mich., introduced the Baltimore system of stamp savings in his city. (See Ameri- 
can Banker, October 4, 1890.) 
8. In the School Bulletin of Syracuse, for October, its genial editor, Mr. C. W. Bar- 
deen, informs his readers that in his next number (November) he will give the text of 
the interesting pamphlet of Prof. John McMullen on ‘‘School Money.’”? Mr. Me- 
Mullen describes a school bank established some time ago in his school, where four of 
the oldest boys were appointed president. cashier, etc. Paper money was used asa 
medium for the transaction of business among the scholars. The merit of that system 
consists in its originality and the perusal of that pamphlet could not but give genuiue 
pleasure on account of the pleasant and witty way in which he has described the method. 
9. Pratt Institute, Thrift Association, Brooklyn, N. Y. The popularity of that in- 
stitution does not need description. It is sufficient to say that there the young people’s 
instruction is based on an appreciation of the dignity as well as the value of intelligent 
handicraft and skilled labor. It endeavors to-give opportunity for complete and har- 
monious education, in the embodiment of which the inculcation of the habit of thrift 
and self-reliance is one of its valuable features. As the majority of the pupils of the 
institution are ready, in leaving the institution, to enter in the world’s activities, a sys- 
tem has been devised to meet the need, and one higher in character than the one used 
in the public schools. Below is a sammary sketch of the practical working of that 
system: 
In the early part of 1889 nine prominent and responsible business men who have 
proven their ability to successfully manage large enterprises, formed the Thrift Associa- 
tion. The aim of the association is to aid in the work carried on at the institute, but 
it is not conducted by the institute nor-responsible for its financial transactions, though 
the firm of Charles Pratt & Co. have executed a bond in the sum of $500,000 to in- 
demnify and protect all persons having financial relations with the Thrift Association. 
The object of the association is to promote habits of thritt to help people, especially 
the young, to become prudent and wise in the use of money and time. 
The plan adopted has much of the feature of that of the building and loan associ- 
ations, with the exception that it offers more security for depositors; The investing 
shares of the association, to which no liability attaches, are $150, payable at the rate 
of $1 per month for ten years, The monthly payments on each share amount in ten 
years to $120, and the accumulated interest at the rate of 5 per cent. per annum to $30, 
making $150 in all, in addition to which, provided the installments are regularly paid, 
each share, at the end of ten years, will be entitled toa premium of $10 more. In 
other words a monthly payment of $1 will amount, with interest and premium, to 
$160 at the end of ten years, or about 6 per cent. per annum on the subscription paid to 
the association; $150 in one sum pays up a share in full, and when this payment has 
been made the interest is payable half-yearly at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, the 
holder being entitled, at the end of ten years, to the same premium as that received by 
persons who pay for their shares by installments. The shares can be withdrawn at any 
time. Shares may be held by minors and any person, whether connected with Pratt Institute or not, is entitled to the benefit of the association. They contemplate the in- 
troduction of stamp savings for young scholars. ’ 
Those who are interested in the welfare of the rising generation may watch with in- terestand profit the progress of such an association with the view of extending the bene efits to other institutions.

666 EDUCATION, REPORT, 1888-89, 
STATISTICS OF THE SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS IN EUROPE, 
An accurate table of the operations of school savings banks in Europe would have 
proved a valuable adjunct to this contribution, but the writer will give below what he 
has been able to reach: 
Italy.—Statistics to December 31, 1888, from official report of 1889: 5,401 post-office 
savings banks; 87,764 depositors; due to them, $92,939.41. 
Belgium.—Statistics to December 31, 1889, from official report of 1890: 5,259 school 
savings banks; 212,037 depositors; due to them, $78,213.42. 
France.—Statistics to December, 1887, from official report of 1888: 23,375 school sav- 
ings banks; 161,387 depositors; due to them, $2,421,229.62. 
Liverpool,—Statistics to November, 1888, from official report of November 20, 1889: 
75 post-office savings-bank branches; 8,710 depositors; due to them, $7,721. 
Hungary and Germany.—School savings banks are entirely in the hands of private as- 
sociations, and statistics could not be conveniently got. 
Russia, Switzerland, Netherlands, England and her colonies.—As the annual report of 
the postmaster-general of these countries does not contain a column separate for the 
~ money of the schools, it became impossible to give the statistics of school savings banks,

    SCHOOL SAVINGS BANKS. 669 
IL.—TueE BRooKLINe (MAss.) System. 
Ina communication to the Bureau under date of April 10, 1890, Mrs. Edith Cabot 
describes the Brookline system of penny savings as follows: 
408 * “Our experience has been short, as we only began the work in January, but 
thus far the results have been most encouraging. 
‘*A¢ first the teachers were doubtful about it, though with one exception they wereall 
willing to give the necessary time and thought to it, showing themselves, as teachers 
almost always do, thoroughly unselfish in thematter. Now even the one who held back 
is convinced, for the savings in her room have become large and regular. 
‘‘We made oursystemas simple as possible. The teacherin each room collects the swv- 
ings in that room and records them for each child on a large card containing the names 
of all thechildren in her room, and also on small cards belonging to each child, which 
the child keeps and carries home. The under teacher deposits the money at once with 
the head teacher of the building, who gets a receipt for the amount. The head teacher 
deposits weekly in the savings bank. Where it is inconvenient for the head teacher to 
take charge of the money, inconsequence of distance from the bank or her living out 
of town, a lady is appointed trustee for that school and takes the money every week 
trom the head teacher, giving a receipt. As soon as any child has accumulated $2 he 
isadvised to open a bank book of his own. In that case either his own father or mother 
or the trustee of the school becomes trustee for him. 
“*We have already a large number of bank books opened for the children. It hasnot 
required as much of the teachers’ time as we feared. I have inquired of a considerable 
number and find the average time required for the whole business twenty minutes. We 
collect always and in ail the schools on Tuesday, as Monday is pay day in Brookline. 
The teachers attend to it as soon as the school opens, or sometimes in the few minutes 
before school, This is left to their preference, the committee only fixing the day and 
requesting that it be done early. 
““We feared that the children would be anxious to draw their money out almost as 
soon as they had put it in, and asked the teachers to use their influence against that. 
The result is that, I believe, none has yet been drawn out, except where a child was 
leaving town. The amount collected has been much larger than we expected. In the 
school of which I am trustee, where there is an average of 142 children, I have collected 
$42.54 up to this time, beginning January 14. These children are all Irish and their 
fathers workingmen, most of them day laborers. The difficulty that you speak of, that 
the children do not earn the money, is an obvious one, but on the other hand they have 
the money, and use it for candy, cakes, etc. Itis surely better to teach them to use it. 
The mere saving teaches them forethought and self-control and involves a good deal of 
care. ‘ 
“We find that they no longer need to be reminded that Tuesday is approaching, and 
the teachers carefully avoid it, and without dimiaution in the amount collected.. I 
find that in this town the parents are much in the habit of paying their children for 
little services rendered to themselves, and this money is now brought to the penny 
savings instead of going to the candy shop. Of course this is an unsatisfactory method 
on the part of the parents, but I am sorry to say it is not confined to the poor, and cer- © 
tainly not brought about by the penny savings. 
‘Tt was suggested thatsome of the children might be dishonest and would not deposit 
with the teacher all that was given him for the purpose by his parent. I have only 
known of one such case, and that was brought to light at once by the sending home of 
the child’s card. The parent detected the discrepancy, but did not suspect the teacher 
in the least, and it resulted in an excellent lesson for the child. * * * 
“Our plan was founded on what I could learn of the French, Flemish, and Scotch 
system. I am quite sure that thus far it has done well for the parents as well as the 
children. Many of them will save for their children when they would not for them- 
selves, and we reach in this way a good deal of money that’ would be wasted in little 
driblets which come to nothing, a fruitful source of want among the poor.”?

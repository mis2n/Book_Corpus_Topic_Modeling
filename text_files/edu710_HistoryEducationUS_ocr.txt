PREFACE 
In presenting this volume under the dignified title 
of A History of Education in the United States, 1 
fully recognize that I may to many seem presump- 
tuous. “Is our educational story,” they will say, “so 
small a matter as to be placed between two covers; 
or is the author one of those dangerous complacents 
who ‘knows not, and knows not that he knows not’?” 
Neither of these queries can be answered wholly 
in the negative, for the complete narrative is a long 
one, and no man can know it in all its details. Yet 
the difficulty is not one which can mend itself with 
time. If it were, there might be less excuse for the 
present work, which is offered more as a report of 
progress than as a final word upon the subject. In its 
preparation I have been governed by the belief that 
the most crying need of the student of our educa- 
tional history is a considerable mass of definite fact 
upon which to base his own generalizations, or with 
which to interpret those of others, rather than extended 
philosophical discussions of historical trend. Current 
educational literature is rich in the latter, though com- 
paratively barren of the former, and when it does 
appear, is of necessity disconnected. That the work 
is, then, essentially institutional— perhaps more appro- 
priately termed a Chronicle than a History —is a part 
of the plan, and if a defect, is one fully reckoned with, 
for of two evils the lesser has seemed to me to be the 
omission of the philosophy rather than the fact. When 
the book is used as a text for classroom work, the 
vii
-P-A-G-E-6
viii Preface 
  former can well be supplied by the instructor; when 
used by the general reader, the references have been 
so selected as to supply the lack. These are probably 
more profuse than would be necessary to meet the 
needs of most readers, yet are so classified through the 
use of different kinds of type as to constitute, in a 
sense, three separate bibliographies. In the reference 
lists at the ends of the chapters, the authors whose 
names are printed in bold-faced type are cited in the 
text of the chapter; those printed in italics are deemed 
especially important, while those in common type are 
not without value, and should be read by the student 
making an exhaustive study of the subject. The selec- 
tions are largely made from works which are likely to 
be found in the library of the educator, and would 
certainly be included in that of any normal school, or 
college, or in a public library of any pretension. I 
refer particularly to Barnard’s American Journal of 
Education, the Reports of the United States Commis- 
sioner of Education, the Proceedings of the National 
Educational Associations, files of the leading educa- 
tional journals (Educational Review, School Review, 
and Education are most frequently cited), and the 
Herbert B. Adams Contributions to American Educa- 
tional History, published as circulars of information by 
the United States Bureau of Education, together with a 
limited number of other circulars from the same source. 
When the book is used as a text, all of these works 
should be readily accessible to the student. 
The book is so arranged as to be studied in either 
one of two ways: chronologically throughout, by using 
the marginal references printed in bold-faced type. 
When this is done, the whole book will be covered in 
connection with Part I; or chronologically only for the 
development of elementary and secondary education, 
higher and special education being considered topically.
-P-A-G-E-7
  Preface ix 
To follow this plan, the bold-faced marginal references 
should be disregarded. 
I should be ungracious if I did not acknowledge my 
indebtedness to educators in every part of the country 
for their courtesy and kindness in supplying specific 
information for use in the volume. Rich as we are in 
historical sources, many facts of importance in a study 
like this are only in the possession of isolated indi- 
viduals who must be appealed to or the quest aban- 
doned. Almost without exception my appeals — which 
in some instances must have seemed inordinate — have 
been promptly responded to. The state superintend- 
ents of public instruction have been especially sinned 
against by me in this respect, though no class of edu- 
cators, from our national commissioner to the teacher 
in the rural school, has been entirely exempted; and I 
am alike grateful to them all. 
Particularly am I under obligations to my colleagues, 
Mr. J. E. Miller and Professor E. C. Baldwin, the former 
for work in the preparation of material, several of the 
chapters in Part I being largely based upon his studies; 
to the latter for invaluable aid in the revision of manu- 
script. I am under obligations also to members of the 
State Library School of the University of Illinois for the 
revision of references. And to any reader who will 
call my attention to inaccuracies which must have crept 
into the work in spite of every precaution, I shall be 
equally grateful.

THE GROWTH OF THE PEOPLE'S SCHOOLS 
CHAPTER I 
BEGINNINGS IN VIRGINIA 
THE _history 0 of education in the United States, even 
in the narrower sense of the history of its schools, has     
  ng wi 
ment, Although the ‘Spanish had for more than one 
‘hundred years been making paths in the American 
wilderness and the French had raised their flag on the 
Florida shores, that permanency of occupation which 
is a prerequisite to organized educational effort was 
nowhere discoverable until the Virginia settlement of. 
1607, and was lacking there afte the beginning. 
In the spring of that yearfone hundred and five men 
settled at Jamestown. They did not come to build 
homes, but to seek wealth in a land that was thought 
to glitter with gold. Among them were twelve com- 
mon laborers, four carpenters, several masons and 
blacksmiths, and forty-eight gentlemen. Such were 
these pioneers. Only a few of them were married, 
and these had left their families in England. The 
first few years were full of mismanagement and con- 
sequent suffering. The early settlers were in no 
way fitted for a battle with the wilderness. They came

to find gold, not to make homes, and it was not until 
repeated disappointmentxin the former quest had thor- 
oughly disheartened them that they were willing to ac- 
cept the latter alternative. For the first ten years of 
   the settlement we find no ev ces of schools, and even 
then they originated largel a ssionary ventures of 
nglish Church. _ 1616 ‘the king ordered the 
Bis hop of London to ts money for a college to be 
founded in ‘Virginia,’ and during the next three years 
sofiié 41500 were raised and sent over. In 1618 the fol- 
lowing instructions were given to Governor Yardly :—     
  “Whereas by a special grant and license from his Majesty, a gen- 
eral contribution hath been made for building and planting a college 
for the training up of the children of those infidels in true religion, 
moral virtue, and civility, and for other godliness, we do, therefore, 
according to a former grant and order, hereby ratify, confirm, and 
ordain that a convenient place be chosen and set out for the plant- 
ing ofa universityyat the said Henrico in time to come, and that in 
the meantime, preparation be made for the building of the said col- 
lege for the children of the infidels according to such instructions as 
we shall deliver. And we will ordain that ten thousand acres, partly 
of the lands they impaled and partly of the land within the territory 
of the said Henrico, be allotted and set out for the endowing of the 
said university and college with convenient possessions.” 
Professor Adams, in speaking of this grant, says : — 
“The proposed grant, which was duly made, included one thou- 
sand acres for an Indian college; the remainder was to be the founda- 
tion of a seminary of learning for the English.” 
The Virginia Company also gave more than £100 for a 
house, and several books toward a library. 
Sir Edwin Sandys, the treasurer of the Company, 
was back of this educational movement. By this time 
it had become evident that the Virginia project was 
more than a mere prospecting venture for gold, — was, 
in fact, to be a permanent English occupation, —and the 
éity of London sent one hundred children to the colony, 
together with private donations amounting to £500, to    
   
-P-A-G-E-23
    
  aid in their maintenance until they should be self-sup- 
porting, the Virginia Company agreeing 
“that all these children should be educated and brought up in some 
good trade or profession, so that they might gain their livelihood 
by the time they were twenty-one years old, or by the time they 
had served their seven years’ apprenticeship.” 
That these juvenile settlers were very acceptable to the colony is shown by the fact that more were asked | 
and sent over in 1620, on the same conditions. 
Before the close of the summer of 1620 Sandys, with 
the help of friends, succeeded in sending 1261 persons 
to America. It was also through him that “ninety 
young women of good breeding and modest manners 
were induced to emigrate to Jamestown” in the same 
year. 
The lands granted to the college were in part settled 
by the colonists, under the agreement that one-half of 
the profits should be retained by the tenants, while the 
other half should be used “ getting forward the work and 
for the maintenance of the tutors and scholars.” 
While the records apply indiscriminately the terms 
“college” and “ university ’ ” to this projected institu- 
tion of learning, it is plain that since untutoréd sav- 
ages and children were to be its students, the words 
lacked entirely their modern meaning. Doubtless the 
work with the former had a distinctly religious aim, 
though the following instructions given to Governor 
Wyatt in 1621 indicate that the practical side was not 
to be neglected. He was “to use means to convert the 
heathen, viz., to converse with some; each .town to 
teach some children fit for the college intended to be 
built . . . to put prentices to trades, and not let them 
forsake their trades for planting, or any such useless 
commodity.” 
But the terrible massacre of 1622, which depopulated 
the college ] lands and Teft the handful of survivors with

no thought except for _personal.safety, put an end to it 
all, and it is doubtful even if any actual instruction was 
ever given by this earliest prospective American Uni- 
versity. 
“Af Teast one other definite attempt to found schools 
had been made previous to the catastrophe of 1622. 
The records show that in the previous year one Dr. 
Copeland collected from passengers on one of the ships 
of the East India Company 470 to be used in building 
a church or school in Virginia. When this came to the 
notice of the court, a committee was appointed to take 
the matter in hand. This committee decided that a 
school was most needed, and that to apply the money 
to that purpose, rather than to the erection of churches, 
would best meet the wishes of the donors. In view of 
these conditions, they resolved “ for the erecting of a free 
school, which, being for the education of children and 
grounding of them in the principles of religion, civility 
of life, and humane learning, seemed to carry with it the 
greatest weight and highest consequence unto the plan- 
tation as that whereof both church and commonwealth 
take their original foundation and happy estate, this 
being also like to prove a work most acceptable unto 
the planters, through want whereof they have been 
hitherto constrained to their great cost to send their 
children from thence better to be taught... . That in 
honor of the East Indy benefactors, the same should be 
called the East Indy School, who shall have, precedence 
before any other to prefer their children thither to be 
brought up in the rudiments of learning. ... That 
this, as a collegiate or free school, should have depend- 
ence upon the college in Virginia, which should be 
made capable to receive scholars from the school into 
such scholarship and fellowship of said college, shall be 
endowed withal for the advancement of scholars as they 
arise by degrees and deserts in learning. That for the 
better maintenance of the schoolmaster and usher \in- 
  a
-P-A-G-E-25

  tended there to be placed, it was thought fit that it 
should be moved at the Next Quarter Court, that one 
thousand acres of land should be allotted unto the said 
school, and that five persons, besides an overseer of 
them, should be forthwith sent upon this charge .. . 
and that, over and above this allowance of land and 
tenants unto the schoolmaster, such as send their chil- 
dren to this school should give some benevolence unto 
the schoolmaster, for the better increase of his mainte- 
nance. ... That the planters there be stirred up to 
put their helping hands towards the speedy building 
of the said school, in respect their children are like to 
receive the greatest benefit thereby in their education ; 
—that those that exceed others in their bounty and 
assistance hereunto shall be privileged with the prefer- 
ment of their children to the said school before others 
that shall be found less worthy.” 
The Quarter Court referred to above, approved the 
report of the committee ; but I because the court found 
delegated to the colonial authorities, Workmen_were 
sent over in 1622 to erect_a house, and the following year 
the East India Company collected some money and 
gave it to the Virginia council to be expended on the 
school. A teacher, Caroloff, was brought to the colony, 
but conditions at the time of his arrival were not favor- 
able for educational movements, and nothing more is 
heard of the East India School in Virginia. 
Considering the magnitude of the disaster of 1622, 
and the suffering which it entailed, it could hardly have 
:been expected that immediate attention should be given 
to the needs of the young; and it is somewhat surpris- 
ing to find that in 1624 Sir Edwin Palmer “secured the 
grant of an island — probably for better protection —in 
the Susquehanna, f for the “ founding and maintenance of Neill, p. 83.

Hening, I, p. 252. Like its predecessors, this educational attempt proved, 
for various causes, abortive; and at Palmer’s death was 
lost sight of. 
\/ This year, 1624, is, however, memorable in our educa- 
tional history as marking the initiation of school legisla- 
tion. The at Assembly decided that each borough 
or hundred should by some just means secure a number 
of Indian children, who were to, be educated {in true 
religion and a civil course in life ; of which children the 
most towardly boys in wit and graces of nature (are) to 
be brought up by them in the first elements of litera- 
ture, so as to be fitted for the college intended for them, 
that from thence they may be sent to that work of con- 
version.” 
The records fail to.show what the results of this 
move were; but there is reason to believe that they 
wére more successful than their predecessors had been, 
and that some schools were actually established. 
In 1634 or 1635, began an era of schools in Virginia 
founded by private bequest. At that time one Ben- 
jamin Symms left by will two hundred acres of land 
and eight cows for a free school in Elizabeth County. 
This school was to be for the parish of Elizabeth City 
and Kiquotan. The justices of the peace of the county, 
together with the ministér“and church wardens of the 
city parish, and their successors, were to be trustees of 
the funds. The school opened in 1636. 
In 1643 the General Assembly, presided over by Gov- 
ernor William Berkeley, confirmed the will, encouraging 
others to make like provisions :—   
“Be it enacted and confirmed upon consideration had of the godly 
disposition and good intent of Benjamin Symms, deceased, in found- 
ing by his last will and testament a free school in Elizabeth County, 
for the encouragement of all others in like pious performances, that 
the said will and testament with all donations therein contained con- 
cerning the free school and the situation thereof in the said county 
and the land of pertaining to the same, shall be confirmed according
-P-A-G-E-27
  Beginnings in Virginia 4, 
to the true meaning and godly intent of the said testator, without 
any alienation or conversion thereof to any place or county.” 
In a record dated 1649 (possibly 1647) this school is 
further alluded to as follows : — 
“JT may not forget to tell you we have a free school, with two hun- 
dred acres of land, a fine house upon it, forty milch kine, and other 
accommodations to it ; the benefactor deserves perpetual memory ; 
his name is Mr. Benjamin Symms, worthy to be cherished. Other 
petty schools we have, too.” 
Other schools of a similar character were established 
soon after the middle of the seventeenth century. Fiske 
‘mentions four: Captain John Moon’s school, founded 
in 1655; Richard Russell’s, in 1667; Mr. King’s, in the 
same year; and the Eaton School, sometime prior to 
1689. He also expresses his belief that several others 
took their origin at about the same time, though nothing 
is on record concerning them, unless it be in the parish 
books of the region. Of the four schools mentioned, 
the first was founded through the benevolence of John 
Moon, who left four cows for educational and charitable 
purposes. A school in Newport parish, Isle of Wight 
County, seems to have been the result. 
The Eaton School, which Fiske places some time 
before 1689, was in the same region as the Symms 
School. Professor Brown thinks it was endowed some- 
time before 1646 by Thomas Eaton with 250 acres of 
land. The Symms and Eaton funds were finally united, 
and their income now goes to the Hampton High 
School. 
In addition to these four private schools, at least one 
other has left a definite record of itself. It was founded 
~-.n Newport County in 1675, by Henry Peasley, who de- 
voted to its support six hundred acres of land, ten cows, 
and one breeding mare. Later several slaves were 
added to its endowment by others. Regarding the sub-    Mass. Hist. Col.

who received their benefits, we know nothing. 
~ If we are to judge by. legislation enacted by the As- 
sembly of Virginia previous to 1650, there must either 
have been many other schools in operation in the colony, 
or teaching of an elementary nature was common in the 
home. It is certain that laws for compulsory educa- 
tion would not have antedated the general prevalence 
of schools, and we find the following law relative to 
orphans on the statute books for 1646:— 
“ All overseers and guardians of such orphans are enjoined by the 
authority aforesaid to educate and instruct them according to their 
best endeavors in Christian religion and in rudiments of learning, 
and to provide for them necessaries according to the competence of 
their estates.” 
All legislation with reference to orphans after this 
date prescribed some education. Of compulsory edu- 
cation Fiske says:— 
“There was, after 1646, a considerable amount of compulsory pri- 
mary education in Virginia, much more than is generally supposed, 
since the records of it have been buried in the parish vestry books. 
In the eighteenth century we find evidences that pains were taken to 
educate colored people.” 
Industrial education had its advocates in those days. 
Some parents were not training their children to work 
as it was thought proper, and though very poor, they 
were unwilling to bind their children out to others who 
could teach them some trade. To. remedy this, the 
Assembly decreed in 1646— “that the commissioners 
of the several counties respectively, do, at their dis- 
cretion, make choice of two children in each county 
at the age of eight or seven years at the least, either 
male or female, which are to be sent up to James City 
between this and June next, to be employed in the pub- 
lic flax houses under such master or mistress as shall be 
there appointed, in carding, knitting, and spinning.
-P-A-G-E-29
  Beginnings in Virginia 9 
And that the said children be furnished from the said 
county with six barrels of corn, two coverlets, or one rug 
and one blanket, one bed, one wooden bowl or tray, 
two pewter spoons, a sow shote of six months old, two 
laying hens, with convenient apparel, both linen and 
woollen, with hose and shoes. ... And it is further 
thought fit that the commissioners have caution not to 
take up any children but from such parents who by 
reason of their poverty are disabled to maintain and 
educate them.” At the same time provisions were made 
for the erection of two houses, each twenty feet by forty 
feet, for the accommodation of these children, ten thou- 
sand pounds of tobacco being appropriated to meet the 
expense.” 
When the colonial Assembly met in 1660, a new effort 
was made to establish schools. Here, as in New Eng- 
land, the needs of the church called for action. The 
following decree explains the condition : — 
“Whereas the want of able and faithful ministers in this country 
deprives us of those great blessings and mercies that always attend 
upon the service of God, which want, by reason of our great dis- 
tance from our native country, cannot in probability be always sup- 
plied from thence, Be it enacted, that for the advance of learning, 
education of youth, supply of the ministry and promotion of piety, 
there be land taken upon purchases for a college and free school 
and that there be with as much speed as may be convenient, hous- 
ing erected thereon for entertainment of students and scholars.” 
This same Assembly also provided for the raising of 
money with which to carry on this work : — 
“Be it enacted that there be a petition drawn up by this Grand 
Assembly to the King’s most excellent Majesty for his letters patent 
to collect and gather the charity of well disposed people in England 
for the erecting of colleges and schools in this country. . . .” 
Funds were to be solicited among the colonists, as 
well as in England. Even Governor Berkeley and the 
members of the Assembly contributed, as the following 
record shows :— Hening, I,p. 336.

“The Right Honorable his Majesty’s Governor, Council of State, 
and Burgesses of the present Grand Assembly have severally sub- 
scribed several considerable sums of money and quantities of tobacco 
(out of their charity and devotion) to be paid . . ., after a place is 
provided and built upon for that intent and purpose... . That 
the commissioners of the several counties do at the next following 
court in their several counties, subscribe such sums of money and 
tobacco, . . . as they think fit, and that they also take the subscrip- 
tions of such other persons at the said courts, who shall be willing 
to contribute towards the same.” 
And, lest any should escape who were willing to aid 
in the cause, it was ordered that word should be sent 
to the different churches that an opportunity might be 
given to all. 
Praiseworthy as were their efforts, it is to be feared 
that the results were not far-reaching. As late as 
1671, Governor Berkeley, when questioned concerning 
instruction in the colony, said :— 
“The same course that is taken in England out of towns; every 
man according to his ability instructing his children. . . . But, I 
thank God, there are no free schools nor printing, and I hope we 
shall not have these hundred years; for learning has brought diso- 
bedience and heresy and sects into the world, and printing has 
divulged them and libels against the best government. God keep 
us from both!” 
In 1691 the legislature sent Dr. William Blair to 
England to secure a charter for the:college which had 
often been under discussion, but which had never been 
established. He returned the following year with the 
royal document from which sprang the College of Will- 
iam and Mary.

  CHAPTER II 
Bie DUTCH SCHOOLS IN THE NEW NETHERLANDS 
In_the year 1633 the first school was established by 
the Dutc New Amsterdam, , with Adam Roelandsen 
as teacher. ) For this school two distinctions may with 
Henrico School, some justicé be claimed: First, that of being the earliest 
etc. P- 2.  ¢ in the colonies of which we have any definite record; 
and second, being the longest in continuous service, 
\ since its lineal descendant is still in active operation. } 
s has been shown in the previous chapter, several at- 
tempts to found schools had been made in the Virginia 
colony previous to this time, all of which had come to 
naught, unless we may suppose that the Assembly action 
of 1624 was productive of results. Since we cannot be 
certain of this, the claim of priority maintained by the 
ie Dutch ‘Reformed Church at New Amster-            
     
   event the winter of 1613-1614 by the stranded crew 
of a Dutch trading vessel. 
The following year a fort was erected, and the name 
New | Amsterdam _given to the settlement. Ten years 
‘ India Company, landed on the island, eight of them re- 
maining, while the rest sailed on up the river and made 
permanent settlement at Fort Orange(Albany). These 
Dutch settlers, unlike the early adventurers in Virginia, 
\, came to found homes. Soon after their arrival a colo- 
nial government was established, with Peter Minuit as 
governor, and in 1626 the Island of Manhattan— twenty 
12

thousand acres —-was-purchased_of the Indians.for.$24. 
From this time on the growth of the settlement was 
rapid. This was due in part to special concessions made 
to settlers in the New Amsterdam colonies. In 1629 
the West India Company issued the so-called “charter 
of exemptions,” under which all colonists were given 
freedom from taxation for a period of ten years, to- 
gether with special privileges of landholdings, trade, 
and self-government. In return for these liberal terms, 
the settlers were, however, enjoined as follows by the 
company : — 
“The Patroons and the colonists shall, in particular, endeavor to 
find out ways and means whereby they may support a minister and 
schoolmaster, that thus the service of God and zeal for religion may 
not grow cool and be neglected among them, and they shall, for the 
first, procure a comforter of the sick there.” 
The last-named functionary seems to have been an 
important officer in the colony. Even previous to this 
formal demand for his services (1626), Sebastian Jan 
Crol and Jan Huyck had each acted in the capacity, 
which was both spiritual and medical. Since their duties 
were often, in the later days of the colony, performed by 
the schoolmaster, it has been inferred by some that Crol 
and Huyck had also kept school. 
Of this we find no sufficient corroboration. It is how- 
ever certain that in 1633 the colony found itself in a 
position to comply with that part of the company’s in- 
junction having to do with the school, and Roelandsen 
was sent from Holland to be its master. 
The work of the school was strictly elementary in its 
nature. Whereas the colonists in Virginia seem to have 
been actuated by the missionary spirit in the establish- 
ment of schools principally for Indians and orphans, and 
the Puritans in New England recognized at first only 
a need for higher education for the maintenance of a 
learned clergy, the Dutch began at the bottom, with their

own children. In the matter of popular education they 
were leaders. ~~. 
Roelandsen’s career seems to have been a checkered 
one. He was involved in no less than fifteen lawsuits, 
one of which he brought against a debtor for the pay- 
ment of a wash bill. This would lead us to wonder 
whether the schoolmaster of those days, among his 
varied duties, was public laundryman. In another case 
at law he was defendant in a suit for passage- money 
from Holland. This he won, having proved that he 
worked his way, while his son, who was his fellow-pas- 
senger, “said the prayers.” 
Of the exact character of his school work, which he . 
relinquished in 1638, we know nothing. In the same 
year we find the first record of a public tax for school 
purposes. Among a series of laws relating to various 
matters of public importance is the following : — 
  “Each householder and inhabitant shall bear such tax and public 
charge as shall hereafter be considered proper for the maintenance 
of clergymen, comforters for the sick, schoolmasters, and such like 
necessary officers.” 
Within the next few years at least one other private 
school was established and presided over by Jan Steven- 
sen, and it is not improbable that there were more. 
This might be inferred by the fact that “as early as 
1642, it was customary, in. marriage contracts, whenever 
the f bride was-a-widow having children, for the parties 
to ‘promise to bring up the children decently, accord- 
‘ing to their ability, to provide them with necessary 
clothing and food, to keep them at school, to let them 
learn reading, writing, and a good trade;’ to which was 
sometimes added ‘as honest parents ought and are 
bound to do, and as they can answer before God and 
man. 
This would certainly have been impossible unless. 
. schools had been available.
-P-A-G-E-35
    
Dutch Schools in the New Netherlands 15 
That they were not, however, very much in evidence 
is shown by one of the first public utterances of the 
renowned Peter Stuyvesant upon his arrival as director- 
general of the colony in 1647. He said: — 
“Whereas, by want of proper place, no school has been kept in 
three months, by which the youth is spoiled, such is proposed, where 
a convenient place may be adapted to keep the youth from the street 
and under a strict subordination.” 
It is evident that by this he must have meant official 
public school, for Stevensen’s school was at that time in 
operation. A marked distinction was made between 
_ these two classes of schools. The teacher of the former 
was a public official, and his appointment rested jointly 
with the West India Company and the Classis of Am- 
sterdam. 
Usually when reference to a school is found in the 
records, it is to the official public school. From the 
first_organization of schools in New Amsterdam, till 
the management “and supervision of this school was in 
the hands of the deacons. During the period of Dutch 
rule, no private teacher could follow his calling without 
a license from civil and ecclesiastical authorities. This 
fact’séems to have given rise to much trouble on the 
part of some of the early aspirants to schoolroom honors. 
Because Jacob van Corler. had disregarded the rule 
and had “arrogated to himself to keep school,” he was 
warned not to teach until he had solicited and obtained 
from the director and council “‘an act 2” propria forma.” 
The people, however, were on his side, and when he 
was ordered “not to keep any school,” they found 
“themselves greatly interested thereby, as their children 
had forgot what the above-named Jacob van Corler had 
to their great satisfaction previously taught them in 
reading, writing, and cyphering, which was much more 
than any other person, no one excepted; therefore they Van der Kemp,

request that the above-named Corler may be allowed 
again to keep school; and although the above-named 
burgomasters and two schepens have spoken verbally 
thereon to your Honors and your Honors were not 
pleased to allow it, for reasons thereunto moving your 
Honors, they therefore, in consequence of the humble 
supplication of the burghers and inhabitants afore- 
said, again request that your Honors may be pleased 
to permit the above-named Corler again to keep 
school.” 
The director-general and the council were, however, 
obdurate, replying that “school-keeping and the ap- 
pointment of schoolmasters depend absolutely from the 
Jus patronatus, in virtue of which we interdicted school- 
keeping to Jacob van Corler, as having arrogated it to 
himself without our orders—in which resolutions we 
do as yet persist.” Corler was seemingly refused per- 
mission merely because he had attempted to teach with- 
out consulting the authorities, for, when he was first 
warned to desist, it was only until he should receive per- 
mission in legal form. 
The requirements for certification seem not to have 
been very rigid: “At least bécause Johannes van Gelder 
(1662) was “tolerably well acquainted with reading and 
writing, it has happened that several of the principal in- 
habitants of this city advised and encouraged him too, 
to open a public school,” and so he petitioned for and 
was granted the privilege of “keeping school.” 
In 1649 the “ Nine Men”! drew up a “ Remonstrance,” 
“explaining to the Fatherland their grievances. Their 
minister had gone, and conditions were discouraging. 
As for education, they said : — 
  “There should be a public school, provided with at least two 
good masters, so that, first of all, in so wild a country, where there 
1 The people elected eighteen men, from whom the governor selected 
nine as an advisory board.
-P-A-G-E-37
Dutch Schools in the New Netherlands 17 
are many loose people, the youth be well taught and brought up, not 
only in reading and writing, but also in the knowledge and fear of 
the Lord. As it is now, the school is kept very irregularly ; one and 
another keeping it according to his pleasure, and as long as he 
thinks proper.” 
This complaint, coming from the representation of the 
people, and implying neglect on the part of the higher 
officers, moved the director to make reply through his 
secretary, Cornelis van Tienhoven. He acknowledged 
that the new schoolhouse, toward which the “ common- 
alty had contributed something,” was not yet built, but 
that the blame was with the churchwardens who had 
charge of the funds. That the youth were in want of 
schools only to the extent of the “circumstances of the 
country.” The communication closed with the some- 
what ironical retort : — 
“Tf they (the people of New Netherlands) are such patriots as 
they appear to be, let them be leaders in generous contributions for 
such laudable objects, and not complain when the Directors re- 
quested a collection toward the erection of a church and a school.” 
In 1650 the classis, at Amsterdam, took cognizance 
of conditions in the colony and sent over “a school- 
master, who shall also act as comforter of the sick. He 
is considered an honest and pious man... . The Lord 
grant that he may for a long time exemplify the favor- 
able testimony which he carried with him from here to 
the edification of the youth.” 
The path of these Dutch schoolmasters was not strewn 
with roses. A further account may put the reader into 
closer sympathy with them. In 1654 William Verstius 
asked the classis for an increased salary, but in this he 
was not successful. In his resignation, which promptly 
followed, he states that “there are now several persons 
fully competent to acquit themselves in this charge.” 
Harmanus van Hoboocken was appointed to take the 
place of Verstius. The salary, the work, and appointive 
power are seen in the minutes of March 23, 1655:—

“, . . The Noble Lords of the Supreme Council, with the con- 
sent of the respected Consistory of this city, appointed Harmanus 
van Hoboocken as chorister and schoolmaster of this city at 35 
guilders? per month, and 100 guilders annual expenditures; who 
promises to conduct himself industriously and faithfully, persuant to 
the instructions already given, or hereafter to be given.” 
The council minutes for August 11 contain the fol- 
lowing with reference to Hoboocken : — 
“A petition being read of Harmanus van Hoboocken, now chor- 
ister in this city, soliciting — as he is burdened with a wife and four 
small children, without possessing any means for their sustenance 
—that his salary be paid to him monthly, or at least, quarterly, so 
is, after deliberation given an apostil as long as the supplicant re- 
mains in service, he may depend on the punctual payment of his 
salary.” 
A census of New Amsterdam in 1656 showed 120 
houses and 1000 inhabitants. The increase in popula- 
tion and the partial destruction of the schoolhouse by 
fire again brings the teacher before the council. The 
accounts of this event do not agree in all points, but the 
following is given as being fairly satisfactory :— 
“To the Honorable Lords, Burgomasters, and Schepens of the 
city of New Amsterdam: Harmanus van Hoboocken, schoolmaster 
of this city, respectfully requests that your Honors would be pleased 
to grant him the Hall and the side room for the use of the school 
and as a dwelling, inasmuch as he, the petitioner, does not know 
how to manage for the proper accommodation of the children, dur- 
ing the winter, for they much require a place adapted for fire, and to 
be warmed, for which their present tenement is wholly unfit. He, the 
petitioner, burdened with a wife and children, is greatly in need of a 
dwelling for them; and . . . he anticipates great inconvenience, not 
knowing how to manage for the accommodation of the school chil- 
dren ; and if your Honors cannot find any, he, the petitioner, requests 
your Honors to be pleased to allow him the rent of the back room 
where Geurt Coerten at present occupies, which he, the petitioner,

Dutch Schools in the New Netherlands 19 
The court could not grant the petition in full as the 
rooms were out of repair, but he was allowed 100 
guilders yearly with which to secure suitable rooms. 
That the development of schools was extremely slow 
is shown by the following extract from a formal report 
sent to Holland from New Amsterdam in 1657 :— 
“, .. It is to be added that (to our knowledge) not one of all 
these places, whether Dutch or English villages, hath a schoolmaster, 
except the Manhattans, Beverwyck, and now are also at Fort Casmir, 
on the South River; and though some parents would give their 
children some instruction, yet they experience much difficulty, . . .; 
1. Because some villages are only in their first establishment, and 
whilst people come naked and poor from Holland, they have not 
means to provide a minister and schoolmaster; 2. Because there 
are few qualified persons in this country who can or will teach.” 
In 1658 the colonists thought that they had come to 
. the point where they might maintain more than an ele- 
mentary school. Reverend Driesius was the first to urge 
a Latin school and its advantages. He even expressed 
his willingness to be the teacher. A petition was sent 
to the managers of the company, in which the following 
paragraph relating to the Latin school also hints at the 
very elementary instruction that had been given in the 
schools : — 
“Laying before your Honors the great augmentation of the youth 
of the Province and place, which yearly increases more and more, 
and finds itself now very numerous, and though many of them can 
read and write, the burgers and inhabitants are nevertheless inclined 
to have their children instructed in the most useful languages, the 
chief of which is the Latin tongue; and as there are no means to 
do so here, the nearest being at Boston, in N. England, a great dis- 
tance from here, and many of the burgers and inhabitants of this 
place and neighborhood having neither the ability nor the means to 
send their children thither, we shall therefore again trouble your 
Honors, and humbly request that your Honors would be pleased to 
send us a suitable person for master of a Latin school, in order that 
our children may be instructed in, and study such language, not 
doubting but were such person here, many of the neighboring places 
would send their children hither to be instructed in that tongue ; Pratt, p. 846.

hoping that, increasing from year to year, it may finally attain to 
an Academy, whereby this place, arriving at great splendor, your 
Honors shall have the reward and praise next to God the Lord who 
will grant his blessing to it. On your Honors sending us a school- 
master, we shall endeavor to have constructed a suitable place or 
school.” 
The following year (1659) Dr. Alexander Carolus 
Curtius, a professor in Lithuania, was engaged and sent 
over to take charge of the school. He was to have a 
salary of 500 florins! per year, one-fourth of this to be 
paid him before embarking, so that he might procure 
some needed books. He was to have 100 guilders with 
which to provide some necessary articles, and besides 
was to have a garden and orchard given him in New 
Amsterdam. He might give private instruction, if it 
did not interfere with his teaching in the Latin school. 
On July 4 he appeared in court and was told that the 
city would allow him 200 florins yearly as a present. 
The treasurer also gave him an order for 50 florins 
besides, which he accepted with thanks. Being a physi- 
cian, he also practised medicine. He did not meet the 
expectations of the people or of the company. The 
court complained that he was taking too much pay 
from his pupils, and the people said that he did not 
keep order, for the pupils “beat each other and tore 
the clothes from each other’s backs.” His reply to the 
patrons was that his hands were tied, as some of the 
parents forbade him punishing their children. Besides 
all this, he was involved in a suit about the price of a 
hog. Losing the suit did not make him any more popu- 
lar than he had been. As a result of all his troubles, it 
was thought best to have a new teacher. 
In 1660 Hoboocken again petitioned for an allow- 
ance, since he was “behindhand with the building of 
the school, and for divers other reasons.” The council 
decided to pay him “his current year’s salary ... at a 
1A florin is worth about 40 cents,

more convenient season . . . and his allowance is hence- 
forth abolished.” 
School-teaching was sometimes taken up as a last 
resort. Jan Juriaense Becker, “through the caprices of 
the unsteady fortune . . . has been compelled to become 
a tavern-keeper . . . for which he nearly sacrificed all 
what he possessed — and whereas the supplicant is ap- O'Callaghan2, 
III, p. 407. 
prehensive that many difficulties, and even poverty is 
threatening him and his family,” being an old employee 
of the company he asked that he might be employed as 
a writer for the company, and if that was not possible, 
“that then the supplicant might be permitted to keep 
school, to instruct the youth in reading, in writing, etc.” 
This touching appeal was favorably heard, and he was 
granted permission “to keep school.” 
In January of 1662 Rev. Aigidius Luyck arrived at 
New Amsterdam and became the successor to Curtius 
in the Latin school. His salary seems not to have been 
fixed at first, so that some anxiety arose on his part. 
In a petition, after some explanation, he says: — 
“T offer, notwithstanding, cheerfully to continue my service, but 
solicit most earnestly and humbly that the Director General, with 
his high and faithful Council, that it may please them to provide 
me with a decent salary, so as I cannot doubt, it shall meet their 
approbation, as well knowing that I cannot live on the small pay- 
ment which is received from my disciples — and asa laborer deserves 
his wages —and if I might obtain a favorable resolution, my ardor 
and zeal to acquit myself well to my duty must of course increase — 
by which I am encouraged to remain.” 
So serious did the matter of salary become, that he 
even petitioned for permission “to sail—on a short 
trip — under God’s guidance to the Fatherlande; to 
solicit there in person.” The case was finally settled by 
allowing “the Rev. Aegidius Luyck” wampum to the 
amount of 1000 guilders annually, one-half of which was 
to be paid by the company. 
Luyck first came to the colony to be private instructor Van der Kemp,

  Pratt, passim, to Director Stuyvesant’s children, and it was because of 
his success in teaching them, that others requested that 
he should be appointed to continue the Latin school. 
In 1663 he reports twenty pupils, among whom were two 
from Virginia and two from Fort Orange. At the same 
time he was expecting ten or twelve more from these 
places. He was also arranging for some of them to 
board with him. When the English took possession, he 
took the oath of allegiance. In 1665 he was in Hol- 
land, assisting Stuyvesant in justifying the surrender of 
New Amsterdam without resistance. He returned to 
New Amsterdam, and at the recapture in 1674 he was 
burgomaster. When the English again took possession 
he refused to take the oath and returned to Holland. 
Mr. Pratt, in his Axnals of Public Education in the 
State of New York, gives a list of thirty teachers who 
taught in that colony during the Dutch rule; of these 
teachers, ten conducted private, and twenty public, 
schools; some for a short period, others for a number 
of years. 
On the whole, we cannot fail to be impressed with 
the conscientious attempts of the sturdy Dutch burghers 
Vto provide schools for their children. Thirty masters 
in as many years among a population as limited as was 
that in the New Netherlands even at the time of the 
British occupancy, is a worthy showing, though those 
masters —like others before and since —were not all 
that might be desired.

CHAPTER III 
EARLY SCHOOLS IN THE NEW ENGLAND COLONIES 
  Massachusetts Bay 
Tue sturdy settlers upon the New England coast 
played a much more important part in the making of | 
our school system than had their predecessors in Vir- 
ginia, or those at the mouth of the Hudson. These 
were of quite different stock. While the Virginia 
settlements were peopled with adventurers, or at best 
by those who hoped soon to return to the mother coun- 
try, and New Amsterdam with the poorest of Dutch 
peasantry, within the veins of the first New England 
colonists ran blood as blue as any in old England, and 
the first step of each upon the rugged shore was with 
the full consciousness that it would never be retraced. 
Though willing to undergo hardships and privations 
for conscience’ sake, they set to work energetically to 
lessen them as much as was in their power. Physical 
hardships they could put up with without a murmur, 
-but spiritual and intellectual deprivations—never. So 
“they early set up schools, patternéd as closely as pos- 
sible after those which they had attended in the mother . 
country. The early comers, especially to the Boston 
colony, were singularly well fitted for the task of estab- 
lishing them. Never since, in the history of our coun- 
try, has. the population as a class been so highly 
educated as during the first half-century of the Massa- 
chusetts settlements. One man in every 250 had been 
graduated from an English-umiversity, and both clergy 
and laity had brought from home enviable reputations 
for superior service both in church and college.

It was but natural, then, that the fear so often expressed 
that education and religion might die with the first gen- 
eration, should result in the establishment of institu- 
tions for their perpetuation. The_first was the Latin 
Grammar School, though antedating Harvard College 
but two years. The prime mover in the enterprise is 
generally conceded to have been Rev. John Cotton, 
one of the most brilliant products of Emanuel College, 
Cambridge, where he had remained some years-after 
- graduation, as tutor. During his subsequent pastorates 
in England, as well as in his native town, he had been 
much interested in the grammar schools. No better 
leader could have been found for such a movement 
among a cultivated and refined people, of whom Palfrey 
says :— ly 
“Tn all its generations of worth and refinement, Boston has never 
seen an assembly more illustrious for generous qualities . . . than 
were the magistrates of the young colony who welcomed Cotton and 
his fellow voyagers at Winthrop’s table.” 
It was in 1635 that the town-meeting voted “that 
our brother Philemon Parmount shall be interested to 
become schoolmaster for the nourturing of children 
with us,” and the long career of the school was fully 
started. This was almost exactly five years after the 
first settlement in Boston, and fifteen after the begin- 
ning at Plymouth. 
Unfortunately we know but little about Parmount. 
His connection with the school did not last for more 
than a year, and tradition has it that after going into 
the wilderness of New Hampshire as one of the followers 
of Anne Hutchinson, he was one of the founders of 
Exeter in that state. Certain it is that he was a settled 
pastor there in 1638. In 1636 we find record that “at 
a general meeting of the richer inhabitants there was 
given toward the maintenance of a free school with us, 
Mr. Daniel Maud, being now also chosen thereunto.”

Cheever, The list of “richer inhabitants,” some forty in number, 
who subscribed to the fund, is headed by the name of 
Governor Vane, followed by his deputy John Winthrop 
and William Bellingham, each of whom gave £ 10, and 
since the entire sum pledged was but £40 6s., the re- 
mainder must have been given in small sums. Besides 
his regular salary, Maud had assigned to him a “ gar- 
den plot” upon condition of building thereon if need 
be. He continued as teacher until 1642, when he took 
up a pastorate at Dover, New Hampshire, thus follow- 
ing the path of his predecessor, Parmount. Private 
subscriptions did not long remain the sole support of 
the school, though the rate bill and tax were not re- 
sorted to in the earliest years, the first direct reference 
to fees being in 1679. To supplement the fees the 
town granted certain islands, and in some instances, the 
rents accruing from these possessions were devoted to 
the support of the school. For example, in 1641 it was 
voted that Deere Island should be improved and the 
income derived from it devoted to a free school. But 
that the income from such a source could not have been 
sufficient to meet the expenses of the school is evident 
from the fact that in 1644 the island was leased for 
three years at £7 a year. In 1660 the general court 
granted Boston one thousand acres of land for the sup- 
port of its schools. 
.\, The fame of the Boston Latin School rests not alone 
upon the fact that it was the first school to be started 
in the colony, but perhaps fully as much upon its great 
good fortune-in having at its head for more than a third 
of a century the illustrious Ezekiel Cheever. So far as 
we have record, Cheever had begun his work as a 
teacher in 1642 in New Haven, going to [Ipswich in 
1651, to Charlestown in 1661, and removing to Boston 
in 1670, where he passed the remainder of his long and 
useful life. Seldom has a teacher been more praised 
by his contemporaries, nor mourned by his friends. His

funeral sermon was preached by Cotton Mather, who 
also wrote a poem in honor of his former teacher, in 
both of which he bestows great praise on Cheever and 
his work. The poem begins : — 
| 
\ “You that are men, and thoughts of manhood know, 
Be just now to the man that made you so.” 
But he finds himself unable to write as he should, 
“Ink is too vile a liquor, liquid gold 
Should fill the pen, by which such things are told. . 
His work he loved: oh, had we done the same: 
| Our play days still to him ungrateful came. 
t And yet so well our work adjusted lay, ~ 
| We came to work as if we came to play.” 
In speaking of his life, he continued : — 
“He died . . . in the ninety-fourth year of his age: after he had 
been a skillful, painful, faithful schoolmaster for seventy years.” 
“We generally concur in acknowledging that New England has 
meyer known a better schoolmaster.” 
All joined Mather in speaking his praises. Cheever’s 
Accidence was the first great text-book. in colonial times. 
Tt was a beginning Latin book, and so great was its popu- 
larity that it commanded considerable respect, even in 
the nineteenth century. The last edition was printed in 
1838. 
Charlestown in 1636 joined in the educational move- 
ment inaugurated by Boston, and arranged with William 
Witherell “to keep a school for twelve month, to begin 
the eight of August, and to have £40 this year.” 
Since nothing is said as to the source of the money, it 
would seem that the expenses were to be met by the 
public. This school was not, however, wholly free in 
1647, being supported in part by the rent from some 
* islands and the income from the Mystic Weir. 
In 1659 the general court granted Charlestown one 
thousand acres of land, on condition that it be improved 
and used for the support of the school. If these condi- Text-books,

tions could not be complied with by Charlestown, the 
land was to be given to the town that should meet the 
requirements. 
In 1637 Rev. John Fiske, wealthy and well edu- 
cated, settled at Salem and began to teach school. In 
this work he continued until early in 1640, when the 
town-meeting appointed a “young Mr. Norris” in his 
stead. Norris seems to have been successful, for he 
taught the children of Salem for upwards of thirty 
years. Thereafter the school had graduates of Harvard 
for its masters for more than a century. 
Not all of our town schools of to-day can boast of 
such a record. The school was supported by subscrip- 
tions from the patrons, while the town rate provided for 
the children of the poor. 
> ag The first public school in America to be supported by 
direct taxation “ upon the inhabitants of a town” was 
established at Dorchester, Massachusetts, in. May, 1639. 
In 1636 David Thompson had settled upon Thomp- 
son’s Island, off the coast of the colony town, and in 
1638 he gave the island to the town on the payment 
of twelvepence yearly rental. NHaving transferred the 
island to the town, the town council met May 20, 1639, 
and adopted the following order : — 
“It is ordered the twentieth day of May, 1639, that there shall 
be arent of £20 a year imposed forever on Thompson’s island, to 
be paid by every person that hath propriety in said island, according 
to the proportion that any such person shall from time to time enjoy 
and possess there, and this toward the maintenance of a school in 
Dorchester. This rent of £20 a year to be paid to such school- 
master as shall undertake to teach English, Latin, and other tongues, 
also writing. The said schoolmaster to be chosen from time to 
time by the freemen, and it is left to the discretion of the elders and 
the seven men for the time being whether maids shall be taught 
with the boys or not. For the levying of this £20 yearly from the 
particular persons who ought to pay it according to this order, it is 
further ordered that some man shall be appointed by the seven men 
for the time being to receive this, and on refusal to levy it by dis-
-P-A-G-E-49
  Early Schools in New England Colonies 29 
tress, and not finding distress, such person as so refuseth payment 
shall forfeit the land he hath in propriety in said island.” 
Here, the first teacher was the Rev. Thomas Water- 
house. 
Dorchester, as we see, had its first school in 1639. Text-books, 
In 1645 the town appointed a committee of three “war- P- 210 
dens or overseers of the school.” These men, residents 
of Dorchester, were to hold office for life unless for a 
“weighty” reason they be removed. This first school 
committee appointed by any municipality in this coun- 
| try-put-the-schools in touch-with the town-meeting, and 
\ no doubt laid the foundation of our present local board 
‘of directors. 
The town-meeting of Newbury in 1639 granted ten Bush’, p, 1171, 
acres of land to Anthony Somerby “for his encourage- 
ment to keep school one year.” It was decided to 
raise the teacher’s salary —£20—by town rate. A 
committee was appointed to have charge of the school, 
and there was some talk of building a schoolhouse. 
The following year it was decided “ that the town should 
* pay 424 by the year to maintain a free school at the 
meeting-house.” Yet the vote seems not to have been 
by any means unanimous, since seventeen residents LIK 
“ desired to have their dissents recorded.” TA 
It was in 1636 that the general court took up the Harvard Col. 
question of higher education, and the result..was the B.A se0- 
founding of Harvard College. Ten years later, in 1641, Clews,p. 58. 
it anticipated its later enactment for the furtherance of 
elementary education by appealing to the elders of the 
church to prepare “a catechism for the instruction of 
youth in the grounds of religion.” 
The fact that these matters were put into the hands 
of the elders, and that merely a catechism was asked 
for, has caused this act to be regarded as a religious 
rather than as an educational move. But at that time 
the clergy were the acknowledged educational leaders, 
   
-P-A-G-E-50
Appendix B. 
  30 «©The Growth of the Peoples Schools 
and the civil and religious interests were closely united. 
That the youth should be instructed “in the grounds of 
religion” meant much to a people who used the Bible 
in the court room as freely as in the pulpit, who made 
it the foundation of their civil as well as of their reli- 
gious laws. That their children should be able to under- 
stand and read that book which had so much to do with 
their laws and lives concerned them greatly, and was a 
weighty reason for establishing schools. 
Except for these two enactments, the first of which 
was special (Harvard College) and the second of little 
educational purport, the Massachusetts law of 1642 was 
the first upon the statutes in any way affecting educa- 
tion in the colony. This was, however, far-reaching in 
its consequence; and because of its wise provisions, 
deserves perpetuation. 
In it the court recognized that in many instances the 
children were not being trained “in learning and labor 
and other employments which may be profitable to the 
commonwealth,” and emphasized the responsibility of 
parents and masters in the matter. Recognizing with 
wonderful foresight the needs of a democratic commu- 
nity, when we consider its lack of experience under such 
a form of government, the court instructed the select- 
men to make investigation from time to time, and place 
in better guardianship those children that were being 
neglected. It did not as yet make the instruction of 
the youth a public responsibility, though it did insist 
that they should be taught in the home. Should any 
parents or masters refuse to render proper accounts, 
they were to be fined, and their children taken from 
them. Should the difficulties of enforcing the law prove 
too great for the overseers, they could call upon the 
civil authorities. 
Here was also ample provision for practical industrial 
education, the tools and the material for the work to be 
provided by the several towns. Both boys and girls dl
-P-A-G-E-51
Early Schools in New England Colonies 31 
were within the provisions of the law, and their conduct 
toward each other was to be carefully guarded. These 
colonists seem to have caught the spirit of the old Jew- 
ish saying, “ He that does not teach his son a trade does 
the same as if he taught him to steal.” 
If the act of 1642 does not free the people of Mas- 
sachusetts from the charge of being merely religious 
bigots, that of 1645 may show further what they consid- 
ered “profitable to the commonwealth.” It was then 
decreed by the court that “whereas it is conceived that 
the training up of youth to the art and practice of arms 
will be of great use to this country in divers respects 
. that all youth within the jurisdiction from ten years 
old to the age of sixteen years, shall be instructed by 
= one of the officers of the band.” 
~J It is not known just when the school at Cambridge 
began; but in 1643 Elijah Corlett had ‘very well ap- 
roved himself for his abilities, dexterity, and pain- 
ulness in teaching and educating the youth under 
im.” 
This school was never large, only nine students being 
in attendance in 1680. Corlett continued to teach until 
his death, which occurred forty-three years after we first 
hear of him as a teacher. He was known as a good 
instructor, but a “very poor” man. The Cambridge 
school had some Indian pupils for whom a special grant 
had been made; the others paid regular fees. The 
town, however, felt that the teacher deserved better 
treatment than he was receiving, and in 1648 “it was 
agreed at a meeting of the whole town, that there should 
be land sold of the common for the gratifying of Mr. 
Corlett for his pains in keeping a school in the town, 
the sum of £10, if it can be attained, provided it shall 
not prejudice the cow common.” 
Fortunately for the gratifying of Mr. Corlett the 
“cow common” proved adequate for the needs; and six 
months later the records allude to the payment of Aro

as a gift. In 1654 the town again came to his relief by 
levying a rate for his benefit. 
From the Hopkins charity fund he was granted an 
annual appropriation of 47 Ios., but he never had more 
than the bare necessities of life. His successors at 
Cambridge for a hundred years had the same struggle 
for existence. 
In 1659 the town was granted one thousand acres of 
land by the general court on “condition that they for- 
ever appropriate it” to the grammar school. Should 
they fail to do so, the benefit was to pass to the nearest 
town that did support a grammar school. 
Cotton Mather places Corlett by the side of Ezekiel 
Cheever in the well-known lines :— 
“Tis Corlett’s pains and Cheever’s we must own, 
That thou, New England, are not Scythia grown.” 
\\He further speaks of him as, “that memorable old 
schoolmaster in Cambridge from whose education our 
college and country have received so many of its worthy 
men that he is himself to have his name celebrated in 
our church history.” 
Roxbury opened a school in 1645. The record runs :— 
“The inhabitants of Roxbury, in consideration of their religious 
care of posterity, have taken into consideration how necessary the 
education of their children in literature will be to fit them for public 
service, both in the church and commonwealth, in succeeding ages ; 
they therefore unanimously consented and agreed to erect a free 
school.” 
The teacher’s salary was fixed at £20, appropriated 
IV, pt.i, p. 438. . from the rents of certain lands which were to be forever 
devoted to the support of the school. A committee of 
seven was appointed. Vacancies on this committee 
were to be filled by the founders or their heirs. If, 
\ however, after a reasonable length of time, vacancies 
\ should not be so filled, then the rest of the committee
-P-A-G-E-53
  Early Schools in New England Colonies 33 
was to make the appointment. This committee was to 
select the teacher and have general supervision of the 
school and its funds. This was a private school with a 
permanent endowment. In 1660 the general court gave 
the town five hundred acres of land for the support of a 
free school. 
In 1671 Thomas Bell left by will two hundred acres 
of land to support the children of the poor of Roxbury. 
This was turned over to the school. At times citizens 
complained much because of the private nature of the 
school. The opposition to it became so great that in 
1669 a committee was appointed by the court to study 
the question and effect an amicable settlement. The 
investigation proved favorable to the school, and the 
court supported the trustees. Provisions were also made 
for the levying of taxes, in case the income of the school 
fell short of the required amount. But it was expressly 
stated “that the said donors be absolutely and wholly 
free from any such levy or imposition. That the levy 
be equally made on all inhabitants, excepting only those 
that do, by virtue of their subscription, pay the full pro- 
pprtion of the annual charges.” 
Roxbury was the home of Rev. John Eliot, the apostle 
to the Indians. As an early advocate of education, he 
deserves rank by the side of Cotton. Of him and his 
work Cotton Mather says: — 
“J cannot forget with what ardor I ever heard him pray, ina synod 
of these churches which met at Boston. . . . ‘Lord, for schools 
everywhere among us, O that our schools may flourish. That every 
member of this assembly may go home and procure a good school 
to be encouraged in the town where he lives. That before we die 
we may see a good school encouraged in every plantation of the 
country.’ God so blessed his endeavors that Roxbury could not be 
content without a free school in the town; and the issue of it has 
been one thing which has made me almost put the title of Schola 
Zilustris wpon that little nursery ; that is, Roxbury has afforded more 
scholars, first for the college and then for the public, than any town 
of its bigness, or, if I mistake not, of twice its bigness, in all New 
England.”

e 34. The Growth of the People's Schools 
These six schools, established in the first half of the 
seventeenth century, together with one at Braintree, 
which seems to have been started as early as 1645, fur- 
nished the students for Harvard College, and the work 
which they were doing may be roughly estimated by its 
entrance requirements. They were all in a sense second- 
ary schools, since admission to them presupposed at 
least some slight knowledge of the English language. 
Since even so much proficiency was not by any means 
the rule with the children of the colony, in spite of the 
admonition of the act of 1642, the general court again 
turned its attention to educational matters, and in 1647 
framed the most important school law of our whole 
history. This law~marks~a tremendous step forward; 
so far forward, in fact, that the people had hardly caught 
up with it in two centuries’ time, with the result that its 
enforcement was practically impossible. Yet it has been 
the model for a vast amount of subsequent legislation, 
and may be taken as the mother of all our school laws. 
It contained all the essentials of the purest democracy. 
The teacher was to be appointed by the people and paid 
by the people “to teach all such pupils as shall resort to 
him, to write and read,” without a shadow of class dis- 
tinction. Nor was the law simply permissive; it was 
mandatory as well, requiring that schools be established, 
and that a fine of £5 await those communities that failed 
to observe its edicts. There was to be an elementary 
school for towns of fifty families and a grammar school 
for those of one hundred families. But like so many 
laws enacted since its day, this one had its weak point, 
well-nigh ruining its usefulness. The fines were too 
small, The town disposed to do so could pay its fine 
much cheaper than it could keep its school, and we are 
forced to believe that many were so disposed to do. In 
fact, it has been said that Boston alone, of all the towns 
within the colony, complied fully with the law of 1647 
during each of the years that it was on the statute books.
-P-A-G-E-55
Early Schools in New England Colonies 35 
The defects were, however, discovered in time and reme- 
died by increasing the fines to be imposed for non-com- 
pliance. 
In 1649 Watertown decided to build a schoolhouse, 
and voted the necessary funds. “ John Sherman was 
appointed to procure the schoolhouse built; and to 
have it built 22 foot long: and 14 foot wide and 9 foot 
between joints.” In looking about for a teacher, the 
selectmen “agreed that John Sherman shall wright a 
letter: in the Townes name: unto David Michell of 
Stamfourth to Certify to him: the Townes desire of 
him: to come and keepe schoole in the towne.” Evi- 
dently they failed to secure Michell, for the next year 
Richard Norcross was chosen “ Schoole master for the 
chilldren to Read and Write and Soe much of Lattin, 
according to the order of the Court, as allso if any of 
the s¢ towne have any maidens, yt have a desire to 
learne to write yt the s¢ Richard should attend them for 
the learning off them: at allso yt he teach such as desire 
to Cast acompt, and yt the towne did promise to allowe 
the s* Richard for his imployment thirty pounds for the 
yeate,”’ 
In this instance the teacher was elected by a vote of 
the town, the town fixed the studies except Latin, and 
of that the court’s order—enough to fit for the uni- 
versity — was to be followed. Girls might be taught, 
but they were not to be admitted to the school, it seems, 
since the teacher was to “attend them.” Norcross was 
reélected annually for twenty-five years. At the end of 
that period the town seems to have adopted measures 
of economy, since they wished to hire a teacher “as 
cheap”’ as they could. In 1679 Norcross was again en- 
gaged, and that expenses might be diminished as much 
as possible, he was to teach English and Latin scholars at 
the schoolhouse for eight months, and during the four 
summer months “Latin Scholars and writers” at his 
own house. His salary was fixed at £20. The people

objected to this agreement, and as a result the school 
was kept at the schoolhouse the entire year and his salary 
raised to 425. 
A contract with Norcross for the year 1651 throws 
some light on the school. 
“ An agreement Between the Towne and Mr. Richard Norcross. 
That Mr. Richard Norcross shall attend the keeping of a schoole 
within the Bounds of Watertowne where the Towne shall appoynt. 
That he use his best endeavor to instruct all such psons as shall 
be sent unto him in Inglish writing or Lattin according to the 
Capassity of the pesons and that it is in the Liberty of any Inhabitant 
to send his sonnes or servant for a weeke or two and to take them 
away agayne at his plesure and therefore the sayd Mr. Norcross is 
to keepe a strict accounte of the nomber of weekes that every one 
Dooth Continue, And that every pson that learnesth Inglish shall 
pay 3@ a weeke and such as write or Lattin shall pay 4¢ and that 
Mr. Norcross is to give notice to the pertickler parents of theyre 
just Due according to this order and If any pson shall neglect to 
bring unto his house his full Due by the 29th of the 8th month in 52 
that then he shall bring a note of the names and the sums of theyr 
debt unto the 7 men who are hereby required to take some speedy 
Course to him to his due. This order consented to By Mr. Richard 
Norcross.” 
  When the salary was not fully paid by fees the town 
made up the shortage. 
An act of the Massachusetts general court, passed in 
1652, throws an interesting light, not only upon what the 
schools had accomplished, but upon what they were ex- 
pected to accomplish in the future. According to this 
act the number of students in the college was increasing. 
For the time being, the supply of learned men for “ mag- 
istrates, associates in courts, physicians, and officers in 
the Commonwealth, and of teaching elders in the 
churches ” was sufficient, but the young men after com- 
pleting their education were wont to “seek for and 
accept employment” elsewhere; and, as a result, it was 
becoming “ more and more difficult to fill places of most 
emminence as they are empty or wanting.” “If timely
-P-A-G-E-57
  Early Schools in New England Colonies 37 
provision be not made it will tend much to the disparage- 
ment, if not to the ruin, of the Commonwealth.” In 
this there appears nothing that would narrow the work 
of education merely to providing a learned ministry. 
In 1654 the court passed an act that took into con- 
sideration not only the moral standing of the teacher 
but also insisted upon his orthodoxy. 
“ Ordered, Forasmuch as it greatly concerns the welfare of this 
country that the youth thereof be educated not only in good litera- 
ture, but sound doctrine, this court doth therefore commend it to the 
serious consideration and special care of the overseers of the college 
and the selectmen in the several towns not to admit or suffer any 
such to be continued in the office or place of teaching, educating, or 
instructing of youth, or child, in the college or schools that have 
manifested themselves unsound in the faith or scandalous in their 
lives, and not giving due satisfaction according to the rules of 
Christ.” 
In 1671 the court for weighty reasons increased the 
fine for towns that failed to keep a grammar school from 
45, as decreed by the act of 1647, to £10; but the hesi- 
tation on the part of the constables to serve the warrants 
upon the guilty towns seems largely to have negatived 
the effect of the change. We can interpret this unwil- 
lingness to enforce the law only as evidence that the 
public was not in sympathy with it and that, with the 
new generation, educational ideals were becoming lower. 
Yet in spite of this, school laws were enacted from time 
to time, that of 1683 requiring that towns of five hundred 
families and more-maintain two grammar schools, while 
the fines imposed by that of 1647, even as amended, 
were doubled. 
But the colony was rapidly growing, in spite of the 
Indian wars, the frontier pushing westward, and many 
of the towns in its wake setting up schools. Besides 
those already mentioned, the following schools seem to 
have been established previous to 1700 within the Massa- 
chusetts Bay Colony, or in regions immediately tributary 
to it within the state. Hinsdale, p, 1232,

Plymouth Colony 
Although the colonists at. Plymouth. were tardy.in the 
setting up of schools, we have evidence that their chil- 
dren were not wholly neglected. This comes in the form 
of an indignant reply made as early as 1623, to a rumor 
that seems to have been current in England that “ their 
children were not catechised nor taught to read.” ‘This 
is not true,” it ran, “in neither part thereof: for divers 
take pains with their own as they can. Indeed, we have 
no common school for want of a fit person or hitherto 
means to maintain one, though we desire to begin.” 
There seems, however, to have been at least one school 
in the colony in 1635, for we find in a contract which the 
widow of Dr. Fuller made in receiving an apprentice, 
the agreement “to keep him at school for at least two 
years.” Such would hardly have been made had there 
been no schools. 
Yet that the instruction of children, even in the home, 
was not general, even as late as 1650, or at least that it 
was not efficient, is indicated by an action of the general 
court of the colony in that year. It runs:— 
1658. It is proposed by the Court vnto the seuerall Townshipes 
of this Jurisdiction as a thinge they ought to take into theire serious 
consideration That some course may be taken that in euery Towne 
there may be a schoolmaster sett vp to traine vp children to reading 
and writing. 
Since this same act was repeated in 1663, we must be- 
lieve that “the seuerall Townshipes” did not “take into 
theire serious consideration” this “thinge they ought.”

By this time a dozen towns had been incorporated, but 
théré-cotldnot.have beensuch_a.thing as. public 
schools. A whole generation, then, grew up without 
the advantages of instruction with which other. colonies 
were, providing their, children. 
‘An “unsuccessful attempt at establishing grammar 
schools was made in 1667, when the court decided that 
each town of fifty families shall raise £12 by tax for the 
support of the same. 
In 1670 the court opened the way for a school by 
“granting all such profits as may or shall accrue annu- 
ally to the colony from fishing with nets or seines at 
Cape Cod for mackerel, bass, or herring, to be improved 
for and towards a free school in some town in this juris- 
diction, for the training up of youth in literature for the 
good and benefit of posterity, provided a beginning were 
made within one year after the said grant.” 
The town of Plymouth, by opening a school, secured 
this income from fishery privileges, amounting to £33 
a year. The town also voted lands for the school, and 
private contributions were made. | A schoolhouse was 
built “not only for the better accommodating of the 
scholars, but also for the schoolmaster to live and reside 
ins Pe first public schoolmaster, Mr. John Morton, 
operied the school in 1671. He was “to teach the chil- 
dren and youth to read the Bible, to write, and to cast 
accounts.” The following year Mr. Corlett of Harvard 
was chosen teacher, and the school was raised to a 
grammar grade. He taught Greek and Latin, but the 
people were not so much interested in these languages, 
and in 1674 they voted that their “children be taught 
to write and cypher besides that which the country 
expects from the said school.” In this same year the 
rents from the fishery were again voted to the school 
“if a competent Number of scholars shall appear to be 
devoted thereunto, which this Court judges not to be 
less than eight or ten.” Certainly public sentiment was Plymouth Hist.

in need of an awakening. The law of 1677 shows that 
this awakening was at hand. 
This law was a marked advance over anything which 
had preceded it in the colony; and a number of towns 
availed themselves of the advantages which it offered. 
But in 1692 the Plymouth Colony was united with 
that of Massachusetts Bay, and the law of 1647, with 
its various amendments, became operative throughout 
the entire country. 
The Connecticut Colonies 
In speaking of the schools of Connecticut, the late 
Dr. Hinsdale said : — 
“No State has a more honorable ‘educational record, taken 
altogether, than Connecticut. No other of the old States can 
show such a connected series of public and private transactions 
relating to schools and education, extending from the foundation of 
the Commonwealth down to the opening of the present educational 
area, some fifty or sixty years ago. Accordingly, the State affords 
the best possible opportunity to study continuously the history of 
popular education from the feeblest beginnings.” 
Very little time was lost in getting schools under way 
after the first settlements were made in Connecticut. 
Hartford was but four years old when, in 1639, Rev. John 
Higginson opened the first; and if, as seems probable, 
one was started in New Haven the same year, schools 
there were practically coincident with the founding of 
the town. 
The only evidence we have that New Haven had a 
school at so early a date is the following record: — 
“Thomas Fugill is required by the Court to keep Charles Higgin- 
son (?), an indentured apprentice at school one year, or else advan- 
tage him as much in his education as one years schooling comes to.” 
It hardly seems probable that schooling would be 
mentioned in the formal actiorr of the court, if there
-P-A-G-E-63
  Early Schools in New England Colonies 41 
had been no schools in the New Haven Colony, where 
Fugill resided. 
Late in the year 1641 the court at New Haven con- 
sidered seriously the matter of public education, and 
voted “that a free school be set up in this towne and 
our pastor, Mr. Davenport, together with the magis- 
trates, shall consider whatt yearly allowance is meet to 
be given to it out of the common stock of the towne, 
vy allso whatt rules and orders are meet to be observed 
in} and about the same.” 
«|The first teacher of the school resulting from this 
action was Ezekiel Cheever, until 1644 at an annual 
salary of 420; but for the remainder of his service, 
which terminated in 1650, 430. It was during his con- 
nection with the New Haven school that he wrote his 
renowned Accidence. 
The serious purpose in the minds of the founders of 
these early schools is shown by the following statement 
regarding the New Haven school, which was to be 
“... for the better training up of youthe in this 
towne, that through God’s blessing they may be fitted 
for public service hereafter, either in church or com- 
monwealth.” 
But the Hartford settlers were in no way behind their 
neighbors at New Haven. Previous to 1642 a school- 
house had been erected, though that it was not always 
used for purely educational purposes may be inferred 
from the record that there were stored within it “two 
large guns, and carriages and other things belonging to 
the town.” Perhaps, however, these were but the neces- 
sary accompaniments of a school situated as was that 
at Hartford in those days. In the following year (1643) 
it was voted 
“That Mr. Andrew should teach the children in the school one 
year next ensuing from the 25th of March, 1643, and that he shall 
have for his pains £16; and therefore the townsmen shall go and 
inquire who will engage themselves to send their children; and all Steiner, p. 16,

that do so shall pay for one quarter at the least, and for more if they 
do send them, after the proportion of twenty shillings the year, and 
if they go any weeks more than an even quarter they shall pay six- 
pence a week; and if any would send their children who are not 
able to pay for their teaching, they shall give notice of it to the towns- 
men, and they shall pay it at the town’s charge; and Mr. Andrew 
shall keep the account between the children’s schooling and himself, 
and send notice of the times of payments and demand it; and if his 
wages do not come in, the townsmen must collect and pay it; or if 
the engagements come not to sixteen pounds, then they shall pay 
what is wanting at the town’s charge.” 
This record shows in what an energetic, whole-hearted 
manner those old settlers, in a town less than eight years 
old, attacked the school question. The plan was not to 
see whether there were enough generously minded people 
in the community to support the school, but to hire the 
teacher, complaints or no complaints, assure him of 
the full salary, and then go out among the people for 
the children. They drew the mark and jumped to it, 
and jumped the farther for having drawn it. 
By 1648, Hartford had outgrown its school accommo- 
dations, and it was decided in a town-meeting that “ the 
necessities of the town and the desires of many, calling 
for some provision to be made for the keeping of a 
school with better conveniency than hitherto hath been 
attained, the want whereof hath been both uncomfortable 
to those who have been employed in that service and 
prejudicial to the work under hand, which is looked as 
conducing much to the good of the present age, and that 
of the future.” At the same time it was also “agreed 
and consented to by the town that 440 shall be paid in 
the way of a rate to the townsman for the time being 
carrying on the said work. .. .” But this, it was felt, 
would be far from enough to build the kind of home 
that was needed. Therefore, provisions were made for 
receiving such private donations as any might be disposed 
to make; and it was expressly stated “that the building 
so erected shall not be diverted to any other use or
-P-A-G-E-65
Early Schools in New England, Colonies 43 
  employment, but in the way of schooling without the 
msent of the parties that shall contribute.” 
In 1650 the first codification of the Connecticut laws 
was made, and the famous articles under the titles 
“Children” and “Schools” remained upon the statute 
books for more than 150 years, slightly modified from 
time to time, so as to give them greater efficiency. 
In both the influence of the Massachusetts legislation 
is plainly noticeable. 
As may be seen from the law, education is insisted 
upon because “‘it is of singular behoofe and benefitt to 
any commonwealth.” The rights of the parents are 
recognized, but in case they neglected their duty and 
did not teach children at least enough to enable “them 
to fully read the English tongue,” and understand “the 
capital laws” a fine of 21s. was to follow. Religious 
training was also made obligatory. 
For those who could not or would not go farther, an 
opportunity was given to train children up in some 
“trade profitable to themselves and the commonwealth.” 
There was every reason in those days for an insistence 
upon a familiarity with the “capital laws.” As the life 
to come was held to depend upon a knowledge of the 
“ principles of religion,” so the present depended to an 
extent that seems almost incredible in these later days, 
upon full understanding of them. The following sec- 
tions from the capital laws of the 1650 codification 
(and there were many more of a similar nature) will 
serve to illustrate the importance of this. 
“SECTION 14. Kf any child or children above sixteen years old 
and of sufficient understanding, shall curse or smite their natural 
father or mother, he or they shall be put to death; unless it can be 
sufficiently testified, that the parents have been very unchristianly 
negligent in the education of such children, or so provoke them by 
extreme and cruel correction that they have been forced thereunto 
to preserve themselves from death or maiming. 
“SECTION 15. If any man has a stubborn, or rebellious son of 
sufficient understanding and years, viz., sixteen years of age, which

will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and 
that where they have chastized him, he will not hearken unto them; 
then may his father or mother being his natural parents lay hold 
on him and bring him to the magistrates assembled in court, and 
testify unto them that their son is stubborn, and rebellious, and will 
not obey their voice and chastisement, but lives in sundry notorious 
crimes, such a son shall be put to death.” 
It was in the same year (1650) that the Connecticut 
colony enacted its first law with reference to Indian 
education. The order was “that one of the teaching 
elders of the churches in this jurisdiction, with the help 
of Thomas Stanton, shall be desired, twice at least in 
every year to go amongst the neighboring Indians and 
endeavor to make known to them the counsels of the 
Lord, .. . and Mr. Governor and Mr. Deputy, and 
other magistrates are desired to take care to see the 
thing attended, and with their presence so far as may 
be convenient encourage the same.” 
The work among the Indians was to be evangelical, 
“wherein the glory of God and the everlasting welfare 
of the poor, lost, naked sons of Adam is so deeply con- 
cerned.” In 1654 the court asked that Homas Mynor 
send his son John to Hartford, that he might prepare 
himself in school for work among the Indians. The 
court was ready to “provide for his maintainance and 
schooling.” Schools, however, had preceded legisla- 
tion, there having been one at Guilford, founded in 
1646, and another at Farmington, taught by the parish 
minister from 1648 to 1697. References to this school 
are found in the records as late as 1736. 
The school at New Haven had been started as a Latin 
school, but by 1652 it had become quite elementary 
in character. In the early part of this year, “the Gov- 
ernor acquainted the court that he heard the school 
master is somewhat discouraged, because he hath so 
many English scholars, which he must learn to spell, 
which was never the town’s mind, and it was now 
            
         
-P-A-G-E-67
  Early Schools in New England Colonies 45 
ordered that the school master shall send back such 
scholars, as he sees doth not answer the first agreement 
‘with him, and the parents of such children were desired 
not to send them.” 
Yet it seems that the matter was not easily settled. 
Later in the year the governor again memorialized the 
court, and stated what had been done with reference to 
securing a teacher. He had written to two teachers, 
but had not yet heard from either. “ But now Mr. Janes 
has come to town, and is willing to come hither again 
if he may have encouragement.” In case one of the Hinsdale, p. 1243 
teachers to whom the governor had written should come — 
Mr. Janes was “willing to teach boys and girls to read 
and write if the town saw fit.” The town was willing 
to “allow him at least 410 a year out of the treasury, 
and the rest he might take of the parents of the chil- 
dren he teacheth by the quarter, as he did before, to 
make a comfortable maintainance.” Many were of the 
opinion that there should be two teachers, “for if a 
Latin school master come, it is feared he will be dis- 
couraged if many English scholars come to him.” 
In 1655, when the New Haven Colony contained 
seven towns, the law made ample provision for the edu- 
cation of children. In each settlement the “ officials 
were from time to time to have a vigilant eye over their 
brethren and neighbors... .” Parents and masters 
must endeavor “either by their own ability and labor, 
or by employing such schoolmasters or other helps and 
means as the plantation doth afford or the family may 
conveniently provide” to teach children and appren- 
tices ‘to be able duly to read the scriptures and other 
good and profitable printed books in the English tongue 
. and in some competent measure to understand the 
main grounds and principles of the Christian religion 
necessary to salvation.” 
Parents and masters who violated the law were to be 
fined, after due warning, 10s. for the first offence. If

Clews, p. 84. in three months after the first fine, any failed to comply 
with the law, they were to be fined 20s. If after a 
second fine “the said deputies, officer, or officers, shall 
still find a continuance of the former negligence, if it 
be not obstinacy, so that such children or servants may 
be in danger to grow barbarous, rude, and stubborn 
through ignorance, they shall give due and seasonable 
notice that every such parent and master be summoned 
to the next court of magistrates, who are to proceed as 
they find cause, either to a greater fine, taking security 
for due conformity to the scope and intent of this law, 
or may take such children or apprentices from such 
parents and masters, and place them for years —boys 
till they come to the age of one and twenty, and girls 
till they come to the age of eighteen years, with such 
others who shall better educate and govern them, both 
for the public conveniency and for the particular good 
of the said children or apprentices.” 
In this law the education of girls is included with that 
of boys, as the last lines distinctly state. 
In 1657 the court was asked to devise some means 
“to further the setting up of schools.” The answer of 
the court was “that in every plantation, where a schoole 
is not already set up and maintayned, forthwith indeavors 
shall be used that a schoolemaster be procuried that may 
attend the worke.” One-third of the teacher’s salary 
was to be paid by the town, and two-thirds by parents of 
the pupils. 
Yet the people felt the need of something better in the 
way of schools than anything which they had yet known. 
In 1659 “the Court looking upon it as their great 
duty to establish some course that (through the blessing 
of God) learning may be promoted in this jurisdiction 
as a means for fitting instruments for public service in 
church and commonwealth, did order that £40 shall be 
paid by the treasurer for the furtherance of a grammar 
school for the use of the inhabitants of this jurisdiction
-P-A-G-E-69
  Early Schools in New England Colonies 47 
and that £8 more shall be disbursed by him for procur- 
ing books . . . as suitable for this work.” 
The object was to establish a school for the entire 
New Haven Colony. A committee, with the governor 
at the head, was appointed to locate and start the school. 
Guilford offered a house for the proposed school, and 
insisted that if the “school should be settled in any other 
place .. . the like allowance should be made by that 
plantation where it falls.” 
But three years later (1662) the two Connecticut colo- 
nies of Hartford and New Haven were united; and we 
find no record that the proposed school was ever started. 
In speaking of the schools in New Haven previous to 
the union, Dr. Barnard says: — 
“Tt is due to historical truth, to ascribe to the early, enlightened, 
and persevering labors of Theophilus Eaton and John Davenport, the 
credit of establishing in New Haven, before it ceased to be an inde- 
pendent colony, @ system of education, at that time without a parallel 
in any part of the world, and not surpassed in its universal applica- 
\tion to all classes, rich and poor, at any period in the subsequent 
istory of the State.” 
nother stanch friend of education was Edward 
Hopkins, who more than once had been governor of 
Connecticut, and who left by will the greater part of his 
estate for the benefit of schools in his colony. He had 
been eminently successful, both in private and public 
life. Called to England on business, he had intended to 
return, but died there in 1657. In writing from London 
to Davenport in 1656 he says: “That which the Lord 
hath given me in those parts, I ever designed the great- 
est part of it for the furtherance of the worke of Christ 
in those ends of the earth.” 
In his will, he states : — 
“The sovereign Lord of all creatures giving in evident and strong 
intimations of his pleasure to call me out of this transitory life unto 
himself, it is the desire of me, Edward Hopkins, esq., . . . to thus Hoadley, p. gor.

Mr. John Gulick, and Mr. William Goodwin, in full assurance of their

and purpose of me the said Edward Hopkins, which is to give some 
encouragement in their foreign plantations for the breeding up of 
hopeful youths in a way of learning, both at the grammar school and 
college, for the public service of the country in future times. . . .” 
Brown, p. 46. . Two of these trustees were from the New Haven, and 
two from the Connecticut Colony. Church troubles at 
Hartford interfered with a settlement of the funds until, 
1664, when £400 was given to Hartford, £412 to New 
Haven, and £308 to Hadley, for the support of schools, 
and £100 to Harvard College. 
Appendix D. The New Haven school founded upon the Hopkins 
bequest — the well-known Hopkins Grammar School — 
was started in 1660, with Jeremiah Peck as master. He 
was ‘“‘to teach the scholars Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, 
and fit them for college.” It is evident that the school- 
master was to be a personage of some dignity, for in 
addition to 440 a year from the colony, 410 from the 
town of New Haven, and the tuition of the pupils from 
without the colony, he was to have “a settled habitation, 
not at his own charge,” and his “property and person” 
were to be exempt from taxation. When, besides all this, 
he was given one week’s vacation each year “to improve 
as the case may require,” he left the formal record that 
he was well satisfied. The people, however, were not, 
and in less than a year’s time the general court closed 
the school, asserting that “the end is not attained for 
which it was settled, no way proportionable to the charge 
imposed.” 
Steiner, p. 22. According to a report made a few months previous to 
the closing of the school, the people of New Haven took 
but little interest in it, and the fault was perhaps not all 
with the teacher. In the words of Davenport, who pre- 
sented the report :—
-P-A-G-E-71
Larly Schools in New England Colonies 49 
“The Committee for ye schoole made it a great objection against 
the keeping of it up, that this towne did not send scholars, only five 
or six; therefore, if ye would not have ye benefit taken away, you 
should send your children to it constantly and not take them off soe 
often: and, further said that he was in the schoole and it grieved 
him to see how few schollars were there.” 
After the unsuccessful attempt at a grammar school, 
George Pardee taught an elementary school at New 
Haven. Not even 460 could secure a teacher qualified 
to conduct a Latin school, though Pardee was “willing 
to do what he was able” ; but he acknowledged “he had 
lost much of what learning he formerly had obtained.” 
He was ready “to teach English and to carry them in 
lattine so far as he could; also to learn them to write. 
. . . He was also advised to instruct the youths in point 
of manner, there being a great fault found in that respect, 
as some exprest.’’ Pardee taught at New Haven for at 
least thirteen years; and, in spite of his lack of knowl- 
edge, seems to have been successful, for “ several persons 
say they find some fruit of his labors in their children 
and did desire he might go on yet longer.” 
In 1666 the united colonies were divided into four 
counties, with Hartford, New London, New Haven, and 
Fairfield the chief towns in each. Six years later the 
court granted each county six hundred acres of land “to 
be improved in the best manner that may be for the 
benefit of a grammar school... and to no other use 
or end whatsoever.” 
The act establishing the county grammar school 
reads: — 
“ And it is further ordered, That in every county there shall be set 
up and kept a grammar school for the use of the county, the master 
thereof being able to instruct youths so far as they may be fitted for 
college.” 
At this same time the teacher was exempted from mili- 
tary service and from taxes. 
Again in 1677 the law was amended. Because some

county towns failed to support the Latin school as the 
law directed “to move, excite, and stir up the attend- 
ance of so wholesome an order.” 
  “Tt is ordered by this court, That if any county town shall neglect 
to keep a Latin school according to order, there shall be paid a fine 
of ten pounds by the said county towns to the next town in that 
county that will engage and keep a Latin school in it, and so ten 
pounds annually till they shall come up to the attendance of this 
order; the grand jury to make presentment of the breach of this 
order to the county court of all such breaches as they shall find after 
September next. 
“Tt is also ordered by this court, Where schools are to be kept in 
any town, whether it be county town or otherwise, which shall be 
necessary to the maintaining the charge of such schools, it shall be 
raised upon the inhabitants by way of rate, except any town shall 
agree to some other way to raise the maintenance of him they shall 
employ in the aforesaid works, any order to the contrary notwith- 
standing.” 
If a town failed to support a school more than three 
months in the year, it was ordered to pay a fine of £5 
for every defect, to the Latin school in the county. At 
the same time the fine for failing to keep a county 
grammar school was fixed at £10. 
In 1678 the inhabitants of the village of Paquanake, 
being four miles distant from Fairfield, employed a 
teacher for their children, since the distance to the 
town school was great. They asked to be relieved 
from the taxes levied to support the school at Fairfield, 
but the town refused their request. When the matter 
was carried to the general court, the answer was : — 
“To the county court of Fairfield, to grant unto the inhabitants of 
Paquanake so much out of their county revenue by customs, fines, 
etc., so much as their rate shall come to, toward the maintenance of 
a grammar school at Fairfield, and also this court doth recommend 
it to the said court of Fairfield to improve so much of their county 
revenues as they can spare besides for the settlement and encourage- 
ment of a grammar school there.” 
With reference to elementary schools it was de- 
cided — ,
-P-A-G-E-73
Early Schools in Néw England Colonies 51 
“That every town, when the Lord shall have increased their 
families to thirty in number, shall have and maintain a school to 
teach children to read and write, on the penalty expressed in the 
former law.” 
Though the laws were stringent and the courts watch- 
ful, many were growing up in ignorance. A new law 
was enacted in 1690, because there were ‘‘many persons 
unable to read the English tongue.” The members of 
the grand jury were to visit once a year at least “each 
family they suspect” neglecting the education of “all 
children under age and servants.” Masters and parents 
found guilty were to be “fined 20s. for child or servant” 
whose teaching was being neglected. 
At the end of the seventeenth century there do not 
seem to have been, in spite of all the favorable legis- 
lation, more than the six schools mentioned in the united 
colonies of Connecticut. 
Rhode Island 
The freedom of thought, for the enjoyment of which 
Roger Williams established the Providence Plantations 
in 1636, extended itself to every phase of social as well 
as religious development; and since school legislation 
savored of coercion, none was enacted for nearly two 
centuries. Yet schools sprang up here and there within 
the present limits of the state, even in the earlier colonial 
period. The first was at Newport, when in 1640 it was 
voted that one hundred acres should be laid forth and 
appropriated for a school for encouragement of the 
poorer sort, to train up the youth in learning. 
Providence, too, in 1663, set aside 106 acres of land 
“for the maintenance of a school in this town.” But for 
the most part the schools were private enterprises. Re- 
garding them there is little record, and opinion as to 
their number and distribution is extremely contradictory. 
In one record, dated 1716, we find the statement that Am. Jour. Ed.

“there were schools of all kinds, although no uniform, 
organized system,” while Samuel, writing a half-century 
later, says : — 
“As respects schools previous to 1770, they were but little 
thought of; there were in my neighborhood three small schools, 
perhaps about a dozen scholars in each. Their books were the 
Bible, spelling book, and primer. Besides this, there were two or 
three women schools. When one had learned to read, write and do 
a sum in the rule of three, he was fit for business.” 
  In 1789 the question of public education was sys- 
tematically taken up by the citizens of Providence and 
vigorously championed by Mr. Joseph Howland. Little 
resulted, until the year 1800, when by legislative enact- 
ment each town in the state should maintain at the ex- 
pense of the town “one or more free schools for the 
instruction of the white inhabitants between the ages of 
6 and 20.” Reading, writing, and common arithmetic 
were the required subjects. Under this law, Providence 
opened free schools in 1800. The present school system 
of the state rests upon the school law of 1828. 
New Hampshire 
Until 1680 the territory of New Hampshire was a 
part of Massachusetts Bay Colony and subject to the 
provisions of the school ordinance of 1647. Although 
there are few records of schools in the earlier years, the 
fact that Boston’s first two teachers settled there — 
Parmount at Exeter, and Maud at Dover —leads us to 
believe that they were not neglected. In those of which 
we have account, girls seem to have been, for colonial 
times, particularly favored. When the town of Hampton 
engaged John Legat as schoolmaster, in 1649, it was 
for “all the children . . . both male and female (which 
are capable of learning) to write, read, and cast accounts.” 
And when Dover, in 1658, voted to raise £20 a year
-P-A-G-E-75
  Early Schools in New England Colonies 53 
for the support of a teacher, it was distinctly stated 
that it was for “all the children” within the township. 
In the first year of New Hampshire’s independence 
(1680) was passed a general school law, requiring the 
selectmen of each town to raise by assessment money 
for erecting and repairing houses of worship, parson- 
ages, and schoolhouses, and for securing a teacher for 
the town. The fine for non-compliance with this law 
was fixed at £10. During the years following this act 
other laws, both for elementary and grammar schools, 
were enacted—only to be shamefully neglected. This 
neglect led to the passage of a law in 1719 which was 
practically a copy of the Massachusetts ordinance of 
1647, with a fine of £20 instead of 45 for non-com- 
pliance. The law, with slight modifications, remained 
in force for many years. 
Maine 
Since Maine was, until as late as 1820, a part of 
Massachusetts, its school history all through colonial 
times is bound up with that of the latter state. Being 
on the frontier, schools were slow in getting a start, if 
we may judge from the frequent references in the 
records to “ presentiments ” served upon towns by the 
grand jury for failure to comply with the school ordi- 
nances. Nathaniel Freeman seems to have been the 
first teacher within the present boundaries of the state, 
he having been engaged in 1701 to “ceep scool”’ for 
all the inhabitants of York. In 1728 the town of Port- 
land opened a school with the very frank admission 
inserted in the records that it was “to prevent the 
town’s being ‘presented.’” Three years later (1733), 
whether for a similar reason or not is not stated, it 
“voted to have a scool Master for the year Insuing, 
and left it with the selectmen to provide one at the 
charge of the Town, and to order whare it should be Hall.

kept as convenient as can for the advantage of the 
whole Town.” The selectmen employed Mr. Hicks for 
42 8s. tod. for the year. For many years the settle- 
ments in Maine were in almost continued struggle with 
the Indians. But gradually schools worked their way 
eastward along the coast, and by the time of the Revo- 
lution were widely scattered. 
Yet, that the advantages had not been ideal, may be 
learned from conditions at Canaan in 1728, when Samuel 
Weston taught a class of married men. Samuel Wood 
was schoolmaster in this same town in 1796. He did 
not confine himself exclusively to the old paths, but 
introduced the newspaper into his school, which “ proved 
a very interesting document to the young.” Schools 
were in operation in Buxton in 1761, in New Gloucester 
in 1764, in Machias in 1774, and in Norridgewock in 
1779. With the passage of the Massachusetts school 
law. in 1789 the school district was fully legalized and 
remained the unit of organization for more than a 
century. Before the end of the eighteenth century 
161 towns had been incorporated within the present 
limits of the state of Maine, but in only 7 is there 
any record of a grammar school. Probably not more 
than this number had the required 100 families. 
Vermont 
This state had practically no school history during the 
colonial period. The first settlement was not made until 
1724; and during the next half-century only occasional 
schools were maintained. So far as we know, the first 
was at Guilford, in 1761. The Constitution adopted in 
1777, however, decreed “that a school or schools shall 
be established in each town by the legislature for the 
convenient instruction of the youth.”

Educational Development 61 
The expenses were, as a rule, defrayed by fees. Wick- 
ersham says : — 
“ The educational policy for 150 years after the coming of Penn 
was to make those who were able to do so pay for the education of 
their children, and to educate the children of others free.” 
Although the long struggle between the races was a 
serious drawback to educational progress in Pennsyl- 
vania, still, in some instances, national prejudice gave 
way to present needs, and the two nationalities worked 
in harmony. This was the case in the Germantown 
Academy, or Union School, which was founded in 1761. 
The leader in this movement was Christopher Sower, a 
prominent printer who took great interest in education. 
Other towns soon established schools of a similar 
character. What was perhaps the earliest book of a 
pedagogical nature to appear in the country, was from 
the pen of Christopher Dock, a master of one of the early 
Pennsylvania schools..\ Dock must have had a genius 
for reform in teaching, for as early as 1725 he was us- 
ing a blackboard in his school, a hitherto unknown thing 
in teaching, and his “ School-ordnung” was strangely 
ahead of the times. 
The Moravian schools at Bethlehem and Nazareth, 
established before the middle of the eighteenth century, 
were among the best in the country, and received pupils 
from every one of the colonies. [Colonists from Con- 
necticut, who settled in the Wyoming Valley about the 
middle of the eighteenth century, although politically 
troublesome, contributed not a little to the educational 
history of the state. In 1768 it was decided that each 
township within the settlement should reserve 960 acres 
of land for the support of “the gospel ministry and the 
schools.” In many, the schools received but a minor 
share of the apportionment; still, they were not neg- 
lected, — some in the valley even now are receiving the 
benefits of the original grant. Besides the income from

the lands, tuitions were paid, each patron contributing 
an amount determined by the number of children he 
had in school. The Wyoming Valley system of schools 
remained in force until 1834, when a state system was 
established by law. This was the beginning of free 
schools for the entire state. The law constituted each 
county of the state a school division, and each township, _ 
ward, or borough, a district. Six school directors were 
elected by the voters in each district, and two inspectors 
for each appointed by the county court. The latter 
were to visit each school every three months and report 
to the state superintendent. The law, however, con- 
tained an optional clause, which made it possible for 
districts to violate its intent until 1854, when it was 
made operative upon all school offices to enforce it to 
the letter. The available funds rapidly increased 
through favorable legislation. Normal schools, which 
were established in various parts of the state, were 
largely academic in their character, and met to a con- 
siderable extent the demands for secondary education, 
while the many colleges upon private foundation have 
adequately supplied that of a higher grade.

New Jersey, situated as it was, at about the centre of 
the early colonies, received an overflow from them all. 
The Dutch crossed the Hudson from New Amsterdam; 
the English from the New Haven Colony had but little 
farther to come, and entered in considerable numbers, 
while the Swedes from Delaware, and English and Ger- 
man settlers under Penn coming up the coast, made no 
inconsiderable contribution to its early population. Each 
of these peoples figured in the school problem, though

in some cases only to increase its complications. The 
Dutch had the first school in the field, Engelbert Steen- 
huysen having established one in 1661 or 1662, at Bergen. 
Some years later it was ordered by the council that “all 
shall be bound to pay their share toward the support 
of the preceptor and schoolmaster,” thus making it a 
publicly supported school. But public sentiment does 
not seem to have been ready for such a move, for the 
sheriff was frequently called upon to “proceed to im- 
mediate execution against all unwilling debtors.” With 
the Dutch supremacy at New Amsterdam over, the 
English proved too strong for the Hollander influence 
in New Jersey; and soon the English language and 
methods predominated in the schools. They brought 
with them their school customs, and when Woodbridge 
was chartered in 1669, one hundred acres of land were 
set apart for school purposes. But for all that, twenty 
years elapsed before a school was established. 
Newark had its first school in 1676, taught by John Murry, p. 12, 
Catlin. In the contract they bound him to “ do his faith- 
ful, honest, and true endeavor to teach the children, or 
servants of those as have subscribed, the reading and 
writing of English, and also arithmetic, if they desire it; 
as much as they are capable to learn and he capable to 
teach them within the compass of this year.” The 
Scotch-Irish and the Quakers also settled in New Jersey. 
Here, as elsewhere, schools soon made an appearance 
among them. In 1682 the Assembly of West Jersey 
granted the Island of Matinicunk, about three hundred 
acres in the Delaware River to Burlington, “ from hence- 
forth and forever hereafter for educational purposes.” In 
accordance with this grant, the revenues of the island 
are regularly used in the support of the Burlington 
schools. In 1693 and 1695 East Jersey enacted laws > 
authorizing the inhabitants of any town to meet and / 
elect three men, who should have charge of school(| 
matters. As for school tax, if any refused to pay their »

assessment, their property was to be sold to an amount 
sufficient to satisfy all school claims. 
In 1702 East and West Jersey, which had hitherto 
been separate provinces, were united and placed under 
the governor of the colony of New York. During the 
seventy-five years of this arrangement, which extended 
to the time of the Revolution, no school legislation was 
enacted, what schools there were being purely of a vol- 
untary type. Some of these, as the famous Log College 
of William Tennent at Neshameny, were grammar schools 
of no mean character; but by far the greater number 
were of a most elementary nature. About the middle 
of the century Princeton College was founded, and just 
previous to the Revolution Rutgers College at New 
Brunswick. With the close of the War of the Revolu- 
tion, much of which had been fought upon New Jersey 
soil, interest in education at once became manifest, and 
academies at once sprang up in many parts of the state. 
In 1816 a public school fund was started through the 
appropriation of $15,000, which during the next two 
years was increased to more than $100,000, and in 1824 
still further augmented by the addition each year of one- 
tenth of the state tax. Seven years later (1831) educa- 
tional progress received a setback through the abolition 
of the previously enacted free school law and provision 
made only for schools for poor children, the rest of the 
fund being given to private and parochial schools. This 
was, however, only temporary, and in 1839 the previous 
law was reéstablished, with many improvements. 
In 1845 another advance was made by the appoint- 
ment of the state superintendent of schools. With this 
move, and the establishment of a state normal school, 
educational progress through legislation ceased until 
after the Civil War. Such general progress had, how- 
ever, been made throughout the state that in 1867 a 
thoroughly modern school law was passed, which with 
some modification is in force to-day.

                      The first schoolmaster to make his way across the 
Potomac from Virginia seems to have been Ralf Crouch, 
who lived upon the Maryland side of the river from 
1639 to 1659, and “opened schools for the teaching of 
the humanities.” The sentiment there was, as it had 
been in Virginia, on the whole opposed to free schools 
for the people; so, except in the case of orphans and 
dependents, public education was little favored during 
the colonial period, and far on into that of our national 
life. Catholic missionary and parochial schools have Steiner, p. 16, 
played an important part in the educational history of 
the state; the first of the former, for the Indians, 
having been established as early as 1677. That there 
must have been something of a market for teachers at 
about this time, either for service as private tutors or in 
the schools, is evident from a statement made in 1678 
by Jonathan Boucher, rector at Annapolis. It runs :— Fiske, p. a49. 
  “. .. nota ship arrives with either redemptioners or convicts, 
in which schoolmasters are not regularly advertised for sale, as 
weavers, tailors, or other trade: with little other difference that I can 
hear of except perhaps that the former do not usually fetch so good 
a price as the latter.” 
But when one recalls the slight offences for which men 
were imprisoned at that time, due allowance will be 
made for some of these “convicts.” 
In 1696 a serious attempt seems to have been made Steiner, p. 22, 
to found county schools throughout the colony. It 
included the creation of a corporation of not to ex- 
ceed twenty members, including the governor and 
other high officials, who were to receive bequests and 
donations for the purpose, and to have general control

of the schools. To increase the fund, the colony, in 
1704, imposed duties on various imports and exports, 
such as liquor, tobacco, beef, and pork, and even negroes 
and Irish servants, though we cannot believe that the 
latter were included within the excise list for any other 
reason than to check the growth of the Catholics, 
Maryland having become by this time largely Protestant. 
Although every encouragement was given to the county 
schools, up to 1717 but one had been started, and the 
plan was given up as a failure. An occasional private 
school, however, seemed to flourish. In 1745 an adver- 
tisement of the Kent County School in Chestertown 
stated “that young gentlemen are boarded and taught 
the Greek and Latin tongues, writing, arithmetic, and 
merchants’ accounts, surveying, navigation, the use of 
globes, by the largest and most accurate in America, 
also any other parts of Mathematics, by Charles Peale. 
N.B. Young gentlemen may be instructed in fencing 
and dancing by very good masters.” Peale was the 
father of the famous portrait painter of that name. 
Another school of considerable reputation was opened 
by James Hunt in Blandensburg in 1773. He had the 
name of being an excellent teacher and possessed 
a fine library and some philosophical apparatus with 
which to illustrate his work. He was, we are told, in 
the habit of taking his pupils to the court-house, that 
they might have practical demonstrations in rhetoric 
and oratory. 
At about the beginning of the nineteenth century 
various benevolent societies for the education of the 
poor began to be incorporated. They were largely in 
control of elementary education until 1812, when a state 
fund was started through the levying of a tax on banks. 
In 1826 the first direct school tax was imposed. This, 
however, failed of any important results, since it had to 
be submitted to each county for popular approval, and 
even then was dependent upon district taxation for sup-

port. For nearly forty years the state suffered under 
the provisions of this law, each county being subject to 
the caprice of its voters, in many instances a majority 
being wedded to the idea of privately supported schools, 
with consequently disastrous results to free education. 
But in 1865, when the country was in the throes of 
the Civil War, a new law was passed, remedying the 
defects of its predecessor, and with later advances made 
in 1868 and 1872 working legislation was had under 
which the schools have prospered.

North Carolina 
Southward from Virginia there were no schools until 
after the beginning of the eighteenth century. Charles 
Griffin seems to have been the first professional teacher 
in North Carolina, he having come from the West Indies 
about the year 1705 and settled in Pasquotank County. 
He held the combined position of churchwarden and 
schoolmaster, making such a success in the latter call- 
ing that, according to the record of the time, “even the 
Quakers send their children to his school.” 
Later, Griffin was elected reader and clerk at Chowan, 
with a salary of £20 a year, and accepted the call, 
“notwithstanding the large offer” made him to remain 
at Pasquotank. 
Several schools of a semi-religious nature were estab- 
lished throughout the Carolinas during the first half of 
the eighteenth century, usually in connection with the 
churches. In 1745, North Carolina attempted to found 
a system of free schools, a law to that end being enacted ; 
but since it was only permissive, little resulted. Some- 
what later German settlers from Pennsylvania came to 
the colony in considerable numbers, in some instances Agricult. Ed.

Presbyterian denomination in the state of New York 
sent a number of missionaries into the South, with the 
result that several churches and schools in North Caro- 
lina were established. The first academy in the state 
was founded at Wilmington, about 1760. 
Many others followed in 1829, 186 having been char- 
tered. One of the most successful of them was founded 
in 1764, at Newbern. The legislature authorized the 
building of the house, and granted a charter, the first 
in the colony. The master was to be of the Church of 
England, and to have a license from the governor. To 
educate the poor, a tax of a penny a gallon was levied 
on all spirituous liquor imported into the Neuse River 
for seven years. The following year two lots were 
granted to the school; and the trustees were given the 
right to collect by law the unpaid subscriptions. 
North Carolina and Pennsylvania were the first states 
to provide for schools in their constitution. As early 
as 1817 an attempt was made to establish a very com- 
plete system of schools; but the measure failed to pass 
the legislature, and public schools received little encour- 
agement. Another futile attempt to better school con- 
ditions was made by the legislature in 1825, but it was 
not until 1839 that anything definite was accomplished. 
It provided for the division of the state into 1250 school 
districts, each with its schoolhouse and a proportionate 
part of the state literary fund (then about $100,000 
annually) devoted to its support. The bill provided for 
county adoption, but this was not very generally made. 
The plan was slightly modified in 1844, but remained 
practically the basis of school organization until after 
the Civil War. With the new problems which its com- 
pletion entailed, fresh legislation was enacted, and the 
constitution of 1868 contained a free school clause 
providing education for every child for at least four 
months of each year. Although under many diffi-

culties, substantial progress has been made since that 
time.

early legislation was special, having to do only with the 
establishment of a free school at Charleston. This 
was. made possible through a gift of money made by 
“several well disposed christians,” and sixteen com- 
missioners were appointed for founding, erecting, gov- 
erning;~and~visiting the school.” According to the 
charter the master must be a “member of the church 
of England, in sympathy and full fellowship of the 
same,” and be able-to teach Latin, Greek, and mathe- 
matics. “He was to receive os per annum out of 
the public treasury. The commissioners might appoint | 
twelve students to be taught free. Each person that 
subscribed £20 toward the school might nominate a 
“student who-would~be entitled to free tuition for five 
years: ~The fee for all other students was fixed at £4 
a year. John Douglas was the first 1 master. Provisions 
were also made (should the attendance at once demand 
it) for an usher and an assistant to teach writing, arith- 
metic, merchants’ acpounts; surveying, navigation, and 
practical arithmetic. / { He, like the head master, was to 
be paid power from the public funds and partly from 
the fees. } It was also provided that each parish might 
appoint a suitable place for a school, and receive from 
the public treasury 412 toward the building of a house.

for the Propagation of the Gospel opened a school at 
Charleston in 1711. 
‘ In 1722 a new law was enacted, which aimed at noth- 
‘ing less than schools for all. “By this act the justices 
  of these courts were authorized to purchase lands, « 
a free school, in each county and precinct, and to 
assess the expense upon the lands and slaves within 
their respective jurisdictions.” Theré were other schools 
of the same class, some founded by individual enterprise, 
some by societies. ~The oldest of these was the Sowzh 
Carolina Society, which was founded about 1737. One 
that did very much in education was the Winyaw Indigo 
Society at Georgetown. Its work dates from 1756. Its 
school was much more than a charity school. McCrady 
says, “this school for more than a hundred years was 
the chief school for all the eastern part of the country, 
between Charleston and the North Carolina line, and 
was resorted to by all classes.” The income from the 
endowment founded by this society now goes to the sup- 
port of the Georgetown high school. 
A colony from Dorchester, Massachusetts, located at 
Dorchester, South Carolina, where it remained until 
1752. In 1724 and 1734 acts were passed to establish 
a school for them. Several individuals had already be- 
,queathed considerable sums for educational purposes. 
Among these was Richard Beresford, who in 1722 left 
| 46500 for the advancement of “ liberal learning.” The 
school founded upon the bequest was situated in the 
parish of St. Thomas and-St. Dennis, near Charleston, 
and was one of the prominent schools of the state down 
to the time of the Civil War. At the close of the Revo- 
lution, South Carolina had eleven public and three 
_ charitable grammar schools, beside eight of a private 
nature. In 1826 thirty-two academies had been estab- 
lished, and there were at about the same time nine thou- 
sand pupils in the elementary schools; but these were 
entirely inadequate, and as late as 1847 a legislative com-

mittee reported that “nothing was done worthy so 
sacred a cause as education.” Yet this was more 
largely because of a lack of knowledge of how to pro- 
ceed with the work than a lack of interest in it, as con- 
siderable sums of money had from time to time been 
appropriated to school purposes. It was not until after) Agricult. Col.

1800 six academies had been founded; by 1829, sixty- 
four; and by 1840, one hundred eighty-six. This very 
rapid growth was largely fostered by legislative action 
taken in 1823, providing for the distribution of $500,000 
equally among the free schools and academies of the 
state. 
Georgia kept pace with the other Southern states by 
establishing in 1868 a system of schools “to be forever 
free to all children of the state.’ A board of educa- 
tion and a state school commissioner were established 
for its control, and its immediate supervision given to 
trustees in each district. Revenues were derived from 
a poll tax, taxes upon exhibitions, etc., and from the 
earnings of the Western and Atlantic Railway. The 
constitution made it ‘obligatory to support separate 
schools for the two races—as was common in the 
South. In 1875 there were 114,648 white children and 
55,268 black—a little less than one-half the school 
population for the former and one-third for the latter.

LATER EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE EARLY 
COLONIES ss 
  Virginia 
Tue College of William and Mary, established in col. Wm. and 
1689, fostered the educational interests of the Old Do- mary Prag 
minion. Private schools other than those which had ~~ 
preceded it were established from time to time; and in Dale 
1724, out of twenty-nine parishes, seventeen supported = 
schools of some sort. More largely, too, than in the 
Northern colonies, it was the custom of the Virginia 
planters.to procure private tutors for their children, or 
to send them abroad to be educated, so the colony was 
but little worse off educationally than were the better - 
parts of New England. Gn 1779 Thomas Jefferson 
drew up a bill providing for free schools and the train- 
ing of all free children, both male and female, in read- & 
ing, writing, and arithmetic. His whole plan included 
elementary, secondary, and higher education; but his 
ideas were in advance of the time, and the plan was not 
favorably received. In 1796 he secured the passage of 
his bill, but the act was only permissive, and conse- 
quently was without effect. 
Virginia made its first general provision for elemen- 
tary education in'1818. By this act $45,000 was appro- 
priated each year from the income of the literary fund. 
This money was given to the counties. The county 
authorities used the money for the support of charity 
schools, which were maintained in various towns. The ygniy. of v. Law

schools,” but provided for their children in private insti- 
tutions or by family tutors. As a result, popular educa- 
tion suffered. 
Minor changes were made in the law from time to 
time; but even as late as 1843 provision had been 
made, according to Governor McDowell, to give only 
sixty days’ schooling annually to one-half the indigent 
children of the state, as the grand result, “and that 
it [the law] was little more than a costly and delusive 
nullity which ought to be abolished and another and 
better established in its place.” This was attempted in 
1846, through the passage of a law establishing school 
districts, county commissions, and district trustees. But 
like so much other school legislation, the adoption of 
the law was made optional with the counties, and nothing 
like a state system of schools resulted. But after the 
Civil War, when in 1870 Virginia adopted a new con- 
stitution, a full state system of free schools was estab- 
lished, with state and county superintendents, and all the 
machinery for complete organization. And it is work- 
ing well.

District of Columbia 
When the District of Columbia was organized in 1804, 
an elaborate plan was formulated for a system of edu- 
cational institutions to comprise “schools for teaching 
the rudiments of knowledge; a college in which the 
higher branches should be taught; and a university for 
the acquisition of the highest range of studies.” The 
first of these three classes of schools has been in oper- 
ation these many years, but the favorable opportunity 
which has been awaited for the other two has never 
come. From the first the schools have been entirely

  under governmental control. Thomas Jefferson, when 
President, was chairman of the earliest committee having 
the matter in charge, and schools were opened in 1806. Columbian Univ 
In order that the tuition might be free to the “ poor P: 273: 
children,” certain taxes (on slaves, dogs, liquors, and

and are of a high degree of excellence. The many ad- 
vantages which may be derived from the government 
libraries and museums, as well as from the diplomatic 
life of the capitol, has given rise to many private and 
endowed institutions of higher instruction, both of an 
academic and professional character.

  Until 1861 this state was a part of Virginia; but in 
that year the western counties of the old state refused 
to secede from the Union, and formed a separate state state univ.

has steadily developed to the present time.

New York 
When the Dutch were forced to haul down the flag in 
the New Netherlands, the greater number of the school- 
masters either returned to Holland or removed to other 
colonies, and the Dutch schools ceased to be an im- 
portant factor in education. But the English were 
slow in setting up theirs, no definite public action 
having been taken relative to education until 1702, 
when “one able, skillful and orthodox person to be 
schoolmaster” was appointed in New York City, his 
salary of 450 being raised by public tax. That there 
had been schools during the previous years of British 
occupancy, and that their teachers had been “ orthodox” 
we may gather from a specific requirement in force that 
all teachers from abroad be licensed by the Archbishop 
of Canterbury, and those from within the colony, by the 
governor. Since the latter was as good a churchman as 
the former, we may not doubt as to the religious char- 
acter of the work, though we may wonder what the 
academic prerequisites to certification may have been. 
The school founded in 1702 was continued only for 
seven years. 
Somewhat more pretentious, and also more successful, 
was a project set on foot in 1732 to establish a school 
in New York City in which Latin, Greek, and mathe- 
matics should be taught. Public provisions were made 
for the practical support of the school and for the free 
instruction of twenty young men from the various coun- 
ties of the state, who should be recommended by the 
county officials. The justices of the Supreme Court, 
+) the rector of Trinity Church, and the mayor, recorder, 
and aldermen of the city of New York, were constituted 
a committee to visit and manage the school. They
-P-A-G-E-95
  Later Educational Development 77 
"were given power to secure and remove the teacher. 
In this committee we see the beginning of a long strug- / 
gle carried on in New York to remove the schools from 
the domination of the church and put them under state 
control. In 1754 Columbia College was founded. Up 
to the time of the Revolution, the elementary schools 
in New York City were largely fostered and supported 
by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. 
The first state legislation regarding schools seems to 
have been made in 1786, when it was ordered that un- 
appropriated lands within the state should be laid out 
in townships ten miles square, and that in each of them 
one section should be reserved for the “gospel and 
schools” and one “for promoting literature.” Special 
appropriations were also made to help academies. 
In 1795 a general school law was enacted “for the 
purpose of encouraging and maintaining schools in the 
several cities and towns of this state, in which the chil- 
dren of the inhabitants residing in this state shall be 
instructed in the English language, or be taught Eng- 
lish grammar, arithmetic, mathematics, and such other 
branches of knowledge as are most useful and necessary 
to complete a good education.” 
One hundred thousand dollars was appropriated from 
the state treasury each year for five years toward the 
partial support of the schools. Three years later (1800) 
there were 1350 public schools, with an attendance of 
60,000 pupils. At the end of the five years, for which 
this law was enacted, repeated efforts were made to 
renew it, but all failed. The people felt that some 
“religious society” should provide the opportunities for 
an education. Because many were without the means 
for securing even elementary training, the “ Public 
School Society of the City of New York” was chartered 
in 1805. This society was composed of the leading 
men of the city, and aimed to establish a free school 
“for the education of such poor children as do not be- Medical Ed.

long to, or are not provided for, by any religious 
society.” This society had control of the schools of 
New York City for forty-eight years. As early as 1784 
the state board of regents had been appointed prima- 
(rily to aid in the reconstruction of Columbia College, 
but later it was given further powers, and it has for 
more than a century now been in charge of all forms 
_of private education within the state. When, in 1812, 
Ca state superintendent of schools was appointed, thé 
‘public school system was put into his hands. 
The state was particularly fortunate in securing as 
the first incumbent of this office Mr. Gideon Hawley, 
a man of unusual ability, and to him ‘much of the suc- 
cess of subsequent school development may be ascribed. 
The school law adopted at the time of his appointment 
provided for the districting of the state for school pur- 
poses, and that the school fund be distributed on a per 
capita basis of school population. Inspection and the 
examination of teachers were made the duties of the 
township commissioners. These duties, however, so 
seriously interfered with the other functions of these 
officers, that in 1841 county superintendents were pro- 
vided for, and two years later the township officials 
were relieved of their school duties. But in 1847 the 
county superintendents were in turn deposed (reinstated 
in 1856), and thus a sad blow struck to the efficiency of 
the school system. 
In 1849 a free system of schools was provided for the 
entire state which, in spite of much opposition during 
the earlier years of its existence, even bringing about 
its abolition for a time, has stood the test and has be- 
come one of the strongest and most efficient in the 
country. Since 1867, when the final important step 
in its completion was taken, every move has been a pro- 
gressive one. 
The latest action, taken in February, 1904, was the 
creation of a school commissioner, to be elected (after

six years, the first appointment to be by the legislature) y 
by the board of regents, and intended to combine the \ 
functions of that board with those of the state super- ( 
intendent of public instruction. A. S. Draper was’ 
appointed as the first incumbent of the new office. It 
is too early as yet to say what the results of the plan 
may be, but seemingly it does away with certain defects Coeducation, 
inherent in the old dual system of administration. P. 432.

     The early colonial grammar school did thorough Appendix c. 
work in the classics, as the Harvard entrance require- 
ments show. These schools were modelled after the 
English grammar schools, with which the first colonists 
were familiar, and in which many of them had been 
trained. They differed, however, from the English 
school, in that they did not have the large endowment 
which made the English school an independent institu- 
tion. We have seen how lands and funds were set aside 
for the support of education in the colonies; but the 
income from these sources were not sufficient to provide 
a healthy support. We have also seen provisions for 
levying and collecting tax for schools, but the people 
were not always zealous in complying with these laws. 
The eighteenth century saw many new settlements made; 
and with these, new schools were opened. But in 
efficiency the schools were on the decline. The schools 
as they existed were not always those that the law pre- 
scribed. The many wars, together with the poverty and 
the increasing trouble with the mother country, were Am. Jour. Ed

P. 371 et seg. with them, and from some accounts it would seem that 
their fears were justified. In 1701 the Massachusetts 
court complained that the law was “ shamefully neglected 
by divers towns, and the penalty thereof not required.” 
This was a condition not peculiar to Massachusetts 
alone. fo remedy this growing evil, the fine for failing 
to support a grammar schoolg which in 1692 had been 
fixed at £10, was increased to 420.) Not only were 
schools neglected, but teachers were poorly prepared 
for the work of competent instruction. As a means 
toward insuring better teachers, a law was enacted 
which required every grammar school teacher to be 
approved by the minister of the town, and of the two 
nearest towns, or by any two of them. Providing 
against any abuse of this privilege, the law stipulated 
“that no minister of any town shall be deemed, held, 
or accepted to be schoolmaster of such town within the 
intent of the law.”

ring special favors were enacted. In 1692 they were 
exempted from tax; in 1692, from military service; and 
in 1699, from guard duty. It was, perhaps, the scarcity 
of teachers and the unwillingness of the people to carry 
the financial burden which the schools necessarily im- 
posed, that developed, during this period, the moving 
school. Towns that felt too poor to support a school 
alone, would often combine and hire a teacher in com- 
mon. How long the school should be taught in each 
town so combining was determined by the amount it 
had subscribed toward the teacher’s salary. 
Perhaps nothing illustrates the general trend of edu- 
cational affairs in Massachusetts during the eighteenth 
century better than the school law of 1789. This was 
a step backward when compared with previous laws; 
but as the others could not be enforced, and this was 
intended as something which could be, it comes nearer

giving the true state of affairs. Among the features of 
this law were the following :— 
1. The district system was legalized. The district 
school became a necessity because of the rural popula- 
¢ tion that was too far removed from town to share in the . 
benefits of a town school. 
\~ 2. Towns of 50 families were to support an English 
~ school at least six months during the year./ This might 
“be in one or any number of sessions. The old law had 
required the school to be in session throughout the year. 
These schools were to instruct in reading, writing, the 
English language, arithmetic, orthography, and decent 
behavior. This was an enlargement of the curriculum. 
3. Towns of 100 families were to continue schools for 
Méa length of time equal to twelve months of the year. 
4. Towns of 150 families were to support a gram- 
mar school for six months; and, in addition, a school 
se instruct children in the English language for twelve 
months in the year. These schools might be in any 
number of terms and places. 
5. Towns of 200 families were to support a gram- 
mar school and an English school each for a length 
of time equal in the aggregate to twelve months of the 
yeaa The old law had required a grammar school in 
“ach town of 100 families, but the law was continually 
violated. In speaking of this, Charles Hammond 
says :— 
“Indeed it is not certain that any locality, save Boston, has con- 
stantly complied with this provision of the ancient statutes.” 
6. All teachers were to be college graduates, and 
“shall produce satisfactory evidence thereof.” Instead 
of this qualification, however, it was sufficient to present )

most important move in the school history of the state 
came in 1837. ‘This was the creation of a state board

Connecticut /” 
In 1750 Connecticut enacted a school law which con- 
tained all the essential features of a previous law of 
1700, with some additions. The chief points were :— 
1. Towns of 70 families, having but one ecclesi- 
astical society, and ecclesiastical societies that have 70 
families shall maintain, at least, one good school for 
eleven months of the year. Towns and societies of less 
than 70 families need continue their school only one- 
half the year. 
2. Every head county town shall maintain a grammar 
school throughout the year. 
3. Toward the support of these schools, the colonial 
treasurer shall pay annually to those towns that keep 
their schools according to law, the sum of 40s. on every 
#1000 in the lists of towns. 
4. Local school funds that had been begun by the 
sale of lands in 1733, shall be a perpetual fund for the 
support of schools. 
5. In case the general tax and local funds are in- 
sufficient to support schools according to law, the 
required amount shall be raised, one-half by the tax, the Radcliffe Col.

6. The civil authorities and selectmen shall inspect 
the schools at least quarterly. They shall note the 
character of the instruction, suggest improvements, and 
report to the general assembly all disorder and misappli- 
cation of funds. The tax of 40s. on the £1000 proved 
more than the colonists could pay during the stress of 
the French and Indian War, and in 1754 was fixed at 
10s. In 1766 it was made 20s.; and was in 1767 again 
raised, this time to 40s. 
Later, Connecticut encouraged public schools and 
discouraged those of a private character. About the 
middle of the eighteenth century the “ Separatists”” had 
a large following and set up a school, “ The Shepherd’s 
Tent,” in the house of one of their adherents. The ob- 
ject of this school was to train “exhorters, teachers, and 
ministers.” Of this the assembly did not approve, and 
passed a law forbidding any one to maintain a school of 
any sort, except such as had already been provided by 
law, except by “special lycence” from the assembly. 
This law was the result of heated religious discussion, 
but it did not prevent private academies from springing 
up near the end of the colonial period. 
The first school on the order of an academy was es- 
tablished by Governor Trumbell at Lebanon in 1743. 
The school was limited to thirty pupils, and was sup- 
ported by tuition fees. For more than thirty years it 
was kept by Matthew Tisdale, a Harvard graduate, and 
its fame drew pupils even from the West Indies and the 
Southern colonies. The “Union School of New Lon- 
don” was incorporated in 1774. This school was to 
prepare for the college, and also to furnish a thorough 
English education. It had a long and useful career. 
Finally, the control of the schools passed into the 
hands of local districts or “school societies.” The 
societies were distinct from the old “ecclesiastical
-P-A-G-E-103
  Later Educational Development 85 
society” which once had control. The laws bringing 
about this change were enacted in 1795 and 1798. The 
support of the schools was to come from the income of 
the permanent funds. Each district or society was to 
appoint a committee of not more than nine competent 
persons, who were to have complete control of the ‘ 
school. The county grammar school was no longer ? 
required, but societies might, upon a two-thirds vote, 
establish a school of higher grade than elementary. It 
is not to be expected that the people were anxious for 
such schools at a time when they approved of the re- 
pealing of the old law. In 1799 the school law was 
again changed. A tax of $2 was levied on each 
$1000, but nothing was said as to the length of the 
school session. As a consequence, there was no uni- 
formity in this respect, and the schools were closed Conn. Acad. 
when the funds ran out. The new system did not prove Arts and Sci. 
successful. aoe 
As a result of the lack of school supervision the ies 
schools ran down, and Connecticut, like the other states, 5 jyo, 
found that her children were being neglected. There 
were, however, signs of an awakening. In 1825 the 
governor called attention to the insufficiency of the 
schools, and on his recommendation several towns 
adopted the Lancasterian system. In 1826 there was gues sei. sch. 
an attempt to secure state supervision of the common p. 352. 
schools, and in 1827, at Hartford, a society was organized, 
to that end. Ten years later, Henry Brainard was ap-, 
pointed secretary of the state board of education, and > Teachers’ Inst. 
the period of real, though interrupted, progress in stat& P30, 
education was begun in Connecticut. - 
At the same time was passed an act “for the better 
supervision of the common schools,” and providing for Hist. Sketches, 
o complete system of organization. In 1856 the “school 
societies” were abolished, and their powers and duties pommel 
transferred to the towns which appointed school visitors Agicalt Col. 
with duties similar to those of the school committees in p. 362.

vided for, with duties similar to those of corresponding, Theological Ea 
committees in Massachusetts. A school agent was also P: 37° 
to be appointed by the town, for each district, with gen- ae 
eral supervisory duties. 
In 1827 authority was given to form districts out of 
two or more towns —a provision arising out of necessity 
of the thinly settled regions. 
But nothing like a standardization of the schools of 
the state was brought about until 1846, when a state Teachers’ Inst. 
board of education was organized. This was later? 393 
abolished, but much progress had been made under it, 
and with the appointment in 1854 of a state superin-, Normal Schs. 
tendent, the schools were systematized and placed upon pee 
a substantial footing. County supervisors of schools p, 284, 
were authorized in 1869, and a compulsory law requir- Trans. of pupils, 
ing three months’ schooling for all between the age of P- 189 
nine and fifteen years passed in 1875. Since that time Coodicet en 
the general requirements have been much stiffened. Le

Little independent school action was taken by New Hist. Sketches, 
Hampshire after its separation from Massachusetts P: 753 
(1680) until 1789, when it was decreed that there should Bae 
be English grammar schools maintained in all “ordi- 
nary towns,” and grammar schools, in which Greek and 
Latin should be taught in all shire and half shire towns. 
In 1808 an advance was made in general organization, 
through the establishment of school committees for Libraries, 
towns and parishes, and twenty years later a super- P- 454

At about the time of this latter action (1828) a“ liter- 
ary fund” was made available for the schools. 
The next move was the appointment of a state com- 
missioner (1846), who was later deposed (1850), and his 
place taken by county commissjoners. {In 1867,a recon- 
struction was again made, and|a state board of educa- 
tion constituted, together with a state superintendent of 
education. The latter has persisted, though the former 
was abolished in 1874. Since 1848 graded schools have 
been provided for.

Vermont was settled by families from the older New 
England states, who followed the latter closely in the 
organization of schools. The first school law appeared 
on the statute books in 1782, and established the district 
system with the regular officers for its administration. 
Not until 1825 was any legislation of importance 
enacted, but in that year legal provision was made for 
the creation of a schoolfund. Two years later (1827) 
a state commissioner of public schools was established, 
empowered to recommend text-books, to superintend 
the district school committees, and to collect school 
statistics. 
In 1856 a state board of education was organized, 
and continued until 1874, when it was replaced by a 
state superintendency. All the machinery for normal 
and higher instruction is in operation.

   CHAPTER VI    
  THE GROWTH OF THE ACADEMIES    
   
     As the grammar schools throughout the early colo- 
nies declined in efficiency toward the latter part of the 
eighteenth century, a new institution was coming to the 
front, and providing a means of education that was far- 
reaching. This was the academy, the successor of 
the old grammar school, and the forerunner of the 
modern high school. From about the time of the Revo- 
lution, until the middle of the nineteenth century, it 
was the undisputed leader in secondary education; and 
although now in a sense deposed by the public high 
school, the academy has not by any means outlived its 
usefulness. In their inception, academies were of two 
general classes: (1) The local academy, which aimed to 
do little more than to supply the educational needs of 
its immediate neighborhood; and (2) the academy of a 
more pretentious type, with a course of considerable 
breadth, drawing its students from a wide field. The 
former were frequently but ephemeral, while the latter 
possessed often considerable endowment, and were es- 
tablished upon a permanent basis. The academy was 
essentially a private institution, but as will be shown 
later, in many instances received such substantial recog- 
nition from the state as to warrant its inclusion under 
the public school system. So closely did the early 
academies resemble their predecessors, the grammar 
schools, that it is not easy to determine the first, either 
Germantown as to time or place. The first, however, to become i

through the éfforts-ef-Benjamin Franklin. In Massa-

     chusetts the first--to—incorporate. was the Phillips Newark Acad. 
cademy at Andover, started in 1778, though not P- 
chartered until two-years-later— Phillips Academy at 
Exeter, oes was founded at about the 
same-time. ~Dulimmer Academy was the third to be~ 
chartered in England, being incorporated _in pe Penn. Sch, 
1782; though its history begins in 1761, when Lieu- a can 
tenant-governor Dummer bequeathed his mansion _and (N.C.) Acad. 
330_acres of land for the establishment and _ support P. 68. 
of a school. Two years later the school was opened Nazareth Acad. 
at Byfieit, Massachusetts. Because of the celebrity of ™ ae 
\ its first master, Samuel Moody, it may rightly be cdlled —_ 
‘the mother of the New England / Academy. For nineteen 
years Master Moody managed this school, and made it, 
says Charles Hammond, “the best type of an English Be.) 
grammar school that had existed on American soil since Ba (goth) ‘ 
the days of Ezekiel Cheever.” And again he says, P. 188 
“There is no doubt that the long and successful career 
of Master Moody at Byfield led to the establishment of 
the Phillips Academies and of Leicester.” 
Master Moody was indeed an exceptionally success- 
ful teacher. In 1746 he graduated from Harvard and 
began teaching the York Grammar School in the province 
of Maine. This was the only public school in the region. 
Under his instruction were educated a number of boys 
who later became famous. Governor Dummer_had 
provided in his will that the town “or parish-committee Warren Acad. 
should have control of the funds of his- school, and should P- 2. 
appoint the teacher. In looking for a master, they.de-. 
termined upon Master Moody.-He-was--appointed for _ 
life, and could_ be removed only in case the overseers of _ 
Harvard c considered_hir im “immoral and incompetent.” 
Master Moody was no less successful in training men at phillips. 
eo than he had been at York. One of his pupils _

  and Pearson were intimate friends in college; and when 
Andover was being planned, it was with the understand- 
ing that Pearson, because of his special fitness, should 
become its first master. 
The constitution of Andover limited the number of 
students to thirty, and gave preference to those who 
sought instruction “in the learned languages.” Others~ 
were not to be admitted unless the number was incom- 
plete for one month. Thirteen pupils enrolled on the 
opening day, and before the end of the month the 
full number — thirty — was in attendance, and the rule 
limiting the enrolment to that number was discarded. 
St Te Maen TRS was the third 
to_be incorporated in Massachusetts. This was in\1784. 
At that time there was not a single school in the county 
higher than the district school. Indeed the whole central 
and western parts of the state were without schools of 
high grade. When the legislature was petitioned for a 
charter, it conditioned the granting of it upon the secur- 
ing of £1000 as an endowment, in addition to the build- 
ing, which had been already secured. The endowment 
was to insure some permanency to the institution, and 
shows the caution as well as the wisdom of the legis- 
lators in the matter. The £1000 was secured and the 
charter granted within a month after me legislature had 
made that a condition. 
When the law of 1789 was ne the academies 
were ready to codéperate with the state. As_early as 
1797 they had risen to sufficient importance to call for 
the attenti tegislature:-—Beeause-others were 
seeking charters, the general assembly of Massachu- 
setts appointed a committee from its own number to 
study the question of academies, their relation to the 
state, and what the state’s attitude should be in the 
future toward them. The committee found that already 
fifteen academies had been chartered. Of this number, 
six had-received_a giant of one township eath-of state

  The Growth of the Academies 93 
land; and one, a grant of fifteen thousand acres. Of the 
remaining eight, some had been endowed by towns ‘and 
individuals, while others had noendowment. Upon the 
recommendation of the committee;-atlaw was enacted in 
behalf of academies, favorable to the policy of granting 
state aid, and considering all parts of the state entitled 
to equal grants. But before lands were granted to any 
academy in the future, there must be-a-permanent fund 
of at least $3000, provided either by individuals or com- 
munities. "The amount of land to be granted to a single 
academy was a_half to ; This amount 
was then voted to each of several academies, on condi- 
tion that they should within three years secure an endow- 
ment of $3000. The same amount was promised-to five 
counties on like conditions. 
CThis law recognized the academy as a part of the 
public school system, though the school itself was only 
a semi-public institution:) The land that was granted at 
this time was within the province of Maine. Under the 
protection of the state the academies multiplied rapidly. 
While their spread was not conducive to the growth of 
- the public school sentiment, still We must not forget that 
they came in at a time when there was a vast educa- 
tional field unoccupied, and one that would have re- 
mained unoccupied but for them. Barring the fact that 
they fostered a sentiment for private, rather than for 
public schools, their influence was good. They became 
educational centres in their respective communities, and 
broadened the life of that great class that could never 
hope to go to college; while, on the other hand, they 
were the college fitting schools. So well did they do 
their work, that the colleges were able to raise their 
entrance requirements materially. As a rule they were 
manned by young men full of zeal, who inspired the 
pupils with a desire for the best in life, and who sent 
them out to occupy positions of trust in the state and 
the church. These same teachers often brought out Am. Jour. Ed,

means of raising the standard of teaching. 
To trace the development of academies in the different 
colonies would be a long task. A general idea of their 
growth and decline may be gathered from the following 
table, which gives the incorporation of academies for a 
century, in several states. The table is necessarily in-

But the tremendous proportions to which the academy 
system had grown at the zenith of its influence is- 
shown by the table on page 96, which gives its status 
in 1850. 
Academies of the more pretentious sort were primarily 
fitting schools for the colleges, and their courses were, 
consequently, largely classical. The others devoted 
more time to the common studies. Pupils sometimes 
entered at seven years, though nine was more commonly 
considered the proper age. Discipline was strict and 
punishment severe. The following, written in 1860 by 
one of the first pupils at Phillips, Andover, will give some 
idea of the work. 
“Monitors kept an account of all a student's failures, idleness, 
inattention, whispering, and like deviation from order, and at the 
end of the week were bestowed substantial rewards for such self- 
indulgences, distributed upon the head and hand with no lack of 
strength or fidelity.”
-P-A-G-E-113
The Growth of the Academies 95 
After mentioning Cheever’s Accidence, Corderius, 
Nepos, and Virgil, with possibly some other author as 
the texts in Latin, the same writer continues : — 
“Our grammar was ‘ Ward’s,’ in which all the rules and explana- 
tions were in Latin, and we were drilled sedulously in writing this 
language far enough to get into the university. Our studies in Greek 
were very superficial. Gloucester’s Greek Grammar was our guide 
in that language, and a thorough ability to construe the four Gospels 
was all required of us to enter college. 
“Tn that day arithmetic was begun at the university. The degree 
of preparation for college and the amount of studies within it, are not 
worthy of remembrance, when compared with the means of acquire- 
ment now presented to the aspiring student.” 
If this last statement was true for 1860, how much more 
applicable is it to-day.

CHAPTER VII 
THE EDUCATIONAL REVIVAL 
AttHoucH public elementary education had been, 
after a fashion, established in the older states of the 
North by the end of the first third of the nineteenth 
century, its conditions were anything but ideal. The 
previous fifty years had been a period of intense struggle, 
economic, social, religious, and educational. The War 
of the Revolution had left the three millions of people 
composing the population, impoverished; and the diffi- 
culties with Great Britain, which continued up to the 
close of the War of 1812, made them uncertain, even of 
the future. The states west of the Alleghanies were 
being opened up, and, although full of promise for the 
future, were drawing off many of the brightest and 
most energetic young men from the Eastern states, leav- 
ing that region impoverished. During all the time, the 
schools, which are, after all, the barometer of social and 
economic success, were running down. It is true that 
colleges were springing up, and that academies were in 
their most prosperous condition, but neither of these 
institutions was for the people. The most deplorable 
features of the district system of school organization 
were dominant in the common schools. Although it 
was a time which produced great leaders, this seems to 
have been in spite of the schools, rather than because of 
them. Great teachers there were here and there, and 
good schools ; but most of the latter were within the pri- 
vate rather than the public system, and touched but a 
comparatively small proportion of the people. Schools 
of the early colonial type, which had been essentially 
H 97

  98 The Growth of the People’s Schools 
seventeenth-century transplantations from Europe, were 
outgrowing their general usefulness, and as yet the right 
thing had not been found with which to replace them. 
In 1837 the state of Massachusetts was paying but $2.73 
per pupil for the education of its children, a sum only 
about one-tenth that of the present cost, and less than 
even the poorest communities of the South are now de- 
voting to it. There was absolutely no such thing known 
as the pedagogical supervision of the schools, and not a 
public institution for the training of teachers in the 
country. Such were the educational conditions in the 
East when, in 1837, Massachusetts first organized its 
state board of education. The far-reaching influence 
of this move was due to two things: first, the fact that 
general conditions were ripe for a period of educational 
progress; and, second, that the right man was at hand 
to become its leader. Neither one could have accom- 
plished much without the other, but the combination was 
a most happy one. To it we may ascribe the tremendous 
growth in common school education which the country 
has since seen. 
Horace Mann, the first secretary of the Massachusetts 
board, was born in Franklin, Massachusetts, in 1796. 
Left fatherless at the age of thirteen years, his boyhood 
days were full of hardships. Able to attend school but 
a few weeks in each year, he was, even in those earlier 
years, impressed with the weakness of the instruction 
which was open to him, a fact that did much to spur 
him on in the unremitting warfare he waged during the 
later years of his life against just such schools as he 
had known in his youth. He was, however, an insatiate 
reader, having read the town library, a present from 
Benjamin Franklin in recognition of the name, through ; 
and even at fifteen he had acquired such a veneration 
for a book that, in his own words, “I would as soon 
stick a pin into my own flesh as into the pages of a 
book.” At about the age of nineteen years he met his

first real teacher, fitted for college in six months, entered 
Brown University, and was graduated with the class of 
1819. Both previous to his entrance to college and 
during the years of his course, Mann had taught 
a country school. When, after having studied law, 
practised successfully for several years, and after 
election to the Massachusetts legislature from Dedham, 
the town of his residence, he was appointed to the re- 
sponsible position of secretary of the state board of 
education, he was not without deep conviction on the 
subject of popular education, nor without determination 
to make the office, which was created for him, count for 
much, 
During the twelve years of his secretaryship Mr. 
Mann’s accomplishments were little short of stupen- 
dous. Never strong of constitution, they were broken 
into by occasional periods of ill health, which necessi- 
tated leisure for recuperation ; but with these few excep- / 
tions, he labored constantly for the upbuilding of the 
schools of the state. No task was too hard nor distaste- 
ful for him to undertake, if it counted toward that end. 
Everywhere that teachers could be brought together, he 
was present to address them even at the sacrifice of 
energy on his part that reduced his fragile health almost 
to the breaking point. Every important phase of the 
public school question was not only touched upon by 
him, either in his public lectures or printed reports, but 
when he felt that the occasion demanded, fought out to 
the bitter end, against all opposition. _Volumes_have 
been written upon his educational campaigns, which 
comprise some of our most important~contributions_to 
the literature of the schools. So it is necessary here 
only to point out some of the more important ones. 
First and foremost: Mann was opposed to the district 
system of organization,.characterizing the ordinance of, 
1789 which authorized it as “the most unfortunate law~ 
on the subject of common schools ever enacted in 1 the Bibliography,

state.” He urged the town unit of administration and 
“adequate supervision, for, as hé sometimes™said, he was _ 
superintendent of schools in every district of the state. _ 
Second: He urged the apportionment of an adequate 
public school fund. When he took up the work, such a 
fund existed in Massachusetts, but largely on paper. 
Now the state provides for a fund of $5,000,000, besides 
which — and it comes largely through appeals to public 
generosity made by Mann — more than $10,000,000 are 
raised annually within the state by taxation for public 
school purposes. 
Third: He was one of the prime movers in the cam- 
paign for normal schools and better trained teachers. 
Fourth: He fought strenuously for a longer school 
year. 
In 1837 one-third of the children within the state 
were without any school advantages whatsoever, while a 
large proportion of the remainder attended school but 
two or three of the winter months, or a few weeks in the 
summer. In 1839 the minimum school year for all dis- 
tricts was fixed at six months, and it has been steadily 
lengthened, until now every child in the state is forced 
to eae full years’ schooling of forty weeks each, 
Fifth: He was indefatigable in his labors for good, 
clean, sanitary schoolhouses: fit “temples of science” 
as he denominated them. The accounts which he gives 
of the school buildings, as he found them during his first 
official journeys about the state, seem incredible. Al- 
most universally in the country districts and in the smaller 
towns they were dilapidated and ill kept, if not even 
filthy, and it is to be feared that many of the larger cities 
were not without offence. During the twelve years of 
Mann’s secretaryship, $1,000,000 were put into public 
school buildings. 
Sixth: Mann urgently strove to bring about some uni- privilege of extending those years to twelve or’ 
*

    The Educational Revival IoL 
formity in text-books. At the beginning of his work, 
he found three hundred different sets in use in the state. 
Yet before its close he was able, not only to bring about 
some approximation to uniformity, but even to raise the 
general quality not a little. To-day in Massachusetts, 
as in many other states, all text-books are provided the 
pupils at public expense. 
Seventh: He was able to look beyond the schools as 
factors in education, and to recognize the public library 
as an important feature. The public library revival 
dates from the period of Mann’s secretaryship. 
The merest glance over these, a few of Horace Mann’s 
accomplished results, is enough to convince one of the 
efficiency of his service, as well as of the fact that they 
are in the exact lines along which our public school sys- 
tems, not only in Massachusetts, but in every state of 
the Union, have made their progress. 
In 1849 Mann was succeeded in the Massachusetts 
secretaryship by Barnas Sears, subsequently represent- 
ing his state in Congress for a brief period, and died, 
in 1859, as president of Antioch College in Ohio. His 
great work had, however, been accomplished in Massa- 
chusetts, and has been continued practically along the 
jlines he laid out, ever since. 
{ In 1846 special agents of the board of education were 
* \appointed, who have added much to its efficiency,, In 
1854 city and town superintendents of schools were<~ 
authorized. / In 1869 towns were empowered to expend 
public funds for the conveyance of children to schools, 
and the whole question of the consolidation of rural 
schools inaugurated. 
In 1882 the school district system, after fifty years of 
controversy, was finally abolished: one year later even- 
ing schools were authorized; and the next (1884), a free 
text-book law enacted.

requiring every town and city to employ a superintend- 
ent of schools, either singly or in combination with other 
towns. In all these moves we can see Horace Mann 
and his influence. . 
In other states in the East the educational develop- 
ments of the last half-century have been largely attempts 
to accomplish these same results. It is true that within 
each state, school growth has shown a certain individu- 
ality (certain steps in the Massachusetts plan have never 
been taken by some states and probably never will be), 
while others have taken their places. Yet these differ- 
ences do not seem to be sufficiently great to warrant a 
detailed discussion in a volume of this character, of the 
more recent growth of school systems in the older states. 
Particular facts regarding that growth are brought out 
in the topical discussions which comprise the other chap- 
ters, while the present conditions are shown in the brief

States Commissioner of Education.

  CHAPTER VIII 
EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIDDLE WEST 
ALTHOUGH the older colonies, and especially those of 
New England, furnished the battlefields upon which 
most of the great educational conflicts have been fought 
out, the conditions west of the Alleghanies were suffi- 
ciently different from those of the far East to leave plenty 
of problems for the pioneer schoolmen of the westward 
moving frontier. In the early days of the Middle West 
the settlers came from the Eastern states across the 
mountains, rather than from the Eastern countries across 
the ocean, and they had learned their lessons of popular 
education well. They already believed firmly, that the 
public school should not follow the frontier afar off, but 
that it should keep pace with it; and not infrequently 
the schoolhouse was the first public building erected 
in the settlements, preceding even the meeting-house. 
The migrations into the West were from one portion 
of a republic to another portion of that same republic, 
and those institutions which had taken long years to 
evolve in the older states were adopted, ready made, in 
the newer. The federal government encouraged this 
adoption, including in the official act which incorporated 
the Northwest Territory (from which the older states 
west of the Alleghanies were’ formed) the following 
clause : — 
“Religion, morality, and knowledge being necessary to good 
government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means 
of education shall forever be encouraged.” 
These were no idle words. Although not intended 
to be mandatory in any narrow sense, they were, never-

theless, prophetic. No other newly occupied country in 
the whole world’s history has ever seen schools estab- 
lished so nearly coincident to the first settlements, nor 
schools of so high an order in so short a time. 
In some respects the West has caught up with, and 
passed the earlier settled region to the East. Its schools 
contain a larger proportion of the children of school- 
going age, both in the elementary and secondary grades. 
It has, too, a larger total number of pupils in the schools, 
and makes a greater annual expenditure for school pur- 
poses than does any of the other geographical divisions 
studied by the commissioner of education. But these 
latter facts may be ascribed to a larger total of popula- 
tion. Secondary and higher education is particularly 
developed in the Central states, nearly one-half the insti- 
tutions in each of these classes being found there. It 
has been preéminently the home of coeducation, the first 
college in the country admitting both sexes, (Oberlin) be- 
ing within its borders, while the lower schools have been 
coeducational from the start, almost without exception. 
Ohio 
When the “ Ohio Company ” first made settlement at 
Marietta, on the north bank of the Ohio River, a 
“second New England” was planned, and schools were 
an indispensable part of the enterprise. Seemingly, the 
schoolmaster was among the first comers to the settle- 
ments; and, that he began operations immediately, may 
be judged from the fact, that in 1788, but one year after 
the town was established, $200 was sent out by Manas- 
seh Cutler, to pay him and the minister. Possibly, one 
man received it all. Within a few years four schools 
were in operation in Marietta. 
Beginning with 1802, academies were incorporated, 
and, as,settlements increased, private schools multiplied. 
Legislation aiming to encourage schools of these classes
-P-A-G-E-123
  Development in the Middle West 105 
dates from 1817, when it was made possible for any six 
or more persons to incorporate and establish a school. 
As may be supposed, none of these schools was of a 
very high grade. Of them, Barnard says : — 
“Schools worthy of remembrance between 1802 and 1820 were 
known only in the most enterprising towns. The mass of the people 
had privileges in such ‘common’ institutions of learning as might be 
expected among communities in which school teachers were toler- 
ated, but neither examined for qualifications nor encouraged for 
merit.” 
The first public school law was enacted in 1821. 
This was based on a New York ordinance, and was 
merely permissive. It provided for the districting of 
the township, school committees, and the levying of 
rate bills. Because of the failure of this law, a new 
and mandatory ohne was enacted in 1825, which may be 
regarded as the real beginning of the public school 
system in Ohio. In it provisions were made for the 
organization of districts, a county school tax (which 
continued until 1851), and the certification of teachers 
by examiners appointed by the county court of common 
pleas. Since the examiners were also to visit the schools 
at intervals, we have here the anticipation of a general 
plan of supervision. By a clause inserted in the school 
law in 1829, it was made possible for cities to organize 
separate districts apart from the township, and a few 
years later Cincinnati availed itself of the privilege, 
taking out a special charter. Almost coincident with 
the Eastern educational revival under Horace Mann in 
1837, a popular wave of public school enthusiasm 
struck Ohio. As a result, a state superintendent of 
public instruction was appointed (Samuel Lewis), and 
Calvin E. Stowe was sent to Europe to study and re- 
port upon elementary education. The school law of 
1838, which followed these moves, plainly favored the 
township, rather than the district unit of organization. Am. Jour, Ed.

  106 The Growth of the People’s Schools 
The township clerk was made virtually the superintend- 
ent of schools, with considerable authority, while further 
provisions were made for the separate incorporation of 
cities. The first real encouragement was given to 
graded schools through the passage of the “Akron 
_Law” in 1847. 
This provided for a number of primary schools as 
soon as the city funds should warrant them, and also 
for a grammar school. Two years later it was enacted 
that any village, town, or city, with two hundred or 
more inhabitants, might organize on a similar basis, if 
the people so voted. The school law of 1853 abolished 
the ‘rate,’ and made schools free. It also took the 
first step toward the consolidation of rural districts 
under the township system; though it was not until 
1885 that a law was enacted enabling township, village, 
and special school districts to unite and maintain a 
high school. What will perhaps prove to be a final 
blow to the district school within the state was dealt by 
the law of 1900, which provided for a vote on the cen- 
tralization of the schools of any township. By this act 
the township board of education must submit the ques- 
tion to popular vote upon petition signed by one-fourth 
of the citizens. Asa result of this law, Ohio is one of 
the leaders in the movement for the consolidation of the 
rural schools. 
The public schools of Ohio, especially in the cities, 
are of a high order, Cleveland having a unique and 
seemingly very successful form of organization. Small 
colleges have multiplied almost beyond all precedent; 
and, together with the State University, bring the 
facilities for higher education almost to the very doors 
of all the inhabitants. State normal schools have never 
been maintained, though departments of education in 
several of the colleges are endeavoring to supply the 
lack.

Indiana 
The first school of which we have any record within 
the present state of Indiana was taught by a French 
missionary, M. Revet, at Vincennes, in 1793... Ten years 
later there was a school at Charleston, and in 1806, 
when the first territorial legislature convened, the Vin- 
cennes University was established, primarily with special 
reference to the needs of the Indians, though only one 
ever entered. 
In 1824 a general school law was enacted, providing 
for township trustees who had power to locate districts, 
appoint sub-trustees, examine teachers, and erect school- 
houses. The method of erecting these houses was 
unique; all able-bodied male persons, except minors, 
being required to work one day each week until the 
building was completed. All such who failed to perform 
the required labor, or to pay the equivalent in building 
material, were subject to a fine of thirty-seven and one- 
half cents for each day’s default. But the law left mat- 
ters wholly in the hands of the voters, with the result 
that enterprising communities pushed schools, while 
others neglected them. 
It was at this time that attention was turned to the 
county seminary, which had a wide influence for a 
quarter of a century. The first such institution was 
Union Seminary, incorporated in 1825. By 1843 twenty- 
four similar schools had been incorporated. Some of 
them developed into higher institutions, as, for instance, 
the State University and Wabash College. Beside the 
county seminaries, were private and denominational 
schools. The first of these was Corydon Seminary, 
incorporated in 1816. Their number increased, till by 
1850 thirty-seven had been granted charters. Follow- State Univ.

from time to time; but in 1852 an ordinance was enacted, 
which contains the substance of the present school law. 
This provided for a school tax, township libraries, graded 
schools in urban centres, and the township unit of organi- 
zation. The school tax was opposed by many, and the 
supreme court declared it unconstitutional. A new law 
met the same fate, but in 1867 one was enacted that 
stood the test. 
In 1873 the state board of education began to com- 
mission high schools. These schools are entitled to send 
their pupils on certificate to the leading colleges, to 
which they are admitted without an examination. In 
1898 the board adopted a course of study for these 
schools, which in 1902 was fully revised. 
The first convention of Indiana teachers of which we 
have record was held as early as 1836. There was a 
Northern Indiana Teachers’ Institute in 1849. The 
present organization, known as the State Teachers’ 
Association, was organized in Indianapolis in 1854. In 
1856 the Jndiana School Journal commenced publica- 
tion, and until 1865 was an organ of the State Associa- 
tion. 
The common school system comprises the following 
officers : — 
Superintendent of public instruction. 
State board of education (Superintendent being presi- 
dent). 
County superintendent. 
City and town trustees. 
Township trustees. 
The university system consists of the State University 
(at Bloomington), founded as the Indiana College in 
1829, changed to Indiana University in 1838; the State 
Normal School (at Terre Haute), founded in 1865 for 
the express purpose of training teachers for the common 
schools; and the Purdue Industrial University (at La-

Illinois 
There is a tradition that in the early years of the 
eighteenth century the French established a college at 
Kaskaskia, which existed as late as 1754, but of this we 
have no certain record. The zeal of the Jesuits along 
educational lines makes it seem probable, however, that 
they would have founded schools of some sort, though 
that they had an institution worthy in any sense of the 
title College, is extremely doubtful. But it is certain 
that as early as 1783 John Seeley kept a school in an 
abandoned cabin in Monroe County, and that the school 
was continued the next year by Francis Clark. Other 
schools soon followed in the neighboring counties. As 
early as 1804 an evening school was kept by John Mes- 
senger, a surveyor and one of the makers of Peck and 
Messenger’s map of early Illinois. In the northern 
part of the state settlements were made later, the first 
school in Cook County having been started in 1816. 
The legislature of 1819 incorporated three academies, 
Madison at Edwardsville, Washington at Carlyle, and 
one at Bellville. The charters of the first two men- 
tioned provided for the free instruction of poor children, 
and also that as soon as the financial conditions should 
permit, provisions should be made for the teaching of 
girls. 
The first general school law was enacted in 1825, and 
it provided for a system of free schools. This law was 
in advance of public sentiment, as was plainly shown by 
its speedy repeal. In fact no state outside of New 
England had at the time a school ordinance which even

approximated the Illinois law of 1825 in its educational 
bearing. It provided for free schools in each county, 
the examination of teachers by district trustees, and the 
levying of local school taxes. Two years later it was 
made ineffective by a legislative provision that no per- 
son should be taxed for schools “ without his consent,” 
and Illinois lost its opportunity for educational leader- 
ship in the West. Additions were, however, frequently 
made to the school laws; and in 1840 they were fully 
revised, but with little general improvement. 
In 1840 and in 1843 there was special legislation 
with reference to academies, which were springing up 
in considerable numbers. Some few were chartered 
with the special privilege of receiving public moneys 
on the same basis as the public schools, but this prac- 
tice never became general. At about the same time 
a law was passed exempting from taxation land to the 
extent of 10 acres, owned by any educational insti- 
tution, while for colleges and seminaries the amount 
exempted was 160 acres, if actually used for school pur- 
poses, together with all buildings and equipment. 
The appointment of the first state superintendent, 
Ninian Edwards, in 1854, was followed by a law in 
1855 which abolished the “rate” and made instruction 
free. Up to this time the private and denominational 
schools had occupied the field, but now a change set in, 
and many of the academies became the free graded 
schools of their communities. Rural districts multi- 
plied, libraries were established, and schools were in 
session nearly seven months of the year. In 1889 the 
school law was thoroughly revised and, with amend- 
ments since made, the union of districts for one 
common high school has been made possible. Such 
legislation has not, however, as yet made possible such 
a union of the common schools.

affected to a marked degree both by Northern and 
Southern influences. Although as a class they are of 
a high degree of excellence, the greatest diversity and 
variation is shown, and probably Illinois shows greater 
local differences in schools than any other state in the 
Union.

There is a record that Cadillac, in the days when he 
was commander at Detroit, offered to provide funds for 
the establishment of a school at the fort for the French 
and Indians; but whether in the stirring times such was 
actually done, we do not know. If not, a mission school, 
started in 1755, seems to have been the first within the 
present state. Twenty years later (1775) Detroit had 
a schoolhouse. And beginning with about that time, 
schools were maintained in nearly all the permanent 
settlements. They were, however, of the most primitive 
sort, usually kept in log cabins, and the instruction went 
no farther than the three R’s. 
In Michigan school legislation began from the top, 
since the first enactment was to provide for a college or 
university, with a system of preparatory schools as feed- 
ers.. The former did not immediately materialize; but 
several of the latter were established, and during their 
continuance occupied the place of the academy. No 
action was taken in support of the common schools until 
1827, when a law was enacted which was almost an exact 
counterpart of the Massachusetts school ordinance of 
1647. It, however, provided for the licensing of teachers, 
and imposed a penalty of $200—certainly intended to 
be prohibitory — upon any teacher who failed to comply. 
Yet the law proved non-effective so far as any increase Coeducation,

in the number of schools was concerned, since no town 
was required to support a teacher, if two-thirds of the 
votes decided “that they would not comply with the 
law.” Two years after its passage the law was modi- 
fied in such a way as to make it more effective, and at 
the same time more nearly to meet existing conditions. 
But interest in education was not wanting. In 1830 
a ladies’ seminary was incorporated. At the same time 
Detroit had an elementary school which possessed many 
of the essential characteristics of the modern kinder- 
garten. A covered wagon was provided to take the 
children to and from the school, where a bed was in 
readiness for the sleepy little tots, if the session proved 
too long. 
With the appointment in 1836 of John Pierce as state 
superintendent of public instruction (and he was the first 
to hold such an office west of Pennsylvania), together 
with the provisions made for education in the constitu- 
tion then adopted, an era of school activity was entered 
upon. The next year a school law was passed provid- 
ing for a system of schools to be maintained, in part 
by local taxes and state appropriations, and in part by 
“rate.” This was a long step in advance; but it did 
not make free schools, nor, in fact, were such generally 
established in the state until 1869. Under the law of 
1837 schools in the poorer localities fared but indiffer- 
ently, since many parents removed their children when 
the public funds were exhausted, to avoid paying the 
fee; and, as a result, schools were often closed after a 
very brief term. In 1842 Detroit organized its schools 
upon a graded basis. And one year later, a law was 
enacted providing for a similar course in other cities. 
The union of school districts was also authorized. Under 
this law, city and town supervision of schools was stimu- 
lated and education in the larger centres of population 
prospered. That the work in the rural communities 
might also be better organized, county superintendents

were provided for in 1867; but eight years later this 
action was reversed. Since that time Michigan has been 
without school officers under that name, though the 
chairman of the board of county commissioners performs 
the duties of the office.

Wisconsin 
In 1791 James Portier opened a school at Green 
Bay. Even though his pupils were all from a single 
family, we must give him credit for being the first 
teacher within the present state of Wisconsin. He was, 
moreover, a quarter of a century ahead of his time, for 
it was not, so far as is known, until 1817 that a second 
school was established. This was at Prairie du Chien. 
Settlements were by this time springing up with some 
rapidity, and other schools soon followed. 
In 1820 Rev. Eleazer Williams, who later won some 
fame as the pretended Dauphin of France, conceived 
the idea of locating the “Six Nations” of New York at 
Green Bay. He was in the employ of the Episcopal 
Missionary Society ; and, in 1823, started a school with 
an attendance of fifty white and half-breed children, on 
the Fox River, opposite Shanty Town. A few years 
later, the society erected buildings at a cost of $9000, in 
which the children lived and were instructed. The 
school was intended especially for Indians and _half- 
breeds, who were admitted between the ages of four and 
fourteen. Branch schools were established ; but after a 
period of sixteen years, the work was discontinued, not 
however, until it had exerted a strong influence upon 
educational development in the region. 
Until 1836 the schools were all of a private nature, Coeducation,

was organized in Milwaukee. In the same year Wis- 
consin was organized as a separate territory, and adopted 
the Michigan school laws almost bodily. Then, for a 
series of years, school development was somewhat re- 
tarded by a continual tinkering with educational legisla- 
tion; but in 1849 the school code was modernized, and 
a rapid growth followed. By a legislative act in 1858, 
adjoining school districts were permitted to unite for 
the support of a common school, and, in 1875, high 
schools, supported in part by the state, were established. 
These schools are under a more or less direct supervi- 
sion of the state department of public instruction. Re- 
cently (1899) Wisconsin has provided for a system of 
county training schools for teachers, and six such schools 
have already been established. In r1gor similar county 
institutions for instruction in agriculture and domestic 
science have been made a part of the school system, the 
state being the first to make this move. Four such 
schools are in operation, each receiving $4000 from the 
state.

Minnesota 
Although mission schools for the Indians had been in 
operation in Minnesota as early as 1834, there seems to 
have been no school for white children until 1847, when 
the first was established at St. Paul. This was the re- 
sult of a philanthropic movement started by a Dr. Will- 
iamson, and furthered by the National Educational 
Society, which sent out the first teacher, Harriet Bishop. 
A log hut 1o ft. x 12 ft., which had been used as a 
blacksmith shop, was pressed into service as a school- 
house. Two years later, in the same cabin, the first 
public meeting within the territory for the purpose of 
establishing a school system was held,
-P-A-G-E-133
Development in the Middle West 115 
The first territorial legislature, convened in 1849, en- 
acted a school law, providing for a two and one-half mill 
tax for school purposes, as well as arranging for special 
levies for the erection of buildings. It also recognized 
the township as the unit of organization, and provided 
for the election of trustees, who had power to examine 
and hire teachers. Each township containing five fami- 
lies was constituted a district for school purposes. This 
might be increased to two distficts, when twice that 
number were resident within the township. This law 
remained in force until 1861. In 1851 there were thir- 
teen school districts and but five schoolhouses within 
the state, with a total enrolment of 250 pupils. Three 
years later (1854) the township unit of organization 
was replaced by the district, and the county commis- 
sioners empowered to subdivide the township. The 
question of graded schools arose early in the ’60’s, the 
town of St. Anthony (now Minneapolis) first being em- 
powered, by special legislation, to establish a graded 
system. In 1864 the act was made general in the 
schools of the state. We cannot, however, suppose 
that the teaching was of a very high order, since the 
average monthly pay of males was but $21, while for 
the females it was but $13. 
The first legislation with reference to high schools 
was passed in 1878. Under it, the sum of $400 was 
granted to each such school upon the condition that 
pupils be admitted from any part of the state, and that 
the work be of such a character as to prepare the gradu- 
ates to enter the sub-freshman class at the university. 
Provisions were also made for state inspection of the 
schools. With the exception of the period from 1879 
to 1881, this plan of state aid to the high schools has 
been continued with the best of results, in 1900 no less 
than 140 receiving $1000 each. 
Secondary schools which cannot fully comply with 
the educational requirements of the law, are given $200 
each,

Iowa 
  Primitive school conditions in the Middle West are 
graphically pictured in a description of one of the first 
schoolhouses erected within the state of Iowa. 
“Tt was built of round logs, the spaces between them chinked and 
then daubed with mud. About five feet from the west wall on the 
inside and five feet high another log was placed, and running clear 
across the building. Puncheons were then fixed on this log and in 
the west wall, on which the chimney was built. Fuel could then be 
used of any length not greater than the width of the building, and 
when it was burned through in the middle, the ends were crowded 
together. In this manner was avoided the necessity of so much 
wood chopping. There was no danger of burning the floor, as 
there was none. The seats were made of stools or benches con- 
structed by splitting a log, hewing off the splinters from the flat side 
and then putting four pegs into it from the round side for legs. The 
door was made of clapboards. On either side a piece of one log was 
cut out and over the aperture was pasted greased paper, which 
answered for a window. Wooden pins were driven into the log 
running lengthwise immediately beneath the windows, upon which 
was laid a board, and this constituted the writing desks.” 
In the early days of the territorial régime, and even 
well into the period of its state organization, such struc- 
tures were the homes of the public schools. They 
answered their purposes well, though that they were 
inexpensive is shown by the fact that in 1846, when 
Iowa was admitted to the Union as a state, the one hun- 
dred log schoolhouses then in use were valued at $125 
each. The first one was used for school purposes in 
1830, when Benjamin Jennings opened a school near the 
present site of Keokuk. Within a decade forty more 
were doing service. During territorial days little was 
done for the schools of the state by legislative enact- 
ment, though each of the three governors urged such 
action strongly. But the state constitution, adopted in
-P-A-G-E-135
  Development in the Middle West 117 
1846, was pronounced in its educational demands, It 
provided for a state superintendent, the creation of a 
public school fund, and a system of public schools based 
upon the district system of organization. An elaborate 
school law was enacted in 1858: it had been prepared by 
Horace Mann and Amos Dean, the latter, Chancellor 
of the State University, who had previously been ap- 
pointed a committee to provide a system of education 
suitable for the state. This law abolished the “rate” 
and made the schools free to all white children from 
five to twenty-one; established the office of county 
superintendent; gave aid to county institutes; author- 
ized county high schools; and made the township the 
unit of organization with provision for sub-districts. 
The county high school idea was borrowed from Jef- 
ferson. Several counties attempted to establish such 
schools, but without success. In 1870 a second county 
high school law was enacted; but the town and city high 
schools had already become so numerous that the law 
was without much influence. Guthrie County only seems 
to have made a success of it. 
In 1870 there were within the state about 7000 un- 
graded and 212 graded schools, with an average length 
of session of six months. In 1890 the ungraded schools 
alone, had doubled in number, while the graded schools 
had increased to nearly 3500. More than a month, 
too, had been added to the school year.

Missouri 
The first school within the present state of Missouri 
was taught by J. B. Trabeau in St. Louis, in 1774. His 
service in the schoolroom was an unusual one, for, 
more than forty years later, he was still conducting one State Univ.

of the two schools then in operation in the town. In 
1817 a movement was made to establish a system of 
schools in St. Louis; but the people were not ready for 
such action, and it came to naught. It was not until 
1838 that the first public school was opened there. The 
territorial constitution, framed in 1820, provided for a 
university, and schools within each township, where the 
children of the poor should be taught free. But this 
was not followed by direct legislation until 1839, and 
little activity in school matters was meantime evident. 
In that year, however, a school law was passed embody- 
ing many of the educational ideas of Jefferson, and call- 
ing for an elaborate system of state schools, with a 
university at its head. The plan was, however, imprac- 
ticable, and was soon modified. 
From this time elementary public schools increased. 
But the private and church academy had no rival until 
1853, when St. Louis opened its first high school. Dur- 
ing the Civil War schools were seriously interrupted ; 
but in 1866 a new law put them on a better foundation. 
In 1860 W. T. Harris began his work as principal of 
the St. Louis schools. His influence was far-reaching. 
Through his efforts and those of Miss Susan Blow the 
kindergarten became a part of the city school system in 
1873.

Oklahoma 
When Oklahoma was organized as a territory in 1890 
it had already a school population of upwards of thirteen 
thousand, and no delay was made in establishing a public 
school system. From the start the schools have, almost 
without exception, been under public control, there being 
at present but two private educational institutions within 
 
-P-A-G-E-137
  Development in the Middle West 119 
the territory. The first high school was established at 
Kingfisher in 1889, and has been followed by fifteen 
others, two of which are for colored pupils. Within the 
state are also a university, an agricultural college, and 
three normal schools, one of which is for the colored 
race.

Kansas 
With the promptness in school matters which has 
always characterized the West, a school was established 
at Wyandotte, now Kansas City, Kansas, in 1844, almost 
as early, that is, as the first settlers reached the state. 
This was seemingly the first school for white children, 
though at least six years previous to its establishment a 
mission school had been in operation among the Shaw- 
nee tribe of Indians; and it is quite possible that others 
also had been started. But the real beginnings of edu- 
cational growth date from 1855, when the great army of 
emigrants reached the state in their white-topped wag- 
ons, and began the making of their prairie homes. The 
vicinity of Lawrence was the earliest to be settled, and 
led in school matters during the first few years. Previ- 
ous to 1859 the schools were nearly all of a private 
character, though even two years earlier a territorial 
superintendent of public instruction had been appointed, 
and some attempts made to encourage public schools 
through legislative enactment. Some idea of the rapid- 
ity with which the country was filling up at about this 
time may be gained from the fact that Douglas County, 
the one in which the capital of the state is situated, had, 
on January 1, 1859, but 5 school districts, while six 
months later the number had increased to 30. This is 
“ characteristic of school growth in the Eastern counties. Ter. Univ.

  120 The Growth of the People's Schools 
By 1866, 222 school districts had been organized ; in 138 
of them schools were being taught at a cost of about 
$12,000. Approximately one-half of this was raised by 
taxation, while the other half came from private contri- 
bution. Since the admission of Kansas to the Union as 
a state in 1861, a complete system of public schools, 
“including common schools and schools of a higher 
grade, comprising normal, preparatory, college, and 
university departments,” has been a requirement of the 
constitution —all free to both sexes. The immense 
extent of public school lands has made it possible to ful- 
fil this requirement very perfectly, providing a public 
school for every 185 of the inhabitants. Besides others, 
a considerable number of private schools and colleges 
have been chartered. There was little demand for high 
schools until about 1870; but since that time they have 
developed rapidly, those in the larger cities being most 
excellently sustained.

Nebraska 
In matter of time, school development in Nebraska 
paralleled very closely that in its sister state Kansas. 
Within it, the first mission school was at Belvue in 1836, 
and the first public school at Brownville in 1855. 
In this latter year, the first territorial legislature en- 
acted laws establishing a school system with the state 
librarian as superintendent*of instruction. Provisions 
were made for school districts, for the certification of 
teachers, and for levying taxes. Schools of a higher 
grade were allowed, but their support was to come from 
fees and not from public funds. In 1858 the Iowa law, 
which carried with it the township unit of organization, 
was adopted almost bodily, and remained in force until
-P-A-G-E-139
Development in the Middle West 121 
1867, when it was set aside, and laws based on the Ohio 
system enacted. By this move the district system was 
established and has been in practice ever since, although 
frequent attempts have been made to change. Town- 
ship high schools were authorized by law in 1858, but 
few, if any, have been established. Beginning in 1867, 
town and city high schools were established by special 
legislative acts; and in 1873 a general law was passed 
providing for them, and also for the organization of all 
incorporated towns as separate districts. The former 
may tax themselves to the extent of 2 per cent for school 
purposes, while the rural districts may add 4 per cent to 
that amount. High schools have had a very rapid growth 
in the state. In 1888 there were 119 such schools, with 
an enrolment of 5404 pupils. Ten years later the 
numbers were 415, and 14,123 respectively. Since 1895 
these schools have been open without tuition to the 
pupils of the district schools from any part of the state.

The Dakotas 
The territory now comprising the states of North and 
South Dakota was detached from Minnesota and sepa- 
rately organized in 1861. It was first colonized in 1859, 
and in spite of the several Indian wars which occurred 
within the next few years, a school was in session in 
Bon Homme County (South Dakota) as early as 1861, 
and the educational organization of the territory was 
perfected two years later. At that time there were no 
public schools, and but a few private schools. By 1867, 
however, 29 school districts had been organized, attended 
by 421 pupils, while two private schools accommodated 
160 more. In 1878 the number of districts had increased 
to 401 with an enrolment of 7150. The territorial school Univ. of Neb.

organization included a state superintendent of public 
instruction, a county superintendent, and three directors 
for each district. In 1888 the territory was divided, and 
the two separate states admitted to the Union. At that 
time there were within the borders of North Dakota 35 
graded and 1366 common schools. Two years later the 
state opened an agricultural college and two normal 
schools. A general school law for a uniform and com- 
plete school system was among the first enactments of 
the legislature. In 1895 the governor, the president of 
the State University, and the state superintendent were 
appointed a state high school board with power to 
appoint an assistant. This board is to visit once a year 
and report on the condition of such high schools as 
maintain at least a two-years’ course and admit without 
tuition students from any part of the state. For the 
help of these schools the state set aside annually $10,000 
to be distributed as follows: To each school that main- 
tains a four-years’ course, $400; a three-years’ course, 
$300; and a two-years’ course, $200. This money is to 
be used for securing better equipment for the schools. 
The constitution provides for a large fund, fixing the 
minimum price of school lands at $10 per acre. The 
educational progress has kept pace with other industries, _ 
and the enrolment in the public schools of 1902 was 
almost 84,000. 
The educational development within the southern of 
the sister states has been similar. During its territorial 
days (1883) a university had been established at Ver- 
milion, which was continued under state control. Its 
public schools are in a flourishing condition, and, owing 
to the generosity of the state in the granting of public 
lands, well supplied. 5

  CHAPTER IX 
THE SOUTHERN STATES 
THE South, although in some parts settled early, has 
been slow in establishing an organized system of public 
schools. Int the earlier years this was due largely to a 
prevailing sentiment against such school organization, 
and in favor of private schools, or education” Within the 
family by means of tutors. As a conséqiiénce, the 
poorer classes were not educated, or were forced to 
attend the so-called “pauper school.” There were, 
however, many private schools and academies of a high 
order throughout the South, and those who were able 
to pay for educational opportunities found them in 
abundance. Especially was this true of the girls, for 
the South was a leader in the founding of seminaries 
for them. But it was not until the close of the Civil 
War that the states took up the problem of the education 
of the masses, and most manfully have they struggled 
with it since that time, in the face of odds not equalled 
in any other part of the country. Many conditions have 
made the problem difficult. First, the region, never a 
wealthy one, had been impoverished by the tremendous 
expense of a war fought within its own confines, with all 
the devastation which that means. Second, six million 
of totally uneducated colored people had been freed and 
left upon their hands for assimilation and some form of 
education. This involved the setting up of a double 
system, with all the extra expense which such a plan 
involves. Third, the population was largely rural, neces- 
sitating a greater outlay of money to bring the school to 
every child than though it had been more fully urban; 
124
-P-A-G-E-143
  The Southern States 125 
and fourth, no part of the country had so large a propor- 
tion of its population within the limits of school age as 
it; a most encouraging fact from some points of view, 
but perplexing to the financiers of public school problems. 
_Yet, previous to 1870, every Southern state had made 
constitutional and legislative provisions for free schools 
and a general system of education. een ome 
form of state control, eight had_provi unty - 
supervision, normal schools tarted_ in six, 
agricultural and industrial colleges in a still larger num- 
ber, and progress had been made in grading the schools 
in the large cities. It is true that the North had helped 
in this work through the Peabody and other funds, and 
the federal government had extended its aid; but the 
great bulk of the labor and funds came from the South 
itself. Considering that but thirty years have elapsed 
since its educational machinery was really started, mag- 
nificent progress has been made. In that time the 
percentage of total population enrolled in the schools, 
as well as of children of school age, has doubled; the 
actual number of pupils attending school more than 
quadrupled; ten days have been added to the school 
year, and the per capita expenditure for school pur- 
poses nearly doubled. ‘The South to-day taxes itself 
more heavily for its schools in_ proportion to its wealth 
than does the great Western_portion of our country, 
though not as yet quite so heavily as the North and 
East. 
Yet, in spite of the fact that the South has for a 
generation made such rapid progress in school matters, 
its start was from such a plane as to leave much to be 
done before they are upon the same footing of general 
excellence as the other portions of the country.

tucky. This was probably in the spring of 1776, when 
the colony was not more than a yearold. The following 
year there was a school at McAgee’s Station. Others 
soon followed. These earliest schools were private, and 
must have been very primitive in character. They were 
the first representatives of the “Old-field,” or “ Hedge- 
row” schools. 
The Virginia legislature made its first grant for edu- 
cation in Kentucky in 1780, by setting aside 8000 acres 
of land for an academy, as soon as it should be con- 
venient to establish one. Three years later, 20,000 
acres were granted for founding Transylvania Univer- . 
sity, and trustees were named. This was to be a state 
institution, though it was never without denominational 
flavor. Though called a university, the institution was 
little more than an academy. The first instruction in 
connection with it was in the home of Rev. David Rice, 
at Danville, in 1785. During the next ten years a num- 
ber of schools, both of elementary and secondary grades, 
were opened within the various settlements and had a 
fair attendance. In the closing years of the century, 
educational interest centred about the academies, more 
than 30 being established in different parts of the 
state. Each was given 6000 acres of land by the legis- 
lature and was also granted permission to raise $1000 
by lottery. These privileges were soon extended to each 
county for school purposes, and previous to 1820, 47 
of them had county academies in operation, some of 
which, by special enactment, had received double the 
- usual grant of land. But they led but a precarious 
existence. Educational sentiment had not yet been 
properly aroused, the people were not willing to tax 
themselves for school purposes, the lands were poorly 
managed, and the academies soon languished. But 
their failure served to turn popular attention to educa- 
tional questions, and in 1821 a committee was appointed 
by the legislature to make a study of the school systems
-P-A-G-E-145
The Southern States 127 
of the East and to suggest remedies for the difficulties in 
Kentucky. Barnard calls the report of this committee 
“one of the most valuable documents upon common 
school education that had at that time appeared.” This 
report favored the New York system, with its local taxes 
supplemented by state appropriations. Unfortunately, 
the legislature took no action, except to print the report. 
The schools of Louisville led those of the state. 
Here, in 1829, was a free school, conducted on the 
Lancasterian system. The city appropriated $2050 for 
its support for a year, but at the end of that time the 
system of fees was again adopted, and the free school 
was a thing of the past. But in 1840 tuition fees were 
abolished and the schools of Louisville made free. 
Night schools were established especially for apprentices 
in 1834. In this same year there was appointed a school 
agent, whose duty it was to visit all the schools each 
quarter and report upon their condition. His duties 
were soon enlarged, and by 1838 corresponded in gen- 
eral to those of the present city superintendent. 
A system of public schools for the state was made 
possible by a law of 1838, which included the following 
provision: a school fund, a state board of education, 
a superintendent of schools, school districts with trus- 
tees for each, county commissioners, and a local school 
tax. At this time there were 175,000 children of school 
age, of whom perhaps not more than half had enjoyed 
any school advantages. But because of opposition and 
indifference it was not until 1853 that the law was in 
operation in every county of the state. During the Civil 
War but little educational progress was made, and at its 
close the eS of negro education was added to the 
already unsolved school problems. The Peabody and 
other funds contributed throughout the North for this 
.purpose aided materially in its solution, but the burden 
of the work has been undertaken by the state. In 1866 
all taxes paid by the negroes, except such as were

the race, were devoted to these schools. A little later 
a negro poll tax was established and devoted to the same 
purpose, and since that time the state has made generous 
appropriations. In 1884 an act was passed calling for 
the election of county superintendents of schools by 
popular vote, and under the direction of these officials 
the schools have prospered. 
Better attendance, too, has been secured by the com- 
pulsory school law of 1896, which requires at least eight 
weeks of continuous attendance per year on the part of 
children between the ages of seven and fourteen.

Tennessee 
“Tt is the indispensable duty of every legislature to 
consult the happiness of a rising generation, and fit 
them for an honorable discharge of the social duties of 
life,” is a part of the preamble to the act which char- 
tered Davidson Academy at Haysboro in 1785. And 
when the North Carolina legislature passed the act, it 
also endowed the academy with 240 acres of land, and 
declared all the school’s property exempt from taxes for 
ninety-nine years. The school opened the following 
year in a stone church, where it continued for at least 
twenty years, with Rev. Thomas Craighead as teacher. 
~ This was the beginning of Nashville University. In 
1806 Congress granted to Tennessee 100,000 acres for 
each of two colleges; 100,000 acres for academies, one 
in each county, and 640 acres for every district six miles 
square for school purposes. By a single act the legis- 
lature incorporated twenty-seven boards of trustees whe 
should have charge of the academies and lands of their 
several counties. Unfortunately the public lands and ‘ ‘
-P-A-G-E-147
The Southern States 129 
funds of Tennessee were not well handled, and have 
never brought to the support of schools what they were 
  expected to contribute. The early legislation did not v 
provide for special elementary schools, as is clearly 
shown in a declaration of 1817 that colleges and acade- 
mies “should form a complete system of education.” 
In 1830, however, there was formed a definite plan for 
public instruction, beginning with the elementary work. 
At that time provisions were made for organizing school 
districts, with five trustees to each, who were to select 
county commissioners, hire teachers, and report annually 
to the commissioners, who in turn were to report to 
the legislature. * If legislative en: s_ could have 
brought it to pass, Tennessee would have had one of the 
best_school systems 1 in the e country. The amount of 
money appropriated by the state was not, however, suf- 
ficient to support the schools, and the people were not 
ready to tax themselves for the education of the children 
of others. As a result, the school term was short, and 
education was largely a private concern. At the close of 
the war each county was given supreme control of its 
own schools, with the result that in 1872 only twenty- 
nine out of ninety-three counties levied any tax. Some 
of the counties had “not a single school, either public 
or private, in operation.” The following year (1866) 
the state superintendent’s office was revived, and county 
superintendents and district directors were appointed. 
These changes met with serious opposition, but on the 
whole schools began to improve. In 1891 a law was 
passed providing for graded schools, five years being 
devoted to primary work and three to higher instruc- 
tion. e.

Arkansas 
  The first settlement in Arkansas was at Arkansas 
Post in 1686. At an early date the Jesuits had schools 
for teaching the Indians, but for the beginning of effec- 
tive education we must come down to the nineteenth 
century. In his History of Education in Arkansas, 
J. H. Shinn says that in 1820 there were private schools 
of some repute in their respective localities. The first 
school law with reference to public education was passed 
in 1829, seven years later. Batesville Academy — the 
first of many similar institutions that followed — was 
incorporated. Provisions were made for admitting the 
poor of the county without tuition, and for free instruc- 
tion for all, as soon as the funds would warrant. In 
selecting teachers and officers, and in admitting stu- 
dents, all religious tests were forbidden. This same 
tolerance was not shown, however, in the Napoleon 
Public School, chartered two years later, when it was 
distinctly stated that “ prosylites of abolition or Mormon 
doctrines” should be excluded. 
In 1843 a general school law was passed fixing the 
subjects to be taught, and providing for a county board 
of education, whose duty it should be to distribute funds, 
examine teachers, and visit the schools at least once 
ayear. Temperance legislation began in 1856, by pro- 
hibiting the sale of liquor in quantities less than forty 
gallons within three miles of Talcon Academy. This 
seems to have met with favor, and the next legislature 
extended the same provisions to six other schools. But 
conditions were not favorable for free schools. It was 
not until 1867 that an act was passed basing the sup- 
port of education upon the assessed wealth of the 
state. A general school law followed, but during the 
reconstruction period, its workings were not always 
satisfactory. However, there was some progress, and 
in 1870 more than $500,000 was expended for educa-
-P-A-G-E-149

tion, three-fifths of which came from direct taxation. 
‘At that time there were 70,000 children in school; 
but such had been the neglect of previous years, that 
the census showed 112,000 inhabitants who could not 
read, and 133,000 who could not write. With the open- 
ing of the State University at Fayetteville in 1872, and 
a branch normal at Pine Bluff three years later, was 
laid the foundation for the substantial progress that has 
since been made.

Louisiana 
Although Louisiana was settled in the earlier years 
of the eighteenth century, it was by French adventurers 
rather than by homeseekers. It is not surprising, there- 
fore, that during their entire occupancy of the region, 
we find only occasional, and not very successful, at- 
tempts to establish schools. The first was by a com- 
pany of Ursuline nuns who, together with some Capuchin 
monks, came to New Orleans in 1727. The former 
conducted a hospital as well as a school for girls, more 
than twenty pupils being in the latter in the year 1728. 
The monks seem not to have taken very extensively to 
educational work, though one of them, Father Cecil, is 
said to have been “engaged in the instruction of boys.” 
- Seemingly these schools were maintained but for a 
few years; and so far as we know, no others were pro- 
vided to take their place until after the Spanish posses- 
sion of the territory, which took place in 1761. Eleven 
years later, several Spanish teachers were sent over in 
an attempt to change the prevailing language; but so’ 
firmly was the French tongue established that the 
schools which they set up were but poorly attended. 
At no time had they more than thirty pupils, while in Ark, Col.

upward of four hundred. Educational conditions at 
about the beginning of the eighteenth century are set 
forth in the following quotation from a volume pub- 
lished in 1803. 
“There is in this country no other public institution appropriated 
to the education of youth, except a mere school established by the 
government and comprised of say fifty children almost all from poor 
families where instruction is given in French and Spanish, in read- 
ing, writing and cyphering, and the convent of nuns who have a 
few boarding pupils and keep a class for day pupils.” 
A school for boys had, however, been kept for a few 
years, but failed for lack of support. But in 1805 the 
University of New Orleans was founded. This was a 
comprehensive educational institution, on the plan of the 
University of France, and included schools of all grades 
in various parts of the territory, as well as libraries, and 
the college to be situated in New Orleans. Funds to 
the extent of $50,000 annually were to be raised by lot- 
tery. After a few years, however, the whole scheme 
was set aside as impracticable. The year following that 
of the establishment of the university saw the passage 
of a free school law which, however, remained upon the 
statute books for but a single year, and was productive 
of no results. 
At about that time legislative appropriations for 
school purposes became common, the county being 
made the custodian of such funds. 
Academies, too, were springing up, and in 1821 $800 
was appropriated for each, with the understanding that 
eight pupils should be instructed free, and be furnished 
with books, quills, and paper. 
At the same time a county tax of $1000 was author- 
ized, and $800 was allowed to each county that had not 
yet supported a school. In 1847 a free school act was 
adopted, fixing the school age at six to sixteen, granting 
at least three years of schooling to all under twenty-one,

ent, and county superintendents, with an allowance of Sch. Org. p. 195- 
$300 for the work of the latter. In 1851 the county Normal Schs. 
superintendent’s office was abolished and the schools ~ 
were put in charge of directors, who served without pay. 
The county superintendents were reinstated in 1879, 
when other provisions for schools were also made by the 
new constitution. Coeducation,

Texas 
  At an early date French and Spanish missionaries Lane,p. x. 
settled in Texas. In 1714 some of these located at San 
Antonio, building stone chapels which were so con- 
structed “as to make them serve at once for churches, ; 
schools, and dwellings, as well as forts.” These seem to 
have been the first schoolhouses. From 1620 to 1820 
the Spaniards occupied the territory and made strong 
efforts to convert and educate the Indians. There were 
schools at different places, as at El Paso about 1806, but 
it was not until 1829 that the Mexican government or- 
ganized what may be termed a public school system. 
And even then free tuition was limited to five poor 
pupils in each school. The schools were conducted on 
the Lancasterian plan. In them were taught “ read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, the dogmas of the Catholic 
religion, and all of Akerman’s catechisms of arts and 
sciences.” But the English speaking inhabitants were 
not satisfied with this provision, and petitioned for an en- 
dowment with which to establish primary schools. The 
government acceded to their wishes by granting 17,713 
acres of land to be used for this purpose. However, 
little resulted from this action, and in 1834 only four 
schools were in operation. In 1836 Texas declared its

the new republic were the chartering of an academy, a 
college, and a university. Its Congress, too, was liberal 
in the granting of lands for school purposes, as it might 
well have been, giving to each county four leagues 
(17,712 acres). 
Though the constitution of 1845, which was enacted 
when Texas was admitted to the Union as a state, made 
it the duty of the legislature to establish a system of 
public schools, nine years passed before this was done. 
The first school under the new provisions was opened at 
San Antonio. During the reconstruction period Texas 
fared better than some of the states, because she was 
silent on the question of separate schools for the two 
races, and so was free to have schools for both, while in 
some states the presence of the negroes meant separate 
systems of schools. 
As at present organized, the state school system con- 
sists of independent school districts for grammar and 
primary schools, subject to the subdivision of counties 
for community schools; municipal control of schools in 
cities, towns, and villages organized for the purpose and 
local taxation to supplement the school fund apportioned 
by the state. This latter is very large, since each county 
is in control of four leagues of land for school purposes, 
and, as new counties are organized, a like amount is 
appropriated to them from the public domain. These 
lands are usually sold to good advantage, and the public 
school fund of Texas is by far the largest of any state in 
the Union.

Mississippi 
During the greater part of the period of French and 
Spanish influence in Mississippi, there seem to have
-P-A-G-E-153
  The Southern States 135 
been neither private nor public schools in the territory, 
though private tutors were to some extent employed by 
the more wealthy of the planters. But, in the closing 
years of the eighteenth century, a colony of New Eng- 
landers made a settlement and established a number of 
schools, all of a private nature. Doubtless more would 
have arisen in other parts of the territory had it not 
been for the scarcity of properly qualified teachers. 
According to the records, many persons who aspired 
to the position had acquired such vicious habits that 
parents could not intrust their children to them. 
Mississippi early shared with the other Southern states 
the honor of providing schools for the girls. As early 
as 1801 Rev. David Kerr, assisted by his wife and 
daughters, conducted a ladies’ seminary, “the first pub- 
lic female school” in that part of the South. One year 
later, the legislature granted a charter to Jefferson Col- 
lege, this being the first public authorization of an insti- 
tution of learning. Because of lack of funds, instruction 
was not begun until 1811. In the meantime, however, 
Washington Academy had been established. The build- 
ings of this institution were transferred to the college, 
and a preparatory school serving the needs of the com- 
munity was continued. The general support of the 
school was from tuition fees, though it had the benefits 
of some public land, as well as some special assistance 
from the legislature. Up to 1820 the state had done 
nothing toward education, beyond the establishing of a 
dozen academies, and during the next twenty years the 
same policy was continued, though the number of col- 
leges and academies at the end of that period was more 
than a hundred. Most of these had a brief and unevent- 
ful history. 
Through the persistent efforts of Governor Brown, 
the first law looking toward a general school system 
was enacted in 1846. But even this was non-effective, 
since it was possible for any township to reject its pro- Mayes, p. 22,

visions if the majority of the heads of families filed a 
written protest each year. There was much opposition 
to the law, and frequent changes were made. The 
tendency was, however, toward particular laws for 
special communities, while all outside of these com- 
munities were neglected. No general system was 
established before the Civil War. 
The legislature of 1870 provided for an elaborate 
school system, making each county and each city with 
more than five thousand inhabitants a school district. 
County superintendents were to be appointed by the 
state board of education ; but several years lapsed before 
any provisions were made for paying these officers, and, 
as a result, their supervision was inefficient. The people 
at first opposed the school tax, but the records show 
a marked improvement in school conditions within a 
few years. The provisions for special districts were ex- 
tended, and in 1878 were made to include all towns of 
more than one thousand inhabitants. The schools in 
these districts are moreover less graded, and are, in 
many localities, gradually crowding out the private

  Alabama 
It is doubtful if during the French or Spanish occu- 
pancy of the present state of Alabama, schools of any 
kind were maintained, though as early as 1742 the gov- 
ernor of the province made a formal application to the 
French government for a college. About 1810, how- 
ever, John Pierce, a native of New England, set up a 
school at Boat House, on the Tenas River. This seems 
to have been the first. One year later an academy was 
incorporated at Saint Stephens, in Washington County, 
and in 1812, another at Huntsville, in Tombigbee County.

  To these the territorial legislation gave $1000. No 
other schools seem to have been founded previous to the 
admission of Alabama to the Union as a state in 1819. 
The city of Mobile was the first in the state to 
attempt to establish a system of public schools (1826). 
This was done under a special law enacted for the 
county. The law gave considerable liberty to the 
county board of school commissioners, authorizing them 
“to establish and regulate schools, and to devise, put in 
force, and execute such plans and devices for the in- 
crease of knowledge, educating youth, and promoting 
the cause of learning in said county, as to them may 
appear expedient.” 
In 1837 the legislature gave permission to the trus- 
tees of Boston Academy, which was in process of erec- 
tion, to raise $50,000 by means of a lottery. 
It also authorized a school tax, and required schools 
to be maintained outside of the city of Mobile. 
With the establishment of La Grange College by the 
Methodists in 1830, there sprang up a number of de- 
nominational schools that wielded a powerful influence 
in the state up to the Civil War. Along with these 
schools were other private academies that followed the 
same course as in other states. 
It was not until 1852 that Mobile had a system of 
graded schools, the first in the state. The old academy 
was sold, and the city established public schools. It was 
at this time that teachers were first required to hold a 
certificate. The lack of properly qualified teachers con- 
tinued to be a hindrance to progress until 1879, when 
a new law required all teachers to pass an examination 
and to furnish a certificate of moral fitness. The effect 
of this law was very beneficial. In 1850 there were 166 
academies and 1152 public schools in the state, with an 
enrolment of about 36,000 pupils. Twenty-five years 
later, the number of pupils had increased to nearly 
150,000. Clark, p. 220.

  Florida 
Unless it were in connection with some of the early 
Spanish settlements, there seems to have been no popu- 
lar interest in education in Florida until 1831, and then 
the interest seems to have been but short-lived. In that 
year some public-spirited citizens of Tallahassee, de- 
ploring the lack of schools, formed what was known 
as the Florida Educational Society. This was an in- 
stitution not unlike the American Lyceum in its organi- 
zation, though established primarily to arouse interest 
in public education. Branches of the society were 
formed in several towns of the territory, and schools 
were established; but in a few years interest in the 
project subsided, and we hear nothing more of it. 
But school legislation soon followed. In 1835 the reg- 
ister of the land office was charged with the duty of 
selecting and collecting the various lands, granted by 
Congress “for schools, seminaries, and other purposes,” 
and four years later, three school trustees were ordered 
to be chosen in each township. The township lands 
were not merged into a common fund for school purposes, 
but each township committee leased its own lands (the 
16th section), and applied the proceeds as it deemed 
wise. In some instances the money was turned over to 
a private school, and probably in no case was the school 
receiving it entirely free. In 1849 and 1850 new 
school ordinances were enacted, authorizing public 
schools for white children to be supported by county 
taxes not to exceed $4 annually for each child of school 
age. This limit would seem to have been unnecessary, 
since but two counties levied any school tax whatever. 
No further school legislation of any importance was 
enacted until 1869, when the present public school 
 
-P-A-G-E-157
The Southern States 139 
system was established. Fairly generous financial pro- 
visions were made for schools, state and county super- 
intendents appointed, and “boards of instruction” for 
each county established. The effect of this law was 
immediately felt, and under it the schools steadily im- 
proved. Whereas, in 1850, there were but 10 academies 
and 69 common schools in the state, with but 3129 pupils 
in all, and ten years later, only about double that num- 
ber, in 1873 the number of public schools had increased 
to 400, and in 1880 to 1131, with an enrolment of more 
than 40,000 pupils. The Agricultural College has now 
become the State University (1903).

CHAPTER X 
THE WESTERN STATES 
Un ike the great central portion of our country, the 
territory farther west was not occupied, though a regu- 
larly moving frontier, which took up the land for agricul- 
tural purposes and promised permanent homes from 
the very beginning. It was, rather, taken possession 
of by civilization, through a series of unrelated migra- 
tions to particular localities far removed from other 
settled territory, from which centres of population little 
frontiers were sent out, until the at first isolated settle- 
ments have left little wholly unoccupied land between 
their borders. This peculiarity of occupation, and es- 
pecially, in some instances, the reasons underlying the 
special migrations, have influenced educational develop- 
ment to some extent; but in the end, the result has been 
the same as in the Eastern portions of our country, and 
to-day we find the public school a flourishing institution, 
even in the remotest corners of this vast Western domain. 
Although, as a whole, the latter figures as the newest 
portion of the United States, it had within it, in the 
present territory of New Mexico, a permanent European 
settlement before the Pilgrim had set foot on Plymouth 
Rock, or the English flag was raised at Jamestown. 
But the old Spanish civilization of Coronado and his band, 
though permanent, was not militant, and cannot be said 
to have influenced, in any important way, subsequent 
educational development of any portion of the country. 
Of the migrations of English-speaking people into the 
Western territory, the first of any magnitude was that of 
the Mormons to the region of the Great Salt Lake.

  142 The Growth of the People’s Schools 
This was a religious pilgrimage made by home-seekers, 
and the resulting institutional and educational life was 
that of a community realizing its permanency from the 
start. In this respect it differed from the next two cru- 
sades, that to California in 1849, and to Colorado ten 
years later, which were for gold. The resulting settle- 
ments showed, in the most glaring way, all the peculiari- 
ties of the mining-camp. In the earlier years, when the 
population lacked women and children, and when what 
few families there were, were ready to set out at a 
moment’s notice for more promising fields, schools were 
few, and in many instances those that existed were 
hardly worthy of the name. Yet such conditions have 
been typical of almost the whole mountain region of the 
West, for the gold fevers of ’49 and ’59 have broken out 
in nearly every one of its states and territories. At first, 
only those who failed in the quest for gold turned to agri- 
culture and allied pursuits. These proved the richness 
of the fields, and others were not slow to follow their 
example. Now, in spite of its vast mineral wealth, the 
whole region, with the exception of some few restricted 
portions, figures primarily for its agricultural resources. 
Its schools rank high. Although but thinly settled, the 
region enrolls a greater percentage of its school popula- 
tion (five to eighteen years) in its schools than does any 
other part of the country. In its expenditure, too, for 
school purposes it is generous, exceeding any other 
portion of the country in per capita outlay, and nearly 
doubling that for the country as a whole. No group of 
states has a better reason to be proud of its educational 
accomplishments than those of the Rocky Mountain 
region. 
New Mexico 
The Spanish settlements in New Mexico date from 
the latter part of the sixteenth century, and without 
doubt, mission and parochial schools were maintained 
 
-P-A-G-E-161
The Western States 143 
  from nearly the beginning. In the year 1806 we have 
the record of 480 children in such schools at Santa Fé 
alone. A quarter of a century later, parochial schools 
were being maintained in several other towns within 
the territory. These schools had many of the charac- 
teristics of those of southern Europe. In the summer 
months the session began at 6 a.m., and in the winter but 
an hour later. The instruction was largely in Spanish. 
No attempts seem to have been made to supplement 
the private schools with those upon a public foundation 
until 1854-1855. Then the legislature passed a per- 
missive public school law, which, however, required the 
action of the counties to become operative. There, the 
popular vote was so overwhelmingly against the schools 
(5016 against, 37 for), as to leave no doubt as to the 
feeling of the people on the question of public schools. 
About ten years later, a new law was enacted, provid- 
ing for a school in each settlement, and levying a tax 
of 50 cents for each pupil. The probate judge was to 
perform the duties of the county superintendent, and 
the justice of the peace was authorized to employ the 
teachers, and require the boys and girls to attend school 
from November to April. It seems, however, that the 
law was not always enforced, for during the school year 
of 1870-1871 only 1.4 per cent of the total population 
was enrolled in the schools ; within the next decade the 
enrolment had increased to 3.98 per cent, while at the 
same time 19.67 per cent of the total population of 
the entire country was attending school. Since that 
time both the laws and the school conditions have im- 
proved. The population of New Mexico is largely a 
Spanish-speaking people, a fact which introduces con- 
ditions into the public school problem which have been 
hard to meet, and which have retarded the progress of 
public education within the territory.

Colorado 
  Previous to the year 1859, but little was known of the 
territory included within the present state of Colorado. 
The “forty-niners,” en route to the gold fields in Cali- 
fornia, had crossed it in large numbers, and an occa- 
sional fur trader or explorer had visited it; but to the 
great mass of the people it was known only as an unde- 
fined portion of “The Great American Desert.” 
But in 1858 a band of miners, known in history as 
Green Russell’s party, spent some months in the moun- 
tains of the region just west of the present city of Den- 
ver; and their reports of gold brought great crowds of 
prospectors to the new country during the following 
year, almost paralleling the stampede of a decade before 
to the regions of the Golden Gate. Although at first but 
few of the settlements contained any women and chil- 
dren, still a few schools were established, the first being 
at Boulder, in 1860. 
By 1861 the increase in population had been such as 
to justify Congress in establishing the territory of Colo- 
rado, the region having previously been a part of Kan- 
sas. At the time, the number of school children within 
the boundaries of the entire territory were hardly suffi- 
cient, had they been gathered into one district, to have 
formed a first-class district school. Nevertheless, there 
was an excellent beginning. The schools of Colorado 
remained in a somewhat chaotic condition until 1870. 
The school funds were frequently misappropriated. 
The legislature of 1870 made provisions for a State 
School of Mines. The act also provided that the gov- 
ernor, by and with the consent of the legislative assem- 
bly, “should appoint a suitable person to the office of 
State Superintendent, who shall hold the office for two 
years at a salary of $1000 per year.” Since that time 
educational development has been rapid, and the schools

compare favorably with those in any portion of the 
country.

Utah 
In Utah schools are practically coincident with the 
coming of the Mormons, the vanguard of whom arrived 
in the summer of 1847. The main body, however, did 
not reach the valley of the Great Salt Lake until the 
following year. At first, education among these settlers 
was almost entirely of an elementary nature, since there 
were many, even among the adults, who were unable to 
read or write. The necessity of educating the adults in 
the rudimentary subjects was so great that a parents’ 
school was soon established at Salt Lake City, for the 
heads of families and for the training of teachers. 
Brigham Young was one of the pupils in this school. 
Primary and other schools were immediately opened in 
all the principal settlements, and for those who were 
sufficiently advanced, classes were organized as early as 
the winter of 1848-1849 for the study of ancient and mod- 
ern languages. The.Frontier Guardian reports (May 30, 
1849) that “there have been a large number of schools, 
the past winter, in which the Hebrew, Greek, Latin, 
French, German and English languages have been 
taught successfully.” 
During the ’60’s the various denominations were 
busy establishing mission schools, and were making much 
progress educationally. This was the means of arous- 
ing the Mormons, and some attempts were even made 
at higher education. 
In 1870 schools were private, and the support came 
from “fees”; 20,772 pupils were enrolled in the 262 
private schools. There was, however, at this time, a

growing feeling that education should be free. Ten 
years later the legislature arranged for school districts, 
anda tax for building and repairing schoolhouses. It 
had been the custom, in Mormon settlements, to keep 
the school in the meeting-house. When this new law 
came into operation, many of these became the school- 
houses of their respective districts. Interest in public 
education continued to grow, and in 1885 the schools 
were being largely supported by public funds. By 1890 
it was strong enough to occupy largely the field that 
once had been held by the denominational schools. 
The constitution of 1895 prohibits both the legislature 
and the state board of education from prescribing the 
text-books to be used in the common schools, and re- 
quires the metric system to be taught throughout the 
state. In 1902 Utah ranked twelve in the enrolment 
of school population.

California 
As early as 1767 the Spanish had made settlements 
within the boundaries of the present state of California, 
and before the close of the century had established 
eighteen missions, mostly in the central and southern 
parts. These were in charge of a considerable number 
of priests. Although it is known that in connection 
with these missions, schools were kept, they have left no 
permanent record of themselves. Of their exact char- 
acter we are consequently ignorant. For the beginning 
of anything even suggestive of an educational system, 
we must come down almost to the middle of the nine- 
teenth century. 
In the fall of 1847 the town council of San Francisco 
built a small schoolhouse. Soon after, the citizens met

territory. This, however, does not mean that there were 
no educational privileges, since parochial schools existed 
in some numbers. But, within a few years of the pas- 
sage of the law, considerable interest was manifested in 
public schools. Districts were organized in the thinly 
settled regions, the towns established graded systems, 
and in 1880 about 10 per cent of the population was en- 
rolled in the schools. This was, roughly speaking, one- 
half of the school population. Since that time the 
improvement has been gradual, educational conditions 
in Arizona being now well up to those of similar por- 
tions of the country.

Nevada 
The constitution of 1864 made provisions for a school 
system, beginning with the primary school and extend- 
ing through all grades to the State University. In 
addition to those provisions which were commonly made 
in state constitutions at that time, a paragraph was in- 
cluded, requiring all teachers to take an oath to support 
and protect the Constitution and government of the 
United States, “bearing true faith, allegiance and loy- 
alty to the same,” etc., and also the following : — 
“And I do further solemnly swear or affirm, that I have not 
‘ought a duel, nor sent or accepted a challenge to fight a duel, nor 
fen a second to either party, nor in any manner aided or assisted 
_such duel, nor been knowingly the bearer of such challenge or 
ceptance, since the adoption of the constitution of the State of 
‘vada, and that I will not be so engaged or concerned, directly or 
Mirectly, in or about any such duel during my continuance in

Whether or not it was difficult to find teachers wha 
fulfilled all the requirements I cannot say; but there was 
in 1870-1871 only a trifle over 7 per cent of the popula- 
tion in school. At the end of the next decade the per- 
centage had doubled. The State University first opened 
at Elko in 1874. The work at first was that of an ordi- 
nary academy. Two years later it was moved to Reno, 
and was organized with six departments. There being 
no normal school in the state, the university offers 
courses for teachers. Because of local conditions, Con- 
gress allowed the land granted for an agricultural college 
to be used in establishing the College of Mines. With 
a population of about 43,000, the schools of Nevada are 
necessarily few. Of a total enrolment of 7295 for the 
year 1901-1902, all but 4.7 per cent were in the public 
schools.

  Oregon 
In Oregon the earliest settlements were along the 
Columbia and Willamette rivers. Hardly had they been 
made when missionaries arrived, and schools were put 
in operation. As early as 1835, a Mr. Edwards started 
a school near the village of Chamfrog, and the next 
year twenty-five children were brought in from Fort 
Prairie and placed in his school ; but sickness broke out 
among them, and the enterprise was abandoned. Still 
other schools soon sprang up throughout the settle- 
ments. The people were interested, not only in the 
education of their own children, but in that of the 
Indians, and several mission schools were established. 
Among others, was the so-called Indian Manual Labor 
School, established in 1842 by the Methodists, which 
was later merged into the Oregon Institute. From
-P-A-G-E-167
         
  The Western States 151 
1840 to 1850 a number of small schools were opened ; 
some were under the control of the Catholics, others, 
of the Protestants. Through the pioneer work of these 
denominational schools, here, as in the other states, the 
public system was evolved. The first move in that 
direction on the part of the legislature was made in 
1849, when it was voted that the interest arising from 
the money received from the sale of school lands should 
be used for public school purposes. This was only a 
small step, but it made possible the first public school 
at Oregon City in the year following. The legislature 
of 1853-1854 made further provisions for schools by 
devoting certain fines to their support, and providing 
for a local tax. While these laws were being enacted, 
and the work of establishing the school system was be- 
ing pushed, the different denominations continued the 
building of academies and colleges. Both the Agricul- 
tural College (chartered in 1868) and the State Univer- 
sity (opened in 1876) were private institutions before 
they came under state control.

Washington 
The early history of this state parallels very closely : 
that of Oregon. Previous to its organization as a sepa- 
rate territory in 1863, private and denominational schools 
were to be found here and there in the various settle- 
ments, and there is every evidence that the colonists 
were deeply interested in educational matters. A school 
law had been passed as early as 1854; and from that 
time schools had been supported, at least in part, by 
taxation. In 1870, 4760 pupils were in attendance at 
154 public schools, while 358 were served by private 
schools. Ten years later (1880) the figures for public

schools were 9827 and 415. Since that time the growth 
has been rapid, especially during the decade of the 
’90’s, when the mining interest in Alaska brought many 
thousands of people to the state. The first high school 
was established at Seattle in 1883, and although there 
were but four others in the state previous to 1890, they 
have since multiplied rapidly, 76 being reported for the 
year 1902. Many of these, however, have but a two 
years’ course. The State University at Seattle is in a 
flourishing condition, maintaining departments of law 
and science, as well as arts. Six other institutions of 
college grade, as well as three normal schools, are situ- 
ated in various parts of the state.

Soon after the organization of Idaho as a separate 
territory in 1863, the general supervision of the public 
schools was delegated to the comptroller, who for many 
years performed the duties without special compensa- 
tion. County superintendents and the rural district 
officers were a part of the general organization. The 
early growth of schools was, however, slow. In 1866 
there were but 14 within the territory, with an enrol- 
" ment of 436 pupils, while as late as 1874 the comptroller 
states that at Boise City, the capital and largest city, 
“during the whole of 1873 there was no school, and but 
four months taught during 1874.” But in 1880 the 
whole number of schools within the territory had in- 
creased to 155, attended by 6758 pupils. From this 
time the growth has been steady. The State University 
at Moscow was established in 1892. Normal schools 
are maintained at Albion and Lewiston.

A territorial school law passed in 1864 provided for 
schools only as they could be maintained from an income 
from certain fines and by rates. It was not until 1874 
that a definite school tax was levied. As early, however, 
as 1868, 25 districts had been organized, with about 700 
pupils in attendance. A decade later the numbers had 
increased to 103 and 2384. The offices of state superin- 
tendent and county superintendent have been maintained 
from the beginning, as well as the usual district officers. 
The rapid growth of schools during the last two 
decades is shown by the fact that in 1890 there was an 
enrolment of 16,980. Itis at present upwards of 45,000. 
The first high school within the state was established 
in 1883 at Butte. But one other, at Anaconda, had its 
origin in the same decade, the remaining 20 dating their 
birth since 1890. The higher institutions are a State 
University, a College of Agriculture and the Mechanics’ 
Arts, and a normal school.

Educational development within this state is a thing 
of the present generation. With but the meagrest 
population up to the time of its organization as a terri- 
tory, and for years afterward, and even this of an 
extremely unstable character, schools were slow to take 
root, in 1870 the total number being nine (4 public, 
5 private), with an enrolment of 305. 
Ten‘years later but 20 teachers were employed in the 
territory, and it was not until 1880 that the number of 
50 was reached, doing service in 36 different schools and 
instructing 2000 pupils. At various times in its early 
history, the auditor, the governor, and the librarian served 
as territorial superintendent of schools, though in 1880 State Univ.

a separate office was created. In 1886, what is now the 
State University was established, and this is the only 
higher institution of learning in the state, its normal 
department serving as the training school for teachers. 
The state constitution of 1890 made generous provision 
for public education, and the schools, though few in num- 
ber, are well conducted, those in the larger towns com- 
paring favorably with similar systems in the more 
thickly populated portions of our country.

  CHAPTER XI gee 
DEVELOPMENTS IN ELEMENTARY EDUCATION 
Tue changes in the organization and administration 
of our common schools, from the time when nearly all 
the population was rural, and each school consequently 
had few pupils, to the conditions of to-day, when nearly 
one-half the people of the country live in towns of con- 
siderable size, and approximately eighteen million chil- 
dren are going through the machinery of elementary 
education, are very great.. The curriculum has under- 
gone many modifications, and received additions, until it 
has lost all resemblance to its former self. But the most 
important changes have come in the direction of school 
organization. 
A simple machine will do its work even though 
clumsily constructed; but increase its complexity, and 
only the most careful adjustment of all its parts_will 
prevent lost motion, or even a total breakdown. ‘\Dhe

   documents respecting the conditions of the schools 
themselves; but from the testimony of men who were 
educated in the common schools prior to _1800, it ap- 
pears that the course of i tion wi: - 
ing, reading, writing, and_the.. elements of arithmetic. 
t is impossible, however, to suppose that the curricu- 
lum remained the same for all the years of our educa- 
tional history prior to that date, and we have evidence 
that certain schools made considerable advances during 
the colonial period.

Massachusetts Bay, Plymouth, Connecticut, New Am- 
sterdam, and New Sweden, fuere reading, writing, reli- 
gion, and capital laws.) No Bs ore ree is made to spelling, 
which was undoubtedly taught in connection with the 
reading, nor to arithmetic, although the latter was 
taught in many of the schools. With the eighteenth 
centuryNthe curriculum underwent considerable modi- 
fication.~\Religion and laws were taught together. 
Arithmetic was generally added, although this was 
done earliest in the schoolS-of the Middle states, and 
in the South, rather than in New England, and seems _ 
to have had more time devoted to it there. The earliest 
mention we find of the subject was for Pennsylvania in 
1683, when a contract was made with one, Enoch Flower, 
providing that the children under his tutelage should 
“learn to read, write and cast accounts.” 
It seems probable that ciphering was not generally 
introduced in the schools of New England until some- 
time after 1750, though beginnings had been made 
earlier. Nearly all the records dating after that time 
mention it in some form, along with reading and writing. 
Just when spelling differentiated itself from reading 
cannot be said with definiteness; but in the records it 
is not often mentioned as a separate subject until after 
the Revolution. Dzlworth’s Speller,a very popular text-

book, came into favor at about this time, or a little 
earlier, and may have had something to do with the 
move. This book contained a little English grammar, 
and we may infer that this subject received some atten- 
tion from this time on. 
{ For many years, in fact until well into the nineteenth 
   century, even slighter changes were made in the organi- 
zation of the elementary schools than in their course of 
study. They were everywhere, even in the larger 
towns, ungraded, the system consisting of little more 
than a collection of isolated district schools, each with 
its own separate building. But as time went on, it 
became cheaper in thickly populated parts to erect 
school buildings with several rooms; and even the 
not over-pedagogical school committees soon recognized 
an advantage in the plan of roughly classifying the 
pupils, and of placing the younger ones under a certain 
teacher, while the older were assigned to others. Here 
is an anticipation of the present graded system. Yet 
not for many years, not, in fact, until after the middle 
of the century, when the city superintendent of schools 
became a factor, was the division more minute than into 
-the primary and the grammar schools. 
Speaking of the primary schools of Boston in 1856, 
Superintendent Seaver in his report says : — 
“The furniture was scanty, only little movable armchairs for the 
pupils to sit in. There was of course no study in the modern sense 
of the term. The principle of gradation had not been recognized, 
and promotions from one teacher’s room to another was unknown. 
It is true that each teacher had six classes, but this meant that her 
children began with their A BC’s with her, and stayed in her room 
until they were ready for admission to the grammar school, because 
their teachers were unwilling to impoverish their first classes by 
parting with their most brilliant pupils.” 
In many places conditions were not, however, so seri- 
ous as this. Boston was unusually late in providing 
for primary schools, and always, until comparatively

  lately, provided for them but poorly in comparison with 
what was done for the grammar and secondary grades. 
‘The next stage, although it was omitted in many _ 
places, was that of the insertion of the so-called inter- 
mediate school between the primary and the grammar, 
by cutting off one or two years from each, and devoting 
separate rooms to their work. The step from this plan 
to that of full yearly grading, with separate rooms and 
teachers for the work of each year, was not a long one; 
and, after the appointment of the city superintendent of 
schools, was rapidly taken. In most of the older cities 
of the East it came in the decades from 1840 to 1860, 
though rather in the later than in the earlier years of 
that period. Now the plan is universal, no city nor 
town, in the country, large enough to make it profitable, 
being without its full system of graded schools. In the 
vast majority the number of annual steps—or grades — 
is eight, though there are exceptions to the rule. In 
some few but seven rooms precede the high school, 
while in a considerably larger number (and most of 
them are in the New England states) there are nine. 
This may be due, at least in part, to the earlier legal 
school age, which generally prevails in that part of the 
country. 
This graded system of city schools has been the nec- 
essary result of the growth of urban population. On 
the whole, it has worked well, though through it the 
student who varies materially from the normal type is 
made to suffer. In the freer organization of the un- 
graded school, it was possible for the bright student to 
go a little faster, and the dull ones a little slower than 
his fellows, without giving rise to any serious adminis- 
trative problems. In the grades this is not so easy, pro- 
motion being usually an annual event, and the stages 
rigidly differentiated, making it necessary that the same 
pace be kept by all. Some schools—though altogether 
too few—are already trying the plan of semi-annual
-P-A-G-E-175
Developments in Elementary Education 159 
promotion, with the greatest success, except for its 
strain upon the administrative machinery. No doubt 
the number of schools doing so will greatly increase 
within the next few years. The experiment of individ- 
ual instruction has also been tried; and, although 
the plan has many strong points, it has not been suc- 
cessfully put into practice in any large city. 
The course of study in the elementary school has 
undergone so many changes in its evolution from its 
ungraded state to its present complexity as to make it 
seem unwise to trace it in detail. 
The following suggested programmes, the first taken 
from the report of the National Educational Association 
Committee on Rural Schools, and the second, from that 
of the Committee on Elementary Education, show the 
best thought of the present day. The first is for an 
elementary school, admitting of a threefold division of 
students.

  Developments in Elementary Education 163 
Of the subjects upon these programmes, nearly all are 
the common branches, and need no detailed discussion. 
Upon the latter, appear manual training, sewing, or 
cookery, and natural science. This last subject, though 
emphasized by Pestalozzi, Froebel, and other European 
writers upon pedagogical subjects, gained no hearing in 
this country until after the middle of the nineteenth cen- 
tury. In 1855 Agassiz invited all the public school 
teachers who so desired to attend his lectures given 
at Boston to the undergraduates of Harvard College. 
Among the teachers who availed themselves of this 
invitation was Lucretia Crocker, who in 1878 became 
supervisor of natural history work in the schools of 
Massachusetts. About 1870 Professor Alpheus Hyatt 
opened his laboratory to all who wished to come. Satur- 
day morning classes were formed, with him as instructor, 
and the valuable collection of the Natural History Mu- 
seum placed entirely at their disposal for demonstrative 
work. 
As a result of these lectures, an organization known 
as the “ Teachers’ School of Science in New England,” 
was formed in 1871. At first this school was entirely 
under the direction of Mr. John Cummings, but in 1878— 
1879 the pecuniary responsibility and control was as- 
sumed by Mrs. Pauline Agassiz Shaw and Mrs. Hemen- 
way. Through its instrumentality nearly ten thousand 
specimens were carried into the public schools of the 
Eastern states, and the publication of a series of science 
guides — much used even in the schools of to-day — was 
begun. Gradually the nature-study movement made its 
way to every part of the country, no system of schools 
of any pretension failing to be influenced by it. 
Its latest turn is in the direction of agricultural instruc- 
tion. In point of size, our elementary school system has 
grown almost beyond the possibility of full comprehen- 
sion, as is shown by the following table taken from the 
report of the commissioner of education :— Chapter XIX.

166 The Growth of the People's Schools 
  From this table it will be seen that more than one- 
fifth of our total population is enrolled in the public 
schools; and that nearly three-fourths of all those of 
school age are so enrolled; that the number of days 
attended by those enrolled has increased nearly one- 
fourth in thirty years; that the total number of school- 
houses has more than doubled in that time ; and that the 
value of all school property has more than quadrupled. 
Nothing that I can say can emphasize so strongly as do 
these figures our national educational development. 
Perhaps the most important move of the last quarter- 
century in elementary education is that which has given 
us the kindergarten as a part of our public school sys- 
tem. Except with the Dutch in the New Netherlands, 
the beginning schools had always been less fully provided 
for in the older states than had those of higher grades, 
and the kindergarten movement has been slow in gain- 
ing headway. But it has now reached every part of the 
country, and is of almost incalculable benefit. ‘The 
introduction of the kindergarten into the United States 
was due to the efforts of Mrs..Elizabeth.Peabody..of 
Boston, Massachusetts, who in 1867 visited Germany 
for the purpose of studying the Froebelian methods, and 
returned the next year to devote her life to their intro- 
duction in this country. Within the next two years sev- 
eral private kindergartens were established in Boston, 
and in 1870 the first one of a public nature, in one of 
the city school buildings, though not supported by the 
school appropriations.) Two years later a private kinder- 
garten was opened in New York City, under the direc- 
tion of Mrs. Boelte — now Mrs. Kraus-Boelte, one of the 
leaders ever since in the kindergarten movement — who 
had studied in Germany with the widow of Froebel, the 
founder of the system. Other private kindergartens, 
most of them of a charitable nature, were at about this 
time started in different parts of the country. But 
the action which more than any other paved the way
-P-A-G-E-183
Developments in Elementary Education 167 
  for the kindergarten as a part of our public school 
system was taken by the school board of St. Louis at 
the solicitation of Dr. W. T. Harris, then the superin- 
tendent of the St. Louis schools. It was the establish- 
ment in 1873 of a public kindergarten under full control 
of public authorities, and bearing the same relation to 
the public schools of the city as did any other of the 
grades* The experiment was a success, and others 
were rapidly added, demonstrating beyond a doubt the 
efficiency of the kindergarten as a part of a city school 
system. In 1874 the number in St. Louis was 4; in 
1875, 12; in 1876, 30; in 1877, 40; and in 1878, 53. It 
is now 125. Regarding the experiment at St. Louis, 
Miss Blow, who was the gratuitous teacher of the first 
kindergarten there, says, it “ was a crucial one, and had 
it failed, it would have been difficult to prevail upon other 
cities to introduce the kindergarten into their schools. 
* There were many ready arguments against such an 
innovation: the argument from expense: the argument 
based upon the tender age of the kindergarten children: 
the argument that kindergartens would spoil the chil- 
dren and fill the primary grades with untractable pupils: 
the argument that only rarely endowed and therefore 
rarely to be found persons could successfully conduct a 
kindergarten. / These arguments would have acquired 
immeasurable force when confirmed by an abortive ex- 
periment. Dr. Harris steered the kindergarten course 
through stormy waters to a safe harbor.” With the 
public kindergarten a success in St. Louis, other cities 
were not slow to take it up, though in most places it 
passed through a period of private support before being 
made a part of the public school system. 
In Boston, from 1878 till 1889, Mrs. Quincy A. Shaw 
supported the entire free kindergarten movement of the 
city, maintaining as many as 30 at one time. When the 
city adopted them in 1889, there were 36 teachers and 
1074 pupils. Now (1903) the numbers are 167, and 4862.

  168 The Growth of the People's Schools 
In 1873 there were in the country 42 kindergartens 
with 73 teachers and 1252 pupils. The numbers at 
intervals since are as follows : —

Of the private kindergartens (which may be seen from 
the table to nearly equal the public ones in number, 
though they have but about one-third the total number 
of pupils) many are maintained as charitable institutions 
by the various kindergarten associations of the country, 
of which there are more than four hundred; many by 
other benevolent institutions; while by far the greater 
number are private enterprises conducted for gain. They 
vary in every particular, but are generally efficient, and 
are doing a most valuable work. 
From the beginning, it has been recognized that the 
kindergarten teacher needed special preparation of a 
character quite different from that of the teacher in the 
grades, and special training schools were early estab- 
lished. The first was a private institution started in 
Boston in 1869 under the direction of Miss King. In 
1872 Mrs. Kraus-Boelte set up one of a similar nature 
in New York City, which has ever since been one of the 
leading training schools for kindergartens. From that 
time on, their increase has been comparatively rapid, no 
large city being without one or more. Both the pub- 
lic and the private normal schools, too, have added kin-

dergarten departments in many instances, though the 
custom has not been by any means universal. At pres- 
ent forty-two of the public normal schools as well as all 
the institutions classed as teachers’ colleges are conduct- 
ing such departments. In the early days the course was 
of but a single year. {But thoroughly to master the 
Froebelian philosophy, as well as the technique of kin- 
dergarten practice, was found to demand a longer period 
of study; and now, in all the better institutions, at least 
two years are devoted to the special kindergarten train- 
ing course.

DEVELOPMENT IN PUBLIC SECONDARY EDUCATION 
By the middle of the nineteenth century, | public ele- 
mentary €ducation, supportéd by taxation, had been 
established in all-parts of the country. “There were per- 
haps restricted localities for which this was not true, but 
public feeling had been fully aroused to the belief that 
the hope of the republic rested upon the common school 
education of all the people. Beyond this point there 
was the greatest differéncé of opinion. Only the lead- 
ers of thought dared assert that the state should go far- 
ther, the great mass of the people believing that beyond 
this stage, all education should be by private enterprise. 
Many argued*that*the common school funds could not 
be applied legally to the support of higher education. 
In some states the controversy was spirited. But social 
and economic conditions _were Tapidly changing. The 
head of the family was receiving higher wages; and 
as a Consequence, at boys and girls were not forced into 
the ranks of producers at so early an age as formerly. 
  _This meant a longer school period, and the educational 
~ machinery was quick to adapt itself to the new condi- 
poe The result was the public high school,Public 
mar schools had been established in the New Eng- 
fame colonies as a as 1635, and in 1630 the school

inhabitants, the irst to establish a public high school with 
a two to four years~course-of study Was Boston, Massa- 
chiiSétts, in 1821. There had been, of course, the colo- 
nialgrammar schools in considerable numbers, as well as 
the private academies; but this is the first instance of 
the class of schools which we now know as the public 
high school with a fairly well organized course, of a defi- 
nite length. Previous to 1840 six other cities, all but 
one in New England, had established similar schools: 
Portland, Maine, in 1821; Worcester, Massachusetts, in 
1824; New Bedford, Massachusetts, in 1827; Cambridge 
and Taunton in the same state in 1838; and Philadel- 
phia, in 1839. Within the next decade seven more high 
schools had been added to the list in the North Atlantic 
states, one (New Orleans, 1843) in the South, and three 
(Cleveland, 1846, Cincinnati, 1847, and Toledo, 1849) 
in the North Central. The following table shows the 
decade of establishment of public high schools as already 
defined, with from two to four years’ courses in the 143 
largest cities. Many of these cities date the foundation 
of their high schools from some earlier period; but the 
years used in the preparation of the table are those upon 
which the courses of study were made, at least sufficiently 
near the grade of those in the public high schools of 
to-day as to warrant the use of the term.

  In studying this table, it must be borne in mind that 
it covers only the large cities of the country, yet they 
were, with few exceptions, the first to establish public 
high schools; and, except for the last three decades, the 
table covers nearly all instances, and is approximately 
valid for the beginnings of public secondary education 
in all parts of the country. 
Still another table, compiled from tables in the com- 
missioner’s report for 1902, shows some interesting facts, 
since it includes a much larger number of schools. It 
covers, as will be seen, 3179 in all; all, we may suppose, 
which could give dates of establishment, comprising 
roughly one-half those now in existence. A careful 
inspection, however, of the records upon which the table 
is based, leads me to believe that in some instances the 
date given is that of the beginning of the school from 
which the high school developed, rather than of the 
public high school itself. . Yet this seemed true in but 
few cases, probably not enough to invalidate the table. 
It is certain, however, that the earlier schools put down

for the Southern and Western states were, at the time 
indicated, private academies.

Exact conclusions drawn from this table would be use- 
less, since, as has been said, it covers but one-half the 
existing schools. Even then the numbers exceed those 
given elsewhere by the commissioner, which are that 
there were in the United States in 1870 about 160 pub- 
lic high schools and in 1880 nearly 800. At the end of 
each decade since, the numbers for the divisions of the 
country were as follows :—

In 1902 the total number of schools in all these divi-

485,422 of whom were males and 317,146 females, under 
a teaching force of 21,778. Harris,

    174 The Growth of the People's Schools 
The Course of Study 
Our _first.secondary.schools.were established solely for 
the. preparation.of-boys.for.college, and in its inception, 
at least in the East, the high school was little more than 
a publicly supported Latin school of the old colonial 
type. The aim was largely the same, and the course 
of study differed but little. The latter was rigidly pre- 
scribed, and consisted of those subjects which were 
demanded by the college entrance examinations. Of 
the Boston Latin School, the classical high school of 
the city, Superintendent Seaver says in his last report 
(1903) :— “As in the beginning, so ever since down to the present time, 
this school has aimed to give the boys of Boston who wished to 
take it, the best possible preparation for the university. Of course the 
‘University at Cambridge’ was the only one thought of in the earlier 
years ; but, as other universities and colleges have arisen, this school 
has opened the way to them all. It has always been a classical 
school.” 
But in this respect it differs from the vast majority of 
high schools of the country. The 1e great wave of public 
es school development kept. pace. with the feel- 
  school should be what it has. often. been called, the “peo- 
le’s college.” This being the case, new questions re- 
garding the coursé“of -study-arosé. The demands of the 
college entrance board and those of life were soon seen 
to differ materially. A prescribed classical course which 
had answered all purposes when supplemented by the 
broader and more extended study of the four years at 
college, was found to fit the student but poorly for the 
active duties of life when not so supplemented, and the
-P-A-G-E-191
  Developments in Secondary Education 175 
schools began trying experiments with the course of 
study, to see what came the nearest to remedying the 
defects. This process of experimentation has been go- 
ing on for many years now, and has even yet not ceased ; 
nor will it, in all probability, until we can have much 
fuller assurance than we have to-day, that a solution has 
been reached. The first move in the direction of making 
the high school more nearly meet the demands of every- 
day life was through the addition to the still prescribed 
course, of a number of subjects—each to be taken for 
a brief period — which, it was thought, would be useful 
to the student who was not to take the college step. In 
the decade from 1850 to 1860, when this plan was being 
exploited, it was not unusual for high schools to require, 
more than twenty separate subjects of all students, and \ 
in one instance the number was twenty-nine, and this in 
a three years’ course. he programme of the Boston 
English High School, with a three years’ course, con- 
tained, previous to 1860, the following studies: arith- 
metic, algebra, geometry, geography, general history, 
history of the United States, reading, grammar, decla- 
mation, rhetoric, composition, bookkeeping, natural phi- © 
losophy, moral philosophy, natural theology, evidences 
of Christianity, navigation, surveying, mensuration, astro- 
nomical calculations, Constitution of the United States, 
drawing, logic, and French. As might well be supposed, 
this structure of almost unlimited additions of prescribed 
subjects soon broke down of its own weight, and the ne: 
plan undertaken was that of a subdivision of these he 
jects into separate courses, each in itself rigidly pre- 
scribed, but with election of course, possible td the 
student. These courses were usually designatéd by 
names indicating in a general way the character of the 
subjects included, such as “ classical,” “ Latin scientific,” 
“modern language,” etc. This plan had many good 
features, and is followed in large numbers of schools to 
the present day. In fact, in a study of the courses of  
-P-A-G-E-192
  Phillips, 
Ped. Sem. VII. 
Thomson, + 176 The Growth of the Peoples Schools 
study of 176 high schools made by Professor Phillips, 
86 were found to be conducted upon this general plan. 
Among them are the high schools of St. Louis with 9 
such separate courses; Cleveland with 6; Salt Lake 
City, Milwaukee, and Seattle with 5 each, and Kansas 
City with 4. The average number of courses for the 
86 was 4.5. The fact that the course to be pursued 
must, in most instances, be selected at the beginning of 
the first year, when the student can neither be supposed 
to know his own permanent interests, nor can have 
advice of much value from the principal, has given rise 
to the plan of making it possible for the student to take 
a limited number of electives from subjects not included 
within the course. In many schools such a plan is in 
practice, eliminating largely the pedagogical shortcom- 
ings of the course system. 
The scheme, under which a large number of our best 
high schools are now being conducted, is not that of 
separate courses, but one based upon a “core” of sub- 
jects prescribed for all, in addition to which a large 
number of free electives are offered, from which the 
required number of subjects may be selected, without 
prescription. 
English, three or four years, and mathematics, usually 
two years, are the most frequent prescriptions under 
this plan, though history, science, and modern languages 
are sometimes included. Of 110 schools studied, -Pro- 
fessor Phillips found that 17 had 70 per cent or more of 
the students’ time devoted to the free electives; 24 be- 
tween 50 and 70 per cent; 45 between 40 and 50 per 
cent, while the remainder had less than 40 per cent. 
One school at least, that at Galesburg, Illinois, makes 
no prescription whatever, any subject being taken or 
rejected at the will of the student. The plan has been 
in operation there seemingly with good results. Of the 
class of 1900, consisting of 32 boys and 62 girls, English 
was taken by all, general history by 97 per cent, botany

by 88 per cent, civil government by 89 per cent, alge- 
bra by 75 per cent, physics by 66 per cent, Latin by 
56 per cent, and geometry by 46 per cent. 
Where sufficient influence, either on the part of the 
principal or the parents, can be brought to bear upon 
the pupil to lead him to choose of his own accord a 
course with no dangerously weak spots, this plan has 
many strong points; but without the certainty of such, 
it seems almost anarchistic. 
The percentages of the total number of students 
enrolled, who were taking certain studies in the high 
schools of the country for the years 1890-1901 inclusive, 
together with certain other facts having to do with the 
high school enrolment, is shown in the table on the 
following page. 
Some rather striking facts regarding the course of 
study are shown by this table: First, that the percent- 
age of students who are taking Latin seems to be 
rapidly increasing, having grown nearly one-fourth in 
the eleven years covered by the table. In the light of 
modern educational development it is not easy to account 
for this. In the higher institutions of learning, the 
‘tendency has been in the other direction; but 33 per 
cent of the students in colleges for men and for both 
sexes taking the subject in 1901, and when less than 12 
pér cent of the high school students are preparing for 
college, it is difficult to see what has given the subject 
its: value in the secondary school. Another, perhaps 
unexpected, showing is that for the sciences, every one 
of which, unless we include mathematics in the category, 
has seemingly decreased in popularity; physics having 
fallen from 24 per cent to a little more than 18 per cent, 
chemistry from 10.20 to 7.56 per cent, with most of 
the others in like proportion. The most plausible ex- 
planation of this, it seems to me, is in the more inten- 
sive way in which these subjects are studied. Formerly 
it was the custom for the students to take a little, per-

haps a term, of one science, and then to go on to another, 
thus figuring in the enrolment of a considerable number. 
Now a science, once taken, must in many cases be pur- 
sued for at least an entire year, thus reducing the num- 
ber taken, and consequently the total enrolment on the 
scientific side. We certainly are unwilling to believe 
that with all the increase in scientific equipment made 
by our high schools during the decade, that the depart- 
ments are being less fully utilized, and must conclude 
that the results may be expressed by the phrase, non 
multa, sed multum. 
In length, the high school course has become practi- 
cally fixed at four years. This following, as it does, the 
eight, or in some instances, nine years of work in the 
grades, meets the entrance requirements of any college, 
and is probably the academic equivalent of at least two 
years’ work in those institutions a half-century ago. 
Only in the smaller towns, where the common school 
preparation is deficient, or where a full four years’ high 
school course has not yet been established, would this 
not be the case. Under the conditions usually existing, 
the pupils reach the high school at about the age of 
fourteen years, completing it at eighteen.

high schools of Boston for the years 1902-1903 : —

At present there is agitation in educational circles in the 
direction of adding one or even two years to the course, 
making it possible for the student to gain that much 
advanced college standing; but as yet no schools are 
offering a definitely stated course of that length, leading 
up to graduation. In a few instances, as at Joliet, Illi- 
nois, advanced courses are offered, which may profit- 
ably be taken as graduate work; but beyond this the 
high schools have not yet gone. In breadth the cur- 
sriculum is rapidly widening, through the introduction of 
drawing and the fine arts, as well as manual training and 
the commercial subjects.

CHAPTER XIII 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCHOOL ORGANIZATION AND 
ADMINISTRATION 
  TuE_history of American school administration is a 
story of unifaction and standardization : of progress from 
the chaotic conditions under which each little hamlet 
was doing about what it pleased with its schools, in any 
way it pleased, without let or hindrance from any out- 
side the community, or adequate supervision by any 
within it, to those under which it is fully recognized that 
if the people as a whole are to be educated, definite 
standards of excellence must be demanded of all schools, 
and that such can only be maintained through the ap- 
pointment of responsible officials vested with authority 
to make demands, and competent to direct the schools 
in the process of meeting them. The evolution has 
been from a state of decentralization bordering on 
anarchy, to one in which there is at least a sufficient 
degree of centralized power in constituted school author- 
ity to make it certain that there can be no absolute 
school vacua in any part of the land. The whole move 
has been one of experiment: of feeling about for the 
of organization under which the most perfect 
0018 could be provided for all the people. Some 
backwardsteps have been taken, but they have, in 
every case, been due to mistakes in judgment rather 
than in purpose; and although the process is not by any 
means completed, we have every right to be proud of 
its results. The various units of organization, and 
therefore of supervision, which have been set up in this 
      
., Movement toward uniformity are as follows : —

a. The district. 
b. The city or town. 
c. The county. 
d. The state. 
Beyond this we have not gone, and perhaps never 
shall go. There is not with us a federal system of 
education, as there is in the European countries, our P. aoa. 
National Bureau of Education having no administrative 
or executive powers. Not all the units of administra- 
tion mentioned above are to be found in all the states, 
some having created their school systems without taking 
each of the successive steps. The state is, however, in 
every instance, the supreme power, doing what it pleases 
through legislation with the schools within its jurisdiction.

which the district was situated usually selected the teacher, 
and performed other necessary duties in-connection with 
the maintenance of the schools; but in an age when 
quantity of work done by the teacher rathé than quality 
the important desideratum, supervision, in the modern 
sense of the word, was entirely lacking, The religious 
phases of the-work..were..carefully guarded, _since the 
clergymen formed such an important part of the com- 
mittee ; but aside from the regular catechism ; and an oc- 
casional examination upon the sermon of the preceding 
Sunday, no intellectual tests were made use of. Until 
the act of 1789, the district, although performing an 
important function in school matters, was without legal 
rights. That act, however, gave it privileges which were 
dangerously extensive, and was declared by Horace Mann 
in his tenth annual report to be “the most unfortunate 
law on the subject of common schools ever enacted in 
the state.” Besides the authorization of the school dis- 
trict, it sanctioned the appointment of special committees 
to look after the schools, the first recognition of any func- 
tion on the part of a school officer beyond that of the 
employment and examination of teachers. The really 
disastrous legislation came, however, in 1801, grantingV 
the district the power to raise moneys by taxation, a 
right which had heretofore been vested in the larger 
social unit, the town. In actual practice, the district 
proved too small to be intrusted with final legislation in 
money matters, in many cases the sentiment among the 
limited number of voters within a single district being 
the opposite of generous toward the schools or the dis- 
trict too poor to do much; and although the acts of 1789 
and 1801, and similar laws passed in the neighboring 
states a little later, gave to New England the “little red 
schoolhouse” in great numbers, they were frequently 
not very red for want of paint, nor was the teaching 
within their walls of a very high order. Yet it cannot 
be denied that much good came from them,

  Organization and Administration 185 
The early district had no such thing within it as school 
supervision of a pedagogical nature. The school com- 
mittee was still supreme in matters of general direction, 
and its activities were little more than clerical. But 
soon after the passage of the law of 1827, Horace 
Mann began his campaign for better schools, and 
with the awakening which came with his secretary- 
ship of the Massachusetts board of education—prac- 
tically his state superintendency of schools —conditions 
began to change for the better. School committees in 
many towns, recognizing that one man could accomplish 
more by giving his whole time to the work than could 
several whose interests and time were divided, delegated 
to a single member, supervisory duties, and had him des- 
ignated as superintendent of schools. A little later men 
from without the board, who were skilled in school mat- 
ters, were selected for these positions, and we have the 
origin of the modern city superintendent. — 
In Connecticut the early history of school adminis- 
tration ran parallel to that of Massachusetts, except that 
there the school district took on an ecclesiastical color- 
ing. The church parish became the school district. 
When a town had but one parish, the selectmen were in 
full charge of the school; when it contained more than 
) one, a committee from each was given that authority. 
This move of giving religious organizations power over 
the schools was contrary to the general sentiment of 
religious freedom which pervaded American institutions ; 
and as soon as the intensely religious period of colonial 
days was passed, the plan was given up, though not 
without having been taken as a warning in the newer 
states, many of which have provided by constitution 
that no religious sect or body shall in any way control 
the school fund or any part of it. The district school 
system of New England was copied by nearly all the 
states in the West, as the population moved in that direc- 
tion: or it may be that similar conditions gave rise to Chapter VII.

  186 Zhe Growth of the People's Schools 
the same results in school organization without any pro- 
cess of imitation. In any event, except in the South, it 
was and is the common unit of school organization in 
the rural districts. In the Southern portions of our 
country it is prevalent to some extent; but the county 
there is more generally the unit of civil government, 
and consequently of school administration. In area and 
extent the school district is fixed at the convenience of 
the voters and may, in some instances, be coterminous 
with the township. When this is so fixed by state leg- 
islation, as is the case in Alabama, Indiana, and New 
Hampshire, the system is, properly speaking, one of 
township control rather than of district. On the other 
hand, the district may be extremely limited in area, as is 
shown by the fact that a number of states have upwards 
of twelve thousand each. The business of the school 
district is transacted at the annual school meeting, 
usually held in the spring, and is practically absolute in 
its legislative power. In general the,duties of the meet-_ 
ing are to elect officers, pass upon financial questions, 
fix the sites of schoolhouses, and vote upon questions of 
boundaries. In some instances minor questions of school 
administration are brought before the school meeting. 
The number and the character of the officers are usually 
determined by state law, and vary with different states. 
Each board of local officers has; however, at least four 
duties to perform: (1) the reception of moneys from the 
county or state, or both, (2) its disbursement, (3) the 
levying, and (4) disbursement of local taxes. 
In some form or other, the district school system exists 
to-day in a great majority of the states. In Maine, New 
Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and 
Indiana, it has been entirely superseded by the township 
system, though formerly in vogue. In many others, as, 
for instance, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Wisconsin, 
Minnesota, Illinois, the Dakotas, and the upper penin- 
sula of Michigan, it is permissive; and exists alongside 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  Organization and Administration 187 
of the township system. In some states the district is 
primarily a subdivision of the town or township; in 
others, of the county. In nearly all, the voters within 
the district elect the school officers and levy taxes, 
though in some those functions are performed by the 
county. City school systems are usually districts which 
have obtained, through legislative enactment, special 
privileges. 
No one can deny that the district system has been a 
necessary step in the evolution of school organization. 
It was the only available means of bringing the school 
within the reach of all, and when the population of the 
country was largely rural, it worked comparatively well. 
“Certainly,” says President Draper, “the American District 
School System is to be spoken of with respect, for it has exerted a 
marked influence upon our citizenship, and has given strong and 
wholesome impulses to the affairs of the nation.” 
Yet with all its imperfections at its best, conditions 
have so changed as to limit its usefulness, and even 
in many parts of our country to make it a menace to 
‘educational progress. With the drift of population 
toward the urban centres, many districts have become 
so impoverished as to leave but scanty and insufficient 
revenue for school purposes, and at the same time so 
depopulated as to leave most of the desks vacant. Since 
a certain amount of money is necessary to the support 
of a teacher, no matter how few the pupils, in many 
cases the cost of education per pupil has become ex- 
cessively high, while in others this has been guarded 
against by the employment of the cheapest and most 
incompetent teachers, to the detriment of the schools. 
Many schools have been kept in operation with only 
two or three pupils registered, and in some entire states 
a considerable proportion have less than five. Gerry- 
manderings, too, have not infrequently taken place 
within townships, in such a way as to bring the wealthy Butler Ed, in 
U.S. Vol. Ip.
-P-A-G-E-204
  188 The Growth of the People’s Schools 
portions within a single district, leaving the poorer ones 
to struggle for the maintenance of an impoverished 
school. Many other difficulties have arisen; and although 
the plan had its advantages in the early period of the 
public school effort, especially while public funds were 
largely supplemented by tuition fees, it has no advan- 
tages to offset its evils, and the future will see it replaced 
by some system based upon a larger unit of organization, 
under which the schools may be better supported through 
a more equable distribution of wealth. 
6. TownsuHip AND CiTy ORGANIZATION 
The township and the incorporated city are the units 
in school organization which are fast superseding the 
district. Consolidation in school matters is as crying a 
question as it is in manufacture and finance, and will, 
perhaps, prove a greater blessing. The township organ- 
ization is but a merger of districts with practically the 
same rights and privileges as were invested in each of 
the original districts. “The officers are chosen at the 
annual town-meetings by all the electors, or, as is some- 
times the case, the township is the unit of school gov- 
ernment, and the schools are made uniform throughout 
its extent. It is a less formally democratic and more 
fully centralized system than the one which it is super- 
seding, and has the advantage of forcing the wealthier 
portions of the township to contribute to the support of 
the schools in the poorer communities, thus bringing 
about a more uniform standard of excellence. 
But a comparatively few states, and those for the 
most part among the older ones, — Maine, New Hamp- 
shire, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Indiana, 
—have a compulsory township organization by legisla- 
tive enactment. Of these, Massachusetts was the first 
to abolish the district system, which it did in 1882;
-P-A-G-E-205
  Organization and Administration 189 
New Hampshire followed in 1886, Vermont in 1892, and 
Maine in 1893. 
‘In at least twenty-one other states — Connecticut, 
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, lowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Mich- 
igan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, New York, 
North Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, 
Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Wiscon- 
sin —there is permissive legislation looking toward some 
form of school centralization) though in most of them it 
is as yet being slightly carried out. Where the town- 
ship system is being introduced, it has tended to give 
rise to two distinct classes of schools: first, centralized 
rural schools in convenient locations throughout the 
township, usually graded, and with two or more teach- 
ers; second, township high schools. In some instances 
schools of both these classes exist within the same town- 
ship, and even in connection with isolated or unattached 
districts. “Such a centralization of schools has given 
rise to the problem of free transportation of pupils. 
With many district schools within the township area, no 
home could be very far from school privileges of some 
sort; with three or four schools within the same area, 
considerable distances must of necessity be travelled by 
some of the pupils, and some legal provision be made for 
transportation, if the plan is to be a success. NMassa- 
chusetts, in 1869, was the first state to expend public 
funds for the transportation of pupils from the rural 
district to the town schools, and in 1901 was expending 
$151,773, or 1.07 per cent of the total school fund, for 
this purpose. Vermont instituted the plan in 1894, and 
its expenditure in 1900 was $26,492, or 2.47 per cent 
of the school fund. Maine began it one year later, and 
in 1901 devoted 3.13 per cent of the fund to the trans- 
portation of pupils. VThe average cost per pupil for 
transportation within these states is about 8 cents a 
day, and it has been almost uniformly proven that the 
plan is a saving in expense, over that of maintaining the
-P-A-G-E-206
  190 The Growth of the People's Schools 
larger number of rural schools, as well as one insuring 
better teachers and equipment, better supervision, greater 
regularity of pupils’ attendance, and a better school 
spirit. 
In a considerable number of the Western ‘states, 
notably Ohio, which first passed a special law in 1894 
authorizing the transportation of pupils in Kingsville 
and Ashtabula counties, and then made it general in 
1898, the plan is in practice. 
The township high school, mentioned as another im- 
portant result of township organization, is being estab- 
lished in those states where the township unit of school 
organization is permissible, in townships which do not 
contain an incorporated city or village. In some in- 
stances, too, even where such incorporation does exist, 
the township is made the unit of organization for the 
high school, in order, both to extend its benefits to all 
within the township limits, and also to make the basis of 
taxation larger. Indiana, in which the township unit of 
school organization is compulsory by law, had, in 1902, 
502 such schools, with 10,253 pupils. Illinois has 27 
township high schools, the first established at Princeton, 
in 1867. 
On the whole, the move in the direction of the town- 
ship high school is a very encouraging one. It is the 
only plan by which we can hope to bring the privileges 
of a secondary school education within the reach of all, 
and any legislation leading in its direction should be 
encouraged. 
The city unit in school organization is but a district, 
or collection of districts, or a township in which the 
schools are usually administered under some law relat- 
ing to centres of population above a stated minimum, or 
between definite limits. Such laws exist in every state, 
and have to do with such matters as those of local taxa- 
tion and the size of school board. The vast majority of 
the cities in our country are established under such laws,
-P-A-G-E-207
Organization and Administration 191 
  though a considerable number of the largest ones have 
appealed to the state legislature for special privileges 
better adapted to meet local conditions, and have school 
systems based upon their special charters. Because of; 
this fact, there is no semblance of uniformity in school 
organization in our largest cities. 
Nearly all, however, meet upon the common ground 
of the school board, and the superintendent of schools. 
The former is but the cosmopolitan representative of 
the old school committee of the towns, with its func- 
tions modified and enlarged, and its composition much 
varied. As to size of school boards, we find variations 
among the fifty largest cities in the country from 84 to 
3 in number of members, with an average membership 
of 12, Throughout the West the numbers run consid- | 
erably smaller than in the East; the average for the 
former region being but 102 to 24 for the latter, with a 
general tendency in all parts, toward a reduction in 
size. It seems probable that when the stages of experi- 
mentation are over, 9 will be the common number. _~ 
In length of term, also, there is great variation among 
the boards of education in the fifty largest cities. 
Among them: — 
15 cities select members for a term of 2 years 
22 cities select members for a term of 3 years 
7 cities select members for a term of 4 years 
5 cities select members for a term of 6 years 
1 city selects members for a term of 7 years. 
The method of selection of these officials is either 
through election by the people, or by appointment. 
The former method is practised in 32 of the larger 
cities, appointment in 17, and a combination of the two 
plans in 2. Of those that elect, 18 do so by wards, 
and 12 at large. Where the latter method of appoint- 
ment is in vogue, it is made in two cities on the ward 
basis, and in 12, at large.
-P-A-G-E-208
P. 185. 192 The Growth of the People’s Schools 
  The growing tendency is, however, in the direction 
of selection at large, rather than as representative of 
any particular ward or precinct of the city. In those 
cities where the method of appointment is in vogue, the 
power is vested in various persons or boards, usually the 
mayor, who is given the requisite authority, either with, 
or without the approval of the city council. The table 
on pages 194 and 195 gives a summary of conditions 
in several of our great centres of population. 
Of our larger cities, Cleveland, Ohio, is the only 
one which departs in any important way from the 
general type of school organization. There the school 
council of seven members is elected at large by the city, 
each member receiving a salary of $260 per annum. 
A so-called school director is also elected in the same 
manner, with a salary of $5000. In business matters 
his power is practically supreme, even to the extent of 
vetoing the action of the city council in matters having 
to do with the schools. He also has the power of 
appointing the superintendent of schools for an indefi- 
nite term, with an annual salary equal to his own. 
The latter is solely responsible for the educational work 
of the schools, having full power to appoint, promote, 
and dismiss all teachers. No other such centralized 
form of school administration exists anywhere in the 
country; but the plan has worked well for ten years, 
and is well worth the careful study of any student of 
educational organization. 
Buffalo might be said to have a plan all of its own, 
since it is without a school board of any sort, intrusting 
the management of all school matters to the city coun- 
cil. This would be a dangerous plan to follow, but it 
has, nevertheless, worked well in that city. 
The establishment of the office of superintendent of 
schools was an early move in city school organization. 
Its growth was a natural one, and has already been 
touched upon, Starting almost simultaneously in cities 
 
-P-A-G-E-209
  Organization and Administration 193 
and towns in various parts of the country, it has become 
the almost universal custom, nearly ten thousand such 
officers being now in service. The dates of establish- 
ment of the office in some of the principal cities are as 
follows :— 
Buffalo, N.Y. . . . « 1837  Newark,N.Y. . . . . 1853 
Louisville, Ky. . . . . 1837 Cleveland, Ohio . . . 1853

Jersey, Gity’. 2... %. 1853 Philadelphia, Pa, 2)... “1883 
Brooklyn, N.Y... . . 1853 
As shown by the table, the cities of Louisville, Ken- 
tucky, and Buffalo, New York, may lay claim to having 
the first city superintendents of schools, priority depend- 
ing upon the exact day of appointment. This I have 
not been able to determine, though the appointment at 
Louisville was previous to September 16 of that year. 
His title at first was agent of the board of school visi- 
tors, but his duties were in every respect those of the 
later city superintendents. The last of the great cities 
to create the office was Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, fol- 
lowing the lead, not only of those in the list, but of sev- 
eral hundred others of smaller size. 
The city superintendents of schools are almost uni- 
versally elected by the board of education, too fre- 
quently for a term of but one year. Their duties and 
powers are extremely varied, but suggested by the table Rep. Com. Ed. 
on page 196, which covers the conditions in 233 cities 79° 1: 553- 
and towns in Massachusetts.

Not all the officers covered by the table are, strictly   speaking, city superintendents, — since in Massachusetts 
the plan was inaugurated in 1888 by permissive legisla- 
tion, of consolidating several towns into a single district 
for purposes of superintendency, one officer being given 
the direction of all the schools within the district. By 
an amendment, made in 1891, the minimum salary of 
such an official was fixed at $1500, enough to insure 
good service, of which the state pays one-half. Later 
legislation made it obligatory upon every town to have 
its schools under the direction of such a superintendent 
after July 1, 1902, so every school in Massachusetts to- 
day is under the direction of competent pedagogical 
experts, and thus is accomplished a move for ees 
Horace Mann practically gave his life.

  Organization and Administration 197 
c. THE County 
Throughout the South, the county has been the gen- 
eral unit in all forms of government, and consequently 
the basis of school administration. As a result, those 
functions which were in the earlier times in New Eng- 
land performed by the district school board, such as 
the examination and appointment of teachers, providing 
school buildings and raising school funds, etc., are the 
duties of the county officials. The different states, 
however, have different methods for the administra- 
tion of this county school business. In Georgia and 
Maryland there are no subdivisions of the county for 
rural school purposes, and it is in all essentials a single 
district. In several others, the county authorities sub- 
divide the territory, appointing district officials, practi- 
cally as their agents. This is the case in Alabama, 
where the congressional township is used for adminis- 
trative convenience. Florida provides for the forma- 
tion of districts with limited power within the county ; 
Louisiana recognizes the congressional township much 
as is the case in Alabama. Mississippi, North Carolina, 
Tennessee, and Utah make provisions for subdivision, 
but in each instance subject to county authority. 
In all these states where the county is the unit of 
school organization, as well as in practically all the 
others, save those in New England, county superin- 
tendents of schools are maintained, whose duty it is to 
have general supervision of the rural schools. Those 
states, too, at one time or another have had such offices, 
but have abolished them. New York was the first state 
to appoint county superintendents of schools (1841), 
though the office has not been continuous in the state 
since that time. Previous to 1851 four other states had 
followed the plan, while all the newer ones have had the 
office since the beginning of their school legislation. 
Its function is in most states to examine and certificate P. 78.
-P-A-G-E-214
198 The Growth of the People’s Schools 
    teachers, to keep general records of the school and give 
them to the state superintendent, and to make one or 
more visits annually to each school within the county 
for purposes of general supervision. In some states 
there is an educational prerequisite to eligibility to the 
office, though this is by no means the rule, and too fre- 
quently the office is made political spoil, and turned 
over to persons wholly unfitted for the position. 
In by far the greater number of the states the office 
is elective, but in some, variations from the plan exist. 
In Indiana it is filled by appointment of the township 
trustees ; in Pennsylvania by the school directors within 
the county; in New Jersey, Mississippi, and Virginia by 
the state board of education; in Alabama by the state 
superintendent of public instruction; in Delaware and 
Florida by the governor; while in North Carolina the 
appointive power is in the hands of the county board 
of education, the clerk of the supreme court, and the 
registrar of deeds. The common term of office is two 
years, though in Pennsylvania, New York, and New 
Jersey it is three, and in Illinois, Oregon, and Wisconsin 
it is four. 
Since pedagogical prerequisites to the office of county 
superintendent of schools are entirely wanting in some 
states, and only of the meagrest sort in any, variations 
in efficiency have been more marked within it than any 
other supervisory school office. In many instances, 
perhaps it would be safe to say in most, careful and 
conscientious work is being done; but it is nevertheless 
true that the political affiliations of the office are such as 
to introduce more frequent exceptions to this rule than 
is the case with city superintendents, much to the cost 
of rural schools in some parts of the country. It must 
be recognized, however, that the county is too large a 
unit to make efficient pedagogical supervision of all the 
schools possible for a single officer, and we cannot doubt 
that the tendency will be in the direction of its sub-

   division, either as it has been done in Massachusetts, P. x02, 
or through a deputation of the duties of the county 
superintendent to a number of subordinate officials. 
@. THE STATE SySTEM 
   The state is the unit for general school legislation, and 
in this it is supreme. Beyond this point it hardly goes, 
though where a state board of education, or its equiv- 
alent, under any title is maintained, some administrative 
powers are given it. In no sense, however, does the 
state exercise supervisory powers over the actual work 
of instruction, since in many states it would be mani- 
festly impossible for the state superintendent of instruc- 
tion even to visit, for the briefest possible time, all the 
schools within his jurisdiction in the course of his term 
of office, and such visitation does not come within the 
function of the state board. 
The state board of education does not exist in all Appendix G. 
states, and in those in which it does, its functions vary 
materially. The first state to establish such a general 
board was New York, through the appointment of its so- P. 78. 
called board of regents in 1784. This was originally 
little more than an advisory board for Columbia College 
at the time of its reorganization at the close of the 
Revolution; but its powers were gradually increased, 
until it has the general supervision of all matters having 
to do with private educational institutions in the state, 
public schools being under the control of the state 
superintendent of public instruction. The regents are 
nineteen in number, and constitute the University of the 
State of New York. 
North Carolina was the next state to establish a state 
educational board, which it did in 1825, under the title 
“President and Directors of the Literary Fund.” This 
consisted of the chief justice of the supreme court, the 
speakers of both houses of the legislature, and the state

treasurer. The name state board of education was 
first used in Missouri in 1835 for a similar body. 
Massachusetts established its state board of education 
in 1837. It consists of eight members, one appointed 
annually by the governor for a term of eight years, 
together with the governor and lieutenant-governor, ex 
officio. The board is responsible for the management 
of the state normal schools, the holding of teachers’ 
institutes, the gathering and publishing of statistics, and 
for the examination and certification of teachers. It 
employs agents, who visit the teachers’ institutes, and in 
many ways come into direct contact with the school 
officers of the state. The state board in Connecticut 
(established 1838) is organized upon much the same 
plan. The other states present the greatest variation 
in duties and powers. 
In Illinois, where the board was established in 1857, 
the members are appointed by the governor for a term 
of six years, and the duties are solely in connection with 
the management of the State Normal University at 
Normal. 
In California the duties are almost entirely confined to 
the examination and certification of teachers. The same 
is true for Kansas, and a large number of other states. 
In those states where the members of the board are 
state officials it is little more than an organization for 
the transaction of school business and the collection of 
data. In those in which it is made up of educators 
chosen for their efficiency in school organization, its 
influence for good is very great, and it is encouraging to 
note that the tendency is in the direction of the latter 
form of organization. 
Each state in the Union has an officer, designated 
in twenty-nine of them as the state superintendent of 
public instruction, in three as secretary of the state 
board of education (Massachusetts, Connecticut, and 
Delaware), and in others superintendent “of common
-P-A-G-E-217
  Organization and Administration 201 
schools,” or ‘of public schools,” or ‘commissioner of 
public schools,’— who is at the head of the public 
school system of the state. 
The first to establish the office was New York, Gideon 
Hawley being appointed to the position in 1813. After 
eight years the office was abolished and its duties were 
turned over to the secretary of state, by whom they 
were usually perfunctorily performed until 1854, in 
which year the office was reéstablished, and has since 
been continued. In Maryland, which first had a state 
superintendent in 1825, and Vermont in 1827, the office 
has not been continuous, and it remained for Pennsyl- 
vania (1833) to set the first unbroken pace. Michigan 
followed in 1836, and Massachusetts in 1837 with 
Horace Mann, under the title of Secretary of the State 
Board of Education. Kentucky was next (also in 1837), 
and then Connecticut with Henry Barnard, under the 
same title as Mann’s in Massachusetts. His office was, 
however, abolished in 1842, though resumed by himself 
seven years later. 
Since that time, the general establishment of the 
office has been rapid, with the newer states dating from 
the beginning of state organization. 
The powers and duties of the superintendents vary 
greatly in the different states. In New York State he 
is given sufficient authority to make the office one of 
dignity and of influence, which are lamentably wanting in 
many others. There he is a final arbiter in all matters 
having to do with the schools, and his decisions cannot 
be reversed by the courts. He may overrule the action 
of any district or city school board, even closing a school 
arbitrarily if he deems it wise, or may remove any mem- 
ber of such board. No such power is vested in any 
other school officer in the country. 
In all states it is the duty of the superintendent to 
collect statistics, and at stated intervals to publish them. 
He also has control of the state school fund, making the P. 8.
-P-A-G-E-218
  202 The Growth of the People’s Schools 
proper apportionments. In many he directs the exami- 
nation of teachers for state certificates; in some he is 
at the head of the institute system. 
In the great majority of states he is elected by popu- 
lar vote, and this fact has in many instances given a 
political flavor to the office which has worked great 
harm. Coming at the end of the ticket, as it usually 
does in nominating conventions, it is not infrequently 
apportioned to some geographical locality which has not 
been represented near its head, irrespective of merit, and 
so it has sometimes happened that the best man has not 
been chosen. But on the whole our state superintend- 
ents of public instruction have been men of the highest 
character and efficiency, and have accomplished all that 
their legal powers would permit. 
e. THE NatTionaL BuREAU OF EDUCATION 
The federal government at Washington has never 
attempted any control over public instruction in the 
several states, and in this respect offers a marked con- 
trast to the continental countries of Europe. The need 
of some national agency which should act in an advisory 
relation to the schools of the country, collect statistics, 
and serve as an educational clearing house, was however 
early felt; and in 1867, upon motion by James A. Gar- 
field, who delivered at the time an address which was a 
masterly review of American education and its needs, 
Congress passed a bill establishing a department of 
education, placing Henry Barnard at its head as com- 
missioner. He was given a salary of $4000, and was 
allowed three assistants. Two years later the depart- 
ment was made a bureau of the interior department, 
which it still remains. In 1870 Dr. Barnard was suc- 
ceeded as commissioner by John Eaton, who served for 
sixteen years. Nathaniel H. R. Dawson followed with 
aterm of three years. In 1889 William T. Harris, the
-P-A-G-E-219
    
Organization and Administration 203 
present commissioner, was appointed, and has made the 
office an increasingly valuable one. Since the establish- 
ment of the bureau, annual reports have been issued of 
from eight hundred to more than twenty-five hundred 
pages, besides nearly three hundred separate volumes 
and pamphlets of the greatest value upon a great vari- 
ety of educational topics. The annual reports contain, 
besides detailed statistics covering all the educational 
institutions of the country, special chapters upon the 
history and philosophy of education in our own and 
foreign countries, and other subjects invaluable to the 
student of educational problems. It is safe to say 
that no other country makes such monumental con- 
tributions to the literature of education as we, through 
these reports. 
School Support 
In the early days the financial support of the schools 
was wholly local, either through fees, town taxes, or 
private bequest. In some instances, as in North Carolina 
with the excise fees, and in Boston and Burlington, New 
Jersey, where lands were set apart as a source of rev- 
enue, and in Plymouth, where fishing rights were dis- 
posed of for the same purpose, the school had some 
particular franchise to depend upon, but such cases are 
comparatively rare. Public lotteries were also some- 
times made use of as sources of school support, though 
usually for purposes of higher education. But it was 
the general rule for the parents of the pupils to pay for 
the schools outright. As time went on, the custom 
became general for states to set apart public lands for 
school purposes. As early as 1733 Connecticut set 
apart a considerable area to “the perpetual use of the 
schools.” In 1795 the same state turned over to the 
school fund $1,000,000, the proceeds of the sale of 
lands in the “Western Reserve.” In 1786 New York P. 68.

-P-A-G-E-220
    Boone, p. 86. 204 The Growth of the People’s Schools 
set apart two lots in each township of unoccupied lands 
for the uses of the schools, and in 1801 established a per- 
manent school fund by the sale of 500,000 acres of 
vacant land. Twenty years later Maine disposed of 
twenty townships for school purposes, while New 
Hampshire, at about the same time, instituted a tax upon 
all banks in the state to the same end. 
In most of the older states school funds were estab- 
lished from one source or another ; in Virginia — (1810), 
South Carolina (1811), and North Carolina (1825) by 
direct state appropriation; in Alabama, Florida, Ken- 
tucky, Louisiana, and Tennessee by apportionment of 
lands. By various acts of Congress, all states admitted 
to the Union previous to 1848 received the sixteenth 
section in each township for school purposes, and in 
those admitted subsequent to that time, the thirty-sixth 
as well (Utah receiving four sections), making in all 
67,893,919 acres, which, at the traditional price of $1.25 
per acre, makes a perpetual endowment of nearly 
$85,000,000. The states have all made material addi- 
tions to the fund, so that in the year 1901-1902 the total 
income from the general funds amounted to $10,522,343. 
In 1836 the twenty-seven states then organized re- 
ceived from Congress the sum of $42,000,000. Sixteen 
of them devoted their quotas, in part or in whole, to the 
public schools, eight turning over the whole sum (Ala- 
bama, Delaware, Kentucky, Missouri, New York, Ohio, 
Rhode Island, and Vermont). 
Apart from the national bequests, the entire support 
of the public schools has come from within the states, 
either from state taxes, local taxes, or tuition, etc. The 
exact sums coming from each of these sources for certain 
years are as follows: —

  CHAPTER XIV 
TEXT-BOOKS 
WueEn our forefathers crossed the Atlantic to make 
homes for themselves in America, they brought with 
them beside the tools for the tillage of the soil, other 
things they deemed essential to the new civilization 
which they were to establish. Among their other 
worldly goods they placed the Psalter, Testament, and 
Bible, and the little books of their_childhood, from 
which the they ha med their létters-and-their--prayers : 
the Horn Book, ABC. Leitner, BP Book...of. Civilitie,. and

years, since it was wholly engaged_in turning out con- 
   troversial pamphlets of a religic Tt*is~not__ 
strange, ‘therefore;-that the needs of the elementary 
schools were overlooked. 
This dearth of books of a secular nature, suitable for 
school use, had a very marked influence upon the kind 
of text-books in use in the colonies during the next two 
centuries. The colonists were a class of people who 
soon became used to meeting “problems with such re- 
sources as they had at their command. A scarcity “of 
such books as they” themselves “had studied was a sore 
distress, but not one that they could not..mitigate, at 
least temporarily. This they did by what was to them 
the most logical method. When_the colonists lacked 
Primer, Spelling Book, and A B Cas tools of instruction, 
they brought into use the Catechism,..Psalter, Testa- 
ment, and Bible. Being a.deyout people, every family 
was supplied with these; and they, added to the small 
stock of special books of instruction, in a way supplied 
the want. 
The religious nature of education in the seventeenth 
century, particularly in New England, was such as to 
make the use of church books for school books an easy 
step. It did not appear a radical departure for the 
American colonists to press Testament and Bible into 
the service of elementary education, when primers and 
other school books were wanting. Sg thoroughly es- 
tablished did such..books~become;-that.they gave their 
names to the various divisions of pupils, and we find in 
use such terms as “ psalter class,” “ testament class,” and 
“Bible class.” Whilé-it-was-the lack of school books 
that had brought the church books into use, the substitu- 
tion was a perfectly satisfactory one to the Puritan” “of 
New England:--If-the _Word-was~the means as well as

the end of education, so much the better; and this fact 
perhaps accounts for the long rule of the Testament 
and Psalter in public and private education in this 
country. 
While the primarily religious works were the most 
important books of instruction during the earlier dec- 
ades, it must not be supposed that other kinds of books 
went out of use entirely. Lheek Florn Book was cer- 
tainly widely Sa for teaching fh the ‘letters. and_other 
  ‘It. early. consisted of a. - of

     mo a 
parch ment, with the. 
instruction painted 
being fastened’ to a slab of wood, usually oak, and cov- 
ered with a thin piece of translucent.horn for. protection. 
The whole was made in a form convenient to be carried 
in the hand, usually of battledore shape. While the 
Horn Book, as above described, existed very early, it did 
not come into general use until about the beginning”of 
the seventeenth century, and continued to be used until 
about the end of the eighteenth, though during that 
périod i its..evolution-was»through™many~forms»-and 
      “At first the alphabet was all the reading matter it 
contained, but later we find other material of an elemen-

tury the Horn Book became so fully elaborated as to 
lose~all-régemblance to its former self. ~ The ‘various 
folding pastebo: rd books, and even thé samplers of the 
colonial maidens, were undo ibtedly its, scendants. 
Between the Hori Book and Catechism or Psalter, a 
heterogeneous mass of semi-religious school books of the 
primer type, imported or brought over by the colonists, 
afforded the means of progress from the alphabet to 
higher learning. Among these were the A BC and the 
primer of the old type, which were superseded by the

ee sacl A B C-Primer, or new primer, which in- 
led the contents of both. Practically all the books 
used for elementary education during ‘the first~¢ 
of colonialdife-were-réligious in their general nature, 
but they were religious in varying degree. The Cate- 
chism, ‘the Psalter, the Testament, and the Bible formed 
a class of purely theological books, while the Horn Book, 
the A BC, the Primer, and the Book of Manners formed 
another class, partly devotional and partly secular. 
These were, however, until well along in the seventeenth 
century, practically all importations, for the American 
printing press was slow in getting into active operation. 
The first book, or tract, printed in Boston was in 
1675; but this was not for use in the schools. Con- 
necticut Colony did not print its first book until about 
1710, while for Rhode Island the date was 1729. In 
1694 New York had printed its first book in the shop 
of William Bradford, and the first brought out in Phila- 
delphia seems to have been issued by Jansen, the suc- 
cessor of Bradford, some years later. 
In the importations from Europe during the seven- 
teenth century, we have the fullest evidence that 
foreign books were the main media of instruction. Be- 
tween 1650 and 1655 catechisms were especially printed 
in London for the Dorchester (Mass.) schools. In 
1661 the Dutch East India Company provided the 
public schoolmaster of New Amsterdam with an in- 
voice of books for the elementary school. In 1696 the 
King of Sweden sent four hundred primers and five 
hundred catechisms to the Swedes in Pennsylvania. Of 
the elementary books, excluding catechisms, published 
previously to 1700 and listed by Barnard, eighteen were 
published in England and only two in America. Of 
these latter the dates are 1685 and 1692. 
Throughout the seventeenth century, then, the colo- 
nies were dependent upon importation. from the mother 
  country for the supply of text-books. These were all”
-P-A-G-E-227
  Text-books 211 
more or less religious in their nature, with biblical texts 
most widely prevalent. They were, with few excep- 
tions, the work both of English compilers and printers. 
While this is true for the seventeenth century, the next 
was one of marked progress toward text-book independ- 
ence, and the American printer was the largest contribu- 
tor to the movement. It_is difficult to say just when

an elementary text destined to be one of the first and 
most-important of the long liné“of-American..clemen-

lished by Benjamin Harris at the London Coffee House, 
Boston, and was itself a reprint of the Protestant Tutor, 
published in London a short time previously by the same 
Benjamin Harris. This Primer seems to have won pop- 
ular favor at once, for a second edition was announced 
as early as 1691, and throughout the eighteenth century 
its success was most startling. Almost innumerable edi- 
tions were issued by various printers. That some of 
these were large is shown from the accounts of Benjamin 
Franklin and David Hall in Philadelphia, who, in the 
seventeen years between 1749 and 1766, sold 37,100 
copies. The Mew England..Primer..became.the..most

opening pages, upon which were a frontis- 
piece, Bible quotations, and. rhymes, appeared the alpha- 
bet in small, ‘capital, and italic letters, followed by.vov 
consonants, and double letters. Next.came the syllaba- 
rium, with its “easy syllables for.children,” and words 
from.one to six or more syllables. The Lord’s Prayer 
and Creed usually follow. Various alphabetical rhymes 
came next, including “An Alphabet of Lessons for 
Youth,” full of moral precepts and good advice. The 
famous poem of John Rogers’ Martyrdom filled the suc- 
ceeding pages, and a catechism, either that of the West- 
minster Assembly or John Cotton’s “ Spiritual Milk 
for American Babes” usually closed the little volume. 
In certain editions, however, “A Dialogue Between 
Christ, Youth, and The Devil” were the last words. 
The editions varied greatly, but the undoubted Puri- 
tanical nature of the book can readily be gathered from 
what has been indicated. The success of the Mew Eng- 
land Primer not only stimulated the printers and book- 
sellers to issue it in numerous editions, but also to 
import and print similar texts, in the hope of equal suc- 
cess. This latter tendency placed upon the market a 
number of other primers, no one of which ever approxi- 
mated the popularity of their prototype and model. Be- 
tween the years 1730 and 1770 we find advertised a 
considerable number of Church of England Primers, 
several Royal Primers, and quite a crop of elementary 
books, under such titles as “ Instructor,” “ Plaything,” 
“Token,” and “ Easy Guide.” Most of the latter con- 
tained more secular matter than the Mew England 
Primer. In fact, a growing tendency toward seculari- 
zation is apparent all through the later years of the 
century. The Mew England Primer itself very well 
shows this. At first it was full of religious elements of 
a distinctly Puritanical kind. Some changes began to

creep in, which indicated the presence of a movement 
toward making school books more useful and more in- 
teresting to children—an idea which would not have 
suggested itself to the old Puritans. With the coming of 
the great religious awakening in which Whitfield played 
so important a part, the Primer immediately reflected 
the sentiment of the time, and more religious matter 
was at once introduced, including, in an addition of 
1737, the familiar verses beginning, “ Though I am but 
a little one,” and “ Now I lay me down to sleep.” This 
period of the evangelization of the Primer came between 
the years 1740 and 1760. It was, however, closely fol- 
lowed by a reaction, which during the Revolutionary 
period was characterized by an intensely loyal spirit. 
This passed, attention was directed to devices for at- 
tracting and pleasing the children. What was, perhaps, 
the worst degradation of the Primer, in the eyes of the 
good old Puritans, came when a block of playing cards 
of the time was inserted as a representation of the 
Queen. Says Ford :— 
“This secularization was an attack by its friends from which the 
book never quite recovered, for the printers having once found how 
much more saleable such primers were, and parents having found 
out how much more readily their children learned, both united in 
encouraging more popular school books, and very quickly illustrated 
primers, which aimed to please rather than to torture, multiplied. 
While the primer was the most,.important book up to 
the time of the Revolutionary War, the popularity of 
another work, the spelling book, had, begun to grow long 
before that time. About the middle of the eighteenth cen- 
tury there was a gradual differentiation of spelling from 
reading, giving rise to the new book, which at first was 
little more than an expansion of the syllabarium of the 
primer. As was usually the case with new books in 
colonial times, those earliest used were importations 
from England. Indeed, there is no evidence that a 
single speller was published in- America during the first Ford, p. 5%.

structor: the Art of Spelling Improved, was printed in 
Boston, as the pioneer, followed by a number of others, 
the most successful of the earlier ones being Dillworth’s 
New Guide to the English Tongue, which achieved con- 
siderable popularity. This book had passed through 
twenty-six English editions; and, after its first Ameri- 
can reprint in Philadelphia, in 1757, is said to have run 
off ninety-eight editions previous to 1778. The book 
was more than a speller in the modern sense. Besides 
long lists of words, ranging from the simplest to those 
of six and seven syllables, it contained reading matter, 
similarly graded, and consisting of short sentences for 
beginners, and illustrated fables for the more advanced. 
While this speller was far less religious than the first Vew 
England Primer, its tone was still moral and religious. 
In fact, all the short sentences for beginners in reading 
were taken from the Psalter, and some of the editions 
contained the shorter Catechism, showing that the publish- 
ers were afraid that a speller alone might be considered 
too worldly a book. Yet, even with the Catechism, this 
speller indicates quite a lowering of religious standards. 
The Revolution limited the home and foreign supply 
of text-books; but this was only a pause before an ad- 
vance. ‘“Scarcely had the war closed when text-books 
were published in such numbers and quality as to rev- 
olutionize the method of teaching.” The press fairly 
teemed with spellers, readers, arithmetics, grammars, 
geographies, and histories, in quantity and quality such 
as had never before been known. American authors 
and American printers had proceeded to win our text- 
book independence as the American statesman and sol- 
dier had won our political independence.! In the matter 
1 Together with the constant improvement in the quality of books up to 
the time of the Revolution, had come a similar increase in the home sup- 
ply. In 1773 Philadelphia, alone, had thirty-eight book-shops, while 
Germantown and Lancaster each had two, and the other larger cities were 
well supplied.
-P-A-G-E-231

of spelling books, the climax was reached with the fa- 
mous “blue-backed speller” of Noah Webster, the 
“beginning of that splendid series of school books 
which now stands unrivalled.” It is interesting to note 
how both political and pedagogical conceptions pre- 
sented themselves to the mind of Noah Webster. In 
the preface to one of his books, he says: — 
“In the choice of pieces, I have been attentive to the political 
interests of America. I consider it as a capital fault in all our 
schools, that the books generally used contain subjects wholly un- 
interesting to our youth.” McMaster, I, 
Pp. 23. 
  It was precisely that attention which gave us the Web- © 
ster’s American Spelling Book, which, next to, if not, 
indeed, surpassing, the Mew England Primer, has been 
the greatest inanimate force in American education. 
This spelling book formed one part of what Webster, 
perhaps as a tribute to dignified, old-fashioned scholar- 
ship, called “ A Grammatical Institute of the English 
Language, comprising an Easy, Concise and Systematic 
Method of Education, designed for the use of English 
Schools in America.” The other two parts were a 
grammar and a reader, though neither attained to any 
great prominence. 
With the Spelling Book, the case was, however, quite 
different, and it is doubtful if, even in modern days of 
big things, any book has had such a phenomenal sale. 
It first appeared in 1785, and although it gained a foot- 
hold comparatively slowly, by 1815 the sales were esti- 
mated at 286,000 copies a year, which number in 1828 
had reached 350,000. In 1847 the statement was made 
that about 24,000,000 copies of the book had been pub- 
lished up to that time, and that the sale was then aver- 
aging 1,000,000 copies a year. The popularity of the 
book continued to the time even of the present genera- 
tion, the sales for the years 1866-1873 aggregating 
8,196,028 copies. By this time, however, competition Scudder, p. 34.
-P-A-G-E-232
  216 The Growth of the People’s Schools 
had become a very different factor from what it had 
been earlier in the history of the book, and sales rapidly 
declined. The American Spelling Book was clearly 
modelled after Dillworth’s, which it succeeded in popu- 
larity ; but was fully Americanized and much less reli- 
gious. It cannot be doubted that Webster felt that he 
had a real mission in its production, and a genuine peda- 
gogic interest in the American people. In its preface, 
he says : — 
“To diffuse an uniformity and purity of language in America, to 
destroy the provincial prejudices that originate in trifling differences 
of dialect, and produce reciprocal ridicule, to promote the interests 
of literature and harmony in the United States is the most earnest 
work of the author, and it is his highest ambition to deserve the 
approbation and encouragement of his countrymen.” 
His attitude toward a modernized form of spelling, as 
expressed in the same preface, would seem to place him 
in the very first rank of spelling reformers. 
“The spelling,” he says, “of such words as publick, favour, 
neighbour, head, prove, phlegm, his, give, debt, rough, and well in- 
stead of the more natural and easy method, public, favor, nabor, 
hed, proov, flem, hiz, giv, det, ruf, wel has the plea of antiquity in 
its favor, and yet 1 am convinced that common sense and conven- 
ience will sooner or later get the better of the present absurd 
practice.” 
It may be said that Webster never had the courage to 
make his book conform to his own principles. With 
such tools as these were the wits of our eighteenth- 
century forefathers sharpened, for the great masses of 
the people never went farther with their schooling than 
these books could take them. Some few other elemen- 
tary books made their appearance, such as Bingham’s 
Columbian Orator, and American Preceptor, Goldsmith’s 
Roman History, and Stanford’s The Art of Reading, but 
their hold was not strong upon the people.

Necessary Art made most easy: being explained in a 
Familiar Way to the capacity of any that desire to learn 
wt in a little Time, was practically the sole contestant 
for honors until nearly the end of the century. The 
first American edition, which was a reprint, appeared in 
Boston in 1719, succeeded by more than twenty-four 
others. 
The first American to produce an arithmetic of any 
prominence was Nicolas Pike. His book, A New and 
Complete Arithmetic composed for the Citizens of the 
United States, was a pretentious volume of 512 pages, 
the first edition appearing in 1788 from a Newburyport, 
Massachusetts, press. The edition was followed by many 
others, printed in various parts of the country, for Pike’s 
Arithmetic was the mathematical‘mentor for more than 
a generation. Of the 500 and more pages of text, 412 
were devoted to arithmetic proper, 60 to plane geometry, 
trigonometry, and mensuration, 33 to algebra, and 10 to 
an introduction to conic sections. The arrangement of 
topics was not materially different from that in our best 
text-books to-day, and on the whole, the book was a 
credit to its author and its time. An interesting feature 
of the earlier edition is the insertion, as an advertise- 
ment, of letters of recommendation and approval from 
various men of note. President Washington, himself, 
was represented by a lengthy and very commendatory 
epistle, while the presidents of Harvard, Yale, Brown, 
Dartmouth, were included in the list. 
Of text-books strictly for schools of a secondary and 
higher grade there were comparatively few, the demand 
being small, and most of these were in the classics. Of 
them all, Cheever’s Accidence was by far the most fa- 
mous, gaining a popularity which carried it far down into 
the nineteenth century (the last edition was published in 
1838). For more than forty years it was practically the 
only beginner’s Latin book in use in the colonies. It 
has been said : —

“His Accidence was the wonder of the age, and though, as his 
biographer and his pupil, Dr. Cotton Mather observed, it had not 
excluded the original grammar, it passed through eightcen editions 
before the Revolution and had been used as generally as any ele- 
mentary work ever known.” 
The book was small, but 79, 12mo pages, and served 
as a Latin primer. This completed, the pupil was pro- 
moted usually to Lilly’s Latin Grammar. This book was 
an English importation, first printed in London in 1755. 
It was in three parts, containing roughly 300 pages, and 
was intended to serve the student until he should have 
acquired a good reading knowledge of the language, and 
be put to the classic texts themselves. 
It would be impossible, within the space available, to 
discuss with any detail the growth of American text- 
books during the nineteenth century. Their titles alone 
would fill a volume. The text-book problems of colonial 
days have solved themselves ; but new conditions have 
given rise to those no less serious. These are both ped- 
agogic and economic: the first has to do, so far as 
the administration of the school goes, with the selection 
of the best, from the mass of the good, bad, and indiffer- 
ent material in the hands of the pupil, at the least expense 
to all concerned. Upon both of these questions much 
legislation has been passed. I shall attempt to do no 
more than state in a general way what it is. Much has 
had to do with the unit of area or administration, for 
which there shall be a uniformity of text-books. 
No state in the Union lacks some sort of prescribed 
uniformity, except Alabama which allows a county op- 
tion in the matter, which but eleven counties have availed 
themselves of. In every other state in the Union we 
have some sort of a prescription, either

Selection and Adoption 
As to selection and adoption, the methods prevailing in 
the several states are in many respects peculiar to them-

  selves. Under district, town, or township uniformity the 
local boards are themselves generally the selecting bod- 
ies ; but in the common districts of New York, the voters 
in annual meeting exercise this function. Pennsylvania 
school boards are supposed to select books in consulta- 
tion with their teachers, and in cities, as in New Eng- 
land, the whole matter is intrusted to the superintendents. 
The “district boards” of Ohio are limited to an open 
list of such books as the state text-book commissioners 
may have previously approved. In Wyoming the state 
superintendent secures samples and quotations of prices 
which he places at the disposal of local boards. 
Of the eight states having county uniformity, four 
have special text-book boards, composed usually of both 
teachers and lay citizens; other states make this a part 
of the duties of the regular county board of education. 
To the latter class belongs Florida, which provides that 
the county superintendent and at least three teachers 
must be consulted. 
Similarly divided also, are those states which have 
complete centralization : Idaho, Kansas, Missouri, Mon- 
tana, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah have special 
text-book boards, while the other eight of the list make 
use of the state board of education. 
Nearly all states having county or state uniformity, 
employ the “bid and contract” system for the purchase 
of books. That is, sample copies and sealed proposals or 
bids from publishers are received by the several boards, 
and both quality and price are considered. California 
alone publishes its own books, by securing the manu- 
scripts; and a similar publication under contract is 
authorized by law in Kansas, Indiana, South Dakota, 
Texas, and Tennessee, and has been tried in Connecti- 
cut in the cases of texts in physiology and hygiene.

  The purchasing of books by pupils in the open mar-

they are provided free in nearly all states. Books are 
furnished free to all in Maine, Delaware, Maryland, 
Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jer- 
sey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wyom- 
ing. By the vote of local school boards, or upon 
authorization by a local popular vote, they may be so 
furnished in Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Iowa, Kan- 
sas, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New York (in 
union districts), North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, 
Washington, and Wisconsin.

COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES 
a. COLONIAL COLLEGES 
Wuen the Puritan emigrated from England to Amer- 
ica, it was a religious conviction that had brought about 
his exile from the mother country. He was still in all 
other respects an Englishman of the times, in whom was 
deeply ingrafted a love for English institutions. Con- 
sequently, when he landed upon the shores of New 
England, he carried there the English tradition and edu- 
cation. The schools he had known at home, he trans- 
planted to America; and it is not strange that the 
university, his alma mater, the latest to touch him edu- 
cationally, and the one which touched him deepest, 
should have been among the first to take root. 
The early settlers of the Massachusetts Bay Colony _ 
were largely educated men. In 1638 there were in the © 
four or five settlements of Massachusetts and Connecti- 
cut, forty or fifty graduates of Cambridge and not a few 
Oxonians; roughly, one in every two hundred and fifty 
of the inhabitants was university bred; a proportion 
three times as large as at the present day. 
The great strength, however, of these men lay, not so 
much in numbers as in the influence which they exerted 
over the whole intellectual life of New England. Cot-

ton, Eliot, Hooker, Williams, Ward, Shepard, and Har- 
vard were from Cambridge; Mathew, ter, and 
Davenport from Oxford, though of inh, 
rather than of the Oxford type. In gene! oth uni- 
versities had much the same aim, method, and curricu- 
lum, but each its distitictive type of thought. As Ox- 
ford had generally inclined toward conservatism, so 
Cambridge had shown decided tendencieS toward tiber- 
alism. Here the doctrines-of, the Reformation were ré= 
ceived much more favorably than at Oxford; and, as a 
consequence, Mary banished the more ardent reformers, 
among whom were the more eminent divines of the 
university. When, under Elizabeth, Cambridge had 
once more met with royal favor, these returned. Many 
of them had, however, spent the term of their banish- 
ment at such Protestant centres as Ziirich, Geneva, 
Frankfort, and Strassburg and come back full of the 
spirit of Calvin and Zwingli. 
Well indeed might Bishop White of Winchester sound 
the note of alarm in Queen Mary’s funeral sermon in 
the words :—   
“The wolves be coming out of Geneva and other places of. Ger- 
many and have sent their books before, full of pestilent doctrine, 
blasphemy, and heresy to infect the people.” 
The return of those exiles meant practically the be- 
ginning of Calvinism in England, which, modified to puri- 
tanism, was destined to bring about such a momentous 
change in the history of the nation in 1649. 
Gradually the Calvinistic party at Cambridge grew 
stronger and began to show positive signs of insubordi- 
nation. Immanuel College, founded_i 583 by Sir 
Walter Mitermmys wes Paras HOA a wears although 
in reply to a query from Elizabeth as to its sentiment,

thereof would be when it became an oak.

No human being could foresee what the “fruit 
thereof” would be, carried not only over all England, 
but across the seas, for Cotton Mather says of the 
college: — 
“If New England hath been in some respects Immanuel’s band, 
it is well; but this I am sure of, Immanuel College contributed more 
than a little to make it so.” 
Harvard College 
It is undoubtedly largely to the intense admiration for, 
and loyalty to, Immanuel College on the part of these 
old worthies that we are indebted for the exact type of 
educational institution known as the American College. 
Other English colleges, to be sure, sent their sons across 
' the water, and university loyalty was not wanting; but 
those who were most active in colonial affairs dated not 
only~their intellectual, but their religious freedom of 
thought to their days at Immanuel, and were hardly set- 
‘tled in their new homes before they set to work to build 
its New World representative. The move originated not 
’ through individual subscription, but through an action 
of of the gene 1. court of Massachusetts, which resulted i in 
The record is as 
      “ The Court agree to give Four Hundred Pounds toward a School 
or College, whereof Two Hundred Pounds shall be paid the next 
year and Two Hundred Pounds when the work is finished, and the 
next Court to appoint where and what building.” 
The next general court appointed twelve of the most 
eminent men of the colony, among them Winthrop, 
Shepard, Cotton, Wilson, Stoughton, and Dudley, “to 
take order for a college at Newtown.” Not very long 
after their appointment, the court changed the name of 
Newtown to Cambridge, “a grateful tribute to the trans- 
Atlantic literary parents of many of the first emigrants,

and indication of the high standing to which they in- 
tended the institution they were establishing should 
aspire. 
But none of the money appropriated by the general 
court had been paid in, nor, indeed, have we any reason 
to believe it ever was paid over, and the appointed over- 
seers were only beginning to give serious attention to 
the establishments of the new college when a dissenting 
clergyman, John Harvard by name, died in Charleston 
(1638) bequeathing one-half his property and his entire 
library to the institution. Although the general court 
had taken action nearly two years before, and popular 
interest in the new college had been aroused, nothing 
visible and tangible had as yet been accomplished ; and 
we probably may, with justice, ascribe the real begin- 
ning of the college to John Harvard’s bequest. 
Of the man but little is known, though it is certain 
that he must have been among the most wealthy of the 
settlers, since his bequest amounted to as much, and 
possibly considerably more, than the entire amount. . 
which the colony was able to pledge. Just how much 
the uncertain records of the times make it impossible to 
Say. 
It is known that Harvard was a graduate of Immanuel 
College ; that he had been in the colonies but one year 
at the time of his death, which was from consumption, 
and that during that year he had taken a prominent 
place among the settlers, having served upon several 
prominent committees. The testimonies of the times 
apply to him the epithets of “reverend,” “ godly,” and 
a “lover of learning.’. 
The catalogue of his library, which document is still 
treasured among the archives of Harvard College, gives 
the titles of 260 volumes, which indicate a breadth of 
scholarship unusual for the period in which he lived. 
Valuable as was this contribution of money and books 
to the course of education in the colonies, the contagion
-P-A-G-E-245
Colleges and Universities 224 
of Harvard’s example seemed almost irresistible, and 
gave rise to an epidemic of benevolence which assured, 
at least, the successful launching of the enterprise. 
The magistrates themselves led the way with a subscrip- 
tion of 4200 in books for the library. The more wealthy 
followed with gifts of £20 and 430. In speaking of 
donations to the college at these times, and in the years 
immediately following, Pierce says : — 
“We read of a number of sheep bequeathed by one man, a quan- 
tity of cotton cloth with 9s. presented by another ; a pewter flagon 
worth tos. by a third ; a fine dish, a sugar spoon, a silver-tipt jug, 
ne great salt, one small trencher salt by others ; and of presents or 
legacies amounting severally to 5s., 9s., £1, £2, etc. What in fact 
were these humble benefactions ? They were contributions from 
the res angusta domi, from pious, virtuous, enlightened penury to the 
noblest of all causes, the advancement of education.” 
And like the widow’s mite, they indicate a respect 
_ and zeal for the object which would have done greater 
things, had the means been more abundant. The in- 
fant institution was first under the superintendency of 
Nathaniel Eaton, of unsavory memory. The man seems 
to have been unfitted in every way for the work which 
he had undertaken; and in 1640 was fined and dis- 
missed from service for brutally flogging one of the 
ushers. 
In that year Henry Dunster arrived in the colony, 
and soon after accepted the presidency of the college, 
now dignified by that title, and called after Harvard since 
1638. Under his administration the first code of laws 
was formed; rules for admission and principles on which 
degrees should be granted established. 
Dunster was an indefatigable worker; and during the 
fourteen years of his presidency carried the institution 
from what were scarcely more than pre-natal squirmings, 
to at least a healthy infancy. He acted not only as 
executive head but principal member of the teaching 
force, with eminent success. His salary seems never to

have been more than 460 per annum, and judging from 
the frequent interchanges of letters between him and 
the officers of the general court concerning its payment, 
he never received the full amount for any one year, and 
finally laid down his office with the college considerably 
his debtor. Early in his administration (1642) was held 
the first commencement, at which the earliest degrees 
granted in the colonies were bestowed upon nine men of 
the first classis. In the same year the control of the 
college was vested in a board of overseers by act of the 
general court. It consisted of the “ Governor, Deputy 
Governor, Magistrates of the Jurisdiction, and the Teach- 
ing Elders of the six adjoining towns.” This body was, 
however, found to be too large for practical purposes, 
and in 1650 an act was passed by which the college was 
made a corporation, consisting of the president, five 
fellows, and a treasurer or bursar, to have perpetual 
succession by the election of members to supply vacan- 
cies, and to be called by the name of “ The President 
and Fellows of Harvard College.” Their acts were, 
however, subject to the approval of the board of over- 
seers, which was continued. In 1654 President Dunster, 
having publicly expressed himself as opposed to the 
baptism of infants, was sentenced to public admoni- 
tion on lecture day, and forced to resign the presidency 
of the college. His remaining years were spent in 
Scituate as a preacher of the gospel; and upon his 
death, in 1659, his remains were carried back to Cam- 
bridge at his own request, and interred near the college 
which he had served so well. President Chauncey, who 
succeeded Dunster at the college, was a man of much 
training, sometime Professor of Greek at Trinity Col- 
lege, Cambridge, but since 1838 preacher at Plymouth 
and at Scituate. About to return to England in 1654, he 
was earnestly entreated by the general court to under- 
take the presidency of the college; and, having been 
promised an adequate salary, accepted.

The position he held until 1672, and his term of office 
seems to have been a period of severe struggle for 
sufficient funds to keep the institution on its feet. 
Of the general court, and the nature and degree of 
the patronage which the college received from it 
during the early years, justice and truth require us to 
speak in terms of respect and honor, although, in fact, 
the bounty and favor were only an intelligent self- 
interest in an institution with whose prosperity its own 
and that of the country were inseparably identified. 
With respect to grants of money, the patronage of the 
general court during the first period certainly never 
exceeded, and there is no documentary evidence to show 
that it equalled, the annual payment of A100 until the 
year 1673. These payments, with the income of the 
ferry, were the only revenues of a permanent character 
which the institution possessed for the purposes of the 
president and officers. 
In the sore straits in which the college found itself 
during President Chauncey’s administration, the town of 
  Quincy, (I) Vol 
I, p. 39 
Portsmouth, New Hampshire, came to its aid in a man-_ 
ner which should bring gratitude to the heart of every 
Harvard alumnus, and indeed to that of every one who 
has an interest in higher education. Ina letter addressed 
to the general court, and dated at Portsmouth, in May, 
1667, the citizens of that town, after expressing their 
gratitude for the protection extended them by Massachu- 
setts, say, that “although they had articled with them 
for the exemption of taxes, yet they had never articled 
with God and their own consciences for exemption 
from gratitude, which, while they were studying how to 
demonstrate, the loud groans of the college came to 
their ears, and hoping that their example might provoke 
the rest of the country to an holy emulation in so good 
a work, and the General Court itself, vigorously to act, 
for the diverting of the omen of calamity, which its 
destruction would be to New England,” declare that a
-P-A-G-E-248
    230 fligher and Special Education 
voluntary collection had been taken among their inhab- 
itants, which authorized the town to pledge the payment 
of “sixty pounds sterling a year for seven years ensuing 
to be improved by the Overseers of the college for the 
advancement of good literature there.” 
This generous example was followed by many, and 
measures were immediately adopted for systematically 
raising funds throughout the colony for a new building 
to take the place of the old wooden one, it being small 
and decayed. In consequence, however, of the Indian 
wars, then raging, the new “Harvard Hall” was not 
finished until 1677. This building stood till 1764, when 
it was destroyed by fire. With Chauncey ended the 
régime of foreign presidents, the institution having fur- 
nished its own since his day. His successor, Dr. Sam- 
uel Hoar, having taken his bachelor’s degree in 1650, 
later going to England, where Cambridge granted him 
the Doctorate of Medicine, he returned to this country 
as an applicant for the presidency of his alma mater, 
bringing with him letters of recommendation from thir- 
teen clergymen, and was successful in his candidacy. 
For some reason or other he seems to have lacked the 
good will of the student body from the very first, and 
“In 1685 Rev. Cotton Mather wasasked “ to take special 
care of the government of the college, and for that end, 
to act as President of it.” This he did for sixteen years, 
| though a resident minister of Boston throughout prac- 
| tically the entire period. 
| The early presidents of the college must be regarded 
as men of unusual attainment for their time. Although 
the number of students for the first half-century was 
small, seldom, if ever, during that period exceeding 
twenty, to be the sole instructor for even so many was 
no light task, and there was no professor or tutor / 
appointed until 1699. ——_——__—" 
In that year Henry Flint was appointed first tutor,
-P-A-G-E-249
Colleges and Universities 231 
and held the position for fifty-four years. No professor- 
ship was established until 1721, when Edward Wiggles- 
worth was made Hollis Professor of Divinity. During 
the greater part of the eighteenth century the college 
was closely identified with the liberal movements, both 
in politics and religion, and bore an important part in 
the events which led up to the Revolution. In 1775 the 
library and classes were removed to Concord, the college 
halls given up to the use of the provincial army, and the 
president’s home occupied for a short while as Wash- 
ington’s headquarters. President Langdon, himself an 
ardent patriot, served as chaplain to the troops on 
numerous occasions, notably on the eve of the battle of 
Bunker Hill. After the evacuation of Boston by the 
British, the college resumed its sessions at Cambridge, 
and maintained for the ensuing thirty years a high, but 
hardly growing reputation, as a seat of learning. For 
the latter part of the period the graduating classes aver- 
aged about forty. Living salaries were provided for the 
president and three professors ; those of divinity, mathe- 
matics, and Oriental languages. Albert Gallatin, after- 
ward Secretary of the United States Treasury, taught 
French as an elective, receiving the fees as his pay. At 
this time the first three years of the course were given 
largely to Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, the freshmen add- 
ing arithmetic, the sophomores algebra and higher mathe- 
matics, and the juniors some natural science. The 
senior year was given mainly to philosophy. All three 
years had more or less oratory and history. In 1782 
a medical department was founded with meagre endow- 
ments and scanty equipment, though not until 1831 was 
the medical faculty regarded as distinct from the college. 
The era of active and incessant growth may be said 
to have begun with President Kirkland in 1810. Of

of the funds invested in buildings and grounds, almost 
the entire amount has accrued from private liberality. 
The gifts of the colonial and provincial governments 
were scanty, and for temporary purposes, if we except 
the erection of a few buildings. The principal gift of 
the state of Massachusetts was $10,000 a year for ten 
years, voted in 1814. From a part of this fund the 
present University Hall was erected, which remains 
the chief enduring monument of state generosity. 
Until 1865, Harvard was nominally under state con- 
trol; but in that year a complete divorce took place 
through legislative action. Under it, bachelors of arts 
of five years’ standing, elect each commencement day 
five members of the board, who hold office for six 
years. These need not even be residents of the state. 
Thus, after many changes, the government of the 
University is no longer connected with either church or 
state, except that this general court of Massachusetts 
retains the power to allow it—a power, however, which 
the court does not seek to exercise without the consent 
of the University itself. 
At present, six degrees are awarded on recommenda- 
tion of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the body 
to which is committed the administration of academic 
functions. The courses offered in the college—and 
there are more than five hundred —ordinarily lead to 
the degree of Bachelor of Arts after a four years’ study, 
though a considerable percentage of the students attain 
it in less time. The courses in the Lawrence Scientific 
School lead to the degree of Bachelor of Science, while 
to properly qualified students in the Graduate School 
those of Master and Doctor of Arts and of Science are 
offered.

faculties.

four years for its completion and the attainment of the 
degree, Doctor of Medicine.

may, after passing the required examination, obtain the 
degree of Bachelor of Agricultural Science. The 
courses cover scientific agriculture, landscape gardening, 
and chemistry and natural history as applied to those arts. 
The growth of Harvard University, under the long 
administration of President Eliot, has been rapid and 
healthy, and it must probably be placed at the head of 
the higher institutions of learning in our country, not 
only in point of age but of general influence. 
It had, in 1904, 5966 students registered in all depart- 
ments, with a teaching force of 534. The library con- 
tained 607,100 volumes, by far the largest of any of our 
educational institutions, and ranking third in the country 
among libraries of all classes. It has graduated, since 
its foundation, 25,180 students, 14,662 of whom are still 
living, a veritable army of educated men. Its produc- 
tive funds amount to $13,119,538. Radcliffe College, 
the affiliated department for women, was incorporated 
with power to grant degrees in 1894. 
Harvard offers 205 scholarships to undergraduates, 
the annual income from which is $47,755. There are 
also 41 fellowships in the graduate school, varying in 
value from $300 to $1000. P. 318.

Besides these, about $2800 annually —the income of 
various gifts which the college has received from time 
to time — is turned over to deserving students, usually in 
sums not to exceed $50, and a loan fund makes availa- 
ble for student needs an equal sum in addition. In all, 
Harvard contributes annually nearly $80,000 to the sup- 
port of its students. 
William and Mary 
Although the college of William and Mary, the sec- 
ond to be established in the colonies, has not been able 
to hold its own in point of student body, with most of its 
other early contemporaries, its intimate connection with 
colonial matters in Virginia, and its almost unequalled 
contribution of patriots to the cause of independence, 
places it in the very front rank of institutions of the 
anti-revolutionary times. The events leading up to the 
establishment of the college have already been given, 
extending back, at least in definite anticipation, to a 
time antedating by some years the establishment of 
Harvard. After all previous attempts to found a col- 
lege in Virginia had come to nought, the colonial assem- 
bly conceived the fortunate idea of sending James Blair, 
a clergyman of high standing, to England to see what 
could be done there, both in the direction of securing a 
charter, and moneys for carrying out its privileges. 
Blair, who was a man of unusual ability, as shown Foth | 
by the success of this mission and by his subsequent 
administration of the college, succeeded beyond all 
hope; he returned in 1693 with a charter signed by. their 
Majesties, William and Mary, together with the snug 
little sum of 42000 “out of the rents,” for the erection 
of buildings. 
Seymore, the attorney-general for the Crown, vexed at 
what seemed to him the extravagance of their Majesties 
at a time when an expensive war was being waged and
-P-A-G-E-253
  Colleges and Universities 235 
every cent needed, flew into a rage upon the presen- 
tation of the order for the money by Mr. Blair, telling 
him that the funds were needed for “other and better 
purposes” than the founding of a colonial college. Upon 
the reply by Blair that “the people of Virginia had souls 
to be saved,” the irate custodian of the Crown’s purse 
is said to have given vent to the now historical exclama- 
tion, “Souls! Damn your souls! Make fodacco/” In 
spite, however, of the attorney-general, Blair came home 
with both the charter and the money. This latter, with 
#2500, and perhaps more, which had already been 
subscribed by wealthy planters in Virginia, gave the 
college, at its start, more wealth than Harvard had 
seen during decades of struggle for existence, and freed 
it from many of the problems which had been most 
~ perplexing to the New England college. The charter 
stated as objects of the college, “that the church of 
Virginia may be furnished with a seminary of MinistersV 
of the Gospel, and that the youth may be properly edu- 
cated in good manners, and that the Christian faith may 
be propagated among the Western Indians to the glory 
of Almighty God: to make, found and establish a cer- 
tain place of universal study or perpetual college of 
divinity, philosophy, languages and other good arts and 
sciences.” The officers were to consist of chancellor, 
eighteen visitors or governors, a president or rector, and 
six professors, who were to teach one hundred students. 
The Bishop of London was appointed as first chancel- 
lor, for seven years, and Blair was “created and estab- 
lished first president of the college during his natural 
life.” Financially, the institution was well provided for 
by the terms of the charter, for besides valuable lands, 
it was to receive all fees from the surveyor-general’s 
office, and one penny per pound for all tobaccos exported 
from Virginia and Maryland. In return for this munifi- 
cence — for so it must have seemed when tidings of it 
reached its elder brother in the Massachusetts colony —  
-P-A-G-E-254
  2c 
  236 Higher and Special Education 
was demanded one slight and fantastic service which 
serves to throw light on the ceremonialism of the times ; 
it was that there should be delivered “to us and our 
successors two copies of Latin verses yearly, on every 
fifth day of November at the house of our Governor or 
Lieutenant-Governor for the time being.” We are not 
aware that any important contribution to the literature 
of the period resulted from this demand ; but that it was 
complied with for at least half a century is shown by 
an item which appeared in the Virginia Gazette as late 
as 1746. It runs: — 
“On this day Se’n night, being the 6th of November, the president, 
masters, and scholars of William and Mary College, went according 
to their annual custom in a body to the Governor’s, to present his 
Honor with two copies of Latin verses in obedience to their charter. 
The President delivered the verses to his Honor, and two of the 
young gentlemen spoke them.” 
The site chosen for the college was Williamsburg, the 
colonial capitol, and the plans for the buildings which 
Were eventually “to be an entire square” were drawn, 
by Sir. Christopher Wren. In 1705 the first building 
was destroyed by fire, together with its entire contents 
of books and apparatus. Of the course of study at 
William and Mary during its colonial history, we have 
but little record, but if “the proof of the pudding is in 
the eating,” it must have been of the sort that makes 
men, for the story of its graduates is the story of lead- 
ers in the movement for independence. 
Of eleven members of the Committee of Correspond- 
ence appointed by Virginia in 1773, six, including the 
chairman, Peyton Randolph, were from William and 
Mary; of the Committee of Safety appointed two years 
later, six out of eleven; of the thirty-one members of 
the committee reporting the Declaration of Rights, the 
chairman and ten others; out of the seven signers of 
the Declaration of Independence from Virginia, the 
draftsman of the paper, and four others. Of the thirty- 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
  Colleges and Universities 237 
three members of the Continental Congress from the 
state, the first president of that body and fifteen others 
were alumni. 
Of seven Presidents of the United States born in Vir- 
ginia, three, Jefferson, Monroe, and Tyler, —as well as 
John Marshall, the jurist, — were from the same classic 
halls ; altogether a galaxy of men of national reputation 
not to be equalled in any alumni list of the size in the 
country; a fact due in part to the location of the col- 
lege at the focus of patriotic enthusiasm. 
In 1776 the first Greek letter fraternity, Phi Beta 
Kappa, now having chapters in fifty American colleges, 
and to which only the men (and women) of highest 
scholastic attainments are admitted, was founded at the 
college. 
The influence of William and Mary remained promi- 
nent in Virginia until the time of the Civil War, although 
the University of Virginia had become a strong competi- 
tor for honors. During that conflict, the buildings were 
again burned and the work suspended, to be revived 
again after a cessation of hostilities. From that time 
it has held an honorable, though comparatively unim- 
portant place in the rapidly increasing circle of higher 
institutions of learning in our country. In 1904 it had 
an enrolment of 165 students, a faculty of 13, and pro- 
ductive funds amounting to $133,500. 
Yale College 
Although a number of attempts had been made in 
the Connecticut Colony in the middle of the seventeenth 
century to found a college there, in connection with one 
of which a plot of ground was set apart for the purpose 
and with another, a fund raised which eventually went 
to Harvard, nothing was accomplished until 1701. Early 
in the summer of that year the Rev. James Pierpont, 
pastor of the New Haven church, a Harvard graduate  
-P-A-G-E-256

Eliot, (I) p. 47. 
  238 Fligher and Special Education 
of 1681, and Abraham Pierson (Harvard, 1668), becom- 
ing convinced that the time had come for the establish- 
ment of a second college in New England, entered into 
communication with other interested persons in southern 
Connecticut and brought about a meeting at Branford, 
the next town east of New Haven, in September, to 
consider the project. Tradition says that each appeared 
at the conference with one or more books which were 
given as a foundation for the new institution. At a 
subsequent meeting the details were considered; and 
on October 16 a charter was granted for a Collegiate 
School, by the legislature in session at New Haven. 
A month later, seven of the trustees, established un- 
der the charter, met at Saybrook and voted to fix the 
school there, under the Rev. Mr. Pierson as rector. 
No student appeared until March, when Jacob Hemin- 
way offered himself. On the 16th of the following 
September commencement exercises were held in Say- 
brook, at which time the Master of Arts degree was 
conferred upon four young Harvard bachelors, and also 
upon Nathaniel Chauncy, who had been privately edu; 
cated, and whose name leads the list of Yale graduates. 
During the same month more students entered, and a 
tutor was appointed to assist in instruction. 
With the exception of £120 in “country pay” from 
the colonial legislature, as promised by the charter, 
financial support was entirely from the tuition of the 
students, which was 30s. for undergraduates and Ios. for 
graduates. These did not warrant the rector’s resigning 
his pastoral charge; so, until the date of his death in 
1707, he resided in Killingworth. 
For the next ten years it would be difficult to name 
the real seat of the college. The twenty-five or thirty 
students were scattered over a number of towns in the 
vicinity of New Haven. As President Hadley has face- 
tiously put it: —
-P-A-G-E-257
Colleges and Universities 239 
“Yale college was founded after a fashion, at the beginning of the 
last (eighteenth) century, along the north shore of Long Island 
Sound. For many years it was difficult to say what it was and where 
it belonged.” 
After the death of the first rector, — for so the highest 
officer was called, for fear that an institution of learning 
dignified with a president would attract notice in Eng- 
land, which would prejudice its charter, — Rev. Samuel 
Andrew was appointed to the position. He was pastor 
at Milford. The senior class went to him there, while 
the two lower classes remained at Saybrook, at first 
with but one, but later with two, tutors. Of the course 
of study at this period of Yale’s history, we have some 
account from a letter written to President Stiles in the 
year 1779 by a graduate of the class of 1714. 
“Books of the languages recited in my Day were Tully and Vir- 
gil, but without any notes: Burgersdicius and Ramur’s Lagick, also 
Hereford’s Set Logic, ete., Pierson’s Manuscript of Physicks. We 
recited the Greek Testament; knew not Homer; recited the Psalms 
in Hebrew; the greatest ‘proficient in the Hebrew and in other lan- 
guages was Dr. Johnson. \ We recited Ames’s Medu/la on Saturdays 
and also his Cases of Conscience ; sometimes the two upper classes 
used to dispute syllogistically twice or thrice a week.” 
During all these years, the college was without build- 
ings of its own, and in 1716, when the question of erect- 
ing a permanent home\came up, the colony itself was 
almost rent in twain by the fight which was waged. 
Three towns, Hartford, New Haven, and Saybrook, were 
openly in the field, while| Wethersfield and Middletown 
entertained hopes, and the general assembly had great 
difficulty in settling the question, which they finally did 
in 1717, in favor of New Haven. 
At about this time Elihu. Yale began his bequests 
to the college, and eventually fixed it in history with 
his name. He was born in Boston in 1649, moved to 
England with his parents a few years later, entered 
the employ of the East India Company as a youth, Steiner, (I) p.75.

and returned to England in later life enormously 
wealthy, at least for the times. He seems not to have 
been a man of education nor refinement, as was the 
first great benefactor of the Massachusetts college; 
nevertheless, kindly disposed toward education in the 
colonies, he was induced, largely through the instru- 
mentality of Cotton Mather, to come to the aid of the 
college in New Haven, which was especially impover- 
ished through the building which was in process of con- 
struction. Just before the commencement season of 
1718, Yale sent to Boston from England three bales of 
valuable goods to be sold for the college. There were 
besides, a portrait of George I, which the university 
still has, the royal coat of arms which was destroyed 
during the Revolution, and a case of books. The goods 
brought £562, which was immediately used in the col- 
lege building. Of the gift, Steiner says :— 
“Tt seems to us small in comparison with endowments to-day, 
but we must remember that the college received no greater gift from 
an individual for over a century and that the gift came at a critical 
time. Without this gift, the trustees could not have finished the 
building at once, and every moment of delay would have strength- 
ened the Wethersfield faction. This gift crushed it forever.” 
Later in the same year more goods were sent over, 
from which A100 were realized, and at his death Yale 
bequeathed £500 to the college, but through some diffi- 
culty in probating the will, this was never received. 
With these benefactions, and £618 which had been 
received from a grant of land made by the general 
assembly in 1613, the college was in better condition 
financially than even the most sanguine of its early pro- 
moters could have hoped. The building, a wooden 
structure of three stories containing a chapel, dining 
room, a library, and twenty-two studies with adjoining 
bedrooms, was completed and occupied in 1719. It 
stood until the time of the Revolution, and is said to 
have had “an air of grandeur.”
-P-A-G-E-259
Colleges and Universities 241 
  The remaining years of the Collegiate Institute, for 
so the college continued to be known until the granting 
of its charter as Yale College in 1745, comprise a 
period of slow progress and many internal dissensions 
of a religious nature. Of the inner life of the college 
at this time we have some record. Board in the com- 
mons cost about 5s. per week, tuition 50s. annually, 
and the fees at graduation about 40s. more. To gain 
admission students must “be found expert in both ye 
Greek and lattin Grammers, as also grammatically re- 
solving both lattin and Greek authors and in making 
good and true lattin. Every student shall exercise him- 
self in reading Holy Scriptures by himself day by day 
yt ye word of Christ may Dwell in Him ritchly.” 
Students are to “avoid profane swearing, lying, need- 
less asserveration, foolish garrulings, Chidings, strifes, 
railings, jestings, uncomly noise, spreading ill rumors, 
Divulging secrets, and all manner of troublesome and 
offensive behavior.” ‘No undergraduate shall, upon 
pretense of Recreation or any excuse whatever ” without 
permission “be absent from his study or appointed ex- 
ercise in ye school, except Half an Hour att breakfast, 
and Half an Hour at Noon after dinner and after ye 
Evening Prayer till nine of ye clock.” 
Prayers were at 6 A.M. in summer and at sunrise in 
winter, and between 4 and 5 p.m. No student could be 
out of his room after 9 p.m., nor have “a light in his 
chamber after eleven nor before four in ye morning.” 
“ All undergraduates except freshmen who shall read 
English into Greek, shall read some part of ye old testa-

studied principally “ Phisicks ” while the seniors labored 
over “metaphysicks and mathematics, still carrying ye 
former studies.” The last days of the week were used 
by all for “ Rhetorick, oratory and divinity.” 
In 1738 the trustees ruled that no student should be 
admitted without the signature of some responsible per- 
son upon his bond for the payments of his dues, a pro- 
vision still in force. 
In 1731 Bishop Berkeley, then a resident of Rhode 
Island, having despaired of his Bermuda project, became 
interested in the college at New Haven; and upon re- 
turning to Europe, made a bequest of a number of 
books. In a letter to Dr. Johnson, he said :— 
“T have left a box of books to be given away by you. The Greek 
and Latin books I would have given to such lads as you think will 
make the best use of them, or to the school at New Haven.” 
Besides this, he made out a deed conveying his Rhode 
Island farm of ninety-six acres to the college, the income 
from the sale of which was to be devoted to “these schol- 
ars for their maintenance between first and second de- 
gree,” the fund still being used for that purpose. 
In 1745, nearly twenty-four years after the death of 
its first great benefactor, a new charter was granted the 
college, which formally changed its name to Yale College 
in New Haven. By it, Rector Clap and the ten other 
trustees then in office were constituted “an incorporate 
society or body corporate and politic: and shall here- 
after be known by the name of President and Fellows 
of Yale College of New Haven,” and were given the 
power to appoint “a scribe or register, a treasurer, tutors, 
professors, steward, and all other such officers and ser- 
vants as are usually appointed in colleges and Universi- 
ties” to “make, ordain and establish all such rules and 
ordinances as they shall think proper for the instruction 
and education of the students and the ordering, govern-
-P-A-G-E-261
  Colleges and Universities 243 
ing, ruling and arranging of the said college act, which 
shall be laid before this assembly as often as required 
and may also be repealed or disallowed by the assembly 
when they shall think proper.” The charter also re- 
pealed all former grants of money from the state and 
appropriated £100 revenue annually. Three years 
later a second building was erected (1748), at first known 
as Connecticut Hall, later by the familiar title of South 
Middle. In 1763 a chapel was erected. 
All during this period, and in fact until 1804, the so- 
called “Freshman Laws” were in force. These were 
a set of rules enforced by the student body itself, and 
resembling in many respects those of the fagging sys- 
tem in the great English public schools. 
Among them we find : — 
“A Freshman shall not play with any member of an upper class 
without being asked, nor is he permitted to use any acts of familiarity 
with them, even in study time.” “Freshmen are obliged to perform 
all reasonable errands for any superior, always returning an account 
of the same to the person who sent them.” “When a Freshman is 
near a gate or door belonging to College or College-Yard he shall 
look around and observe whether any of his superiors are coming to 
the same, and, if any are coming within three rods, he shall not 
enter without a signal to proceed.” ‘Freshmen shall not run in 
college yard nor up and down stairs or call to any through a window.” 
“Jt being the duty of Seniors to teach the Freshmen the laws and 
usages and customs of the college, to this end they are empowered 
to order the whole Freshman class or any member of it in order to 
be instructed or reproved at such time and place as they shall appoint, 
when and where every Freshman shall attend, answer all proper 
questions and behave decently.” 
All this sounds very queer to the modern freshman, 
yet some such system intelligently administered in many 
of our higher institutions of to-day might not be out of 
place. The value of a college education is due fully as 
much to college life as to classroom instruction, and the 
subtle something which makes the graduate of our older 
institutions, where ancient customs still persist, look

back upon his college days with an almost increasing 
affection, comes largely from the former. 
During the Revolutionary period the work of the col- 
lege was again scattered. ‘Tutor Dwight” took some 
of the students to Wethersfield; Professor Story was 
asked to go to Glastonbury, and President Daggett was 
“to visit the different classes as often as he could with 
convenience.” 
With the inauguration of Timothy Dwight as presi- 
dent in 1795, Yale began a new era of prosperity. At 
that time the whole student body numbered only about 
one hundred, and the faculty consisted of the president, 
one professor, and three tutors. Dwight was, however, 
a man of unusual insight, which he manifested first and 
foremost through a building up and a strengthening of 
the faculty. Up to this time there had been little per- 
manency in the teaching force. He conceived the idea 
of securing good men for the teaching positions and 
making them feel that their life-work was to be the 
building up of the hitherto strug’ling institution. In 
that he succeeded beyond all precedent, as the names of 
Benjamin Silliman, Jeremiah Day, and James Kingsley, 
each devoting more than fifty years to the service of the 
college, amply testify. With such a group of workers, it is 
no wonder that the succeeding generation of Yale gradu- 
ates number many of the most famous men of the time. 
President Dwight gives in his travels an outline of the 
course of study which shows marked improvement over 
that of a century before. 
From this time the development of Yale was steadily 
in the direction of the great university which it is to-day. 
The name was changed to Yale University in 1886. In 
1846 regular graduate courses of instruction were estab- 
lished, the first degrees being awarded in 1852. The 
Sheffield Scientific School, always what its name im- 
plies rather than a technical school, was founded in 
1847 on a codrdinate basis with the college.
-P-A-G-E-263
  Colleges and Universities 245 
Four professional schools are maintained: the Medi- 
cal, the Theological, and the Legal, all established dur- 
ing President Timothy Dwight’s administration, and the 
Art School in 1865. 
In 1904, 2975 students were registered at Yale, doing 
work under an instructional force of 325. The library 
contained 365,000 volumes. It had graduated in its 
history 20,900 students, of whom 11,900 were still alive. 
Its productive funds amounted to $5,000,000. 
Princeton College 
The educational influences which led to the establish- 
ment of the College of New Jersey, later Princeton, may 
be traced to the famous Log College of William Tennent, P. 330.

pastor of Neshaminy; the religious influences, to the - 
Presbyterian church, which throughout the middle col- 
onies served as a more potent unifying factor among 
great classes of the people than did even loyalty to 
kings. 
The Log College was unique in the history of Ameri- 
can education. Tennent was an Irishman, born in 1673, 
graduated from Edinburgh in 1695, who came to Amer- 
ica in 1716, and in 1727 was settled as pastor of a Pres- 
byterian church, at what was known as the Forks of the 
Neshaminy. His high views of a liberal education, to- 
gether with a desire to give its benefits to his sons, led 
him soon after his settlement to open a school of higher 
learning and of divinity. He built a log structure which, 
with Tennent himself, composed the entire plant and 
teaching force during the twenty years of the school’s 
existence. George Whitfield, who visited Tennent, as 
he said in his journal, “at the place where young men 
study now,” describes the school as follows : — 
“It is alog house about twenty feet long, and near as broad ; and 
to me it resembled the school of the Hebrew prophets. From this 
despised place seven or eight ministers of Jesus have lately been P. 64.

sent forth, more are almost ready to be sent and a foundation is now 
being laid for the instruction of many others.” 
  With the death of Tennent, some time in the ’40’s, 
the school went out of existence ; and so completely has 
the Log College been effaced, that the exact site of the 
structure is not known. 
It had, however, done two things: proved beyond a 
doubt that the church need not depend upon the old 
country for its ministers, and demonstrated that the ma- 
chinery of a successful college need not be elaborate 
nor beyond the reach of the people. Neither one of 
these things was lost upon the stanch Presbyterians of 
East and West Jersey, and the college at Princeton was 
the result. Its birth was not an easy one, and the story 
of dissensions regarding charter and location is long. 
But in 1748 a charter was secured—the one under 
which, with but slight alteration, Princeton to-day is ad- 
ministered—and its work inaugurated, at Elizabethtown. 
Of the twenty-three first trustees, six were graduates of 
Yale, three of Harvard, and three received their train- 
ing under Tennent at the Log College. 
The first statement of entrance requirements shows 
that they did not differ materially from those of Har- 
vard and Yale. The candidate must be able to render 
Virgil and Cicero’s orations into English ; translate Eng- 
lish into trug and grammatical Latin; translate the gos- 
pels into Latin or English, and give the grammatical 
construction of the words. The curriculum was in har- 
mony with the standard of admission; Latin and Greek, 
and mathematics were studied throughout the entire 
course. Physical science was represented by natural 
philosophy and astronomy; logic was studied with a 
text-book, and its practice secured by discussions. 
Rhetoric was taught in the same way, and essays and 
declamations were required; mental and moral philos- 
ophy were prominent studies of the higher classes.

  Colleges and Universities 247 
From a letter, written in 1750, by a member of the 
freshman class, we get some idea of the daily programme 
of studies : — 
“But I must give you an account of my studies at the present 
time. At seven in the morning we recite to the president, lessons 
in the works of Xenophon in Greek, and in Watts’ Ontology. The 
rest of the morning, until dinner time, we study Cicero’s De Oratore 
and the Hebrew grammar, and recite our lessons to Mr. Sherman, 
the college tutor. The remaining part of the day we spend in the 
study of Xenophon and ontology to recite the next morning. And, 
besides these things, we dispute once every week after the syllogistic 
method ; —and now and then learn geography.” 
As was the case with so many of the colonial col- 
leges, the place of permanent location remained a 
matter of controversy until the time came to erect a 
building. With the college of New Jersey, this was in 
1751. 
In May of that year the trustees selected New Bruns- 
wick, ‘‘ Provided the citizens of the place secure to the 
college #1000 in proclamation money, ten acres for a 
college campus, and two hundred acres of good land not 
more than three miles from the town.” 
The town of Princeton, however,; bestirred itself, 
agreed to exceed the demands, and in 1752 was finally 
chosen. Two years later the present Nassau Hall was 
begun, and finished in 1757, being at the time the finest 
edifice of any character in the colonies, and remaining 
to-day one of the most venerable and imposing of all 
our myriad of college buildings. Twice since its erec- 
tion, in 1802 and in 1855, its interior has been destroyed 
by fire, but the honest workmanship of its first builders 
has preserved it in external appearance as it came from 
the masons. The money required for its construction 
was raised largely by subscription; about 42000 in 
England and Ireland, and £400 in the provinces. 
The building was first occupied in 1756, opening with 
seventy students, while at the first commencement at

  Eliot, (I) p. 200. Princeton, twenty-two were graduated. During the fol- 
lowing year Rev. Jonathan Edwards was chosen presi- 
dent, but died within two months of his installation. 
Although this was by far the shortest presidential term, 
frequent changes in the executive office had been the 
rule, and when, in 1768, John Witherspoon was installed 
president, he was the sixth in a little more than twenty 
years. His administration was notable both for its 
length (closed in 1794) and for the important chapters 
in American history which it helped to write, for no 
other of our colleges has ever in its history been so 
intimately associated with national events of the first 
importance as was Princeton during Witherspoon’s 
presidency. Situated as it was in the geographical 
centre of the colonies, near the seat of the Continental 
Congress, it was closely in touch with every move toward 
colonial freedom, and early became an intellectual breed- 
ing-place for patriots. This was undoubtedly due, in 
part, to two societies, the Well Meaning and the Plain 
Dealing Clubs, out of which later grew the present 
Cliosophic and American Whig societies, which as early 
as 1764 had fought out in mimic on their respective 
platforms the political problems which were now to be 
settled on the battlefield. Witherspoon himself was an 
ardent patriot, besides being a man of great reputation 
as a teacher and philosopher; and his reputation soon 
helped the college into a position of prominence which 
it had not before occupied. The teaching force in- 
creased, endowments were secured, and a larger body 
of students was attracted and were drawn from a wider 
territory. Of the relation of Princeton and its venerable 
Nassau Hall to the political events of the time, Professor 
Sloan has written :— 
“When first completed it (Nassau) was visited by travellers as 
the largest building then in the colonies. Within the walls of this 
now venerable and stately pile were quartered the troops of con- 
tending British and Americans in the Revolutionary War. The
-P-A-G-E-267
  
  Colleges and Universities 249 
Continental Congress used it for their sittings when driven from Phila- 
delphia, and adjourned in 1783 to attend the college commencement 
in a body. Its walls still bear the imprints of cannon balls used in 
the battle of Princeton, and on them hangs a portrait of Washington, 
painted by Peale. It was paid for by the money given as a personal 
gift by the former for the use of the building by his troops, and fills 
a frame which once contained an effigy of George II. Nine signers 
of the Declaration of Independence frequented its halls — two were 
graduates and three were officers of the corporation which controlled 
it — and its windows blazed with light in a grand illumination when 
the news of the signing reached the town. Aaron Burr studied in 
its classroom ; and his body was borne from its walls to a neighboring 
churchyard.” 
The funds of the college, as well as its buildings, 
suffered greatly during the Revolutionary period. Its 
library was scattered, its apparatus destroyed, and the 
state of New Jersey appropriated the sum of £600 
annually for three years for their restoration, an act 
which must be considered more in the light of the pay- 
ment for debt than as a donation. The student body 
was gradually increasing, and in 1806 had reached the 
number of 200, with a graduating class of 54. The 
faculty consisted of a president, four professors, three 
tutors, and an instructor in French. 
~.. Somewhat later, the college passed through a period 
of depression, when less than 75 students were in attend- 
ance; but from the year 1830 or thereabouts, there has 
been a steady, though at no time a very rapid, increase. 
During its later history Princeton has had many noted 
men at its head, among whom Dr. McCosh (1868-1888) 
perhaps stands at the head. Of his administration we 
find the following minutes of faculty action taken at his Murray, (1) 
death in 1894:— P. 27%. 
“The results of his presidency have made a new epoch in our 
history. The college has virtually become a university. Its faculty 
has been trebled in numbers. Its alumni and friends have rallied 
around it with new loyalty. Munificent gifts have poured into its 
treasury. Schools of science, of philosophy, of art, of civil and elec: 
trical engineering have been founded with endowed professorships ;

fellowships, and prizes, and an ample equipment of libraries, numer- 
ous laboratories, chapel dormitories, academic halls, and athletic

of his energy which other college generations after us will continue 
to admire.” 
Princeton has no professional schools, though the 
Theological Seminary, a separate corporation, is closely 
affiliated with it. It has always stood for conservatism 
in matters of instruction, and its courses are less elastic 
than are those of most of the great universities. 
In 1904, 1565 students were enrolled. The faculty 
numbered 108. It has an alumni list of 8733, of whom 
5023 are living. The number of scholarships yielding 
free tuition is about 80, while 12 graduate-fellowships 
are maintained. In addition to these, about $3500 is 
annually distributed through prizes and medals as an 
inspiration to earnest, scholarly endeavor. 
The University of Pennsylvania 
In 1749 Benjamin Franklin issued from his press 
in Philadelphia a little pamphlet entitled “Proposals 
Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsyl- 
vania.” This proved the centre of crystallization about 
which interest in such matters took form. There had 
already been maintained in Philadelphia for nine years 
a charity school for the education of poor children in the 
elementary branches; but as yet no dignified attempt 
at higher instruction. 
Franklin’s pamphlet aroused considerable interest, 
especially voicing the opinions of large numbers of the 
thrifty Quakers, since what it proposed was an academy 
where the study of English should be a prominent fea- 
ture, asserting that “the time spent in that study [Latin 
and Greek] might be much better employed in the edu- 
cation for such a country as ours.” As aresult, a board 
of twenty-four interested persons was selected, with’
-P-A-G-E-269
Colleges and Universities 251 
Franklin at their head, to organize a school. A consid- 
erable sum of money was raised by means of lotteries, 
private subscriptions, and appropriations from the com- 
mon council, and instruction began on January 7, 1751. 
/Yhe academy, as organized, was composed of three 
‘schools: the Latin, the English, and the mathematical ; 
but in spite of Franklin’s sentiments, educational con- 
servatism ruled the board of control, and all, save the 
former, were allowed to languish. In 1754 a charter 
was granted the school, and another in 1755, designating 
the institution as “the College, Academy, and Chari- 
table School of Philadelphia,” and carrying with it the 
customary privileges of granting degrees. The first 
commencement was held in 1757, with a graduating class 
of seven. In 1756 a course of study was arranged by 
the president, covering three years, and comprised read- 
ings in Juvenal, Livy, Cicero, Horace, Quintilian, and 
the Tusculan Questions; the Iliad, Thucydides, Epictetus, 
and Plato’s De Legibus formed the work in Greek. 
Mathematics occupied a prominent place in the course 
of study, and during the last two years considerable 
work was done in natural philosophy, chemistry, hydro- 
statics, prismatics, optics, and astronomy. Ethics and 
politics, natural and civil law, formed a group of sub- 
jects to which more than the usual attention was given. 
It is perhaps safe to say that no American college 
was, up to the time of the Revolution, offering courses 
more liberalizing in their influence than the College of 
Philadelphia. In 1765 it established a medical depart- 
ment, the first in the country. The Revolutionary 
period was one of sore trial to the institution. Work 
had to be suspended, its property depreciated, its funds 
were reduced, but more than all, the general assembly 
began to interfere with its affairs, and in 1779 took 
away its charter for various alleged infractions and. 
created a new corporation to be known as “The Trus- 
tees of the University of the State of Pennsylvania.” 
  P. 328. 
 
-P-A-G-E-270
  P. 317. 
P. 353. 252 Higher and Special Education 
The move was not a success. Public sentiment was 
with the old college, and in 1789 it was again reéstab- 
lished under its former president. There was, however, 
no field for two rival institutions and in 1791 the college 
and the university were united, creating the present 
corporation known as “ The Trustees of the University 
of Pennsylvania.” There can be no doubt that the 
legislative act of 1779 was a severe blow to the cause 
of higher education in Philadelphia; and it is doubtful 
whether the university has ever attained as high a rela- 
tive rank among the higher institutions of our country 
as the “college” held previous to it. 
In the new university there were, besides the Charita- 
ble School which was still maintained, three depart- 
ments, viz.: Arts, Law, and Medicine; the second, as 
well as the third, being the first of its kind in America. 
The department of Arts comprised five schools: Philos- 
ophy, Grammar, Mathematics, English, and German. 
In 1810 this plan of organization was abolished. For 
nearly three-quarters of the nineteenth century the uni- 
versity hardly kept pace with the times. In the college, 
the course of study was narrowly prescribed, differing 
but little, in fact, from that laid down in 1756 by Presi- 
dent Smith. In all that time, too, it had received only 
one comparatively small financial bequest. In 1866, 
however, the curriculum was broadened, elective courses 
introduced, and the whole course of study materially 
strengthened. Four years later the present site of the 
university was secured from the city, buildings erected, 
and an era of unprecedented prosperity begun. The 
Towne Scientific School was organized in 1874. 
The University of Pennsylvania is in no sense a state 
university, as are those established under the land grant 
of 1862. Although in the terms of the final charter the 
governor of the state must be ex officio a member of the 
board of trustees, and an annual statement of accounts 
should be laid before the legislature, Pennsylvania has
-P-A-G-E-271
  Colleges and Universities 253 
not been more generous in its support than many other 
states to private institutions within their borders. 
The entire state contributions, other than those equally 
shared by other colleges, consist of an appropriation in 
1872 of $100,000 contingent upon the raising of $250,000 
by private means, the whole to be used in the erection 
of a hospital, containing not less than 200 free beds; 
another $100,000 the next year on a similar basis 
($100,000 to be raised), and one in 1889 of $12,500 for 
a veterinary hospital with the provision that twelve 
scholarships to be filled by the governor be maintained. 
As at present organized, the university includes the fol- 
lowing departments: (1) The college, offering courses in 
the School of Arts and Science, in (a) arts and science, 
(4) finance and economy, (c) biology, (@) music; and, 
in the Towne Scientific School in (a) architecture, 
(6) science and technology, (¢) mechanical and electri- 
cal engineering, (2) civil engineering, (¢) chemistry, and 
(f) chemical engineering; (2) The Graduate School; 
(3) The Department of Law; (4) of Medicine; (5) of 
Veterinary Medicine ; (6) of Archeology ; (7) of Physical 
Education ; (8) of Dentistry ; (9) The University Hos-

ogy; (11) The Laboratory of Hygiene; (12) The Veteri- 
nary Hospital; (13) The University Library; (14) The 
Flower Astronomical Observatory. 
In 1904 there were about 2500 students enrolled under 
a faculty of 290. The library contained 225,000 volumes, 
Nearly 100 scholarships in the college are available, 
though many of them only to residents of Philadelphia, 
besides upward of 25 fellowships in the various graduate 
schools.

there be any of the higher classes in any college, or under private 
instruction that incline to come hither, they may expect Admission 
to proportionally higher Classes here.

as to Religion, there is no Intention to impose upon the Scholars, 
the peculiar Tenets of any particular Sect of Christians, but to incul-

and Morality, in which true Christians of each Denomination are 
generally agreed. And as to the daily Worship in the College, 
Morning and Evening, it is proposed that it ordinarily consist of 
such a Collection of Lessons, Prayers and Praises of the Liturgy

Such was the antenatal statement of our Columbia 
University, setting forth so well, not only the undefined 
hopes, but the formulated plans, that I have printed it 
in full. In the same issue of the Mercury is still an- 
other advertisement bearing upon the new educational 
project. It is headed “ Public Lottery,” and states that 
such will be held as “a further provision toward found- 
ing a college for the advancement of learning within 
the colony, to consist of 5000 tickets at 30 shillings each, 
832 of which are to be fortunate.” Later in the same 
year a charter incorporating “the governors of the 
College of the Province of New York in the city of New 
York in America,” and providing for the establishment 
of King’s College, was granted by George II, and the 
actual work of instruction begun in the vestry room of 
Trinity Church. During the following year a tract of 
land “in the skirts of the city,” though taxing the 
imagination of a modern New Yorker when he learns 
that it was bounded by Church, Barclay, and Murray 
streets, was granted the college. A little later a.build- 
ing 30 feet wide and 180 feet long ‘was erected, and 
occupied for more than a century. Of it Professor 
Matthews says : — 
“Here Alexander Hamilton and John Jay and Gouverneur Morris 
laid the foundation of their knowledge. Here the college was re- 
vived after the Revolution — King’s College no longer, but Columbia 
—the first use of the name of Columbus in connection with any of 
the institutions of the continent which he had discovered. Here was 
worthily continued the tradition of Hamilton and Jay. Here the 
new college graduated De Witt Clinton and Hamilton Fish, who 
saw the city— which had had only ten thousand inhabitants when 
the first class of freshmen met — grow steadily until its population 
had increased fifty-fold in the space of a century.” 
For the first year of the college’s existence the presi- 
dent was the sole member of the teaching force. With 
the entrance of the second class his son was appointed 
tutor; but for a number of years the faculty did not ex-

ceed three. The first commencement was held in 1758, 
at which time eight bachelor’s degrees were conferred 
and twelve master’s, upon graduates of other institu- 
tions. In 1767 a medical department was established. 
During the Revolutionary period the college building 
was converted into a hospital, the apparatus and books 
stored, the faculty dispersed, and work practically sus- 
pended, though it would seem that some instruction 
continued to be offered, as we find the record of two 
students who matriculated in 1777. 
Six months, however, after the British evacuated New 
York “an act for granting certain privileges to the 
college hitherto known as King’s College for altering 
the name and charter thereof, and erecting a University 
within the state” was passed by the legislature, and in 
1787 a new charter was granted, similar to the old one, 
but changing the name to Columbia College. The first 
trustees were all chosen from the board of regents of 
the State University; and though the institution was 
an independent corporation, the state made frequent 
appropriations for its support. In 1809 the require- 
ments for admission to the college were materially stiff- 
ened, and the course of study made to include in the 
freshman year, Cicero’s Letters to Atticus, Sallust en- 
tire, Horace’s Satires, Dalzel’s Collectanea Majora, 
Xenophon’s Memorabilia, Kent’s Lucian, double trans- 
lation Latin verse, Roman antiquities, Euclid’s Elements, 
geography, English grammar and reading, English 
composition and declamation. 
The sophomore class read Virgil’s Georgics, Livy, the 
Odes and Epistles of Horace, Demosthenes, Homer, and 
Herodotus. They continued double translation and 
Latin composition in prose and verse, also Roman an- 
tiquities. In mathematics they took up plane trigonom- 
etry and its application, and algebra. They studied 
geography, elements of rhetoric, English composition, 
and declama.tion in English and Latin.

  258 Lligher and Special Education 
In the junior class were read Cicero on Oratory, 
Terence, Quintilian, Longinus, and Sophocles. The 
class also reviewed Horace, Greek and Latin antiquities, 
and took up Greek composition. English composition 
was continued with criticism, and the student was re- 
quired to declaim pieces of his own composition. His- 
tory and chronology were added to geography and 
mathematics. Spherical trigonometry and conic sections 
were taken up. The important studies of this year 
were natural philosophy and elements of ethics. 
In the senior year, to a continuation and review of the 
subjects formerly pursued, were added astronomy, fluc- 
tuation, analysis of intellectual powers, principles of 
reasoning, and the law of realms and nations. This 
course remained in practice until 1836, when it was 
much broadened, and a scientific and literary course 
added. 
In 1857 the college had outgrown its site and moved 
to the corner of Madison Avenue and 49th Street—~a 
location which at the time was as truly “in the skirts of 
the city”’ as the old one had been a century and more 
before. There it remained for forty years, until it re- 
moved to its present magnificent and probably perma- 
nent home on Morningside Heights, between 114th and 
120th streets. In addition to the medical school, organ- 
ized in 1767, made independent in 1814 as the College 
of Physicians and Surgeons, reannexed in 1860, and 
fully reincorporated as a department of medicine in 
1891, are several other professional departments, some 
of which outnumber in point of students the college 
itself. 
In 1858 the Law School was fully organized, though 
as far back as 1798 a professorship of law had been 
established, with James Kent as its incumbent; and it 
was to Columbia students that his commentaries on 
American law were first delivered as lectures. 
In 1864 the School of Mines was established, and in 
1880 that of Political Science.
-P-A-G-E-277
Colleges and Universities 259 
The latest’ addition along professional lines was the 
final incorporation of the Teachers’ College, indepen- 
  P. 380. 
dently organized in 1888, though under a loose affiliation » 
with Columbia, as a professional school for teachers till 
1898. The School of Journalism, already announced, 
though not yet organized, will probably be the next. 
In 1889 Barnard College, for women, was affiliated 
with Columbia very much as Radcliffe College is with 
Harvard. In 1900 it was, however, incorporated as an 
undergraduate department for women, instruction being 
in separate classes, for the most part for undergraduates, 
though both sexes work together in the graduate school. 
The latter, which is, strictly speaking, the university, is 
a very important feature of the Columbia organization, 
having, in 1902, 609 students registered as candidates 
for higher degrees. In 1904 the total registration in all 
the schools and colleges of Columbia was 4512, under 
a teaching force of 576. The library contained 346,354 
volumes. The institution had graduated 16,490 students 
in the course of its history, and possessed productive 
funds amounting to $15,026,756. 
More than seventy scholarships, for the most part 
equal to the tuition, are open under various restrictions 
to the undergraduates of Columbia, and five to those of 
Barnard College. A considerable amount of money, 
too, is available for various prizes. In addition to these 
are upwards of twenty-five fellowships open to graduate 
students, each of a net value of $500. 7 
Brown University 
Brown University, at Providence, Rhode Island, was 
the sixth higher institution of learning to be founded 
during colonial times. It was established by the 
Baptists. In 1762 the Philadelphia Baptist Association, 
taking cognizance of the difficulties of students of their 
faith in most of the American colleges, entertained the 
ey P. 44.
-P-A-G-E-278
  260 Higher and Special Education 
proposal of Rev. Morgan Edwards, a Philadelphia 
clergyman, to found, in the colony of Rhode Island, the 
land of religious freedom, a college to be under the 
control of their own denomination. James Manning, a 
graduate of Princeton of the same year, was appointed 
by the association as its agent to establish “a seminary 
of polite literature, subject to the government of the 
Baptists.” 
In 1764 the friends of the movement obtained from 
the general assembly a charter for the “College or Uni- 
versity in the English colony of Rhode Island in Provi- 
dence Plantation in New England in America. The 
trustees and fellows at any time hereafter, giving such 
more particular name to the college in honor of the 
greatest and most distinguished benefactor, or otherwise 
as they see fit.” 
The charter stated that the corporation should consist 
of two branches, viz. trustees and fellows, of whom 
there should be thirty-six in the former and twelve in 
the latter body. Denominational qualifications were 
also prescribed; and though the president must always 
be a Baptist, the three important positions of chancel- 
lor, secretary, and treasurer are without religious limita- 
tions. The corporation is self-perpetuating, but since 
1874 has been filled from nominations made by the 
alumni. The religious attitude of the university is 
clearly shown by the following clause in the charter : — 
“Furthermore it is hereby enacted and declared: That into the 
liberal and Catholic institution shall never be admitted any religious 
tests. But on the contrary all members hereof shall forever enjoy 
full, free, absolute, and uninterrupted liberty of conscience.” 
The college at its start, being without funds and un- 
able to support the president, Dr. Manning accepted 
the pastorate of the Baptist Church at Warren, mean- 
while opening a Latin school, which was later moved to 
Providence, and flourished for more than a century and
-P-A-G-E-279

  a quarter. In 1765 instruction of a higher grade was 
begun, and four years later the first class of seven mem- 
bers was graduated. A tutor was appointed at the be- 
ginning of the collegiate work, and no other addition to 
the faculty until 1774. 
Warren had not been looked upon as a permanent seat 
of the college, and the necessity which had arisen of 
erecting a college building gave rise to a controversy 
between various towns of the state for its possession. 
Final settlement was made in 1770 through its removal 
to Providence and the erection of University Hall, 
modelled after Nassau at Princeton, which still remains 
one of the principal centres of student activity. 
In 1776 the work of the college was interrupted by 
the Revolutionary War, and was not resumed until 1782, 
University Hall meanwhile being used as a barrack and 
hospital for the colonial American and French troops. 
In 1791, after twenty-nine years of service, President 
Manning died. At this time-the faculty consisted of 
the president, four professors, and two tutors. The first 
college funds, amounting to $4500, were collected in Eng- 
land and Ireland by Rev. Morgan Edwards in 1767— 
1768. During the next two years subscriptions to the 
amount of $2500 were raised in the South. The former 
contribution was made a permanent fund; the latter de- 
voted to the construction of buildings. Further gifts 
were received from the Philadelphia, the Charleston, 
and the Warren Baptist associations, but they appear 
to have ceased with the outburst of the Revolutionary 
War. 
President Manning was succeeded in office by Rev. 
Jonathan Maxey, who resigned in 1802 to accept the 
presidency of Union College, and was followed by Rev. 
Asa Messer, Professor of Mathematics and Natural 
Philosophy in the college, who served for twenty-four 
years. During his administration a medical school was 
established and maintained for seventeen years (1811-
-P-A-G-E-280
Brown, 262 fligher and Special Education 
1828), but was then discontinued. In 1804 the corpora- 
tion availed themselves of their chartered rights to give 
the college some more definite name, by formally calling 
it “Brown University” after Nicholas Brown, an alum- 
nus, and the first of a distinguished line of benefactors. 
Francis Wayland, the fourth president, entered upon 
his official duties in 1827. He at once raised the stand- 
ard of scholarship, and gradually increased the scope of 
the instruction. He finally accomplished an entire re- 
organization of the university on the basis of the elective 
principle. In accordance with this “ New system” the 
bachelor’s degree was given for a three years’ course, 
and the master’s degree was given for a four years’ 
course. Graduate study and special study were both 
encouraged; and the sciences, in accordance with the 
spirit of the charter, were made prominent in the cur- 
riculum. This system was not put into operation until 
1850, and was not fully in force until President Wayland’s 
retirement, five years later. At the close of his ad- 
ministration in 1855, the university had twenty depart- 
ments of instruction which, with the years of their 
establishment, were as follows: — 
Professor of languages and other branches of learn- 
ing, 1765; natural philosophy, 1769; law, 1790 (never 
taught); natural history, 1784; mathematics and astron- 
omy, 1786; materia medica and botany, 1811; anatomy 
and surgery, 1811; chemistry, 1811; theory and prac- 
tice of medicine, 1815 (last four discontinued); moral 
philosophy and metaphysics, 1811; oratory and belles- 
lettres, 1815; Latin, Greek, 1825. Progress during Presi- 
dent Wayland’s administration is clearly shown by the 
following list of subjects, to which professors or instruc- 
tors were assigned at the dates annexed: chemistry, 
physiology, and geology, 1834; moral and intellectual 
philosophy, 1834; belles-lettres, 1835; rhetoric, 1837; 
Hebrew literature, 1838; modern languages and litera- 
ture, 1843; Greek, 1843; Latin, 1844; French, 1844;

history and political economy, 1850; natural philosophy 
and civil engineering, 1850; chemistry applied to the 
arts, 1850; rhetoric and English literature, 1851 ; didac- 
tics (z.e. pedagogy), 1851; analytical chemistry, 1854. 
Since 1855, five men, Revs. Barnas Sears (1855-1867), 
Alexis Casswell (1867-1871), Ezekiel Gilman Robinson 
(1871-1889), Elisha Benjamin Andrews (1889-1899), 
and William Herbert Perry Faunce (1899- ) (pres- 
ent occupant), have successively occupied the presi- 
dent’s chair, and under their direction the university 
has shown a steady, and in some cases, a rapid growth. 
More than twenty buildings have been erected upon 
the campus, or are in process of construction, some of 
which are among the finest types of American college 
architecture. 
In 1904 the student enrolment was 854, the teach- 
ing force 79; volumes in the library 130,000. Six 
thousand students have been graduated, of whom 2940 
are living. About 100 scholarships are open to under- 
graduates, varying in value from $60 to three or four 
times that amount, and two fellowships in the graduate 
departments, each of the income from $10,000. 
There are also special aid and loan funds available 
for students needing temporary financial support.   
Rutgers College 
The charter under which Queen’s College, now Rut- 
gers, at New Brunswick, New Jersey, was founded and 
is still maintained, was granted in 1766, to the Dutch 
Reformed Church. A previous charter had been 
granted, but not used, owing, it is said, to a stated re- 
quirement within it that the Dutch language be exclu- 
sively used in the college. Whether this was so or not 
is not certain, but in the second charter is the article : — 
“Provided also, that all minutes of the meetings . . . and all 
regulations relating to the government of the said college, and all
-P-A-G-E-282
P. 309. 264 fligher and Special Education 
accounts relating to the receipts and payments of money shall be 
made in the English language and no other.” 
  The first meeting of the trustees under the amended 
charter was held in Hackensack, in 1771, and a spirited 
contest between that town and New Brunswick carried 
on for the location of the college, which was finally won 
by the latter. There seems to have been no president 
appointed until 1786, though Frederick Frelinghuysen, 
son of General Frelinghuysen of Revolutionary fame, 
had been for some years acting as tutor. 
During the troublous times from 1776 to 1783 the 
college made frequent moves from scenes of active hos- 
tility, and for a while carried on its work on the Raritan, 
as is shown by this item, appearing in the Mew Jersey 
Gazette for January 4, 1779. 
“The faculty of Queen’s college take this method to inform the 
public that the business of said college is still carried on at the 
north Branch of Raritan in the county of Somerset, where good 
accomodations for young gentlemen may be had in respectable 
families at as moderate prices as in any part of the state. This 
neighborhood is so far distant from headquarters that not any of 
the troops are stationed here, neither does the army in an way inter- 
fere with the business of the college. The faculty also take the 
liberty to remind the public that the representatives of the state 
have enacted a law by which students at college are exempted from 
military duty.” 
The faculty, so far as we are able to discover, con- 
sisted of John Taylor, who succeeded Frelinghuysen 
and continued to hold the important office until 1795, 
when he became a professor at Union College. In that 
year the college was closed, and remained so until 1807. 
Since that time it has had a continued existence of use- 
fulness, though it has never figured among the larger 
institutions of learning, so far as number of students is 
concerned. Although originally intended as a fitting 
school for the ministry of the Dutch Reformed Church, 
an independent divinity school was established by the

denomination, and the courses have always been those 
usually found at the smaller academic institutions. By 
its charter its president and two-thirds of its trustees 
must be members of that church, though no religious 
test is required of the students. 
In 1904, 226 students were enrolled under a faculty 
of 28. It had graduated 2126 students, of whom 1236 
were still living. 
Dartmouth College 
Dartmouth College, the latest of the colonial insti- 
tutions of higher learning to be established, was the 
outgrowth of an educational attempt to Christianize 
the Indians, made by Rev. Eleazer Wheelock at his 
home in Lebanon, Connecticut, in the year 1754. Begin- 
ning with two Indian boys, in ten years the number of 
pupils had increased to thirty, a considerable number 
of whom were sons of the white colonists. | The school 
attracted considerable attention, and received financial 
aid both from the assemblies of Massachusetts and New 
Hampshire, while that of Connecticut recommended 
contributions from the congregations throughout the 
colony. In honor of Joshua Moor, a farmer of Mans- 
field, who made a donation of a house and two acres of 
land, the institution was called Moor’s Indian Charity 
School, which it-in-fact-still-remaitis*on-paper, the presi- 
dent and trustees.of Dartmouth College holding similar 
titles in the ‘school, though no actual instruction has been 
given by the latter since 1849. 
In 1763 Wheelock, believing that his school, in order 
to fulfil best its primary function of educating the 
Indian, should follow the frontier, cast about for a 
favorable location in closer touch with Indian settle- 
ments. ~ He wrote first to Governor Amherst of Virginia, 
but receiving no reply, made it known that he was willing 
to receive offers of land and money from any favorably

situated community. These came from all along the 
New England frontier: Hebron,-Connecticut;. Pittsfield 
and Stockbridge, Massachusetts; Chester, Vermont; 
Harrisburg, New York; and several New Hampshire 
towns ;each_offered inducements of land and money. 
Finally the town of Hanover, New Hampshire, was 
fixed upon by Wheelock fer-reasons-as-fellows : — 
“Tt is most central on the river [Connecticut], and most conven- 
ient for transportation up and down the river: has convenient com- 
munication with Crown Point and Lake Champlain, being less than 
60 miles to the former and 140 to the latter, and water-carriage to 
each, excepting about 30 miles (as they say) and will be upon the 
road which must soon be opened from Portsmouth and Crown Point 
and within a mile of the only convenient place for a bridge across 
said river. The situation is on a beautiful plain: the soil fertile and 
easy of cultivation. The tract on which the college is fixed, lying 
mostly in one body and convenient for improvement in the towns of 
Hanover and Lebanon (N.H.).” 
He also adds : — 
“There are in this vicinity, in this part of the country which is 
  _ how settling, more than 200 towns already chartered, settled, or 
settling, which do, or soon will want goodly ministers.” 
Dr. Wheelock, just previous to the selection of a site, 
had procured from George III a charter, a masterpiece 
of its kind, allowing him to dignify his institution with 
the title “College,” and as a recognition of the aid which 
Lord Dartmouth had given in the raising of funds in 
England, it was named after him. In 1770 work was 
begun upon the new site, an area of six acres cleared of 
timber and log structures erected. 
The hardships and disappointment connected with 
these first years in the wilderness were so great that 
nothing but the indomitable perseverance of Wheelock 
would have brought success}, yet before his death in 
1779 he had the gratification™~of seeing seventy-two 
students graduate and take prominent part in colonial 
affairs. The War of the Revolution had dispersed his
-P-A-G-E-285
Colleges and Universities 267 
Indian students, and such have only been represented 
since by an occasional straggler. 
We have no exact statement of the course of study 
for the earliest years of the college, but it seemingly 
differed but slightly from those of Harvard and Yale, 
since there were occasional interchanges of students. 
During Dr. Wheelock’s administration there were, upon 
the faculty, besides himself, two tutors. At his death 
his son, Dr. John Wheelock, was appointed to the presi- 
dency, which he held for thirty-six years. In 1796 
candidates for the freshman class ‘‘ must be versed in 
Virgil, Cicero’s Select Orations, the Greek Testament, 
be able accurately to translate English into Latin, and 
also understand the fundamental rules of Arithmetic.” 
The course of-study for the same year was also stated 
as.follows :— 
“The freshman class study the Latin and Greek classics, arithme- 
tic, English grammar and rhetoric. The sophomore class study the 
Latin and Greek classics, logic, geography, arithmetic, geometry, 
trigonometry, algebra, conic sections, surveying, belles-lettres and 
criticism. The junior class studies the Greek and Latin classics, 
geometry, natural and moral philosophy, and astronomy. The 
senior class reads metaphysics, theology, and natural and political 
law. The study of the Hebrew and other oriental languages as also 
the French language is recommended to the student.” 
Declamations, orations, and other compositions were 
regularly required, and it was further stated “that 
the President attends morning and evening prayers with 
the students in the chapel, and often delivers lectures 
to them on ecclesiastical history, or the doctrines of the 
Christian religion and other important subjects.” The 
college had a hard struggle for existence. Soon after 
the death of its founder, the treasurer’s report showed 
that if all the property of the corporation were sold at 
auction, not enough money would be raised to pay its 
debts. Moneys were, however, raised by subscription, 
both in this country and abroad, and the lands granted

  the college becoming more productive, it managed to 
survive. The great crisis came in 1815, when the legisla- 
ture of New Hampshire practically discontinued the 
college, establishing in its place a university with a 
different president and board of trustees. This action 
was bitterly fought in the courts, by friends of the 
college, led by Daniel Webster, a graduate ; And, after 
an adverse decision by the supreme court of the state, 
was taken to the United States Supreme’ Court, where 
the decision was reversed, and the college given all its 
original rights. It was in connection with this litiga- 
tion that Webster first came into prominence. 
Since that time the development of the college has 
been similar to that of other New England institutions 
of its class. For the long period from 1828 to 1863 it 
was presided over by Rev. Nathan Lord, a man of great 
administrative force, and under his leadership made 
substantial progress. 
As far back as 1798, a medical school was established 
which always held a high place. In 1851 the Chandler 
School of Science and Arts was founded for the estab- 
lishment and support of a permanent department or 
school of instruction in the college, in the practical and 
useful arts. A school of civil engineering has been 
maintained since 1867 and one in administration and 
finance since 1900. 
In 1904 there were 867 students in the entire college, 
and an instructional force of 72. The library contained 
100,000 volumes. Its productive funds amount to 
$2,500,000. 
More than 250 scholarships, varying in value from 
£50 to $150 are open to undergraduates, and six scholar- 
ships ($300), and one fellowship ($500), to graduate 
students.

6. LatTER COLLEGES 
In light of the problems which confronted the new 
republic during and immediately following the struggle 
for independence, a surprising interest is manifested in 
higher education at that time, no less than thirteen col- 
leges having been established in the quarter of a century 
between 1776 and 1800. Although we have no exact 
records, it is probable that at the end of this period not 
more than one hundred professors and instructors were 
connected with the whole group of colleges then estab- 
lished, while but from one thousand to two thousand stu- 
dents were in atténdance, and it is doubtful if the total 
property was worth $1,000,000. No one of these institu- 
tions admitted women in any way to its privileges. 
At the beginning of the twentieth century (1902) there 
are no less than 464 colleges and universities for men 
or for both sexes, 134 of which admit men only to their 
undergraduate work, while 330 admit both men and 
women on equal terms. These institutions have 13,952 
men and 1994 women on their faculties, 62,430 men 
and 21,051 women as undergraduates, and 3089 men 
. and 1306 women as resident graduate students. The 
total property in buildings, grounds, apparatus, etc., 
amounts to $171,798,822, with productive funds, in addi- 
tion amounting to $164,298,786. In addition to these 
institutions for men and both sexes are 131 higher 
institutions of learning for women alone, with a teach- 
ing force of 662 men and 1741 women, 16,964 students, 
property to the amount of $17,965,152, and productive 
funds of $7,191,099. These figures mean that in a 
single century, while the population of the country has 
increased about 6 times, the number of higher institu- 
tions of learning has increased 20 times, the number 
of instructors 170 times, the number of students at a con- 
servative estimate of 47 times, and the property and 
productive funds 200 times. Certainly a growth for any

country to be proud of, and one never before approxi- 
mated at any period of the world’s history. 
It is true that educational advancement cannot be 
measured solely in numbers of institutions; but except 
for some few limited regions, the growth in numbers of 
higher institutions of learning seems not to have ex- 
ceeded the legitimate demands, and on the whole has 
been a healthy one, and has extended pretty fully to all 
parts of our country. The establishment of colleges for 
men and for both sexes, within the several geographical 
divisions, made use of by the United States Commis- 
sioner of Education in the statistical tables given in his 
annual reports, is as follows, for each decade of the 
nineteenth century : —

This table is for colleges and universities for men 
and those for both sexes, not including higher institu- 
tions for women only. 
Of the five hundred: and more institutions of higher 
learning which have sprung up in our country since 
the beginning of its independence, but comparatively 
few have. gained more than a local importance in our 
educational history ; possibly thirty or forty, besides the 
colleges for women, which are treated in another chapter, 
and the land grant colleges in a later paragraph in this. 
This statement does not mean that the others are not 
doing valuable work, nor that the small colleges are not 
an important factor in our educational mechanism, but 
that their influence is not sufficiently national to war- 
rant individual notice, in a brief survey of American 
education. 
Some few do, however, seem to demand such notice, 
and I make it, fully recognizing the fact that errors in 
evaluation are likely to occur. Statistics are not given, 
but may be secured from the annual catalogues, which 
are easily procurable, or from the World’s Almanac. 
Among those dating their establishment from the

  272 Higher and Special Education 
latter part of the eighteenth century, after the Revolu- 
tion, may well be mentioned Williams, Bowdoin, Union, 
and Middlebury colleges. 
The first of these originated as a free school in Will- 
iamstown, Massachusetts, in 1785, though not chartered 
as Williams College until 1793. When this was done, 
Harvard entered a formal protest, urging that there was 
no demand for a second college in the state, and that 
the cause of education would be injured by the estab- 
lishment of one. Williams has a beautiful campus, 
many venerable buildings, and does work of a high 
standard. Women are not admitted. No professional 
schools are maintained. The income from nearly 
$260,000 is devoted to students’ aid through scholar- 
ships, fellowships, and prizes. 
Bowdoin College was founded in 1794, at Brunswick, 
Maine. It has not only had upon its faculty some of 
the foremost scientific and literary men of the century 
and more of its history, but has graduated an unusual 
number of men of the very highest rank, among them 
both Longfellow and Hawthorne. A medical school was 
established in 1820 (?) and is still maintained. Women 
are not admitted to any of the departments of the col- 
lege. The income of more than $125,000 is devoted 
to scholarships and prizes. 
Union College, at Schenectady, New York, was 
founded in 1795. It was to have been called Clinton 
College, in honor of New York’s great governor. Union 
was one of the first colleges, if not the first, to break 
away from the old classical course, and place scientific 
instruction on a plane of equal dignity with it. Certain 
electives were offered as early as 1797. It maintains, 
under the regular college course,|a school of civil engi- 
neering. Women are not admifted to the institution. 
A large number of scholarships dre open under various 
conditions. 
Middlebury College, at Middlebury, Vermont, was  
-P-A-G-E-293
  
Colleges and Universities 273 
founded in 1800, through the personal influence of Presi- 
dent Dwight of Yale. It has always held an honorable 
place among the smaller New England colleges, and has 
graduated many eminent men. No professional schools 
are maintained. Women are admitted. Some forty 
scholarships are offered. 
Hamilton College, at Clinton, New York, is the out- 
growth of Hamilton-Oneida Academy, established as an 
Indian school early in the last decade of the eighteenth 
century. Its charter as a college was granted in 1812. 
It has a campus of forty-two acres, many admirable 
buildings, and has always maintained a high standing. 
Hamilton offers fifty-five permanent scholarships. 
Colby College, at Waterville, Maine, was founded as 
the Maine Literary and Theological Institution in 1815, 
and has been successively rechristened Waterville Col- 
lege in 1821, Colby University in 1867, and Colby Col- 
lege in 1900. It is a Baptist institution, offering only 
academic courses of instruction. Women are admitted 
upon a codérdinate, though not strictly a coeducational, 
basis. Upwards of seventy undergraduate scholarships 
are maintained. 
Amherst College, at Amherst, Massachusetts, was 
founded in 1821. For nearly fifty years a portion of 
the board of trustees was filled by the Massachusetts 
legislature. It offers no professional courses, and is 
open only to men. The income from more than 
#285,000 is devoted to student aid in one form or an- 
other. The Kellogg fellowship is perhaps the most valu- 
able open to any American college graduate. 
Columbian University was founded at Washington, 
District of Columbia, in 1821. Its buildings are in the 
heart of the city, in close proximity to many of the 
national bureaus and departmental libraries. Under 
the university organization are the college, the Corcoran 
Scientific School, the School of Graduate Studies, the 
Law School, the School of Jurisprudence and Diplomacy,

the Medical and the Dental School. About fifteen

Western Reserve University, at Cleveland, Ohio, was 
established as Western Reserve College, at Hudson, in 
the same state, in 1826, where it remained until 1880. 
The academic undergraduate department is known as 
Adelbert College. Besides this college, which is for 
men, are the Women’s College, the Medical and Law 
colleges and a dental school. Many scholarships and 
other financial helps to the students are available. 
Lafayette College, at Easton, Pennsylvania, was 
founded in 1826, shortly after the last visit of the illus- 
trious Frenchman of that name to this country, and 
named in honor of him. Besides its literary courses, it 
maintains a scientific department of much strength, but 
no professional schools. It does not admit women. A 
considerable number of prizes are offered annually. 
New York University, which must not be confounded 
with the University of the State of New York, was or- 
ganized in 1851. Until recent years it was known as the 
University of the City of New York, and occupied 
buildings in Washington Square. In 1894 all save its 
professional departments was removed to a magnificent 
site upon University Heights, Fordham, facing the 
Harlem River. It has many imposing buildings, in 
connection with one of which, the library, is the so- 
called Hall of Fame. Besides the college, are schools 
of Applied Science, Law, Medicine) and Pedagogy. 
Women are admitted to some of the courses. About 
thirty scholarships and three fellowships are open. 
Oberlin College, Oberlin, Ohio, was established in 
1833, through Methodist influence, though formally 
known as Oberlin Collegiate Institute until 1850. A 
theological seminary and a conservatory of music are 
maintained. Oberlin has from the start been fully co- 
educational, being the pioneer in this respect. Fifty or 
more scholarships are offered.

Colleges and Universities 275 
Tulane University, of Louisiana, is the name under 
which the old University of Louisiana at New Orleans 
has been known since 1834, when the first of the Tulane 
bequests, amounting to more than $1,000,000 was re- 
ceived. It has a fine equipment, and is one of the lead- 
ing institutions of the South. Its departments include 
the college, the Graduate School, the Women’s College, 
and the colleges of Law and Medicine. More than 150 
scholarships are available. 
Marietta College, chartered in 1835, was the outgrowth 
of educational beginnings at Marietta, Ohio, as early as 
1797. It was one of the pioneer institutions west of the 
Alleghanies. No professional courses are offered, and 
both sexes are admitted. About forty scholarships are 
open under various conditions. 
Rochester University, at Rochester, New York, was 
founded in 1851, as a result of schism in the faculty and 
student body of the Hamilton Literary and Theological 
Institution. It is under the control of the Baptist de- 
nomination. More than one hundred scholarships are 
offered. 
The College of the City of New York is, as might be 
inferred, a part of the school system of New York City, 
and is entirely supported by municipal taxation. It 
dates as a college from 1854, though the Free Academy, 
of which it is the outgrowth, was established seven years 
earlier. It is. intended only for residents of the city. 
Its entrance requirements are not so rigid as are those 
of most American colleges, and its students less mature, 
though the same academic degrees are given. Women 
are not admitted. The college will occupy, probably 
about 1905, a magnificent site upon Washington Heights. 
Since tuition is free, there are no scholarships, though a 
considerable number of prizes are offered. 
Northwestern University, at Evanston, Illinois, was 
established by the Methodists, in 1855, and has become 
one of the strong institutions of the Middle West. It

  maintains, besides the regular college courses, schools 
of Medicine, Law, Pharmacy, Dentistry, and Music, a 
number of the schools being in Chicago. The Garrett 
Biblical Institute is also in close affiliation with the 
college at Evanston. A free scholarship for the fresh- 
man year is granted each high school of Illinois upon 
the university accredited lists. Six fellowships are open 
to graduate students. 
Tufts College, in the town of Medford, Massachusetts, 
was founded in 1852, through Universalist interests. 
P. T. Barnum was a benefactor of the college, having 
given a building for a museum, and much of its con- 
tents. Beside the literary and scientific courses, there 
are schools of Medicine, Dentistry, and Divinity. The 
latter are open to women. About seventy scholarships 
and one fellowship are available. 
The University of Denver, at Denver, Colorado, is 
the outgrowth of Colorado Seminary, a Methodist insti- 
tution founded in 1864, taking its present name in 1880. 
It has an extensive campus in the suburbs of Denver, 
with many fine buildings, including an observatory with 
a telescope of twenty-inch aperture. Besides the Col- 
lege of Liberal Arts, are maintained schools of Medi- 
cine, Law, Theology, Fine Arts, and Dentistry. It is 
coeducational throughout. Several prizes are open to 
student competition. 
Lehigh University, at South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, 
founded in 1865, is especially strong in its scientific 
equipment. It maintains a school of technology. Women 
are not admitted to the university. Several prizes of 
money value are open to student competition. 
Cornell University, at Ithaca, New York, one of our 
country’s greatest and most progressive higher institu- 
tions of learning, was founded under the land grant of 
1862. One-tenth of the entire grant, equal to fifteen hun- 
dred square miles, fell to New York State,—the most 
magnificent educational endowment ever bestowed by a
-P-A-G-E-297
  Colleges and Universities 277 
nation to a single institution. After an unsuccessful 
attempt to found with it, what was to be known as the 
People’s College, all the conflicting interests were united 
under Ezra Cornell’s influence, and the present institu- 
tion was founded in 1868. Mr. Cornell gave the campus 
of two hundred acres, than which there is no other in the 
country of more natural beauty, made many other be- 
quests to the institution, and proved a most efficient 
guardian of its financial interests. Its entire history is 
typical of American thrift and foresight. Besides the 
academic departments, both graduate and undergradu- 
ate, there are colleges of Civil Engineering, Mechanical 
Engineering, Agriculture, and Medicine, the latter in 
New York City. The State College of Forestry and 
veterinary colleges are also organically connected with 
Cornell. One undergraduate scholarship is maintained 
for each assembly district in the state, in addition to 
which are some forty or more valuable prizes. Twenty- 
four fellowships and sixteen graduate scholarships are 
also offered. 
Syracuse University, founded at Syracuse, New York, 
in 1871, is the successor of Genesee College, which had 
for twenty years been in operation at Lima, New York. 
It is a Methodist institution. It maintains colleges of 
Liberal Arts, Fine Arts, Applied Science, Law, and 
Medicine. Women are admitted. 
The University of Cincinnati, at Cincinnati, Ohio, was 
founded in 1873. Itis, ina sense, a municipal institution, 
since the city appoints a part of its board of trustees; 
but it is largely maintained by private benefactions. 
Academic, engineering, medical, law, dental, and techni- 
cal departments are maintained by the university, or are 
closely affiliated. Twenty-two scholarships and a limited 
number of fellowships are open. 
Colorado College was established at Colorado Springs, 
Colorado, in 1874, and is nominally under Congregational 
supervision. It occupies an enviable position among Pp. 349, 363.

equipment and number of students. It is coeducational. 
No professional schools are maintained. Some twenty 
scholarships are available. 
Johns Hopkins University, established in Baltimore, 
Maryland, in 1876, is one of the very first institutions in 
our country to-day, in which work for advanced degrees 
is a more prominent feature than are the undergraduate 
courses. Such, however, have been the conditions there 
since its inception. A college is maintained, but it is 
the graduate school that has given Johns Hopkins a 
reputation for scholarly work unsurpassed by any other 
institution in the country. Besides the literary and 
scientific schools of the university there is a medical 
department. The latter is coeducational, though the 
others are not. Fifteen graduate scholarships and twenty 
fellowships are offered by the university. 
Leland Stanford Junior University at Palo Alto, 
California, was founded, and has since been maintained, 
through benefactions from the Stanford wealth, largely 
coming as direct gifts from Mrs. Stanford. 
In all, several millions has been so turned over. 
From the start it has been coeducational, though not 
more than five hundred women may be registered as 
students at any one time. The university has a beauti- 
ful campus, an extensive equipment, and has, for so 
young an institution, come rapidly to the front rank 
of American universities. A department of law is 
maintained as the only professional school. But one 
scholarship is offered. 
The University of Chicago, established by John D. 
Rockefeller in 1892, is perhaps the most striking ex- 
ample the world has seen of what almost unlimited funds, 
intelligently expended, can do in a brief time for a higher 
institution of learning. During the twelve years of its 
history, it has lived through or jumped over the stages 
which it took our old Eastern colleges centuries to pass
-P-A-G-E-299
Colleges and Universities 279 
through; and is, so far as material development and 
elaborateness of organization is concerned, hardly sur- 
passed by any. The university was coeducational for 
the first ten years; but in 1902 instituted the plan of 
segregation of the sexes. Its sessions are practically 
continuous throughout the year, the summer work 
constituting one “quarter.” Besides the undergraduate 
courses, and the Graduate School with a very large 
enrolment, are schools of Divinity, Medicine, Law, and 
Education; university extension, too, is conducted on a 
broad scale, and a large number of colleges in all parts 
of the country are in “affiliated relation” with the 
university, making possible an interchange of students 
and certain other privileges. A large number of scholar- 
ships are offered to secondary schools in accredited 
relations to the university, and above seventy fellowships 
in the Graduate School, ranging in value from $120 to 
: $820. 
The State Universities 
Although the colleges of colonial days were all 
private corporations, in nearly every instance they had 
received moneys or lands by public bequest from the 
colonies in which they were situated. Harvard was 
established by an act of the general court of Massa- 
chusetts.. At William and Mary the charter conferred a 
land endowment and a portion of the public revenues. 
The colonial legislature of Connecticut not only made 
grants of land to Yale College, but for many years in the 
early eighteenth century made annual appropriations of 
money. Princeton was first known as the College of 
New Jersey, and was at least indirectly aided by the 
legislature through its authorization of a lottery in 1762. 
The present University of Pennsylvania during its infancy 
received public money from the city of Philadelphia, the 
king, and the proprietors of the colony. Columbia, 
when the College of the Province of New York, was P. 443.

the recipient of excise moneys. Brown University was 
granted certain exemptions from taxation. At Rutgers, 
the governor was ex officio president of the board of 
trustees, and Dartmouth was most generously accorded 
by the legislature of New Hampshire, large tracts of 
land, and on one occasion 4500 for the erection of a 
new building. This investment of public funds in col- 
leges was understood by many to carry with it some 
sort of state control, but since the institutions were all 
more or less under denominational supervision, such was 
impossible, and a widespread distrust of them as they were 
conducted arose. This took many forms, and was shared 
by men of the most diverse religious and _ political 
opinions. But it all came virtually to this: That no one 
of the colleges fully answered the public needs as regards 
higher education. Every one of them was the college 
of a faction or a sect within the commonwealth, and failed 
therefore to be the college of the commonwealth in its 
entirety. The democratic spirit which had been rising, 
very slowly, since the beginning of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, and the interest in civic affairs, which increased 
very rapidly as the Revolution drew on, both tended to 
accentuate this feeling of distrust. It was much more 
pronounced in the case of some colleges than of others 
but none of them seems to have escaped it entirely. 
As a result, the legislatures in most of the colonies 
tried to gain fuller control of the colleges, and make 
them more nearly conform to the popular will; in a 
sense, to make state universities of them. With at 
least three— Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, 
and Dartmouth — this was actually done, and each had 
its brief term of service as a real state institution. 
With most of the others the controversy was hard 
fought, but they were too firmly established on other 
lines to be moved, and retained their original individu- 
ality. But the controversy was not without its effect, 
for the Southern states, and those across the Alleghany
-P-A-G-E-301
  Colleges and Universities 281 
Mountains, which were at the point of framing state 
constitutions, were warned by the difficulties which 
their older sisters had experienced, and almost without 
exception made provision for one or more higher insti- 
tutions of learning under direct state control. In this 
movement North Carolina took the lead, inserting in 
the constitution which was framed in 1776 the clause 
“ All useful learning shall be encouraged and promoted 
in one or more universities;” and although an institu- 
tion founded upon this clause was opened in 1795, it did 
not come under full state control until 1821. 
In South Carolina a university was under such con- 
trol in 1801. 
As the vast territory of the Middle West was opened 
up, and constitution after constitution framed, the same 
wise provision for carrying the public education of the 
youth to the highest step was made. And it is here 
that the State University has reached its fullest develop- 
ment. The original interest of all is expressed in the 
passage from the Indiana constitution written in 1819: — 
“Tt shall be the duty of the General Assembly, as soon as circum- 
stances will permit, to provide by law for a general system of educa- 
tion ascending in regular gradation from township schools to State 
University, wherein tuition shall be gratis, and equally open to all.” 
This is the charter of the American State University — 
the crown of the public school system. 
“Circumstances” permitted in Indiana in 1820, when 
the Indiana Seminary was established, which later be- 
came the State University at Bloomington. In 1817 
the territory of Michigan established a college which, 
in spite of its name, — Catholepistemiad, or University 
of Michigana, — eventually grew into the great univer- 
sity of that state. 
East of the Alleghanies the leaven of state control 
had not ceased to be active; and in 1819 Virginia, after 
an unsuccessful attempt to gain control of the College 
 
-P-A-G-E-302
  Rep. Com. Ed. 
1880, p. xxii. 282 fligher and Special Education 
of William and Mary, established its State University at 
Charlottesburg. In this enterprise Jefferson was the 
prime mover; and the wisdom of his plans has been 
fully demonstrated, not only by the subsequent history 
of this institution, but of others which have taken it as 
a model. With the exception of Maine, which founded 
its university in 1867, no state north and east of the 
Old Dominion has found place for a state university, 
for the universities in Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Ver- 
mont, though bearing the name of the state, are, in all 
essentials, private institutions, and the University of the 
State of New York is but an examining body, without 
teaching functions. But the establishment of state 
universities in the West and South came as a matter of 
course, and has kept pace with the stars upon the flag. 
Those states which were formed out of public lands 
—twenty-seven in all—received the donation known 
to-day as “university lands,” and displayed wisdom in 
varying degrees, in its investment. Nearly all, however, 
used what was not lost through political jobbery, in one 
or more higher institutions of learning. These were 
usually broadly academic in their nature, though not 
always, as in the case of Illinois which used her grant 
for the foundation of a normal school. Up to 1862, 
roughly, a dozen states were maintaining institutions of 
a higher grade, no one of which was more than a strug- 
gling college, with a limited number of students, trying 
to do what it could upon the meagre revenues of what 
had been saved from the earlier land grants. Hardly 
one of these institutions could to-day be considered 
more than of secondary grade. 
By the passage in 1862 of the Morrill Act by Congress 
all this was changed. The act provided for a grant of 
30,000 acres of land for each representative and senator 
in Congress. This land was to be “in place” where 
the state contained a sufficient quantity of public land 
subject to sale, at $1.25 per acre; and of scrip, represent-
-P-A-G-E-303
  
Colleges and Universitzes 283 
ing an equal number of acres, where the state did not 
contain such land. The grant conveyed in all 9,600,000 
acres, 1,770,000 of which was land in place, 7,830,000 
in the form of scrip. The amount raised by the sale 
of these, varying in different states from $50,000 to 
$750,000, was to be devoted to the support in each state 
of a higher institution of learning, at which technical and 
agricultural branches should be taught. 
Of the purpose of the Morrill Land Grant Act, Presi- 
dent Draper says:— 
“Tt had a distinguishing purpose in view. That was to carry the 
advantages of education to those engaged in manual industries. 
The older colleges had all pointed toward the time-honored learned 
professions. Congress recognized the industrial changes consequent 
upon the introduction of machinery, the advent of steam and elec- 
tricity as elements in industrial progress, and the material develop- 
ment incident to the civil war... . By taking the grants and 
complying with the fortunate conditions on which they are made, 
and at the same time giving enthusiastically of their own store to 
combine therewith the disciplinary and culture studies and supple- 
menting the whole with provision for the old and many new profes- 
sional courses, the newer states had the most comprehensive univer- 
sity foundation the world has ever seen.” 
As a result of this grant, within twenty years prac- 
tically every state in the Union has established such a 
school, either in connection with some already existing 
college or as a new institution. Many of the latter were 
agricultural colleges pure and simple, while in a number 
of states the money was used in the foundation of a State 
University which should comply with the requirements 
as regards courses of instruction. Among the state 
universities owing their origin to the Morrill Act are 
those of California, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska, 
Nevada, Ohio, West Virginia, and Wyoming. At these 
institutions military training is required of all male 
students. Coeducation is universal. A part, though 
not all of the state universities in existence in 1862, 
were the recipients of their state’s allotments of land 
through the Morrill Act, Draper, (V), (I).

The table shows that in a little more than twenty-five 
years the number of students in attendance at the state 
universities has increased nearly twenty times (fourteen 
institutions added during the period), and that the 
number upon their faculties to-day exceeds by about 
one-half, the number of students in 1875. It shows that 
since 1885 the student body has increased eight times 
and the faculty seven times. Six out of the ten largest 
universities in the country (1903) are upon the list, and 
more than that number which are doing work of as high 
a character as any. 
Financially these institutions are in a prosperous con- 
dition. The income from the land grant makes it cer- 
tain that no one of them can be reduced to absolute 
penury, and for the most part the states have been gen- 
erous, and either by means of a “mill tax,” or by general 
appropriations made at each session of the legislature, 
have provided for their wants. Many of them, too, have 
been the recipients of private benefaction. In all, tuition 
is free, or practically so, except in the professional depart- 
ments. Not all maintain such departments, though of 
the whole number, thirteen have medical and fifteen legal 
departments. No one of them supports a theological 
school. fy ¢

c. THE DEVELOPMENT OF MODERN UNIVERSITY 
ConpITIONS 
     
   The American college of early colonial days was an 
nstitution of learning which took boys at an age, usually  
-P-A-G-E-306
  286 fligher and Special Education 
varying from twelve to twenty years, who had had, at 
most, a few years’ schooling, put all through the same 
course of study for a period of four years, and gave 
them the bachelor’s degree. The American university 
of to-day, in its most elaborated form, is an institution 
which takes young men and women of an average age 
of eighteen years and a little more, who have had 
twelve years’ instruction in our primary and secondary 
school systems, keeps them for periods varying from 
three years (in special instances) to seven, allowing them 
to take practically what they want, and giving them 
one, two, or three degrees according to the length of 
time spent in study, with the possibility even of adding 
two or three others, if more than one professional course 
is taken. The history of Harvard University shows 
practically every stage in the development from the one 
to the other of these extremes, and, taking the country 
as a whole, institutions could be selected which to-day 
are illustrations of each successive step. The differ- 
ences between these two extremes in higher education 
are at least six: viz. those of —

a. In discussing the organization of American col- 
leges and universities, we must at the outset be re- 
minded that the name signifies little. The title 
“university”’ is used indiscriminately by institutions of 
the simplest and of the most elaborate organization, and 
its original medizeval content, of the fqur “faculties,” is 
entirely lost. What the typical American college is,
-P-A-G-E-307
  Colleges and Universities 287 
has been shown in the earlier pages of this chapter, and 
need not be further discussed. The American univer- 
sity is modelled after neither the English nor the German 
types, for the former is but a loose confederation of 
separate colleges, each on its own foundation; and 
the latter is essentially a graduate institution, having no 
distinct college organization whatsoever. Ours, though 
taking its origin more directly from the English than 
from the German type, is a combination of both, in that 
the colleges or faculties within the university are dis- 
tinctive features, though at the same time integral parts 
of it, and that graduate work has an important — and 
increasingly important— place. At Columbia, which 
illustrates the most elaborate type of organization, the 
colleges — Columbia and Barnard — give degrees as 
such (A.B.), while the faculties of Philosophy, Political 
Science, Pure Science, Applied Science, Architecture, 
Law, and Medicine as departments of the university 
grant only (except law) the master’s and doctor’s de- 
grees. University work is according to this scheme, or 
will be, when the Law School is put upon a graduate 
basis, strictly graduate work, and the university degree 
an advanced degree. This interpretation of univer- 
sity work is being more and more widely accepted, 
and it may be that in time the term “ American univer- 
sity” will be applied only to institutions adequately pre- 
pared to offer graduate courses, though in all probability 
the college, or undergraduate department, will generally 
be continued as an essential part of the organization. 
6. REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION 
For admission to the early colleges, a definite, though 
limited amount of study must have been devoted to 
certain prescribed text-books, mostly classical authors. 
To-day the other*extreme reached by some universities 
is simply an assurance of that degree of intellectual Pp. 241, 246, 
254, 257, 207.
-P-A-G-E-308
    288 Higher and Special Education 
development possessed by the graduate of a secondary 
school of recognized standing, without specifying the 
particular studies the individual student has pursued in 
reaching that degree of intellectual development. A 
few institutions exemplify each of these extremes in 
their entrance requirements, though the great mass is 
at present pursuing a mediate course. The tendency 
is, however, in the direction of a lessening of exact 
subject prescription for entrance. Yet this does not 
mean a “letting down of the bars,” for the general 
requirements are constantly stiffening — though at the 
same time broadening —as is shown by the fact that 
the average age of the college freshman is slowly in- 
creasing. At present the entrance requirements of the 
better class of colleges and universities can be met only 
by the student who has the equivalent of a full four 
years’ course in the secondary school, in addition to the 
eight years’ elementary course. On the basis of 
“credits,” one credit representing a subject pursued 
daily (in some instances four times per week) for one 
year in the secondary schools, forty-five credits is the 
usual requirement. Although in a few higher institu- 
tions none of these credits is definitely prescribed, so 
far as subject is concerned, usually a varying number — 
averaging perhaps one-half —must be in certain sub- 
jects, as, for instance, mathematics, English, natural 
science, history, or modern language. The rest may be 
made up from a large number of subjects approved by 
the institution to which entrance is sought. 
In practice, two methods are made use of for ascer- 
taining the fitness of students for college entrance. The 
first is through the examination of each individual stu- 
dent in all subjects which he offers for entrance. The 
second is the acceptance by the colleges of the diploma 
of the secondary school from which the applicant has 
come, as fulfilling all requirements. The former is the 
older method, and is generally in practice with the East-
-P-A-G-E-309
Colleges and Universities 289 
ern institutions. The latter is a later development, and 
is in vogue with most Western colleges, where special 
officers are appointed for the examination of each school 
having a so-called “accredited relation.” Each plan has 
its advantages and its strong advocates. Inthe Eastern 
states, where individual examinations are general, many 
of the higher institutions maintain uniform examinations, 
which are given in various cities, doing away with the 
necessity of a journey to the particular institution se- 
lected, in order to take the test. 
c. ELASTICITY OF COURSE 
The course of study in the early American college 
was wholly prescribed. Each student at a given insti- 
' tution took all that was offered and, consequently, the 
same as each of his classmates. Gradually, when 
it seemed necessary to offer a greater number of sub- 
jects than time would allow a single student to take, 
the problem of selection, which is now the basis of our 
elective system, arose, and the various colleges began to 
experiment in an attempt to solve it. This was not 
until late in the eighteenth century, and the college of: 
William and Mary seems to have been the first seriously 
to grapple with it. At first the college had three schools, 
and the student passed from one to the other in a fixed 
order. The lowest was the grammar school, teaching 
the classics, and, though not pedagogically prerequisite 
to the others, had been a universal requirement. But in 
1770 a rule was passed, allowing “all such youths resi- 
dent in or out of the college who have acquired a compe- 
tent knowledge of common or vulgar arithmetic and 
whose parents or guardians may desire it, to be received 
into the Mathematical [the next higher] school.” A few 
years later Thomas Jefferson became one of the trustees 
at William and Mary, and under his influence the course 
was so broadened that in 1821 he states, in a letter: “at 
u 
   
-P-A-G-E-310
  290 fligher and Special Education 
William and Mary students are allowed to attend che 
school of their choice, and those branches of science 
which will be useful to them in the line of life they pro- 
pose.” The same policy was followed from the start at 
the University of Virginia, which has generally been 
accredited with its origination. Because of its more con- 
spicuous position among the colleges, it became a modei 
for many and had a great influence in introducing the 
modern elective system. 
The general principle of selection of courses has 
worked itself into practice in two ways: first, through 
the arrangement of the subjects of the curriculum into 
groups which must be elected zz toto, pedagogical prin- 
ciples governing the selection of subjects for each given 
group; and, secondly, election, practically unrestricted, 
of individual subjects. The former is the earlier in 
general practice, being recognized in the establishment 
of professional departments in the colleges. Its result 
was a multiplication of bachelor’s degrees, each separate 
course, leading to separate recognition at commence- 
ment. So it was that a quarter of a century ago it was 
the custom for a college to give from two to six separate 
bachelor’s degrees, indicating the special course, arts, 
philosophy, science, literature, language, etc., which has 
been followed. At the present time this modified group 
system is going out of practice, and with it the degrees ; 
so that A.B. is the only first degree that is given at any 
of the more prominent institutions (137 in all, among 
them Harvard, Princeton, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, 
Pennsylvania, Cornell, Leland Stanford, Vassar, Bryn 
Mawr, and the state universities of Michigan, Indiana, 
Virginia, Illinois, and Nebraska). 
This second system, that of free elective, is in practice 
more or less fully in all our higher academic institu- 
tions with the exception, perhaps, of a few whose cur- 
riculum is so restricted as to make it impossible. In no 
one is it absolutely unrestricted, since if no other safe-
-P-A-G-E-311
  Colleges and Universities 291 
guards were put about it, the fact that some subjects 
are pedagogically prerequisite to others prevents utter 
license. In some few institutions this is the only re- 
striction; but in by far the larger number, either some 
few subjects are definitely prescribed, or the breadth of 
selection is restricted within certain limits, or a combi- 
nation of both of these plans is in vogue. It is proba- 
ble, in fact, that no two institutions are administering 
the elective system in exactly the same manner, though 
each observes the same general principle. According 
to Professor Phillips, there were, in 1899, out of ninety- 
seven colleges and universities of high rank which he 
studied, seven, viz.: Cornell, University of Cincinnati, 
Leland Stanford, William and Mary, and the state 
universities of Missouri, Virginia, and West Virginia, 
in which the breadth of elective was unrestricted by 
rule, while it was practically so in Harvard, Columbia, 
Yale (1903), and the University of Washington. Johns 
Hopkins and the University of Kansas, too, varied 
but slightly from these in their plan. He showed also 
that thirty-four of the whole number studied (ninety- 
seven) had 70 per cent or more of their courses elective ; 
twelve had from 50 to 70 per cent elective, and fifty-one, 
less than 50 per cent. In this latter group are included 
the larger number of the smaller colleges, only Princeton 
and Brown of the larger ones being within it. 
The whole question of freedom of electives, both in 
the college and in the secondary school, is one upon 
which there is a wide difference of opinion among edu- 
cators. All are agreed that the principle should be rec- 
ognized, but the exact extent of its administration is the 
mooted question. Under the early system of prescribed 
course, it is probably true that efficiency along special 
lines was sacrificed to general culture: under a system 
of unrestricted election the reverse might, in individual 
cases be true. Whether, in the long run, the latter dan- 
ger is as serious as the former in its results, remains to 
be seen. Phillips (III).

d. LENGTH OF COURSE 
Four years has been the length of the American col- 
lege course, and very few institutions have varied from 
it. The University of Pennsylvania, in its early years, 
offered but three years’ work, but in general the length 
of course has been the one feature upon which there 
has been a practical unanimity of opinion. Four years 
was, in fact, for a good part of our educational history, 
the essential requirement for graduation and the meas- 
ure of accomplishment, rather than the completion of a 
definite amount of work judged by courses taken. With 
the introduction of the latter criterion of proficiency — 
and it is now universal—and the addition of profes- 
sional departments, the question of shortening the 
college course has come up, and is to-day one of the 
important questions in higher education. It is as yet 
prominent only in a few of the larger universities, where 
the professional schools are mostly graduate, and is 
raised by the fact that if the full four years of aca- 
demic college work is required, students cannot attain 
the professional degrees until about twenty-six years of 
age, and cannot hope to be self-supporting in their pro- 
fessions until nearly thirty. This is believed by many 
to be too long a period to devote to educational prepara- 
tion for life. The solution of the problem of shortening 
this period has been attempted in different ways. At 
Harvard it has been through the arrangement of the 
courses in such a way that the bright student, especially 
if he be given university credit for some work done in 
the secondary school, which is not unusual, may com- 
plete the required work for graduation in three. years. 
Large numbers of students at Harvard are now doing 
so, although the requirements for graduation, measured 
in courses, are higher than ever before. The so-called 
“Columbia Plan,” which is also in practice in some 
other institutions, maintains the four years’ work for
-P-A-G-E-313
  Colleges and Universities 293 
the bachelor’s degree, but makes it possible for a stu- 
dent who is planning to enter one of the professional 
schools of the university to devote a considerable part 
of his senior college year to work in that school, gradu- 
ating from it one year earlier than would otherwise be 
the case. That is, although the college course and the 
medical course is each four years, the student may com- 
plete both courses in seven years. President Butler has 
also urged the establishment of a distinct two years’ col- 
lege course. Of this plan he says: — 
“Whether the completion of such a two years’ course should be 
crowned with a degree is to me a matter of indifference. Degrees 
are the tinsel of higher education and not its reality. Such a two 
years’ course as I have in mind would imply a standard of attain- 
ment at least as high as that required for the degree of A.B. in 1860, 
which had many characteristics which we of to-day persistently 
undervalue. .. . The compromise plan as to degrees now becom- 
ing so popular, whereby the baccalaureate degree is given either for 
two years of work in a professional school, or for three years of col- 
lege study and one year of work in the professional school is dis- 
astrous to the integrity of the college course. It deliberately shortens 
the college course by one year or two, while proclaiming a four-year 
college course. It is a policy which only university colleges can 
adopt and independent colleges must suffer if it becomes a fixed and 
permanent policy.” 
The plan for atwo years’ college course here advocated 
has been in operation for a number of years in the Uni- 
_ versity of Chicago, in connection with the full four years’ 
course. With the completion of the two years’ course, a 
certificate is given granting the title of Associate in the 
University. The provision meets the need of many who 
cannot take a longer term of residence, and of those who 
ought not to take a longer course. Just what the out- 
come of the whole question of shortening the college 
course may be, cannot now be said, but as our pro- 
fessions became more and more specialized, it would 
seem that some concessions of time must be made, or we 
shall be in danger of seeing the elimination of the bac- 
calaureate degree, as is the case in Germany. Ed. Rev. Sept.

é. GRADUATE WorK 
The most important development of our higher insti- 
tutions of learning during the last fifty years — for it 
hardly reaches back farther than that — has been in this 
graduate work; that is, in university work, properly 
speaking. As that of a professional nature is treated 
in the next chapter, those courses of an academic 
character only are considered here. 
As far back as 1800 there are mentioned in the Har- 
vard catalogues certain “ resident graduates,” though just 
what the character of their work was is not plain; cer- 
tainly they were not matriculants for advanced degrees. 
During the earlier part of the nineteenth century Ameri- 
cans who wished to carry their academic studies farther 
than what was demanded in the colleges for the bach- 
elor’s degree were forced to go to Europe for proper 
instruction. Edward Everett was the first to take a 
foreign degree, except in professional subjects, receiving 
the Ph.D. from the University of Gottingen in 1819. 
During the next quarter of a century a considerable 
number of Americans pursued advanced studies abroad, 
among them J. G. Cogswell, George Bancroft, and 
R. B. Patton. The influence of such men, upon their 
return, was sufficient to arouse the somewhat general 
interest in advanced instruction to a point of university 
action, and about the middle of the century several of 
the larger institutions made direct provision for graduate 
students. Yale was the first to do so, announcing in its 
catalogue of 1847 the establishment of a department of 
philosophy and arts for scientific and graduate study. 
As early as 1843 Professor Thacher had advocated “the 
establishment of a system of advanced instruction for 
graduates, which should furnish the opportunities for 
continuing their studies beyond what was possible 
within the four years’ course of the college,” and for 
some years Professor Silliman had unofficially done this,
-P-A-G-E-315
  Colleges and Universities 295 
but formal action was not taken until 1847. In 1861 
the first degrees of Doctor of Philosophy were given to 
three men. A distinct graduate school was not organ- 
ized until 1872. In 1874 the old practice of conferring 
the Master of Arts degree “in course” was changed for 
the system of granting it only after at least one year of 
graduate study. The former plan was practised by nearly 
all the colleges, up to a comparatively recent date, and 
is with the smaller ones even to-day. It practically 
allowed every graduate of three years’ standing, who 
made application for it and paid the fees, to receive his 
master’s diploma. The custom did much to lessen re- 
spect for the degree. It was, however, so bestowed at 
Harvard until 1874, at Michigan and Princeton until 
1877, at Columbia—untit-18$0, and at Brown until 
1891. 
In 1856 Columbia formulated an elaborate plan for 
graduate work in three separate schools, viz.: letters, 
science, and jurisprudence. All led to the degree A.M. 
The plan was not fully carried out, but in 1881 gradu- 
ate instruction was emphasized through the introduc- 
tion of advanced courses in nearly all the college 
branches of study “open to all bachelors of arts, of sci- 
ence and philosophy, of this or of any other college of 
equal standing.” The degree A.M. was conferred upon 
the completion of one year’s work. The scheme was 
capable of almost indefinite expansion, and has devel- 
oped into one of the strongest graduate schools in the 
country. The Doctorate of Philosophy was first given 
in 1884. 
The Harvard catalogue of 1860 is the first to an- 
nounce any definite plans for graduate instruction 
there, through the statement :— 
“ Graduates of the university or of any other collegiate institutions 
desirous of pursuing studies at Cambridge without joining any pro- 
fessional school may do so as resident graduates.”

-P-A-G-E-316
  296 Higher and Special Education 
Until 1872 the degree A.M. only was conferred, but 
since that date the Ph.D. has been conferred annually 
to students fulfilling the requirements of at least three 
years graduate work and an acceptable thesis. This is 
now the usual requirement for the degree in the larger 
institutions. 
At Princeton, graduate instruction was first offered in 
1877-1878. At Cornell and Johns Hopkins, graduate 
work has been prominent since their organization ; and at 
the latter especially, it has been so emphasized as to give 
the institution a most enviable reputation for scholar- 
ship. The development of graduate instruction during 
the last twenty years, not only within those institutions 
in which it was for that time offered, but throughout our 
whole body of universities, has been very rapid. Many 
have perhaps attempted it without adequate equipment, 
and would better have confined their efforts to work of 
a less advanced character, for which they were fitted, 
yet the progress as a whole is healthy and most 
encouraging.

Colleges and Universities 207 
A report made by the Federation of Graduate Clubs 
shows that in 1897, of the 3204 graduate students in 24 
of the leading universities of the country, 35.4 per cent 
were pursuing literary and language studies; 20.6 per 
cent, historical and social science studies; 14.2 per cent, 
natural science; 18 per cent, philosophical studies ; 
II.I per cent, mathematical subjects. 
The principal advanced degrees conferred for work, 
other than that of the professional schools, are those of 
A.M. (Master of Arts), M.S. (Master of Science), Ph.D. 
(Doctor of Philosophy), and Sc.D. (Doctor of Science). 
The first is the oldest, having been, as has been shown, 
conferred by many institutions “in course” for many 
years. The others are the direct product of graduate 
schools. The M.S. has commonly been given as a sec- 
ond degree in institutions where the B.S. is conferred, 
but with the gradual elimination of that degree, is becom- 
ing less frequent. 
The following table shows the number of Ph.D. and 
Sc.D. degrees awarded in the United States for 1898 to 
1903 inclusive, by the universities offering courses lead- 
ing to these degrees. The degree Sc.D. was conferred 
but comparatively few times during these years, (but 
twice in 1903), and seems to be gradually going out :—

It will be noticed that five universities are distinctly 
in advance, and that a large majority of the degrees — 
“From Science. 
 
-P-A-G-E-319
  
Colleges and Universities 299 
four-fifths — are conferred by seven universities. There 
has been no considerable change in the position of the 
universities during the years covered by the records, 
though there is apparently an increase at Columbia and 
Michigan, and a decrease at Clark and Johns Hopkins. 
Besides the degrees conferred by reputable institutions, 
fraudulent degrees of all sorts are upon the market, 
though decreasingly so, owing to stringent legislative 
action. 
Although the degrees A.M. and Ph.D. have been for 
years, and still are occasionally, given causa honoris, 
sentiment seems to be in favor of doing away with the 
custom, and of preserving those degrees, as well as some 
others, from academic prostitution. The Association of 
Graduate Clubs has taken action in the matter, urging 
“that the degrees of Ph.D., Sc.D., M.D., and Pd.D. 
[and A.M.] should never be given honoris causa or in 
absentia.” L.H.D., S.T.D., D.D., LL.D., D.C.L., and 
Mus.D. are recognized as honorary degrees. 
J. LITERARY AND SCIENTIFIC PRODUCTIVITY 
Although in most other respects the American uni- 
versity differs materially from those of the German em- 
pire, in the matter of publications it is fast approaching 
them. In its early days it was what the American col- 
lege now is, solely an institution for giving instruction. 
With the introduction of graduate work and better facil- 
ities for investigation, together with a more learned 
faculty, came a change in the attitude toward original 
work, until now a contribution to the sum total of knowl- 
edge is considered a no less important function of the 
university than is its perpetuation in the classroom. 
The larger universities make considerable provisions 
both in matter of instructor’s time and in the financial 
budget, for original research; and large numbers of mono- 
graphs and special articles appear each year, over the 
 
-P-A-G-E-320
  Thurston (VI). 300 Higher and Special Education 
signatures of the advanced students and of the instruc- 
tional force. The theses of the candidates for the Ph.D. 
degrees alone form no unimportant contribution to human 
knowledge. Many of these productions appear in the 
literary and scientific magazines, or are privately pub- 
lished; but a number of the larger universities maintain 
special publications as a medium for the presentation of 
the researches, both of their faculty and students. 
At Harvard, ten such serial publications are issued ; 
at Johns Hopkins, twelve; at Columbia, seven; at the 
University of Pennsylvania, eight; and at the University 
of Chicago, eight; besides, in most instances, other 
magazines of a more general nature edited by members 
of the faculty. 
Occasional series, moreover, of volumes of a more ex- 
tended nature, such as the Yale Bicentennial and the 
Chicago Decennial publications have been issued, each 
comprising studies of much more than an ephemeral 
nature. Such a constant contribution to knowledge as 
our universities are now making is an educational force 
not to be underestimated, and one which bids fair to be 
of increasing value as time goes on. 
g- THE GENERAL RESULTS 
It is difficult to evaluate a force in education, for it 
is impossible to say what the conditions would be with 
any particular force left out. It is, however, safe to say 
that our higher educational institutions are much more 
than fulfilling the most sanguine hope of their founders, 
in the sturdy men and women which they are turning 
out. Of them Professor Thurston says : — 
“The great financiers of the country are now usually college 
men; the heads of railways are often of that class though they may 
have begun at the foot of the ladder; all distinctively learned men 
are of that class; our greatest men in literature, science, and art are 
practically all educated and cultivated men; the inventors of the
-P-A-G-E-321
  
Colleges and Universities 301 
telephone and the telegraph were both educated, and, in fact, learned 
men; all the great men in medicine and in surgery are college men; 
all the great lawyers and every great jurist on the bench is of the 
same rating. We make our Presidents of learned men and usually 
of college men. The same is true of the members of the cabinet, of 
the judges on the supreme court bench, of the chiefs of bureaus and 
practically all men in highly responsible positions. Our foreign 
ministers and ambassadors, where reflecting special credit upon 
their country, like Lowell, and White, and Hay, and Chester, have 
been, not only college men, but distinguished for their attainments 
in the highest fields of academic learning.” 
The contribution which the college course makes to a 
man’s success is even in a way capable of statistical 
demonstration. In a biographical dictionary of living 
Americans which appeared in 1900 are the names of 
8602 who had achieved more than the ordinary success 
in some calling. A mention of this number of names in 
the volume in question means, if we assume that every 
inhabitant of the United States above the age of twenty- 
one was eligible to such mention, that one in each 600 was 
so honored. This then, would be our ratio of “ success” 
for all degrees of education — good, bad, and indifferent. 
We find, however, that of the whole number mentioned, 
3237 had received the bachelor’s degree in arts, litera- 
ture, science, or philosophy at some college or university. 
But a study of the alumni lists of such institutions shows 
us that after the commencement season of 1899 there 
were 334,000 living graduates. A comparison of the 
number mentioned in the book (3237) with this whole 
number alive shows us that one college graduate in each 
106 found a place. Here, then, we have the ratio of 
success for college graduates. But to carry our process 
of comparison one step farther: taking 1:600 as the 
ratio of success for the adult American and 1: 106 as 
that for the college graduate, we find that the proba- 
bility of success is increased more than 5.6 times by a 
college education. This tremendous advantage can 
probably not be attributed entirely to the direct educa- 
 
-P-A-G-E-322
3 | 302 fligher and Special Education 
tional effect of such a training, but, to a considerable 
extent, to the selective influence of the course. Of the 
whole number of pupils who enter the elementary 
schools, but a very small percentage continues to the 
completion of the college course. This comparatively 
small number of persisters does not fairly represent 
what our educational machinery could have done with 
the entire number who started at the bottom, but what 
that machinery can do with the kind nature had endowed 
with sufficient energy, determination, and persistence to 
enable them to withstand the temptations to drop out 
one by one by the way, and take a seemingly short cut 
to some zguis fatuus of success, but who continue to the 
end. There is here shown undoubtedly with consider- 
able force the potency of the law of the survival of the 
fittest, if we take as our criterion of fitness mention in ' 
the book in question. This, however, does not invali- ) 
date the fact that the college course, either because of 
its educational or selective influence, increases largely, 
perhaps to the extent we have shown, the probability 
that the graduate will gain a favorable place in the 
public eye. 
It is, moreover, possible to show, by means of a still 
P. 237. further study of the names in this book; that of the 
college men, those of high rank in their studies have 
achieved the greatest success of all. In fifty colleges 
and universities are chapters of Phi Beta Kappa, the hon- 
orary fraternity to which are elected roughly the first 
one-sixth of the senior class each year. For twenty-two 
of the colleges studied the names of 2.1 per cent of 
their living alumni were mentioned in the biographical 
dictionary, while 5.9 per cent of their Phi Beta Kappa 
graduates found place there. This would seem to mean 
that the latter’s chances of eminence in his chosen call- 
ing are about three times those of his classmates as a 
whole. It means also, that the college ideal is a true 
one. The high grade man in college has realized most  
-P-A-G-E-323
Colleges and Universities 303 
nearly the ideal of his alma mater. He is its best prod- 
uct, according to its criterion of success, and is given its 
highest stamp of approval. If he fails in life, it means 
that, judged by another criterion — that of society in its 
broadest sense—he is not a success; that the two 
criteria are different, based upon different ideals, and, as 
a corollary, since life is the final test, that the college 
ideal is not a practical one, and that the aim of higher 
education is false. If, however, he holds first place in 
life, as he did in the preparation for it, we must conclude 
that the two ideals, that of the college and that of the 
civilization of which it forms a part, are coincident ; 
that, in terms of the ultimate test, the college ideal is a 
good one, and that our American higher institutions of 
learning are meeting the demands of modern social and 
economic conditions.

  CHAPTER XVI 
PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION 
For nearly two centuries after the establishment of 
the first college at Cambridge, Massachusetts, but occa- 
sional and sporadic attempts at specialization in higher 
education had been made in America. It is true that, 
during the later years of that period, some few special 
schools for each of the so-called learned professions had 
been established, but the students in attendance were so 
few, and the successes so moderate, as to argue that 
the people, as a whole, had not felt the need, as yet, 
of special preparation on the part of their ministers, 
doctors, and lawyers, beyond what could be had in the 
academic institutions, and for the two latter professions, 
apprentice work under some competent practitioner. The 
earlier colleges had courses especially arranged to meet 
the needs of the pulpit, and were established in many 
cases, primarily, as theological schools. The application 
of their courses to the demands of medical or legal prac- 
tice was not so direct, though furnishing a broad founda- 
tion. It is estimated that among the thirty-five hundred 
physicians in the country at the close of the Revolution, 
not more than four hundred had received medical de- 
grees, and it is doubtful, if among the lawyers, the num- 
ber having received legal instruction in any institution 
of learning was even so great as that. But as time 
went on, and the subject-matter to be covered in any 
adequate professional preparation was increased, the 
educational machinery adapted itself to the new de- 
mands, and special departments, or schools, sprang up 
wherever the need seemed to be the greatest, some in 
connection with colleges already founded, and some as 
307

separate institutions. Theology was first to enter the 
field, with medicine second, and law the last among the 
three great professions. Pharmacy, dentistry, and vet- 
erinary practice, as specialties in medicine, followed in 
order, until we have to-day upwards of five hundred in- 
stitutions preparing specialists in these various callings. 
a. THEOLOGICAL EDUCATION 
Although, as has already been said, the earlier colo- 
nial colleges were founded, primarily, as feeders for the 
ministry, they had, by the close of the eighteenth cen- 
tury, to such an extent lost their distinctively religious 
tone as to make it seem wise, to those especially inter- 
ested in the perpetuation of denominational creed, to 
set up separate schools or departments for the protec- 
tion of its purity. As a consequence, the theological 
schools arose. Previous to their origin it had not been 
uncommon for prominent clergymen to take under their 
special care, one or more candidates for the ministry, 
and somewhat after the manner of the physician’s or 
lawyer’s apprentice, to direct their education. In some 
few cases, where a considerable number of students were 
gathered around a single instructor, something approxi- 
mating a school of theology was organized. Dr. Joseph 
Bellamy conducted such a private school in Connecticut, 
near the middle of the eighteenth century, and some of 
his pupils established similar schools a little later. They 
had, however, no bearing upon the general development 
of schools of theology, since such schools were given rise 
to by the need of the students, while the modern theo- 
logical seminary is, in almost every case, the embodi- 
ment of a desire on the part of a religious denomination 
to fill its pulpits with men schooled in its own tenets, 
and practically in every case, though nominally not so 
in a few, instruction is denominational. They are, asa 
consequence, all separate institutions, or connected with
-P-A-G-E-329
  
  Professional Education 309 
colleges which at one time were, or still are, under the 
control of some religious denomination. But 3 of 
the 148 theological schools in operation in 1902 were 
avowedly non-sectarian. The others were controlled by 
more than 20 separate denominations, as follows : —

Several other denominations support one each. 
The first religious denomination to establish a theo- 
logical school in this country was the Dutch Reformed 
Church in America. In 1784 Dr. John H. Livingston, 
pastor of the Collegiate Church of New York City, was 
elected by the synod to be professor of divinity in the 
church at large. Until 1810 Dr. Livingston, in connec- 
tion with his pastorate, taught students gratuitously. 
Other ministers of the denomination, in various locali- 
ties, were also appointed professors, but all students 
were required to be examined by Dr. Livingston, and 
receive a testimonial of proficiency from him before be- 
ing licensed to preach. About ninety men were thus 
graduated between the years 1784 and 1810. In the 
latter year Dr. Livingston gave up his pastoral work, 
accepted the presidency of Rutgers College at New 
Brunswick, New Jersey, and the professorship of theol- 
ogy therein. Since that time, theological instruction 
has been conducted there, with the exception of a few 
years in the early nineteenth century, when work was 
suspended. Until 1864 the courses in theology consti-

tuted a department of Rutgers College; but since that 
time has been under separate maintenance. 
The Roman Catholic denomination was the next to 
establish a theological school in America, through the 
foundation of St. Mary’s Seminary in Baltimore, in 
1791. Its curriculum is, and always has been, broader 
than that in most theological schools, including courses 
in philosophy and science. Its start was not encourag- 
ing, so far as attendance is concerned, there being but 
five students during the first three years, and none at all 
from 1795 to 1797. It is, however, at present in a 
prosperous condition. 
The only other theological institution dating back into 
the eighteenth century is that of the United Presbyterian 
denomination, now at Xenia, Ohio, which was founded 
in 1794, at Service, Pennsylvania. In 1821 it was re- 
moved to Chambersburg in the same state, and in 1855, 
to its present location. 
The Congregationalists were first to enter the field in 
New England, through the establishment of Andover 
Theological Seminary at Andover, Massachusetts. It 
was a pioneer in theological instruction, and has been a 
great force in its denomination, as well as in broader 
religious movements throughout its entire history. A 
second school was founded by the Congregationalists at 
Bangor, Maine, in 1816, and is still in active operation. 
The Princeton Theological Seminary, the first, as well 
as the most influential in the Presbyterian denomina- 
tion, dates from 1812. At the start it had one professor, 
three students, and no building of its own. Ten years 
later it had a faculty of three. 
In 1816 the oldest school supported by the Latheran 
denomination, Hartwick Seminary, was opened invOtsego 
County, New York. ant 
The General Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal 
Church at New York City was the earliest of that de- 
nomination, first giving instruction in 1819. For the 
 
-P-A-G-E-331
    
Professional Education 311 
next two years the work of the seminary was conducted 
at New Haven, Connecticut, but since 1822 has re- 
mained in New York City. It is to-day one of the 
wealthiest theological schools in the country, with a fac- 
ulty of nine professors and five instructors. 
In 1820 Hamilton Theological Seminary, the first min- 
isterial school of the Baptist denomination, was opened 
at Hamilton, New York, and has ever since been con- 
ducted there. In 1893 the seminary was absorbed by 
Colgate University, also at Hamilton, and is now the 
theological department of that institution. In 1825 the 
Baptists established their second theological school at 
Newton, Massachusetts. 
With these institutions, each of the principal religious 
denominations, with the exception of the Methodist, had 
one or more theological schools in operation by the end 
of the second decade of the nineteenth century. That 
denomination alone failed to see the importance of special 
preparation on the part of its ministers; and it was not 
until 1847 that the first of its seminaries — at Newbury, 
Vermont — opened its doors. The denomination has, 
however, during subsequent years, amply made up for 
its early tardiness in establishing schools, as is shown 
by the table on page 309. 
Theology at the Universities 
Antedating any of the special schools for theological 
instruction, divinity had been an academic subject in the 
curricula of several of the colleges. At the college of 
William and Mary, the organization almost from the start 
included a professorship of the subject, and at Harvard 
the Hollis professorship of divinity dates from 1721, and 
at Yale a similar chair was established in 1781. Noth- 
ing like a definite organization of courses to meet the 
needs of the prospective minister was, however, at- 
tempted at any of the higher institutions of learning Boston Univ.

312 Higher and Special Education 
already founded, until 1819, when Harvard established 
a separate faculty of divinity. Yale followed three years 
later with the founding of its theological department. 
Since that time nearly fifty colleges and universities have 
established theological faculties, while more than a dozen 
independent theological seminaries have entered into 
such relations with neighboring institutions as to enable 
their students to enjoy many university privileges. This 
is illustrated by the relations between the Episcopal Theo- 
logical School at Cambridge and Harvard University, 
and the seminaries of the same denomination at New 
York City and Philadelphia with Columbia, and the 
University of Pennsylvania, respectively. 
With the beginning of the third decade of the nine- 
teenth century, the increase in theological schools was 
so rapid as to make it unwise, in a work of this charac- 
ter, to consider each separately. The following table 
shows this growth by decades for each of the geographi- 
cal divisions of our country made use of by the United 
States Commissioner of Education in his annual re- 
ports :—

several for which the year of establishment could not 
be ascertained, make 150, the number in active opera- 
tion in 1902. As will be seen from the table, the dec- 
ade most prolific of theological institutions was that from 
1860 to 1869, with the twelve years since 1890 showing 
the next largest number. Geographically considered, 
the Northern states — Atlantic and Central — have two- 
thirds of the whole number, while the Western states 
are but meagrely represented, containing roughly but 
4per cent. It is impossible to determine for the earlier 
part of the nineteenth century the growth in faculty, 
student body, and annual output of these institutions; 
but records are available for the latter portion of it, and 
the figures are given in the following table: —

Figures (not shown) disclose the fact that there has been 
a decrease in the total number of theological students for 
each of the last three years, including rgo1, and that the 
number is now less than it was in 1902. This decrease 
for the last three years is not for any one denomination 
alone, for the records show it to be true of each of the 
seven largest denominations considered separately. The 
decrease in the number of theological students has shown 
itself only since 1899, and for the number of graduates, 
only with the classes of 1901 and 1902. What it may 
be in the future cannot be told, but in the past the in-

crease in theological graduates has much more than kept 
pace with the increase in the population. The average 
of the five annual classes in theology from 1880 to 1884, 
inclusive, was 758, while the average of those from 1897 
to 1901 was 1683, an increase of 120 per cent; while the 
increase in population, as shown by the censuses of 1880 
and 1900, was but 52 per cent. Another interesting 
and encouraging fact to any who may fear for the 
future of the ministry, is the marked increase in recent 
years in the number of students in our theological insti- 
tutions who have already taken their academic college 
course. The percentage of those who had taken the 
academic degree for the five theological classes from 
1881 to 1885 inclusive, was 23.6, while for the classes 
from 1896 to 1900 it was 32.6, an increase of no small 
consequence. With the educated ministry much more 
than holding its own, we need have no fear for the pul- 
pit. In fact, under those conditions, a decrease in the 
sum total of clergymen would have some hopeful fea- 
tures about it. The most reliable figures available seem 
to show that about one minister in four, the country over, 
is a theological graduate. 
A study of the educational preparation of 655 clergy- 
men who are to-day filling prominent pulpits shows 
the following : —

combination ; 35.5 for the professional course in all com- 
binations and 29.8 as the total have taken graduate 
work. 
The study of the tabulation of these various kinds of 
preparation, for decades of graduation, as far back as 
1830, throws some light on the gradual changes which 
have taken place during the last fifty years in the char- 
acter of education seemingly most conducive to eminence 
in the pulpit. It shows, first, that the number who 
stopped with the secondary stage (2) has remained prac- 
tically constant. In the light of recent developments in 
higher education, this fact is of no great credit to the 
profession. Second, that the number taking either the 
college or the divinity course alone (6 or c) has decreased 
to a very marked extent, the percentage in each of these 
classes being only about one-third that of fifty years 
before. This fact taken by itself would also seem dis- 
couraging, were it not more than compensated for by 
the more elaborate combinations. For instance, the 
numbers who had taken both these courses had trebled, 
while those who had gone still farther and combined 
graduate work with them, had considerably more than 
doubled in the same time. In other combinations 
there were shown to be but slight changes. These 
fluctuations seem to show that training for leadership 
in the pulpit is becoming more and more extensive and 
general rather than intensive and particular; that a mere 
knowledge of homiletics is not enough; that a liberal 
Weltanschauung is a desideratum. All this is most 
hopeful from the standpoint of the pew. 
The average number of years spent by these emi- 
nent clergymen in educational preparation beyond the 
secondary school was 3.19. 
Admission to Theological Schools 
Of the 165 theological schools in operation in 1899, 
71 required a college degree for admission: 3, the com- Parsons},

pletion of the junior year; 18, of the freshman year; 
19, a three-year high-school course; 6, a two-year; I, 
a one-year; 19, a common school education; 4 have no 
requirements, and 24 are not given. 
Length of Course 
Of the 150 in 1901, 1 offers a two-year course; 103, 
a three-year course; 15, a four-year course; 2, a five- 
year; 1, an eight-year; 4,a varying course, while for 
the remainder the length is not stated. 
For these schools the length of the course in weeks is 
as follows: 40 weeks, one; 70 to 79, six; 80 to 89, two; 
90 to 99, forty-one; 100 to 109, thirty-four; 110 to 119, 
thirteen; 120 to 129, nineteen; 130 to 139, four; 140 
to 149, three; 150 to 159, two; 160, eight; 176, one; 
200, one; and 256, one. The others had courses of 
varying lengths or were not stated. As will be seen, by 
far the greater number have courses of from go to 120 
weeks. These include the three-year schools, the year 
varying from 30 to 40 weeks. A comparison of the 
figures with those for 1875 shows that but a slight 
change in the length of the theological course has taken 
place in the last twenty-four years. Of the ror institu- 
tions for which figures are available for that year, none 
offered a one-year course; 5, a two-year; 71, a three- 
year; 1, a three-and-one-half year; 7, a four-year; 
1, a four-and-one-half year; 4, a four-year, and 11a still 
longer course. The number of months in the school 
year was about the same for each date, indicating, if 
anything, a slight decrease in the average length of the 
theological course for the institutions taken as a class. 
6. LecaL EpucaTion 
The first law school in the United States was estab- 
lished at Litchfield, Connecticut, in 1784, by Judge 
Tappan Reeve, and was conducted there until 1833, in  
-P-A-G-E-339
Professional Education 317 
which year it was discontinued. For the first fourteen 
years of its history Judge Reeves conducted it alone, 
besides carrying on a large practice. It was customary 
in those days for lawyers of prominence to have a num- 
ber of young men in their offices studying law, and in its 
inception the Litchfield Law School was little more than 
an elaboration of office method properly organized and 
supplemented with lectures. As the reputation of the 
school grew, Judge Gould became associated with Reeve 
in the work, and instruction took on a more definite 
form. Both men were brilliant lawyers and had made 
important contributions to the literature of their pro- 
fession. But one other instructor was connected with 
the school; and he, only after the retirement of the 
former in 1820. Students came to it from every state 
in the Union, as then constituted, in all 1024 for the 
entire period of its history, an unusual number of 
whom rose to positions of great dignity and importance. 
Ten governors of states, five cabinet officers, two Jus- 
tices of the United States Supreme Court, eight chief 
justices of states, forty judges of supreme courts of 
states, fifteen United States Senators, and fifty Repre- 
sentatives in Congress were among the number: cer- 
tainly a record of which any school might be proud. 
The course covered a period of fifteen months, and the 
tuition for the whole course was $160 —a large sum for 
those days. No students were taken for less than three 
months. 
Only two other definite attempts to establish schools 
of law were made in the eighteenth century. Both of 
these were in connection with colleges already estab- 
lished, and both were failures, if we may judge from the 
immediate discontinuance of the work. The first was 
at the University of Pennsylvania in 1791, when Justice 
Wilson of the United States Supreme Court was elected 
Professor of Law. His first lecture was delivered under 
most auspicious circumstances, before an audience in-

cluding President Washington and Cabinet, both houses 
of Congress, the Executive and Legislative departments, 
the governor of Pennsylvania, Mrs. Washington, Mrs. 
Hamilton, and a most distinguished assemblage of repre- 
sentatives of the bar. The course was not, however, con- 
tinued beyond the first year, and no further attempts at 
legal instruction were made at the university until 1817. 
Columbia Col. The second abortive attempt during the century, at 
P. 257. Columbia, in 1797, seems to have given fully as much 
promise at the start, for it was made by no less a 
legal light than James Kent, author of the famous Com- 
mentaries. For some reason but a single course of lec- 
tures was delivered by Professor Kent, and sixty years 
elapsed before a department of law, authorized to grant 
degrees, was established at Columbia. 
Harvard Col. It remained for Harvard to establish the first law 
P. 233. school of permanency, with degree-granting privileges ; 
and this she did in 1817. Until 1870 the degree of 
LL.B. was conferred upon all students in attendance 
for three terms, but in that year a full two-year require- 
ment was established. The present three-year course 
dates from 1877, in which year entrance examinations 
were for the first time given. Special students were 
admitted without examination as late as 1893. Under 
a rule first administered in 1896, only graduates of 
approved colleges and those qualified to enter the senior 
class at Harvard were to be admitted, and in 1899 the 
requirements for entrance were still further stiffened by 
demanding a college degree for all. This places the 
law school at Harvard upon a full graduate basis, the 
first in the country. The school had in 1902 a faculty 
of fifteen. 
Previous to the establishment of a faculty of law 
at Harvard, the University of Maryland, in 1812, had 
formally established such a faculty comprising seven 
instructors. Only one of them, however, Daniel Hoff- 
man, Esq., seems ever to have given actual instruction   
 
-P-A-G-E-341
Professional Education 319 
in the subject, and this was not until 1822. Professor 
Hoffman continued his instruction for “several years” 
when the work was discontinued, not to be taken up 
again until 1869, when a final reorganization took place. 
A law department was first established at Yale College 
in 1824, though the LL.B. degree was not conferred 
until 1843. For the first two years after its establish- 
ment, the department was practically a distinct institu- 
tion, though the names of its students were included in 
the Yale catalogue. It was, however, in 1826, formally 
adopted. Judge Daggett was the professor in charge, 
and the school was named after Chancellor Kent. In 
that year ten students were enrolled; five years later 
the number had increased to forty-four. 
The University of Virginia established a department 
of law in 1826, and it has been in continuous operation, 
even during the four years of Civil War, ever since. It 
was in Jefferson’s original plan for the university that 
law, “Municipal and Foreign, embracing the general 
Principles, Theory and Practice of Jurisprudence, 
together with the theory and principles of Constitu- 
tional Government,” should form a prominent part of 
the curriculum, and it is to his insistence that the law 
department was established so early. A two years’ 
course is now maintained. 
The first law school established west of the Alleghany 
Mountains was founded in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1833, in 
connection with Cincinnati College — an academic insti- 
tution already in operation. In 1897 the school was 
absorbed by the University of Cincinnati, and is now 
the law department of that institution. A three years’ 
course is maintained. 
One year after the foundation of legal instruction in 
Cincinnati, in 1834, a professor of law was added to the 
faculty in Dickinson College at Carlisle, Pennsylvania. 
The department was supported by the students enrolled 
in the courses. Steiner, p. 120,

As early as 1835 New York University, then the 
University of the City of New York, took steps in the 
direction of founding a law department, and requested 
Benjamin F. Butler to submit plans to that end. Actual 
instruction was not given, however, until 1838, when 
three professors were inaugurated. The course was 
continued only one year, when the work was suspended. 
It was taken up again in 1859, since which time it has 
been continuous. 
In all there had been up to 1840 ten law schools 
established in the country, of which at least four had 
ceased to be active. The entire output of these 
schools can hardly have exceeded two or three thousand, 
which, for a population of seventeen million people 
would mean that professionally educated lawyers were 
very thinly distributed. The method of studying in law 
offices as a preparation for practice was almost uni- 
versal. With the fifth decade of the century a more 
rapid increase in the establishment of law schools began, 
though not gathering any very great momentum until 
considerably later. The following table shows the pres- 
ent distribution (1902) of such law schools, together with 
the dates of their establishment. The geographical 
divisions are those made use of by the United States 
Commissioner of Education in his reports : —

As will be seen, the total number established during 
this period is 89, which, together with those already in 
operation at its beginning, and two or three, the dates 
of whose foundation could not be ascertained, give us 
102 law schools in operation in the United States in 
1902. The fact that considerably more than one-half 
of these are less than twenty years old, and nearly one- 
half but ten, shows that we are just now passing through 
a period of excessive activity in matters pertaining to 
legal education. 
It is not possible to determine with any degree of 
exactness for the earlier portion of the nineteenth cen- 
tury the increase in teaching force, student body, and 
size of graduating classes for this group of professional 
schools, but such facts are available for the last thirty 
years, and are given in the following table :—

During the period covered by the table, the number of 
persons engaged in teaching law in the schools of the 
United States had increased some ten times, the num- 
ber of students nearly nine, and the average size of the 
graduating class nearly five times. This has varied 
materially from year to year, the smallest class for the 
period being that of 1885, with but 744 members, while 
the largest, that of 1902, contained 3524. During the 
y
-P-A-G-E-346
  322 fligher and Special Education 
thirty years there was in general a marked increase, the 
average number graduating annually for the first five 
years of the period being 1128, while for the last five 
years the average was 3166. A comparison of these 
figures gives us an increase of nearly 200 per cent for 
the quarter of a century, in professionally educated 
lawyers. The figures do not hold true, however, for 
the legal profession as a whole, since they take no 
account of those who entered it without the law school 
diploma. We have to turn to the figures of the tenth 
and twelfth census for light on that point, and we find 
from the first that there were in our country in 1880, 
64,137 who made a living, or tried to, through the prac- 
tice of law, while twenty years later the number had 
swelled to 114,723, an increase of 78 per. cent. 
From these two sets of figures, we see that the pvo- 
Sessionally educated lawyers have increased 200 per cent 
in, roughly, twenty-five years, as based upon the annual 
output, while the number of lawyers of all degrees of 
education has increased only 79 per cent in but a little 
less time. The necessary inference is that there is a con- 
siderably larger percentage of bachelors of law among 
those practising before the bar to-day than there was a 
generation ago. This is not at all to be wondered at, 
considering the rapid increase in the number of law 
schools, and the greater stress that is put upon prepara- 
tion along all professional lines. 
It is possible, by a comparison of the number of 
graduates in law during the last twenty-five years, with 
the total number of lawyers practising to-day, to deter- 
mine roughly the percentage of the whole who are 
professionally educated. The sum total of all the 
graduating classes for the last twenty-five years is 
approximately 45,000, and it is safe to say that the 
whole number of professionally trained lawyers in the 
country to-day does not exceed that many. But, as 
has been stated, there were, in 1900, 114,723 in all, 
 
-P-A-G-E-347
  
  Professional Education 323 
so it seems probable that roughly one in two and 
one-half or 40 per cent have graduated from the law 
schools. Of the graduates of the law schools for the 
last twenty years, about 20 per cent, or one in five, had 
already taken his bachelor’s degree in arts or science at 
some college or university ; the number so doing, how- 
ever, is decreasing from year to year, the percentage 
being 33.8 for the years 1881-1885, and but 17 for the 
years 1895-1899. 
A study of the educational preparation of 857 lawyers 
of eminence throughout the country throws some light 
on the kind of training which seems most conducive to 
the greatest success, as follows : —

The striking thing in this table is the large number 
who continued their schooling no farther than the 
secondary stage (a). The study by decades gives us 
little encouragement on this score, since the decrease in 
this class in the last fifty years has been but 11 per cent 
(46.2 per cent in 1840, 35.4 in 1890). With so largea 
number of men able to achieve distinction before the 
bar without much use of the educational machinery, it 
would seem as if this were not so essential to success 
in this profession as in the others. Itshows, also, that the 
schools are not our only educational factors. The study 
by decades further indicates that the number taking the 
academic degree alone (6) is decreasing (23.1 per cent 
to 14.6 per cent in fifty years), and that at the same time 
those depending for success solely upon the professional 
school (c) has considerably more than doubled (11.5 per
-P-A-G-E-348
  324 fligher and Special Education 
cent to 27.1 per cent). The large increase in the num- 
ber taking the professional course alone would seem to 
imply that intensive study is most conducive to success 
inlaw. Of the 857 lawyers covered by the special study, 
we find that 45.9 per cent had taken the academic 
degree, either alone or in some combination, which, com- 
pared with the 27.2 per cent of the rank and file, gives 
us a probability of achieving eminence just about 
doubled through its attainment. As regards the pro- 
fessional course, we have the unexpected showing of a 
somewhat larger number of bachelors of law among the 
rank and file of the profession than among the eminent 
men. This is undoubtedly due in large part to the fact 
that for earlier decades covered by our study the law 
school was practically unknown, and also that the large 
classes of legal graduates of later years have hardly had 
time to achieve distinction. On the whole, the legal 
profession is, from the standpoint of the schools, less 
broadly educated than are the others, and will undoubt- 
edly remain so as long as entrance to it is guarded only 
by a bar examination which demands but a technical 
knowledge of the law, and is, the country over, such a 
variable quantity. 
Admission to Law Schools 
In the matter of entrance requirements, the law schools 
of the country differ materially. In many cases, only a 
knowledge of the rudimentary branches of common 
school instruction is expected, while in others, though 
they are very few, a college diploma is demanded. On 
the whole, the prerequisites to admission are rapidly 
stiffening, the lead being taken in this respect by the 
departments of law connected with the colleges and 
universities. Seventy-six of the total one hundred have 
such connections. In the greater number, these require- 
ments for entrance to the law departments are the 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
  
Professional Education 325 
same as to other courses, though they are often inter- 
preted with greater lenience. Of the eighty-six law 
schools in 1899, the stated requirements for admission 
were as follows: two required some college work; three, 
a four-year high school course; twelve, a three-year 
high school course; eleven, a two-year course; eight, 
a one-year course; twenty-six, a common school edu- 
cation ; sixteen state no requirements; and eight are not 
given. 
Length of Course 
For the first half-century of legal education in this 
country, the courses in the law schools were for the 
most part loosely organized; there was no prescribed 
order for the subjects, and in many cases no definitely 
prescribed amount of work for graduation. Students 
frequently attend for a brief period, in order to supple- 
ment the work of the office; but a comparatively small 
proportion taking all the work offered, or remaining to 
graduate. In many of the schools but one year’s work 
was offered, and in the remainder, two years’. In 1875 
there was but a single school offering more. At about 
this time, however, the courses began to lengthen, and of 
the fifty-eight law departments and schools in 1892, no 
less than fifteen were maintaining a three-year course. 
Of the 100 in 1901, 7 offered but one year’s work; 
38, two years’; 53, three years’; and 2 are giving a four- 
year course. The total length of the course in weeks 
for these schools, varying from 34 weeks to 154 weeks, 
is as follows : — 
30-39 weeks, five; 40-49, four; 50-59, one; 60-69, 
eight; 70-79, twenty ; 80-89, ten; 90-99, eleven; 100- 
109, twenty-seven; I10-119, nine; 120-129, three; 
140-149, one. 
The usual school year is 36 weeks, and we find the 
multiples of this number, 72 and 108 for the two and 
three year courses, the most common. Parsons, Legal

Method of Instruction 
The method of instruction in vogue in most of our 
law schools at the present day, as it was in all until a 
comparatively recent date, is that of the lecture. In 
some instances this is supplemented by recitation from 
the text-book. In a comparatively few schools the so- 
called “case” method is in practice, which consists 
mainly of a discussion and explanation of a limited 
number of selected cases intended to cover each point. 
It is essentially the inductive method applied to legal 
instruction, and the schools which are making use of it 
—among them some of the leading schools of the 
country —argue strongly its superiority. The Moot 
Court is a feature in nearly all schools. 
Admission to the Bar 
Even in the earlier colonial days, some formal licensing 
of practitioners before the bar seems to have been very 
generally demanded in this country. In Massachusetts, 
Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Delaware, the cere- 
mony was simply that of taking an oath, without ex- 
amination of any sort. 
In Virginia and New York the licensing of attorneys 
was placed in the hands of the governor. In Connecti- 
cut the county courts, and in Pennsylvania and South 
Carolina the justices, were given this power. The ten- 
dency has been, however, to place the bar examination 
in the hands of examiners appointed by the state. The 
American Bar Association has recommended that the 
state court of last resort be given this power, and in 
several states this has been done. The prerequisites to 
the examination vary with the different states, though 
in most, from two to three years’ legal study is de- 
manded, together with a moderate amount of academic 
training. The exact conditions for admission to the bar,  
-P-A-G-E-351

as determined by the American Bar Association in 1go1, 
are as follows: —

c. MepicaL EDUCATION 
The medical schools of colonial days in America were 
the offices of the practising physicians. The ranks of 
the profession were recruited through the apprentice 
system, and of the 3000 physicians in practice at the 
close of the Revolution, it has been estimated that not 
more than 400 had received the medical degree; and 
these, with the exception of the 51 graduates from the 
two schools which had already been founded, had taken 
them abroad. As, however, was the case in the other 
learned professions, particularly successful practitioners 
gathered around them in some instances small circles of 
 
-P-A-G-E-352

Pp. 251. 328 figher and Special Education 
followers, supplemented the work of their regular prac. 
tice with talks and lectures, for which they sometimes 
charged a set fee; and so, with a minimum of organiza- 
tions, started what might be called medical schools. 
Such centres of instruction existed in Philadelphia as 
early as 1745, and in New York City in 1750 the human 
body was dissected for purposes of medical instruction 
before a body of students under the direction of Drs. 
John Bond and William Middleton. This was perhaps 
the first anatomical laboratory in the country. In 
1752 Dr. William Hunter of Newport, Rhode Island, was 
conducting such a school, and ten years later Dr. William 
Shippen of Philadelphia began annual courses of medi- 
cal lectures, illustrated by dissections of the human body, 
which were continued until the Medical College of 
Philadelphia, now the Department of Medicine of the 
University of Pennsylvania, was founded in 1765. This 
was the first medical school in the country. Dr. Ship- 
pen was appointed Professor of Anatomy and Surgery, 
and two other professorships were established in the 
school. The first commencement was held in 1769, ten 
men receiving the degree of Bachelor of Medicine. This 
degree was bestowed somewhat commonly as late as 
1813, preliminary to the doctorate, which was given for 
a year or more of additional work. At the Philadelphia 
school the price of a ticket for a single course of lectures 
was fixed at an amount not to exceed “six pistoles” 
($20), with an additional matriculation fee of 20s. 
Upon graduation, each student was also required to pay 
a fee of not less than one guinea to each professor, and 
“likewise the usual fees for the seal of his diploma and 
for the increase of the library.” With the exception of 
a brief period during the Revolution, the sessions of the 
first medical school have been continuous, though since 
1791 it has been an integral part of the University of 
Pennsylvania. After that date, the doctorate was the 
only degree given by it in medicine. The school now
-P-A-G-E-353
Professional Education 329 
has a large faculty, and is one of the leading medical 
schools in the country. 
In 1767 a second medical school was established. 
This was not in its origin a separate school, as its pred- 
ecessor had been, but a medical department in connec- 
tion with King’s College, now Columbia, at New York 
City. It began with a faculty of six, one of whom, Dr. 
Middleton, has already been mentioned as having been 
active in medical instruction in New York City at a still 
earlier date. The first degree of Doctor of Medicine to 
be conferred in the country was bestowed at the com- 
mencement of the school in 1770 upon two students 
who had taken the bachelor’s degree a year earlier. 
In 1813 the faculty of medicine at Columbia was 
allowed to resign, in order to accept similar positions in 
the College of Physicians and Surgeons, established in 
1807. Until 1860 the latter was maintained upon an 
entirely separate basis, and the university had no medi- 
cal department. In that year, however, the college was 
again annexed, though in part preserving a separate or- 
ganization until 1891, when, by an act of the legislature, 
it became again an integral part of its parent institution. 
It has to-day one of the first medical equipments in the 
country. 
Harvard was the second of the academic institutions 
to provide medical instruction, which it did in 1782 by 
the establishment of a medical department. The first 
degrees were conferred in 1788, though the doctor’s 
degree not until 1811. In 1810 the work of the school 
was removed to Boston, where it has since been carried 
on. It is conducted on a strictly graduate basis, Recent 
gifts of several millions of dollars lately made the 
school will, when invested, give it an equipment ahead 
of any in the country, if not in the world. (“7 
For fifteen years after the establishment of the medi- 
cal department at Harvard, no other school entered the 
field. The next to do so was Dartmouth College, also a Columbia Col,

New England institution, founding a medical school in 
1798, with Dr. Nathan Smith as Professor of Medicine. 
Although the faculty of the school has always been 
particularly strong, it lacked clinical advantages until 
1893, when the Mary Hitchcock Hospital was established. 
The fifth school of medicine to be established was at 
Baltimore, Maryland, in 1807, as the Medical Depart- 
ment of the University of Maryland. It began work 
with a faculty of six and a student body of hardly more 
than that number. Lectures were at first delivered at the 
homes of the professors, and occasional clinics were held 
at the almshouse and at the Maryland Hospital. Work 
has been continuous since the foundation of this school, 
which is now in a prosperous condition. 
During the decade from 1810 to 1819 two other medi- 
cal schools were founded in the country: one in con- 
nection with Yale College in 1813, the other the Medical 
College of Ohio, at Cincinnati, Ohio, now the Medical 
Department of the University of Cincinnati. At the 
former institution several previous attempts had been 
made to organize a medical faculty, but without result. 
The school opened with a faculty of four, and an enrol- 
ment of thirty-one students. Latin and natural phi- 
losophy were prerequisites to entrance. The student, if 
a college graduate, must study with a physician three 
years, and if not a college graduate, four years; and in 
any case take one full course of lectures, to receive a 
license to practice. Two courses were required for the 
degree Doctor of Medicine. In 1814 a class of three 
was graduated. Since that time the work of the school 
has been continuous. 
These nine schools of medicine had been established 
in the country and were in operation at the end of the 
second decade of the nineteenth century. There were, in 
1902, 154, of which 123 are of the old school, 10 are 
eclectic, and 21 homeopathic. Without classification as 
to kind, the following table shows the geographical

As will be seen, the Central states, both South and 
North, have a large proportion of the whole number. It 
is a noticeable fact, too, that the last two decades have 
seen the foundation of nearly one-half of the schools 
the country over. 
In an admirable article Dr. Frank Billings, president 
of the American Medical Association, says of the 
medical schools of the country : — 
“In the earlier days of our country, the need of physicians was 
met by the organization of medical schools which were, as a rule, 
proprietary in character. These schools attempted the education of 
physicians on the then existing conditions of medicine by teaching 
in a didactic way the principles and theories of medicine and surgery. 
The branches usually taught at that time consisted of anatomy, 
physiology, chemistry, materia medica, obstetrics, the practice of 
medicine and of surgery. But little opportunity was offered in the 
great majority of the schools for extensive practical teaching in 
anatomy or chemistry, and but a moderate amount of clinical work 
in the so-called practical chairs. The course of medicine in the 
college consisted of two annual sessions of four or five months. 
The course was not graded. The student attended all the lectures 
and clinics taught during his first year, and the second year was a Science, 
May 15, 1903.
-P-A-G-E-358
  332 Fligher and Special Education 
repetition of his first. This class of schools was rapidly increased 
in the course of time. The chief reasons therefor were the fact that 
it was recognized that a connection with a medical school was profit- 
able, directly or indirectly. The prestige which the teacher enjoyed 
among the graduates and the laity brought him a remunerative con- 
sultation and private practice. In most of the states it was easy to 
incorporate and obtain a charter for a medical college. It cost com- 
paratively little to conduct and maintain the institution. Lecture 
rooms were obtained at trifling cost. The dissecting room was not 
worthy of the name of laboratory, and the chief expense in maintain- 
ing it was the cost of dissecting material, which was usually deficient 
in quantity and poor in quality. Medical schools were organized 
all over the country, without reference to the needs of the people. 
Medical education was prostituted. To obtain a sufficient number 
of students many institutions showed a most degraded disregard of 
the moral and mental qualifications of the matriculates. The income 
of the school was wholly derived from the tuition of students, and no 
applicant was turned away who had the cash with which to pay his 
way. To add to the facility of obtaining a medical college course, 
there were organized in some cities evening schools, the hours of 
college attendance occurring from 7 to g or 10 o'clock at night. 
These sundown institutions enabled the clerk, the street car conduc- 
tor, the janitor, and others employed during the day to obtain a 
medical degree. 
“Tn spite of the general tendency to increase the facility by which 
a medical degree could be obtained, there was a force at work to 
improve the methods of medical education. A few older medical 
colleges and an occasional new one set the standard high in relation 
to the existing status of medicine. There were earnest, forceful 
medical men in some of the schools who fought for a higher standard 
for matriculation and graduation.” 
That the rapid increase in schools of medicine shown 
by the previous table, and commented upon by Dr. Bill- 
ings, was equalled by a growth in faculty, student body, 
and size of graduating classes, is shown by the following 
table : —

The sum total of graduates during the twenty-five years’ 
period (112,000) compared with the total number of phy- 
sicians in the country in 1900 (132,225), makes it seem 
probable that about three-fourths of the whole number 
have had the special preparation of the professional 
school, a much larger proportion than for either law or 
theology. Of the graduates in medicine, only 7.5 per 
cent had already taken their academic degree, a much 
smaller number than of other professions. I have no 
figures upon which to base a calculation of change in this 
respect. Of physicians of note, I have the vite of 540, ‘The Author,

aration most conducive to success in this profession. J 19°3 
The facts disclosed by this study show one of two things : 
either the medical profession as a whole contains a very 
small number of uneducated persons, or education is a 
more necessary stepping-stone to eminence within it 
than in most other professions, for all but 38 (7 per 
cent) of our 540 had continued their schooling beyond 
the secondary stage, and the larger number of these had 
entered the profession more than forty years ago. A 
comparison of the professional and academic education 
of the rank and file in medicine with that of the leaders 
gives us some striking results. The census figures and 
those of the commissioner of education for graduates

334 Higher and Special Education 
of the medical school, taken together, show that 74.4 
per cent of the whole fraternity are professionally edu- 
cated, while of our picked men, the percentage is 75.3; 
a difference so slight as to indicate that the professional 
course alone is at no great premium in the struggle for 
recognition. But if we take 7.5 per cent as represent- 
ing the college-trained physicians, good, bad, and indif- 
ferent, we find that the academic degree seems to increase 
their chances for success nearly six times, 41.9 per cent 
of our eminent men having had that training. It is hard 
to see how the college course should be of such vast ad- 
vantage to the physician, and it is safe to assume that 
it is not to him as a simple practitioner that it counts for 
so much. Most physicians of note are scientists and 
investigators, contributors to their art, as well as expo- 
nents of it, and it is along the line of productiveness that 
the broader academic training would be most helpful.

Three particularly interesting things are shown by a 
study of these figures from the standpoint of the period 
at which practice was begun : — 
1. A decrease in the number of physicians who have

school. (a) Of those who have been forty years in the

harness, 9.5 per cent were of this class, the number 
gradually decreasing to 3.6 per cent for those entering

tions placed upon the practitioner have much to do with 
this, but even examinations have not been able to do 
much for some other professions. 
2. A gradual increase in the numbers combining the 
college course with the professional, the growth being 
from 3.4 per cent for the decade 1840-1850 to 22.9 per 
cent for that from 1890-1900. Although many of the 
moves in the direction of making medicine strictly a 
graduate study are too recent to show in our figures, 
the pioneering of Johns Hopkins is perhaps responsible 
in part for this increase. Certain it is that the next 
decade will see much more marked advances in this 
direction. 
3. A swelling of the numbers who avail themselves of 
the graduate advantages of our home universities (0), 
they having increased sixfold in the last fifty years. 
As regards training abroad, two things are shown: 
the number of those who had received their entire edu- 
cation abroad is decreasing (3.4 to 1.8 per cent in fifty 
years), and, second, those who combine some European 
study with the college or medical course is on the in- 
crease (1.7 to 7.2 per cent in the same period). 
The medical profession has a right to be proud of its 
educational status. It is safe to say that it has dis- 
tanced all others in the rapid strides with which it has 
covered the formerly unexplored confines of its field, and 
recovered it from the mere fetichist and necromancer. 
Is it too much to ascribe this rapid advance, at least in 
part, to our educational machinery ? 
The average time in years devoted by these physi- 
cians of eminence to preparation beyond the secondary 
school was 4.09. This is considerably more time than 
is invested by members of either of the other learned 
professions in their educational preparation.

  336 Higher and Special Education 
Admission to Medical Schools 
According to James Russell Parsons, the entrance re- 
quirements maintained by the medical schools in the 
United States in 1899 were as follows : — 
“One required a college degree (in 1903, three): 12, a four- 
year high school course: 3, a three-year course: 12, a two-year 
course: 97, a one-year course: 29, a common school education, and 
2 not stated.” 
The tendency is in the direction of a stiffening of en- 
trance requirements, especially in the schools which are 
connected with colleges and universities. Of the whole 
number, 74 have such connection. 
Length of Course 
Of the 154 schools in operation in 1902, but 4 
schools had less than a four-year, 2 of this number 
were offering two years, and 2, three years. In 1903, 
3 were put upon a four-year basis. The number of 
weeks in the school year varies from 22 to 42 weeks, as 
follows: 1, twenty-two; 6, twenty-four; 44, twenty-six ; 
4, twenty-seven; II, twenty-eight; 3, twenty-nine; 26, 
thirty; 4, thirty-one; 24, thirty-two; 10, thirty-four; 
13, thirty-six; 3, forty; 2, forty-two. 
In 1875 the courses in the 80 medical colleges of 
the United States were very much shorter, there being 
at that time not one offering a four-year course, 32 
with a three-year course, 1 with a two-and-one-half 
year course, 36 with a two-year, 5 with a one-year, 
and. the rest unstated. The number of weeks in the 
school year was also at that time considerably less, there 
being 20 schools in which it was 20 weeks or less. On 
the whole, the length of the medical course has nearly 
doubled in twenty-five years.

Legal Requirements for the Practice of Medicine 
Previous to the Revolution but two colonies had 
passed any legislation bearing upon the licensing of 
physicians. New York in 1760 decided that no person 
should practice medicine in the city of New York with- 
out being examined and properly licensed. New Jersey 
passed a similar law in 1772. Soon after the Revolu- 
tion, most of the states took action in the matter; and 
by 1840 nearly all had passed laws intending to protect 
the people from the imposition of the quacks. To-day 
such legislation is universal, though differing materially 
in different states, as is shown by the following table 
compiled by the commissioner of education. 
Synopsis of the Requirements for the Practice of Medicine 
in the United States 
Classification. — The states may be classed in four groups, accord- 
ing to the requirements for securing a license to practice. 
I. In the first group may be named the states which require an 
examination, diploma of a recognized medical college, and certain 
preliminary educational attainments ; viz., Delaware, Louisiana, Mary- 
land, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, 
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin. 
Il. In the second group are those requiring an examination and 
a recognized diploma; viz., Arizona, California, Connecticut, District 
of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, 
Maine, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, 
Porto Rico, South Dakota, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington. 
III. In the third group are those requiring an examination only; 
viz., Alabama, Arkansas, Kansas, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Mis- 
souri, North Dakota, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, West 
Virginia. 
IV. In the fourth group are those requiring a diploma of a recog- 
nized school or an examination; viz., Colorado, Kentucky, Nevada, 
New Mexico, South Carolina, Wyoming. 
Mention has not been made of the usual requirements that the 
applicant shall be twenty-one years of age, of good moral character, 
and pay a fee varying from $5 to $25. It should be remembered, too,

that these regulations are frequently changed by legislative amend- 
ments or board provisions. 
The Philippines. — The requirements are an approved diploma 
and an annual tax of $50 to $150, according to income. 
Methods in Medical Instruction 
In the early days of medical schools, instruction was 
almost entirely through lectures, in some instances illus- 
trated by means of models and dissections. Gradually 
text-books were more and more made use of as the 
supply warranted, and later the laboratory, the clinic, 
and actual practice in the hospital or at large have been 
considered very necessary elements. Very recently the 
“case” method has been followed by a few instructors, 
and bids fair to become as popular as the same method 
has in legal instruction. The plan is to secure printed 
histories of actual cases, which are fully discussed by 
instructor and students in connection with the actual 
treatment of similar cases in the clinic or hospital. 
At a recent meeting of the National Confederation 
of State Medical Examining Boards it was voted that 
before a student should receive the degree of Doctor 
of Medicine he skou/d have attended in a well-equipped 
medical school, four courses of lectures of at least six 
months each. These courses to embrace at least 3300 
hours actual work in school, including, besides didactic 
lectures and recitations, 
a. 500 hours laboratory work, 
6. 150 hours practical work, 
c. One or more obstetric cases personally attended, 
d. 750 hours clinical teaching. 
All in a school which can command at least 300 hospital 
or dispensary cases for presentation to its classes. When 
this shall be the preparation of every young medical 
practitioner, we need have little fear for the standing of 
the profession.

d. ScHoots oF DENTISTRY 
Although the surgical care of the teeth is a matter of 
record since the time of Herodotus, it is only within a 
century that such care has formed a specialty in surgery ; 
and it was not until 1839 that the first school for the 
preparation of such specialists was founded. This was 
the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery. In 1845 a 
similar school, now a department of the University of 
Cincinnati, was established; in 1856 and 1865 schools 
in Philadelphia; in 1865 one in New York City. These 
were all separate schools. But in 1867 Harvard founded 
a dental department, and other universities quickly fol- 
lowed its example, until in 1901 thirty-seven of the fifty- 
six schools of dentistry are departments of academic 
institutions, and are to be found in every part of the 
country. 
The growth in numbers of the student body has been 
very rapid in the last twenty-five years, there being but 
7o1 students in 1878, to 8420 in 1902, 166 of whom are 
women. The course is almost uniformly of three years, 
and the requirements for admission about the same as 
for the medical schools. The degree, Doctor of Dental 
Surgery (D.D.S.), is conferred by all the schools upon 
graduation. 
e. SCHOOLS OF PHARMACY 
The Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, the first of 
its kind in this country, was opened in 1822. This was 
followed in 1823 by the Massachusetts College of Phar- 
macy ; in 1829 by the New York College of Pharmacy; 
in 1838 by the department of pharmacy of Tulane Uni- 
versity in New Orleans; and in 1841 by the Maryland 
College of Pharmacy. Of late years the growth, both 
in the number of schools and of students, has been 
very rapid. In 1878 there were 13 schools, with 1187 
students; in 1902 there were 59 schools, with 4427 stu- Univ. of Cin.

dents, 206 of whom are women. The length of course 
is usually two years, though 3 schools offer a three-year 
course, 3 a four-year course and a combination course 
varying in length. In many, though not all the schools, 
actual experience in a drug store is a prerequisite to 
graduation. 
J. TRAINING SCHOOLS FOR NURSES 
In 1873 there were established in connection with 
general hospitals in Boston, Salem, New Haven, New 
York City, and Buffalo, special schools for the training 
of nurses. These were the first such schools in the 
country. Six others were opened previous to 1880; 
90 between 1880 and 1890; and 350 since that time, 
—one in nearly all the hospitals of any importance, 
either for the sick or the insane, in the country. The 
whole number of pupils in these schools was, in 1901, 
11,590, of whom but 1307 are men. In most of the 
schools the course istwo years. The pupils are given a 
monthly allowance in nearly all schools of from $12 to 
$24, in return for actual service in the ward. No degree 
is given.

CHAPTER XVII 
TECHNICAL AND AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION 
TECHNICAL SCHOOLS 
WitHIn our country, schools of applied science, 
whether the application be to industry and the me- 
chanic arts or to agriculture, are, with but one or two 
exceptions, the growth of the last half of the nineteenth 
century. The first half of the century had seen the 
accumulation of a considerable mass of scientific fact. 
Great progress has been made in physics, especially in 
electricity and chemistry; what had been at first but 
a chaotic mass of unrelated facts was fast becoming a 
science that was not without its effect upon the industry 
of the time. But the discoveries along these lines were 
being made in the laboratories of the classical colleges, 
for those were the only institutions in any way equipped 
for scientific work, and in a classic atmosphere. Yet 
such institutions had never as yet contributed in any 
important way to the progress of industrial develop- 
ment, and were not considered capable, it must be ac- 
knowledged, by the industrial world, of doing so. Theirs 
was supposed to be a different field. Occasional at- 
tempts had, however, been made at a few of the older 
institutions to apply their scientific instruction to prac- 
tical needs. As early as 1792 Samuel L. Mitchell was 
appointed in Columbia College with the title of Professor 
of Natural History, Chemistry, and Agriculture, though 
what instruction he offered in the last subject is uncer- 
tain. Much of the work which Silliman did at Yale

Ren. Pol. Inst. 
P. 345: 344 Higher and Special Education 
was of the greatest value in pointing out the relation 
between the facts of chemistry and the affairs of 
everyday life, and we must consider him one of the 
pioneers in the field of applied science. Except, how- 
ever, for the United States Military Academy at West 
Point, New York, which is in a sense a technical 
school of high rank, no special school for the study 
of applied science was established until 1824. This 
was the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy, 
New York. Many years elapsed before its example 
was followed. The professions of engineering and ar- 
chitecture developed slowly; and not until they were 
considered as more than trades to be learned, was there 
any demand for technical education. This point reached, 
the growth of technical education was rapid, and to-day 
we have 147 higher institutions offering courses in the 
various fields of engineering and architecture, or agri- 
culture, or both. 
Although each of these institutions differs from all- 
the others in some particulars, they fall into four distinct 
classes, so far as organization is concerned. 
a. Technical schools upon private foundations (7). 
6. Technical schools supported in part or wnony by 
national or state appropriations (36). 
¢. Technical schools or departments ‘connected with 
colleges and universities (102). 
d. The national military and naval academies (2). 
The following table shows, for the various geographi- 
cal divisions of the country, the year of establishment 
of classes a and 4, and so many of class c as are receiv- 
ing national support from the legislative acts of 1862 
and 1890 (28). It was not possible in all cases to deter- 
mine the date upon which technical work was begun in 
the established colleges.

It must be borne in mind that this table covers 
only about one-half of the higher academic institu- 
tions, offering technical courses, though, with the ex- 
ception of perhaps a dozen, such as Harvard, Yale, 
Columbia, Chicago, Leland Stanford, all the important 
ones are included. Although agricultural education 
has run parallel in many respects to that in science, 
applied to manufacture and arts, I shall treat the two 
separately. 
a. Technical Schools upon Private Foundations 
As has been indicated, this was the first class to 
enter the field. Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at 
Troy, New York, the oldest technical institution, opened 
its doors in 1825. It was founded by Stephen Van 
Rensselaer, a descendant of the original “patroon” who 
had gained possession of a considerable portion of eastern 
New York early in the seventeenth century. He was a 
Harvard graduate, and was the first to propose a canal 
from the Hudson River to Lake Erie, and as a commis- 
sioner of the state, made the first survey in 1811. The 
founder states his purpose for the school in a letter 
dated November 5, 1824 :—
-P-A-G-E-372
Sherwood, p. 484. 
P. 350. 
  346 fligher and Special Education 
“T have founded a school at the north end of Troy,” he says, “ for 
the purpose of instructing persons who may choose to apply them- 
selves in the application of science to the common purposes of life. 
My principle object is to qualify teachers for instructing sons and 
daughters of farmers and mechanics, by lectures or otherwise, on the 
application of experimental chemistry, philosophy [physics], and 
natural history to agriculture, domestic economy, the arts, and 
manufactures.” 
He further says : — 
“These are not to be taught by seeing experiments and hearing 
lectures according to the usual methods. But they are to lecture 
and experiment by turns, under the immediate direction of the pro- 
fessor, or competent assistant. Thus, by a term of labor, like an 
apprentice to a trade, they are to become operative chemists.” 
It is plain that Van Rensselaer did not have in mind 
the preparation of a professional class in the establish- 
ment of the school. The first senior professor was 
Amos Eaton, who had a great influence in the early 
popularization of scientific studies in the North. Upon 
his death, in 1842, the course of study was reorganized 
and strengthened, and the school became more distinctly 
one of civil engineering. At present the degree of civil 
engineer (C.E.) is offered in that course, and that of 
bachelor of science (B.S.) in general science. The en- 
trance requirements are not so high as in some other 
schools of technology. 
The next separate school of technology was estab- 
lished in 1868, in Worcester, Massachusetts, as the 
Worcester Polytechnic Institute, through the generosity 
of John Boynton of Templeton, Massachusetts. 
During the more than forty years which had elapsed 
since the founding of the school at Troy, great strides 
had been taken in technical education. The Morrill 
bill had been passed, and nearly twenty states had 
availed themselves of its privileges. The Massachu- 
setts Institute of Technology was well started (dis- 
cussed under class 4), and engineering as a profession 
had become an accomplished fact. 
 
-P-A-G-E-373
  
Technical and Agricultural Education 347 
A distinctive characteristic of the Worcester school is 
the large use made of workshops and laboratories. In 
the former, the students construct and place upon the 
market machines of considerable elaborateness, many 
of which were invented by themselves or their instruc- 
tors. In this way the final test of proficiency in manual 
work is reached through commercial competition. Al- 
though the course for mechanical engineers is perhaps 
the strongest in the institute, four others are offered, 
each of four years: civil engineering, electrical engi- 
neering, sanitary engineering, and general science. 
The state of Massachusetts maintains forty scholarships 
at the school, while there are about thirty more to which 
only residents of Worcester County are eligible. 
The third school of class a to be established is the 
Stevens Institute of Technology, at Hoboken, New Jer- 
sey, which was opened in 1871. Professor Henry Mor- 
ton was brought from the University of Pennsylvania 
as its first president; and in connection with R. H. 
Thurston, later of Cornell, as Professor of Mechanical 
Engineering, and others of prominence upon the faculty, 
soon built up a very strong school. Stevens offers but 
one course, that for mechanical engineers; but in con- 
nection with it are introduced many elaborate tests, 
especially with locomotives and steam-engines which 
are not possible in institutions where the equipment is 
divided among several departments. 
The Case School of Applied Science in Cleveland, 
Ohio, was established in 1881. Leonard Case was its 
founder, and directed that in the school should be taught 
“by competent professors, and teachers, mathematics, 
physics, engineering — mechanical and civil—chemis- 
try, economic geology, mining, metallurgy, natural his- 
tory, drawing, and modern languages, and such other 
kindred branches of learning as the trustees of said 
institution may deem desirable.” Eight courses are 
maintained: civil, mechanical, electrical, and mining
-P-A-G-E-374
  348 Higher and Special Education 
engineering, physics, chemistry, architecture, and gen- 
eral science, each leading to the B.S. degree at the end 
of four years with the M.S. conferred for one year more 
of work. The school has about $2,000,000 in produc- 
tive funds and $350,000 in buildings and grounds. 
Two years after the establishment of the Case School 
(1883), the Rose Polytechnic Institute was opened at 
Terre Haute, Indiana, through the generosity of Chaun- 
cey Rose. Dr. Charles O. Thompson, who had been 
instrumental in building up the polytechnic institute at 
Worcester, Massachusetts, was its first president; and, 
although he died shortly after accepting the position, he 
nevertheless had had time to establish the school upon 
similar lines. Four courses of study are offered: me- 
chanical and electrical engineering, civil engineering 
and architecture, and in chemistry, each of four years, 
granting the B.S. degree. The M.S. is conferred two 
years after graduation, if one of them has been spent in 
practice and the other in graduate study. 
The next technical school to be established upon pri- 
vate foundation, the Armour Institute of Technology, 
is also in the West, at Chicago. It was founded by 
Philip D. Armour, in 1893, his gifts to the institute 
exceeding $2,500,000. It offers a full four-year course 
in technical instruction. 
The latest entry into the lists of private technical 
schools is the Clarkson School of Technology at Pots- 
dam, New York, established in 1896. 
6. Technical Schools supported in part or wholly by 
National or State Appropriations 
There are thirty-six such schools in the country, by 
far the greater number of which owe their origin to the 
Morrill Act of 1862. When this is the case, scientific 
agriculture and military instruction are required by law 
to have place in the curriculum. 
 
-P-A-G-E-375
Technical and Agricultural Education 349 
When the various states received their portions of 
land-grant scrip, each with more or less haste disposed 
of a considerable proportion, and proceeded to establish 
courses of instruction as the money realized, permitted. 
Some whose quotas were too small to finance a sepa- 
rate institution, turned the funds over to some already 
established college or university which should comply 
with the provisions of the law. In this way Rhode 
Island gave hers to Brown; Connecticut to Yale; New 
Hampshire to Dartmouth, and New Jersey to Rutgers. 
Many states which had received a larger share, but 
still not enough to carry out the act in all its particulars, 
founded purely agricultural colleges, as instanced by 
Michigan and Iowa. Others divided the funds be- 
tween two separate institutions: one for the agricultural 
branches, favorably located in a farming community, 
and another for the courses in the mechanic arts. 
Massachusetts, with its national grant divided between 
its Institute of Technology and the Agricultural College 
at Amherst, is an example of such division of interests. 
Still another class of states, each with a large share 
of the scrip, determined to carry out the provisions of 
the act in the broadest and fullest possible way by 
applying it all to a single institution which, although 
the mechanic arts branches should receive full at- 
tention, should be a university in the broadest sense. 
To this class belong New York and Illinois. These 
various methods of utilizing the national grant for 
technical purposes have, on the whole, worked well. 
Only in a few cases has the fund been mismanaged, and 
the many-sided institutions which have resulted present 
all phases of usefulness. Of the separate institutions 
for scientific study of any sort—and these are the only 
ones we are considering in this class — ten are designated 
as colleges of agriculture, pure and simple, and thir- 
teen by some title indicating some combination of agri- 
culture with the other applied sciences, for instance,  
-P-A-G-E-376
  350 Higher and Special Education 
the Rhode Island College of Agriculture and Mechanic 
Arts, Mississippi Agricultural and Mechanical College, 
and the Washington Agricultural College and School of 
Science. All are, however, primarily agricultural in 
their interests, and will be considered under agricultural 
colleges. Of the remainder, three, the Alabama Poly- 
technic Institute, the Massachusetts Institute of Tech- 
nology, and Purdue University, the State School of 
Technology for Indiana, are primarily schools of tech- 
nology, though in some instances offering agricultural 
instruction. Four are designated as schools of mines, 
as the Colorado, New Mexico, and South Dakota State 
Schools of Mines, and the Michigan College of Mines. 
The two remaining schools, although offering techno- 
logical courses, put the stress upon military training, 
at least in their titles, as the South Carolina Military 
Academy and the Virginia Military Institute. Not all 
of these institutions receive support from the land- 
grant, but all are state institutions. 
Of those designated as schools of technology, the 
Massachusetts Institute is the oldest, and has exerted 
by far the most important influence upon the develop- 
ment of scientific education. In fact, there is probably 
no other institution of any of the classes considered, 
which has surpassed it in this respect. Although a 
beneficiary of the Morrill Act, it was incorporated in 
1861, before the passage of the act, yet instruction 
was not actually begun until after the Civil War, in 
1865. The institute owes its origin to William B. 
Rogers, who became its first president, and directed 
its interests, with the exception of an interval from 1870 
to 1878, until 1881, when ill health forced him to retire 
from the work, and General Francis A. Walker, one 
of the foremost educators of our times, accepted the 
responsibility. The institute offers thirteen distinct 
courses, each of four years: civil, mechanical, electrical, 
mining, chemical, and sanitary engineering, architec-
-P-A-G-E-377
  Technical and Agricultural Education 351 
ture, chemistry, biology, physics, geology, naval archi- 
tecture, and general studies. Since the latter includes 
most of the academic branches usually taught in a col- 
lege or university, it is possible to pursue a broader 
course at the Massachusetts Institute than at any of the 
other separate technical schools. It is by far the larg- 
est of its class in point of student body. It receives 
but one-third of the state apportionment of the land- 
grant fund, the rest of its income being from tuition 
and private bequest. 
The school of next importance in the strictly techni- 
cal schools of this class is Purdue University at La- 
fayette, Indiana. It is in reality the technological de- 
partment of the State University, though not in the same 
city with the academic departments. It was established 
in 1874. Five special courses are offered: mechanical 
and electrical engineering, agriculture, general science, 
and pharmacy. Except for the latter, each is of four 
years, and leads to the B.S. degree. 
The four institutions whose names imply a special 
application of science to the needs of the mining engi- 
neer are all situated in states of great mineral resources, 
where the interests of the miner are paramount, and 
where ample facilities for studying mining operations 
are at hand. Of them, the Colorado institution is the 
oldest, having been founded in 1873; Michigan coming 
next in 1885; North Dakota following in 1886; and 
New Mexico in 1893. Although the principal stress 
is placed upon the courses of the mining engineer, 
other courses are in every case offered, and work of the 
highest order is being done. The students accompany 
their instructors to mining centres, and in some in- 
stances spend considerable periods of time in service 
within the mines themselves. This class of schools is 
proving of the greatest value in furnishing intelligent 
directors for the development of our mineral resources.

¢. Technological Schools connected with Colleges and 
Universities 
Within this class of schools, which is at once the larg- 
est as well as the most diversified of any so far as 
courses are concerned, come some of the oldest as well 
-as the best technical institutions in our country. In 
breadth of offering they vary from the small college, 
which has combined with its academic work a single 
technical course of a professional character, to institu- 
tions like Columbia University, with eleven distinct 
courses, Cornell with ten, and the University of Illinois 
with seven. Only twenty-eight of the whole hundred or 
more receive support from the land-grant; a small pro- 
portion of the remainder are state institutions, but the 
great majority are upon a private foundation. 
Of them all, the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale, 
although opened in the same year (1847) as the scientific 
school at Harvard, may perhaps with justice be con- 
sidered the oldest, since it was but a continuation of the 
important scientific work of Silliman and his colleagues 
which had been carried on for a quarter of a century 
earlier. The school is what its name implies —a scien- 
tific school rather than a school of technology pure and 
simple, the stress being rather placed upon science 
than upon its application. The courses include civil, 
mechanical, and electrical engineering, chemistry, agri- . 
culture, natural history, mineralogy, biology, mining, 
and metallurgy. The undergraduate course is of but 
three years, though the entrance requirements are so 
much higher than most of the separate schools of tech- 
nology as to make graduates practically equivalent. 
The faculty of the school is distinct from that of the 
university, though some of the instructors are connected 
with both. | 
The Lawrence Scientific School at Harvard was also 
established in 1847. For many years it was maintained
-P-A-G-E-379
  Technical and Agricultural Education 353 
practically as a separate institution, but had gradually 
become more closely united with the university, until 
now it is an integral part of it. It has no separate 
faculty, and its degrees are conferred by the university. 
The school offers eleven distinct courses : civil, mechani- 
cal, electrical, and mining engineering, architecture, 
geology, chemistry, biology, science for teachers, anat- 
omy, and physiology. Its entrance requirements are 
high; practically the same as those for the academic 
departments of the university. With the advantages 
which come from the unsurpassed library, museum, and 
laboratory facilities at Harvard, Lawrence is enabled to 
offer advantages to the student in the less purely ap- 
plied lines of scientific study which are impossible to 
the smaller institution. 
Four years after the establishment of scientific de- Dartmouth Col. 
partments at Harvard and Yale (1851), the Chandler ?- 268 
School of Science was founded at Dartmouth College, 
through a bequest by Abiel Chandler, to set up “a per- 
manent school of instruction in the college in practical 
and useful arts of life.” Its course is broadly scien- 
tific rather than technical. The Thayer School of 
Civil Engineering, also at Dartmouth, is a graduate de- 
partment, established through a gift by General Syl- 
vanus Thayer in 1867. Owing to the requirements for 
entrance, the number of students is small, but the work 
is of a very high character. The only degree given is 
that of civil engineer. 
Other scientific departments of the same general 
class as the Sheffield and the Lawrence schools, in that 
they are connected with colleges and universities upon 
private foundations, are the John C. Green School of 
Science at Princeton University, founded in 1873 —be- Princeton Col.

in addition to those in general science, and special 
scientific or technological schools at Union College, 
Washington University (St. Louis, Missouri), Tulane 
University, Brown University, Leland Stanford Uni- 
versity, Johns Hopkins University, the Polytechnic 
Institute of Brooklyn, University of Cincinnati, Lehigh 
University, Vanderbilt University, and the University 
of Virginia. 
The most elaborately organized scientific department 
at any of the private universities is that under the facul- 
ties of pure and applied science at Columbia University, 
offering, all together, ten separate professional courses, 
besides a large number of less direct vocational applica- 
tion. The School of Mines was opened as early as 1864, 
and has stood practically at the head of such institutions 
ever since. Other schools of architecture, engineering, 
and of chemistry are maintained. Nearly fifteen hun- 
dred students have graduated from these various schools. 
Of the state universities, nearly all of which are 
beneficiaries of the Morrill Act of 1862, thirty maintain 
technical courses. Of them, one course each is offered 
by the universities of Montana and North Carolina; 
two by those of Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Iowa (has 
a state college of agriculture and mechanic arts in 
addition, at which four courses are offered), North 
Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming; 
three each at the universities of Arkansas, Colorado, 
Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Mississippi, Nebraska, Ten- 
nessee, and West Virginia; four at the University of 
Wisconsin; five each at Kansas, Ohio, Oregon, and 
Washington state universities; six at California and 
Minnesota; seven at the University of Illinois; and eight 
at that of Missouri. In their equipment for technologi- 
cal work, the variation among the institutions is even 
greater than in the number of courses, though generally 
speaking it is better than among the colleggs upon 
private foundation. \ 
\  
-P-A-G-E-381
  Technical and Agricultural Education 355 
Of them all, Michigan was the first to offer techno- 
logical courses, which were begun in 1853, though in- 
cluded within the offerings of the college of literature, 
science, and arts, until 1895, when an engineering college 
was established. All courses lead to the B.S. degree. 
The universities of Illinois and Minnesota established 
technical courses at the start (1868), and the University 
of Wisconsin in 1870. These three institutions are, per- 
haps, the leaders among the state universities in matters 
of technical instruction. Each has a magnificent equip- 
ment, large numbers of students, and maintains courses 
of the highest character. It is probably safe to say that 
the general average of technical work done in the state 
universities as a class is higher than that in the colleges 
upon a private foundation, though marked exceptions to 
this occur. 
ad. The National Military and Naval Academies 
The United States Military Academy at West Point 
was established in 1802, though as early as 1783, at the 
close of the Revolution, the question of founding such 
an institution was considered. Although its aim is the 
production of the efficient military officer, it is realized 
only through four years of vigorous training, both physi- 
cal and mental, and its courses include much that is 
found in our best technical schools, of which it might 
with justice be considered the oldest. In fact, until the 
establishment of the Rensselaer Institute, it was the only 
institution in the country offering engineering courses. 
Its courses were at first not of a high order of excel- 
lence, but during the superintendency of General Syl- 
vanus Thayer, who was appointed in 1817, they were 
fully reorganized and placed upon the footing of the 
best military colleges in Europe. This high standard 
it has since maintained. It has graduated in all 4806 
students, who have immediately, upon leaving the school,
-P-A-G-E-382
    ! 
356 fligher and Special Education 
received appointments as second lieutenants in the 
regular army. 
Unlike the other schools of our country, except the 
Naval Academy at Annapolis, admission to West Point 
is only by the Secretary of War, through the nomination 
of a senator or representative in Congress, or by the 
President. In the case of congressional appointments 
there may or may not be a competitive examination for 
the position. Each congressional district, territory, and 
the District of Columbia is entitled to have one student 
at the academy, as well as is each senator, while the Presi- 
dent of the United States appoints forty, usually the 
sons of army officers who have no fixed residence. 
Both physical and mental examinations must be passed 
by the appointee; and these are so rigid as not infre- 
quently to debar a candidate from admission, even 
though the formality of the appointment has been 
made. An allowance of $609.50 per year is made each 
student, which is sufficient, with economy, to defray all 
expenses. During the summer the cadets live in camp, 
but one leave of absence being allowed for the four 
years. 
First year: mathematics, modern languages, history, 
geography, and ethics, drill regulations of artillery and 
cavalry, use of the sword. 
Second year: mathematics, modern languages, draw- 
ing, drill regulations of artillery, infantry, and cavalry. 
Third year: natural and experimental philosophy, 
chemistry, mineralogy and geology, drawing, drill regu- 
lations and practical military engineering. 
Fourth year: civil and military engineering and 
science of war, modern languages, law, history, geog- 
raphy, and ethics, practical military engineering, drill 
regulations and ordinance and gunnery. 
Students who are deficient in their studies are per- 
emptorily discharged, and the discipline, on the whole, 
is even more rigid than in the regular army.

Technical and Agricultural Education 357 
The United States Naval Academy at Annapolis, 
Maryland, was established in 1845. During the Civil 
War it was removed to Newport, Rhode Island; but 
was returned to its old location in 1865. Appointments 
to it are made upon practically the same basis as to 
West Point, except that there are but ten presidential 
appointees. The allowance is $500 annually for each 
student. The course of instruction is for six years, the 
last two of which must be spent at sea. 
For the first four years it is as follows: — 
First year : mechanical drawing, algebra, geometry and 
descriptive geometry, English and French, or Spanish. 
Second year: a continuation of these subjects, with 
the addition of trigonometry, conic sections, differ- 
ential calculus, astronomy, elementary physics and 
chemistry. 
Third year: seamanship, astronomy, elements of 
mechanism, mechanical processes, marine engines, metal 
mechanics, mechanical drawing, physics, including elec- 
tricity and magnetism, chemistry, and international and 
military law. 
Fourth year: seamanship and naval tactics, naviga- 
tion and surveying, instructions for infantry and artillery, 
gunnery, drill, ordinance, experimental engineering, in- 
cluding boilers, naval designing, and construction, and 
special instruction in physiology and hygiene. The 
summers are spent by the cadets in cruises upon the 
practice ship. 
In 1897 a graduate course in naval architecture was 
established. A full reconstruction of the buildings at 
Annapolis is now going on. When completed, the 
academy will be one of the finest naval training schools 
in the world. 
The Course of Study 
With very few exceptions, the course of study at the 
technological schools is four years, and hasbeen since their

  358 LfHigher and Special Education 
establishment. In other respects there is the greatest 
diversity. In the separate schools, whether private or 
public, the curriculum is largely restricted to the pure and 
applied sciences, together with English and modern lan- 
guages. In the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 
however, one finds nearly all the subjects of the college 
curriculum, though this is an exception. In the schools 
of mines, metallurgical studies receive much attention, 
though in other respects the work does not vary mate- 
rially from other technical schools. In the departments 
of science and engineering in colleges and universities 
the possibilities for the student to broaden his course 
are almost unlimited, so far as offerings go, and in those 
institutions where the technical course permits of election 
—though this unfortunately is not the case in many of 
the schools whose courses are primarily for engineers— 
many of the more broadly academic subjects are taken. 
This is especially true in the so-called schools of science 
connected with the large Eastern colleges, which are less 
purely professional than the departments of engineering 
of the great state universities. In the matter of shop 
work, in courses especially for mechanical engineers, 
there is much variation. In a majority of the schools it 
is placed in a very subordinate position in the curricu- 
lum, in some even hardly figuring at all; while in schools 
of the Worcester type, manual construction work occu- 
pies as much as one-fourth of the student’s time. 
The prime centres of activity in all the schools with 
anything like an adequate equipment are the labora- 
tories. These include those of chemistry and physics, 
which in associated departments are used in common — 
with the academic students, and the drawing and draught- 
ing rooms. Besides these are an increasing number of 
special laboratories for the application of pure science to 
the needs of the professional practitioner. These labora- 
tories and their equipment are very expensive, but are 
the characteristic features of the technical school, and
-P-A-G-E-385
Technical and Agricultural Education 359 
are the bases of its particular usefulness. The entrance 
requirements, especially in the separate technological 
institutions, do not presuppose so many years of prepa- 
ration as those of the higher academic institutions. The 
classical languages are not included, and only in a com- 
paratively few schools, modern languages; yet in math- 
ematics the requirements are rigid. In the scientific 
and technical departments of the academic institutions, 
the prerequisites are usually approximate to, and in 
some universities identical with, the other departments, 
making them, generally speaking, a little higher than 
those of the separate schools. 
In 1902, sixteen separate professional courses, not 
counting agriculture and closely allied subjects, were 
being offered in the technical schools of all classes. The 
following table shows the number of institutions offering 
each one of these courses :—

AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION 
Although agricultural interests have always been para- 
mount in the United States, more than two centuries of 
colonial and national life had passed before there were 
any serious attempts made to establish institutions for 
scientific agricultural instruction. When land could be 
had for the asking, and there was no necessity for making 
it produce more than a small percentage of its possible 
crop, there was no need for scientific method in its culti- 
vation. Mere scratching of the surface and a dropping 
in of seed brought reasonable results, and when a piece 
of land was worked out, more was to be had. 
Some inducements to care in farming were held out 
through the prizes offered at fairs, and even before the 
commencement of the nineteenth century, societies for 
the promotion of agriculture were formed in some of the 
Eastern states (New York, 1791; Connecticut, 1792), 
which, with their descendants, the granges, and other 
associations of rural agriculturalists, have undoubtedly 
had a very important influence upon agricultural prog- 
ress, though only in a remote way contributing to 
agricultural instruction. Allusion has already been 
made to the attempt at Columbia at about this time 
to establish courses in agriculture; but they came to 
naught, and so far as we know were not again at- 
tempted anywhere for nearly half a century. It was 
at a university, however, that the second attempt was 
made: this time at Yale, in connection with the Sheffield 
school, one of the first instructors (1847) having the title
-P-A-G-E-387
ESE ENS a eS ee OY 7 RR rane ee TS Te yee aro ae eee ee 
Technical and Agricultural Education 361 
of Professor of Agricultural Chemistry, Vegetable and 
Animal Physiology. But previous to this time the 
national government had interested itself to the extent 
¢ — of carrying on a free distribution of seeds (Department 
of Agriculture not established until 1872), and in many 
states the farmers were urging the establishment of 
schools for agricultural instruction. In 1838 in New 
York State a petition was presented to the legislature, 
containing six thousand signatures, urging the establish- 
ment of such a school, and stating that “there is no 
school, no seminary, no department of any school in ¢ 
which the science of agriculture is taught.” A num- Dabney, p. 606. 
ber of small private schools seem to have resulted 
from this public expression of need, but certainly none 
by state enactment for many years. In fact, the 
first school of such a character did not come in the East 
after all; but it remained for the West, where action 
has usually followed more closely upon conviction in 
matters educational, to establish the first agricultural 
college. This was the Michigan State Agricultural 
College, opened at Lansing, Michigan, in 1857. It was 
given a site embracing 676 acres of heavily timbered 
land, and buildings to the cost of $100,000 were imme- 
diately erected. In 1862 the college was made the 
recipient of the state’s allotment of land-grant scrip, and 
has ever since been one of the strongest agricultural 
colleges of the country. 
Maryland was the next state to found such a college, 
which was opened in 1859, near the city of Washington. 
Public agitation for such an institution was seriously 
begun in Massachusetts in 1849, though a charter was 
not granted until 1856, and actual*instruction not begun 
until 1869. The College of Agriculture is situated at 
Amherst, though it is not in any way connected with ‘ 
Amherst College; it receives but two-thirds of the 
land-grant income of the state. Pennsylvania followed 5.4 mst Tech. 
with an agricultural college in 1859. These four prac- p. gg0.

tically complete the list up to 1862, the year of the 
Morrill Act. 
With the passage of the Morrill Act, an immediate 
impetus was given to agricultural education, since the 
act specifically required that institutions founded under 
it should teach such branches of learning as are related 
to agriculture and the mechanic arts. The twenty-six 
colleges so established and bearing the title “ Agricul- 
tural,” either alone or in connection with some other

In addition to the strictly agricultural courses that are 
offered in all these colleges, one or more of the engi- 
neering courses, discussed in the first part of the chapter,  
-P-A-G-E-389
  Technical and Agricultural Education 363 
are usually maintained. In addition to these, domestic 
science is taught in fourteen, forestry in one (Michigan), 
and horticulture in four. These courses cover in a 
general way the strictly agricultural offerings; yet many 
of the institutions are broadly industrial, and include 
within their curricula a great variety of work. Especially 
is this true in the South. For example: the Alabama 
Agricultural and Mechanical College (colored), besides 
the usual agricultural courses and a normal course of 
four years, announces the following industrial courses: 
carpentry, iron-working, shoemaking, sewing, and print- 
ing, each of three years; nurse training, cooking, and 
laundering, of two years each; broom making, chair- 
bottoming, millinery, and shorthand, each one year. 
The school is not, however, a fair type of the American 
agricultural college. 
In the following fifteen states and territories, the 
agricultural college is a part of the State University: 
Arizona, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Illinois, Louisi- 
ana, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, 
Ohio, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Except in 
method of organization, these departments do not vary 
materially from the separate agricultural colleges. 
In ten colleges and universities, established upon a 
private foundation, agricultural courses are offered: 
four of these, Delaware College, Cornell University, 
Rutgers College, and the University of Vermont, receive 
support from the land-grant. The other six, Berea and 
Knoxville colleges, Harvard, Yale, and Howard uni- 
versities, and the University of Virginia, are the only 
institutions in which strictly voluntary or non-state 
supported courses in agriculture are maintained in the 
country. Of these ten institutions, Cornell makes the 
most extensive offerings in agriculture, and is in some 
ways the leader in scientific agricultural instruction in 
the country. At Harvard the agricultural department 
is known as the Bussey Institution, and is situated at Chapter XV.

Jamaica Plain, a suburb of Boston. At Yale, the agri- 
cultural courses are given in the Sheffield Scientific 
School. At both Harvard and Yale much is made of 
the courses in forestry. In the other private institutions 
of the list varying amounts of agricultural work are 
offered, though, except in those receiving incomes from 
the land-grant, it is usually small. 
Entrance to Agricultural Colleges 
In the various states these vary materially. The feel- 
ing is somewhat general that if the agricultural college 
is to be of most benefit to the rural communities, the 
preparation of rural communities must be accepted; that 
is, the same as that required for admission to a first-class 
high school. This is true very generally in the South 
and some parts of the West. When more is demanded 
by the separate agricultural colleges, a preparatory de- 
partment is frequently maintained. For admission to 
the departments of agriculture connected with the col- 
leges and universities more is usually required, in some 
cases equaling that demanded for admission to the 
other departments. This is true at Cornell and the Uni- 
versity of Illinois. When, however, one is not a matricu- 
lant for a degree, this requirement is not usually made. 
At a recent meeting of representatives of the various 
agricultural colleges of the country, the question of 
admission was fully discussed, and the following list of 
subjects made out “as a standard series of entrance 
requirements to be adopted as soon as possible ” : — 
Physical geography; United States history ; arithme- 
tic, including the metric system; algebra to quadratics ; 
English grammar and composition, together with the 
English requirements of the New England association ; 
plane geometry, one foreign language; one of the natu- 
ral sciences, and ancient, general, or English history.

Course of Study 
In most institutions, the full agricultural course is four 
years in length, and is usually quite fully prescribed. 
This course leads to the B.S. degree in science or the 
degree B.Ag. There are, however, quite generally main- 
tained what are known as short courses, not leading 
to a degree. In many cases these are general courses 
of two years, or (rarely) one year, for students who can 
devote only a limited amount of time to study, but who 
wish a general survey of the field and to get in touch 
with scientific method. 
Again, still shorter courses are offered in many insti- 
tutions, permitting the student to devote all his time, or 
a considerable portion of it, to a single subject. Such 
courses are usually offered in the winter time, when 
work upon the farm is not pressing; and they are open 
to all mature applicants, irrespective of academic quali- 
fication. Thus at Cornell are offered twelve weeks’ 
courses in agriculture and in dairying, and of a single 
term in forestry; and at the Michigan Agricultural 
College, a twelve weeks’ course in chemistry, six weeks’ 
courses in beet sugar production, dairy husbandry, cream- 
ery management, and live stock husbandry, and a four 
weeks’ course in cheese-making. 
In the full four years’ course there is the greatest vari- 
ation in the different institutions. In part this diversity 
is brought about by conditions peculiar to the state. In 
the arid regions of our country, irrigation-engineering 
takes a prominent place, and in most states the peculiari- 
ties of the soil and the character of the staple crop are 
made the bases of specializations: in the corn belt, giv- 
ing rise to special courses in corn culture; in the beet 
sugar regions, to the beet; and in fruit and grain states, 
to those products. That there might be less variation 
in the fundamental branches which should form a basis 
for such variations, the association of agricultural colleges

Experiment Stations 
A most important feature of the modern college of 
agriculture is the experiment station. Involving, as it 
does, the experimental farm as well as many special 
laboratories, it is an essential part of the equipment, but 
is proving of perhaps greater general value as a place 
for the scientific investigation of agricultural problems. 
The general farmer, who must make his land pay, does 
not go far from the beaten path of agricultural pro- 
cedure. In the experiment station, a single crop, upon 
a limited area, may be sacrificed, if thereby something 
of value may be learned; and vast contributions are 
coming from these stations annually, which are doing 
much to put agriculture on a sound, scientific founda- 
tion. 
The first serious attempts at investigation in connec- 
tion with an agricultural school were made at the Bussey 
Institution (Harvard), in 1871, and published in the fol- 
lowing year. In 1873 Professor W. O. Atwater, at 
Wesleyan University (Connecticut), established an ex- 
periment station which has ever since been one of the 
most productive centres of investigation. North Caro- 
lina followed in 1877; New York (Cornell), in 1879; 
New Jersey, in 1880; and Tennessee, in 1882. Up to 
1887, when the so-called Hatch Act was passed by Con- 
gress, appropriating $15,000 annually to each state for 
purposes of agricultural investigation, seventeen such 
stations had been established. Now, each state and 
territory has one. Several hundred reports come an- 
nually from these stations embodying the results of 
special researches, most of them in such form as to be 
easily made use of by the farmers. The importance of 
these scientific contributions to the material prosperity 
of our nation can hardly be overestimated.

Elementary Agriculture 
The introduction of agricultural instruction in the 
public schools has presented another problem to the 
educator. The widespread interest in this subject may 
be judged from the large number of recent texts on 
elementary agriculture, special leaflets and bulletins 
from the experiment stations, together with discussions 
and outlines of the work in school journals, farmers’ 
institutes, and teachers’ associations. In a number of 
states teachers are required to pass an examination in 
elementary agriculture; in some the law requires them 
to teach it. To meet this new condition, certain of the 
state normal schools, as those of Missouri, have intro- 
duced courses in practical and theoretical agriculture, 
and the subject is taking a prominent place in teachers’ 
institutes. Minnesota and Nebraska have each estab- 
lished an agricultural high school. Alabama has an 
agricultural school of secondary grade in each of its 
nine congressional districts. Each of these schools has 
a farm connected with it. Wisconsin has established a 
system of county schools of agriculture and domestic 
science, and also offers some work along the same line 
in the county training school. In some of the states, as 
in Illinois, agriculture has been included in the state 
course of study, private schools have included it in their 
curricula, and the extension work of the agricultural 
colleges is reaching every part of the state. 
All these agencies for the preparation of teachers for 
elementary agricultural instruction are producing valu- 
able results. While some states are discussing the 
problem of ways and means for its introduction into the 
rural schools, others are boldly making the experiment 
with great success. It is now being given in all the 
schools of North Carolina. Georgia, Alabama, and 
Louisiana, too, have taken steps in the same direction ; 
and we may safely predict that in the near future scien- 
 
-P-A-G-E-395
  
  Technical and Agricultural Education 369 
tific agricultural instruction of an elementary character 
will find a place in the better class of rural schools 
throughout the entire country.

CHAPTER XVIII 
THE PREPARATION OF TEACHERS 
Tue_machinery of our educational system did not provide for the special preparation.of the teacher until 
well into the nineteenth century. Teachers there had 
of course been since the beginning of schools; persons 
of considerable dignity, too, in the New England towns, 
ranking next to the minister in social importance, and 
sharing with him certain of the ministerial functions. 
Inthe earlier_ Solonial days grammar echo teachers 
were almost universally college men, but beyond @ knowl- 
edge of the academic Subjects they were to téach, with 
no special pedagogical preparation whatever. In the 
CoTGuies other then, those 2 of New England, schools were 
less frequent, and, generally speaking, the teachers less 
fully educated, The wealthy ce in some instances 
brought educated men from England to act as tutors in 
their own families; and not infrequently these éventu- 
ally established neighborhood schools. demptioners of early days was occasionally a man of 
learning who was pressed into the service of the schools, 
and so the very few schools which had been established 
in the seventeenth century were fairly well provided for. 
During the next century the colleges, though few, were 
sending out graduates in increasing numbers, nearly all 
of whom were either ministers or teachers, or both, for 
it was very common to combine the two callings. In 
those days, too, as with us now, many men who looked 
forward to the professions of law or medicine, spent a 
few years after graduation from college as teachers. 
John Adams, William Ellery Channing, and, somewhat

later, William H. Seward, Daniel Webster, and Salmon 
P. Chase were among those who passed an apprentice- 
ship in the schoolroom, and we may well imagine with 
what excellent success. Besides these two class 
  work, and those who taught but tem 
another important class, made up of undergraduate s stu- 
dents in the colleges, who spent the long winter vaca- 
tions in the schoolroom. Until comparatively recently 
many of the Eastern colleges so divided the year as to 
make this possible, throwing into the school market their 
entire student body for as much as three of the colder 
months. This proved a benefit to the schools, many of 
those in the smaller districts being thus able to secure 
bright, energetic young men who proved the greatest in- 
spiration to the pupils. It is a matter of doubt even, if 
the same schools have ever had as good teachers as a 
class since, even with our modern facilities for the prepa- 
ration of the teacher. With the growth of the private 
  ‘academy came another source of supply for the teach- 
ing force, not so good as the colleges, yet supplementing 
them in a way, and in the few instances of coeducational 
academies, for the first time making women available as 
teachers. But until about the beginning of the third 
decade of the nineteenth century, there had been only 
occasional expressions of opinion that any other than a 
purely academic training was needed by the teacher, and 
up to that time absolutely no facilities had been provided 
for any other training anywhere in the country. As 
early as 1 789 an article ascribed to Elisha Ticknor had 
appeared in the Massachusetts magazine, in which it 
was urged that a grammar school be established in 
each county “to fit young gentlemen for college and 
school keeping.” It was advocated that a board of su- 
pervisors be appointed which “should annually examine 
young gentlemen designed for school masters, in read- 
ing, writing, arithmetic, and English grammar, and if

they are found qualified for the office of school keeping, 
and able to teach these branches with ease and propri- 
ety, to recommend them for the purpose.” Wise as such 
a proposition was, public sentiment was not ready for it. 
Not only were no immediate results produced, so far as 
a school for teachers is concerned, but even the plan 
seems not to have been mentioned again for nearly 
thirty years. This was at a Yale commencement, when 
Denison Olmstead, afterward Professor of Natural Phi- 
losophy in that institution, discussed somewhat fully 
the plan for an “academy for schoolmasters” in his 
oration. Two or three other papers upon the same Gordy, p 10. 
general subject appeared within the next few years, 
but no actual attempt was made to found such a school 
until 1823, and then it was a private institution estab- 
lished by Samuel R. Hall at the little village of Concord, 
Vermont. Hall was a preacher, sent to the place by 
the Missionary Society of Vermont, but on his refusing 
longer to stay, unless allowed to try the experiment of 
a teachers’ school, he was given permission. Soon his 
modest enterprise was attracting more than local atten- 
tion. He maintained a practice school for his teacher 
pupils, and in many ways anticipated the methods of the 
normal schools of to-day. After some years’ experience 
in the work, Mr. Hall published a book entitled Lec- 
tures on School Keeping, which met with an immediate 
success; at least two states (New York and Kentucky) 
purchasing a copy for each teacher in the state. Mr. 
Hall continued to maintain a school for teachers until 
1840, though in 1830 he removed it to Andover, and in 
1837, to Plymouth. 7 
The move for the professional training of teachers was 
now under way, public sentiment in favor of such train- 
ing had become aroused, and even during the earlier 
years of Hall’s venture in Vermont, in at least two 
other states agitation was spirited in the direction 
of some adequate provision for it. The moves were, 
 
-P-A-G-E-400
  Horace Mann, 
ch. vi. ¥ 374 fligher and Special Education 
however, in two different directions; in Massachusetts, ~ 
toward the establishment of special institutions for the 
training of teachers;-and in New York, toward the 
modification of the courses of study in the existing 
academies in such a way as to make them especially 
meet the needs of the teacher. Both these moves origi- 
nated at about the same time, though with the priority 
of a year or two in Massachusetts. In that state James 
“G.Carter may with justice be called the father of the 
movement. In 1820 he published in pamphlet form an 
essay ‘treating, among other educational matters, an 
‘“nstitution for the training of teachers.” One year 
later he put his plan into practice at Lancaster, Massa- 
chusetts. The town did not appreciate his efforts, and 
the institution was short-lived. Not so Mr. Carter’s 
interest, however; and, upon being elected in 1835 to 
the state legislature, he immediately began a campaign 
for a similar institution to be supported by the public. 
In 1837 he drew the bill providing for a state board of 
education, and without doubt his speeches, more than 
anything else, brought about the Normal School Act in 
1838. Another man whose influence was great in the 
move for. normal schools in Massachusetts was Mr. 
Charles Brooks. Impressed with the perfection of the 
Prussian~sehool system in which they were prominent, 
entirely upon his own initiative, he called a meeting of 
all interested in school reform in Plymouth, Massachu- 
setts, in 1835, and so impressed his hearers with the 
importance of normal schools in the country, that con- 
siderable money was then and there subscribed for the 
purpose. During the next two years Mr. Brooks lec- 
tured in nearly all the New England states, as well as in 
some others, “riding in his chaise over two thousand 
miles” in his missionary tour, his subject being ever the 
same: that of the normal school and its needs. It is 
not strange, then, that when Horace Mann began his 
active campaign for the establishment of such schools, 
 
-P-A-G-E-401
  
The Preparation of Teachers 375 
he found the public, at least, not unfamiliar with the 
idea. 
The move for normal schools had not yet been made 
in any state outside of New England, but New York 
was solving the problem of teachers’ training through its 
academies. In 1827 the legislature of that state passed 
an act, which, among other things, was “to promote the 
education of teachers”; but since it was not specified 
how this should be done, the law was productive of no 
results. 
One year later the report of the regents contained 
this statement :— 
“The academies have become, in the opinion of the regents, what 
it has always been desirable that they should be, fit seminaries for 
imparting instruction in the highest branches of English education, 
and especially for qualifying teachers of the common schools.” 
It would be difficult to say in what particulars they were 
especially fit at that time for the fulfilment of the latter 
function ; but the expression of confidence on the part 
of the regents seemed to have the proper effect, for in 
1831 the Canandaigua and St. Lawrence academies re- 
port “principles of teaching” as among the subjects 
offered; the next year two other academies were main- 
taining similar courses, and in 1834 the fifth was added 
to the list. 
In 1832 the board of regents fully discussed the plan 
of training teachers in connection with the academies, 
expressing their reasons for believing it to be a bet- 
ter method than through the establishment of normal 
schools. Special appropriations of school funds were 
made annually until 1844, for the support of these 
teachers’ courses, and up to that time nearly four thou- 
sand students were graduated from them. But upon 
the motion of State Superintendent Young in that year 
they were discontinued, as not fulfilling the expectations 
of their promoters, and the bill establishing the State 
Normal College at Albany passed. So closed in New Regents’ report

schools for teachers. 
In sium e the first public normal schools in 
A the country had béen opened in 1839: one in Lexing- 
CE ton for women and the other in Barre for both sexes. 
At the opening of each, Governor Edward Everett 
delivered a masterly oration, in which he outlined fully 
Barnard,13: 758. the course of study which was to be offered. The 
schools had been made possible largely through the 
generosity of Edmund Dwight, who gave $10,000 upon 
the agreement that the legislature should appropriate 
an equal amount. The school at Lexington was opened 
first upon July 3, 1839, with three students; that at 
Barre following upon September 5 of the same year.! 
Of the school at Lexington, Rev. Cyrus Pierce was 
chosen principal ; and to his tact and untiring devotion 
Pierce. is due, in large part, not only the success of this school, 
but that of the whole normal school movement, which 
depended so largely upon it. 
The minimum course of study was fixed at one year, 
though two might be devoted to it. The subjects of the 
first curriculum were as follows : — 
(1) Orthography, reading, grammar, composition and 
rhetoric; (2) writing and drawing ; (3) arithmetic (men- 
tal and written), algebra, geometry, bookkeeping, navi- 
gation, and surveying; (4) geography with chronology, 
statistics and general history; (5) physiology; (6) men- 
tal philosophy ; (7) music; (8) constitution, and history 
of Massachusetts and the United States; (9) mental phi- 
losophy and astronomy; (10) natural history ; (11) the 
principles of piety and morality; (12) the science and 
art of teaching with reference to all these subjects. 
Students who spent but a year at the school made a 
selection of studies from those offered, determined by 
the character of the school they intended to teach. A 
model school was established at the start, and has been

an important feature of the schools, which have taken 
that at Lexington as a pattern. The location of the 
first two Massachusetts normal schools did not prove 
adapted to the best results, and in 1844 that at Lexing- 
ton was removed to West Newton, and later to Fram- 
ingham, and the Barre school, to Westfield. In 1840 
a third school had been established at Bridgewater. 
The beneficial effects of the schools upon the teaching 
force of the state were soon apparent, and other states 
were not slow to follow the example set in Massachu- 
setts, until to-day every state save Delaware is support-~ 
ing one or more state normal schools; although in some 
instances they are maintained as departments of the 
state universities. In all there are 535 institutions 
(other than high schools) offering courses especially for 
teachers, with 114,353 students enrolled in such courses.

As may be seen by the table, the first state to follow 
Massachusetts in the establishment of a normal school

was New York, the first having been founded in Albany 
in 1844. This has now developed into an institution 
to which the title “college” is applicable, and will be 
mentioned under that head. Connecticut followed in 
1849, Michigan in 1850, Rhode Island in 1852, but the 
school was discontinued after a few years; Massachu- 
setts again in 1854 with a school at Salem; New Jersey 
in 1855, Illinois in 1857, Pennsylvania and Minnesota 
in 1859, with a much larger number during the next 
decade and each succeeding one.“ Not until the close 
of the war, however, was one established in the South, 
though since that time they have been quite fully 
introduced. 
In 1875 there were 70 state normal schools in opera- 
tion with 17,698 students, the states of Delaware, Geor- 
gia, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, 
and Utah, of those then in the Union, being without 
such a school. In 1880 the number was 84, with 15,289 
students; in 1885, 103, with 21,070 students. At pres- 
ent there are 143 state normal schools; but for late 
years no statistics covering enrolment are available 
which differentiate the state schools from others sup- 
ported by public taxation, z.e. class, ¢. 
Admission to State Normal Schools 
With one or two exceptions, all are open to both sexes, 
and women students largely predominate. Tuition is free 
to students of the state. The academic qualifications 
for entrance vary materially in the different states, 
though a great majority of the schools accept students 
with a common school preparation ; that is, the equiva- 
lent of eight years’ schooling. In some states, notably 
‘Massachusetts, a four years’ high school course or its 
equivalent is demanded for admission. According to 
the recommendations of the National Educational 
Association committee on normal schools, the minimum 
 
-P-A-G-E-408

requirement for entrance to the state schools in general, 
should include a reasonable proficiency i in n the e following 
subjects : arithmetic, _ English, grammar, geography, 
United States history, physiology and hygiene, draw- 
ing, Civil-government,-musi¢, grammar school algebra, 
nature study, reading, penmanship, spelling, at and Eng- 
lish’ “In states where the rural schools predominate, 
thésé requirements are not usually maintained. When 
high schools are easily accessible to most of the pupils 
in the state, they are, in many cases, exceeded, Fre- 
quently the model or practice school is made the. fitting 
school-for the normal. 
The Course of Study 
The greater number of the state normal schools offer 
a four years’ course of study intended for students who 
come with the minimum of preparation. Besides this, 
or in combination with it, is in many instances a two 
years’ course for high school graduates, and not infre- 
quently a course of a single year, almost entirely pro- 
fessional in its character, for college graduates. In 
the relative amounts of academic and _ professional 
instruction, the schools differ greatly. In some, and 
this is particularly true of the Pennsylvania schools, 
the academic largely predominates; so much so as to 
make them differ but slightly from the old New York 
academies in the times when teachers’ courses were 
maintained. 
In many of the others professional courses are much 
more prominent, though in all a considerable amount 
of academic work is found to be a necessity. 
The National Educational Association committee on 
normal schools recommends the following as a four 
years’ course: arithmetic, elementary algebra, plane 
geometry, English grammar, English, elements of rhet- 
oric, zoology, botany, physiography, physics, chemistry,
-P-A-G-E-409
  The Preparation of Teachers 381 
nature study, penmanship, drawing, manual training 
(either domestic science or sloyd, or both), reading, 
music, fine arts, sociology, history, civics, economics, 
folklore, general physical education, gymnastics, games, 
school sanitation, psychology, pedagogy, observation, 
and teaching in the training school. Each of the last 
four subjects are to be taken for an entire year, giving 
them a time value of at least one-fourth of the entire 
course. It is doubtful if any school follows this pro- 
gramme in detail, though some few approximate it. . 
Frequently, the course of study is determined by char- 
acteristics peculiar to the state; either the conditions of 
the local schools or the requirements for certification to 
teach. For instance, in the New England states, purely 
professional courses predominate, since the high schools 
easily furnish all that is required along academic lines. 
In the Southern states, where the negro population must 
be considered, and where also secondary education is 
deficient, industrial and academic courses abound. In 
the Pennsylvania schools this is also true, and each of 
the thirteen schools maintains a preparatory department. 
In the Mississippi Valley and the Western states, fewer 
normal schools are maintained than in the East, and, as 
a consequence, some have large numbers of students in 
attendance; that of Kansas having nearly fifteen hun- 
dred, and the Iowa school at Cedar Rapids, considerably 
more. Academic subjects are taught, but only as made 
necessary by the requirements of the professional courses. 
Regarding the course of study in the state normal schools, 
the N. E. A. committee says: — 
“ All these observations lead to the conclusion that there has been 
constant progress in the three-quarters of a century the state normal 
schools have existed. That progress has been both experimental 
and evolutionary. The changes that have come to the possibilities 
and needs have always found the normal school ready to adapt itself 
to the new conditions. The normal school has been so near the 
public thought all this time that it is more nearly to-day an actual 
exponent of public sentiment than any other public institution of N. E, A. Normal

equivalent magnitude. It is specially sensitive to public demand, 
and sincerely endeavors to do for the people what is assumed to be 
essential to prepare teachers for the public schools. This accounts 
for much of the variation that is known to exist at present, and it is 
evident that, with a better knowledge of what has been accomplished 
in the different states in the preparation of teachers, and what ideals 
prevail in producing the different characteristics of strength and suc- 
cessful results now known to be attained, there will be found more 
satisfactory and uniform results, more sympathetic relation among 
the workers in this great field of labor, and a loftier conception of 
what the American teacher must become to fill the place of destiny 
conferred by democracy and Christianity.” 
Observation and Practice Schools 
The practice school is the characteristic feature of our 
state normal schools, and that which distinguishes them 
from the purely academic institutions. They are in 
some instances maintained in connection with private 
normal schools ; and, in fact, with each of the four: other 
classes of professional schools for teachers, but not as a 
rule. With the state normal schools, however, the plan 
was adopted at Lexington with the first school, and has 
since become almost universal. In the practice school, 
the prospective teachers constituting the-student body 
of the normal school are given opportunity, not only to 
observe thé work of expert t t teachers, but also themselves 
to teach, undér the scrutiny of those same experts who 
serve as critics. The development of the practice school 
has closely paralleled that of the normal, though the 
administrative relations between the two differ in differ- 
ent institutions. ‘ In fact, four distinct plans are in vogue 
in the normal schools throughout the country for secur- 
ing practice facilities for their students. The most 
common of these (and it is the one made use of by con- 
siderably more than one-half of the schools), is to main- 
tain a complete practice department, comprising all the 
grades, and in many instances, a kindergarten, within 
the buildings of the normal school, and entirely under. 
 
-P-A-G-E-411
  
The Preparation of Teachers 383 
the control of the normal school authorities. Usually a 
small tuition is charged for attendance at the practice 
schools, and the fact that they can survive in competition 
with the free public schools is a tribute to the excellence 
of the instruction offered within them. 
The second plan is that of utilizing the school system 
of the city or town in which the normal school is situ- 
ated for purposes of observation and practice. In about 
one-sixth of the state normals the plan is in vogue, all 
being situated in comparatively small towns and cities. 
The financial] relations are adjusted in various ways; 
sometimes the normal school furnishes the teachers, 
while the town bears the other expenses of maintaining 
the school. Again, in some instances, the normal con- 
tributes only a part of the teachers’ expenses; while a 
third plan is for the town to pay to the normal school an 
annual sum, equal to the ordinary amount expended for 
school purposes. 
A third method of maintaining a practice school is 
but a modified form of the plan just mentioned. Under 
it, certain schools of the town are set apart for the uses 
of the normal schools, the relations between those schools 
and the normal being the same as those between it and 
all the schools in the other plan. This plan is made use 
of in about one-tenth of the state normal schools. With 
the rest of the normal schools a city ward-school is con- 
ducted in the normal building, practically full privileges 
being given in the way of practice and observation. 
The amount of practice teaching done by the normal 
students before graduation is usually not far from two 
hundred hours; that is, one hour per day for one school 
year. This is usually divided among several grades; 
or, in the case of teachers who are preparing to be spe- 
cialists, among some few subjects. The teaching’ is 
usually in the presence of the critic teacher, whose duty 
it is to note any glaring defects and discuss them with 
the student teachers at some subsequent meeting.

6. PrivATE NorMAt ScHOOLS 
Despite the rapid growth of state normal schools and 
other public means for the training of teachers, they have 
not met the demands of our public school system, and 
large numbers of private normal schools have sprung up 
in all parts of the country. In 1875 there were 56 such 
schools, with 9328 students. Ten years later the num- 
ber was 132, with 23,005 students, and, is in 1902, 118, 
with 23,573 students. They are most abundant in the 
Middle West, nearly one-half of the whole number, with 
about two-thirds of the student enrolment, being in the 
North Central states. These schools vary so greatly in all 
particulars as to make an exact characterization of them, 
impossible. “In the earlier days, before the general 
establishment of state normal schools, some of them, 
particularly in the South, did pioneer work of the great- 
est value, and some few are undoubtedly of high charac- 
ter to-day ; but too large a number are but short cuts to 
the teaching profession. Usually no prerequisites to 
admission are made, other than sufficient maturity; the 
courses are undefined and short, and the accomplish- 
ments are superficial. Not infrequently such schools 
are but subordinate departments of commercial schools. 
From the standpoint of the teaching profession, their 
only excuse as a class, for being, is that the facilities 
for the training of teachers are as yet inadequate, and 
that even the training that the poorest of them give, is 
better than none. The schools are now decreasing in 
number, and the student body is no larger than it was 
twenty years ago. 
¢. Crty Trarintnc ScHOoLs 
Most of the larger cities, and not a few of the smaller 
ones, are in part providing their own schools with trained 
teachers through normal or training schools of their own

maintenance. In 1880 there were 21 such schools, with 
2941 students; in 1885 the number was 25, with 4549 
students; in 1902 special teachers’ courses were main- 
tained in no less than 44 cities and towns in the United 
States, either as a part of the high school curriculum, or 
in especially organized training schools. More than 
10,000 pupils are taking these courses, and nearly 9000 
more are doing similar work in connection with the pri- 
vate secondary schools. The simplest form of city 
training school consists of little more than a fifth year 
of high school work, made up mostly of pedagogical 
courses, together with observation and practice-teaching 
in the grades. Although usually not in any sense the 
equivalent of the normal school course, it is nevertheless 
an efficient means of furnishing the grades with teachers. 
In the city training schools lately established in New 
York City, two years instead of one are devoted to the 
course. 
The Girls’ Normal School of Philadelphia seems to 
have been the earliest of this class, having been organ- 
ized by Joseph Lancaster in the earlier years of the 
last century. The Boston Normal School was founded 
in 1852, and has ever since been one of the best. 
The Normal College of the City of New York com- 
bines academic instruction with its professional courses 
in such a way as to provide the girls instruction 
of practically the same character as that offered the 
boys in the College of the City of New York. It grants 
the bachelor’s degree in arts as well as in pedagogy, and 
even the advanced degrees. A high school education, 
or its equivalent, is demanded for entrance. The latter ¥ 
is true also for the Chicago Normal School, which won 
renown under the direction of Colonel Francis Parker, 
who was a long time its president.

d. PEDAGOGICAL DEPARTMENTS IN COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES 
The institutions for the training of teachers already 
discussed are primarily for providing the elementary 
and rural schools with a properly prepared teaching 
force. It is true that many of their graduates find their 
way into the secondary schools, and do efficient service 
there, but academically, the normal and city training 
schools are little more than of secondary grade them- 
selves, and are not intended to develop the extended 
scholarship that is a desideratum for the best high school 
work. This fact being recognized, the higher academic 
institutions are attempting quite generally to solve the 
problem of the preparation of the secondary school 
teacher through the establishment of pedagogical de- 
partments, or by offering courses especially adapted to 
the professional needs of the teacher. This move is 
practically one of the last thirty years, not more than 
three or four attempts having been made longer ago 
than that. The first seems to have been in the Univer- 
sity of the City of New York (now New York University) 
in 1832-1833, when for about a year pedagogical courses 
were offered. Brown University next tried the ex- 
periment in 1850, continuing such courses for five 
years, after which they were discontinued. In 1873 
Iowa University established teachers’ courses which 
were open to seniors; and in 1878 opened its College 
of Normal Instruction, primarily for graduates, and 
offered courses in the history of education, national 
systems of education, practical educational topics, school 
economy, and the principles of education. The whole 
was under the direction of Dr. N. S. Fellows, and led to 
the degree of Bachelor of Pedagogics. In 1879 the 
University of Michigan founded a chair of science and 
art of teaching, which has, since its inception, been 
occupied by but two men— Professors W. H. Payne 
and B. A. Hinsdale.
-P-A-G-E-415
    
The Preparation of Teachers 387 
From that time there was a rapid increase in the num- 
ber of higher institutions offering pedagogical instruc- 
tion. In 1884 there were six, the universities of Iowa, 
Michigan, Missouri, Nebraska, Wisconsin, and Johns Hop- 
kins. In 1893 the number was 83; in 1894,174; in 1897, 
220; in 1899, 244; and in 1902, 247. The pedagogical 
courses offered in these institutions vary so greatly, both 
in number and character, as to make any general state- 
ment of them impossible. In some, but a single course is 
maintained ; and this is usually offered by an instructor 
connected with the philosophical or other department. 
In others, several instructors give their whole time to 
the work, a sufficient number of courses being offered 
in the department to make it possible for the student to 
devote the last two years of his course largely to profes- 
sional work, or even to take an advanced degree in it. 
The courses most frequently offered may be summarized 
under four general heads: (a) philosophical, (4) histori- 
cal, (c) courses in organization and administration, and 
(d) courses in special methods; under the first, as variously 
stated, come courses in the philosophy of education; 
principles of education; general pedagogy ; educational 
theory ; educational aims; educational foundations; and 
educational zsthetics : the second comprises, besides the 
general history of education, the history of education 
in special countries, as Grecian, Roman, German, and 
English ; the development of the American school sys- 
tem; the comparative study of national school systems ; 
and the study of educational classics. The courses in 
organization and administration usually have special 
reference to secondary school work, though sometimes 
they are of broader application. Under “methods,” a 
vast number of special courses are offered, though gen- 
erally with direct secondary school applications. Every 
important subject of the high school curriculum is, in 
some institutions, made the subject of study, the courses 
not infrequently being offered by instructors. connected Rep. Com, Ed.

with the various academic departments of the college. 
Besides these courses most frequently offered, others in 
school hygiene, educational psychology, and child study ~ 
are sometimes given by the pedagogical departments, 
though more often by those of psychology. 
On the whole, the pedagogical departments in the 
higher institutions are doing most valuable work in the 
preparation of teachers for the secondary schools. They 
are not as yet so well organized as they should be, and 
furnish very little adequate facility for observation or 
practice work on the part of the students. In some few 
institutions, as at Harvard and Brown, arrangements are 
made with public school systems in the vicinity, that the 
students may have practical experience in school work, 
but such instances are altogether too few. In this re- 
spect, the normal schools, through their practice schools, 
are far in advance of the universities. 
e. TEACHERS’ COLLEGES 
Within this class there are as yet but few institutions, 
though the tendency seems to be for the pedagogical 
departments of the colleges and universities to develop 
into such; and we may expect many more within the 
next decade. It is, moreover, difficult to say just what 
constitutes a teachers’ college. Many of the normal 
schools are officially known as universities, as the two 
older schools in Illinois, and a still larger number, as 
colleges, but these titles have only a historical signifi- 
cance. Among the whole number of institutions for 
the professional training of teachers there are, however, 
ie a half-dozen or so varying greatly among themselves, 
but still in every case doing work of a manifestly higher 
grade than the normal schools as a class, and having a 
» sufficiently distinct organization to warrant treating 
them in a separate class from the normal schools, or 
the university departments of pedagogy. One of these

institutions is an advanced normal school, —the New P. 37s. 
: York State Normal College at Albany,— while the 
tewlothers. are connected with universities. These are 
the Teachers College, connected with Columbia; and 
the schools of pedagogy, and of education, connected, 
respectively, with New York University and the Univer- 
sity of Chicago. Clark University may, perhaps, be 
-mentioned as a sixth, though it has no specially or- 
ganized pedagogical department. It offers, however, 
every facility at its command for the study of advanced 
educational problems, and many valuable contributions 
come from it. 
The New York State Normal College, for nearly a 
half-century of its existence as an institution, varied but 
little from the ordinary type of normal school. But in 
1891 its courses were reorganized and the school put 
upon a wholly professional basis, no academic subjects 
being taught except as features of courses in special 
methods of teaching. A high school diploma, or its 
equivalent, is required for admission. The college offers 
a so-called English course, a classical course, and a kin- 
‘dergarten course, each of two years, and a special course 
~ ‘for school superintendents and college graduates, of one 
year. The degree of Bachelor of Pedagogy is granted. 
The Teachers College at Columbia is the most elab- Columbia, 
orately equipped and fully organized professional school ?: 75% 
for teachers in the country. It was founded as a sepa- 
rate institution in 1888, but has by gradual stages 
been absorbed by Columbia, until now it ranks with the 
schools of law, medicine, and applied science, as one of 
the professional departments of the university. The 
college has magnifigent buildings adjoining the Colum- 
bia campus, maintains the Horace Mann School with all 
grades, from kindergarten to high school, as an observa- 
tion school, besides the Speyer School, an admirably 
equipped elementary school for purposes of practice. 
The college offers a four years’ course, the last two

P. 274. 390 fligher and Special Education 
being largely professional, at the end of which a bache- 
lor’s diploma is awarded. The course is divided into 
special groups of subjects, so arranged as to prepare the ° 
student to be a specialist, either in (a) the elementary 
schools, (4) the kindergarten, (c) any one or more of the 
usual academic subjects in the secondary school curricu- 
lum, (2) domestic science, (¢) domestic art, (/) fine art, 
(g) manual training, (2) music, (7) physical education. 
The master’s and doctor’s diploma, also, are granted for 
graduate work. Furthermore, the relationships are such 
that work in the college is accepted for any of the de- 
grees granted by Columbia University, making it pos- 
sible for a student to take his advanced university 
degree at the same time as his diploma in the college. 
Probably no training school for teachers in the world 
has a finer equipment than the Teachers College, or is 
doing work of a higher grade. Its teaching force num- 
bers about seventy, many of whom are also members of 
the Columbia faculty. 
The School of Pedagogy of New York University was 
established as one of the graduate schools of the univer- 
sity in 1890. Its aim, as stated in its announcement, is 
“to furnish thorough and complete professional training 
for teachers. For this purpose it brings together all that 
bears on pedagogy from the history of education, from 
analytical, experimental, and physiological psychology, 
from the science of medicine, from ethics, from phi- 
losophy, from esthetics, from sociology, from the prin- 
ciples and art of teaching, and from a comparative study 
of the national systems of education. It unifies this 
knowledge into a body of pedagogical doctrine, and | 
points out its application to the practical work of the 
educator.” It offers courses leading both to the mas- 
ter’s and doctor’s degrees in pedagogy, as well as cer- 
tain other courses intended to qualify students for the 
more advanced work. Extension lectures are also 
offered. The rooms occupied by the school are in

the heart of New York City, facing Washington Square, 
and are easily accessible to thousands of teachers, who 
are more and more fully availing themselves of its 
advantages. 
The School of Education of the University of Chi- 
cago is the latest to enter the ranks of teachers’ col- 
leges. It was established in 1901 by the union of the 
Chicago Institute, founded by Mrs. Emmons McCor- 
mick Blaine, with the university. In its organization 
it comprises the College of Education with a faculty 
of twenty-seven, and the University High School and 
elementary school. Courses are offered (a) in arts and 
technology, (4) in special work for kindergartens, ele- 
mentary school teachers, critic teachers, and depart- 
mental supervisors in elementary schools, and (c) in 
special work for secondary school teachers. The de- 
grees of A.B., S.B., Ph.B., and Ed.B. (Bachelor of Edu- 
cation) are given. The school has magnificent quarters 
in a new building adjoining the university campus, con- 
taining full equipment for every branch of its work, 
including the observation schools. 
TEACHERS’ CONTINUATION COURSES 
Although the institutions for the preparation of the 
teachers of various classes enumerated have large num- 
bers of students enrolled, and are annually sending 
quite an army of trained instructors into the schoolroom, 
it is nevertheless true that the great majority of Ameri- 
can teachers enter it entirely lacking in any special 
pedagogical preparation. That this must be true is 
shown by the fact that in 1871 our entire teaching force 
numbered upward of 180,000, while there was an enrol- 
ment of but 10,922 in the training schools. In 1880 
the numbers were 282,644 and 43,077; in 1890, 363,935 
and 64,440; while in 1902 the numbers were 439,596 
and 94,157 —the latter figures including those in the Univ. of Chi.

pedagogical courses in colleges and universities. It is 
plain, then, that since the demand for teachers so far 
outruns the output of the training schools, that some 
methods must be made use of to supply, at least in part, 
the lack of preparation before entering the schoolroom, 
through professional study after the work of teaching 
-has been taken up; and also to furnish an inspiration to 
some form of continuation study on the part of those 
who have had a professional preparation. 
Such work is being carried on by at least three 
agencies. 
a. Teachers’ institutes. 
6. Teachers’ meetings, under the direction of prin- 
cipal or superintendent.

a. TEACHERS’ INSTITUTES 
These are essentially brief, normal sessions, held at 
different times of the year, usually under the direction 
of the county superintendent of schools, or of some 
other school official. They had their origin when the 
normal schools were in their infancy, and when the pro- 
portion of trained teachers was vastly smaller even than 
to-day. They have been in the past a source of great 
good, and, when properly conducted, have not by any 
means outlived their usefulness. The first teachers’ 
institute of which we have any record was held in 
Hartford, Connecticut, in October, 1839, under the direc- 
tion of Henry Barnard, then secretary of the state 
board of education. Twenty-six young men were in 
attendance, and the session lasted for six weeks. No 
others were held within the state for several years. 
New York State held its first institute in 1840. This 
was really the first meeting of teachers under that 
name, since the term “institute” was not used in con- 
nection with the Hartford gathering. Both Massachu-

setts and Rhode Island took up the work in 1845; New 
Hampshire and Vermont in 1846, and Maine a year 
later. 
The following table shows the years, so far as I have 
been able to determine them, of the beginnings of insti- 
tute work in the various states.

The earliest institutions have left few definite records 
of themselves. Attendance was, however, voluntary ; 
and since no public provision had been made for their 
support, the necessary expenses were met by the teach- 
ers themselves. The work was almost entirely academic 
in its character, a condition necessitated by the scarcity 
of schools above the common grade, and the consequent 
ignorance of the teachers, as a class, of anything above 
the common branches. The importance of such volun- 
tary teachers’ meetings was early recognized by the 
states. Massachusetts appropriated money for their sup- 
port as early as 1846, New York, in 1847, and soon 
every state in which they were conducted, was contribut- 
ing to their support. Throughout the South the Pea- 
body fund was in many instances made available. 
The work was undoubtedly disconnected and frag- 
mentary, as indeed was all the school work of the time, 
and is too fully the case with much institute work to- 
day ; yet it was extremely profitable for the teachers, not  
-P-A-G-E-422
    394 Fligher and Special Education 
only from the standpoint of academic instruction, but 
from that of inspiration. The sessions were not gener- 
ally so long as was that of Barnard’s first institute, yet 
somewhat longer than is the average to-day. As time 
went on, and the academic preparation of the teachers 
improved, institutes of the better class have taken on 
more of a professional aspect. It became evident to the 
leaders, that one week, or even two or three, devoted to 
the study of a school subject, amounted to but little; 
while in that time a vast. amount of inspiration could be 
gained, together with not a little insight into the prob- 
lems of school organization and administration and the 
other more particularly pedagogical subjects; and ex- 
cept in instances where a short-sighted county superin- 
tendent makes the institute a cramming institution pure 
and simple, for his teachers’ examination, that class of 
subjects is now made prominent, and educators of the 
highest class are often heard upon the institute platform. 
In Massachusetts the agents of the state board of edu- 
cation devote a considerable part of their time to insti- 
tute work, and in New York State a special institute 
faculty is maintained. In most of the other states, 
members of the state normal school faculties address 
the institutes; in some, this being a part of their regular 
duties. 
The subjects included in the institute programmes cover 
a wide range, no less than 72 titles being given to the 
offerings in the institutes of Massachusetts alone for the 
year 1886-1887. In the printed announcement of 17 
county institutes (all that issued such announcements) 
in Illinois for the summer of 1902, 26 subjects are men- 
tioned, as follows: history, music, and primary work in 12; 
arithmetic and reading in 11; geography, grammar, and 
pedagogy or psychology in 9; English literature, psy- 
chology, and school management in 6; drawing in 4; 
nature study and science in 3; botany, civics, language, 
physics, school decoration, and zodlogy in 2; while agri-
-P-A-G-E-423

culture, biology, bookkeeping, library work, and spelling 
each appeared once. Of those same institutes, four 
had 6 instructors; two had 5; four had 4; and three 
each 3 and 2. Eight out of the 17 had one or more 
lectures by persons outside the regular corps of institute 
instructors. 
Particulars regarding the present organization and 
support of teachers’ institutes are given in Appendix I, 
which is compiled from the recent school laws of the 
various states, together with statements made by the 
state superintendents of public instruction. 
6. TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 
The national and state teachers’ associations are 
touched upon in Chapter XXVIII and need not be men- 
tioned here, unless it be to say that American teachers 
flock together as do those of no other country in the 
world. Especially is this true in the West and Middle 
West, and it augurs well for the earnestness and profés- 
sional spirit of the profession. Within the single state 
of Illinois, more than seven thousand were in attendance 
at the state teachers’ association and four separate meet- 
ings of divisional associations for the year 1902-1903. 
But aside from these great meetings of teachers, ever 
since the office of city superintendent of schools was 
established, there have been held, in connection with 
nearly every particular school system, meetings of the 
corps of teachers under the direction of the superinten- 
dent for purposes of study and discussion. In many 
instances, the superintendent has practically made his 
teaching force in this way, and often made it well, 
for such meetings, when frequently held, constitute what 
is essentially a teachers’ training school. The exact 
character of the meetings depends entirely upon the 
interest and efficiency of that supervising officer. In 
some instances they are mere unprofitable discussions 
 
-P-A-G-E-424
  396 fligher and Special Education 
of the clerical details of administration ; in others, some 
special book of pedagogical import is read and critically 
discussed ; in others, the superintendent lectures; and in 
still others, specialists from outside the local circle oc- 
cupy the time. In correspondence with 36 superintend- 
ents in cities of small and medium size throughout the 
Middle West, it was found that all hold teachers’ meetings 
of some sort at regular intervals: in 3 instances, weekly ; 
in 7, bi-weekly ; in 22, monthly; in 3, bi-monthly; and 
in I, quarterly. Nine superintendents state that special 
meetings for the grade teachers are also held, either under 
their own direction or that of the principals of the ward 
schools. Eleven state that they (the superintendents) 
usually occupy the time either in lecture or reading; 
2, that occasional lectures are’ given by educational ex- 
perts; and 1, that such is regularly the custom. Twenty- 
eight say that the meeting is of such a character that 
the teachers are expected to participate in discussions 
of a pedagogical nature, in a few instances regular 
assignments having been previously made. In but one 
instance is attendance at the meetings tacitly compulsory 
on the part of the teachers, though it is probably virtu- 
ally so in many more. 
Undoubtedly many sins have been committed under 
the sanction of the teachers’ meeting,,but we cannot 
doubt that it is, when properly conducted, an efficient 
means of pedagogical instruction. 
c. TEACHERS’ READING CIRCLES 
These are believed to have had their origin in an 
idea presented in a paper read before the Ohio State 
Teachers’ Association, in 1882. The plan, which closely 
resembled some features of the Chautauqua scheme, met 
with immediate acceptance on the part of the Ohio 
teachers, and a circle was organized the following year,  
-P-A-G-E-425
ee eae ee en ee ee 
The Preparation of Teachers 397 
which in a short time comprised a membership of two 
thousand teachers. 
It was under the auspices of the State Teachers’ Hinsdale (1), 
Association, with the direct management in the hands P-3®& 
of a special committee. The Ohio circle was followed 
in its plan by the teachers in other states, until now 
similar organizations exist in many of the Western 
states. 
Usually the state board of directors selects the books 
to be read, prepares questions for suitable examinations, 
and issues certificates to those who pass the examinations. 
The local circles are conducted by the superintendents 
of schools or some teacher selected because of special 
fitness for the work. Not infrequently, too, educational ‘ 
journals add efficiency to the work, by publishing articles 
having an especial bearing upon the books studied. It ‘ 
is probable that at least fifty thousand teachers through- Zé 
out the Middle West are doing the prescribed work in 
reading circles, with most valuable results. - 
The Certification of Teachers 
  From the early times, wherever any formal recognition Appendix H. 
of the schools was taken or support given to them by the 
civil authorities, it has been the custom to require some 
sort of a certificate of proficiency of the teacher. Even 
in the Dutch schools of New Amsterdam this was done, 
and the difficulties which Van Corler experienced in P. 15. 
securing a license to teach were truly pathetic. The 
exact character of the requirements imposed have, how- 
ever, varied very greatly, both as to quality and quantity. 
In some instances they have been purely religious, or- P.76. 
thodoxy in some special form of religion being the 
prerequisite: in others nationality was the determining 
factor, and in others—and fortunately for the schools 
it was the larger number — academic proficiency was 
the desideratum.
-P-A-G-E-426
ee ee ae 
398 Higher and Special Education 
In Massachusetts, the school ordinance of 1647 de- 
creed that the schoolmaster must be of “discreet con- 
versation, well versed in tongues.” The provisions of 
this act applied also to New Hampshire, at that time 
united with Massachusetts. It was enacted in 1701 
that every grammar school master must be approved by 
the minister of the town and also by the ministers of the 
two adjacent towns. The ministers were, however, not 
permitted to hold the position themselves. By the law 
Pp. 81, 137, 149. of 1712 the schoolmaster was required to secure the 
approbation of the selectmen of the town. A later law 
(1789) requires that masters of schools must be gradu- 
ates of a college or university, though a certificate of 
° proficiency from some learned minister might be taken 
in lieu of this. 
In Connecticut it was decreed in 1714 that “the 
selectmen in every town should examine the teachers as 
to their qualifications.” 
A similar law was in force at this time in New Jersey. 
To just what hardships the early aspirants for teachers’ 
honors were subjected by those early officials, many of 
whom we have every reason to believe could themselves 
neither read nor write, cannot now be said. No doubt 
an uncertainty on this point, on the part of the aspirants 
themselves, tended to lessen the number of unqualified 
teachers ; but beyond this we doubt the efficiency of the 
test. When during the last century state systems of 
schools were established in every instance, the door to 
the schoolroom was guarded by some form of teachers’ 
examination. 
In many states three classes of teachers’ certificates 
are now issued based upon general legislation. 
Ist. County certificates, usually good but for one or 
two years, elementary in their character, and intended 
for teachers in the rural schools. 
2d. State certificates good for a definite period — 
frequently five years—and of a much more advanced 
character than the county certificates.
-P-A-G-E-427
  The Preparation of Teachers 399 
3d. State life certificates, given only after a some- 
what rigid examination inall the common school branches, 
together with some subjects of a higher grade. In 
all three examinations some knowledge of educational 
theory and practice is demanded. There is no exact uni- 
formity among the different states either in the character 
of the examination or in the method of its administration. 
Besides these state and county tests of efficiency, most 
large cities and towns demand special examinations of 
applicants for positions within their schools, but such 
have only a local bearing. 
In many states, though not by any means all, a normal 
school diploma, or a certificate from a college or univer- 
sity is accepted in place of the general teachers’ exami- 
nations. 
Certain particulars regarding the present methods of 
certification of teachers throughout the country are given 
in Appendix H.

CHAPTER XIX 
ART AND MANUAL EDUCATION 
a. ART EDUCATION 
ALTHOUGH since the time of Benjamin Franklin there 
have been earnest advocates of drawing and various 
forms of manual training as school subjects, such can 
hardly be said to have received a respectable hearing on 
the part of the people until so late as 1870. It is true 
that previous to that time there had been established in 
various cities of the country, drawing and art schools of a 
more or less nondescript character, and that there were 
in operation a few creditable institutions ; but the mass 
of the people had not yet been touched, and there was 
probably some justification in the European characteriza- 
tion of us, as an inartistic people. In fact, previous to 
1870 there were but ten institutions in the country giv- 
ing instruction in any department of the fine arts, of 
sufficient promise to be considered by the commis- 
sioner of education in his later reports. Of these, the 
three oldest were in Philadelphia, that in connection with 
the Philadelphia Academy of Fine Arts having given 
free instruction in drawing and modelling in clay since 
1806. The second to open its doors was the Franklin 
Institute of Philadelphia, which offered courses in 
mechanical, architectural, and topographical drawing in 
semi-weekly classes for a small fee. It began the work 
in 1824. The third was a school entirely for women, 
opened by the Philadelphia School of Design in 1847, and 
giving free instruction in drawing and painting, as well as 
modelling in clay. Thenext to open was the night school

CRRA ROE et Nas BL He OR OTERO Ee MS ye eae Pe RS SL PPI ne 
402 Higher and Special Education 
of the Maryland Institite, giving training in elementary 
and mechanical drawing to members of the institute 
only. The day school was not opened until 1860. In 
1852 the Cooper Union in New York City opened its 
women’s courses, and in 1857 its free school of art. 
This institution has been doing a work in popular edu- 
cation in New York City, hardly equalled by any other 
of its character in the country, if indeed in the world. 
It was founded by Peter Cooper, a wealthy merchant of 
the city. The character of the man may be gathered 
from the following extract from his address delivered at 
the dedication of the building which he had given :— 
“Believing that instruction in the science and philosophy of a 
true republican government, formed, as it should be, of the people 
and for the people, in all its operations, is suited to the common 
wants of our nature, and absolutely necessary to preserve and secure 
the rights and liberties of all; that such a government rightly under- 
stood and wisely administered, will most effectually stimulate indus- 
try and afford the best means possible to improve and elevate our 
race, by giving security and value to all forms of human labor; that 
it is on the right understanding and application of this science based 
as it is on the golden rule; that eternal principle of truth and justice 
that unites the individual, the community, the state and the nation 
in one common purpose and interest binding all to do unto others 
as they would that others should do unto them: thus deeply im- 
pressed with the great importance of instruction in this branch of 
science, I have provided that it shall be continually taught, as of 
preéminent importance to all the great interests of mankind.” 
His school has been one of the most enduring monu- 
ments ever erected by man. 
According to its by-laws, the work of the union is as 
follows : — : 
“The trustees shall establish and maintain a school for the 
instruction of respectable females in the arts of designs and such other 
branches of knowledge as in their judgment will tend to the elevation 
and employment of female labor . . . ‘a free reading room in the 
large hall of the third story for the use of the working classes of both 
sexes and their families’ . . . free courses of instruction at night 
in the elementary principles of science and their application to the

RR i! OT SE Sa Re Pee eS gn meen eign CSE cin, | ree ss ne 
Art and Manual Education 403 
practical business of life . . . shall always include chemistry, physics, 
mechanics, and mechanical drawing . . . an annual course of lec- 
tures upon the principles of government and political economy . . « 
as soon as the income of the corporation will warrant, establish, and 
maintain a thorough polytechnic school.” 
All this has been, and is being done. In the free night 
school of art courses are offered in free hand, perspec- 
tive, industrial, architectural, and mechanical drawing, 
drawing from the form, and from the cast, and modelling 
in clay. 
Other institutions for instruction in the fine arts were 
established in the United States as follows, up to the 
year 1870: — 
1856. School of Design of the Ohio Mechanics Insti- | 
tute, Cincinnati. 
1861. The Free School of Design of the Brooklyn 
Art Association. 
1865. Pittsburg School of Design for Women. 
1869. School of Design of the University of Cin- 
cinnati. 
What makes the year 1870 memorable in the art 
annals of our country is the introduction of drawing 
into the public schools of Boston. Attempts had been 
made previous to this time to have the subject taught in 
the schools in other cities ; but they had come to naught, 
or for various reasons been productive of few results. 
In Baltimore, as far back as 1849, drawing was given a 
place in the school programme, but was continued only 
for a brief period. Cleveland, too, tried the experiment 
in the same year, but little resulted from it. Boston 
was, however, fortunate in securing no less an artist and 
organizer than Walter Smith as “art director” for its 
schools, and since in the same year (1870), by state law, 
drawing was made a required study in all towns in 
the state having five thousand and more inhabitants, the 
subject came immediately into prominence. The State   
 
-P-A-G-E-432
  Bibliography. 
Yale Col. p. 245. 404 fligher and Special Education 
Normal Art School was established at Boston in 1873 
as a source of supply for adequately prepared teachers. 
The Centennial Exhibition of 1876 was made the occasion 
of an elaborate exhibit of what had been accomplished, 
and since the people were ready for it, an immediate 
wave of art enthusiasm spread over the country which 
since that time has steadily gained in volume, until now 
no public school system is without its art instruction, 
nor without a competent specialist as director, unless 
prevented by financial reasons. 
In the public high schools of the fifty largest cities of 
the country, where this consideration would have little 
force, no less than 53,234 pupils out of a total of 109,- 
029 are taking courses in drawing, a larger number than 
for any other subject, save Latin, algebra, rhetoric, and 
English literature. Statistics are not at hand for the 
high schools in the smaller cities nor for the elementary 
school systems, but certainly for the latter they would 
far exceed these figures. 
Meanwhile special institutions for art instruction have 
gone on multiplying in the same proportion. Several 
of these are in connection with our great museums of 
fine arts, as the Boston Art Museum, and the Corcoran 
Art Gallery in Washington, while others are maintained 
as departments in colleges and universities. Of the 422 
such institutions in 1901, 47 were offering courses in fine 
arts (this and many of the following facts are taken from 
Frederick), the enrolment in the subjects being a little 
over 5000 out of a total student body of 47,000. Yale 
was the first to establish fine arts instruction, and has 
been a leader in the movement, standing in a class by 
itself to-day in the success with which it deals with the 
problems of the artist as well as with those of the gen- 
eral student body. It is one of two of the larger univer- 
sities, the other being Leland Stanford, which gives a 
degree for work in the department. 
Fine arts instruction has been a matter of gradual
-P-A-G-E-433
  Art and Manual Education 405 
introduction during the last two decades, usually with- 
out any special change in university organization, except 
in the establishment of the new department. It is often 
impossible to say just when it did find place in the cur- 
ricula of particular institutions. As it is at present 
taught, however, the character of the courses present 
four somewhat distinct types. First, we find that of 
lectures merely, upon the history of fine arts and zsthet- 
ics, with little or no technical instruction. Such is the 
nature of the work at Bryn Mawr, Princeton, Chicago, 
and the state universities of Maine, Missouri, and Wis- 
consin. The course at Brown, which is typical of the 
class, is as follows: (1) ancient art, chiefly Greek; (2) Ro- 
man and medieval, including Byzantine; (3) renaissance, 
chiefly Italian; (4) art of seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries; (5) nineteenth century art; (6) theory and 
criticism. A second class, including Wellesley, Harvard, 
and the state universities of Michigan and Indiana, while 
putting much stress upon the lecture side of instruction, 
provide studio courses for those who desire them. Of 
the work at Harvard, Professor Frederick says : — 
“Of all our universities and colleges, Harvard comes the nearest 
to what may be called fine art instruction, of any American university. 
Having no technical nor professional aim in view, the study is really 
cultural: and is made so by a unison of theory and practice.” 
The following are Harvard's courses : (1) principles of 
delineation, color, and (2) principles of design in architec- 
ture, sculpture, and painting, (3) history of Greek art, 
(4) the fine arts of the Middle Ages and the renaissance ; 
also an advanced course in classical archeology. This 
is made possible by the collection of the Fogg Art Mu- 
seum and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. It may be 
said here that it is as impossible to teach fine arts with- 
out examples as to conduct a school of agriculture upon 
a desert island. Many institutions, although putting 
some stress upon art for art’s sake, nevertheless offer

art courses largely because of the bearing they have 
upon architectural and other forms of professional 
instruction. Among such should be classed Columbia, 
Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Leland Stanford, Pennsylvania, 
the United States Military Academy, and the University 
of Illinois, as well as the various schools of technology. 
Many of these institutions have admirably equipped art 
departments, and are doing work of the highest char- 
acter,

From the earliest days of the district school, music, | 
or what passed for it, has had a place in the curriculum. / 
Not that technical instruction was given, for the itiner¢ 
ant singing master with his evening singing school 
looked after that, but “ examination day ” came with reg- 
ularity, and songs for the occasion had to be prepared. 
These were practised industriously and sung with vigor. 
Not until about the middle of the nineteenth century 
did the real pedagogical value of music begin to be 
recognized, and the schools set to work to introduce it 
from that point of view. As kindergartens were intro- 
duced, they did much to popularize the subject, and now 
it is practically universal, taken alike by the musical and 
unmusical. In 1885, when a special study of the teach- 
ing.of music in the public schools was made by the 
Cire. of Inf.r: bureau of education, the following were found to be the 
Bree conditions : — 
Pupils in schools in which musicis not taught 128,738 
Pupils in schools in which music is taught by 
the regular teaching force. 4. 5 + 251,769 
Pupils in schools in which music is taught by 
special teachers only . yea 2ORe 
Pupils in schools in which music is s taught by 
special teachers and regular teachers. 795,314 
As will be seen by the figures, at that time only about 
one-eighth of the pupils were without instruction in
-P-A-G-E-435
  Art and Manual Education 407 
music; and to-day the proportion is much less. Besides 
the public school facilities for musical instruction, pri- 
vate teachers are abundant in every locality, and each 
considerable town has one or more conservatories where 
extended instruction is offered. Many of the colleges 
and universities, too, maintain musical departments; in 
some instances seminaries for women having so empha- 
sized them as to have become little other than conserva- 
tories of music. Singing societies and choral unions 
must not be disregarded as important factors in munici- 
pal education, and too much cannot be said in praise of 
such men as Henry L. Higginson, whose generosity has 
made possible for these many years the Boston Sym- 
phony Orchestra. In the matter of artists’ concerts, we 
are now but little behind the European nations, and in 
the musical productions made possible at the Metro- 
politan Opera House in New York, far in the lead. 
c. Manuat Epucation 
Those forms of education which are primarily in- 
tended to produce in the pupil a dexterity of movement, 
rather than intellectual development of an academic or 
professional nature, have arisen as a result of two dis- 
tinctly different demands on the part of the people. 
The first is largely an economic one, and calls for skilled 
labor. The result has been the various trade schools. 
The second has come from the educational leaders, and 
has called for the various forms of manual instruction, 
not so much because of their vocational, as their educa- 
tional value; and has resulted in the introduction of 
departments of manual instruction of a general nature, 
in our public schools and other educational institutions. 
It is true that neither one of these classes of schools 
disregards the primary aim of the other, for the educa- 
tional value of trades instruction in the purely industrial 
schools is fully recognized, as is the vocational nature of
-P-A-G-E-436
Chapter XVII. 
  408 Higher and Special Education 
much of the manual work in the other class of schools; 
yet that their aims are distinct cannot be denied, nor 
should it be. Schools of the industrial type have been 
touched upon in the chapter on technical education. 
Those of manual instruction for educational ends are a 
later development, and have their raison d’étre in the 
changing social conditions. When the population was 
largely rural, and the boys and girls were factors in the 
household economy, helping with the “chores” and the 
housework, besides doing the many little mechanical jobs 
which arise about the house, the proper motor control 
of the various parts of the body was acquired without 
the necessity of help on the part of the machinery of the 
schools. But with the increase of urban population, and 
the more intricate organization of the affairs of the 
household, the boys and girls were deprived of this 
home education in manual and domestic service to the 
undoubted detriment, not only of the active side of their 
education, but of the purely intellectual as well, for one 
cannot suffer without injury to the other. These facts 
being recognized, the leaders in educational thought cast 
about for some remedy, and in the early ’70’s, soon after 
the first enthusiasm was manifested in the question of 
drawing in the public schools, and perhaps somewhat 
dependent upon it, manual instruction for other than 
purely vocational purposes had its origin. Such work 
seems to have been first offered at the Illinois Indus- 
trial University, now the University of Illinois, in 1871, 
under the direction of N. C. Ricker, now dean of the 
College of Engineering. In that year both wood and 
iron shops were in operation. During the next year 
(1872) similar shops were established by C. M. Wood- 
ward, a leader in manual instruction ever since, at the 
Washington University in St. Louis. Even previous to 
this time, the merits of the so-called “ Russian”? method 
of tool work, formulated by Della Vos in St. Peters- 
burg, had been discussed on this side of the water, yet  
-P-A-G-E-437
  Art and Manual Education 409 
had not been actually introduced. But in 1873 Pro- 
fessor Ricker, during a visit to Europe, made a careful 
study of its methods and results, modified it to meet the 
wants of his department, and put it into practice in 
1875. Specimens of work done under his direction 
were exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition in 1876. 
At the same exhibition an elaborate display of models 
illustrating the method was made by the Russian school, 
and we may perhaps date the real beginning of educa- 
tional manual training from that year. Schoolmen from 
all parts of the country went home from the exhibition 
enthusiastic over the possibility of manual instruction ; 
and, so far as possible, took steps to introduce it into 
their schools. The move, so far as the public schools 
are concerned, has taken on two forms: (1) that of the 
introduction of manual branches into the regular curric- 
ula of the schools, and (2) that of the establishment of 
separate manual training high schools. Where the lat- 
ter is done, the simpler manual branches are taught in 
the grades in connection with the regular work. 
Manual Training in the Grades 
So rapid was the introduction of this feature of educa- 
tional work into the public schools, that in 1889 some 
form of it was in operation in 28 cities and towns in the 
country, in 9 of which it was offered in all the grades. 
In the others it was about evenly distributed over the 
primary and intermediate classes ; and was usually given 
three times a week for an interval of one hour, though 
many variations from this plan were shown. Besides the 
subject of drawing, which was very frequently included 
with the manual work, all gave some form of wood 
work, 21, sewing; 11, cooking; 9, modelling in clay; 
6, paper folding; 5, printing; and 4, work in iron. In 
1901 similar courses were being given in 232 cities of 
over 8000 inhabitants, and in a large number of smaller  
-P-A-G-E-438
  410 fligher and Special Education 
towns. The tendency seems to be to put the courses in 
the later rather than the earlier grades, where they are 
given at all, about six times as many schools having 
them in the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th, as in the first four 
grades. Cooking has also been more generally intro- 
duced. 
Manual Training Schools 
Beginning with the St. Louis Manual Training 
School, which opened in 1880, the number of special 
schools of this character has rapidly increased, being 
18 in 1889, and 153 in 1go1, though the last figure in- 
cludes a considerable number of trades schools, among 
them, 35 for Indians. Of the 100 or so in which the 
vocational element is made subservient to the more 
broadly educational, 25 are elementary in their charac- 
ter; 24 cover both the elementary and secondary fields 
of instruction; 48 are purely secondary; 4 combine 
work of a secondary grade with the higher; 4 do work 
of a collegiate grade only, while 2 cover all grades of 
work from the lowest elementary, through the college. 
Of those giving instruction of a secondary grade only, 
nearly all are public manual training high schools sup- 
ported in every way, as are any other parts of the public 
school system. The move for the establishment of such 
schools was not under way until well into the ’80’s, but 
in 1884 Chicago and Baltimore established them, and 
New York City made provision for manual instruction 
in its city college. The next year (1885) the Central 
Manual Training High School was opened in Philadel- 
phia, and early in 1886 the Cleveland School. Omaha, 
New Orleans, Cincinnati, Denver, New Haven, Louis- 
ville, Brooklyn, Kansas City, and Boston soon followed 
with similar schools, the latter naming its school the 
Mechanics Arts High School. These schools are all of 
one general type, though each retains an individuality  
-P-A-G-E-439
Art and Manual Education 41 
of its own. The entrance requirements are usually the 
same as for the English and classical high schools in 
the same cities, the courses of the same length, and the 
requirements for graduation equivalent. Modern lan- 
guages are taught, though not the ancient; English is 
not neglected, while mathematics is emphasized. The 
physical and chemical sciences receive much attention, 
and the laboratory facilities for teaching them are gen- 
erally better than in the academic high schools. Besides 
the departments for wood and iron working, which are 
primarily, though not exclusively, for the boys, those of 
the domestic arts and sciences, including sewing, dress- 
making, millinery, cooking, and even household sanita- 
tion and esthetics are maintained in the coeducational 
schools. In the manual training high schools and 
manual training departments of the other high schools 
in the fifty largest cities of the country are enrolled 
10,146 students, which is about one-tenth of the total 
number in those schools. Of these 2687 are girls. 
The private secondary schools of manual training do 
not differ materially from the public, except that in 
many instances their offerings are more extensive, com- 
bining the manual instruction with a greater amount of 
art work and even courses for library and business 
training. 
The few schools which combine the secondary grade 
of instruction with the higher are all private institutions. 
Among them are the Lewis Institute, Chicago, the Brad- 
ley Polytechnic Institute, Peoria, Illinois (1896), the 
Lowell Textile School of Lowell, Massachusetts, Drexel 
Institute of Philadelphia (1891); schools of the highest 
order of excellence. 
Of the two institutions of a collegiate grade, one is a 
state institution——-the State Manual Training School 
of North Dakota at Ellendale; the other, the Pennsyl- 
vania Museum School of Industrial Arts. Although the 
former is essentially an institution for instruction in the Appendix E.
-P-A-G-E-440
  4i2 Higher and Special Education 
manual arts, the latter offers them only as a department 
in connection with commercial and other branches. 
Besides these two special institutions of collegiate rank, 
manual training is taught in all the land-grant colleges 
and in many of the other institutions which were dis- 
cussed in Chapter XVII. Courses in domestic science, 
though formerly not included in their curricula, are 
being rapidly introduced, and are now given in the fol- 
lowing: the state universities of Minnesota, Nebraska, 
Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, and Nevada; the agricultural 
colleges of Alabama (colored), Colorado, Connecticut, 
Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Montana, North Caro- 
lina (colored), North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, 
and Utah; the Branch Normal of Arkansas, Hampton 
Institute, and the West Virginia Colored Institute. 
These institutions, together with Pratt Institute, the 
Teachers College(Columbia), the manual training schools, 
wholly or partially of a collegiate grade, and a few 
normal schools, form the source of supply for teachers 
of this branch.

CHAPTER XX 
COMMERCIAL EDUCATION 
Institutions offering courses of training for business 
are of four classes. 
a. Commercial and business schools. 
6. Public high schools. 
c. Endowed secondary schools, usually more or less 
industrial and technical in their nature. 
d. Colleges and universities. 
a. COMMERCIAL AND BUSINESS SCHOOLS 
This class of schools, supporting themselves entirely 
from fees and conducted purely as business ventures, 
were first in the field, having had their origin soon after 
the middle of the nineteenth century. In their incep- 
tion they were very simple institutions, having in many 
instances but one teacher, and as equipment, nothing 
more than a single room, usually in some business 
block, and a few tables and chairs. The course was 
short, of a few months at most, and consisted of pen- 
manship, business arithmetic, and bookkeeping. 
There can be no doubt, however, that such institu- 
tions met a business need ; for they multiplied very rap- 
idly, took on more complete forms of organization, and 
in some instances developed into schools of consider- 
able size, or into systems of affiliated schools situated in 
different cities, but under the same general management. 
The Packard schools and the Bryant and Stratton 
schools are evidences of this tendency to form “chains,”

no less than fifty having been-at one time under the 
latter name. i 
In 1870 the number of private commercial schools in 
the country was 26, with 5824 pupils. In 1875 the num- 
bers were 131, and 26,109, respectively. In 1880, 162, 
and 27,146; in 1890, 263, and 78,982; while in 1901, 
there were 407 such schools with a total enrolment of 
110,031 students, and a teaching force of 2434. The 
greatest variation is found among these institutions. 
Several have but 1 instructor, a considerable number 
but 2, while 26 have between 10 and 19; 6 between 20 
and 29; and 1 upwards of 30; the remainder having 
between 3 and 9 upon the teaching force. As pre- 
requisites to admission, the common branches only are 
demanded. All except a very few schools maintain a 
general commercial course; and all save 75, courses 
in stenography. In addition, a general course in the 
English branches is offered in about one-half the 
schools, while telegraphy is taught in about one- 
fourth. But 36 of the schools offer courses of twelve 
months or over (one 36 and another 30), the average 
length being six months. A great majority hold ses- 
sions in the evening as well as in the daytime. Many 
are elaborately equipped with all the business offices for 
the transaction of commercial business—including bank, 
clearing house, etc. — and the students carry on business 
transactions through the mail with those in other affili- 
ated schools. / Although it cannot be denied that the 
schools of this: class have done valuable work, they can 
hardly be classed as educational institutions in the 
broadest sense, since their primary aim is to turn out 
pupils who are proficient in some particular system of 
bookkeeping or of stenography, rather than to develop 
intellectual power. What they pretend to do, however, 
they in many instances do well, and even an apprentice 
system pure and simple has some place in our economic 
development. )/

Commercial Education 417 
6. CoMMERcIAL EpucaTIon In Pusiic HicH ScHooLs 
Courses for business gained their admission to the 
American high school through the introduction, in 
some instances two or three decades ago, of courses in 
bookkeeping, typewriting, and sometimes stenography, 
offered as electives. In many schools this represents 
precisely the status of business studies to-day. There is, 
however, a widespread move in the direction of better 
organization of the work and the arrangement of definite 
curricula covering three or four years, which shall bring 
about as full an intellectual development as do any of 
the secondary school courses; though utilizing as the 
basis of such a development the purely and allied com- 
mercial branches. Whether this is entirely possible 
remains to be seen; but many cities are struggling with 
the problem, and in so many different ways that if the 
problem is capable of a solution, it will be discovered in 
some one of them. Although it is too early in the move 
to predict results, it seems probable that the best plan 
for commercial education in the high school is through 
the establishment of entirely separate schools for the 
purpose + the plan which has proved so successful in 
the case of manual training. Washington, District of 
Columbia, and New York City are as yet the only ones 
to do so(Washington since 1890, New York since 1900); 
but Chicago has the matter under consideration, and 
will undoubtedly soon take definite action. In Boston 
a two years’ commercial course is given in connection 
with some of the regular high schools. In Pittsburg, the 
course is of but one year. In Omaha, the course is 
spread over four years, no one of which is intensively ¥ 
commercial in its character, and a similar course is pur- James, pp. 676- 
sued in the Central High School of Philadelphia. 
A study of the curricula of public high schools in 
various parts of the country, for the years of 1890 and 
1900, throws an interesting light upon the changes in 
2E 677.

  As may be seen, the full commercial course is given 
in about three times as many of these schools in 1900 
as was the case in 1890. The specific subjects which 
have been especially emphasized are stenography, com- 
mercial geography, commercial law, and business 
practice. f 
The commercial courses in the high schools differ 
from those in the private commercial schools in being 
less technical, and in the introduction of these subjects, 
and in some instances the ethics of business, which tend

to give a broad foundation for the mastery of the funda-

The number of students pursuing commercial branches 
in our public high schools for as many years as figures 
are given for by the commissioner of education is as 
follows: 1893-1894, 15,220; 1894-1895, 25,539; 1895-

c. COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN PRIVATE ENDOWED 
INSTITUTIONS OF SECONDARY GRADE 
There are many institutions of this class, and among

secondary schools in commercial education, such as the 
Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, and the Drexel Institute of | 
Philadelphia. The latter has an especially elaborate Rep. Com. Ed, 
organization and extended course. eer ip 
In all, 867 private academies offer commercial courses, 
with a total enrolment of 15,649 pupils. The courses 
do not vary materially in most instances from those in 
the public high schools. 
Many of the normal schools, too, both public and 
private (seventy-five in all), make provision for commer- 
cial students. 
d. COMMERCIAL EDUCATION IN COLLEGES AND UNI- 
VERSITIES 
The most recent move in commercial education, and 
the most hopeful one, since it aims to produce leaders 
rather than mere journeymen, is that which is just now 
taking place in our higher academic institutions. Our 
commercial and economic development is in the direc- 
tion of great business enterprises, the success or failure 
of which depend upon the good judgment and far-

sightedness of their leaders, not in their expertness as 
bookkeepers. In recognition of this, our colleges and 
universities have set themselves to the task of graduat- 
ing men of power, the basis of whose education is com- 
mercial, rather than classical or technically scientific. 
The move started but little more than a decade ago, and 
gained hardly any momentum until within the last five 
years. Previous to that time commercial branches had 
been taught in the colleges, but the treatment was 
academic rather than professional, and amounted to 
little. 
Univ. of Pa. The University of Pennsylvania was the first higher 
P.250¢/ se7. institution to arrange definite courses of study for stu- 
dents anticipating business careers. Thiswas_made 
possible through-a-gift of $100,000 made by Mr. Joseph 
Wharton, which was devoted to the establishment of a 
schoorof finance and economy in the university, bearing 
the name of the founder. Besides certain mathematical, 
historical, and linguistic studies, the course in the Whar- 
ton school includes, in the freshman year, physical and 
economic geography, practical economic problems, eco- 
nomic literature, and legislative and executive documents. 
In the sophomore year the professional studies are busi- 
ness law, money, and banking, business practice, theory 
and geography of commerce, American and European 
constitutional law, political economy, and legislative or- 
ganization and procedure. The juniors study compara- 
tive politics, modern legislative problems, business 
practice and banking, economic history, sociology with 
field work, English constitutional history, logic, and 
ethics; while the last year of the course comprises 
the history of law and legal concepts, local and mu- 
nicipal institutions, political economy, statistics, public 
finance, transportation, and advanced sociology. 
No other great institution followed the example 
set by Pennsylvania until 1898, when two, both in the 
West, established colleges of commerce. These were 
   
-P-A-G-E-449

the universities of California and of Chicago. In each 
the course is four years. In the former the studies are 
divided into ten groups, viz.: philosophical, legal, politi- 
cal, historical, economic, linguistic, geographical, mathe- 
matical, and technological, covering (a) the materials of 
commerce and (4) transportation. 
At Chicago the prescribed studies for the first two 
years comprise economics and social history, commercial 
geography, civil government, history, modern languages, 
English, and science. In the last two: principles of 
political economy, elements of jurisprudence, constitu- 
tional law of the United States, Europe in the nineteenth 
century, recent American history, and psychology. The 
remainder of the course, amounting to somewhat more 
than one-fourth, is selected from fifty-six special offerings 
which are open for election. 
In 1900 the Amos Tuck School of Administration and 
Finance was opened at Dartmouth College. The course 
of study extends through two years, and is intended to be 
graduate work, though it may be taken in part by sen- 
iors in the college. The subjects covered are modern 
languages, advanced history, advanced economics, law 
and diplomacy, sociology and statistics, administration, 
accounting and auditing, business organization and pro- 
cedure, commerce, transportation, money and banking, 
public finance, corporation and financial insurance, and 
a thesis to be presented by each student. 
At the University of Illinois, what is practically a 
school of commerce was organized in 1902, offering 
courses for business under the following general heads: 
(a) general courses in business training, (4) courses in 
banking, (¢) courses in transportation, (d) courses for 
journalism, (¢) courses ininsurance. In connection with 
these general courses, there are in economics, commerce, 
and industry, thirty-five special offerings: in govern- 
ment, one; in history, six; in law, six; in insurance, 
one; in materials of commerce, five; in mechanical Univ.of Chicago,

These outlines will serve to show the kind of commer- 
cial work that is at present being done in those colleges 
and universities in which it has been most fully organ- 
ized. Several others are, however, offering courses of 
much the same character; in all(1901), a dozen or more 
in addition to those mentioned. Among them are the 
state universities of Michigan, Wisconsin, Louisiana 
(Tulane), Vermont, West Virginia, Nevada, and Wyo- 
ming. . 
It is too early to say just what particular direction the 
development of these schools may take, but there can be 
no doubt of their general efficiency, nor that they are 
bound to play an important part in our business and 
economic development as a nation. 
As yet they have not turned themselves prominently 
in the direction of preparation for journalism, but the 
recent gift of Mr. Joseph Pulitzer of New York to 
Columbia Columbia University for the foundation of a school of 
B. 259. journalistic training, cannot fail to turn public attention | 
in that direction, and we may expect important develop- 
ments within the next few years.

The Education of Women 427 
In Norwich, Connecticut, the morning hours “ from 5 
to 7 A.M.” were given to the girls. Nathan Hale, while 
schoolmaster in New London in 1774, writes in a 
letter :— 
“T have kept during the summer, a morning school between the 
hours of 5 and 7, of about twenty young ladies: for which I have 
received twenty shillings a scholar by the quarter.” 
Toward the end of the eighteenth century many other 
New England towns made similar provisions for the in- 
struction of girls; but that the two sexes were rarely to- 
gether in the same school is to be inferred by a memo- 
randum made by Benjamin Mudge. He says: — 
“Tn all my school days which ended in 1801 I never saw but three 
females in public schools in my life and they were only in the after- 
noon to learn to write.” 
Dorchester had, however, in 1784, inserted the wedge 
which eventually, though only after many years, opened 
the door of the public school to girls. In that year the 
town voted “that such girls as can read the psalter be 
allowed to attend the grammar school from the first day 
of June to the first day of October.” ) Previous to this 
time they had been admitted only to the general annual 
catechising. 
In Portsmouth, New Hampshire, one David McClure 
was employed by the selectmen in 1773 totake care of 
a girls’ school, and makes this interésting note in his 
diary : — 
“Opened school, consisting the first day of about 30 Misses. 
Afterward they increased to 70 and 80; so that I was obliged to 
divide the day between them and one half came in the forenoon and 
the other in the afternoon. They were from 7 to 20 years of age. 
. Lattended to them in reading, writing, arithmetic and geography 
principally. This is, I believe, the only female school (supported 
by the town) in New England, and is a wise and useful institution.” 
In 1789, Boston_established the first of the.so-called 
“ Double-headed”” schools, in which girls were given the Am. Jour. Ed.

same privileges as the boys, though the two sexes were 
taught séparately~-~"They were reading and writing 
schools, with the programmes so arranged that one half- 
day was given up to each subject; the girls taking one, the 
boys the other. These were the common girls’ schools 
in the city until about the time of the girls’ grammar 
school in 1826. 
The eagerness with which the girls availed themselves 
of any educational privilege accorded them was not over- 
looked by private teachers. Toward the latter part of 
the eighteenth century, several private schools. for girls 
were. opened. In New Haven, two. Yale students, during 
the time that college work was suspended in 1779-1780, 
taught each a class of young women for a brief period. 
Jedidiah Morse had a similar school there in 1783. Two 
years later Timothy Dwight, afterward president of 
Yale, opened an academy, to which both sexes were ad- 
mitted, at Greenfield Hill. At Medford, Massachusetts, 
an institution for girls, dignified with the title of “Acad- 
emy,” was opened in 1789, and is said to have been the 
first of its kind in New England. The famous New Eng- 
land academies were by this time being established 
and, although the greater number of them were for 
boys only, (Leicester Academy (1784) and Westford 
Academy were coeducational from the start. Bradford 
Academy, also founded in the Merrimac Valley in 1803, 
originally admitted both sexes; but the girls gradually 
displaced the boys, and for many years now it has been 
one of the best-known schools for girls in the East. In 
its early days the course of study consisted of Morse’s 
Geography, Murray’s Grammar, Pope’s Essay on Man, 
Blair's Rhetoric, composition, embroidery on satin, and 
the study of the Bible. In 1818, the Rev. Joseph Emer- 
son, believing that girls should be better educated, 
opened his academy at Byfield, Massachusetts, and of- 
fered girls an opportunity to study philosophy and other 
branches, which before this had been open only to boys.

The Education of Women 429 
“In 1821, Emma Willard established her female seminary 
at Troy, New York, and in 1837 it was chartered. It 
made no pretensions to collegiate rank. In 1822, 
Catherine Beecher founded a girls’ school at Hartford, 
Connecticut.. One year later the Adams’ Academy was 
established at Derry, New Hampshire, as the first in New 
England, incorporated expressly forthe education of girls. 
Mrs. Willard and Miss Mary Lyon were both teachers 
there, the latter becoming subsequently the distinguished 
founder of Mt. Holyoke Seminary at South Hadley.— 
Abbot Academy, at Andover, Massachusetts, was estab- 
lished in 1829. 
In other parts of the country we find even less wil- 
lingness on the part of schools to admit girls to their 
privileges, than was the case in New England. In the 
South, the wealthier classes provided tutors for the boys, 
and the girls seem in some cases to have shared the 
educational privileges with their brothers, with sometimes 
a visit to Europe to ensure the proper social polish. 
The home..was,-however,.generally..thought.to-be-school 
enough for them,and.the housewifely duties,.a-sufficiently 
extended curriculum; so it is not strange that we find 
that for a considerable part of the eighteenth century 
not_more than one-fourth of the women.who had occa- 
sion to sig sign Tegal docum documents 0 SO, €: 
aking their rk.” 
A few academies for girls had, however, sprung up. 
The Moravians, in connection with their religious estab- 
lishment at Nazareth, Pennsylvania, had ‘naintained a 
school for girls since before 1750, and such was the 
reputation of the school that students were sent to it 
from all the colonies. 
In Philadelphia an academy for girls was started by 
Dr. Rush, and in the same city, the Penn Charter 
School had admitted both sexes. In Lexington, Ken-— 
tucky, a girls’ school was opened very early, and in va- 
rious other parts of the country sporadic attempts were    
 
-P-A-G-E-454
  
430 Higher and Special Education 
made to establish similar institutions, most of which” 
were but ephemeral. Some few, however, continued to 
the present. In 1875, there were 311 separate schools 
for girls of a secondary grade, but the number is some- 
what less to-day, owing to the fact that a considerable 
proportion of them were public high schools which have 
been merged with those for boys, and also to the fact 
that competition with the public schools has caused 
others to close their doors. There are, however, many 
admirable schools for girls scattered throughout the 
country, not a few of which are convent schools belong- 
ing to the Roman Catholics. 
Coeducation in the Common Schools 
(The custom of teaching the sexes together in the pub- 
lic schools of our country.arose. through” convenience 
and for reasons of economy, rather than because of any 
feeling on the part of those in charge, that it was the 
best plan. In its later development it has been Ssip- 
ported by pedagogic principle, but in the beginning that 
was lacking.{ Provision for the education of boys ante- 
dated by nearly two centuries of our history that for 
girls. When need for the latter arose, the plan of ad- 
mitting them to the boys’ school was, in many places, 
the only practicable one; and was followed, since the 
expense of separate establishments was out of the ques- 
tion. Where economic conditions allowed, separate 
schools were maintained, as in Boston and the older 
coast cities, and in some instances remain till to-day. 
When this was done, the girls were the sufferers, so far 
as the character of the work was concerned, for it was 
not of so high a standard in the girls’ schools as in the 
boys’. This is amply shown by the girls’ high schools 
of Boston, which, up to 1878, did not provide sufficiently 
advanced courses to prepare its students for entrance to 
college, although the boys’ schools had done so for more 
 
-P-A-G-E-455

than twenty-five years. In Baltimore, too, in 1900, the 
two girls’ high schools did not complete the ordinary 
college entrance work, though the boys’ schools had 
been sending their students to Johns Hopkins for years. 
Meanwhile the coeducational high schools in the smaller 
cities and towns of the country had been for a genera- 
tion offering the girls the same advantages as the boys. 
But the coeducational experiment, undertaken in the 
older schools in the East through stress of circumstances, 
was made the working plan throughout the West as set- 
tlements were made, through preference. It was fully 
in accord with the democratic ideas on educational mat- 
ters, and has been followed out in nearly all the towns 
there from the beginning. The South has been some- 
what more conservative, and has only gradually adopted 
the system of coeducation; but it is practically in full 
possession of the field there to-day. The move there 
has been made, as indeed it has in the East, somewhat 
largely through the device of dividing a school building 
into the so-called “boy side” and “ girl side” ; that is, by 
making essentially two separate buildings out of one by 
means of a division wall. The next step, when it was 
found that there were no dangerous results from teach- 
ing boys and girls within the same structure, was to de- 
molish the wall, and teach both sexes in the same rooms. 
In some few schools the wall still stands. 
The-—development~of—coeducation in the common 
schools, to its present extent, has been avery gradual 
one, and one not easy to trace in-its-details. It began 
in the first decades of the nineteenth century, and is still 
going on. Within the last decade it has made progress 
in eight different states; the only reason that the num- 
ber is not larger is that-it was already complete in so

school for each sex. In the high school both sexes 
recite together, but study in separate rooms. In New-

seventh grades are in separate schools, though, upon re- 
quest of parents, girls may be sent to the boys’ schools. 
Boys, however, are not admitted to girls’ schools. Penn- 
sylvania: In Philadelphia separate schools are main- 
tained for boys and girls. In six or seven other towns 
in the state a partial separation of the sexes is main- 
tained. Texas and Virginia each has one town in which 
the sexes are separated in high school work. The 
statistics furnished by the commissioner of education 
show that as a result of the century of progress toward 
full educational privileges for women the move is thor- 
ough and complete. No class of schools is closed to 
them, and, so far as the number of individual institu- 
tions is concerned, considerably more exclude men than 
women. In the public elementary schools, in 1892, 55.9 
per cent of the enrolment was of girls: in 1898 it was 
56.5. From these figures we cannot doubt that the girls 
are making the most of their opportunities. - 
Higher Education of Women 
When it had been proved beyond a doubt by the 
academies and_ “seminaries_for women which sprang up 
sex - differences. were not of so much” importance in edu- 
cation as had been supposed, it was not a long step to 
the _establishment-of_institutions_of a still higher grade 
for women. Some of the academies added a year or 
more to their course of study, and took on the more pre- 
tentious name of college or seminary ; while at the same 
time, new institutions made their appearance in consid- 
erable numbers. The colleges for men, too, since the 
public secondary schools demonstrated the entire feasi- 
bility of coeducation, opened their doors to women, and 
we have to-day, as the result of all the moves in the 
direction of the higher education of women, three classes 
of institutions admitting them.

As will be seen from the table, the decade from 1830 
to 1839 saw the beginning of higher education for women 
in our country. Of the twenty-two institutions taking 
their origin before 1850, but two were in the North

Atlantic states, and but two— Mt. Holyoke College at 
South Hadley, Massachusetts, and Rockford College, 
Rockford, Illinois — have arisen to any prominence or 
are to-day doing work of the standard done in the col- 
legesformen. Of these, Rockford College is the oldest, 
having been opened as a seminary in 1849 and char- 
tered asa college in 1892. Its student body is not large. 
Mt. Holyoke owes its origin to(Mary Lyon, a former 
student at Byfield, and a woman of exceptidnal ability. 
Impressed with the importance of the higher education 
of women, she” gave her whole liféto the cause-—many 
years to the creation of a public sentiment in favor of 
her project, and the remainder to the duties of president 
of the institution which she founded. Mt. Holyoke was 
opened as a seminary in 1837, was chartered as a semi- 
nary and a college in 1888, and in 1893 took on a full 
college organization, doing work of the highest class. 
It has a splendid equipment and a large faculty. It 
varies from the other women’s colleges of high grade in 
that the students are required to assist materially with 
the simpler domestic duties connected with the dormi- 
tory life. 
Just previous to the establishment of the school at 
South Hadley, several institutions for women, of some- 
what more than secondary grade, had been established 
in the South. Among these, the Wesleyan Female Col- 
lege at Macon, Georgia, was authorized to grant degrees. 
In all, before 1850, Georgia had four so-called women’s 
colleges, Alabama, Missouri, North Carolina, and Ten- 
nessee, each two, while one each had been founded in 
Maine, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, South Carolina, 
and Texas. The preponderance of such institutions 
throughout the South is noticeable in this list, and is even 
more prominent for the next decade. Out of thirty-nine 
women’s colleges founded between 1850 and 1859, Lyon, 
thirty-two were in that region. But in other parts of the © 
country, coeducation was by this time well under way,

and schools for both sexes were making less necessary 
the establishment of special schools for girls. Of the 
women’s colleges founded in the decade of the ’50’s, 
but one has arisen to full college rank, so far as scholar- 
ship goes, though all are locally influential and doing 
valuable work. This is Elmira College, at Elmira, New 
York, established in 1855. It has been claimed that at 
the time of its organization it was the only real college 
for women in the country, those which preceded it not 
having as yet reached a grade of scholarship which 
would warrant the use of the term. The courses at El- 
mira have, from the first, been nearly the equivalent of 
those in most of the colleges for men. As outlined at 
its opening, the course for the freshman year included 
Cicero’s Ovations, Greek grammar, university algebra, 
descriptive astronomy, critical reading of the English 
poets, ecclesiastical history, botany, physical geography, 
and the philosophy of history, with the courses for the 
others based upon this as a beginning. In the decade 
from 1860 to 1869 came the Civil War, and with it a 
crushing blow to education, especially in the South. 
Although less than one-half as many colleges for women 
date their origin to this period as to the one just preced- 
ing, at least two of the number, Vassar College, at Pough- 
keepsie, and Wells College, at Aurora, both in New York, 
have arisen to first rank. 
The former was founded in 1865 through the gener-- 
osity of Matthew Vassar (g.v.). For the first two years 
the 352 students which were enrolled were unclassified, 
but at the end of that time a complete reorganization had 
been effected and a full course of study arranged. 
The prerequisites for admission to the freshman class at 
Vassar, as announced in the first catalogue (1867-1868), 
compare favorably with those of men’s colleges of the 
time, and have been considerably stiffened since: in 
Latin, they included four books of Cesar, four orations 
of Cicero, and six books of Virgil; Robinson’s University

Algebra to equations of the second degree; rhetoric, and” 
outlines of general history. In addition to these sub- 
jects, which were required of all, entrance to the clas- 
sical course presupposed a knowledge of Greek grammar 
and syntax, together with three books of Xenophon’s 
Anabasis ; for the modern language course, French was 
accepted in place of Greek. 
At its opening the college had two buildings, the main 
hall and the observatory, the latter made famous by its 
director Maria Mitchell. 
Vassar has had but three presidents in its history, and 
these have all been men, although its faculty is made 
up of both sexes, women preponderating. In value of 
buildings and grounds Vassar stands first, and in num- 
ber of students second among the higher women’s col- 
leges of our country; and in the importance of its influence 
upon the general trend of higher education for the past. 
forty years, certainly is unsurpassed by any. 
Of Vassar, President Thomas of Bryn Mawr says : — Ahons P. 336, footnote, 
“To any one familiar with the circumstances, it does not admit 
of discussion that in Vassar we have the legitimate parent of all 
future colleges for women which were to be founded in such rapid 
succession in the next period. It is true that in 1855, the Presby- 
terian synod opened Elmira College in Elmira, N.Y., but it had 
practically no endowment and scarcely any college students. Even 
before 1855, two famous female seminaries were founded and did 
much to create a standard for the education of girls. In 1821 Mrs. 
Emma Willard (g.v.) opened at Troy a female seminary, still exist- 
ing as the Emma Willard school. In 1837 Mary Lyon opened in 
the beautiful valley of the Connecticut, Mt. Holyoke Seminary where 
girls were educated so cheaply that it was almost a free school. This 
institution has had great influence in the higher education of women: 
—~it became in 1893 Mt. Holyoke College. These seminaries have 
often been claimed as the first women’s colleges, but their curriculum 
of study proves conclusively that they had no thought whatever of 
giving women a collegiate education, whereas, the deliberations of the 
board of trustees whom Mr. Vassar associated with himself show 
clearly that it was expressly realized that here for the first time was 
~—being erected a woman’s college as distinct from the seminary or 
academy.”

— Wells College, also founded in the same decade as 
Vassar, and in the same state, opened its doors in 1868 
as Wells Seminary. Two years later it was chartered as 
a college, and has since that time been doing work of a 
high grade. For many years the number of students was 
limited to seventy-five ; but of late that number has been 
considerably exceeded, though it has never been large. 
Its presidents have all been men, though women have 
been in a majority on the faculty. 
— Among the 21 women’s colleges founded in the dec- 
ade of 1870 to 1879 we have 3 which have arisen 
to the highest collegiate rank. Mills College, in Cali- 
fornia, and Smith and Wellesley colleges, both in 
Massachusetts. The first of these was opened as a 
seminary in 1871, and chartered as the only woman’s 
college in the states west of the Rocky Mountains. Al- 
though it maintains a large preparatory department, less 
than 50 college students are in registration; full evi- 
dence that in the Western part of the country coedu- 
cational institutions are looked upon as meeting the 
demands of higher education. The faculty at Mills 
College includes both sexes. 
—Both Smith and Wellesley colleges opened their doors 
in 1875. They are within a little more than 100 miles 
of one another; yet each has risen to the very highest 
rank among colleges for women. The two combined 
had, in 1902, considerably more than one-third of the 
students registered in the collegiate departments of the 
13 institutions ranked by the United States Commis- 
sioner of Education as first class. Henry F. Durant 
founded Wellesley (at Wellesley, Massachusetts) as “a 
college for the glory of God, by the education and cul- 
ture of women.” For the first five years a preparatory 
department was maintained; but since 1880 only colle- 
giate courses have been offered. The college has a 
beautiful campus of more than 400 acres, including a lake 
for boating, and every facility is provided for outdoor

games and recreations. Its main building is a large and 
imposing structure, containing, besides lecture rooms, liv- 
ing accommodations for 250 students. Besides this are 
a chapel, an observatory, a chemical laboratory, an 
art building, a music building, and 1o residence halls. 
The presidents have all been women. Smith College, 
at Northampton, Massachusetts, was founded by a 
woman, Sophia Smith, to provide “means and facili- 
ties for education equal to those which are afforded in 
our colleges for young men.” It has had but one presi- 
dent, and that a man. Its campus is not large (40 
acres), but well supplied with buildings, including 2 
lecture halls, a gymnasium, a general science building, 
a chemical laboratory, an observatory, a conservatory, a 
music building, and 13 residence halls, with accommoda- 
tions for 500 students. 
Although the decade from 1880 to 1889 saw the estab- 
lishment of twelve higher institutions for women in our 
country, but two of these — Bryn Mawr College, and the 
Woman’s College of Baltimore —are placed in the first 
class by the Commissioner of Education. The former of 
these is situated at Bryn Mawr, in Pennsylvania, a few 
miles from Philadelphia, and opened its doors to students 
in 1885. It was founded by Joseph W. Taylor, with the 
expressed purpose of providing “an institution of learn- 
ing for the advanced education of women, which should 
afford them all the advantages of a college education 
which are so fully offered to young men.” This, Bryn 
Mawr has done to an extent perhaps unequalled by the 
other women’s colleges. Its productive funds are larger 
than those of any of the others, and its equipment, espe- 
cially along scientific lines, is unexcelled. Although its 
undergraduate courses are of a high order, its graduate 
work is particularly well organized, and a larger number 
of students are pursuing advanced work there than in 
all the other separate colleges for women, of first rank, 
taken together. Bryn Mawr has had but two presidents, 
bee
-P-A-G-E-464

the first a man, while the present incumbent of the 
office isa woman. No preparatory department has ever 
been maintained. The Woman’s College of Baltimore, 
founded in 1888, is a Methodist institution, in its early 
years maintaining a large preparatory department which 
in 1891 became the Girls’ Latin School of Baltimore. 
Since that time only work of a collegiate grade has been 
carried on in the college. The institution has had but 
two presidents, both of whom have been men. 
The last decade_of the nineteenth century saw the 
establishment of seventeen separate-women’s colleges, 
only one of which, the Randolf-Macon Woman’s College 
at Lynchburg, Virginia, opened in 1893, has attained 
highest rank. It is a denominational institution, sup- 
ported by the Methodists. 
6. Women’s COLLEGES AFFILIATED WITH UNIVERSITIES 
FOR MEN 
The great-strides in the direction of the higher educa- 
tion of women made during the last _half-century, could 
not be ignored by the older colleges for men. Through- 
out the West they have accommodated themselves to the 
movement by opening their doors fully to both sexes, 
and becoming generally coeducational. This plan is not 
without its followers in the East and South, yet there, 
conservatism in matters of educational organization is 
strong, and in several of the older universities a com- 
promise has been reached by the establishment of col- 
leges for women under the same board of control as 
those for the men, and usually with the same faculties, 
but in which the women are separately instructed. There 
is considerable diversity in the detail of organization and 
affiliation among such colleges, yet each is an integral 
part of the organization with which it is affiliated. Five 
such women’s departments are in operation: three in  
-P-A-G-E-465
  
The Education of Women 441 
the Eastern states, and one each in the North Central 
and South Central divisions. 
The H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College for 
Women, affiliated with Tulane University, New Or- 
leans, Louisiana, was the first of the kind to be estab- 
lished, and was opened in 1886. Although the South 
had been active in the foundation of separate seminaries, 
as has already been shown, no one of them had attained 
high rank, and with the sentiment not strong for coedu- 
cation, the plan of an affiliated college was tried as the 
most favorable means of providing full collegiate instruc- 
tion for women. The buildings used by the college are 
in another part of the city from those of Tulane Uni- 
versity. The same trustees officiate for both institu- 
tions, though the productive funds are in part, separate. 
The president and faculty are also distinct. The gradu- 
ate department of the university has been open to the 
students of the college without restriction since 1890. 
The College for Women at Western Reserve Univer: 
sity, Cleveland, Ohio, was established in 1888. From 
1872 up to that date women had been enrolled as stu- 
dents in the university, though without formal authori- 
zation; but in that year, through action of Adelbert 
College, the undergraduate department, they were ex- 
cluded. The university, however, immediately made 
provision for them through the establishment of the 
woman’s college. The latter has separate buildings, 
though in immediate proximity to the university cam- 
pus, and a separate faculty. The university graduate 
department is fully open to the women of the college. 
and the degrees are conferred by the university. Cer- 
tain of the laboratories of the men’s college are open to 
the undergraduates of the woman’s college. 
Barnard College, the woman’s college of Columbia ¢ 
University, was founded in 1889, and is in reality an 
independent corporation, so far as maintenance is con- 
cerned, though academically under the control of Co- & ee

lumbia University. Since 1900 it has borne the same 
relation to it as an undergraduate college for women, as 
does Columbia College, the undergraduate college for 
men. The requirements for admission and standard of 
scholarship are the same for both. 
~~ The greater part of the undergraduate instruction is 
carried on in the Barnard College buildings, though 
some of the senior courses are taken in Columbia in 
the same classes with the men. After 1904 the latter 
practice will be discontinued, except for courses in the 
teachers’ college. All degrees are conferred by the uni- 
versity. Since the graduate school of the university is 
open to women, Barnard offers no graduate courses. 
Brown Univ. ~ At Woman’s College, Brown University, Providence, 
259 2? 32. Rhode Island, instruction was informally begun in 1892, 
and fully organized as a college, under the direction of 
the university trustees in 1897. An advisory council 
for women was established to aid the president of the 
university and dean of the college in matters of admin- 
istration. The entrance requirements and courses are 
the same for the women in the college as for the men 
students, and the same degrees are conferred by the 
university. Undergraduate instruction is given the two 
sexes in separate classes, though in the graduate course 
both are together. The faculty of the woman’s college 
is made up entirely of members of the university faculty. 
The college occupies a separate building — Pembroke 
Hall— several blocks from the Brown campus. 
Harvard Col. Radcliffe College, the affiliated woman’s college of 
Pp. 225 ef seg. Harvard University, was started as a separate woman’s 
college in 1879 by the Society for Collegiate Instruction, 
though not chartered with power to confer degrees until 
1894. It may, perhaps, with justice, however, be con- 
sidered the first of the affiliated colleges for women, 
since it was brought into existence by the efforts of a 
number of members of the Harvard faculty. For many 
years, though known as the “ Harvard Annex,” it had  
-P-A-G-E-467
  
The Education of Women 443 
no official connection with the university. Its board of 
trustees and financial management are separate from 
those of Harvard, though its faculty is entirely composed 
of Harvard instructors. The college confers its own 
undergraduate degrees and offers graduate courses lead- 
ing to the A.M.; but since Harvard does not confer 
degrees upon women, no Ph.D. degrees are open to 
Radcliffe students. Since 1893 Harvard has admitted 
women to its graduate courses, so such students may 
pursue advanced work without any hope of academic 
recognition. The Radcliffe buildings are not upon the 
Harvard campus, though at no great distance from it. 
Besides these five officially affiliated colleges for 
women, at least two other colleges and universities are 
attempting to solve the problem of woman’s education 
by other methods than those of full coeducational privi- 
leges. In both the change has been from coeducation 
to the present plan. The first of these, Colby College, 
at Waterville, Maine, in 1890, instituted the plan of 
teaching the women in separate classes from the men, 
and of debarring them from certain student honors. 
The complete separation which was at first planned did 
not prove practicable; and from the beginning of the 
sophomore year the two sexes are together in all elective 
work. From 1871 till 1890 Colby had been fully coedu- Colby Col. 
P- 273+ 
cational. The other attempt to modify the plan of coed--— 
ucation was instituted at the University of Chicago in 
1902. This institution had admitted both sexes on a 
coeducational basis since its foundation, but the plan, 
not proving satisfactory to all, so-called “segregation” 
of the sexes was instituted. Under it the two sexes are 
taught separately, though by the same instructors, for 
the first two years of the course. Separate buildings 
are provided for the men and women of the “junior col- 
lege,” each with its quadrangle; and, academically, the 
two sexes are not brought into contact with one another 
in that college. Much objection has been raised to the Univ. of Chicaga, 
P. 278. 
 
-P-A-G-E-468
  444 Higher and Special Education 
plan by devotees of coeducation, but it cannot be denied 
that it has some good features. 
During the half-century and more since separate col- 
leges for women were first established in this country, 
the rapid increase in the number of students enrolled, 
has amply proved that the nation was ready for them. 
Although not equalling in number the women enrolled 
in coeducational institutions, they form, nevertheless, 
quite an army of educated womanhood. 
The reports of the United States Commissioner of 
Education gives us the following figures for the women’s 
colleges since 1875. The statistics for students do not 
include the preparatory departments, which in many 
instances were very large.

As is shown by the table, the number of institutions 
classified by the commissioner as of collegiate rank, has 
decreased more than one-third in the twenty-five years, 
while the student body has increased about the same 
amount in the same time. The decrease in schools is 
due to two causes: first, that the method of classification 
has altered within the period covered, and a consider- 
able number which were at its beginning placed with 
the colleges are now included with the secondary 
schools; and second, many which were really little more 
than secondary schools have been forced, through com-  
-P-A-G-E-469
  The Education of Women 445 
petition with the public high school, to close their doors. 
The table is on the whole extremely encouraging, for 
the number of schools is not as important a matter as 
is the quality. One-third of the entire number of 
students within the 132 schools are registered in the 
dozen or more of undoubted college rank, while 
twenty-four years ago scarcely one-twentieth were in 
such institutions. 
A noticeable fact in the development of the separate 
college or resin Wis EET to mae th the courses 
within them as nearly as possiblé like those of the 
colleges for men. In their incéption-they-had certain 
characteristics which distinctly characterized them as 
women’s colleges; music and art were prominent in 
their curricula, and there were evident attempts to 
modify the intellectual training then in operation in the 
colleges for men. Such attempts have gradually been 
given up in the best women’s colleges — whether wisely 
or not, I should not wish to say. Another gradual 
movement has been the elimination of the preparatory 
departments, and the cutting down of the number of 
special students, which formed a large part of the early 
enrolment. In 1870, 19.6 per cent of the students at 
Vassar were enrolled as specials, to 3.9 per cent in 1898. 
Smith and Bryn Mawr do not admit them at all. 
c. WoMEN IN CoEDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS 
Coeducation in higher institutions of learning is a 
Western product, and although it crossed the Atieghanies 
and is the practice in many institutions in n the East, it 
in the West that it is practically in full possession of the 
field’ Oberlin ae Institute — since 1850, Ober-

another followed its example, and this time it was 
within the same state; Antioch College, under the presi- 
dency of no less renowned an educator than Horace 
Mann, who had waged such a battle for the public 
schools in Massachusetts. na influence of such a man 
gave the movement for Coeducation a great impetus, 
and many other colleges and universities soon followed 
the example. The state universities which were being 
founded throughout the West were the leaders, and 
almost without exception those established since 1862, 
when the Morrill Bill was enacted, have admitted both 
sexes on equal terms. Even before that time, in 1886, 
the Staté University of Iowa had done so. The follow- 
ing table gives the dates of foundation of each of the

The state universities of Virginia, Georgia, and Louisi- 
ana are still closed to women. The influence of the 
state universities in the West and South was so great, 
that as other colleges were established throughout the 
region upon private foundation, they were in nearly 
every instance coeducational; so that to-day the college 
for men alone is the exception. 
In the East, Cornell was the pioneer coeducational 
institution, and although its influence upon the others 
has been great, Eastern conservatism has stood in the
-P-A-G-E-472

way of a large following there. The following table 
shows, for the geographical divisions made use of by the 
commissioner of education, the number of higher insti- 
tutions, other than those for women, which are for men 
alone and are coeducational : — |

As is shown by the table, 146 of the entire 470 col- 
leges admit men only, or 31 per cent. If we deduct the 
64 Roman Catholic institutions included, all of which 
are for men only, we find that of the other —and they 
are those generally patronized by the Protestants who 
form the bulk of our population—pbut 20 per cent 
are non-coeducational. 
In the proportion of coeducational institutions there 
has been a marked change, as might be expected, 
the percentage in 1870 being 30.7 of the whole number. 
In 1880 it was 51.3; in 1890, 65.5 and in 1902, 72 per 
cent; in each case with the Roman Catholic colleges 
included. | 
Although the increase in the proportion of coeduca- 
tional institutions has been very rapid, a little more than 
doubling in the thirty years, that in the number of women 
students in attendance has been much more so, as is 
shown by the following table :—_

The Education of Women 449 
Here we have shown a growth of from 3044 to 21,151 
in undergraduate women enrolled in the coeducational 
colleges in twenty-five years —an increase of consider- 
able more than six times. 
By reference to the table showing the entire enrol- ~~ 
ment of these institutions — both male and female — 
it may be seen that this increase is twice as great for 
the women students as for those of both sexes, the lat- 
ter having increased only about three times (1875, 
26,352; 1901, 81,084). Another comparison is also of 
interest —that between the increase of women students 
in the coeducational institutions and women students in 
separate colleges. The former, as has been stated, has 
increased more than six times, while the latter has grown Table, p. 444. 
only from 9572 to 16,554, or less than doubled in the 
twenty-five years. 
This fact would seem to be an expression of a prefer- 
ence on the part of women for the coeducational plan of 
instruction; though not necessarily so, since by far the 
greater proportion of coeducational institutions, notably 
the state universities, have no charge for tuition. The 
showing may be one of economic necessity rather than 
of personal preference. 
Although the plan of coeducation in colleges and uni- 
versities has, in most instances, fulfilled the highest ex- 
pectation of its promoters, it cannot be denied that there 
is a feeling of uncertainty in some quarters as to its ulti- 
mate results. Although little dissatisfaction has been Univ. of 
expressed by the students of either sex, the governing Chicago P. 443. 
bodies of some institutions seem fearful as to its pos- Colby Col. 
sible outcome. The intellectual equality of woman is not Ee 
questioned; but the disproportionate increase in the 
number of women students points to a time when the 
student body may be over feminized. Already, in a 
number of colleges, women outnumber the men, and in 
at least two (Northwestern University, which has limited 
the number of women students to the capacity of its 
2G  
-P-A-G-E-474
  P. 443 450 fligher and Special Education 
~ dormitories, and Leland Stanford, which has arbitrarily 
limited them to five hundred) steps have been taken to 
prevent any disproportion of women students. Theoreti- 
cally, the same instruction for both sexes is right, only 
if the aim of education is identical for the two, ze. if 
they are to be competitors in the same kinds of work. 
Otherwise, some form of specialization is demanded. 
In the larger coeducational institutions, where a wide 
choice of electives is offered, this specialization is, in 
effect, being brought about through selection of courses, 
some of which are largely taken by women, while others 
are the choice of the men. This is as it should be, and 
can be depended upon in the end to solve the question 
of what instruction is best adapted to women more 
wisely than could any prescribed courses theoretically 
formulated in special institutions for the single sex. 
Graduate Instruction for Women 
~ In all the fully coeducational institutions, and in the 
affiliated colleges, with the ‘exception of that at Har- 
vard, all the” privileges. _of graduate instruction are as 
fully. open to women as to men. Moreover, of the great 
universities-for men which do not admit women to their 
undergraduate courses, but two (Princeton and Johns 
Hopkins) still have their graduate schools closed to 
them. In addition, they have access, of course, to 
what graduate instruction is offered in the special col- 
leges for women; so, as far as the number of institu- 
tions goes, they are considerably better off than their 
brothers. That they are availing themselves-of their 
opportunities in rapidly increasing numbers is shown by 
the tables upon pages 444 and 448. 
The figures upon the former table should probably 
carry but little weight, showing, as they do, considerable 
numbers of graduate students in 1880 and 1885, since 
to-day even, very few of the separate colleges for women
-P-A-G-E-475
The Education of Women 451 
are in a position to offer work of a strictly university 
grade, and none other should be classed as graduate — 
and it is doubtful if any were, two decades ago. The 
figures upon page 448, however, are interesting. A 
comparison of them with those upon page 296, which 
give the total graduate enrolment in coeducational col- 
leges and those for men, shows that in 1890 women 
made up about one-eighth of the total number; in 1895, 
about one-sixth; and in 1901, roughly, one-fourth. Ap- 
proximately, one-tenth of the Doctorates of Philosophy, 
conferred by our higher institutions within the last four 
years, have been upon women. 
Regarding graduate scholarships and fellowships for 
women, Miss Thomas says: — 
“In 1899 there were open to women 319 scholarships varying in 
value from $100 to $400 (50 of them exclusively for women); 81 
resident fellowships of the value of $400 or over (18 of these exclu- 
sively for women) ; 24 foreign fellowships of the value of $500 and 
upwards (12 of these exclusively for women).” 
The Professional Education of Women 
With the battle for the higher education of women, 
won in the academic institutions, the professional schools 
have very generally welcomed them, and to-day nearly 
all are coeducational. In medicine there was a strong 
prejudice against such action to be overcome, and four. 
or five women’s medical schools were organized, which 
contain about one-third of the women medical students 
in the country. Other than these, there exist no pro- 
fessional schools for women only. 
The following table shows the enrolment of women 
in the professional schools of the country as far back 
as records are available: —

Previous to 1890 very few women were pursuing pro- 
fessional courses. Except in the training schools for 
nurses, the numerical increase in enrolment has not 
been very great; not so great, in fact, as to lead us to be- 
lieve that woman is to be, at least in the near future, an 3 
important factor in the learned professions. In medi- 
cine there were 400 more women students enrolled in 
1897 than five years later; in law there has been an 
increase of but 34 students in the last five years; in den- 
tistry, no change; and in pharmacy, an increase of 75. 
In fact, in the four professions of medicine, law, dentis- 
try, and pharmacy, there has been an actual decrease 
of 274 in enrolment since 1897. Meanwhile, women 
enrolled in academic institutions have increased 5892 in 
number. We can hardly interpret these facts in any 
other light than that the learned professions offer but 
few attractions to women. 
The following table summarizes the statistics of the 
education of women in all classes of institutions in our 
Rep. Com. Ed. country for the years 1891-1892 and 1901-1902: —

  CHAPTER XXII 
EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO AND OF THE INDIAN

goes back no farther than the Civil War. “Previous _ to 
that time in the South the teaching of the blacks, whether 
they be slaves or free, was forbidden by law, and in some 
states mad€ an offence for which the pupil might be 
fined and whipped, at the discretion of the court, and the 
teacher be ee or imprisoned. In the North no such 
penalty. swas-imposed, Dut since no special schools were

without educational advantages. It is true that both in 
the South and North negroes occasionally were taught 
the rudiments-of-learning in the’ so-called‘ clandestine 
schools”; still’such instances weré raré, and cannot be 
said to qualify the general statement that in-ante Vellum 
days, the negroes were uneducated. When, however, 
they were given full rights as citizens, the problem of

solved as rapidly as social and economic con

  “ The first move of any magnitude was made through the 
Freedmai’s-Bureau, éstablished~by act _of- Congress | in 
1865. General O. O. Howard was the first commissioner 
of fhe bureau, and under his direction a work of immense 
magnitude began. At the end of five years, when the 
bureau was discontinued, the report showed that 4239 
schools for colored-pupils had been-established through-

established, and in 1879, 61 intermediate or grammar 
schools for blacks were in operation, and no less than 
74 high and normal schools, the latter with an enrol- 
ment of 8174 students. The freedmen themselves con- 
tributed about one-fifth of the expense of these higher = ' 
ols: “The rémaiiider of the funds ca e from the Fed- 
[ governitient or-from”private=bequ in the North.” 
Amiong the latter, and they have been een many, that of 
body, wn as ‘the Pe ‘Peabody Func , has been 
productive of t the ost good, Tt consisted of $9, 000,000, 
one-half given in 1867 and the remainder in 1869, which 
was placed in the hands of trustees with the instruction 
that “the income thereof shall be applied in your discre- 
tion for the promotion and encouragement of intellectual, 
moral or industrial education of the young of the more 
destitute portions of the southern and southwestern 
states of our Union; my purpose being that the benefits 
intended shall be distributed among the entire popula- 
tion without other distinction than that of their needs 
and the opportunities of usefulness to them.” The fund 
has always been well invested, and under the trusteeship 
of leading educators of our country. Up to the present 
time it has made available for use, nearly $3,000,000, 
which, with the exception of a comparatively small 
amount devoted to the maintenance of higher insti- 
tutions of learning -in various states, has been turned 
over to the most needy public schools throughout 
the entire South. Besides the Peabody Fund are two > 
others, both due to the generosity of Northern citizens: 
the Slater Fund of $1,000,000, given by Mr. John 
Fox Slater in 1882, administered through a board of 
. trustees, as is the Peabody Fund, and devoted largely to

the promotion of industrial education; and the “Daniel 
Hand Educational Fund for Colored People” of $1,000,- 
894.25, given by Mr. Daniel Hand of Guilford, Connec- 
ticut, in 1888. The American Missionary Association is 
made the custodian of the latter fund, which is devoted 
to purposes of general education throughout the South. 
Aided by these great benefactions and a multitude of 
smaller ones, the South is doing its best to solve the 
problem of the education of its nearly 3,000,000 colored ‘ 
children of school age, and at the same time to pro- 
vide higher institutions of learning for those who wish to 
carry their studies farther. 
It is doing so almost entirely through separate schools, 
s and_blacks.So far as elementary education 
Miller, p. 749. \is c concerned, in no one of the Southern states a are mixed    
Northern. states colored pupils are admitted to all the 
public schools. Although this duplication of schools for 
the two races involves extra expense, it is the avowed 
policy of the South, and one which the white citizens gen- 
erously support by an extra heavy taxation; for in no 
one of the sixteen former slave states is the cost of negro 
schools met by the taxation of the freedmen, themselves. 
In those states the cost of such schools, with the per 
capita expense of educating the negro children, is shown 
by the following table for certain years :—

Education of the Indian and the Negro 457 
In all, it is estimated that the South has expended 
about $121,000,000 upon the education of the negro 
since the war; a sum sufficiently large to prove conclu- 
sively that the problem of negro education is not being 
neglected there, and also to make the contributions from 
the North seem not at all excessive. 
Although by far the greater amount of the sum has 
been spent upon the common schools, since the popula- 
tion of the South is so largely rural, yet in the cities, 
colored high schools are maintained in large numbers. 
In 1880 there were 36 such schools, with 5237 pupils; 
in 1890 the number was 53, with 11,480 pupils; while in 
1901 there were 100, with 12,202 pupils enrolled. The 
courses of study in these schools compare favorably 
with those in the schools for the white pupils in the 
same cities. The teachers are mostly colored, though 
reasonably well prepared, through the normal schools 
which exist in considerable numbers throughout the 
South. t 
Normal Schools 
Although the negro has demonstrated over and over 
again his capability for advanced academic education, it 
was early seen “that the great hope lay along the lines 
of indu trial and vocational training, and as a result, in- 
, oF Normal schools offering, besides the 
intended for teachers, many of an indwStrial 
character, were early established. In 1877 there’ were 
27~-suchinstitutions, with an enrolment of 3785; in 
1880 the numbers were 44 and 7408; in 1899, 41 and 
7642, and in the year 1901 there were 793 students in 
the graduating classes of such schools. Among schools 
of this class, the Hampton Normal and Industrial Insti- 
tute at Hampton, Virginia, is perhaps the best known. 
Of its enrolment, about one-eighth are Indians. It 
was chartered in 1870, in 1872 was given one-third of 
Virginia’s share of the Morrill grant, and has since been

supported largely by public bequest, receiving consider- 
able financial aid from the American Missionary Asso- 
ciation and Peabody Fund. Besides the normal courses, 
it offers others in carpentry, harness-making, shoe- 
making, house-painting, printing, tailoring, plumbing, 
and the trades of the blacksmith, the tinsmith, the 
wheelright, and the machinist. 
A descendant of the Hampton Institute is that at 
‘Tuskegee, Alabama, which has been made famous by 
its president, Booker T. Washington, who has perhaps 
done more for negro education than has any other man 
of his race. It was opened in 1881 with 1 teacher and 
30 students; it has now a faculty of 44 (all colored) and 
an enrolment of more than 1200 students. Besides 
academic instruction, courses are given in twenty-six 
different industries. Its large number of buildings were 
nearly all erected by the students themselves. On the 
whole, the Tuskegee institute probably represents the 
highest type of efficiency in schools for the colored race. 
Higher Institutions 
The colored race is not wanting in colleges and _uni- 
versities: With a few ex cl ns they are all denomina- 
in their. ‘Support, and in many instances have large 
numbers of students doing secondary and even primary 
work; yet in an important manner they are holding out 
to the colored youth the possibility of higher academic 
education. The leading institutions of the class, together

In these institutions and others of the class there 
were, in 1902, 1600 students pursuing classical courses,

courses for business. 
In the matter of entrance requirements and courses

Professional Education 
In those professions which require a definite certifica- 
tion as a prerequisite to practice (medicine and law) 
the number of negroes is comparatively small. \/ Nor 
can it be said that the colored man is taking the place 
in those professions that he might be expected to take. 
The reasons for this are, however, largely social, 
Thé-white-; population does.not.care to employ him, 
and this is largely true of persons of his own race, the 
feeling séémingly being prevalent that white service is 
more éfficient. The ‘professional training of thé’colored 
physicians and lawyers has been largely in the regular 
schools which are open to both races; though a few pro- 
fessional schools, for colored Peer only, are main- 
tained. A considerable number of the colleges support 
theological departments, providing the colored people 
with educated ministers, while the normal schools are 
responsible for the large numbers in the teaching 
profession.   The Education of Negro Women 
Practically all the educational advantages are open 
equally to negroes of both sexes. This is fully true for 
the elementary, secondary, and normal schools, whilé-but 
two of~the-higher-institutions aré closed to women. In 
the public elementary schools the girls slightly outnum- 
ber the boys. In the secondary schools, including the 
normals, this is also true, though not in purely academic 
subjects. The normal courses, and those in sewing, 
laundering, and general housekeeping, are the ones 
most fully patronized by them. In the higher academic 
institutions the women.are-not_found in large numbers, 
but 170 having been ‘graduated from those wholly for 
colored students up to 1898. The proportion is, how- 
ever, rapidly increasing. Up to the same year 82

6. InpIAN EpDUcATION 
Although many crimes may be charged up against the 
white settler in America on the score of his treatment 
of the Indian, that of a neglect of his intellectual and 
spiritual welfare, at least in the earlier colonial days, is 
not one of them.- The very first school planned in the 
colonies — the projected Henrico School of 1618, which 
came~to~naught™through™ the “Indian “himself — was 
for “the training up of the children of those infidels, 
in’ true Teligion, moral virtue and civility, and for other 
godliness”; and the stories of the hardship of Marquette 
and~his-eompanions, of John Eliot, the Indian apostle, 
of Sergeant and of Wheelock are sufficient proof of 
the sincerity of the early attempts in that direction. 
In fact the history of colonial times is full of evidences 
that our forefathers felt a deep interest in the spiritual, 
if not in the intellectual, welfare of the aborigines; and 
showed that interest in the establishment of missionary 
schools, as well as through making special provision for 
the admission of Indian children to many of the regu- 
larly established public schools. It was.not, however, 
until.nearly forty years after the establishment of our 
independence as a republic that the national Conscience 
was touched in the matter; or that any general pro- 
vision was made for the education of Our Indian wards 
through the establishment of schools. This was, per- 
haps, stimulated by the religious revival which swept 
over the country in the first quarter of the nineteenth 
century, inspiring the various denominational societies 
with a new interest in missionary work, and eventually 
moving Congress itself to act. This was in 1819, and Miller, p. 826.

the first appropriation was $10,000, which was repeated 
the next year, and has been considerably increased each 
succeeding year. In 1823 the government contributed 
$12,000 out of $80,000 expended in the maintenance of 
21 schools, religious denominations and private individu- 
als making up the remainder. In 1825 the number had 
increased to 38, to which the government gave $25,000. 
By 1848 there were in operation 16 industrial schools 
and 87 of an elementary nature, all under denomina- 
tional influence, but supported in part by governmental 
appropriation. This method of national participation 
in Indian education was practically the only one in vogue 
until 1873, there being, up to that time, with the excep- 
tion of a few unimportant day schools, none whatever 
under direct government control. 
From that time it has been the policy to control more 
and more fully the schools receiving any part of the 
government appropriation, until now, save for a few 
missionary schools, the entire machinery for the educa- 
tion of the Indians belongs to the national government. 
The move has been an expensive one. Whereas, in 
1880 the appropriation for the purpose was but $75,000, 
in 1885 it was $992,800; in 1890, $1,364,568; in 1895, 
$2,060,695 ; in 1899, $2,638,390; and in 1903, $2,837,786. 
These immense sums are expended in support of 
schools of the following classes : —   a. Non-reservation boarding schools.

many tribes are brought together in a single school, 
often to the obliteration of long-standing hereditary 
prejudices. They are usually, too, situated near towns 
and cities of considerable size, thus bringing the pupils 
in contact with white civilization in a way that none of 
the strictly reservation schools can do. Each school of 
the class has a full instructional and dormitory equip- 
ment, providing a home for the Indian youth for the 
considerable number of years of his attendance. Usu- 
ally, he has been through some of the reservation schools 
before entering this, and, since the more elementary 
branches do not need to be taken, the time can be 
devoted to such subjects as arithmetic, geometry, geog- 
raphy, history, and civil government. Many of these 
schools are so fully equipped for training pupils in 
domestic science and the trades as to be essentially 
industrial schools. 
Among the best known of this class of schools are 
those at Carlisle, Pennsylvania; Chilocco, Oklahoma; 
Genoa, Nebraska; Albuquerque, New Mexico; Lawrence, 
Kansas (the Haskell Institute); Grand Junction, Color-

industrial in their nature, though three of them, the 
Carlisle, the Lawrence, and the Sante Fé schools, have 
normal departments. Each has its dormitories and 
other buildings, besides ample facilities for agricultural 
work, which forms a large part of the course.

6. RESERVATION BOARDING SCHOOLS 
This type of Indian school is much more numerous 
than the preceding, nearly. every reservation having two 
or three, with an average capacity of about 125 pupils. 
Of the 90 now in’ Operation, 5 weré established in the

decade between 1860 and 1869; 25 between 1870 and 
1879; 21 between 1880 and 1889; 26 between 1890 
and 1899; and 11 since 1900. Each school is in charge 
of a superintendent and corps of instructors, as well as 
the necessary domestic servants. The cook, seamstress, 
and laundress instruct the girl pupils in their respective 
lines of work, while a head farmer, a tailor, a shoemaker, 
a carpenter, and a blacksmith, at least in the larger 
schools, perform a similar service for the boys. 
In 1894 kindergartens were made so successful a 
feature of the work that now more than one-half the 
schools have installed them. The aim of the schools, so 
far as instruction is concerned, is to give the pupils the 
ability to read _ simple “English to perform the~simple 
mathematical computations, and to acquire a rudi- 
mentary knowledge of geography,~history, the laws of 
hygiene, and habits of bodily as well as domestic clean- 
liness. The school is a home for the pupil during his 
most impressionable years, and it is more in this capac- 
ity than as a means of merély academic instruction that 
it is accomplishing its best results. The total enrol- 
ment in reservation boarding schools was, in 1902, 
11,506.    
c. THE Day ScHoot 
These_schools do not. differ..materially from the un- 
graded country schools in white communities. Each is 
in.charge-of-a-single teacher— usually a man — with 
some provision made for a housékeeper-—They are lo- 
catéd'in Indian villages or camps, but not on reservations. 
Both a morning and afternoon session of the school is 
held, and“in the poorer communities a simple noonday 
lunch is served the pupils by the housekeeper, at gov- 
ernment expénse.~The-housekeeper-is-also.expected.to 
teach the girls the simpler household duties, as well as 
to visit the homes of the parents and endeavor in every 
way to influence them -in-the-direction-of better living.

e. Mission ScHOOLS 
The preceding classes of schools are the only ones 
through” which the government. attempts.to. educate 
its Indian wards. The missionary work of the various 
Christian denominations for the adult Indians is, how- 
ever, supplemented by schools for the children, con- 
ducted under their auspices. A majority of them are 
reservation boarding schools, in which religious training 
is combined with that of a secular nature. The total 
number of such schools is 49 (2 of which are day 
schools). Of them, 33 (including the day schools) are 
supported by the Roman Catholics, 4 by the Presby- 
terians, 5 by the Episcopalians, 3 by the Congrega- 
tionalists, and 1 each by the Reformed Presbyterian 
and Methodist denominations, and by the Society for 
the Propagation of the Gospel. The enrolment in all 
these schools is 3853 (1902). The schools do not differ 
materially from the reservation boarding schools under 
government support, except for the religious character 
of the work. 
The schools of the so-called “ five civilized nations” 
of Indian Territory are not included within the fore-

In the Cherokee nation the schools are under the 
immediate supervision of its own board of education, 
acting in conjunction with the United States supervisor 
of schools for the nation. Within the nation are 140 
day schools, 1 colored high school, an orphans’ acad- 
emy, and academies for males and females. The enrol- 
ment in these schools is 5383. 
Within the other nations, except the Seminole which

  CHAPTER XXIII 
THE EDUCATION OF DEFECTIVES 
No system of public education is complete which 
fails to make provision for those children whom nature 
has but imperfectly equipped, as to special sense organs 
or brain, for fitting into the complicated social mech- 
anism of modern life. The common school can adapt 
itself to a considerable variation in these respects among 
its pupils, and is called upon to do so; but beyond cer- 
tain limits of organic deficiency they cannot accept 
pupils without positive detriment to the schools; nor 
would the admission of such pupils be of much benefit 
to themselves. Yet there are three distinct classes of 
defectives, tolerated throughout all the preceding cen- 
turies of the world’s history as mere clogs to the wheels 
of progress, which the more scientific and more humani- 
tarian spirit of to-day is trying, and with success, not 
only to make self-supporting, but even to contribute in 
no small degree to the world’s advancement. These 
are the deaf, the blind, and the feeble-minded, as well 
as persons embodying any unfortunate combinations of 
these three defects. 
a. THE DEAF 
The first school for the deaf in this country, indeed 
the first school for any-of the three classes of defectives, 
was opened at Hartford, Connecticut, in 1817, with 
seven pupils. Through the influence of a physician in 
that city whose daughter was deaf, interest had been 
aroused in such a school, some two years previously; and 
470  
-P-A-G-E-495
The Education of Defectives 471 
Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet (¢.v.), a Yale theological Gallaudet 
graduate, sent to study the methods for teaching the 
deaf as practised in Europe. After fruitless efforts to 
gain admission to the schools of Great Britain, which 
were private and conducted for gain, as private monopo- 
lies, he visited the schools of Paris; and, besides making 
a study of them, induced Laureat Clerk, a deaf mute 
himself, though accomplished and an instructor in the 
Paris school, to return with him and undertake the work 
of establishing a similar school in America. These two 
are the parents of the education of the deaf in our 
country. Upon their return to this country, they trav- 
elled extensively, lecturing upon and demonstrating the 
possibility of such education through the living example 
of Clerk himself, and aroused a general interest through- 
out all the Eastern states. As a result, one year later 
(1818), New York followed the example set at Hart- 
ford, employing a teacher from that school. In 1819 
Philadelphia saw the establishment of a similar school. 
In the same year Massachusetts, through state appro- 
priation, sent 20 pupils to the Hartford school, and in 
1825 New Hampshire and Vermont adopted the same 
policy, which was soon followed by other states. The 
first of such schools west of the Alleghanies was 
founded in Kentucky in 1822; and thereafter their estab- 
lishment was comparatively rapid: Ohio following in 
1827, Virginia and Illinois in 1839, Indiana in 1844, 
Tennessee and Georgia in 1846, North Carolina in 1847, 
and South Carolina in 1849; making in all 13 institutions 
previous to 1850. In 1874 the number was 41, in 1890 
it was 48, and in 1901 the total number of schools of all 
classes was 118, 57 of which are state institutions. 
The total number of pupils in all these schools is 
11,343. ee 
The state institutions are in every case boarding 
schools, to which pupils are admitted upon the recom- 
mendation of the principal or some other authorized
-P-A-G-E-496
  P. 166. 472 fligher and Special Education 
person ; and upon the completion of the regular course, 
the students are graduated as are those from any other 
school. Industrial courses are prominent in the curricu- 
lum, 333 of a total of 1035 teachers being occupied 
with trades courses. Kindergartens are maintained in 
connection with 30 of the institutions, and are found 
to be very effective. 
Of the total number of 118 schools for the deaf, 46 
are public day schools, maintained for the most part 
exactly as are the common schools of learning, except 
that special teachers are employed, and special methods, 
of course, followed. This is a comparatively recent 
move, but it is proving eminently successful in reaching 
large numbers of children who would, otherwise, be 
entirely without instruction. Thirty-five cities and 
towns throughout the country now support such schools, 
Chicago taking the lead with twelve. As a state, Wis- 
consin has surpassed any other in providing instruction 
for its deaf mutes in this way, furnishing a special 
teacher at state expense wherever a little circle of such 
children can be gathered near their homes. In this 
way, fifteen towns in the state are provided with special 
schools. Of the whole number of day schools for the 
deaf, but one, the Horace Mann School of Boston, is 
east of Ohio. 
Besides these two classes of schools, the state and the 
public day school, there are several private institutions 
where admission is only by tuition, and where excellent 
work is being done; and the Gallaudet College of Wash- 
ington, D.C., which stands in a class by itself. This was 
established in £857 as the Columbia Institution, in 1864 
was given the name, National Deaf Mute College, and 
later, the one it now bears. Besides a department re- 
sembling very much the State Institutions for the Deaf, 
it has one for advanced work, in which degrees are 
given. It is the principal source of supply for teachers.
-P-A-G-E-497
The Education of Defectives 473 
Methods of Instruction 
Owing to the inability of Gallaudet to gain admission 
to the English and Scotch schools in 1817, the purely P. 47. 
manual method of the French was introduced in 
America and remained supreme for forty years. In 
it, all communication is through the sign language, no 
attempts at oral articulation being introduced. But in 
1843 Horace Mann and Dr. Howe of the Perkins Insti- 
tute for the Blind at Boston, while in Europe, investi- 
gated the merits of the oral method which had been 
introduced there, and being favorably impressed with it, 
Mann urged its general introduction in his next annual 
report. This was the beginning of a controversy which 
is not yet settled, and which has divided the ranks of 
teachers of the deaf into two opposing schools. By the 
oral method, articulate speech is taught, even to those 
who have been totally deaf since birth, The advan- 
tages of this method seemingly more than overbalance 
its disadvantages, which latter rest principally upon the 
greater age which pupils must have reached before in- 
struction is possible, and it is gradually gaining ground. 
At present, it is in practice in nearly all the public and 
private day schools in the country ; and in the state in- 
stitutions 3748 pupils are being taught by that system 
alone, 4292 by a combination of it with the manual, 
while 2979 are studying the manual system alone. 
  | 6. THE BLIND 
Owing, perhaps, to the fact that the sightless do not 
seem to be so fully cut off from the world as do the deaf, 
public sympathy was not aroused in the United States 
to the point of establishing an institution for their in- 
struction for nearly fifteen years after the opening of 
the American School for the Deaf at Hartford. In 
1829 the New England Asylum for the Blind was incor-
-P-A-G-E-498

  474 Higher and Special Education 
porated in Boston, but it was three years before Dr. 
Samuel G. Howe (g.v.), who was selected to be its head, 
could make the necessary investigation abroad and open 
the school. When this was done, in 1832, an institution 
in New York City had already been opened, antedating 
that in Boston by a few months. The next year (1833) 
a similar school was opened at Philadelphia. These 
three pioneer institutions were all private corporations, 
and remain so to this day. Pupils from these schools, 
and especially the Perkins school (Boston), were exhib- 
ited in various parts of the country until public interest 
was fully aroused and the states began to take action 
through the establishment of schools of their own. 
Ohio was the first to do so, in 1837; Virginia followed 
in 1839; Kentucky, in 1842; Tennessee, in 1846; Indi- 
ana, in 1847; Illinois, in 1849; and Wisconsin, in 1850. 
By 1860, 10 more had followed. In 1874 the total num- 
ber of institutions was 29 ; in 1890, was 33; and in 1901, 
was 39, with a total of 4199 pupils. All these schools 
belong to one class — the boarding school — and all are 
maintained in part or wholly by public taxes. In them 
all, manual and industrial courses have a prominent 
place, not only because of the importance of teaching 
the pupil a trade which might provide support after 
graduation, but because it is by doing and_ constructing 
that the blind especially learn best. Gloyd) has been 
found to be well adapted to their needs. “A”great many 
trades have at one time or another found place in the 
curricula of the schools; but only a few, and those the 
simple ones, such as chair caning, hammock making, 
broom making, carpet weaving, and a few others have 
proved wholly suitable. 
Music has a place in every school, not only because 
it opens up a wide vocational field to the blind, but 
because of the delightful diversion it provides. Many 
of the blind are unusually gifted and are graduated as 
organists, teachers of music, and piano tuners. Only 
 
-P-A-G-E-499
    
The Education of Defectives 475 
those pupils who show aptitude are allowed to specialize 
in music, and not even those, at the expense of the 
academic subjects. 
The kindergarten is an almost universal part of the 
school for the blind, and no other educational method 
has been found so effective as the Froebelian. The 
games and occupations seem to meet exactly the needs 
of codrdination between the senses still active, and the 
little pupils seem to miss but little that the perfect child 
gains. 
In the matter of literature for the blind, three distinct 
systems of raised printing are in vogue. The oldest is 
the system of embossed letters, differing but little from 
the lower case letter of an ordinary printed page, in- 
vented by Dr. Howe. It has the advantage of being 
easily read by the seeing eye without special training, 
but requires an extremely delicate sense of touch to 
decipher with the finger tips. So much so that Superin- 
tendent Wait of the New York institution has said that 
“only 34 per cent of them [the blind] will ever be able 
to read it with pleasure or profit.” The next system to 
be introduced, the New York Point, was invented by 
Mr. Wait, and consists of an arbitrary arrangement of 
embossed dots, easily readable through the sense of 
touch, though requiring special training to be read by 
the eye. The latest isa combination of this system with 
the French Braille system, and is known as the American 
Braille. The two last-mentioned systems are those prin- 
cipally in use to-day. Typewriters have been invented 
for writing in them, and also a modified typewriter for 
printing upon brass plates, from which any number of 
copies can be struck off. Printing houses have been 
established, one subsidized by Congress, for the printing 
of books for the blind; and in all, there are more than 
one hundred thousand volumes in the libraries of the 
schools for the blind.

} c. THE DEAF-BLIND 
It is in the instances of the few unfortunates lacking 
both the senses of hearing and of sight, that the really 
wonderful possibilities in the education of defectives has 
shown itself most forcibly. Laura Bridgeman, who 
spent more than fifty years of her life at the Perkins 
Institute, is the historic case, though her accomplish- 
ments are made to pale before those of Helen Keller,

d@. THE FEEBLE-MINDED 
It was not until 1846 that any movement in the direc- 
tion of providing schools for the mentally deficient, or 
idiots, as they were then universally called, was made in 
this country, and the interest began almost simulta- 
neously in Massachusetts and New York. The former 
state, however, seeméd most ready to act, and in 1848 an 
experimental school was opened in Boston under the 
direction of Dr. Howe of the Perkins Institute. In the 
same year a private school of the same general char- 
acter was founded at Barre, Massachusetts. New York 
followed in 1851 with a state institution situated at Syra- 
cuse; Pennsylvania, in 1853, at Media; Ohio, in 1857, at 
Columbus ; Kentucky, in 1860, at Frankfort; and Illinois, 
in 1865, at Jacksonville. 
The growth of these schools has never been rapid. 
In 1890 there were 17 public and 10 private schools in 
the country, while in 1901 the numbers were 20 and 12 
respectively, with a total of 11,149 pupils in the former 
and 468 in the latter. There is no regular course in’ 
these institutions from which the pupils graduate at a

specified time; in fact, the most that can be hoped for 
in the education of many of the pupils is to teach them 
so much as to make it possible for them to lead a happy 
life within the institution; in others a certain degree 
of usefulness may be developed, while with the milder 
cases some considerable academic education is possible. 
The kindergarten is an important factor, and many 
pupils never get beyond it. Entertainments are fre- 
quent, and highly enjoyed. The brighter pupils learn 
to read and write and to use some few of the arithmeti- 
cal processés, but seldom to reason in the abstract. 
The girls—and all the pupils are boys and girls, no 
matter what the age—are taught to do the cooking, 
sewing, and washing for the school, while the boys work 
upon the farm, make the shoes, and even in one institu- 
tion (Indiana) the bricks of which the buildings are 
constructed. In this way, the institutions are at least in 
part, self-supporting, and their further development is 
by far the most economical way for the support of this 
class of unfortunates, which has always been so largely 
a dead weight upon the community.

EDUCATIONAL EXTENSION 
Tue history of education in a country like ours would 
not be complete without a consideration of certain insti- 
tutions entirely outside the organized machinery of the 
schools, which contribute largely to the general culture 
and extended scholarship of great masses of the people. 
Schools are primarily for the youth. Of necessity, the 
greater number in attendance upon them must depend 
upon others for their support; cannot themselves be 
producers; are members of the leisure class, so far as 
contribution to the world’s economic progress goes. 
Since, however, no social mechanism can support profit- 
ably too large a leisure class, nor a leisure class for too 
long, the time comes when the youth must enter the 
ranks of producers, leaving the school days behind. 
The exact stage at which this change must take place is 
determined by the general economic conditions of the 
country. 
In 1800 the daily per capita production of wealth 
for the United States was about ten cents. In 1850 it 
had arisen to thirty cents, in 1880 to forty-four cents, in 
1890 to fifty-two cents, and is to-day (1903) upward of 
sixty cents. 
This increased productiveness has been at the bottom 
of the rapid increase in secondary and higher education; 
since, with the greater earning capacity of the head of 
the family, the youth — especially the boys—could be 
longer spared to avail themselves of advantages which 
the schools offer. 
Yet these facts make possible the postponement for a

Ig0I, p. 180,

few years only of the cessation of active school work. 
Eventually it must come, and thereafter education be an 
avocation, rather than a vocation; a by-product rather 
than the principal aim of life. Yet the maximum of use- 
fulness on the part of the individual demands that edu- 
cative processes be continued, and it is a recognition of 
this fact that has given rise to those institutions which 
make such continuation possible. 
These may be divided into two general classes : — 
1st. Those that may be made use of entirely within 
the home. 
a. Libraries. 
b. Mewspapers and periodicals. 
2d. Those which take one outside the home, yet which 
do not seriously interfere with business occupations. 
a. Summer schools and assemblies. 
b. Evening and correspondence schools. 
c. Learned societies. 
d. Lecture courses and lyceums.

  CHAPTER XXIV 
LIBRARIES 
Pustic libraries, in the sense of collections of books 
purchased and maintained by public taxation for the free 
use of the people, are a development of the last half of 
the nineteenth century. As far back as 1803, the town 
of Salisbury, Connecticut, received by bequest the pri- 
vate library of Caleb Bingham, and made some additions 
to it by town grant, but the collection of books is no 
longer in existence, and can hardly be said to have fig- 
ured at all prominently in the general library movement. 
The town of Peterborough, New Hampshire, lays claim, 
and perhaps with some justice, to having been the birth- 
place of the public library. In 1833 that town voted to 
use a certain sum of money received from the state as 
the proceeds of a general taxation of banks, for the pur- 
chase of books for a town library to be free to the people 
of the town. Since this was sixteen years before a law 
was passed in any state providing for a library tax, it is 
probable that it was not only the first publicly supported 
library in the country, but also in the world. This does 
not mean, however, that there were not at this time 
many collections of books under corporate ownership, 
and even accessible, with some restrictions, to the public 
at large. The colleges and universities had from the 
first established libraries for the use of their students and 
faculties, though these have figured but slightly as forces 
contributing to the general development of the public 
library of to-day. Although the library of Harvard Col- 
lege, founded in 1638, was without doubt the first in our 
land to be used by any constituency larger than a single

family, it is to the learned society and the private cor- 
poration that we must look for the direct antecedent of 
libraries for the people; and our study takes us back to 
Benjamin Franklin —the originator of so many useful 
institutions —and the American Philosophical Society 
in Philadelphia. The story of the foundation of this so- 
ciety, the oldest of its kind in the country, and its library, 
are delightfully told by Franklin in his autobiography. 
The first books purchased were received from London 
in 1732, and were kept in the rooms of Robert Grace, 
one of Franklin’s friends, and an associate in the estab- 
lishment of the library. An attendant was on duty for 
one hour on Wednesdays, and two hours on Saturdays, 
and was allowed, as the record shows, to permit “any 
civil gentleman to peruse the books of the library, in the 
library room, but not to lend or suffer to be taken out of 
the library, by any person who is not a subscribing 
member, any of the said books, Mr. James Logan only 
excepted.” 
Here we have the first evidence of a willingness on the 
part of library authorities to allow any kind of public par- 
ticipation in their privileges. It is doubtful if they were 
much bothered by a reading public, for both inclination 
and ability to read were lacking on the part of the great 
mass of the community, but the spirit, nevertheless, 
meant much. Here and there a library followed their 
plan, for the eighteenth century saw as many as a dozen 
collections of books under society ownership in various 
parts of the country. 
Notable among them, both for its generosity and the 
cumbrousness of its statement, was the Redwood Library 
of Newport, Rhode Island, founded in 1747. Its charter 
states it to be “a library whereunto the curious and im- 
patient enquirer after resolution of doubts, and the be- 
wildered ignorant, might freely repair for discovery and 
demonstration to the one and true knowledge and satis- 
faction to the other; nay, to inform the mind in both, in 
order to reform the practice.”

It is interesting to note the humanitarian and public- 
spirited views of these promoters of subscription libra- 
ries of the eighteenth century. They seem, however, for 
the most part, in spite of their literary benevolence, to 
have been possessed of the belief that books were things 
to be hoarded rather than to be used; and moreover that 
the people as a class had little use for such things, or 
such things for the people. In the latter particular they 
were probably not far from correct. The ability toread 
books must precede their usefulness, and in addition, 
economic conditions must be such as to provide leisure 
for their perusal. Seemingly these two conditions were 
slow in being attained, for it was more than a century 
after the American Philosophical and the Redwood | 
Libraries had opened their doors that the public library | 
movement was really under way. Libraries had sprung 
up, meanwhile, in most of the large cities of the coun- | 
try, and in many of the smaller towns, but they failed to Adams, pp. 2-37, 
touch the people. They were supported and patronized 
by what might be called a literary aristocracy, and the| 
masses felt that they had no share in them. It was no. 
doubt, in part, due to the prevalence of the lyceum in The American 
the fourth and fifth decades of the nineteenth century, 2¥¢eum, P. 569. 
bringing the masses, as it did, into new fields of thought ; 
and, in part, to the increased leisure resultant upon a 
less rigorous struggle for existence, that organized at- 
tempts were made about the middle of the century to 
provide more general library facilities through state 
action. 
Scoot District LIBRARIES 
This move took form in the establishment of district, 
school libraries, New York State taking the lead in 1835, 
and being followed by twenty-one other states. The 
plan does not seem to have been successful. The unit Siac ae 
of administration was too small, and, except as it paved 6: 254. 
the way for other methods through familiarizing the peo-

ple with the idea of free books for everybody to read, 
the district library hardly fulfilled the great expectations 
of its promoters. This being the case, the ardent be- 
lievers in the efficiency of books as instruments of edu- 
cation (and there were many such, even at this time), 
began to cast about for some more satisfactory plan. It 
took the form of a law enabling ¢owms to establish and 
maintain libraries by public taxation. This proved to be 
the right thing at the right time. 
Town LIBRARIES 
To New Hampshire, the state in which public funds 
had first been devoted to library purposes sixteen years 
earlier, falls the honor of the first enactment of such a 
law in 1849, though that state perhaps got the idea from 
a bill passed by the Massachusetts legislature one year 
previous, granting similar privileges to the city of 
Boston. The New Hampshire law of 1849 was very 
simple in form, and its main features remain unchanged. 
Under its authority any town may raise and appropriate 
money for establishing and maintaining a library without 
limitation as to amount, the money to be raised by ordi- 
nary taxation. 
Idem, pp. 523- Fundamentally the library laws of all the other states 
597 do not differ from the New Hampshire law of 1849, 
though in some, notably New York, other concessions to 
library interests have been made, and the wonderful de- 
velopments at the end of the nineteenth century, which 
have given rise to its characterization as the Age of 
Libraries, are directly attributable to them. 
The following states have passed permissive library

In addition to this legislation of a purely permissive 
nature, many states, mostly in the East, have passed 
laws, tending directly to encourage the growth of public 
libraries through special grants of money and in other 
ways. 
In this move Massachusetts led, by the appointment 
in 1890 of a special commission of five persons to look 
after library interests and foster their growth throughout 
the state. In the first report made by this commission 
special attention was called to those towns which had no 
public libraries. The effect of this undesirable promi- 
nence was such that during the year 1891 thirty-six 
towns established them, and at the end of ten years only 
four or five towns and less than one-half of one per cent 
of the population were without their influence. 
New Hampshire followed a year later with similar 
legislation, and again in 1893 took the lead in library 
legislation by enacting the law that “each town shail 
assess annually a sum to be computed at the rate of 
thirty dollars for every dollar of the state tax appor- 
tioned to each town . . . to be appropriated to the sole 
purpose of establishing and maintaining a free public 
library within said town.” It also provided that in case 
this sum be less than $100, the state should make it
-P-A-G-E-510
  Fletcher, p. 27. 486 Educational Extension 
up to that amount. The influence of this legislation 
was what might be expected, and other states were not 
slow to fall in line, some twenty having in the next ten 
years appointed library commissions and made specific 
moves toward library encouragement. 
The effect of all this has been, not only to multiply 
libraries, but to increase in many ways their efficiency. 
The best thought has been bestowed upon the problem ; 
and, whereas even a generation ago the public library 
had a comparatively small constituency, it is now a force 
directly felt by the vast majority of people in nearly 
every community. This has been brought about largely 
through changes or innovations, the most important of 
which has been the making of books more accessible to 
the people. 
Liprary EXTENSION 
In Bulletin No. 40 of the Home Education Depart- 
ment of the University of New York, Melvil Dewey, 
its director, says :— 
“ The original library was a storehouse in which books could be 
preserved, and passed on to posterity. To get and to keep were the 
chief functions, while to use was subordinate. Only a favored few 
had access to the books. Then a broadening process began. Those 
who could pay a certain fee might use the library. Then came the 
broad thought of making it free to all, but only for use in the build- 
ing, as the present museum is used. The old librarian would have 
been as much shocked at the suggestion of taking a book from the 
building, as would the modern curator of a museum if an interested 
child should ask to carry home the bird of paradise. Then came the 
lending to the favored few, then to all who could pay the fee, and 
finally the great thought of lending free to all. But this was by no 
means the end realized that if they were to do the best work they 
must have this aggressive spirit, and adopt the aggressive methods 
of those who make other enterprises most successful. Then came 
the branch in the larger cities in order to reduce the difficulties of 
inaccessibility, and get within a reasonable distance of each home a 
collection of books and an inviting reading room. The more widely 
scattered delivery stations followed, so that the workman could readily
-P-A-G-E-511
    Libraries 487 
return his book in the morning and get a new one on the way back 
without going much out of his usual course. Then books were sent 
out for a trifling fee to those who could not conveniently come after 
them. ... Yet all this did not meet the demand, and we realized 
that the new conditions brought about by cheap and quick trans- 
portation demanded new methods in solving our problem of ‘the best 
reading for the largest number at the least cost.’” 
This result was the travelling library. 
Open Shelves 
The first move in the direction of accessibility was the 
open shelf. The old adage, “If you don’t see what you 
want, ask for it,” will not work with the mass of modern 
public library users, for a great majority do not know 
well enough what they want to ask for it. It worked 
well enough when the patrons were few and trained, but 
not to-day. The shopkeeper has solved the problem 
through the show window, so arranged as to create a 
desire, even if it did not previously exist. The modern, 
up-to-date librarian has done the same by throwing open 
his book stacks, at least a part of them, to the public. 
It is of course necessary to preserve the most valuable 
works and the rare editions from excessive handling, but 
this in no way interferes with the plan which has become 
quite general, and is undoubtedly an important factor in 
increasing the clientage of the modern public library. 
There are still some large libraries which are more con- 
servative than others, as, for instance, those of Boston, 
Chicago, and St. Louis; but in Cleveland, Buffalo, Phila- 
delphia, Milwaukee, Denver, Kansas City (Missouri), 
Toledo, and Springfield (Massachusetts), and many other 
cities, the plan has been so successful as to make it a 
safe one to follow. Cleveland was the first city (1886) 
to make use of it, and now 100,000 of its 150,000 vol- 
umes are freely accessible to the public. The Phila- 
delphia public library is the largest with the open-shelf
-P-A-G-E-512
    488 Educational Extension i 
system, lilting nearly all of its 234,000 volumes freely 
accessible, Of the plan Mr. Thompson, its librarian, 
says :— 
“T have no hesitation whatever in saying that there is no limit 
whatever to the number of books to be placed on the open shelves. 
If open shelves had been risky, then there is no doubt that the dan- 
ger would have been felt in a city the size of Philadelphia. In small 
cities and towns the readers are known to the attendants; in cities 
like Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia, of course the larger num- 
ber are unknown. The loss from theft has in our case proved insig- 
nificant. e number of books lost in one year does not amount in 
volume to the salary of one employee. The safeguard of closed 
shelves would require the services of several attendants, and the 
difference between closed and open shelves, so far as the service to 
the public is concerned, does not admit of discussion. Persons using 
libraries by means of the catalog or cards only, cannot gain one-third 
of the benefit that is procurable by a person who has free access to 
the books themselves.” 
Similar reports come from other librarians who are ina 
position to observe the benefits of the open shelf. At 
the Wardner’s Library in Springfield, Massachusetts, 
not a single book was lost from 25,000 to which the 
public had free access, in the course of a whole year. 
Liprary SuB-STATIONS 
The next move in library extension, after that of get- 
ting the people to the books, as exemplified by the open- 
shelf plan, was that of getting the books to the people. 
It soon became evident that in spite of the tremendous 
increase in the number of libraries, they were still too 
far from the mass of the people to be of the greatest 
use. The remedy was the institution of branch libraries 
and charging stations, so located with reference to the 
principal residence centres and factories in the larger 
cities, as to make it possible for any one to get and re- 
turn books without going much out of his way. The 
plan has wrought havoc with many of the pet ideas of 
 
-P-A-G-E-513
  
Libraries 489 
the old-school librarians, but it is in the line of greater 
efficiency, and is being developed in nearly every large 
city; and in some rural communities, as rapidly as funds 
will permit. The general idea has already taken form 
in the following ways :— 
a. Branch libraries containing permanent collections 
of books and performing all the functions of a small, 
independent library. 
6. Delivery stations where books may be ordered 
from the main library, and through which they may be 
returned, but where no permanent collection is kept. 
¢. Deposit stations, to which small collections of books 
are sent from the main library to be freely circulated, 
and then returned as a whole for a new collection. 
These offshoots of the public library are as logical a 
growth in the larger centres of populations as are the 
ward school buildings. There is no more reason why 
all the books should be housed in a central library build- 
ing than that all the children should go to some one 
common schoolhouse. In fact, the reasons are equally 
good why neither should be the case. 
a. Branch Libraries 
Of the three forms of library extension mentioned 
above, that of the branch library is undoubtedly the 
most efficient, as it carries with it the services of a 
trained librarian. Since the function of the library is 
to interest the reader, as well as to provide books, this 
is a matter of no small consequence. From the stand- 
point of this influence, the branch has an advantage over 
the main library, since its clientage is small, and the 
librarian can better know the interests of each individual, 
and cater to them. The readers, too, have a feeling of 
ownership in a small library, simply equipped, which 
they never feel in going into a magnificent building. 
The rapidity with which branch libraries have been  
-P-A-G-E-514
  490 Educational Extension 
establishedl in the larger cities renders it impossible to 
make any statement of their number which would be 
valid for more than a few months. In 1902 Boston 
had 10; New York City, 13; Philadelphia, 8; Buffalo, 
2; Chicago, 6; Pittsburg, 6; and Brooklyn, 18, as yet 
without a central library. New York and Washington, 
with their magnificent Carnegie gifts, will soon take a 
lead in the matter of branch libraries which will place 
them far in advance of any other city. 
It is an interesting indication of the incompleteness 
with which the central library had covered its field, to 
note that with the establishment of branches, a new im- 
petus was given the circulation of the main library. In 
the case of Boston, during the two years following the 
establishment of the first branch, the circulation in the 
main library had increased 90,880 volumes, as compared 
with an increase of 35,236 for the two years next pre- 
ceding. The report of the Cleveland library also states 
that one-half its circulation is through branches, without 
lessening the use of the main library. 
6. Delivery Stations 
The type of delivery station almost universal, is that 
located in a grocery, dry-goods, or drug store, or any 
place of business which can be secured for the purpose. 
The proprietor of the store forwards to the main library 
orders for the books, with the reader’s card, and delivers 
the books to him when they arrive. His responsibility 
is slight, and he has nothing to do with the charging of 
books. As a compensation, he receives a small stated 
sum from the library fund, or in some cities a certain 
amount for each book handled. 
In spite of the fact that the plan of delivery stations 
is being constantly extended, their desirability is some- 
times questioned.

“We believe the system of home delivery to be far preferable and 
more advantageous in every way for our members than the plan of 
delivery stations.” 
The authorities of the Cleveland Public Library also 
say :— 
“The system seems indispensable, but continues to be the most 
expensive and least satisfactory work that we do.” 
This is because the work is all done at arm’s length. 
The borrowers have no opportunity of seeing the books, 
which they are obliged to select from the catalogue, and 
the assistants at the library have no opportunity to see 
the borrowers, whose wants they try to fill. 
In spite, however, of these difficulties, present library 
administration seems to demand them. Chicago has 
nearly 70, St. Louis, 48, Buffalo, 8, Cincinnati, 33, and 
Cleveland, 4 delivery stations. 
c. Deposit Stations 
In the deposit station many of the disadvantages of 
the mere delivery station are wanting. It has all the 
merits of a small branch library, except that of a trained 
librarian. Books may be handled and taken out; and, 
with some care on the part of the library authorities in 
the selection of books, a better class may be put in cir- 
culation than by the other plan. 
The more common places for such stations are fire- 
engine houses, police stations, factories, street railway 
barns, social settlements, homes, public schools, and 
public parks. In each case a collection of books varying 
in number from a dozen to several hundred is sent in a 
suitable case and left until it has fulfilled its purpose, 
when it is exchanged for another. In the engine houses 
they have worked particularly well. The men have, 
 
-P-A-G-E-516
    
492 Educational Extension 
under ordinary circumstances, plenty of leisure and 
make the fullest use of the books which they would 
probably not take the trouble to go to the library 
to secure. Buffalo has 84 such stations, Boston, 
41, Cleveland, 26, and New York City, nearly 100. 
Neither police stations, railway trains, nor factories seem 
to have been as fully used for deposits of books as have 
engine houses, but the move in the direction of their 
fuller utilization is under way in many of the large 
cities. In the plan of home deposits, the Carnegie 
Library of Pittsburg seems to have taken the lead: In 
Igor there were reported twenty-six such deposits with 
a membership of 4o1. In locating these centres for 
library extension, the school-teacher has been of much 
help. Most of the deposits are scattered through the 
city in districts not reached by the central library nor 
by any of its branches. 
School Deposits 
If we may judge by their prevalence, by far the most 
efficient deposit of books is that in the public school. 
We can, in fact, hardly estimate the educational impor- 
tance of this plan of library extension. The reading 
habit, if formed at all, will, in nine cases out of ten, be 
formed during childhood. It cannot, however, be ac- 
quired without books, and will not, in most cases, if the 
child must go to the books. The books, then, of the 
right sort must go to the child, and since libraries are 
among the last things to which the ordinary school 
board will devote funds, the public libraries are supply- 
ing the lack, and doing so most generously. They are 
following one of two plans: either that of making de- 
posits of books in each separate room, under the direction 
of its teacher ; or of furnishing some general library room, 
either within each building or in the public library, to be 
used by all the pupils. The former plan has been in
-P-A-G-E-517
Libraries 493 
vogue in Detroit for about fifteen years, and at 
present 80 boxes, containing in all about 10,000 vol- 
umes, are circulating in all grades above the fourth. 
Buffalo has 457 such classroom libraries, with 20,346 
volumes, which in the year 1900 were charged 194,045 
times for withdrawal. Mr. Crunden of the St. Louis 
public library, while employing the general plan of 
sending to the schools selections of books, has supple- 
mented it by depositing enough copies of certain ones 
to supply each pupil in the room. Of this plan he 
says:— 
“It is better to send thirty copies of the same book than thirty 
different books for two reasons: first, because it enables the teacher 
to have class exercises; second, because the interest of each pupil is 
greatly intensified when all his classmates are reading the same 
book. It gives them all a common subject of conversation and edi- 
fying topics to supplant the vulgarities of boys and the vanities of 
girls. And this is one of the incidental benefits of literature in a 
school, which is of no small importance.” 
These sets of thirty are sent to the schools on request 
of the principal for a period of two weeks, with the privi- 
lege of renewal. Three hundred sets are in circulation. 
The second plan mentioned for school deposits has 
been very fully worked out by the Brookline, Massachu- 
setts, public library. In its report for 1900 we find :— 
“The most important development of the Brookline public library 
has been an extension of its work done with the public schools. The 
. chief characteristics of the work have been: Ist, Visiting the schools 
by an assistant to train the minds of the pupils and teachers. 2d, Is- 
suing to teachers, beside the seven books allowed for their personal 
use, twenty or more books each, drawn either from the special col- 
lection in the school reference room which contains many duplicates 
or from the general library, to be used by the pupils in school or 
home, in connection with their lessons or simply for recreative read- 
ing. 3d, The special assistant has charge of the school reference 
room during the afternoon, and assists pupils who resort there for 
the purpose of looking up topics of study or for collateral reading. 
4th, Systematic instruction in the use of the library is given by the 
assistant in charge of the pupils of the eighth and ninth grades of   
Crunden!, p. 109, 
 
-P-A-G-E-518
  494 Educational Extension 
the grammar schools and the first year of the high school, who are 
brought there in classes, accompanied by their teachers. The low- 
est grade is taught about the makeup of a book, the title page, copy- 
right, table of contents, index, and how to use them; also the chief 
facts about the binding and the use of the commoner reference 
books. The next grade takes up the more advanced reference books 
and learns the use of the card catalogue; while the high school stu- 
dents are doing some simple bibliographical work.” 
| 
From the standpoint of the educator this would seem 
to be the most helpful correlation possible between the 
library and the school. As valuable as the schoolroom 
deposits are proving, there is the danger that the pupil 
will associate them wholly with the school, and through 
their exclusive use, fail to come in contact with the 
general library. In that case, the reading habit, even 
though acquired, might be lost with the school days. 
The schoolroom deposit might make the pupil a stranger 
to the public library and never give him a “smell of the 
leather,’’ which meant so much to Lowell and others 
who have so loved the crowded alcove. 
The latest move of the deposit stations has been to 
the public park and recreation grounds. The plan has 
not yet been developed to its full possibility in any city, 
though beginnings have been made in several. The 
first attempt seems to have been made in Tompkins 
Park,-Brooklyn, in the summer of 1899, at which time 
a collection of one thousand books for children was 
installed in the pavilion. It is too soon to say what the 
scheme may lead to. But it would seem as if this might 
be one of the most useful forms of library extension. 
TRAVELLING LIBRARIES 
Although our country cannot claim to be the birth- 
place of the travelling library, it is with us that the plan 
is being developed to its fullest usefulness. The scheme 
of sending boxes of books from place to place in order 
to reach those who would otherwise be without reading 
 
-P-A-G-E-519
Bae I MEARE TERING PE ES Pee ey RM Me ee) WI re eae Pew CT, ie Oe na 
Libraries 495 
matter, is not one of recent date. As long ago as 1825, 
one Samuel Brown of the East Lothian region of Scot- 
land instigated a move which placed in circulation no 
less than nineteen so-called “itinerant libraries,” each 
- containing fifty volumes and making a circuit of fifteen 
stations, each with its own librarian. On this side of 
the water, the manager of the American Lyceum first P. 569. 
made use of the plan in 1831, and since that time certain 
railroad: corporations, as well as the Seaman’s Friend 
Society, have employed it. In each case, however, the 
books were only for the favored few: either those who 
had become regular subscribers through the payment of 
a fee, or the beneficiaries of the company or association 
owning the libraries. It was in New York State that 
the scheme was first applied to the free public library, 
and it is within that state that it has seen its fullest 
development. The rules adopted under the legislature 
of 1892 provide that a collection of one hundred books 
may be lent from the state library for six months to 
any public library of the state; or where no library exists, 
anywhere upon the petition of twenty-five resident tax- 
payers, provided some person owning real estate will 
hold himself responsible for the books. A fee of $5 
is demanded to cover the cost of transportation and inci- 
dental expenses. A later rule is made to cover a selec- 
tion of twenty-five books, the fee being $3. 
The first library went out in February, 1893. The 
plan met with a success unhoped for even by its ardent 
advocates, and was rapidly extended, 35,624 volumes 
having been sent out from the state library at Albany 
during the university year 1899-1900. Besides, public 
libraries, and groups of twenty-five tax-payers, school 
extension centres, summer schools, study clubs, and 
private guarantors participated in the plan. Moreover, 
books, pictures, lantern slides, and lanterns for project- 
tion purposes were similarly loaned. By these means 
the library at Albany is making itself felt throughout    
-P-A-G-E-520
ASS a i | EE a Dk | 
496 Educational Extension 
its constituency as is no other state library in the coun- 
try. Following its leadership, several other state libra- 
ries, not a few city libraries, and several clubs and 
associations of a private character maintain travelling 
libraries. In 1901, some one or more of these agencies 
were maintaining travelling libraries in the states of 
Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecti- 
cut, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, 
’ Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, 
Texas, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, LIllinois, 
| Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kan- 
| sas, Nebraska, North Dakota, Montana, Colorado, 
Oregon, Idaho, and Washington. 
An interesting elaboration of the scheme has been 
worked out by the New York state library in the form 
of a book wagon. A large covered wagon is used, 
holding a number of separate libraries with different 
selections of books, and a definite route is covered at 
stated intervals. A trained librarian is in charge. The 
supposition is that he, through conversation with the 
people in his route, will discover their special interests 
and be of service in the selection of books which shall 
meet the wants of each. | 
With this, plans for making the library accessible to 
the people seem to have reached the maximum of devel- 
opment —a development remarkable indeed when we 
consider that from the stage of no libraries to this of 
the itinerant “missionary of the book” only the brief 
space of fifty years has elapsed. It is true that but a 
few counties in a single state have as yet heard the 
clank of his wagon wheels; but, with a people as ready 
as ours to see the good and to appropriate it, we need 
hardly expect another fifty years to have elapsed before 
the book wagon will be as familiar a sight, even in the 
remotest regions, as is Uncle Sam's rural delivery cart.

CHILDREN’s Rooms 
A recent library move of much importance educa- 
tionally is the establishment of children’s rooms. Most 
libraries have had an age limit to the borrowers of 
books. As a result, children could enjoy their advan- 
tages only through the courtesy of an adult; and, even 
then, without that feeling of equal participation which 
is such an important factor. The public library of Brook- 
line, Massachusetts, deserves the credit, in 1890, for be- 
ing the first to open a special room for the little folks. 
From this modest beginning —for it was only an un- 
used basement room which was devoted to the pur- 
pose — has sprung one of the most promising forms of 
library extension, in some libraries even rivalling the 
department for adults in its prominence. With the 
initial step taken at Brookline, other cities were not 
slow in following the example. Minneapolis, in 1893, 
opened a similar room, though much more invitingly 
arranged; and in 1894 the public libraries of Denver, 
Colorado, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, made similar 
provisions for the wants of the child. Since that time 
the development has been too rapid to follow. 
The children’s room, as ordinarily maintained, per- 
forms a twofold function; that of reading room, and 
of circulating department. though the latter is not al- 
ways a feature. From three hundred volumes to ten 
times as many, carefully selected for the children’s 
wants, are upon the shelves — which are in every case 
open to the children —in the various children’s rooms 
of different libraries, and one or more special librarians 
are in most cases in constant attendance. Suitable 
magazines are taken and are on file; and in every pos- 
sible way the rooms are made as attractive as possible 
for the little folks. Tables, chairs, reading desks, and 
shelves are of sizes best adapted to their needs: the 
pictures upon the walls and other decorations of the 
2K
-P-A-G-E-522
    498 Educational Extension 
rooms are of such a character as to meet their appre- 
ciation. | 
The whole move is in too early an infancy properly 
to estimate, but if we may be allowed to predict, it must 
take rank in the very forefront of important steps in 
library extension. | 
Private Bequests to Libraries 
The American people has of late years shown its 
appreciation of the public library movement, not only 
by its willingness to devote public funds to its further- 
ance, but also by generous private bequests. Hundreds 
of cities and towns throughout the country owe their 
library buildings either wholly or in part to the latter. 
The magnitude of recent gifts for library purposes is 
shown by the following table.

Although this unprecedented munificence comprises 
gifts from hundreds of persons, those of Mr. Andrew 
Carnegie so far surpass those of any other person — in 
fact, those of all other persons put together — as to make 
him a veritable colossus among library benefactors. 
Previous to the year 1899, he had given $5,811,000 to 
the cause. In 1899 his gifts amounted to the sum of
-P-A-G-E-523
  
Libraries 499 
$3,503,500; in 1900, to $640,000; in 1901, to $12,888,- 
500; in 1902, to $2,598,500; and in 1903 to $5,633,500, 
making a grand total of $31,075,000. His first benefac- 
tions were to the city of Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and 
towns in its immediate vicinity ; but later they have been 
extended, until no part of the country is without his in- 
fluence. His custom is to erect the library building in 
whatever town or city he deems worthy, after investiga- 
tion, stipulating only that a suitable site be provided, 
and that adequate funds be raised by taxation for its 
maintenance. In this way more than three hundred 
libraries have been endowed by him. Some communi- 
ties have refused this aid, asserting that its tendency was 
to pauperize, rather than to stimulate a healthy library 
interest. Such refusals have, however, been few. Gen- 
erally the wisdom of the gifts has been recognized, and 
we cannot doubt that by them interest in libraries has 
been tremendously stimulated. 
A library movement which has established its com- 
mercial success, as well as its educational value, was 
started in Philadelphia, in March, 1900, under the title, 
The Booklover’s Library. Its founder was Mr. Seymour 
Eaton, and he has ever since been the prime mover in 
the undertaking. It is conducted as a private club, to 
which membership is by election. It now has centres in 
nearly every city of any size in the country. At each 
of the principal centres is a library, from which books 
are sent, by special carriers, to all the members residing 
within the city or its suburbs, and to those at a distance 
by express. This feature of home delivery has given to 
the Booklover’s Library an almost phenomenal growth, 
as, according to its latest reports, it is sending out to its 
patrons more than ten million volumes a year. Mem- 
bership in the library is of several classes, with a sliding 
scale according to the number of books which one may 
receive at a time. Special attention is taken to keep 
the volumes fresh and clean. To this end, each is
-P-A-G-E-524

140, 
  500 Educational Extension 
enclosed in a neat pasteboard case. Branches of the 
library are to be found on many railroad trains and 
steamboat lines, and prove of great convenience to the 
travelling public, since a volume drawn from one branch 
may be returned at any other, and another drawn in its 
place. 
In connection with the Booklover’s Library is the 
Tabard Inn Library, having many more centres for 
exchange, but lacking the home delivery feature. Mem- 
bership in the latter is less expensive than in the former. 
We cannot doubt that both these libraries, though pri- 
marily commercial in their inception, are important fac- 
tors in general library extension. They are perhaps the 
strongest evidences we have that books must be both 
attractive and easily accessible to be widely circulated.

CHAPTER XXV 
NEWSPAPERS AND PERIODICALS 
a. NEWSPAPERS 
PoweERrFUL as is the library as a factor in educational 
extension, we must in all probability give first place to 
the public press. It would be hard to determine in any 
definite and precise way, the magnitude of its influence, 
but it is safe to say that in shaping public opinion, if 
not in furnishing the food for intellectual progress, it 
had more to do than has any other influence. Dr. W. 
T. Harris, in an address before the Congregational Club, 
in Washington, has said: — 
“Far surpassing our libraries in educative influences are our own 
daily newspapers and magazines. Our people are far more freely 
supplied with newspapers than are the people of any other nation. 
We are governed by public opinion, as ascertained and expressed in 
the newspapers to such an extent that our civilization is justly to be 
called a newspaper civilization.” 
Like all our great social and institutional growths, 
the newspaper has its beginnings far back in colonial 
days. Not so far as the public school, yet antedating 
the public library. In respect to age, indeed, our own 
public press is not so very far behind that of Europe. 
Depending, as it does, upon the printing press, it was 
impossible before the time of that invention, and even 
then was forced to wait until an appetite for news had 
been created. So it was probably not until 1622 that 
the first regularly printed sheet appeared in England, 
and eighty years later (1702) that a daily paper was 
started.

In the colonies, the first newspaper issued was in 1690, 
at Boston. Its publication was, however, declared con- 
trary to law by the colonial legislature, since it was 
charged with containing “reflections of a very high 
nature,” and a second issue was never made. So far as 
is known, but one copy is in existence, and that is in the 
state paper office in London. It is a small sheet of four 
quarto pages, one of them blank. 
The next essay into the newspaper field was more 
successful. On the 24th of April, 1704, appeared in 
the same city, Zhe Boston News Letter, edited by the 
postmaster, John Campbell; and since its sole prede- 
cessor did not live to draw its second breath, this may well 
be considered the parent of the American public press. 
It was a half sheet, twelve inches by eight. It con- 
tinued to be issued weekly until 1776. Until 1719 the 
News Letter had the entire field in the colonies, but in 
that year two other papers made their appearance, The 
Boston Gazette and The American Weekly Mercury, of 
Philadelphia, the former being printed, though not con- 
trolled, by James Franklin, elder brother of Benjamin. 
It was continued for many years, finally falling a victim 
to the Stamp Act. In 1721, James Franklin severed 
his connection with the Gazette and established The 
New England Courant, the third paper in Boston, and 
it was in connection with this sheet that his brother 
Benjamin got his first taste of letters. Of his connec- 
tion with it J. G. Palfrey says: — 
“But the master spirit of the Courant’s better days was Frank- 
lin’s brother Benjamin, then a boy apprenticed in the office. The 
paper provoked the severe displeasure of the clergy and the govern- 
ment, which the latter did not fail to manifest in process of legisla- 
ture and judicial action. All this might have continued, with good 
management and a portion of the favor, to brave or evade and thrive 
upon, but Franklin was indiscreet enough to quarrel with his brother, 
and with his elopement to Philadelphia the glory departed from the 
Courant, and its weak life soon expired.”

In addition to the papers already mentioned, there 
were established in Boston, previous to 1750, three 
others: The Weekly Rehearsal, The Weekly Post Boy 
(1734), and Zhe Independent Advertiser (1748). In the 
other colonies there had been meanwhile enough others 
started to bring the number up to that of the original 
states — thirteen — though their distribution was not by 
any means of the same breadth. Philadelphia had, be- 
sides The Weekly Mercury, The Pennsylvania Gazette, 
purchased by Benjamin Franklin, in 1729, a year after 
its establishment, and published by him for thirty years. 
In Newport, Rhode Island, was The Rhode Island 
Gazette, started in 1732; Annapolis had The Maryland 
Gazette (1728); and Charleston, South Carolina, Zhe 
South Carolina Gazette (1731). These, and two or three 
others of an ephemeral type, constituted the entire news 
circulation of the colonies at the middle of the eighteenth 
century ; and no one of these wasa daily. Such a thing, 
in fact, was hardly dreamed of, and did not make its 
appearance until 1784, in Philadelphia, with the issuing 
of The Pennsylvania Packet, subsequently called The 
Daily Advertiser, and printed under that name until 
1837. 
It would be out of place to discuss here in detail the 
development of the newspaper press later than 1750. 
From that time on its growth was much more rapid, as 
is shown by the accompanying table : —

Neither in 1750 nor 1775 was there a single daily 
paper published in the colonies. In 1820 there were 
27 dailies and an annual issue of 22,321,000 copies. 
In 1828 the latter had increased to 68,117,796; and in 
1871 to 1,499,922,219. j 
The earlier papers were ordinarily printed on a half : 
sheet, folded either once or twice, though with no great 
uniformity in this respect. Occasionally, when there 
was a press of news, the modern supplement was antici- 
pated by the use of an entire sheet. Although adver- 
tisements were inserted, they were not frequent. One 
appeared in the first issue of the Mews Letter and two 
in the second. This paper contained from time to time 
some interesting intimations that the editor of that day 
had troubles not unlike those of his modern prototype. 
In one of the issues of the year 1709 we find the follow- 
ing editorial dun : — 
“ All persons in town or country are hereby desired now to pay or 
send it in with their resolution that they would have it continued and 
proceeded on the fifth year, life permitted,” 
and later, the outline of an artful advertising scheme 
which would put to shame even the most up-to-date 
business manager of a modern sheet. It should be re- 
membered that the editor was also postmaster. He 
says :— 
“Tf he does not print a sheet every other week this winter time, 
he plans to make it up in the spring when ships do arrive from 
Great Britain. And for the advantage of the postoffice, an entire 
sheet of paper, one half with the news and the other half, good writing 
paper to write on, may also be had there for every one that pleases to 
have it every Monday.” 
6. MaGAziInes 
For many years these old papers of the earlier eigh- 
teenth century served the double purpose of news 
carrier, and the more dignified medium for discussion of
-P-A-G-E-532

the graver, philosophical, religious, and political ques- 
tions. In the course of time, however, a differentiation 
took place. Some of those already established took on 
more nearly the character, though not the form, of the 
modern magazine, and became less ephemeral in their 
nature. As early, too, as 1743, there appeared quite a 
pretentious publication of more than fifty octavo pages, 
under the title of Zhe American Magazine and Histori- 
cal Chronicle which was issued monthly at Boston for 
more than three years. In 1758, in the same city, was 
born The New England Magazine of Knowledge and 
Pleasure, sixty pages 12mo, which in spite of its poetical 
advertisement, or perhaps, because of it, failed to sur- 
vive its fourth monthly number.t 
During the twenty-five years preceding 1775 no less 
than six similar essays into the magazine field, mostly 
at Philadelphia, proved abortive; but in that year, The 
Pennsylvania Magazine, edited by Robert Aiken, got a 
foothold, largely through the contributions of Thomas 
Paine. If we may believe the editor, the problems of 
the sanctum were hardly less complicated in those days 
Palfrey, p.202, than they are at present. He explains that on one 
occasion, being ready to issue, and out of copy, he in- 
duced Paine to accompany him home. 
“T seated him at the table,” he says, “ with the necessary apparatus 
which always included a glass and a decanter of brandy. The first 
glass put him in a train of thinking ; I feared the second glass would 
disqualify him or render him untractable; but it only illuminated his 
intellectual system ; and when he had swallowed the third glass he 
wrote with great rapidity, intelligence, and precision; and his ideas 
appeared to flow faster than he could commit them to paper. What 
he penned from the inspiration of brandy, was perfectly fit for the 
press without any correction or alteration.” 
  But even this method seems not to have given his 
magazine sufficient strength to weather the storms of

the Revolutionary period, and it went under, together 
with every one of its contemporaries on this side of the 
water. 
The nineteenth century opened more auspiciously. 
Within its first decade began the growth of periodical 
literature, which has meant much to us as a people. 
The first, and perhaps the only one of that decade to 
have any considerable influence upon the literary tastes 
of the country, was Zhe Portfolio, published by Dennie, 
in Philadelphia, from 1801 till 1825. In 1815 we have 
the birth of Zhe North American Review, the first of all 
our list which is anything more than a myth to the pres- 
ent generation. For many years it was published in Bos- 
ton as a quarterly, but later it was moved to New York 
City and has, since 1819, appeared as a monthly. It 
has had in its editorial chair in succession Tudor (its 
founder), Channing, Dana, Everett, Sparks, H. H. Ever- 
ett, Palfrey, Bowen, Peabody, Lowell, Norton, Henry 
Adams, A. T. Rice. With such leaders of thought 
at its head, it is not strange that it ranks as probably 
first among American periodicals in its influence upon 
American thought. 
A close second to The North American Review, if in- 
deed we should give it second place, is Zhe Atlantic 
Monthly, founded in Boston in 1857, and ever since pub- 
lished there. First edited by James Russell Lowell, and 
followed by James T. Fields, William D. Howells, 
Thomas Bailey Aldrich, and having as regular con- 
tributors such men as Longfellow, Holmes, Emerson, 
Whittier, Trowbridge, and nearly every other man of 
prominence in American letters, it met with immediate 
recognition, and has maintained its high standard to the 
present time. 
During the first half of the century many other maga- 
zines of more or less temporary renown had made their 
appearance. Notable among these was Zhe Casket, 
published in Philadelphia from 1821 to 1839, and con-
-P-A-G-E-534
Appendix L, 510 Educational Extension 
tinued as Graham’s Magazine till 1850; The Gentle- 
man's Magazine, also from Philadelphia, 1837-1840; 
The Dial, the organ of the transcendentalists in Boston 
from 1821 to 1844; and The Knickerbocker Magazine in 
New York, established in 1832. Harpers Magazine, 
established in New York in 1850, was the first periodi- 
cal in America to make illustrated articles a regular 
feature. It has had much to do with the tremendous 
advance of the last half-century in the methods of book 
and magazine illustration. Beginning at a time when the 
uncouth wood-cut was the only picture made use of, its 
files furnish a most complete record of every step, to a 
stage of perfection which, by common consent, makes 
our American magazines the best illustrated in the 
world. Aside from its pictures, Harper's Magazine is in 
the front rank of the more popular literary periodicals. 
In 1871 Scribner's Magazine appeared as a competitor 
to Harper's along the same lines. On the death of its 
first editor, J. G. Holland, in 1881, its name was changed 
to the Century, which we know to-day as one of our 
leading magazines. 
Within the last quarter-century so many magazines 
of merit have been established as to make impossible 
any discussion of them within the limits set for this 
work. In 1903 there were in all 15,129 weekly publica- 
tions; 281 semi-monthly ; 2824 monthly ; and 163 quar- 
terly, issued in the United States. 
Scientific Magazines 
Specialization was for many years a slow movement 
in the case of American periodicals, and it was not until 
1818 that we had a scientific journal. In that year The 
American Journal of Science was first issued at New 
Haven, Connecticut, under the editorship of the elder 
Silliman. For fifty years it practically had the field to 
itself, and served for the publication of the scientific
-P-A-G-E-535
  
Newspapers and Periodicals 511 
productions of the country. In 1867 the American 
Naturalist made its appearance; and five years later, 
Appleton’s Popular Science Monthly (now the Popular 
Science Monthly). In 1883 Science was established, a 
weekly publication of greatest value in the field of gen- 
eral science. 
The Scientific American, also weekly, first published 
in 1846, should not be omitted from any list of general 
scientific journals of wide influence. Although it pub- 
lishes few, if any, lengthy scientific papers, it has prob- 
ably done more for the lay reader than has any one of 
the others mentioned, unless it be the Popular Science 
Monthly. 
An important move by our public press, hardly 
noticeable more than a decade ago, is that of publishing 
regular courses of study, and special articles with a 
direct educational purpose. This represents a stage in 
journalism at which an important educational factor be- 
comes conscious that it is such, and plans, in a definite 
manner, to increase its influence. It makes education 
one of its aims, rather than a mere by-product, as it had 
formerly been. 
Although the more pretentious magazines are partici- 
pating in the move, it seems to be the daily and weekly 
newspapers that are making the most of it. Of the 
latter, a great majority of the better class discuss regu- 
larly the Sunday school lessons, and not a few have 
special departments devoted to literature, art, music, and 
science. 
The most elaborate attempt which has yet been made 
to give a'direct educational value to the daily paper is 
through “ The Home Study Circle” established in 1897, 
by Dr. Seymour Eaton of the Drexel Institute. Under its 
direction, two or three columns of some of the principal 
daily papers of Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati, Buffalo, 
Pittsburg, Louisville, Memphis, Minneapolis, St. Louis, 
Denver, Los Angeles, besides many smaller cities, are, A.A. A.S

or have been, devoted to regular courses of study pre- 
pared by some of the leading thinkers of the country. 
Nearly one hundred separate courses have been offered 
under the direction of the Circle, and it has been 
conservatively estimated that more than one hundred 
thousand people follow the work, either closely or 
incidentally. 
The form and style of presentation have been direct 
and simple, making it possible for any person of aver- 
age intelligence to follow it. Although such work can- 
not be considered as in any way an equivalent of proper 
study done under the immediate personal influence of a 
competent instructor, it is, nevertheless, not to be ignored 
in any catalogue of our educational forces.

CHAPTER XXVI 
SUMMER SCHOOLS 
Tue summer schools of our country are a growth of 
the present generation, and are the natural and logical 
result of conditions which have only come with the 
later years of our history. The most fundamental of 
these is the long summer vacation, for summer instruc- 
tion is essentially vacational—and the summer vaca- 
tion enjoyed to-day by so many is not a very ancient 
institution: next important as a factor which has given 
rise to the summer school is the increasing desire on 
the part of the people to utilize to the best advantage 
the leisure time, which changing social conditions have 
left at their disposal; and a third which has undoubtedly 
been an influencing factor in summer instruction at the 
colleges and universities, is the desire to have the great 
educational plants used all the year round, and not a 
part of the year only. Such being the conditions, and 
the feelings of the people, the educational machinery 
was certain to adapt itself to them, and the present 
heterogeneous mass of institutions for summer instruc- 
tion was the result, as indigenous to the soil as is our 
indian corn, and nearly as prolific. The varying needs 
of many classes of people have given rise to institutions 
of many types. Dr. Stephen B. Weeks classifies them 
as follows: — 
(1) Schools that teach only a single branch of knowl- 
edge; as ancient and modern languages, religion, phi- 
losophy, library economy, natural sciences, etc. 
(2) Schools of the arts; as drawing, industrial art, 
manual training, music, oratory, etc.

(3) Professional, normal, or schools of methods, where 
the training of teachers is the main idea— summer 
schools of pedagogy. 
(4) General; where all or nearly all the subjects of 
the school curriculum are treated, and where the idea 
of study is combined with that of rest and recreation. 
(5) Summer sessions at colleges and universities. 
Again from the standpoint of control and mainte- 
nance they may be divided into several classes: — 
(1) Private, including all schools maintained wholly 
by fees or tuitions paid by the students; or by endow- 
ment made especially for carrying on summer work. 
This class includes by far the greater number of sum- 
mer schools, varying from the modest coaching estab- 
lishment, to Chautauqua and the great national summer 
schools. 
(2) College or university, which are usually general 
in their character. 
(3) State, which are generally devoted to the training 
of teachers, and include the so-called teachers’ institutes 
of all kinds. 
In the matter of fees, they range all the way from 
those asking a sufficient sum to place the institution 
upon a paying financial basis, to the state schools, which 
are usually free, or practically so. 
The variation in length of session is as great as that 
of fee, in some cases being but a week or even less, 
while in others covering ,the whole three summer 
months. 
These various institutions have before them the task 
of providing instruction : — 
(1) For those persons who are desirous of adding to 
their intellectual attainments, but are otherwise unable 
to obtain professional assistance in their studies. The 
instruction, when it has this end, is generally popular 
in its character, and limited to those subjects in which
-P-A-G-E-539
    
Summer Schools 515 
instruction of a fairly satisfactory character can be 
obtained without the necessity of a prolonged and con- 
tinuous effort; and in which the advantages of summer 
study can be supplemented by reading pursued during 
the rest of the year. Schools especially intended for 
this class of students usually restrict their courses to 
such subjects as literature, history, physical training, 
elocution, etc. In these schools, too, the element of 
recreation is an important one. The various Chautauqua 
assemblies and popular schools at summer resorts belong 
to this class. ; 
(2) For undergraduate college students and others 
seriously working for an academic degree. Many such 
students are thus enabled to save time in gaining aca- 
demic distinction, and others to gain such distinction 
which would otherwise be impossible. The schools of 
this class are usually directly associated with some 
degree-conferring institution. 
(3) For students pursuing some definite branch of 
instruction, but unable because of local peculiarities 
or geographical difficulties to carry on the work de- 
sired. The seaside and lakeside laboratories, as well 
as schools for geological study and surveying, located 
especially for those ends, belong to this class. 
(4) For teachers, who wish to place themselves in 
line for promotion by devoting their time to general 
pedagogical study or to academic subjects closely asso- 
ciated. In this class of schools the element of inspira- 
tion is an important one. In them teachers of all 
classes, from the college to the kindergarten, meet and 
profitably exchange experiences, doing much to help 
each other out of the ruts into which the teacher is 
prone to fall. The Martha’s Vineyard Summer Institute 
is a type of this class of school, at which 80 per cent 
or more, of all in attendance, are teachers. 
In treating in detail some of the more important sum- 
mer schools of the past and present, I shall roughly 
follow the first classification given above,

1. SCHOOLS AT WHICH BUT A SINGLE BRANCH IS TAUGHT 
a. Biological Sciences 
This class of schools, though not so numerous to-day 
as some of the others, was the first to enter the field. 
The principal vazson ad’ étre, especially of those of science, 
has been some particularly favorable geographical loca- 
tion. As may be seen from the table on page 538, in 
the rapid increase in the number of institutions for 
summer work from 1890 to 1896 and the srsequent 
decline in numbers, schools of this class have much 
more than maintained their proportion of the whole, 
being 13 per cent in 1893, and 21 per cent in 1900. 
Such schools originated as circles for investigation, 
with instruction only an incident to the other more im- 
portant feature. As early as 1869 a group of profess- 
ors and advanced students, mostly from the scientific 
schools of Harvard, made a trip to Colorado for the 
purpose of investigation ; and during the next four years 
groups of students under Professor Marsh and other 
Yale instructors made similar excursions, carrying on 
scientific investigations of much value and collecting 
material which is deposited in the Museum of Natural 
History at New Haven. It was also the custom at 
about this time for Professor Orton, of Vassar College, 
to spend a part of each summer with a number of his 
students in different places of geographical interest; 
but these instances of educational instruction, though 
of much real value, can hardly be dignified with the 
title of Summer Schools. 
It remained for Louis Agassiz, the great teacher and 
naturalist of Harvard University to take the next step, — 
in collaboration with his colleague Dr. N. S. Shaler, —by 
the establishment of the Anderson School, on Penikese 
Island. We can hardly overestimate the influence of 
this school, short-lived though it was, upon the develop-
-P-A-G-E-541
Summer Schools 517 
ment of scientific thought in our country; and since it 
was the first American summer school, it is deserving 
of more than passing mention. 
It was first opened in the summer of 1873, with forty- 
three students in attendance. 
For years Agassiz had been convinced that if any real 
advance was to be made in the biological sciences, it 
must be through the study of the lower forms of marine 
life, and that to study them successfully one must do 
more than make an occasional collecting excursion to the 
seaside. He believed that nothing less than a seaside 
laboratory, where the investigator might spend at least 
the summer months in residence, would answer the pur- 
pose, and he set about to secure such a laboratory. His 
first thought was that the island of Nantucket would be 
the most suitable place for such an enterprise, and even 
at the time of issuing his first printed announcement, ex- 
pected to hold the session there. The Massachusetts 
legislature, however, after urgent appeal, devoted the 
little island of Penikese—one of the westernmost of 
the Elizabeth islands, south of Buzzards Bay and about 
halfway from Woods Holl, Massachusetts, and New- 
port, Rhode Island—to the purpose. 
Through the generosity of Mr. John Anderson of 
New York City, Agassiz was able to erect a large, though 
cheaply built structure, for laboratory and dormitory pur- 
poses, and the dream of his later years was fulfilled. 
The prospectus of the first session contains the names 
of many men since famous as biologists, and shows the 
character of the work attempted. But for one summer, 
and one summer only, was the great naturalist the visi- 
ble inspiration of the laboratory at Penikese. Before 
the next he had died, and although the laboratory was 
kept open under the direction of his son, Alexander 
Agassiz, the genial, moving spirit was gone, and at the 
end of that season the whole project was abandoned. 
Of the man himself, but a word is necessary: As a

naturalist, Professor Agassiz was untiring in his devo- 
tion to his favorite pursuits. He worked early and late, 
often denying himself the most necessary rest and recre- 
ation, and his remarkably strong constitution sustained 
him under a strain that would have quickly proved fatal 
to a man of less vigor. His mind was preéminently 
great. Gifted with a wonderfully retentive memory, he 
combined with it a power of generalization and quick 
perception that places him next to Cuvier, whose dis- 
ciple he was, and whom he seemed to imitate. In his 
methods of investigation he was thoroughly honest, and 
though many might differ from him in his conclusions, 
none could deny the absolute integrity of his convictions. 
In his intercourse with his fellow-men he was extremely 
affable and genial, and especially so to the young. With 
inexperience he was most patient and painstaking, never 
wearying in his efforts to aid. 
Tolerant of ignorance when associated with modesty, 
he had little patience with arrogance and ignorance com- 
bined. His students will all bear witness to the unvary- 
ing cheerfulness and ready sympathy in him they had 
learned to look up to as their master. 
Of his last summer at the Penikese Zhe Natton said, 
editorially : — 
“ Professor Agassiz himself worked as he always does, hard and 
almost uninterruptedly: in fact too hard for his health. He was 
almost constantly in the laboratory encouraging and aiding alike the 
students and the other teachers, or spending hours in elucidating 
points in the structure of animals which he had studied all his life : 
and he lectured nearly every day, at times even twice a day, for he 
attended every lecture given by others, and at its close, or even in 
its course, would rise to add a word of confirmation or doubt and, as 
upon several occasions, would continue for half an hour upon matter 
suggested by the lecture. In fact nothing could be more genial than 
the intercourse between the respected chief and all connected with 
the school. From what has been said it will be seen that the enumer- 
ation of Agassiz’s subjects would not be easy. A series of admirable 
lectures upon glaciers, embodying much that has never been pub- 
lished, and a course upon radiates, and a third upon the egg, formed
-P-A-G-E-543
Summer Schools 519 
nuclei, around which were grouped discourses upon general topics 
and special questions such as were never before brought within the 
same time. And when it is to be remembered that the school opened 
July 8 and the last student departed August 28, and that during 
these seven weeks, Professor Agassiz was absent less than one week, 
it will be evident that when he asked codperation of others he did 
not mean to rest content with directing their labors: but it is to be 
hoped that another year he may be willing to give himself more of 
the rest he so sadly needs.” (Written three months before Agassiz’s 
death.) 
Although the laboratory itself at Penikese was but 
short-lived, the spirit which actuated it still survives in 
a considerable line of descendants. Of these, the one 
most closely related is, perhaps, Professor Alexander 
Agassiz’s laboratory established in Newport, Rhode 
Island, in 1877. Although elaborately appointed for 
work in biological investigation, it is private, and since 
but very few students are admitted, and those only under 
special terms, it can hardly be legitimately classed 
among the summer schools of the country. In 1879 a 
summer school of biology was established at Salem by 
the Peabody Academy of Science, but after holding five 
sessions, was discontinued, Another early revival of 
the Penikese idea was the Chesapeake Zoological Labo- 
ratory of the Johns Hopkins University. This has been 
essentially migratory in its nature, the first two sessions 
(1878-1879) being held at Fort Wood, an artificial island 
of some six acres in extent, situated in Chesapeake Bay, 
near Hampton Roads; the next five or six, for the most 
part at Beaufort, North Carolina; and then, after a few 
years’ discontinuance for want of financial support, was 
reorganized in 1891. Since its beginning this school has 
been under the direction of Dr. W. K. Brooks of Johns 
Hopkins, and its contributions to science contain many 
of the strongest papers ever prepared by American 
investigators. 
It was not until 1881 that facilities were offered to 
others than trained investigators or advanced students at
-P-A-G-E-544
    520 Lducational Extension 
any of the summer laboratories. During that summer 
and a few succeeding ones, a laboratory was conducted 
at Annisquam, Massachusetts, at which elementary 
work was offered. It was supported in part by the 
Boston Society of Natural History, and in part by the 
Women’s Educational Association of the same city. 
These societies, after having conducted the Annis- 
quam Laboratory successfully for six years, felt that 
they were warranted in calling upon the patrons of 
science for financial aid in support of larger things, and 
in 1888, through a combination of interests, The Marine 
Biological Laboratory was established at Woods Holl, 
Massachusetts, and the work at Annisquam discon- 
tinued. Since that time the laboratory at Woods Holl 
has been the leading summer biological workshop of the 
country. The buildings are large, commodious, and 
adequately equipped, while a steam launch and row- 
boats are kept constantly in service for collecting 
purposes. Private rooms in the laboratory building, 
furnished with aquaria and other apparatus, are provided 
for investigators of repute free of charge. Both ad- 
vanced and elementary instruction are provided in gen- 
eral laboratories, and students may spend nearly the 
entire three summer months at the laboratory upon 
special arrangement, though the instruction is for but 
six weeks. General evening lectures are of frequent 
occurrence, and on the whole, the laboratory has done 
invaluable service to the cause of biological instruction 
and investigation in our country. 
During the last decade and a little more, many ad- 
mirable summer schools of science, similar to those 
which we have discussed, have sprung up wherever con- 
ditions seemed to be especially favorable for scientific 
investigation. Of these, the Brooklyn Institute Biologi- 
cal Laboratory, founded at Cold Spring Harbor in 1890, 
is among the best. From the beginning, instruction 
has been given in elementary zoology and botany, com-
-P-A-G-E-545
Summer Schools 521 
parative embryology and bacteriology, although the 
laboratory by no means neglects the side of original 
investigation. At South Harpswell, Maine, and in the 
Blue Hills of Milton, Massachusetts, modest centres for 
biological study have been started. In Rhode Island a 
summer school for nature study has been maintained 
since 1899 at Kingston. In the Middle West, the 
University of Illinois conducted a freshwater labora- 
tory at its biological station on the Illinois River for 
two or three seasons, and the University of Indiana has 
maintained a similar laboratory at Winona Lake, Indi- 
ana, since 1890. Still farther west, the State University 
of Montana established a biological station at Big Forks 
in 1899, and on the Pacific coast, the Hopkins Seaside 
Laboratory has been open for students since 1892. 
6. Philosophy 
Another early summer school of the class giving in- 
struction in a single subject, of much importance in its 
day because of the eminent men associated with it was 
the Concord Summer School of Philosophy, established 
in 1879 at Concord, Massachusetts, under the direction 
of Mr. Bronson Alcott. There were associated with 
him in the work Mr. S. H. Emery, B. F. Sanborn, 
Dr. W. T. Harris, Dr. B. F. Jones, Ralph Waldo Emer- 
son, Thomas Wentworth Higginson, Benjamin Pierce, 
Thomas Davidson, Noah Porter, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, 
and a whole galaxy of other notables. Ten sessions 
were held, the work being discontinued upon the death 
of Mr. Alcott; but during its life the school stood for 
the highest type of extra-university instruction. 
The following paragraph shows the importance of 
the task to which the school devoted itself. 
« Exactly what we are about, what is the value of our civilization, 
and toward what ideals we are working, are things not so clear as 
they might be, and there is great need of keener analysis and more

  522 Educational Extension 
careful thinkers to prevent our drifting blindly — to prevent, that is, 
not by obstructive conservatism, but by progressive comprehension. 
To educate for this purpose, then, is another object of the school. 
In order to know what to teach and what to receive we must seek 
through philosophy the one central principle on which the world — 
the universe—rests. Then we have to trace this back again from 
that, through all its manifestations in religion, governments, litera- 
ture, art, science, and manners. This is manifestly a large job, and 
the Concord School does not expect to carry it out so that it will 
never have to be done again, but rather to set people in the right 
path, so that they can keep on doing it forever. At a time when 
Germany is overpowered by the influence of Mill, Spencer, and 
Darwin, and the genius of materialism is getting so strong a hold 
everywhere, it is interesting to find that the Concord School reasserts 
with breadth and penetration the supremacy of the mind. . . . But 
it must not be supposed that the school is hostile to science; on the 
contrary, it approves and heartily sympathizes with it in its great 
work, which, properly regarded, it considers tributary to the highest 
ends of existence.” 
After the closing of the Concord Summer School, 
Mr. Thomas Davidson, the well-known philosopher and 
educational interpreter, took up the idea, and for some 
years conducted a similar school at Farmington, Connec- 
ticut. Later he removed it to the little village of Glen- 
more, in the heart of the Adirondacks. The scope was 
finally somewhat broadened, and covered the whole field 
of the culture sciences. The aim was stated as both 
scientific and practical. 
“The former it seeks to reach by means of lectures on the theory 
and history of the culture science, and by classes, conversations, and 
carefully directed private study. The latter it endeavors to reach by 
encouraging its members to conduct their lives in accordance with 
the highest ascertained ethical laws, to strive after ‘plain living and 
high thinking, to discipline themselves in simplicity, kindliness, 
thoughtfulness, helpfulness, regularity, and promptness.’” 
For the single session of 1892 there were, among other 
lecturers at this school, Hon. W. T. Harris, Thomas 
Davidson, Professor Josiah Royce, John Dewey, and 
J. Clarke Murray. The school is not now in existence.
-P-A-G-E-547
  Summer Schools 523 
The School of Applied Ethics at Plymouth, Massa- 
chusetts, started in 1892, was similar in character to the 
last two mentioned. Professor Felix Adler of New York 
City was its organizer and first director. The main pur- 
pose of the school was the promotion of historical and 
scientific study in those branches of knowledge which 
relate to human conduct. During the three sessions of 
the school—for that of 1895 was its last—there were 
present as lecturers among others the now presidents 
Wilson of Princeton, Wheeler of California, Andrews of 
Nebraska, and Wright of Clark College; Albert Shaw 
of the Review of Reviews, Professors Giddings, Burgess, 
Smith, and Jackson of Columbia, Jencks of Cornell, and 
Taussig of Harvard. 
The school was a success to the end, and at the close 
of its last session it was fully expected to resume the 
work the next season; but circumstances arose which 
made that seem unwise. 
Of a nature somewhat similar to these schools of phi- 
losophy was the Monsalvat School of Comparative Reli- 
gion, established at Eliot, Maine, in the summer of 1896, 
at which the history of religious beliefs, both Oriental 
and Occidental, was made a special object of study. The 
school was discontinued in 1901. 
Important among the summer gatherings of religious 
students is the Northfield Summer Conference for col- 
lege students, first called together in 1886 by Dr. Moody, 
the evangelist, at his home at Mt. Vernon, Massachu- 
setts. On that occasion more than 250 students, repre- 
senting 225 different institutions, met to spend a part of 
their vacation in the study of the Bible and of practical 
methods in Christian work. The place has become 
memorable as the birthplace of the student volunteer 
movement for foreign missions. Much of the time of 
those in attendance at the conference is spent in athletic 
pursuits, although regular courses of lectures are given, 
as well as special addresses upon many phases of reli- 
 
-P-A-G-E-548

524 Educational Extension 
gious work. The work at Northfield proved of so much 
value that similar summer institutes have been started 
in other parts of the country; that at Lake Geneva in 
1888 and another at Knoxville, Tennessee, in 1892. 
Through platform addresses, Bible-class sessions, con- 
ferences for the consideration of special topics, and in- 
formal discussions, the following ends are sought: 
“Promotion of more thorough Bible study, both on the 
part of the individual student and in class work; develop- 
ment of a more effective form of organized Christian 
work in colleges and universities; training of picked 
men who shall be qualified to be leaders in such organi- 
zations.” In connection with the Lake Geneva Confer- 
ence is held the Y. M. C. A. Secretarial Institute and 
Training School. 
c. Languages 
The Sauveur Summer College of Languages was the 
first of its kind to be established in this country, and is, 
according to its founder, “the parent and prototype of 
all the schools of the same order that have since 
been established.” The first session was held at Ply- 
mouth, New Hampshire, in 1876; those from 1877 to 
1883 at Amherst, Massachusetts, where it has held 
sessions, with the exception of one or two summers, 
ever since. It is the aim of the school to supply the 
wants of the following classes : — 
First: American teachers of foreign languages who 
wish to gain hints and suggestions on the best methods 
of teaching those languages. 
Second: Professional and business men and women 
who would like to devote a brief vacation to the study 
of the humanities. 
Third: Students who desire to begin the study of a 
language, or to make up deficiencies, or to gain a greater 
familiarity with languages.  
-P-A-G-E-549
Summer Schools 525 
Although the work of the school is primarily linguis- 
tic, other branches are offered. In 1895 the school was 
joined with the Amherst College Summer School. For 
four years, beginning with 1887, there was a so-called 
Berlitz Summer School of Languages held at Asbury 
Park, New Jersey, with a faculty of a dozen or more. 
Beyond these there have been no attempts, more than 
local in their character, to maintain summer schools de- 
voted exclusively to the languages. 
d. Library Science 
Although special summer instruction in library science 
has been offered in the Amherst College Summer School 
by the librarian, Mr. W. I. Fletcher, continuously since 
1891, and at the summer session of the State University 
of Wisconsin since 1895, it was not until 1896 that a 
summer school was established devoted entirely to the 
needs of the library. This was at Albany, New York, 
in connection with the New York State Library. Mel- 
vil Dewey is its director. The session is six weeks in 
length, and the subjects offered include cataloguing and 
the classification of books, practical work in the refer- 
ence and loan departments, bookbinding and library 
economy. 
Summer courses in library science were offered in the 
Ohio State University in 1898 ; at Chautauqua Lake and 
in the University of Iowa since 1901; and by the Indi- 
ana Public Library commission at Indianapolis begin- 
ning with 1902. 
2. SCHOOLS OF THE ARTS 
Such subjects as art, music, oratory, and the various 
esthetic handicrafts were found to adapt themselves 
readily to the conditions of summer work, and schools 
of this class were early in the field, though never in
-P-A-G-E-550
  526 Educational Extension 
large numbers. Among the first was the Lexington 
(Massachusetts) Normal Music School. This school, 
established in 1883, soon had a national reputation. 
The School of Expression, founded at Martha’s Vine- 
yard three years later, and with subsequent sessions in 
Boston, Saratoga Springs, Lancaster (Massachusetts), 
and Newport (Rhode Island), was also very successful 
with its work. Vocal training, phonology and articula- 
tion, vocal expression, physical training, pantomimic 
expression, extemporaneous speaking, public reading, 
methods of training the voice, vocal expression, the 
history of pedagogy in its relation to expression, as well 
as the study of various English classics, formed the 
basis of its courses. 
The Boston School of Oratory, for special instruction 
in the synthetic philosophy of expression held a summer 
session in 1890. 
The Monroe College of Oratory, also of Boston, which 
held a summer session in 1887, was later merged with 
the Martha’s Vineyard Summer Institute, and bears the 
name of the Emerson School of Oratory. In 1900 
there were nine summer schools coming under this 
class. 
3. SCHOOLS oF PEDAGOGICAL METHODS 
Since school-teachers, as a rule, are more certain of a 
long summer vacation than are any other classes of in- 
tellectual workers, the summer schools early found them 
their most numerous and enthusiastic patrons. Ques- 
tions having to do with the theory and practice of teach- 
ing are of such a character, too, as to admit of profitable 
discussion under summer school conditions, and a very 
large and increasing proportion of our public school 
teachers are spending at least an occasional summer 
in study. 
The proportion of summer institutions which are 
especially catering to their needs is very rapidly in- 
 
-P-A-G-E-551
  Summer Schools 527 
creasing. The table given later in this chapter shows 
that in 1893 but six per cent of the centres for summer 
study laid the principal stress upon pedagogical courses, 
while in 1900 the percentage was nineteen, with a steady 
and gradual increase from one to the other. These 
figures do not include county and other institutes for 
teachers, required by the laws of the various states. 
Among the summer schools catering principally to 
the needs of the teachers, the Martha’s Vineyard 
Summer Institute ranks among the first, not only in 
point of time, but in the importance of its work. It 
must be placed second only to the great assemblies at 
Chautauqua in the breadth of its influence and in the 
number of students who have been in attendance. The 
school was started in the summer of 1878, and has con- 
tinued its work uninterruptedly ever since. 
The originator of the enterprise was Colonel Homer 
B. Sprague, at that time master of the Girl’s High School 
in Boston. In 1882 he was succeeded by Dr. W. J. 
Rolfe, the Shakespearian editor, and later by Dr. W. D. 
Morey. 
More than fifty courses of instruction have been 
offered during a single season. These may be roughly 
divided into (1) methods for elementary studies, (2) 
methods for secondary studies, (3) academic branches. 
Among the latter are the natural sciences, modern and 
ancient languages, mathematics, English literature, his- 
tory and civil government, vocal and instrumental music, 
drawing, painting, and sloyd. The school has several 
substantial buildings of its own, is incorporated under 
the laws of Massachusetts, and is, on the whole, one of 
the most substantial institutions for summer work in the 
country outside of the larger universities. During its 
history, nearly every educator of note in the country 
has appeared upon its platform, and the inspiration to 
the teachers in general from such a contact is incal- 
culable.
-P-A-G-E-552
  528 Educational Extension 
In the summer of 1885 there was founded at Sara- 
toga, New York, the National Summer School of 
Methods. Since the school at Martha’s Vineyard did 
not restrict its offerings solely to the needs of the 
teachers, this was the first distinct and special summer 
school of methods in the country, and grew out of the 
belief that many teachers, anxious to learn better 
methods, could improve their work by observing the 
work of others of long experience, and by studying the 
art of teaching under practical educators of national 
reputation. 
The faculty was made up of educational experts 
from all parts of the country. After three seasons, this 
school united with the one at Round Lake, and sessions 
were held at both places. In 1890 the two schools 
combined with a summer school for teachers at Glens 
Falls, where sessions were continued until 1897. 
Another similar institution for teachers of more than 
local influence was the Virginia Summer School of 
Methods, at Bedford, Virginia. The first of its seven or 
eight sessions was in 1888. The school was strictly 
pedagogic in its character, and the needs and capacities 
of all grades of teachers were considered. 
In addition to these more pretentious schools for 
pedagogical instruction, less important ones have sprung 
up in large numbers in every part of the country, many 
of them leading a precarious existence for a season or two, 
only to go under, or, as in some instances, to coalesce 
with some other institution. The state has, however, in 
many cases, recognizing the earnest desire on the part of 
the teaching force for good instruction during the sum- 
mer months, more- than made up for the depletion in 
the ranks of private schools of pedagogy by establishing 
summer sessions at the state normal schools, and also by 
improving the character of the work done at the county 
institutes for teachers. 
Of these two methods of state instruction during the  
-P-A-G-E-553
  
Summer Schools 529 
summer months, the former would undoubtedly be the 
more efficient, if generally carried out. At present, 
scarcely more than a dozen public normal schools have 
a summer session, but as is the case’ with the state 
universities, the feeling is growing that the valuable 
equipment should not lie idle for a third of the year, 
and without doubt the number doing so will rapidly 
decrease. 
Where summer work is carried on, it does not vary 
materially from that of the regular school year. 
The first teachers’ institute —so called —was held by 
J. S. Denman, superintendent of schools for Tompkins 
County, New York, in 1843, lasting two weeks. During 
the activity of Horace Mann in Massachusetts they 
flourished, and his writings upon the subject are 
among his most interesting contributions to educational 
literature. : 
4. SUMMER SCHOOLS HAVING A GENERAL COURSE 
This class of schools has been from the beginning 
by far the most numerous. The table on page 538 
shows that in 1893 76 per cent of all the schools tabu- 
lated were within it. Although their proportion is 
decreasing, in 1900 more than one-half of the whole 
number in the field gave courses of a general nature. 
In the table already alluded to, this class of schools has 
been subdivided into three groups: First, Private and 
proprietary schools other than the Chautauqua; second, 
Chautauqua; third, General summer sessions at colleges 
and universities. : 
The relative distribution of these three groups within 
the class has changed materially within the last four 
years, the tendency being away from the usually poorly 
organized and equipped omnibus summer assemblies, 
and in the direction of the summer facilities offered by 
the colleges and universities. In 1893, 39 per cent of 
2M N. Y. School

  530 Educational Extension 
the summer schools were in general of the former type, 
while but 10 per cent were in the field seven years later. 
Meanwhile, at the beginning of the same period, the col- 
leges furnished but 8 per cent of the summer institutions 
for study, ending it with 24 per cent in 1900. This 
readjustment means much. Not necessarily that the 
former type did not occupy a field of usefulness, for 
no one can question that they did, but that they have, 
as a class, served as appetizers to large numbers of per- 
sons who could not satisfy their intellectual hunger upon 
the viands provided, and have moved on to better fur- 
nished tables. They have, in fact, created a demand 
which will in the end be supplied almost entirely through 
the summer sessions of old, established institutions. 
The summer school has found itself and has come down 
to business. There are, however, among the survivors 
of this class of summer schools, some relatively ancient 
and certainly honorable institutions, while equally as 
worthy have fallen by the wayside. Among the sur- 
vivors of prominence to-day is the Catholic Summer 
School of America. This school owes its origin to a 
demand on the part of Catholics for an institution simi- 
lar to Chautauqua, where busy men and women might 
find opportunity for needed improvement either by sum- 
mer assemblies or courses of winter reading. The first 
session was held at New London, Connecticut, in 1892. 
In 1893 the organization was incorporated under the 
‘laws of New York, and what has to-day the aspect of a 
permanent and valuable centre of summer work estab- 
lished at Plattsburg, New York, on the shores of Lake 
Champlain. The school enjoys all the privileges granted 
to any institution by the University of the State of New 
York, and is a part of its extension department. 
Besides the general literary courses, series of lectures 
are offered each year by men prominent in the Catholic 
church, upon religious topics. Meetings of the various 
societies of the church are also held during the session
-P-A-G-E-555
Summer Schools 531 
of the school. It is intended that the institution shall 
become the quasi parent of a great series of Catholic 
summer schools throughout the English-speaking world. 
To meet the demand for such institutions, Catholics of 
the West have established the Columbian Catholic Sum- 
mer School at Madison, Wisconsin; and another similar 
institution, meeting in the winter, holds its sessions at 
New Orleans, Louisiana. 
At Colorado Springs, Colorado, in 1892, a very prom- 
ising institution of the general type was started under 
the title of the Colorado Summer School of Science, 
Philosophy, and Languages. Situated as it was at the 
foot of Pike’s Peak, with every facility for associated 
outing, it attracted large numbers of people during the 
five or six years of its existence. It had as instructors 
and lecturers, Presidents Woodrow Wilson, E. B. An- 
drews, W. De Witt Hyde, William L. Slocum, and J. H. 
Baker. Professors William James, R. T. Ely, C. E. 
Bessey, E. W. Bemis, W. B. Rolfe, Katharine Lee Bates, 
‘Katharine Coman, W. D. Todd, and many others. 
Chautauqua 
The most elaborate organization offering summer 
“work in this country, if not the most comprehensive 
educational organism in the world, is that comprehended 
undér the Chautauqua movement. A variety of methods 
for the populayjzation of education are embraced by it/ 
The almost marvellous growth of the movement within 
a few years offers a striking example of what the econo- 
mists characterize as an “effective demand”’ for higher 
education. One writer has said : — 
“The ramifications of Chautauqua would stagger belief did we 
» not know stéam and electricity have developed the world into the 
round table of these latter days, and with their weaver’s shuttle laced 
together the thoughts of men. Chautauqua is a marvellous illustra- 
tion of the fact that often great social and economic forces flow with   
The New Eng.

  532 Educational Extension 
a tidal sweep over communities only half conscious of them. Its 
one hundred thousand registered students, half of whom are between 
the ages of thirty and forty years, and its practically endless courses, 
make the home college the realization of a World University, the 
summer assembly being its visible centre. About one in every 
thousand of the people of the United States owns the shibboleth 
Chautauqua, while more than one in every hundred visits its yearly 
gatherings. It exists in every state and territory of the Union.” 
Historically speaking, the whole movement is the out- 
growth of a religious camp-meeting which resolved itself 
into a Sunday School Assembly in the summer of 1874, 
at Chautauqua Lake, New York. 
The regular summer meetings have been held there 
during the months of July and August every year 
since. The Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle 
(C. L. S. C.) was organized in 1878, the summer college 
in 1879, and the correspondence college in 1885. The 
whole movement looks toward general culture, not spe- 
cial training. The following tabular statement of the 
Chautauqua system explains its many ramifications.

In each department the strongest men and women 
from every part of this country and abroad are secured, 
and nearly every one of eminence has been heard from 
- the Chautauqua platform. For years President William 
Harper of the University of Chicago was at the head 
of the whole movement, and later Bishop John H. Vin- 
cent has been the chancellor. Chautauqua degrees 
are given, and diplomas are granted those who have 
pursued certain courses of study for a series of years. 
The coérdinating instrument of the organization is The 
Chautauquan, a monthly magazine of much merit, which 
contains, in part, the required reading for those regu- 
larly registered and following the prescribed courses. 
An important feature of the Chautauqua movement is 
the system of branch assemblies which are held all over 
the country, and which follow as closely as may be the 
plan of the central meeting at Chautauqua Lake. In 
1900 there were sixty-six such assemblies, nearly every 
state in the Union being represented in the list. 
Prominent among them is the Jewish Chautauqua at 
Atlantic City, New Jersey. In it the study of Jewish lit-

erature and history is made a prominent feature, though 
the regular Chautauqua courses are offered. 
Summer Work at Colleges and Universities 
The rapid growth in numbers of the institutions, as 
well as students in attendance, would lead us to believe 
that here lies the hope of the future in the matter of 
summer instruction. It had its initiative at Harvard, 
if we may consider the earlier scientific attempts already 
mentioned in the chapter as coming within the meaning of 
the term “Summer School,” in 1868. Agassiz and his 
Penikese experiment, which was really under Harvard 
control, led to the establishment of scientific courses at 
Cambridge. Amherst was the next to take up summer 
work, through the Sauveur School of Languages in 
1876. A summer library school only, is now main- 
tained. In 1877 the University of Virginia established 
summer work in chemistry, and in 1895, in physical 
training. Nearly ten years elapsed after the first Vir- 
ginia experiment with summer work, before it found 
a place in other higher institutions of learning ; and then 
it was the Ohio Wesleyan University at Delaware, Ohio, 
that took it up. After this date (1886) its growth was 
comparatively rapid in the colleges and universities, 
as shown by the following table, which gives years of 
beginning in most of the institutions in which it is 
conducted.

This i not complete, owing to the inability to deter- 
mine in some cases the year of establishment of sum- 
mer work. It is, however, approximately correct, other 
colleges and universities now offering summer courses 
having begun them since 1900. 
In the universities of Chicago and West Virginia, 
the work of the year is practically continuous, being 
divided into four terms or “quarters,” one of which is 
in the summer. In all the others a comparatively short 
summer session is conducted, of from three to nine 
weeks, bearing no very intimate relation to the work 
of the remainder of the year. Usually not all depart- 
ments offer instruction, the selection being determined 
by local conditions, though pedagogical courses are fre- 
quently included. A tuition fee is charged even in the 
state universities, where instruction is free for the re- 
mainder of the year. 
Although the summer teaching force is largely made 
up of instructors from the regular faculty, and the stu- 
dent body to a considerable extent from the undergradu- 
ates, the custom is in vogue of popularizing the summer 
work by means of general lectures, either singly or in 
courses, thus giving, even to the summer sessions of our 
colleges and universities, some points of resemblance to 
schools of the Chautauqua type. Chicago and Cali- 
fornia have found this plan especially useful in building 
up an attendance, and it seems fully to meet the needs 
even of the most studious class of patrons. 
In the various bulletins of the Home Educational 
Department of the University of the State of New York 
are to be found the most complete statistics bearing 
upon summer schools, and from them we are able not 
only to determine at least approximately the number 
and character for any year of a considerable period of 
time, but also to note the trend. 
Blanks were sent out each year from 1893 to 1900 
by the summer school division, and the returns which
-P-A-G-E-561
  
Summer Schools 537 
would indicate roughly the number of schools being 
maintained were as follows :— 
Year, 1893 1894 1895 1896 1897 1898 1899 1900 
Schools, 10h 180. 159. 251 181} 106-118, ror 
A mere glance at these figures shows that there has 
been of recent years a rapid falling off in the number 
of institutions offering summer work. The climax 
came in 1896. Dr. Dewey, in discussing these facts 
says:— 
“More careful study shows that the apparent diminution is what 
we ought to expect and hope for, as the institution takes its place as 
a permanent factor in our educational system. By checking off the 
251 schools in the report for 1896 with the 105 for 1900, it will be 
‘seen that the disappearance from the list are largely those of camp- 
meetings and temporary experiments, made sometimes by well-mean- 
ing enthusiasts, sometimes more from commercial motives. Some 
of these did more harm than good, and their disappearance is itself 
again. Others served a temporary purpose in arousing public inter- 
est to a point where the strong endowed institutions were willing to 
take up the work. They were a cu/ture, as the bacteriologists would 
say, for a new idea, performing the same functions as the briars, pop- 
lars, and pinchberries do in the forest after a fire, making it possible 
for the valuable maple, birch, and beech to get a sound foothold in 
the soil.” 
In order to determine more specifically just what type 
of summer school has been worsted in the struggle for 
permanency and recognition, I went through all the 
figures in the various reports, and find the percentages 
of institutions of each of the general classes which have 
formed the basis of the discussion of this chapter, so 
far as any characterization is given, to be as follows for 
each of the years covered by the data: — Bul. 39, Home

This table has been referred to at various points in 
the chapter and need not be discussed here further than 
to say that it emphatically supports the above quotation. 
In 1893, 68 per cent of the summer schools were of 
the general or Chautauqua type, while in 1900 but 
27 per cent so characterized themselves. Meanwhile 
summer work offered at the colleges and universities 
had come up from 8 per cent of the whole number to 
24 per cent. The exact number of colleges reporting 
in the latter year was 26, in 14 of which the summer 
session is made one of the regular terms of the college 
year. In 12 it is connected with the institution, but its 
work forms no part of the regular course. 
In 1900, 17 summer schools gave certificates of at- 
tendance or statement of work done ; 37 gave certificate 
of proficiency or credit in the institution connected; 
10 gave diplomas; 9 issue no certificate or diploma. 
Financial support is wholly or in part from the fol- 
lowing sources: fees 55, state 20, endowment 3. 
Many have no special admission requirements; sev- 
eral say “ability to do the work.” In a few cases, the 
applicants must be teachers. In most of the higher 
institutions where the session is one of the regular 
terms, other than matriculated university students are
-P-A-G-E-563

admitted to the work, though only the latter receive 
credit.

of summer schools in 1900, together with decades of 
organization : — ‘

Of those of the Northeastern states, New York 
leads with 18, followed by Massachusetts with 15. In 
the Southern states, Virginia had 4 and North Carolina 
3. Of the North Central states, Illinois had 12, Ohio, 8, 
Michigan, 7, and Wisconsin, 6; in the West, Colorado 
claims 4, and on the Pacific coast 5 of the 6 were in 
California. 
Regarding the trend of summer work in this country, 
it seems safe to predict that the present tendency away 
from the disorganized, superficial, camp-meeting type, in 
the direction of the adequately equipped and main- 
tained institutions where intensive work of dignity 
and value can be carried on, will continue; and that 
with some, as is the case now in a few universities, the 
summer students will more than outrank in numbers 
those of the rest of the year. Such institutions must, 
however, be favorably located, as far as climate and 
other surroundings are concerned, for the element of 
recreation cannot be neglected. 
It is also probably true that the Chautauqua and 
its type of assemblies will continue to flourish; but
-P-A-G-E-564
  540 Educational Extension 
except for the mother institution at Chautauqua Lake, 
and a very few of the other better maintained assem- 
blies, the summer work will soon cease to figure educa- 
tionally, unless we use that word in its broadest possible 
meaning.

  CHAPTER XXVII 
EVENING AND CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOLS 
a. EVENING SCHOOLS 
Ir is impossible to say when evening schools had 
their origin in America. In a contract made with the 
schoolmaster of Flatbush, New York, in 1682, the 
“evening school” is mentioned ; but it is probable that 
allusion is made to the afternoon session of the school, 
which began at 1 p.m. It is certain, however, that in 
1773 evening schools were conducted as private ven- 
tures in Salem, Massachusetts, especially for instruc- 
tion in the mariner’s art, although some poor boys were 
taught to “cypher and to write.” It would be strange, 
too, if similar schools had not existed in other places as 
modifications of the tutorial plan of instruction which 
was common; but if so, we have no record of them. 
The beginning of the public evening school movement 
of the present day, which has spread to every part of 
the country and is represented by nearly one thousand 
separate schools and more than two hundred thousand 
pupils, was at Louisville, Kentucky. What seems to 
have been the first evening school in the country in any 
way connected with public education, or having any bear- 
ing upon its subsequent development, was opened there 
upon the first Monday in November, 1834, in the base- 
ment of one of the city school buildings, and continued 
in session for four months. It had two teachers, both 
connected with the day schools, and twenty-two boys as 
pupils. The school was continued for another year 
under practically the same conditions, the enrolment 
541 Appendix A,
-P-A-G-E-566

Jour. 19: 439. 542 Educational Extension 
being twenty-four boys, most of whom were apprentices 
in the shops of the city. From that year (1836) until 
after the Civil War, evening schools were only occasion- 
ally opened in Louisville, and then, if the meagreness of 
attendance is any measure, without much success. Since 
1882 there has been no discontinuance of the work. 
The next evening school to be established in the. 
country seems to have been a benevolent enterprise, 
though the only information I can gain regarding it is 
from Martin’s Evolution of the Massachusetts Schools, 
page 218, in which is the statement : — 
“In connection with the philanthropic work of the Warren St. 
Chapel in Boston seems to have been the first evening school in this 
country, with two pupils.” 
In 1848, the city of Worcester, Massachusetts, estab- 
lished free evening schools, which have been continued 
ever since, marking what may be considered the begin- 
ning of their successful operation in the country. The 
example there set was followed but slowly by other 
cities, for in 1868 the following statement was made by 
Henry Barnard :— 
“ Evening or night schools in elementary branches for pupils over 
fifteen years of age and in several cities, under special conditions to 
be determined by the school board, for pupils under fifteen, are 
provided as a part of the system of public instruction in Chicago, 
Brooklyn, New York, Lowell, Newark, New Orleans, Providence, 
Salem, San Francisco, and St. Louis. 
As has been shown, Worcester had them previous to 
this time ; and, since they were established in Scranton, 
Pennsylvania, in 1866, and in Philadelphia and Cam- 
bridge, Massachusetts, in 1868, it is evident that Dr. 
Barnard’s statement does not cover all instances. We 
may therefore presume that the work had been begun 
in other cities. 
The instruction was generally of an elementary 
character, though the evening high school of New
-P-A-G-E-567
  Evening and Correspondence Schools 543 
York, established previous to 1867, was an exception. 
In this school, grammar, reading, declamation, penman- 
ship, arithmetic, bookkeeping, algebra, geometry, trigo- 
nometry, natural philosophy, chemistry, astronomy, his- 
tory, and political science were taught. 
In 1877, eight evening schools were in operation in 
Baltimore, though they were not continued throughout 
the winter. In the same year, those in Albany were 
reported to “have proved almost an entire failure.” In 
Boston, one evening high school was in operation with 
1100 pupils, and 16 elementary schools, besides 6 of draw- 
ing. New York City was maintaining 222 evening classes 
with 19,802 pupils enrolled. Since of those who en- 
tered, 1111 could not read, and 1374 could not write, the 
elementary character of the work is evident. In Cincin- 
nati there was one evening high school and 15 element- 
ary schools, with 60 teachers, while Chicago had one high 
school and 7 elementary schools. The course in the 
former, in addition to the common branches, included 
mechanical drawing, bookkeeping, and stenography. 
St. Louis had in the same year 34 evening schools, and 
San Francisco, 13. 
In 1881 evening schools were in operation in 32 cities, 
those in Boston having reached an enrolment of about 
2500 pupils. The curriculum had broadened, drawing 
was made much of, and several courses in stenography 
introduced. In 1890, 808 separate evening schools were 
in operation in 165 cities and towns, the enrolment being 
150,770. 
Of these schools Philadelphia had 54; New York (and 
Brooklyn), 43; Chicago, 38 ; Cleveland, 38 ; Scranton, 32; 
Pittsburg, 24; Boston, 22; and Lawrence, Massachu- 
setts, 20. 
For later years it is impossible to tell how many public 
evening schools are in operation, except in cities of 8000 
inhabitants and over. In such, the number was 921 in 
1901, with a total of 5115 teachers and 203,000 pupils,
-P-A-G-E-568

544 Educational Extension 
121,886 of whom were males. The North Atlantic 
states are those in which the evening school movement 
has gained most headway, seven-ninths of the schools 
being in that region, and more than four-fifths of the 
pupils. In the South it is hardly yet under way, there 
being but 45 schools in all that region; and even in 
the North Central states, which lead in most classes of 
school statistics, there are less than 20,000 pupils in the 
evening schools. 
In most of the public evening schools the session is 
from seven till nine, for a period varying from twelve to 
twenty-four weeks, usually beginning early in October. 
In those of an elementary grade, instruction is given in 
all the common school branches from the A B C’s, up. 
In those cities where there is a rapidly increasing foreign 
population they are largely patronized by recent immi- 
grants, and the average age of the pupils far exceeds 
that for any grade of the day schools. 
Besides these publicly supported evening schools 
which form a part of the city school systems, there are 
in many cities evening schools upon private foundations, 
and those maintained by religious and philanthropic 
associations as well as schools of a professional and 
technical character. 
P. gor, To the former class belongs that of the Cooper Union 
in New York City, opened in 1859, which has been of 
inestimable value to thousands of students since. To 
the second class belongs the system of evening classes 
maintained in almost every great city of the country, 
by the Young Men’s Christian Association. To the last 
class belong evening schools of drawing and the fine 
arts as conducted by art leagues and museums of fine 
arts all over the country, as well as evening colleges of 
law, medicine, and pharmacy. As early as 1848 the 
P. 400. Maryland Institute of Art and Design opened its even- 
ing classes. And its example has been followed by 
others.

Evening and Correspondence Schools 545 
Along professional lines, twenty-seven schools of law 
now offer evening courses, while there are nine evening 
schools of pharmacy, six of medicine, and four of den- 
tistry. Altogether, there are probably three hundred 
thousand pupils in evening schools of all kinds through- 
out the country; not a large number when compared 
with those in the day schools, still an army of earnest 
workers not to be neglected in any review of educational 
forces. 
b. CORRESPONDENCE SCHOOLS 
Instruction through correspondence upon anything 
like a general plan had its origin in the Chautauqua 
movement. In the autumn of 1870, at the close of the 
session of the school of languages, a number of the stu- 
dents, wishing to continue their work through the winter 
months, prevailed upon their instructor to outline a course 
of study and direct them through the mails. For want 
of thorough organization, the plan did not prove a suc- 
cess, largely, no doubt, owing to the fact that no finan- 
cial contract was involved, the students undervaluing the 
importance of the direction which they were getting for 
nothing, and the instructors not feeling called upon to 
devote much time to gratuitous instruction. Two years 
later the plan was again taken up, this time upon the 
basis of a stipulated fee of $3 for each course taken. 
A director of correspondence work was appointed who 
should have direct supervision over it, seeing that some 
regularity of direction and reply was maintained; but 
this time, too, the plan failed, probably because the fees 
paid were too small to be an incentive to pupil or 
teacher. 
But the next year the defect was remedied; the fee 
raised to $10 for each course, and the custom adopted 
of sending out assignments of work at regular intervals, 
rather than waiting for a request for such, as had pre- 
2N
-P-A-G-E-570
  P. 531. 
Rep. Com. Ed, 
1902, I: 1076, 546 Educational Extension 
viously been the case. This plan proved successful. 
The interest of the students was maintained, and in 1883 
correspondence work was made the basis of instruction 
in the Chautauqua University, organized in 1883 and 
continued under that name until 1885, when the scope 
was broadened and the title changed to the College of 
Liberal Arts. Elaborate arrangements were made for 
the conduct of its work, and upon its faculty were en- 
rolled some of the most eminent educators of the coun- 
try. The fees in the college were $5 for matriculation 
and $10 for each course. This sum was not sufficient 
to defray the expenses connected with the work. Never- 
theless, it was continued with success for fifteen years, 
until 1900, when in a readjustment of the Chautauqua 
affairs, all correspondence work was dropped, thus end- 
ing the first successful attempt of the kind made in the 
country. 
Correspondence work, as it is now carried on, is of- 
fered by two distinctly different classes of institutions. 
First, colleges and universities which maintain it as a 
subordinate department of their regular instructional 
work; and second, correspondence schools pure and 
simple, which offer no courses for students in residence. 
Neither of these two classes is large; but the first is 
especially limited in numbers, largely, no doubt, owing 
to the lack of time to be devoted to the work on the part 
of their instructional force. It is true that in all insti- 
tutions where students are registered zz absentia, in- 
struction of a character analogous to that in the 
correspondence school is given; but this is usually of 
an extremely indefinite nature and can hardly be con- 
sidered under the head of correspondence courses. 
Some few have, however, in the past made, or are at 
present making, definite announcement of such work 
with the intent of attracting students to it. The state 
universities of Wisconsin and West Virginia, Taylor 
University at Upland, Indiana, and the Rhode Island
-P-A-G-E-571
  Evening and Correspondence Schools 547 
Agriculture College are among those which have tried 
the experiment and given it up. In but one of the great 
higher institutions of learning (the University of Chi- 
cago) are correspondence courses now emphasized. Im- 
pressed with the possibilities of the work during his 
connection with Chautauqua, President Harper early in- 
troduced it at Chicago and has given it complete organ- 
ization. Twenty-five separate courses were offered in 
1902 under the direction of 103 instructors. Among 
the subjects offered are philosophy, education, history 
and the political sciences, modern and ancient languages, 
mathematics, the biological sciences, and theology. The 
total number of students enrolled for the various years 
was as follows: 1892-1893, 93; 1893-1894, 209; 1894- 
1895, 31; 1895-1896, 481; 1896-1897, 641; 1897~1808, 
881; 1898-1899, 1015; 1899-1900, 1158; I900~1901, 
1311; I9QOI-1902, 1485. 
The Armour Institute, also in Chicago, is making an 
important feature of correspondence courses. 
In addition to these two Western institutions at least 
three others in various parts of the country mention 
correspondence courses in their catalogues. One of 
these, the Pennsylvania State College, confines its offer- 
ings, thirty in all, to agriculture and domestic science. 
Printed lesson sheets are used, and sent without tuition 
charge to all enrolled, each sheet being accompanied 
by questions which must be answered before another 
will be sent. College certificates in the following gen- 
eral subjects are granted upon the completion of a defi- 
nitely prescribed amount of work: general agriculture 
(nine courses), animal industry (seven courses), horticul- 
ture (four courses), dairying (six courses), and domestic 
science subjects (four courses). 
In 1897 Baylor University at Waco, Texas, first an- 
nounced correspondence courses. Two plans are fol- 
lowed: that of direction of the work by means of 
printed outlines as at Pennsylvania State College; and,
-P-A-G-E-572
  548 Educational Extension 
second, that of informal direction from time to time 
as occasion demands. Fees of from $10 to $12 are 
charged for courses, according to their character. 
The New England states seem to be represented 
in this class of correspondence work solely by the state 
normal school at Willimantic, Connecticut. Students 
doing the work are enrolled as non-resident; and any 
completing the course in a given subject are exempted 
from the examination in it for the state teachers’ cer- 
tificate. American history, botany, civil government, 
drawing, English, general history, geography, literature, 
mathematical geography, mineralogy, penmanship, and 
physics are the offerings. Sheets containing assign- 
ments of work are sent to the student, who does the 
required reading, and remails the completed lesson. 
This, accepted, is replaced by another. No course may 
be extended beyond a year. 
The second class of correspondence schools mentioned, 
that which conducts no residence work, is considerably 
larger than the first, although just how large, it is impos- 
sible to say, since many of them are extremely simple 
and informal in their character and not included in any 
list of educational institutions. In some instances they 
are nothing more than non-resident tutoring establish- 
ments of uncertain value and unfixed location, conducted 
by a single individual. No school within the class is 
maintained by the public, or even endowed, so far as I 
can discover, each being conducted as a business enter- 
prise, as are the private commercial schools. On the 
other hand, there is at least one school within the class 
having an instructional force of nearly four hundred, 
and an enrolment of more than three hundred and fifty 
thousand students within the first ten years of its 
existence. The real educational value of the work done 
by such schools has been a matter of debate among 
students of education. No one could be so impressed 
with its merits as to consider it the equivalent of study 
 
-P-A-G-E-573
  
Evening and Correspondence Schools 549 
done in residence at the better colleges and special 
schools; yet we must, it seems to me, recognize them 
as important factors in educational extension. Probably 
five hundred thousand persons, the greater number of 
whom are young men, have made use of the opportuni- 
ties which they offer within the last ten years, very few 
of whom would have done any systematic study except 
for them. Such facts are not to be disregarded in their 
educational bearing, and although there have been many 
“ get-wise-quick” schemes as well as “ get-rich-quick ” 
schemes exploited under the guise of correspondence 
schools, when all is said, we cannot deny that as a class 
they have been productive of much good. 
There were in 1900, twenty-five separate correspond- 
ence schools in operation in the United States. Of these, 
six were in New York State, seven in the other Eastern 
states, two in the Southern, and ten in those of the 
Middle West. In three the courses were largely theo- 
logical in their nature, in three primarily dealing with 
the fine arts, in four literary and linguistic, in three 
legal, in two engineering, while in the others a variety 
of subjects was given.

  CHAPTER XXVIII 
LEARNED SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS 
In 1743 Benjamin Franklin brought together a little 
circle of friends at an alehouse in Philadelphia and 
informally organized a society called The Junto, for the 
discussion of philosophic and scientific questions. In 
his autobiography he says: — 
“The rules that I drew up required that every member should in 
turn produce one or more queries on any point of morals, politics, or 
natural philosophy, to be discussed by the company, and once in 
three months produce and read an essay of his own writing on any 
subject he pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction of a 
president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of truth, without 
fondness for disputes, or desire of victory.” 
There were but six original members of The Junto, and 
its meetings were finally discontinued, without any of 
its ‘proceedings having been published. The interest 
which had been aroused by it was, however, directly 
responsible for the establishment, some years later, of 
The American Philosophical Society held at Philadelphia 
Sor Promoting Useful Knowledge, incorporated in 1780, 
which claims as the year of its birth that of the original 
Junto, 1743. Franklin was the first secretary, and 
afterward president up to the time of his death. This 
society, which is still in existence, may justly lay claim 
to being parent of the very numerous progeny of more 
than five hundred societies and associations of men and 
women, who meet at stated intervals for the discussion 
of problems in every field of human knowledge. Since 
many of their discussions are printed and accessible to 
the general reader, our learned societies and associa- 
oe  
-P-A-G-E-575
  Learned Societies and Associations 551 
tions are proving a veritable clearing-house of scientific 
thought, the value of which can hardly be overestimated. 
The evolution of these societies shows the same ten- 
dencies toward specialization that are noticeable in 
educational organizations. In The Junto, papers might 
be read upon any subject of the author’s choice. Even 
before the close of the eighteenth century, the few 
similar circles which had been organized turned their 
faces, either in the direction of general scientific prob- 
lems, or of historical discussion. With the growth of 
special professional classes having restricted interests, 
this differentiation went on, until now no line of thought 
is without its learned societies. 
All these, with very few exceptions, are voluntary in 
their nature, having arisen through the natural desire of 
persons whose interests are similar, to congregate. They 
have, with one exception, no connection with any branch 
of the national or state government. 
This exception is the National Academy of Sciences, 
which was established by act of Congress in 1863. It 
is, in a sense, the scientific advisory board of the national 
government, being required to investigate and report 
upon scientific questions as requested by Congress. In 
scientific circles it occupies in this country about the 
same position as does the Academy of Sciences in 
France, and the Royal Society in England, election to 
it being considered the highest honor attainable along 
scientific lines. Originally the membership was limited 
to fifty ; but in 1870 the limit was removed, and of late 
years four new members have been elected annually, 
giving a total number of nearly one hundred, selected 
from all branches of science. 
The headquarters of the Academy are in Washington, 
where a stated meeting is held annually. Although the 
government has but seldom made use of the Academy 
for scientific purposes, it has served as a valuable stimulus 
to scientific research throughout the country.

For purposes of study, the other learned societies and 
associations may be classified roughly under the following 
heads : — 
a. General scientific societies. 
&. Historical societies, and those of allied interests. 
c. Societies of natural history and the biological 
sciences. 
d. Associations for the study of special subjects. 
e. Professional associations. 
J. Teachers’ associations. 
The following table shows the number of existing 
societies and associations under these various heads, 
together with the decade of organization of each. It is

a. GENERAL SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES 
Of this class the oldest representative, except the 
American Philosophical Society already mentioned, is 
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences of Boston, 
Massachusetts, founded in 1780, largely through the 
influence of John Adams, and having among its charter
-P-A-G-E-577
Learned Societies and Associations 553 
members, John Hancock, Robert Treat Paine, and 
Joseph Willard. The stated object was “to promote 
and encourage the knowledge of antiquities in America, 
and of the natural history of the country, and to deter- 
mine the uses to which the various natural productions 
of the country may be applied; to promote and en- 
courage medical discoveries, mathematical disquisitions, 
philosophical inquiries and experiments, astronomical, 
meteorological, and geographical observations, and im- 
provements in agriculture, arts, manufacture, and com- 
merce, and, in fine, to cultivate every art and science 
which may tend to advance the interest, honor, dignity, 
and happiness of a free, independent, and virtuous 
people.” The academy has published many volumes 
of proceedings, and has a large library. 
The Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, organ- 
ized in 1799, was the next to follow. Timothy Dwight 
was its first president, with Noah Webster as secretary, 
and many notables of New Haven— among them, Gov- 
ernor Trumbull—as original members. This society 
has been maintained largely through the activity of 
members of the Yale faculty. 
In 1817 the Mew York Academy of Sciences was 
established. It was the first of a considerable number 
of societies in various cities to adopt the name “ Acad- 
emy of Science.” Four meetings are now held each 
month, from which have come voluminous reports. 
In Brooklyna similar society was established in 1823, 
known as the Brooklyn Academy of Arts and Sciences, 
and has been ever since very active in all lines of scien- 
tific work. No less than twenty-five sections, each repre- 
senting a particular field of thought, have been organized, 
each with special officers and programmes. The Albany 
Institute (1824) was next to be founded, with the Mary- 
land Academy of Sciences following in 1826, and the 
Delaware County Institute of Science (Media, Pennsyl- 
vania), in 1833.

The year 1848 saw the beginning of the Essex Insti- 
tute at Salem, Massachusetts, and the American Associ- 
ation for the Advancement of Science, the latter of which 
is probably the largest and most influential of the gen- 
eral science associations of our country. Its objects are 
“By periodical and migratory meetings, to promote intercourse 
between those who are cultivating science in different parts of our 
country; to give a stronger and more general impulse and more 
systematic direction to scientific research, and to procure for the 
labors of scientific men increased facilities and wider influence.” 
All these aims have been reached to an unusual ex- 
tent. Annual meetings have been held in various parts 
of the country, until 1900, in the summer time; since 
then, during the Christmas holidays. At these meet- 
ings several hundred members are usually in attendance, 
and a large number of papers are read before the sev- 
eral sections. The association has numbered among its 
presidents many of the leading scientists of the country. 
The monthly magazine Sczence is the organ of the asso- 
ciation, and is received by all its members. 
Within the class of general scientific societies are 
more than sixty representatives, nearly every state hav- 
ing one or more. Many of these are the direct result 
of the American Lyceum movement, being organized as 
continuations of local lyceums, and at about the time 
the latter were declining in influence. This accounts 
for the unusual number founded in the later decades of 
the nineteenth century, as shown by the table. 
6. HistoricaAL SoclETIES, AND THOSE OF ALLIED 
INTERESTS 
Associations of a purely historical nature were early 
in the field, the Massachusetts Historical Association 
having been founded in Boston in 1791. Its object was 
the study of the history of New England. Most other 
societies of this class interest themselves in the consid-
-P-A-G-E-579
  Learned Societies and Associations 555 
eration of historical matters connected with some par- 
ticular region. In 1804 the Mew York Historical Society 
was founded. In 1822 both Rhode Island and Maine 
founded similar associations, New Hampshire in 1823, 
and Connecticut in 1825. Nine other states have fol- 
lowed their examples. In a few, among them Wiscon- 
sin and Nebraska, the societies have official connection 
with the state government. 
In all, there are now upward of fifty separate histori- 
cal associations. Besides the state and city societies 
(more than fifty of the latter), a considerable number 
have to do with particular nationalities, as the Holland 
Soctety of New York (1885), and American Jewish His- 
torical Society (1902). Another class is denominational 
in its characteristics, as the American Congregational 
Society (Boston, 1853); and a much larger class is pri- 
marily memorial in its nature, though historical in a very 
valuable sense, since particular epochs in our national 
history are made the objects of study. The Pilgrim 
Society (Plymouth, 1820) and the Society of Colonial 
Wars, with branches in several states, illustrate this class, 
of which there are more than twenty members. 
The one national historical society, The American 
Historical Association, dates only from 1884. It is truly 
national in its character, since, pursuant to the act of 
Congress which established it, reports must be made 
annually to the government, through the Smithsonian 
Institution, concerning the condition of historical study 
in America. The society must also stand in readiness 
to make special investigations of any historical subject 
at the request of Congress. The headquarters of the 
society are in Washington. The character of the men 
composing its membership may be gatheréd from a 
mention of the names of its first board of officers. They 
were, president, Andrew D. White; vice-presidents, 
Justin Winsor and Charles Kendall Adams; secre- 
tary, Herbert B, Adams.
-P-A-G-E-580
  556 Educational Extension 
Among the societies closely allied to the historical, 
the American Antiquarian Society, national in its inter- 
ests, though with its collections and library in Worces- 
ter, Massachusetts, is the oldest, having been founded 
in 1812. It has published extensively over the signa- 
tures of many of the leaders in historical thought, who 
are among its members. 
In geography and geology the American Geographical 
Society of New York, founded in 1852, is the oldest of 
six similar societies, two of which are in Washington, 
two in San Francisco, and one in Rochester, New York. 
Ethnology is represented by the American Ethno- 
logical Soctety, organized in New York City in 1842; 
folklore, by the American Folklore Society (Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, 1888); archeology, by the Archeological 
Institute of America (New York, 1879). There are also 
a number of numismatic and philatelic societies in 
various parts of the country. 
¢. Societies oF NaturaLt History AND THE 
BIoLoGicaL SCIENCES 
This class numbers upwards of fifty societies, dis- 
tributed through every portion of our country. Many 
of them are general in their character, —the descendant 
of the American Lyceum, —while others confine their 
attention to narrow fields of study. 
Of them all, the Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila- 
delphia (1812) is the oldest, with the Providence (Rhode 
Island) Franklin Society (1821), the Boston Society of 
Natural History (1830), the Lyceum of Natural History of 
Williams College (1835), the Portland (Maine) Society 
Sor Natural History (1843), and the Worcester (Massa- 
chusetts) Matural History Society (1852), following in 
that order, all established for the general study of 
natural history. 
Quite generally, in connection with these societies, 
 
-P-A-G-E-581
  
Learned Societies and Associations 557 
museums were established, that of the Boston society 
having grown to large proportions. Membership did 
not presuppose any extended scientific knowledge; but 
simply an interest in the subjects to be considered. In 
connection with them, many of our leading scientists of 
to-day got their initial training. 
The oldest of the special associations having to do 
with biological branches is the American Entomological 
Society (1859), a national society which publishes some 
four hundred pages of proceedings annually. The Amer- 
ican Ornithologist’'s Union (1843) and the American 
Microscopical Society (1878) are also national societies 
of this class. The former publishes Zhe Auk. The 
American Society of Naturalists (1883) is another im- 
portant biological association which holds annual meet- 
ings, usually in connection with the American Association 
Sor the Advancement of Science. 
d@. ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE STUDY OF SPECIAL SUBJECTS 
Under this class I have placed mathematical, chem- 
ical, psychological, philosophical, economic, and lin- 
guistic societies. 
Of the. first, the American Mathematical Society 
(New York, 1888), with its Western branch, is the only 
important representative. 
In chemistry the American Chemical Society (Brook- 
lyn, New York, 1874), with its several branches, is the 
most important. 
The American Psychological Association (New York, 
1892), and the American Philosophical Association, each 
with Western branches, occupy their respective fields. 
In economics and allied branches the American Statis- 
tical Society is the oldest, having been established in 
Boston, in 1839, “to collect, pursue, and diffuse statis- 
tical information in the different departments of human 
knowledge.” It is national in its scope. The two soci-
-P-A-G-E-582
  558 Educational Extension 
eties within this field which are the most active along 
lines of social science are the American Economic Asso- 
ciation (Ithaca, New York, 1865) and the American 
Academy of Political and Social Science of Philadelphia 
(1889). Each has published extensively, though the 
latter, through its Avnals, a quarterly magazine, is one 
of the most prolific of all our learned societies. 
In the field of literature the American Oriental Society 
(New Haven, Connecticut, 1842) is the oldest, confining 
its attention to Asiatic and African languages and 
literature. 
The American Philological Association, founded in 
1869, comes next, with the Modern Language Associa- 
tion of America following in 1883. 
These comprise the more influential literary societies 
of more than local importance, though in all there are 
upwards of twenty-five. Of these, about one-third con- 
fine their studies to Shakespeare, and nearly as many to 
Browning. 
é. PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATIONS 
In the field of medicine the American Medical Asso- 
ciation is the leading representative (1847), and has 
proved an immense stimulus to medical research. It 
has a very large membership, including many of the 
leading physicians of the country. Annual meetings 
are held at different places, the full proceedings of 
which are published. A weekly journal, also, is issued 
by the association. 
The American Dental Association (1859) holds a simi- 
lar position in that branch of surgery. Of both these 
classes of associations there are many state and city 
representatives. 
In legal matters the American Bar Association (1878) 
is the leading society, with many others of a similar 
character, but of local influence, in the field.
-P-A-G-E-583
  
Learned Societies and Associations 559 
The profession of engineering in its various branches 
is represented by many strong and influential societies. 
The oldest of these is the Franklin Institute of the state 
of Pennsylvania, founded in 1824, for “the promotion of 
the mechanics arts.” During its entire history, it has 
issued a monthly report, the files of which contain 
many of the most important contributions to engineer- 
ing literature. 
The Maryland Institute for the Promotion of the 
Mechanics Arts (1826) was the next society of this 
class to be established. Its particular interests are in 
the direction of manufactures and the useful arts. 
The first evidence of differentiation into the special 
fields of engineering is shown by the organization of the 
Boston Society of Civil Engineers (1848), followed by a 
National Society in 1852. The American Institute of 
Mining Engineers was organized in 1871, of Mechanical 
Engineers in 1881, and of Electrical Engineers in 1884, 
though local societies in each of these branches had 
preceded them. They are all important societies, and 
publish voluminous reports. 
In the field of art the Pennsylvania Academy of the 
Fine Arts was established in 1804, and the Wazional 
Academy of Design in 1820. Each has exerted an impor- 
tant influence. 
The Architectural League of New York (1888) and 
the National Sculpture Society (New York, 1893), are 
young but flourishing societies. 
Jf. TEACHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS 
With the exception of certain of the historical and of 
the national history societies, associations of the classes 
so far discussed are for the most part patronized by the 
leaders of thought, the scholars within the various 
specialties. Although the latter are perhaps usually the 
leaders in the teachers’ associations, the bulk of the mem- 
’ P. 40r. 
 
-P-A-G-E-584

bership (and the membership is vast) is composed. of the 
rank and file of the teaching profession. It is, in fact, to 
such that the greatest good from such associations comes ; 
not so much through instruction and information along 
the lines of advanced educational method, as through in- 
spiration from the contact of minds interested in similar 
pursuits, even though those minds be but little better 
trained than their own. So, it has come about that 
American teachers flock to society and association meet- 
ings of all sorts, beyond all precedent in any other 
country, or in any other profession. A great proportion 
of our four hundred thousand and more teachers belong 
to one or more associations, the meetings of which they 
attend religiously. 
When teachers in this country began to meet more or 
less informally for mutual improvement, can hardly be 
determined with exactness; but it was undoubtedly long 
before any formal organization of sufficient dignity 
had been perfected to leave record of itself. So far 
as is known, the Middlesex County Association for the 
improvement of the common schools, organized at 
Middletown, Connecticut, is the oldest. The American 
Institute of Instruction was organized in 1830, and has 
had a long life of greatest usefulness. The oldest state 
organization is the Mew York State Teachers’ Associa- 
tion, founded in 1845, with the avowed purpose of promot- 
ing “the interests of public education and the elevation 
of the profession of teaching.” Other states, especially 
in the West, were not slow to follow the example set by 
New York. Illinois and Iowa both organized state asso- 
ciations in 1854, Virginia in 1861, Kentucky in 1865, 
Georgia in 1867; and to-day nearly every state in the 
Union has one or more such societies. All are con- 
ducted along practically the same lines; at least one 
annual meeting is held, this usually coming at the Christ- 
mas holidays; the programme is divided into several 
sectional meetings with one or two sessions only, reserved
-P-A-G-E-585
  Learned Societies and Associations 561 
for the general association meetings. Not infrequently, 
the greater part of three days is devoted to the meeting. 
The great national society of teachers, the Matéonal 
Educational Association, was organized under its present 
name in 1870; and since it is the largest, as well as per- 
haps the most influential organization of the kind in the 
world, it merits more than passing mention. 
The first call for a national meeting was sent out in 
1857, over the signatures of the presidents of a number 
of the state teachers’ associations, the American Asso- 
ciation for the Advancement of Education, and other 
influential societies of teachers. This call invited “all 
practical teachers in the North, South, East, and West, 
who are willing to unite in a general effort to promote 
the general welfare of our country by concentrating the 
wisdom and power of numerous minds, and by distribut- 
ing among all the accumulated experiences of all, who 
are ready to devote their energies, and their means to 
advance the dignity, respectability, and usefulness of. 
their calling, and who believe that.the time has come 
when the teachers of the nation should gather into one 
educational brotherhood.” Copies were sent to the 
officers and workers in the teachers’ associations of the 
whole country, asking for their codperation. Only ten 
presidents responded. In compliance with the call a 
number of teachers assembled in Philadelphia, on Au- 
gust 26, 1857, and the Mational Teachers’ Association 
was organized. 
The constitution provided for the government of the 
association by a board of directors elected at the annual 
meeting. This board was to consist of a large number. 
of councillors, one from each state, district, or territory, 
together with the president, secretary, treasurer, and 
twelve vice-presidents. It also became the practice, 
even from this early meeting, to appoint a large nomi- 
nating committee, consisting of one member from each 
state represented in the convention. 
20 
 
-P-A-G-E-586
  562 Educational Extension 
The directory of the newly formed association voted 
to meet at Cincinnati in August, 1858. Of the thirty- 
eight signers of the constitution at the time of its adop- 
tion, only five were present at the first annual meeting. 
At the Cleveland meeting in 1870, the name was 
changed from the National Teachers’ Association to the 
National Educational Association. The constitution was 
also amended at this meeting so as to admit the codpera- 
tion of two other educational associations, the ational 
Superintendents’ Organization, andthe American Normal 
Association. According to the terms of this amend- 
ment, other departments could be organized, and the 
Department of Higher Instruction, and the Depart- 
ment of Primary or Elementary Instruction were or- 
ganized immediately. These departments elected their 
own officers, and provided their own programmes for 
the annual meeting. Up to this time all the educational 
topics had been discussed before the whole association. 
Since then, each department holds its own meeting and 
discusses such topics as relate to its work. There are 
now, in all, eighteen different departments: Superinten- 
dence, Normal Schools, Elementary Education, Higher 
Education, Manual Training, Art Education, Kindergar- 
ten Education, Music Education, Secondary Education, 
Business Education, Child Study, Physical Education, 
Natural Science Instruction, School Administration, Li- 
brary Department, Education of Deaf, Blind, and Feeble- 
minded, Indian Education, and National Council of 
Education. 
The membership of the association is made up of 
annual members, who pay $2 a year; of life members, 
who pay $20; of life directors, who pay $100; and of 
perpetual directorships, which are usually secured by 
boards of education or associations through the payment 
of $100. There are three classes of annual members, 
active, associate, and corresponding. Teachers, and all 
who are actively associated with the management of edu- 
 
-P-A-G-E-587
  Learned Societies and Associations 563 
cational institutions, including libraries and periodicals, 
may become active members upon application indorsed 
by two active members, the payment of an enrolment 
fee of $2, and the annual dues for the current year. All 
others who pay an annual membership fee of $2 may 
become associate members. Eminent educators not 
residing in America may be elected by the directory to 
be corresponding members. The number of correspond- 
ing members cannot exceed fifty, according to the con- 
stitution, but the limit has never been reached. All life 
members and life directors are denominated active 
members, and enjoy all the powers and privileges 
of such members, without the payment of annual 
dues. The annual membership of the association is 
changeable, because of the migratory character of the 
meetings. 
A new movement was inaugurated in the association 
at the Saratoga meeting in 1892, by the appointment of 
the special Committee of Ten to investigate and report 
on the course of study for secondary schools. The com- 
mittee, after a preliminary discussion, organized confer- 
ences, each consisting of ten members, on the following 
subjects: Latin; Greek; English; other modern lan- 
guages; mathematics; physics, astronomy, and chem- 
istry ; natural history (biology, including zoology, botany, 
and physiology); history, civil government, and political _ 
economy; geography (physical geography, geology, and 
meteorology). The result was a report of nearly 250 
printed pages which has become an educational classic, 
and is one of the most valuable contributions ever made 
to the literature of education. 
In 1893 the Committee of Fifteen, on elementary 
education, was appointed. The members of the com- 
mittee were divided into three sub-committees — on the 
training of teachers; on the correlation of studies in 
elementary education ; and on the organization of city 
school systems. The report was presented to the De-
-P-A-G-E-588
  564 Educational Extension 
partment of Superintendence in 1895, and has proved 
of hardly less value than its predecessor. 
In 1895 the Committee of Twelve on Rural Schools 
was appointed by the council. Their report was made 
to the council in 1897, and published in the volume of 
proceedings of the Milwaukee meeting. The Committee 
of Twelve was divided into four sub-committees, and 
assigned the following topics for investigation and re- 
port: School Maintenance; Supervision; Supply of 
Teachers ; Instruction and Discipline. The reports of 
these sub-committees were adopted by the whole com- 
mittee at Chicago in 1896, and were published, together 
with an appendix containing reports from various per- 
sons connected with rural schools, in 1897. 
The Committee on College Entrance Requirements 
was appointed in 1895 ; that on Normal Schools in 1895 ; 
and that on the Relations of Public Libraries to Public 
Schools in 1898. These three committees reported at 
the Los Angeles meeting in 1899, and the reports are 
all included in the Los Angeles volume. 
The annual volume of proceedings embodies the re- 
sults of the work of the association from year to year, 
and is therefore its most important contribution. It 
has been the aim of the successive publication com- 
mittees to confine it to a single volume of one thousand 
pages. 
The association is now in a most prosperous condi- 
tion. More than thirty-two thousand members of all 
classes were in attendance at the Boston meeting in 
1903. A permanent salaried secretary is maintained, 
who devotes his whole time to its interests, and the 
association stands without a rival in influence and 
usefulness. 
The only other society of teachers in any way ap- 
proaching the National Educational Association in 
breadth of influence is the Southern Educational Asso- 
ciation, organized in 1890. Although comparatively
-P-A-G-E-589
  Learned Societies and Associations 565 
small, it is a power for much good throughout the 
South. 
In special departments of education a number of 
flourishing associations exist. Prominent among them 
is the Western Drawing Teachers’ Association (1893), 
and the American Manual Training Association (1896). 
The common interests of the college and secondary 
schools are subserved in various parts of the country by 
the Vew England Association of Colleges and Preparatory 
Schools (1885), the Association of Colleges and Prepara- 
tory Schools of the Middle States and Maryland, and the 
Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of the 
Middle West. 
About 1892 the National Herbart Society was organ- 
ized, with a limited membership, mostly composed of 
devotees to the Herbartian doctrines, which were at 
that time especially prominent in educational thought. 
The society held two meetings annually for some years, 
the proceedings of which were published in the form of 
year-books. Some very valuable papers appeared in 
‘this form. In 1gor the society was discontinued, but 
its membership was absorbed by the Wational Society 
Sor the Scientific Study of Education, organized in that 
year. This society practically continues the general 
plan of its predecessor, though with its field of discus- 
sion somewhat broadened. Papers for discussions at its 
meetings are prepared in advance, and distributed to 
the members. Its meetings are held in connection with 
those of the National Educational Association and of 
the Department of Superintendence of that association, 
which comes annually in February. This society is, 
perhaps, the most exclusively scientific of our educa- 
tional associations. 
Admission to the Learned Societies 
This varies greatly with the different societies. At 
one extreme stands the National Academy of Sciences, 
 
-P-A-G-E-590
  566 Educational Extension 
election to which is purely honorary, and reserved for 
the few of unusual achievement. As might be sup- 
posed, application for membership to the Academy 
would be a grave breach of decorum. It, however, 
stands practically alone in this respect, application to 
most of the others being in order; though eligibility 
usually presupposes some particular interest in the sub- 
ject covered by the society. In some instances, too, 
special accomplishment or position is a prerequisite. 
Only in certain of the patriotic societies, such as the 
Sons of the American Revolution, is ancestry the de- 
termining factor. Applications for membership must 
usually be made in writing, with the indorsement of one 
or more active members. The annual dues vary from 
a small sum — $1 or even less—to many times that 
amount, though for most of the purely literary and scien- 
tific associations the dues do not exceed $5 annually, 
though where extended publications are furnished the 
members, they are sometimes more than this amount. 
The Value of Learned Societies 
The greatest value of such associations comes, per- 
haps, through the printed proceedings of the meetings, 
and through the occasional or irregular publications of 
other material. This is truly enormous, amounting 
annually to something like fifty thousand printed pages. 
No specialist in any literary or scientific subject can 
keep abreast of the times without access to this material, 
and no library of any pretension can be without it. 
Of little less importance is the stimulus which comes 
from the meetings themselves. It is the unusual man 
or woman who can keep up a full head of intellectual 
steam for any length of time upon the fuel of the study 
alone. The mutual inspiration which comes from these 
gatherings is often little short of revivalistic in its influ- 
ence. Though the actual instruction which comes from
-P-A-G-E-591
  
Learned Societies and Associations 567 
the meetings themselves is probably exceeded by that 
from the printed proceedings, such is certainly not true 
of the inspiration, and this latter is not to be neglected. 
On the whole, it is probably true that no professional 
man can make the most of himself without the informa- 
tion or inspiration which comes from direct association 
with his fellow-specialists ; and the learned societies have 
done much to furnish opportunities for this association. 
Study Clubs 
Of quite a different character from the learned socie- 
ties, yet not to be neglected as factors in education, are 
the local associations of persons — largely of women — 
for the pursuance of certain lines of general or special 
study. Women’s clubs, and societies of every kind, 
except those purely social in their nature, come under 
this head. Hardly a city or town of any size in our 
land is without one or more such clubs, and in spite of 
the fact that they have been subjected to much ridicule, 
their educational value is not slight. In New York 
State they have been organized under the Home Educa- 
tion Department of the University of the State of New 
York, which furnishes books for study, travelling 
libraries, mounted pictures, and, in some instances, 
lanterns and lantern slides. In 1900 there were 391 
such study circles in the state, with a membership of 
many thousands; and averaging somewhat more than 
twenty meetings each during the year.

  CHAPTER XXIX 
LYCEUMS, POPULAR LECTURES, AND MUSEUMS 
Tue American Lyceum was a popular institution of 
immense educational influence, which flourished during 
the second and third quarter of the nineteenth century. 
It originated in a local society of thirty or forty farmers 
and mechanics, which met for study and mutual im- 
provement in the town of Milbury, Massachusetts, about 
1826. Their example was contagious, and within the 
next few years a dozen or more of the surrounding 
towns had formed similar circles, subsequently uniting 
to form the Worcester County Lyceum. 
The system spread rapidly throughout New England, 
then into New York; and by 1831, the date of the first 
national convention of lyceum workers, it had estab- 
lished itself in the South, and as far west as Jacksonville, 
Illinois, then practically the Western limit of civilization. 
In fact, so rapid had been the growth of the lyceum 
movement, that in 1831, according to the minutes of the 
convention, there were “not less than eight or ten hun- 
dred town lyceums, fifty or sixty county societies, and 
several state lyceums.” Such a rapid development 
seems almost incredible. 
According to the general constitution, the American 
Lyceum was “to favor the advancement of education, 
especially in the common schools, and the general 
diffusion of knowledge.” 
The organization was well worked out at the national 
conventions, which were held for many years, and con- 
sisted of: Ist, town, district, or village lyceums; 2d, 
county lyceums ; 3d, state lyceums; and 4th, the national

lyceum. Each had its proper officers, and representation 
in the higher organization. 
At various times, the national lyceum approved the 
following measures : —" 
1. Formation of a central cabinet or museum of 
natural history, by means of local contributions. 
2. A system of exchanges for local museums. 
Promotion of codperation between schools. 
Introduction of apparatus for illustrating lectures. 
Addition of vocal music to the school curriculum. 
Study of American history and constitutional OS 
ee 
law. 
7. Study of natural history. 
8. Town maps and local museums. 
9. Preservation of materials for local history. 
10. Uniform plan for keeping meteorological data. 
11. Beautifying the village scenery. 
12. Text-books for schools and tracts for the people. 
13. Travelling libraries. 
A mere glance at this list is enough to show that we 
have in this movement the forerunner and parent of 
many of our most valuable institutions to-day. The 
United States Weather Bureau, library extension, the 
museum of natural history, the scientific laboratory, free 
text-books, the village improvement society, all are there 
foreshadowed; and there can be little doubt that the 
National Educational Association, and the American 
Association for the Advancement of Science were both 
more or less directly the outgrowth of the lyceum 
movement. 
I cannot do better in attempting to describe the Amer- 
ican lyceum than to quote Herbert B. Adams. 
“The constitutional objects of the town lyceums were mutual 
improvement and the general diffusion of knowledge. The means 
for effecting these objects were meetings for reading, conversation,
-P-A-G-E-595
  
Lyceums, Popular Lectures, and Museums 571 
discussions, dissertations illustrating the sciences, or other exercises 
which should be thought expedient; a cabinet consisting of books; 
apparatus for illustrating the sciences; plants, minerals, and other 
natural or artificial productions. Annual membership was rated at 
$2; life membership at $20. Persons -under eighteen years of age 
could enjoy for $1 per annum all the privileges of the society, except 
voting. 
“Lyceum Proceedings. — These varied somewhat in different 
localities, but it was a very general custom to have weekly meetings, 
with alternate lectures and debates. Popular science was a favorite 
subject of public instruction, and no lyceum was properly equipped 
unless it possessed a so-called ‘ philosophical apparatus ’ for experi- 
ments in physics or natural philosophy. The favorite subjects of 
public discussion were practical and economic; for example, the 
tility of railroads, which came into vogue at the very time that 
lyceums and education were rising in popular favor. 
“Lectures and discussions were often extempore, but sometimes 
elaborated by local appointees and read from manuscript, with copi- 
ous citations from good authorities. Home talent and self-help were 
the life principles of a village or town lyceum. A community.which 
could not produce its own I lecturers and debaters could not support 
a good lyceum. It was a training’ School for adults, and many 
Americans received from it a decisive impulse toward public life. It 
fostered in no small degree that gift for public speaking for which 
Americans have long been famous. 
“Junior Members. —It is becoming necessary in country towns 
for the first class, or the oldest pupils in each of their schools, to 
become members of lyceums, not merely to witness the illustrations 
or other exercises performed by adults, but to take part in them, to 
which they have found themselves equal, greatly to the satisfaction 
and sometimes to the astonishment of their parents and other 
friends. 
“ Influence of the Community. — The village or town lyceum was 
a helpful and uplifting power for various classes in local society. 
‘Teachers are accommodated with the room, apparatus, specimens, 
books, etc., of lyceums for their mutual improvement in relation to 
their schools. Farmers and mechanics also have their special lyce- 
ums under the patronage of a general society. In the summer sea- 
son ladies’ lyceums are conducted, one afternoon in a week, under 
the same arrangement.’ Here are clearly foreshadowed the teachers’ 
associations, farmers’ institutes, and women’s clubs of more recent 
times.” 
Such was the American Lyceum in its palmy days. 
As time went on, the element of entertainment, which 
 
-P-A-G-E-596
  572 | Educational Extension 
had. always been present to a legitimate extent in the 
form of occasional lectures by men of renown from out- 
side the local circle, began to grow at the expense of 
mutual participation, and we have the last important 
stage, that of the popular lecture course. Valuable as 
this has been and is, it cannot compare in educational 
importance with that which preceded it. 
During the stirring years from 1860 to 1865, but little 
time was given to individual or community improvement, 
and the lyceum went down with most other forms of 
educational extension. When resuscitated, it was in a 
quite different form. Nearly every village in the North 
had considerable numbers of returned soldiers, in a way 
unfitted for immediate participation in community affairs, 
but in whom the excitement of war had developed tre- 
mendous appetites for entertainment. That want, the 
lyceum soon began to supply through the medium of 
popular lectures. Each lyceum was now eager to secure 
the best speakers from away, as it had formerly been 
to develop them from within. America had such to 
give, and the names of Eyerett, Emerson, Phillips, Cur- 
tis, Garrison, Sumner, Lowell, Hale, Taylor, Douglas, 
Gough, and Greeley were frequently seen upon the 
lyceum bills. Some of these speakers, in fact, devoted 
their entire time to the work. It is said that John B. 
Gough alone spoke no less than ninety six hundred 
“times to audiences numbering in the aggregate nine 
million. Women, too, proved themselves to be popular 
with lyceum audiences. Julia Ward Howe, Susan B. 
Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Anna Dickinson, 
and Mary A. Livermore, besides many others of lesser 
note, were always in demand. 
But the lyceum had not only by this time lost nearly 
every vestige of its former self, but in most places, even 
its name. It is true that the agency which provided 
speakers of almost any description and cost, was known 
as a lyceum bureau, but it bore no relation to the Amer-
-P-A-G-E-597
  Lyceums, Popular Lectures, and Museums 573 
ican Lyceum. The lectures were usually given in the 
various cities under the title of “Star Courses.” Early 
in the ’7o’s music began to figure prominently in them, 
with the famous Ole Bull as the first, and perhaps great- 
est success. Camilla Urso, another violin virtuoso, was 
popular, as were Clara Louise Kellogg, Emma Thursby, 
and Anna Louise Cary as vocalists. 
Since that time, both the lecture and the concert, as 
well as the author’s reading, have been popular, and 
practically all the larger towns and cities support courses 
which usually contain them all. 
What bids fair to rival the old American lyceum at 
its best in matters of instruction, though not in the 
important element of mutual participation, is the present 
popular lecture movement being conducted by the boards 
of education in some.of.our larger cities. 
Tithis, New York City has taken the lead, and a 
description of what is being done there will show the 
maximum of accomplishment in this line. 
The move originated in 1888 by an act of the New 
York legislature empowering the city of New York to 
expend public moneys to provide for lectures for the 
working men and women of the city. The board of 
education immediately appropriated $15,000 for the 
purpose, and from June 1 to April 1, 1889, 186 lectures 
were given in six different schoolhouses situated in the 
more densely populated portions of the city. The total 
attendance at these lectures was 22,149. So successful 
was the work considered, that more elaborate arrange- 
ments were made for the next winter, when 329 lectures 
were delivered, though with a total attendance but 
slightly larger than for the previous season. 
The next year the work was placed under the direc- 
tion of Dr. Henry M. Leipziger, who has since had it in 
charge, and to whom much of its extraordinary success 
is due. 
He immediately took steps for giving the lectures a 
 
-P-A-G-E-598
  574) Educational Extension 
wider advertisement ; secured a large corps of specialists 
to lecture upon popular subjects ; engaged suitable halls 
when the school buildings did not contain adequate 
rooms; provided lanterns and slides for projection, and 
in every way made the offerings attractive to the class 
of people for whom they were intended. The effect of 
all this was remarkable. 
The total number of lectures given each season since 
1890, together with the total number of persons in 
attendance, is as follows :—

These figures are for the Borough of Manhattan alone. 
Beginning with 1901-1902, lectures have been delivered 
in three other boroughs of greater New York — Brook- 
lyn, Queens, and Richmond. These gave an additional 
attendance of 342,342 for the first season, and 583,602 
for the second. 
These figures are stupendous, giving us a total at- 
tendance of nearly 7,000,000 for the fifteen years the 
lectures have been given. 
During the winter of 1902-1903 lecture. centres 
were maintained at fifty-five different points through- 
out the city, thirty-two of which were school build- 
ings. Among the others were the Cooper Union, 
Columbus Hall, American Museum of Natural His- 
tory, Young Men’s Hebrew Association, Harlem Young
-P-A-G-E-599
  Lyceums, Popular Lectures, and Museums 575 
Men’s Christian Association Hall, and the Hall of the 
Board of Education. Of the entire number of lectures 
for the season, 2911 were illustrated by means of the 
lantern, 267 by experiments, while 1043 were not illus- 
trated in any way. The general subjects covered by 
the lectures were: physiology and hygiene, including 
first aid to the injured, natural science, electricity, 
physics, chemistry, astronomy, sociology and kindred 
subjects, education, literature, history, biography, de- 
scriptive geography and travel, commercial geography, 
music, and art. Twelve lectures were given in Italian, 
eleven in Yiddish, and five in French. Of the free 
lecture course Dr. Leipziger has said :— 
“The free lecture system is a veritable godsend to a great city 
like ours. In sections where the poor dwell, what glad hours these 
lecture hours are. . . . What a delight to see a hall in the Bowery 
crowded with men, following, after a hard day’s work, a course in 
electricity ! What a pleasure to see in these halls, man and wife, 
brother and sister, meeting at the temple of learning, and having a 
wider horizon given, not only to the present, but the coming genera- 
tion. . .. It is the hope of all interested in this movement that it 
shall extend to all portions of our city, making the lecture centre a 
force that shall develop in the greater New York, loftier civic pride 
and nobler individual ideals.” 
In this matter of public lectures, supported by the 
city, New York has been practically alone. 
Many of the larger cities, and a few of the smaller 
ones, have provided occasional lectures, but nothing 
that in any way approximates the movement in New 
York City. The question of fuller utilization of the 
school buildings for general educational purposes is, 
however, being agitated in many places, and we may 
soon expect to see material results. 
In the city of Boston, public evening lectures main- 
tained by the board of education have been given occa- 
sionally for many years, but under no systematic plan 
until the season of 1901-1902, when forty special lec-
-P-A-G-E-600
  576 . Educational Extension 
tures were given in the evening schools. The speakers 
were all members of the teaching force of the city; and, 
except upon a few occasions, only the pupils of the 
evening schools were admitted. During the next winter 
(1902-1903), the plan was entirely changed, and the lec- 
tures were thrown open to the public. Fifty-six were 
given with almost phenomenal success, no less than 
40,000 persons being in attendance, or an average of 
715 at each lecture. The subjects were all of a literary 
character, or of travel, the scientific lines, along which 
New York City had been so successful, not having been 
followed. Much more elaborate preparations are being 
made for the future conduct of the work, and we can- 
not doubt that in Boston it will prove of the same great 
value as in the city of its origin. 
In Chicago, the University of Chicago has codperated 
with the board of education, and has given many public 
lectures, usually in courses, in the different school build- 
ings of the city. 
The board of education of Albany, New York, has, 
since 1894, maintained series of illustrated lectures, 
primarily for the pupils in the schools, but which are 
occasionally given in the evening to general audiences. 
In Syracuse, New York, two or three such lectures are 
provided for the public annually. In the winter of 
1902-1903, the city of Milwaukee offered the first 
course of public lectures under the auspices of the 
school board, and the plan is to be continued. Denver, 
Colorado, offered such courses during the winters of 
1897, 1898, 1899, but not since. 
Another great source of popular education through 
the public lecture plan is the University Extension move- 
ment. In the University of the State of New York, 
where it was begun in 1891, it is made to include much 
more than this (extension lectures, libraries, study clubs, 
and summer schools); but in higher institutions of an 
instructional nature, it is mainly through courses of
-P-A-G-E-601
    Lyceums, Popular Lectures, and Museums 577 
lectures given at various so-called extension centres, 
by members of the regular faculty. Many colleges 
and universities have undertaken the work, with varying 
degrees of success. 
At the University of Chicago nearly 150 members of 
the instructional force are connected with the extension 
division, and “centres”” have been established through- 
out the Middle West. 
The lectures are arranged in courses of six or 
twelve, travelling libraries, and other illustrative ma- 
terials are provided, and under some conditions univer- 
sity credit is given for attendance upon the work. 
In many of our larger cities the museums have made 
important contributions to public education through 
popular lectures, as well as in other ways. The centre 
of museum interest in the country is perhaps the Smith- 
sonian Institution of Washington. This was established 
through the bequest of about $500,000 made by Joseph 
Smithson, an Englishman, in 1829, but not available 
until 1838. As stated by the founder, the object of the 
institution was “to increase the diffusion of knowl- 
edge,” and most nobly is it serving its purpose. This 
is done largely through its publications, numbering 
nearly three hundred volumes of most valuable scien- 
tific material, though the popular lecture feature is not 
neglected. Its large museum, housed in a peculiarly pic- 
turesque building near the Capitol, and always open to 
the public, is now supported by the government. It has 
been of greatest service to the meteorological, the geo- 
logical, and the coast and geodetic bureaus, while that of 
ethnology is under the administration of the institution. 
The United States National Museum, with its collections 
in a building adjoining that of the Smithsonian Institu- 
tion, supplements the latter, through its immense mass 
of anthropological, geological, and biological material, 
relics of prehistoric man, aboriginal modes of living, 
the occupations, arts, and industries of native and foreign

races are exhibited in most instructive ways. Duplicate 
collections are frequently lent or given to local museums 
in various places, thus making the museum an educa- 
tional influence throughout the entire land. For the 
support of the museum, the government annually ap- 
propriates somewhat more than $200,000. 
The great scientific museum of New York City is the 
American Museum of Natural History, with an enor- 
mous collection, unparalleled in its arrangement; and 
with $75,000 each year to be devoted to the enlarge- 
ment of its collections, it is doing work second in im- 
portance only to that of the Smithsonian Institution. 
At this museum much is made of educational exten- 
sion. On Tuesday and Saturday evenings throughout 
the fall and winter, the museum, in codperation with 
the Department of Education of the city, offers, free 
to the public, a course of lectures on travel, geography, 
and natural science. Through Professor A. S. Bickmore 
(and under a grant from the state) it gives to the public 
school-teachers, on Saturday mornings during the winter, 
a series of lectures on geographical topics, illustrated by 
means of lantern slides. These lectures are repeated 
on legal holidays for the benefit of the general public. 
In codperation with various scientific societies of the city, 
—the Audubon and Linnzan societies, New York Acad- 
emy of Sciences, etc.,— the museum provides lectures on 
scientific subjects to which the public is always welcome. 
In order to bring about a more intimate relation between 
the museum and the school-teachers, the museum has 
prepared sets of birds, insects, and various invertebrates, 
which are loaned to the schools for periods of three 
weeks or more, to assist in the nature study work. 
Teachers and their classes are admitted to the museum 
at all times, and specimens are removed from the cases 
to classrooms in the building for special study. In addi- 
tion to the lectures above mentioned, the museum peri- 
odically coéperates with Columbia University in providing
-P-A-G-E-603
  Lyceums, Popular Lectures, and Museums 579 
lectures upon various scientific subjects, and has also 
very recently made an arrangement whereby public 
school-teachers may come to the museum and find a very 
large series of lantern slides which they are at liberty to 
use in the assembly rooms, for lectures given by them to 
their students. The museum is also doing an important 
work for the teachers of the state in distributing, through 
the Department of Public Instruction, various sets of 
lantern slides with accompanying lecture notes. 
The Field Columbian Museum of Chicago, established 
through the gifts of Marshall Field and other citizens of 
the city, was opened in 1894, in one of the buildings 
erected for the Columbian Exposition, Its growth has 
been rapid, and its collections are fast nearing the scope 
of the two museums already mentioned. About twenty 
popular lectures upon scientific subjects are given each 
year. 
Aside from these three, the only other museums of 
the country are maintained by scientific societies, educa- 
tional institutions, and by the various states. In most 
instances the latter are unimportant. Of the societies 
and associations, the Boston Society of Natural History, 
the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, and 
the San Francisco Academy of Sciences have large and 
valuable collections. At Harvard are the Agassiz Mu- 
seum of Comparative Zoology, and the Peabody Museum 
of Archeology and Ethnology, unsurpassed by those of 
any educational institution; and at Yale, the Peabody 
Museum, containing one of the most important paleonto- 
logical collections in the world. Many other colleges 
and universities have collections of considerable merit, 
and in some instances unsurpassed, in the value of ma- 
terial illustrative of local conditions. With our immense 
unstudied fields, we have every opportunity for scientific 
exploration and research, and museums in every quarter 
are being rapidly enriched. With the present tendency 
to utilize to its fullest extent every possible educational

agency, we may well expect that their importance to the 
people will be rapidly increased.

IMPORTANT COLONIAL SCHOOL ORDINANCES 
MASSACHUSETTS SCHOOL ORDINANCE OF 1642 
“This court, taking into consideration the great neglect of many 
parents and masters in training up their children in learning and 
labor, and other employments which may be profitable to the com- 
monwealth, do hereupon order and decree that in every town the 
chosen men appointed for managing the prudential affairs of the same 
shall henceforth stand charged with the care of the redress of this 
evil, so as they shall be sufficiently punished by fines for the neglect 
thereof upon presentment of the grand jury, or any other information 
or complaint in any court within this jurisdiction; and for this end 
they, or the greater number of them, shall have the power to take 
account from time to time of all parents and masters, and of their 
children, concerning their calling and employment of their children, 
especially of their ability to read and understand the principles of 
religion and the capital laws of this country, and to impose fines upon 
such as shall refuse to render such accounts to them when they shall 
be required ; and they shall have power, with consent of any court or 
the magistrate, to put forth apprentices the children of such as they 
shall [find] not to be able and fit to employ and bring them up. 
They shall take . . . employing them . . . up, nor shall take course 
to dispose of . . . themselves; and they are to take care of such as 
are set to keep cattle be set to some other employment withal, as 
spinning upon the rock, knitting, weaving tape, &c., and that boys 
and girls be not suffered to converse together, so as may occasion any 
wanton, dishonest, or immodest behaviour. And for their better 
performance of this trust committed to them, they may divide the 
town amongst them, appointing to every of the said townsmen a cer- 
tain number of families to have special oversight of. They are also 
to provide that a sufficient quantity of materials, as hemp, flax, etc., 
may be raised in their several townes, and tools and implements 
provided for working out the same; and for their assistance in this 
so needful and beneficial employment, if they meet with any difficulty 
or opposition which they cannot well master by their own power, they 
584
-P-A-G-E-609

may have recourse to some of the magistrates, who shall take such 
course for their help and encouragement as the occasion shall 
require according to justice; and the said townsmen, at the next 
court in those limits, after the end of their year, shall give a brief 
account in writing of their proceedings herein, provided that they 
have been so required by some court or magistrate a month at least 
before, and this order to continue for two years, and till the court 
shall take further order.” 
ea car SCHOOL ORDINANCE OF 1647) 
“It being one of the “chief projects of that old deluder Satan to 
keep men from the knowledge of the Scriptures, as in former times 
by keeping them in an unknown tongue, so in these latter times by 
persuading from the use of tongues, that so at least the true sense 
and meaning of the original might be clouded by false gloss is of 
saint-seeming deceivers, that learning may not be buried in the 
grave of our fathers in the church and commonwealth, the Lord 
assisting our endeavors : 
“It is therefore ordered, That every township in this jurisdiction, 
after the Lord hath increased them to the number of fifty house- 
holders, shall then forthwith appoint one within their town to teach 
all such children as shall resort to him to write and read, whose 
wages shall be paid either by the parents or masters of such children, 
or by the inhabitants in general, by way of supply, as the major part 
of those that order the prudentials of the town shall appoint: 
Provided, Those that send their children be not oppressed by paying 
much more than they can have them taught for in other towns; and 
“Tt is further ordered, That where any town shall increase to the 
number of one hundred families or householders, they shall set up a 
grammar school, the master thereof being able to instruct youth, so 
far as they may be fitted, for the university: Provided, That if any 
town neglect the performance hereof above one year, that every such 
town shall pay five pounds to the next school until they shall perform 
this order.” 
A DECLARATION CONCERNING THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING 
IN NEw ENGLAND BY THE GENERAL COURT OF MASSACHU- 
SETTS, 1652 
“Tf it should be granted that learning, namely, skill in the tongues 
and liberal arts, is not absolutely necessary for the being of a 
Commonwealth and churches, yet we conceive that, in the judgment 
of the godly wise, it is beyond all question not only laudable, but 
necessary for the well-being of the same; and although New England 
   
-P-A-G-E-610
586 Appendix B 
(blessed be God) is completely furnished (for this present age) with 
men in place, and upon occasion of death or otherwise, to make 
supply of magistrates, associates in courts, physicians, and officers in 
the Commonwealth, and of teaching elders in the churches, yet for 
the better discharge of our trust for the next generation, and so to 
posterity, seeing the first founders do wear away apace, and that it 
grows more and more difficult to fill places of most eminence as they 
are empty or wanting ; and this court, finding by manifest experience 
that though the number of scholars at our college doth increase, yet 
as soon as they grow up ready for public use they leave the country, 
and seek for and accept of employment elsewhere, so that if timely 
provision be not made it will tend much to the disparagement, if not 
to the ruin, of this Commonwealth: It is therefore ordered and hereby 
enacted by this court, that a voluntary collection be commended to 
the inhabitants of this jurisdiction for the raising of such a sum as 
may be employed for the maintenance of the president, certain fellows, 
and poor scholars in Harvard College, and for that purpose do 
further order, that every town of this jurisdiction do choose one meet 
person to take the voluntary subscriptions of such as shall underwrite 
any sum or sums of money for that purpose, and to make return 
thereof to the next court; and forasmuch as all the colonies are con- 
cerned therein; this court doth order the secretary to signify to the 
governor of the several colonies our endeavors herein, and to com- 
mend the same unto them for their help and furtherance in so good 
a work.” 
AMENDMENT TO THE LAw OF 1647, PASSED IN 1671 
“Whereas the law requires every town, consisting of one hundred 
families or upward, to set up a grammar school, and appoint a master 
thereof, able to instruct youth so as to fit them for the college, and 
upon neglect thereof the said town is to pay five pounds per annum 
to the next Latin school until they shall perform that order, the court, 
upon weighty reasons, judge meet to declare and order, that every 
town of one hundred families and upwards that shall neglect or omit 
to keep a grammar school, as is provided in that law, such town shall 
pay ten pounds per annum unto the next town school that is set 
according to that law. 
“Whereas in the law, title Townships, the several towns and select- 
men of the said towns have power to impose penalties as the law 
directs ; and whereas many constables question whether it be their 
duty to serve warrants. from the selectmen for persons to appear 
before them and to levy fines for the removal of such doubts, and, as 
an addition to the said law, this court doeth order and require that 
all constables respectively shall serve all warrants from the selectmen,
-P-A-G-E-611
  Appendix B 587 
and levy all such fines as shall be imposed by the said towns or 
selectmen.” 
AMENDMENT PASSED 1683 
“That every town consisting of more than five hundred families or 
householders shall set up and maintain two grammar schools and two 
writing schools, the masters whereof shall be fit and able to instruct 
youth as said law directs. 
“ And whereas the said law makes the penalty for such towns as 
provide not schools as the law directs to pay to the next school ten 
pounds: This court hereby enacts that the penalty shall be twenty 
pounds when there are two hundred families or householders.”

may enable them perfectly to read the English tongue, and knowledge 
of the capital laws, upon penalty of twenty shillings for each neglect 
therein ; also, that all masters of families, do, once a week, at least. 
catechise their children and servants, in the grounds and principles 
of religion; and if any be unable to do so much, that then, at the 
least, they procure such children or apprentices to learn some short 
orthodox catechism, without book, that they may be able to answer to 
the questions that shall be propounded to them out of such catechisms 
by their parents or masters, or any selectmen, when they shall call 
them to a trial of what they have learned in this kind; and further, 
that all parents and masters do breed and bring up their children 
and apprentices in some honest lawful [calling,] labor, or employ- 
ment, either in husbandry or some other trade profitable for themselves 
and the commonwealth, if they will not nor can not train them up in 
learning, to fit them for higher employments, and if any of the select- 
men, after admonition by them given to such masters of families, 
shall find them still negligent of their duty, in the particulars afore- 
mentioned, whereby children and servants become rude, stubborn 
and unruly, the said selectmen, with the help of two magistrates, shall 
take such children or apprentices from them, and place them with 
some masters for years, boys until they come to twenty-one, and 
girls to eighteen years of age complete, which will more strictly look 
unto and force them to submit unto government, according to the 
rules of this order, if by fair means and former instructions they will 
not be drawn unto it.”

STUDENTS OF HARVARD UNIVERSITY, PRINTED IN 
1642. 
(From New England First Fruits. Mass. Hist. Col. I, pp. 242-246) 
“Rules and Precepts that are observed in the Colledge. 
“1. When any Schollar is able to understand Tully, or such like 
classicall Latine author extempore, and make and speake true Latine 
in verse and prose, so ut aiunt Marte: and decline perfectly the 
paradigms of nounes and verbes in the Greek tongue: let him then, 
and not before, be capable of admission into the Colledge. 
“2. Let every student be plainly instructed and earnestly pressed 
to consider well the main end of his life and studies is, to know God 
and Jesus Christ, which is eternall life, John XVII, 3, and therefore 
to lay Christ in the bottome, as the only foundation of all sound 
knowledge and learning. And seeing the Lord only givest wisdom, 
let everyone seriously set himselfe by prayer in secret to seek it of 
him. Prov. II, 3. 
“3. Every one shall so exercise himselfe in reading the Scriptures 
twice a day, that he shall be ready to give such an account of his 
proficiency therein, both in theoreticall observations of the language, 
and logick, and in practicall and spiritual truths, as his Tutor shall 
require according to his ability: seeing the entrance of the word 
giveth light, it giveth understanding to the simple. Psalm CXIX, 
130. 
“4. That they eschewing all profanation of Gods name, attributes, 
word, ordinances and times of worship, doe studie with good con- 
science carefully to retain God and the love of his truth in their 
mindes, else let them know that (nothwithstanding their learning) 
God may give them up to strong delusions and in the end, toa repro- 
bate minde. 2 Thes. II, 11,12. Rom. I, 28. 
“5. That they studiously redeeme the time: observe the generall 
hours appointed for all students and the special houres of their cassis: 
And then diligently attend the lectures without any disturbance by 
word or gesture. And if in anything they doubet, they shall enquire

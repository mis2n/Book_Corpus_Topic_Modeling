  EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION 
Development of the small public school systems, which 
has been in progress during the last eighty or ninety 
years, is resulting in the gradual formulation of the duties 
of the superintendent of the small system. These duties 
include large numbers of specific things which the super- 
intendent of the large city school system naturally and 
inevitably has to delegate to subordinate officials of one 
kind and another. No such delegation is possible to the 
small city school superintendent. He must be adminis- 
trator, business manager, supervisor of all subjects in 
and out of the curriculum. Too frequently also, he has 
gotten into this work without adequate professional 
preparation and is, therefore, apt to be at a loss when 
specific problems of one kind or another have to be 
solved promptly. While it is greatly to be hoped that 
the number of untrained superintendents will decrease 
from year to year, for a long time to come we will have 
in many of our states a majority of superintendents in- 
adequately prepared. These men need just such a volume 
as is herewith submitted to the educational public. The 
author has undertaken to answer in considerable detail 
questions vital to the young superintendent. Many of 
the chapters found in this manual consider topics which 
would not be included in the typical textbook on educa- 
tional administration, yet unless the superintendent has 
an adequate professional library, he needs just such in-

formation. This volume is submitted in the belief that 
for years to come there will exist a very large group of 
school administrators who can greatly profit by its 
possession. 
The manual is written in such a way that it will be of 
great value to members of boards of education through- 
out the United States. This vast body of laymen, upon 
whom has been imposed the responsibility of the control 
of the local schools, contains a large number who, while 
anxious to render intelligent service to their community, 
have never given careful consideration to the general 
problems of the school, nor have they analyzed in any 
careful way their relation to the proper solution of the 
problems. They should find in this presentation of 
fundamental conditions confronting school officials much 
of interest and value, and it is hoped the volume will 
eventually find a place in the business offices of our 
boards of education.

  FOREWORD 
This book has been written with the small school 
system in mind and with a view to help especially the 
young superintendent and principal, or those of limited 
experience in the field of administration and supervision. 
It is not a complete treatment of school administration 
and supervision, or an exhaustive treatment of any 
phase of the subject. Its object is to offer in plain, simple 
style practical suggestions and concrete illustrations that 
will be helpful in the solution of the numerous problems 
and situations of the smaller school system. 
Practically all books on school administration and 
supervision written heretofore have been written for the 
city school system and have generally been inapplicable 
to small systems, which are far more numerous than 
larger ones. 
H. R. Bonner of the United States Bureau of Educa- 
tion in the report of his study of 13,961 high schools, 
says: “One-fourth of the high schools in the United 
States enroll from 2 to 27 students; another fourth from 
27 to 50 students; another fourth from 50 to 100 students; 
and the last fourth, over 100 students.” According to 
Bonner, the average enrollment of the 13,961 high schools 
in 1917-18 was 124, with more than three-fourths of the 
-number below the average and less than one-fourth 
above. 
It is safe to assume that the relative proportion of 
vii

these figures have not changed greatly since 1917-18, and 
that a somewhat similar relation exists in the enrollment 
of both the grade and high school pupils of these school 
systems. It is for the 75 per cent of smaller school 
systems that this book is intended primarily. 
Every effort has been put forth to be specific and to 
present in a clear and direct manner such information 
and data as are applicable and have been fairly well 
tested and established. No new, untried theories and 
radical reform measures have been included and the book 
contains no padding. Underlying educational principles 
have been kept in mind throughout the writing of the 
book and have been briefly explained whenever it seemed 
advisable. 
Much of the material used has been gathered by the 
writer from many sources, during a period of several 
years. The selection and development of the subject- 
matter is based on a number of years of actual experi- 
ence as teacher, principal, and superintendent in smaller 
school systems, and on a critical reading of various other 
works. It may be said, therefore, that the directions, 
illustrations, and suggestions given in this book represent 
or express in a large measure the combined experiences 
and consensus of opinions of many leading men and 
women in the field—teachers, supervisors, and adminis- 
trators. They must not be regarded as the judgments 
of a single individual. This is essential in a book of this 
nature. No one person possesses expert knowledge of so 
many different problems and phases of education as are 
herein treated. Throughout, the writer has not only 
given his own views but has quoted many others of rec- 
ognized authority in their particular fields. The different 
 
-P-A-G-E-7
  FOREWORD ix 
chapters have been submitted for criticisms and sugges- 
tions to a number of experienced and successful school 
administrators in service, after which many of them 
have been revised or rewritten in part or entirely. 
It is a well known fact that the training of school ad- 
ministrators cannot be completed in colleges or academic 
institutions. Their final training and development must 
come through contact and experience with actual school 
work and community problems. College courses in school 
management, administration, and supervision are all 
right in their place and should be encouraged. Gen- 
erally speaking, however, they should be made more 
practical and less theoretical than they have been in the 
past, especially for beginners. Too often they have been 
concerned chiefly with certain phases of more technical 
problems and have missed the mark in teaching beginners 
the things they most needed to know. Not infrequently 
those teaching these courses have themselves had no ac- 
tual experience and have too little contact with the many 
varied school and community problems with which a 
school administrator must deal. It is rarely through 
lack of technical information or advanced training that a 
beginning administrator fails. It is more often through 
lack of information or understanding of some one or 
more of the many practical problems with which he is 
obliged to cope, both in and out of the schools. Among 
these are: (1) To find out what the community needs 
and wants; (2) how to plan general and daily programs 
in accordance with the available building facilities, 
equipment, and teaching force; (3) evaluation of sub- 
ject-matter and its relation to the community and the 
country at large; (4) analysis and distribution or as-
-P-A-G-E-8
  z FOREWORD 
signment of work to be done; (5) methods of record 
keeping and school accounting; (6) methods of teaching; 
(7) setting up goals; (8) promoting effective team work. 
The school administrator of a smaller school system 
must also be an organizer, statistician, supervisor of in- 
struction, etc., as well as a teacher. His duties are many 
and varied, and during his first year he is usually obliged 
to flounder around and grope in the dark with respect 
to much of his work. He may be ever so well equipped 
with scholarship and professional training, but he soon 
learns that this is not sufficient, and that much of it is 
not applicable in solving many of the problems that are 
forced upon him, and that he finds himself obliged to 
meet by “hit or miss” or “trial and error” methods. It is 
here that he is most in need of direct and practical in- 
formation that can be applied to the situation at hand. 
The writer remembers too vividly his first experience 
as a superintendent, the blunders that were made, the 
revelation of new problems that presented themselves, 
and the disillusionment that came with an attempt to 
put into immediate practice some of the theories that 
have been brought fresh from college. 
It is for those who are out on the job and who must 
cope with the situation as it is that a book, which treats 
in a brief and definite manner the duties, problems, and 
situations that are most likely to present themselves, will 
be found most helpful. Here such matters as general 
training, certificates or degrees held, knowledge of meth- 
ods and measurements, and “Greatest efficiency” are all 
of secondary importance as compared with any prac- 
tical, immediate, workable method for solving a problem 
or handling a situation that will not permit of delay.
-P-A-G-E-9
  FOREWORD xi 
On the other hand, general training and scholarship 
are necessary, and it should be said here that if the 
would-be administrator is fairly well equipped with 
scholarship, if he is alert and possesses a reasonable 
amount of good judgment and tact, if he knows where 
and how to look for necessary information, and that he 
is willing to work and learn, he will, under ordinary 
circumstances, soon accumulate the information that will 
enable him to cope with and solve most of the problems 
that arise. 
While this volume has been written primarily for ad- 
ministrators and supervisors it is believed that it will be 
of practical service to the classroom teacher since much 
of the material naturally deals directly with the teach- 
er’s work. If it is of service to those in the field it will 
also be suitable for a textbook in normal schools and 
colleges where young people seek their training. 
The writer acknowledges his indebtedness to all those 
whose contributions and suggestions have been utilized in 
writing this book, and especially to the following who 
have read the various chapters in manuscript and have 
freely given their best advice: 
F. A. Welch, former Superintendent of Schools and 
State Inspector of Approved Graded and High Schools 
in Iowa; Dr. C. E. Germane, former Superintendent of 
Schools, now Dean of Department of Education, Des 
Moines University, Des Moines, Iowa; E. H. Bosshardt, 
Superintendent of Schools, Atlantic, Iowa; Luther Land- 
strom, Superintendent of Schools, Madrid, Iowa.

CHAPTER I 
DO YOU WANT TO BE A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR? 
Deciding on a vocation—Choosing or deciding on a 
vocation is one of the most important things one has to 
‘do in a lifetime. Especially is this true of a calling or 
profession for which several years of preparation are re- 
quired and an additional number of years to become es- 
tablished. Life is too short and competition too keen, 
generally, to allow a second choice in a calling of this kind 
- without considerable loss of time and effort. It is true 
that many do change to and succeed in other lines after 
having given a number of years to some particular calling, 
but as arule those who have made extensive preparations 
for some line of work do not change to some other field, 
even if they are not as successful as many others in the 
same calling or vocation. This is true of men in school 
work as well as of those in other fields of activity. It is 
very important, therefore, that one obtain as much gen- 
eral information as possible about a given vocation be- 
fore making a definite decision or beginning extensive 
preparation for the work in question. 
Importance of knowing what is involved—A young 
man who expects to become a principal or a superintendent 
3
-P-A-G-E-20
4 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
of schools should seek to find out as early as possible what 
preparations he will be required to make, what his chief 
work will consist of, and what his remuneration or reward 
will probably be. He should study and analyze himself 
carefully to see whether or not his natural abilities, de- 
sires, and temperament are such that he will be reason- 
ably sure of success after making the necessary prepara- 
tions. If he expects to go into this field with the thought 
of making it a life’s vocation, it is all-important that he 
have an understanding of what is required in natural 
ability and preparation, as well as what his chief duties 
and reward will be. A young man with good character 
and with fair scholarship, judgment, and tact may be rea- 
sonably sure of success as a school administrator if he is 
sincere and interested in the work, and is willing to sub- 
mit to the necessary training and discipline. If he does 
not possess these qualifications, if he is not willing to give 
his best efforts for a number of years in order to qualify 
himself, he will probably not be successful and should 
find employment where he will be less likely to do harm. 
No one should be led to think that the school man has 
an easy, carefree, and independent life. But who wants 
an easy, carefree, and independent life? While there are 
drawbacks and disadvantages to this vocation there are 
also many opportunities and advantages. 
Tenure of office—A good man usually outgrows his first 
and his second position and goes to a larger and more re- 
sponsible place. This happens not infrequently where he 
fails of reélection because of something he did or did not 
do to suit certain individuals in the community. Some, 
of course, are obliged to change places because they have 
failed to measure up to the general requirements. Under
-P-A-G-E-21
DO YOU WANT TO BE A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR? 5 
such circumstances a necessary change is often a blessing 
in disguise. It does not mean that they will be unsuccess- 
ful in their next attempt. Often they overcome their mis- 
takes or shortcomings through this experience, obtain bet- 
ter positions, and eventually become successful school 
men. Many failures, too, have been due to inadequate 
training or lack of training for particular duties. But the 
outlook for the future is improving in this respect. Men 
are being better trained and communities are beginning 
to realize the disadvantages of too frequent changes. 
More earnest efforts are being made to employ and retain 
capable men, better salaries are being paid and it is rea- 
sonably safe to say that in the future the tenure will be 
more permanent for those who are qualified. It may never 
be as permanent as in various other callings and profes- 
sions, but this also has its virtuous side. Certainty of 
tenure is not always conducive to continued effort and 
- development of one’s best qualities, so necessary in school 
work. 
Requisites of the school administrator—The follow- 
ing is a summary treatment of nine important requisites 
that the school administrator of the future will be re- 
quired to meet in a large measure: 
1. Character. Character is what a man is while repu- 
tation is what he is thought or reputed to be by others. 
Character and reputation, however, are so closely inter- 
related that a reputation of any permanency is seldom 
acquired without character. A good reputation is a valu- 
able asset in any undertaking, but the reputation of the 
school man must be above reproach and suspicion if he 
is to be successful. He cannot hope to get on in school 
work without gaining the respect and good opinion of his 
 
-P-A-G-E-22
  6 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
associates and the community. This he must do by 
proving his worth—by being upright, able, and willing 
to work. If his conduct and habits are such that he can- 
not establish a good reputation he will go down, even 
where an upright man of far less ability would succeed. 
2. Interest and Enthusiasm. It is evident that without 
an interest in the work a principal or a superintendent of 
schools cannot be enthusiastic, and without this he will 
not be able to enlist the interests, efforts, and codperation 
of the teachers, who in turn must inspire and enlist the 
efforts of the pupils. It is a matter of common observa- 
tion and of scientific demonstration that enthusiasm is a 
dynamic and driving force. It is a healthful stimulant 
which increases power to think and to do. Enthusiasm 
begets enthusiasm, and its operation has been a great 
factor in the success of many a man. 
8. Discretion and Tact. The words discretion and tact 
are in some respects synonymous. A school administra- 
tor will always meet with questions and problems that 
cannot be answered or solved by rules or established 
methods, It is of great importance, therefore, that he be 
possessed of discretion or discernment in avoiding errors 
or heedless statements and actions. Webster quotes Ad- 
dison as saying that “It is the discreet man, not the witty, 
nor the learned, nor the brave who guides in conversa- 
tion and gives measure to society.” Tact is defined as the 
ready power of saying and doing what is required by 
circumstances. 
4, Foresight and Initiative. If a school administrator is 
to lead, he must necessarily plan and project his plans into 
the future. Consequently, the more foresight and infer- 
ence to the future he possesses the more likely he is to 
 
-P-A-G-E-23
  DO YOU WANT TO BE A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR? 7 
meet future conditions and demands. If he is to meet 
changing conditions and new developments he will need 
inventive genius or initiative to introduce new measures 
or courses of action. ; 
5. Strength of Personality. The word personality as 
it is commonly used has various shades of meaning. Per- 
sonality, according to Webster, is that which constitutes 
distinction of person and is synonymous with individu- 
ality. According to Coleridge, it is individuality existing 
in itself, but with a nature as a ground. Strong charac- 
acters have a distinct personality or individuality of their 
own. It is this that impresses itself upon others and 
enables them to influence others. It is a valuable asset 
in leadership. 
6. Personal Appearance and Poise. In order to retain 
the respect and prestige that a school administrator 
should have, he must be careful about his personal ap- 
pearance and poise. He should dress in a way becoming 
to his position, carefully avoiding shoddiness or extremes. 
Some of the qualities necessary for proper appearance 
are courage and dignified bearing, properly trimmed hair, 
clean linen, open and cheerful countenance. Voice, ges- 
tures, and general attitude are all indices of physical and 
mental condition. To be a safe leader one must possess 
sufficient poise of mind to be firm, and to remain calm 
in unusual and critical situations. Nothing will more 
quickly convey an impression of weakness or inability 
than to allow oneself to be moved by the spirit or 
emotions that animate the mob, or to be influenced by 
radical reformers and unscrupulous propagandists. This 
applies both in and out of the schools. 
7. Executive Ability. Executive ability may be de- oe
-P-A-G-E-24
  8 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
fined as the power to execute or carry into effect. It 
usually implies strong personality, initiative, and courage 
of conviction. It is a quality that varies greatly with 
different individuals and seems to be inherent rather than 
acquired through training. Like most other qualities, 
however, it is not absolute, but is possessed in a greater 
or less degree by all, and like many other qualities can 
be improved by training and experience. _ 
8. Knowledge of Educational Problems and Systems. 
It is needless to say that a school superintendent or prin- 
cipal should have a certain amount of definite knowledge 
of educational problems and educational systems, as well 
as a fund of general information. If he is to direct the 
affairs of an educational system he should acquaint him- 
self with whatever principles and facts concern the in- 
terest of popular education, and with all matters pertain- 
ing to the organization and administration of the schools. 
He should familiarize himself with other school systems 
in order to make comparisons and possible improvements. 
Visiting and studying other schools is one of the most 
effective ways of picking up additional information and 
judging the efficiency of one’s own system. 
9. Understanding of Children. It may be said that 
none of us fully understand children. Psychologists are 
continually studying and experimenting to supply us 
with additional information, and a public school man 
should acquaint himself as far as possible with all the 
information available, and utilize it to the best possible 
extent. His thoughts and efforts should be concentrated 
and directed toward the problems of reaching the indi- 
vidual child in order to enable him to make the most of 
himself,

The school man of the past—It is true that in past 
years the school man has often been ridiculed and his 
work spoken of more or less disparagingly. In smaller 
communities especially he was frequently looked upon 
as a man who did not possess enough courage and pep 
to enter into competition with men in the business world. 
Often such views have been held unjustly by those who 
did not understand him or the importance of his work. 
Often, too, they have been quite correct and justified. 
School administration as a profession is comparatively 
new, and until recent years many posed as educational 
leaders who had had no professional training or adminis- 
trative experience; who knew little more about school 
work and educational problems than the average citizen 
of the community; and who frequently knew far less 
about social, political, and economic problems of the 
community. Often their election to the position was a 
matter of politics, and with little or no regard for qualifi- 
cations, unless it was ability to shake hands, make a 
speech, or inflict corporal punishment. On the other hand, 
many were serious-minded young men with more or less 
learning and education, but little understanding of 
human nature and social problems. These not infre- 
quently were narrow minded and imagined that when 
they were graduated from some particular course of book 
learning their education was finished; and that thereafter 
their business was to advise everyone, both in and out 
of sckool. They generally failed to take part in the 
activities of the community, but cloistered themselves 
away from the actual community life, acquiring the 
solemnity and dignity of an owl, and setting themselves 
up as kings or czars in a little world of their own creation.

10 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
Instead of growing broader and larger mentally, they be- 
came narrower, more conceited, and more dictatorial. It 
is needless to say that this type of man seldom stayed 
long in one place or built up a school system. 
It is largely because of the low standards or require- 
ments of the past, and of the type of men often em- 
ployed that the school man of today is still looked down 
upon by some, who think of him in terms of what he 
was when they attended school. This should not be 
construed as implying that in the past all school men 
belonged to this class and that today they are all well 
qualified. . There have been many sincere and capable 
men in school work in the past and there are still many 
poor ones today, but there has been a great improvement 
in recent years, and it is safe to say that the relative 
number of qualified men has been and is increasing. 
The school administrator of tomorrow—The school 
administrator of tomorrow must be well qualified if he 
is to be a real leader. Besides having a certain amount 
of general scholarship and special training, he must know 
the problems of society. To know these problems he 
must keep in contact with and be a student of the various 
social problems and industrial movements of his own 
community and of the country at large. His position 
today, if he is well qualified, is a high and noble one. It 
affords an opportunity for a great and worthy service, 
for acquaintanceship with the best citizens of a com- 
_ munity, and for keeping in contact with the best in life. 
.It is a constant challenge to the best there is in a man. 
Nor is it putting it too strong to say that no other calling 
offers greater opportunities for molding the lives of 
others and building for the future. The schools eventu-
-P-A-G-E-27
  DO YOU WANT TO BE A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR? 11 
ally come to stand for what the superintendent and 
principal stand for. It is the personality and influence 
of the teaching corps, the subject-matter that is taught, 
and the way it is taught that shape the ideas and ideals 
of the coming generation. The boys and girls of today 
are the citizens of tomorrow, and upon the training and 
development of their insight and ideals depends the fate 
of the nation in the days to come. : 
“Our schools,” as Governor Allen of Kansas puts it, 
“are the greatest security against the unseen perils of the 
future.” To quote Abbot W. Sherwood, Member of 
Board of Education of Alton, Illinois, “I think I may be 
permitted to say that there is no industry in the whole 
world that can compare with this factory which makes 
fathers and mothers of the next generation.” In the 
words of Dr. Frank Crane, “The school teacher should 
be the leading citizen of every community. He should 
be the best paid. His position should be so high that 
the best minds would aspire to it. When the world grows 
wise its supreme talent and genius will turn toward 
teaching, instead of toward hog-sticking, steel-making, 
or banking. All of the tremendous problems that stump 
us at present, whose solution we consider impossible, 
could be easily solved if we would run them through the 
school-house—that is, if we would begin by instructing 
the next generation.” 
A young man ought to be willing to spend a number of 
years in preparation to secure a position as principal or 
superintendent in even a small school system, and to 
continue studying and working until he is qualified to 
hold a larger or more responsible position. It is a fine and 
worthy investment that yields the highest returns. The
-P-A-G-E-28
12 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
contentment derived from serving others intelligently is 
more wholesome and more permanent than any other 
form of contentment of which a human being is capable. 
The returns may be more remote, and in dollars and cents 
may not compare favorably with those of various com- 
mercial pursuits, but if he is interested in his work his 
ideal will be achievement rather than wealth. And there 
is an opportunity in this field for achievement. As evi- 
dence of this we need only to reflect for a moment on 
the changes and improvements that have been made 
within a few generations in the training of children. We 
see the schools when they were for a-small upper class, 
and with subject-matter which aimed only to intensify 
their aristocratic supremacy; when the masses had 
neither political nor educational rights. We see them 
when the chief interest and stamp of culture was an ac- 
quaintance with the deeds of a few great men, recorded 
in the classic languages and available only to a limited 
few. We see them when knowledge was chiefly for 
knowledge’s sake, and for men only; when there was no 
conception of man as a social creature with reciprocal 
relations and duties to others. We see them when there 
was little or no interest in science or industry; in eco- 
nomic, social, or educational problems. 
Many improvements have also been made in the 
methods of teaching, but we shall probably never fully 
understand the possibilities in training boys and girls. 
In the words of Thorndike, “The psychology of a single 
ten-year-old boy would probably involve as much subject- 
matter for investigation as the astronomy of the solar 
system or the geology of a continent.” 
The economic side of our education has likewise re-
-P-A-G-E-29
  DO YOU WANT TO BE A SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR? 13 
ceived increasing attention. The cheap politician with 
his motives to stifle educational progress is losing ground. 
More and more we hear our leading statesmen advocating 
liberal expenditures for school equipment and salaries. 
We are beginning to realize that the greatest tax of all 
times has been the tax of ignorance. 
In short, it may be said that a young man who is 
capable, and willing to make adequate preparation for 
an educational career in school work, may feel assured 
that he is entering a respectable and noble calling, and 
reasonably sure of a fairly good living. Many are now 
receiving more money for school work than they could 
command in the business or industrial world. This is 
true especially of the inferior or mediocre ones. Those, 
however, whose highest ambition is the acquisition of 
money and whose standard of success is the amount of 
money accumulated, those who would rather be a Roths- 
child or a Rockefeller than a Darwin, Rousseau, or Emer- 
son should not enter the field of public school work, for 
they will likely not reach their goal by that route. When 
all has been said about just compensation, let us not over- 
look the fact that our dollar-standard of values is often 
false; that we are most useful and most welcome, as well 
as happiest and best remembered, not because of what 
we receive but because of what we give. 
What has been said here with respect to preparation, 
qualifications, and opportunities in general applies to 
teachers as well as to administrators. While much of 
the teacher’s work is different than that of the adminis- 
trator or supervisor, it is by no means less important. 
The teacher is after all the indispensable and most essen- 
tial factor in an educational system.
-P-A-G-E-30
CHAPTER II 
SECURING A POSITION 
When a young man has qualified himself to begin his 
career as principal or superintendent of schools, the first 
thing that concerns him is to secure a position. This, 
of course, applies also to the man of experience who is 
out of employment, and to those who are seeking better 
positions. It is often more difficult, however, to secure 
the first position since school boards generally hesitate 
to employ anyone who has not had experience. An in- 
experienced man should familiarize himself with the best 
ways of securing a position. By a careful study of the 
various factors involved some men become artists in se- 
curing positions, and much of the success in their ad- 
vancement is due to this ability. | 
Competition—There are usually a number of appli- 
cants for a given position, and often many. It is fre- 
quently necessary, therefore, to make a number of 
applications before securing an election. It is here not 
infrequently that a young man receives his first lesson in 
competitive strife in the world of men. He should not 
become discouraged if he does not meet with immediate 
and easy success. In fact it is often better if he does not 
find it too easy. There is nothing degrading in honest 
competition. It is the life of business, and is a funda- 
mental essential in a democratic civilization. To the 
14
-P-A-G-E-31
  SECURING A POSITION 15 
more experienced there is generally something stirring 
and inspiring about it. 
The difficulties involved in securing a position in school 
work are no more numerous or greater than in various 
other callings, and probably not nearly so numerous or 
serious as in some others. Most of those who are quali- 
fied obtain positions, and for the few who fail to get just 
what they want it is generally nothing serious or tragic. 
Unlike the actor or musician, a man who is qualified to 
hold the principalship or superintendency of a school 
system is also qualified to do a number of other things, 
and can usually find employment in some line of educa- 
tional work or at something else that will tide him over 
for a year or two if necessary. 
Obtaining information of openings—A candidate 
should proceed in an intelligent and systematic manner 
to find suitable openings early in the year. He should 
plan his campaign carefully and should not resort to a 
hit or miss method, but should make use of every legiti- 
mate means and avenue. He should not be backward 
about asking his friends for help in finding openings, 
especially those who have an opportunity to know of 
places that are or may be open. This should be done 
early in the year, and unless these persons know of the 
candidate’s qualifications it is well to send each of them 
copies of one or two good testimonials. Care should be 
exercised also to keep these persons informed of his 
progress. 
College employment bureaus can often supply infor- 
mation concerning openings and recommend an appli- 
cant for a suitable position. Good agencies can also do 
much to help an applicant find openings. Good agencies
-P-A-G-E-32
  16 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
spend a great deal of money in advertising and in looking 
up the records of applicants. Their business is as legiti- 
mate as that of any other broker or dealer, even though 
it is conducted for private gains. These agencies usually 
charge a small initial enrolment fee of one or two dollars, 
and a commission of 5 per cent of the first year’s salary. 
Care should be exercised concerning the agency with 
which one enrolls, so that reliable and helpful information 
may be obtained of places that are open. Agencies who 
notify many candidates indiscriminately of all openings 
that come to their attention, and urge them to spend 
their time and money in making applications merely to 
increase the agency’s chances for securing a commission, 
often do more harm than good. Such practices in the 
past have led many school officers to avoid all agencies 
as much as possible. 
Communication concerning an interview—As soon as 
information of a suitable opening is received, a written 
application, asking for a personal interview, can be made. 
The board may have many such applications and may 
not reply, in which case the candidate may nevertheless 
apply in person. Often it is advisable to make an imme- 
diate personal application with a view to supply all 
necessary information while on the ground. This is true 
especially if it is late in the season or if it is known that 
the board is ready to take action. It is usually better, 
however, to write or telephone first, asking for an inter- 
view and the most convenient time to come. Telephone 
communications are now very common, and since they 
afford immediate information, are generally more satis- 
factory than letters. If the applicant is seeking a super- 
intendency, it is often best to speak to the president of
-P-A-G-E-33
  SECURING A POSITION 17 
the school board; if a principalship, to the superintendent 
of the system. 
The secretaries of many school boards are very in- 
different about answering letters. So long as they know 
that applications are coming in they will postpone the 
matter. It also frequently happens that one or more of 
the board members are too busy to meet, or that one or 
more of them are out of town. Considering candidates 
for a position is something for which they are not paid 
directly and naturally many of them will tend to their 
own personal or business matters first. Furthermore, it 
not infrequently happens that a number of applicants 
appear in person and that therefore they do not concern 
. themselves greatly with any written application. 
Often the qualifications or requirements sought are 
such as cannot well be determined from a written appli- 
cation. Board members are elected by the people of a 
community to serve their interests. Not infrequently 
these communities are composed of factions or groups 
that represent different interests and set up different 
standards, which consciously or unconsciously govern 
boards in their selection of.a principal or superintendent. 
In some communities he may not smoke or play pool; 
in others he is not allowed to dance. In some places he 
must be a society man while in others his ability to dis- 
cipline incorrigible boys is of primary importance. Some 
communities want a progressive man, others want con- 
servatism. Where the former principal or superintendent 
has failed of reélection it is usually the lack of those 
qualities which caused his failure, or those that are 
thought to have caused his failure, that are uppermost 
in the minds of the board. Board members are as a 
 
-P-A-G-E-34
    18 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
rule very cautious about employing anyone whose elec- 
tion would likely not meet the approval of a certain 
element or faction, especially if this element or faction 
is popular or represents the leaders in the community. 
It may be said, therefore, that a tactful personal appli- 
cation often leads to an election where a written applica- 
tion would have failed to receive attention, or make an 
impression that would have led to a consideration or 
joint action of the board in the absence of the candidate. 
It should be remembered that even a request for an 
interview often necessitates a meeting of several mem- 
bers, for usually no one member cares to assume responsi- 
bility for asking a candidate to make a personal applica- 
tion. It is evident, too, that a board member who shares 
his responsibility with a number of others is not likely to 
have the same interest in any one of a large number of 
applications that a candidate for the position would 
have. Upon interviewing the members of a board a 
candidate often finds that some of them have read his 
application, together with the applications of a number 
of other candidates, but that they do not remember just 
how his application differs from the others. 
The written application—The written application 
should be clear, concise, explicit, and well arranged. In 
expectional cases a pen-written letter may be more likely 
to receive consideration because of its more direct per- 
sonal touch, but generally a typewritten letter is prefer- 
able. It is neater in appearance, more easily read, and 
gives more information on a single page, which aids the 
reader in summarizing its contents, or finding at a glance 
any particular part or item that he may wish to reread 
for further consideration. Often school-board members 
 
-P-A-G-E-35
  SECURING A POSITION 19 
are business men who receive many excellent letters from 
large concerns, and this makes them shrewd critics con- 
cerning letters that are not well thought out, clear, and 
logically arranged. To an experienced and observing 
person a letter portrays to a large extent the general 
education, style, and character of the writer. 
It is needless to say that the form of the letter with 
respect to the relative position of the heading, introduc- 
tion, marginal indentation, paragraphing, and conclusion 
should conform as nearly as possible to the conventional 
style of a good business letter. The form commonly used 
by established business houses may always be followed 
with safety. The mechanical form of the letter may in 
itself be of little importance, but a disregard for or viola- 
tion of established rules, forms, and usages shows the 
carelessness of the writer nevertheless. 
- Only pertinent facts should be given and these should 
be written in the fewest words consistent with good Eng- 
lish, but should include all necessary information. There 
should be no possibility of a misunderstanding or omis- 
sion of necessary information. A board will very rarely 
go to the trouble of acquiring such information, as this 
would generally mean another meeting before a candi- 
date could be seriously considered. It is very probable 
therefore that a candidate whose first letter of application 
is complete will be considered in preference to one who 
has left some important item to be guessed at. Further- 
more, any obscurity or omission of an important item 
may leave a doubt or suspicion in the mind of the reader. 
A good way to do is to arrange the subject-matter of the 
letter mentally as far as possible, make a rough outline, 
and then work this outline over. Few people, including
-P-A-G-E-36
  20 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
many of those who have had considerable experience, can 
write a good letter of several paragraphs without some 
preliminary study and sketching of the construction and 
order of the various paragraphs and sentences. 
The letter should contain information concerning the 
following: (1) Age, health, height, weight, church mem- 
bership or preference; (2) education; and (3) experience 
and success. Each of the above three groups should 
constitute one or more distinct paragraphs. If the can- 
didate has had experience elsewhere he should name the 
place, state how long he was there, and tell briefly about 
his work, the relative standing of the schools, the number 
of pupils enrolled, and anything else that would be help- 
ful to the members of a school board in determining his 
qualifications for the position in question. If he has been 
reélected or has received an increase in salary this should 
be mentioned in the letter. Such information is usually 
the best evidence of success. Any outstanding work may 
also be mentioned. A recent photograph should be in- 
closed, a few good recommendations (not more than 
two or three), and a list of two or three references 
from reputable parties who know of the candidate’s 
qualifications, 
One should be very careful concerning whom he gives 
as references. Many people are indifferent about writing 
letters, and others do not know how to write a good 
letter. It is usually well to take the matter up with these 
parties beforehand. As a general rule it is not advisable 
for a candidate to have letters written in his behalf until 
it is reasonably sure that he will be favorably considered, 
in order that he will not need to call on his friends too
-P-A-G-E-37
  
SECURING A POSITION 21 
many times in case he finds it necessary to make a num- 
ber of applications. 
The personal application—The personal application, 
like the written one, should be carefully and skilfully 
made. A candidate for a position like a salesman has 
something to sell. His ability and labor is his stock in 
trade, and he wishes to sell it to the best advantage. It 
is important, therefore, that he know how to go about 
to sell his stock. Efficient salesmanship is based upon 
definite knowledge. It is the acquisition of accurate 
knowledge and its correct application. 
Upon arrival, it is usually well to obtain permission to 
go through the school building or buildings in order to 
get a general knowledge of the building facilities and 
equipment, and of the general arrangement and plan of 
administration. The candidate will then have a better 
understanding of what he is applying for, and can dis- 
cuss these matters more intelligently with the board 
members. If he is experienced he can often suggest 
improvements, which will appeal to most school boards 
if done tactfully. 
In interviewing board members it should be remem- 
bered that no two are alike. An experienced and success- 
ful salesman will study every prospective customer as 
carefully as a puzzle in order to learn how to approach 
him in a manner conforming to his individual nature. 
First impressions are all-important and are generally 
lasting impressions. It should be borne in mind there- 
fore that appearance, hand-shaking, voice, walk, man- 
ners, and actions are all manifestations and earmarks 
of an individual’s character and ability. An open counte-  
-P-A-G-E-38
22 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
nance, cheerful expression, and good physical condition 
are, of course, valuable assets. The human face and its 
expression have been studied for centuries as an index 
to the mind, and without rule or science to guide him, the 
average man consciously or unconsciously reads and is 
influenced by the face. 
If the candidate is one who has failed of reélection in 
some other place he may find it necessary to make an 
explanation of this fact. To fail of reélection does not 
V necessarily mean that the candidate is incapable or has 
failed to do his duty. Most good school men have some 
enemies, especially if they are progressive. It may be 
that he refused to employ the daughter of one of the 
board members; that he refused to let the son of some 
popular citizen run the school; or that he raised the 
school taxes by bringing about some needed improvement. 
Bringing about a decision—Sometimes it is possible 
to get the president of the board to call a meeting of the 
various members to interview and decide on a candidate, 
but this cannot always be counted on. Often a candidate 
will be told that he will be considered and notified later. 
In this case he may not know what the outcome will be, 
or whether to continue trying for other places in the 
meantime. It is usually well to remain on the ground 
a reasonable length of time and obtain an answer while 
there, unless there is some good reason why it cannot be 
had. The candidate may, if it seems advisable, suggest 
wiring to one or more parties concerning him, and at his 
expense. If one or more of the board members are out 
of town for a day or two it may be better to wait until 
they return than to go and apply at the next place where 
the conditions are likely to be similar. If the candidate
-P-A-G-E-39
  SECURING A POSITION 23 
is not satisfied with his probable success, however, he 
should immediately seek other openings. Often the 
school-board members or their friends in one place know 
of openings in other places. 
Keeping in good spirit—The following advice will be 
found helpful to those who are out of employment and 
are inclined to become discouraged: 
Do not lose your courage or spirit and resort. to self- 
pity or self-depreciation. This will only lessen your 
chances for success. Brace up and work systematically. 
You are wrestling with a big and important task, and 
you cannot reasonably expect a suitable position to be 
waiting for you just when you are ready. If you work 
patiently and persistently you will find what you are 
looking for, and in case you should not find it this year 
and should be obliged to take a less desirable position or 
other work for a year, be big enough to accept it without 
becoming despondent or embittered. You are still no 
worse off than many other capable persons—the doctor, 
lawyer, actor, musician, or business man—who are not 
succeeding in doing well for a single year. The matter 
is usually not so serious as it at first seems to be. An- 
other year may bring better success; and so long as you 
keep in good cheer things will, as a rule, come out well 
in the end. Just remember there are hundreds of thou- 
sands in the world who would gladly change places with 
you and of these many would be willing to give an eye 
or an arm to boot. 
The trouble with many of us under such circumstances 
is that we become discouraged and quit too soon. When 
for a brief time uncontroilable circumstances seem to 
defeat our hopes and efforts we lose heart and give up.
-P-A-G-E-40
  CHAPTER III 
THE SUPERINTENDENT'S RELATION WITH HIS BOARD 
It is highly important that a superintendent clearly 
understand his proper relation with the board of educa- 
tion. His success will in a large measure depend on his 
ability to get along well with the members of his board. 
This frequently calls for a knowledge and understanding 
of matters that are only remotely and indirectly related 
to his duties within the schools, and for abilities quite 
different from those required for organizing and directing 
the work of a small corps of teachers. Generally, it calls 
for good common sense and tact, and an understanding 
of the business and social interests of the community as 
well as of specific duties within the schools. 
Experience versus training—The young and inexpe- 
rienced superintendent sometimes fails to appreciate the 
understanding and good qualities of his board members, 
or to show proper respect for their judgment. He is apt 
to think at this stage that because he has had special 
training or has graduated from a course in college and 
has been elected as head of the schools, he is expected to 
know everything pertaining to the education and welfare 
of children and young people, and that he should speak 
with authority on or advise all persons with respect to 
matters of their educational life. As a rule, it may be 
said that such a person does not yet realize his limita- 
24
-P-A-G-E-41
SUPERINTENDENT'S RELATION WITH HIS BOARD 25 
tions. If he is to make progress, he must continue to 
learn from others. It is easy for him to overlook the fact 
that the members of the board, generally composed of 
men and women experienced in different callings and 
different walks of life, are in position to judge his work 
from various angles and to know better than he what 
the demands and needs of the community are. None of 
the members may have had the academic training that 
he has had, but usually among them are business men, 
industrial leaders, or men of affairs who have had wide 
experience and who can size up a situation very quickly. 
Not infrequently, too, one finds on the board professional 
men and men of wide training and experience who have 
had an opportunity to study the duties and requirements 
of a number of superintendents. It is now also quite 
common to have one or more women of intelligence and 
breadth of vision represented on the school board. Such 
women usually have a better understanding of the needs 
of small children and growing boys and girls than men 
have. Their views and voice may add a much needed 
balance to the board in adjusting the work and life of 
the school to the needs of these boys and girls. If the 
superintendent is alert and thoughtful he will not only 
welcome but will seek the advice of these men and 
women in order to profit by their experience, and will be 
careful to show his appreciation for their advice and 
suggestions. 
On the other hand it must be said that in smaller com- 
munities, especially, the leading and most competent 
citizens not infrequently refuse to serve on the school 
board. Some are conscientious and fear that they are not 
qualified; others fear they may offend certain people, be
-P-A-G-E-42
26 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
criticised, and thereby injure their business; while others 
again are unwilling to assume the responsibility or to 
give the necessary time. This frequently causes men and 
women to be elected board members who are not qualified 
for the position. Often they do not realize or appreciate 
their responsibility. There are, however, few school 
boards on which there are not one or more members of 
good sound judgment. 
Powers and duties of the superintendent—The powers 
and duties of the school superintendent are defined by 
state laws only in general terms, and in most cases very 
meagerly. They are usually delegated to him by the 
school board and are, as a rule, implied rather than ex- 
pressed, especially in smaller places. These powers and 
duties have been established by custom rather than by 
legislation, and it may be said that they are very much 
the same in all school systems of a given size. The duties, 
however, vary considerably with the size of the school 
system. 
A superintendent should clearly understand and al- 
ways bear in mind that the children belong to the people 
of the community who are also paying the taxes; that 
the school-board members have been elected to represent 
the people; that he had been employed by them as their 
executive officer or manager; and that his powers and 
duties are subject to their rules. The board is responsible 
to the people and the superintendent in turn is respon- 
sible to the board. His relation to the board is very 
much the same as that of a superintendent of a private’

ent to conduct the business. The directors in either case 
may know very little about the details or actual work 
to be done, but they are responsible, nevertheless, for its 
proper execution through the man they have employed. 
A wise superintendent will make a careful study of the 
extent and limitations of his powers and duties, of the 
powers and duties of the board, and of his proper relation 
with the board concerning matters that should be decided 
by both. A wise school board, likewise, will seek to give 
the superintendent power and freedom of action com- 
mensurate with his ability and responsibilities. 
The following is a summary of some of the powers and 
duties that are generally delegated, either expressly or 
tacitly, to superintendents of villages, towns, and smaller 
cities. They are the general and more common ones. 
No attempt has been made here to compile a complete 
list of duties, or to go at length into the many and varied 
details. 
1. To act as executive officer of the school board and, 
generally, to direct all employees connected with the 
schools. 
2. To have supervision of the public schools of 
the community or district, their organization, and 
classification. 
3. To plan and develop with the aid of the principal 
and teachers a course of study, and to arrange a daily 
program of study, instruction, and recreation. 
Note: It is generally understood that the superintendent’s plans 
with respect to these matters are subject to the approval of the 
board or a committee of the board. In smaller places, however, the 
board as a rule does not investigate or inquire into these matters, 
but leaves them to the superintendent. 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  28 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
4. To make such rules and regulations for the manage- 
ment and government of the schools as he and the 
teachers may deem necessary and proper. 
5. To select text books, apparatus, and educational 
supplies. 
Note: Usually, where it is customary for the superintendent to 
select and order the books and supplies, he orders the regular and 
necessary text books and supplies without consulting the board. 
The purchasing of equipment and apparatus is practically always 
subject to the approval of the board, excepting for limited or stated 
amounts, often not to exceed from ten to twenty-five dollars. It is 
well for a superintendent to have a clear understanding with his 
board concerning the amount of money he is permitted to spend 
without a special approval of the board. 
6. To investigate applicants for positions in the 
schools, and to recommend or nominate teachers for elec- 
tion by the board or teachers’ committee. 
Note: In some places the selection and appointment of teachers 
is left largely to the superintendent, especially if he has been in the 
community one or more years and has demonstrated his ability. 
Where this is done the superintendent reports the selection or ap- 
pointment to the board or teachers’ committee who then formally 
elect the teacher. It is not always wise for a superintendent to 
seek or assume the sole responsibility in the selection of teachers, 
especially if he is inexperienced. There will likely always be one or 
more teachers in the system who will fail to meet the approval of 
the community, and where their selection has been left entirely to 
the superintendent he will be held responsible for their success accord- 
ingly. It is often better to divide this responsibility with the various 
members of the board or committee on the selection of teachers by 
having them consider and approve of the applicants nominated by 
the superintendent. 
7. To assign and transfer teachers and to recommend 
the reélection and dismissal of teachers. 
8. To fix the time and prescribe a mode of regula 
examinations, to supervise the promotion and classifica-

SUPERINTENDENT'S RELATION WITH HIS BOARD 29 
tion of pupils, and to classify applicants for admission 
to the schools. 
9. To see that registers and all necessary records are 
properly kept. 
10. To hold teachers meetings as often as he thinks 
advisable for the discussion of methods of teaching, and 
matters pertaining to the daily program, discipline, ex- 
aminations, etc. 
11. To promote effective team-work among teachers, 
and harmony and interest in all school work. . 
12. To employ temporary, substitute teachers in case 
of sickness or inability of the regular teachers. 
13. To suspend pupils when it becomes necessary. 
Note: It is well to have a clear understanding with the board 
concerning the suspension of pupils, or to take the matter up with 
the board beforehand whenever it seems necessary to suspend a 
pupil. Nothing is more likely to get a superintendent into trouble 
than the suspension of some popular but mischievous pupil. Where 
a definite understanding can be had beforehand, or where the sus- 
pension can be made the joint act of the superintendent and the 
board, it carries more weight and the superintendent is less likely to be 
unjustly criticized. A superintendent should never assume authority 
to expel a pupil from school, or to dismiss a teacher as this is 
properly the duty of the board. Any suspension should be promptly 
reported to the board for action. 
14. To have general supervision over the janitor’s 
work and see that it is properly done. 
15. To keep the board informed of the progress, needs, 
and condition of the schools; to suggest means for im- 
provements; and to make such reports as the board may 
require. 
16. To attend board meetings. 
Powers and duties of the board—The powers and 
duties of boards of education are somewhat more defi- 
   
-P-A-G-E-46
  30 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
nitely outlined by legal statutes than are the powers and 
duties of superintendents. Yet they are in many respects 
indefinite and are frequently not understood by the 
members themselves or by the people of the community. 
School boards are often criticized for attempting to 
handle technical and professional matters that should be 
left to the superintendent—for employing expert advice 
and then attempting to do the advising themselves. 
Often they are criticized, too, for spending too much of 
their time in handling routine matters that could be 
handled much better and much more promptly by the 
superintendent, principal, and teachers. It should be 
said here, however, that in many instances there has been 
considerable justification for such action on the part of 
the board, for too often superintendents have not been 
qualified to do their duty. Many communities have been 
obliged to change the heads of their school system every 
year or two until the school board has found it necessary 
to take certain matters in its own hands. 
It is probably safe to say that the average school board 
commits more sins of omission than sins of commission. 
In the smaller communities, especially, there is always a 
tendency to postpone action and to allow the superin- 
tendent to handle all matters pertaining to the schools, 
often without any investigation or concern on the part 
of the board. 
The following is a list of some of the more important 
powers and duties of the school board: 
1. To estimate and levy taxes and to issue bonds in ac- 
cordance with state and municipal laws and regulations. 
2. To provide buildings, grounds, and equipment. 
38. To select school sites.
-P-A-G-E-47
  
SUPERINTENDENT'S RELATION WITH HIS BOARD 31 
4. To consider and approve building plans. 
5. To approve of or make the final decision concerning 
any needed or proposed expansion or enlargement of the 
educational system. 
6. To determine or pass upon the annual budget of 
expenses. 
7. To act as custodian of all school property. 
8. To establish the length of the school year. 
9. To elect a superintendent, principal, teachers, jani- 
tor, and other employees. 
10. To fix the salary of all employees. 
11. To advise with the superintendent or pass upon 
the course of study. 
12. To require and consider reports of business 
transactions. 
13. To require and consider reports of the superin- 
tendent concerning the progress of the school. 
14. To debate and pass upon recommendations of the 
superintendent. 
15. To act as a court of final appeal for the teachers, 
principal, and school patrons in matters that the superin- 
tendent has not been able to handle satisfactorily. 
In general it may be said that the duties of the board 
are chiefly legislative, dealing with financial matters; 
while those of the superintendent are chiefly executive, 
dealing with educational matters. 
Extracts from various sources—The following ex- 
tracts will serve as additional information to show the 
general practice and opinion concerning the relationship 
between superintendents and school boards with respect 
to powers and duties: 
“The city rightly and naturally looks to the board as

representing the public, the taxpayers, and the parents, 
and to the superintendent as being the expert guardian 
of the interests of the children. This does not mean that 
the deliberative work of the board should be limited to 
telling the superintendent what the public wants, and 
the work of the superintendent limited to putting these 
orders into execution. In addition to his work as execu- 
tive, the main business of the superintendent is to think, 
to plan, and to propose, and the business of the board is 
to make decisions about these proposals.” 1 
“The Board of Education should provide all the means 
necessary for carrying on the work, such as securing 
needed funds and constructing buildings, and should be 
ready to advise its executive officers whenever such ad- 
vice is needed or desired. The agents whom they have 
elected to perform in detail the executive functions of 
the board are easily removed if found to be either incom- 
petent or unworthy of confidence. They should give to 
these officers the most unqualified support as long as they 
perform faithfully and well their duties, and should be 
prompt in holding them to strict account in case of any 
failure of duty or evident unfitness of their task.” * 
“At the head of the school department is the Superin- 
tendent of Schools. His chief function will be the super- 
vision of instruction, but with final jurisdiction, subject 
only to the Board of School Directors, in the case of 
other matters than instruction. He should be made the 
real head and leader of the school system in fact, as well 
as in name, and full responsibility for the successful con-

duct of all departments of the educational service should 
be placed squarely on his shoulders. He should, accord- 
ingly, be given tenure, salary, jurisdiction, and authority 
commensurate with the responsibility placed upon him. 
. . . So long as he can stand up under such responsibility, 
and handle the affairs of the department with wisdom 
and good sense, the Board should stand by him and his 
recommendations; whenever the Board comes to feel 
that he does not come up to the position which has been 
created, or does not fill the position as it should be filled, 
they should call for his resignation and select someone 
else who has the proper personality, courage, knowledge 
and insight.” ® 
“In all matters such as the hygienic aspects of school- 
house construction, the authorizing of course of study, 
the selection of text and supplemental books, passing on 
the competency of instruction or the efficiency of the 
service in the school department,—matters which no 
board of laymen is competent to pass intelligently upon, 
—action should be based only on the recommendation of 
the expert educational office of the board. 
“This leaves the board free to attend to the main busi- 
ness which they are elected to handle, and frees them 
from the hundreds of petty annoyances incident to the 
personal pulls and influences which beset any lay school 
board which attempts to exercise expert functions.” ¢ 
“The general policy of the school should be outlined 
by the principal but authorized by the board. The prin- 
cipal should then be intrusted with the carrying out of 
that policy and the execution of its details. Expendi-

tures are usually suggested by the principal, but must 
always be authorized by the board.” © 
The individual board member—An individual board 
member can and often does give a young or inexperienced 
superintendent good and necessary advice by way of sug- 
gestion or direct information. But as an individual 
board member he has no authority to give orders or de- 
cide matters, unless this authority has been expressly 
delegated to him by the vote of the board. 
It sometimes happens that an individual member, not 
understanding what his proper duties are, takes matters 
into his own hands and instructs or directs the superin- 
tendent concerning his duties, or unwisely interferes with 
his plans and work. In such instances the superintend- 
ent should inform the individual member of the necessity 
of bringing the matter up at a board meeting, or he 
should himself present the matter at a meeting of the 
board. In case of a dispute or adverse criticism, he 
should be very careful and tactful. He should make sure 
that he is right, and, if he is young and inexperienced, he 
will usually do well to seek the advice of the board rather 
than to assume an air of authority. If he knows his 
business he will be able to convince the board that he is 
right without creating ill feelings, doubt, or misunder- 
standing. If he finds that he has been wrong he should 
make a manly apology. By discussing such matters 
frankly at a meeting of all the board members, an indi- 
vidual member will as a rule be satisfied with the decision 
of the board, and if he is not satisfied and is inclined to 
feel wronged or to make the matter a personal issue he

Schools, pp. 44, 45.

cannot so easily misrepresent matters or misquote the 
superintendent. 
It is well to have a clear understanding from the first 
to the effect that patrons, teachers, and pupils must not 
take their grievances directly to some member of the 
board without first consulting the superintendent. Such 
a procedure is unfair to the superintendent and detri- 
mental to the harmonious workings of the school. If 
the superintendent is unable to handle a complaint satis- 
factorily, it should be submitted to the board in session, 
and preferably by the superintendent. To quote from 
the Survey Report of Ogden, Utah, “The individual 
board member should not attempt to dictate school 
policies to the superintendent or to listen to complaints 
from principal, teachers, or parents. All such complaints 
should be referred to the superintendent. An individual 
board member does not have the authority of even the 
lowest paid employee, unless the board by resolution has 
delegated him to exercise authority in certain matters.” 
Board meetings—Great variations exist among boards 
with respect to their meetings. In larger places it is 
customary to have regular meetings at least once a 
month, but in many smaller communities no regular 
meetings are held. Here, in many instances, meetings 
are called by the president of the board only when special 
matters or problems arise, or upon recommendation of 
the superintendent concerning matters of special impor- 
tance. In these meetings the work of the board is often 
done in an informal and haphazard manner and without 
having an adequate record made of the business trans- 
acted. Where such a condition has prevailed the super-  
-P-A-G-E-52
    
36 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
intendent should carefully and tactfully strive to bring 
about better methods. 
It is customary, proper, and important that the super- 
intendent be present and have a right to speak at all 
meetings. It is here, frequently, where he has an oppor- 
tunity to do his best work for the community. If he is 
qualified and knows his business he will as a rule be able 
to convince the board of necessary improvements, and 
will usually get what is needed in buildings, equipment, 
and teachers. School boards generally are not penurious 
or opposed to expenditures for educational purposes if 
they can be convinced that the expenditures are neces- 
sary or justifiable. It is plainly the superintendent’s 
duty to inform the board of any necessary expenditure 
or improvement and to show as far as possible why the 
expenditure or improvement should be made. This he 
can do best by having carefully-prepared statistical data — 
or graphs to present to the board at its meeting, by sup-- 
plying the members with literature pertaining directly 
to matters in question, or by calling their attention to 
specific magazine articles and other sources of informa- 
tion. A wise superintendent will strive to acquaint the 
members of his board with the best available sources of 
information concerning matters pertaining to the welfare 
of the schools, and will see to it that such information is 
made easily accessible to them. Every board should sub- 
scribe regularly for one or more copies of the School 
Board Journal. 
Not infrequently it is found that a single influential 
and dominant member of the board, by sheer argument 
and persuasion, leads all the other members, and often 
practically decides matters of great importance in de- 
 
-P-A-G-E-53
SUPERINTENDENT'S RELATION WITH HIS BOARD 37 
termining the policy of the schools. Frequently where 
such a condition prevails the other members of the board 
are either indifferent or fear to take the initiative in pre- 
senting a matter or in suggesting a method of procedure. 
Where a single member is thus inclined or is likely to 
determine the decision of an important matter, it may 
be well to point out tactfully the advisability of voting 
by ballot in order that every member may freely and de- 
liberately exercise his best judgment. In short, all meet- 
ings should be conducted according to parliamentary 
rules, and a complete record should be kept of all business 
transacted. In the words of Chancellor, “Through the 
board of education, the people rule the school. A board 
member is neither an educator nor a governor. As a 
board member, he is, individually, nothing but a citizen. 
An individual counts only as one of the majority in 
control. There is no board of education except in meet- 
ing duly called and convened, and then only after roll- 
_ call and before adjournment. Not even in board meeting 
has a member any authority; he has only his voice and 
his vote. The control of the school is in the vote. The 
resolutions that are regularly adopted govern the 
schools.” ° 
Committees—In small communities the various duties 
of the board are generally performed by the members 
acting together as a whole while in larger places much 
of the work is done by committees. There is, however, a 
wide difference in practice with respect to the appoint- 
ment of standing and special committees among school 
boards. 
®°W. E. Chancellor, Our Schools Their Administration and Super- 
vision, p. 11
-P-A-G-E-54
  38 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
In some respects there are distinct advantages in 
having certain duties performed by committees, even for 
boards of smaller communities. This is especially true 
where the board members are indifferent about holding 
or attending regular meetings, or where one or more of 
the members live on farms at some distance from the 
village or town. Under such circumstances it may be 
well to have, for example, a standing committee of two 
or three members on the appointment of teachers, a pur- 
chasing committee, and a committee on buildings and 
grounds, since it is usually much easier to secure a 
meeting of and action on the part of two or three persons 
than to get the board as a whole to meet and decide on 
a matter. But care should be exercised to avoid com- 
plicating matters by appointing too many committees. 
Whenever practicable important matters should be set- 
tled by the board as a whole or should be investigated 
by a committee and then referred to the board as a whole. 
Selection of board members—As a matter of profes- 
sional service it is entirely proper for a superintendent 
to exercise his best influence with the people of his com- 
munity in the selection and appointment of good board 
members. His efforts in this direction should, however, 
always be motivated by the principles involved, and 
should never become a personal matter. The aim should 
always be to elect persons who are well qualified for the 
position. There is no official position that involves 
greater responsibilities or affords greater opportunities 
for real service than a position which deals with the 
development of the boys and girls of the community. 
Upon the views and attitude of those elected on the 
board of education the progress of the schools and the
-P-A-G-E-55
  
SUPERINTENDENT'S RELATION WITH HIS BOARD 39 
success of the superintendent may in a large measure 
depend. 
Good business ability and an understanding of educa- 
tional needs are essential requisites of good board mem- 
bers. Politicians and dishonest men who are likely to use 
the office for political or personal advantages should not 
be elected on the school board. A superintendent who 
is sincere will oppose the election of such men. Men 
who are unsuccessful in their own affairs, also, as a rule, 
do not make good board members. 
Where there is a parent-teacher association the selec- 
tion of suitable board members may well be taken up at 
a regular meeting of this organization. At such a meet- 
ing names of suitable persons may be suggested and 
discussed in an open and frank manner before nomina- 
tions are made. In this way a genuine interest may be 
created in the matter and hasty action, underhanded 
work, and factional strife prevented.

CHAPTER IV 
SELECTING AND EMPLOYING TEACHERS 
One of the most important duties that confront a 
superintendent is to secure a good corps of teachers. On 
his ability to secure and hold well-qualified teachers, 
more than on anything else, will depend his success and 
the success of the schools. Communities vary greatly in 
their attitude toward schools and the sacrifice they are 
willing to make to secure efficient teachers and maintain 
- good schools. 
Interest must be created to obtain adequate support 
—In some communities the-schools are the center of 
attraction and interest, while in others there is little real 
concern about schools. Often, even in smaller places, 
some of the leading citizens do not know the superin- 
tendent or‘teachers, and take little interest in the teach- 
ing or management of the schools. But this may also be 
said of other public institutions and business establish- 
ments. It is necessary to create an interest in any 
enterprise before a community can be induced to support 
it, or to tax itself for its improvement and maintenance. 
The business manager who cannot make his enterprise 
known to the public and who cannot create a desire for 
his goods will fail. The minister who cannot interest his 
parishioners will fail to receive the financial support he 
should have. Likewise it may be said that the school 
: 41
-P-A-G-E-58
  42 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
superintendent who cannot interest a community in the 
schools will fail to get adequate financial support. He is 
directly responsible for creating an interest in the insti- 
tution of which he is the head. That is his business. 
Where the superintendent is a “live wire” the commu- 
nity generally is interested in the schools, and is willing 
to pay reasonable salaries for competent teachers. 
Where he is a “dead beat’ there is likely to be little 
interest in schools, low salaries, and inferior teachers. In 
other words, willingness to pay good salaries to teachers 
varies directly with the interest that can be created in 
the schools. 
The superintendent’s influence, authority, and duty 
in selecting teachers—It is true that a superintendent 
does not have specific authority to say who shall be 
elected to a given teaching position or what the salary 
shall be, but the fact-remains-that he is the one who is 
supposed to know the needs of the schools, their relation 
and cost to the community, and these relations as com- 
pared with those of other communities. He is the person 
who is being ‘paid for studying these problems and is, 
therefore, or should be, a very influential-factor in de- 
termining the salaries that a community should pay to 
its teachers. 
The superintendent’s powers and duties with respect 
to the selection and appointment of teachers varies more 
or less with different towns, cities, and with states as a 
whole. In some states the duties of school boards and of 
town and cjty superintendents are more clearly defined 
by law than in others. These laws, however, do not 
always show the practice. State and municipal laws may 
specify that the board, the superintendent, or a com-
-P-A-G-E-59
  
SELECTING AND EMPLOYING TEACHERS 43, 
mittee shall appoint teachers, but this does not prevent 
the superintendent from making the appointment 
through the board, or vice versa. In smaller places much 
usually depends on local customs and on the ability, 
influence, and personality of the superintendent or board 
members. ' 
Statistical studies—A few statistical studies have been 
made on the selection of public school teachers, and 
while these show considerable variation in the relation 
between school boards and their superintendents, it may 
be said, generally, that all recent studies show an increas- 
ing authority and responsibility on the part of the 
superintendent in the selection and appointment of 
teachers. The following is a brief summary of three of 
these studies. From these the reader may gain a fair 
understanding of the general practice in recent years. 
1. In the study made by W. S. Deffenbaugh of 1,327 
cities, having a population of from 2,500 to 30,000, it 
was shown by replies received to a questionnaire that in 
955 cities out of 1,327 the superintendent nominated the 
teachers and in 501 he sometimes appointed them. 
2. Ballou, in his study of seventy cities, summarized 
his data on the appointment of teachers by showing how 
boards and superintendents participate in the appoint- 
ment of teachers as follows: ”

the result of a study made by the author at the Univer-

given in answer to a questionnaire. In order to show the 
variations in the methods of selection in cities of different 
sizes the returns were classified and tabulated separately 
for each of five groups, as shown at the head of the table.

  It will be seen from the above table that the percentag 
of cases where the board and superintendent togethe: 
select the teachers is 53. Likewise it shows that in 25 pe 
cent of the cases the superintendent alone does the se 
lecting, and that the board alone selects the teachers i 
3 per cent of the cases. It is probable that in mosj 
cases no distinction was made between “Superintenden’ 
and Board” and “Superintendent Recommends an

Board Elects.” Likewise it is probable that in most cases 
the teachers’ committee was composed of the superin- 
tendent and board members, or the superintendent, prin- 
cipal, and one or more board members. 
~..Factors to be considered in the selection of teachers 
—In the selection of a prospective teacher it is necessary, 
of course, in the first. place, to consider the educational 
and. professional requirements. These are provided for 
and determined, to a greater or less extent, by state laws, 
and county and municipal regulations,_-Generally speak- 
ing, however, they are inadequate as a-guide for those 
charged with the selection of teachers. - Education and 
professional training are measured by grades made in 
high school or college, and are very often a poor criterion 
by which to measure the teaching. success of an indi- 
vidual. Learning is one thing; teaching, quite another. 
Furthermore, education is only one of many factors to 
be considered in the selection of a teacher. 
The table on page 46 has been compiled from answers 
received to a questionnaire sent out by the writer. It 
shows the relative importance assigned to each of eight- 
een factors or qualities considered from two different 
angles by 420 superintendents and 183 presidents of 
school boards. The first column of figures shows, in per 
cent, the combined rankings of superintendents and 
board members, under “Qualities to be Considered,” 
hile the second column shows similarly the rankings of 
he items under “Why Teachers Fail.” 
By comparing the rankings given in both columns we 
ee that under “Qualities to be Considered” Scholarship 
nd Education was given first place (9.6%), and Disci- 
line was given second place (9.0 %). Under “Why

while Scholarship and Education was given sixth place

course, be used with inexperienced teachers. But 
glance over the various values assigned will give th 
reader an idea of how the emphasis on different requi 
ments is placed by those in the field, and show that teach 
ers are not selected solely or chiefly on a basis of scholar, 
ship and education.

Advantages in having important requirements 
listed—It is generally held by those who have studied 
the problem most that some analytic method of rating 
and recording a limited number of factors or specific 
qualities is helpful in determining the qualifications of 
a teacher for a given position. General information 
based on general impression may be used together-with 
or in addition to Information obtained in this way, but 
should not be used exclusively for determining the fit- 
ness of a teacher. It is true that the human elements 
and characteristics cannot be measured objectively with 
any degree of mathematical accuracy; that any method 
of determining the qualifications of a teacher is more or 
less analytic, either consciously or unconsciously; and 
that any extensive analysis must be followed by a syn- 
thesis, whether the factors are recorded or not. But a 
record of the values assigned to a limited number of 
pivotal factors is helpful in a final synthesis or total eval- 
uation of a teacher’s qualifications. There is nothing in a 
scheme which breaks the problem up into a limited num- 
ber of factors that will prevent anyone from making use 
alsoof any other device or additional information. 
,. The chief advantages afforded by the use of a rating 
blank may be summed up as follows: (1) a list of im- 
portant factors can be carefully and deliberately prepared 
beforehand by those who are experienced or especially 
qualified to do so; (2) the list can be used by anyone; 
(3) its use results in economy of time and effort; (4) it 
guards against any of the factors recorded being over- 
looked; (5) it reveals a great deal of information on a 
single sheet which can be deliberately considered and 
weighed in the absence of the applicant; (6) it provides  
-P-A-G-E-64
  48 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
a method of recording definitely and permanently the 
information sought. 
The inexperienced teacher—It is in the small school 
system that the young superintendent must generally 
begin his career and get his initial experience. In this type 
of school teachers, as a rule, must also get their first ex- 
perience. Thus, not infrequently, it happens that both 
superintendent and teacher are inexperienced, and it is 
the inexperienced, prospective teacher whose success is 
most uncertain, since she cannot produce evidence of abil- 
ity as a teacher. If the superintendent is inexperienced 
he should, as soon as possible, seek to familiarize himself 
with the best methods available for obtaining good teach- 
ers. He may not, if he is inexperienced and new in the 
community, be-authorized to appoint the teachers, and 
it may not be wise for him to seek this responsibility in 
the beginning, especially if there are persons on the school | 
board who have had years of experience in the matter. 
This, of course, does not prevent him from exercising 
his ingenuity and best judgment in obtaining all possible 
information concerning an applicant, and from present- 
ing this information to the board or teachers’ committee 
for consideration. 
A fair knowledge of an applicant’s training, industry, 
personal appearance, and general temperament or make- 
up can usually be obtained from testimonials and answers 
to questionnaires. But the only reliable way to find out 
whether an inexperienced applicant can teach and dis- 
cipline is to let her try. Generally it may be said that 
an individual possessed of good education and industry, 
good personal appearance and good common sense is 
quite likely to make a good teacher under proper super-
-P-A-G-E-65
  SELECTING AND EMPLOYING TEACHERS 49 
vision, while one in whom these qualities are lacking is 
almost certain to fail. It-may be said, also, that inex- 
‘perienced teachers are sometimes preferable to experi- 
enced ones. They are often more teachable, more en- 
thusiastic, and less opinionated or “set” in their ways. 
Other things being roughly equal, experienced teachers 
are, of course, more capable and preferable. 
Experienced teachers—The best way, usually, to ob- 
tain reliable information on experienced teachers is to 
communicate directly with the superintendent, principal, 
or board members of the community in which they have — 
taught. But even this information is not infallible: 
Oceasionally recommendations given by employers or 
supervisors are based in part, on sympathy, or on hope 
that the candidate will do much better in another place. 
Some employers still consider it an act of kindness to 
write a flattering recommendation. It may also be that 
the testimonials given are based on misunderstanding, 
lack of information, prejudice, or ill will. This, however, 
is now rather exceptional. It should be borne in mind 
also that many a teacher who has failed in one place 
because of peculiar local conditions or circumstances has 
been very successful in another place. 
o personal interview, where this is practicable, is gen- 
erally advisable, with both experienced and inexperienced 
teachers. It is best, however, always to have detailed 
written data beforehand, and to guard against basing 
estimates on general impressions only. General impres- 
sions are often very misleading. 
How to solicit applicants—It is well to write to dif- 
ferent colleges and agencies soon after it is known that 
there is to be a vacancy in a given teaching position. In
-P-A-G-E-66
  50 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
doing this one should be sure to state clearly the 
following: — 
1. Grade or subjects to be taught. 
2. Certificate, degree, or preparation required. 
8. Experience required. It should be definitely stated 
in the first letter whether inexperienced, or only experi- 
enced, candidates will be considered. 
4. If the position is one where the local conditions or 
circumstances call for peculiar or unusual abilities this 
should always be stated in the first letter. 
5. Salary offered. 
6. Church membership or preference, if this is im- 
portant. 
7. Time applicant must begin work. 
By carefully and definitely stating in the first letter 
what is required, unnecessary correspondence and delay 
can usually be avoided. 
Most teachers’ agencies send out blanks to be filled in 
by superintendents concerning vacancies or possible 
vacancies. Such blanks, if used, should be gone over 
‘carefully for they are often brief and intended for general 
information only. If these blanks do not provide for 
specific local requirements, or do not fit the situation, 
additional information should be given. 
Application and rating blanks—Many smaller schools, 
as well as large ones, now use printed application and 
rating blanks. The application blank is sent to the appli- 
cant to be filled in and returned by her. If the informa- 
tion given on this blank is satisfactory, rating or 
characterization blanks are sent to those given as refer- 
ences, or to others who know of the applicant’s qualifica- 
tions. Of these blanks there are many different forms in
-P-A-G-E-67
  SELECTING AND EMPLOYING TEACHERS 51 
use. A large number of these have been examined by 
the writer, after which those given on the following pages 
have been compiled to be used here as examples, or to 
serve as models. Similar blanks can be made by almost 
any local printer. As a matter of economy and sim- 
plicity the same blank is ordinarily used for both experi- 
enced and inexperienced teachers. It being understood 
that the items or questions pertaining to teaching experi- 
ence cannot be answered for inexperienced teachers. 
If, after the application blank is filled in and returned 
by the applicant, the applicant seems qualified for the 
position in question, the superintendent or person in 
charge should send rating blanks or communicate as soon 
as possible with those given as references. It is always 
advisable to get a rating concerning an applicant from 
two or more persons. They should be persons who know 
definitely of the applicant’s qualifications, and persons 
who are not likely to misrepresent. the facts. When the 
time is short it may be advisable to send one or more 
of the rating or characterization blanks to the applicant 
together with her application blank, and with instruc- : 
tions to give these blanks to responsible parties to be 
filled in and returned directly to the superintendent. It 
is always advisable to enclose self-addressed, stamped 
envelopes with the rating blanks.

CHAPTER V 
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 
Preparation and experience—The general plan of or- 
ganization and administration is the first and mcst im- 
portant thing that concerns the superintendent who 
comes into a community. It is the general organization 
and methods of administration, more than anything else, 
that will determine his success and characterize the 
schools as good or bad. 
In planning and organizing a school system much is 
involved. It is highly important, therefore, that a would- 
be superintendent equip himself reasonably well educa- 
tionally, and familiarize himself as far as possible with 
the various problems of organization and administration. 
Generally speaking, he should have scholastic prepara- 
tion equivalent to that of the high-school teachers under 
his direction and should have had experience in teaching 
various subjects. If he has had no experience in super- 
vision and administration, he should at least have had 
some special college preparation in administrative work. 
Anyone who cannot meet these requirements should not 
apply for the superintendency of even a small school 
system. It will be much better for him, and for those 
under his direction, to work for one or two years under 
a good experienced superintendent. This in fact is the 
best way to learn something about organization, admin- 
istration, and supervision of schools. In this way he 
55
-P-A-G-E-72
  56 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
may not receive quite so much salary the first year, but 
it is highly probable that he will be happier and that 
his progress and promotion will be both more certain 
and more rapid. 
Reasonable familiarity with various administrative 
problems is of immediate importance, for new situations 
will always arise and some experimentation will always 
be necessary. It is evident, therefore, that unless a super- 
intendent’s previous training and experience have been 
such that he can anticipate and readily understand new 
problems and situations he is likely to meet with failure. 
Experience of more immediate importance than 
scholarship—Advanced scholastic training is generally of 
less immediate importance for a superintendent of a 
small school system than training and experience in ad- 
ministrative problems. Few beginners fail because of 
insufficient general scholastic preparation as compared 
with the number that fail because of errors made in or- 
ganization, administration, and supervision. This does 
not mean that a superintendent of schools need not be 
well educated and scholarly, but that definite and ready 
knowledge concerning his particular duties is of greater 
immediate necessity. 
One may be ever so well versed in history, English, 
mathematics, and foreign languages, but this will not 
help him much when it comes to planning and organiz- 
ing the work of a school system. Mental training and 
expert knowledge in one field cannot be bodily trans- 
ferred and utilized in some other field. Nor does mere 
understanding of principles assure success in their 
application. 
Ability to plan and administer a school system calls
-P-A-G-E-73
  ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 57 
for familiarity with many problems which can be learned 
only on the job, and an administrator’s success will vary 
directly with his understanding of and his familiarity 
with the facts, problems, and conditions involved. 
Much work necessary before schools open—Many a 
failure on the part of an inexperienced superintendent is 
due to the fact that he does not realize what is involved, 
or what is required of him before schools open. He 
arrives upon the scene too late to make the necessary 
study and preparation. He finds the organization work 
and planning of administrative duties to be a much 
greater task than they at first appeared to be. Often 
reorganization and changes are required that bring up 
many unforeseen problems, and a superintendent who 
finds himself with teachers and pupils on hand and with 
his organization and administrative problems unsolved 
is in a precarious predicament. No one, not even an 
experienced man, can take charge of a schoo! system in 
anew community and organize it in a few days. 
To have everything worked out and definitely planned 
beforehand is all-important in getting started well, and 
a good start often means half the battle won. 
Collecting data beforehand—If the planning is to be 
intelligent it is necessary to collect much detailed infor- 
mation beforehand in order that all the factors can be 
weighed and taken into account. The experienced and 
cautious superintendent will inform himself carefully 
as to the ideals and possible demands, the opportunities 
and limitations of a community before applying for the 
superintendency of its schools, and upon election to the 
position of superintendency in a new community he will 
as soon as possible make a careful study of (1) the pre-
-P-A-G-E-74
  58 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
vailing educational ideals and standards held by the peo- 
ple of the community, (2) their past experiences and 
future expectations, (3) the existing social and industrial 
status, (4) the building facilities and general equipment, 
(5) the population and school enrolment, and (6) the 
relative wealth of the community. He will realize that 
these are all fundamental factors which must be taken 
into account in planning the school system, and only in 
the degree that he can interpret these factors can he 
plan intelligently. 
Means to an end—It should be borne in mind also that 
the forms of organization and administration are means 
to an end and in the degree that they are employed 
as ends in themselves they usually fail) as means. No 
scheme or plan will insure efficiency unless it is adopted 
to the particular situation or needs of the community 
and carried out in accordance with these needs. In the 
report of The Cleveland School Survey we read: “No 
form of organization insures efficiency, but there are 
some forms which make efficiency possible and some 
which practically preclude it. There are also forms of 
organization of every intermediate degree of effective- 
ness.” 
High ideals—An experienced superintendent knows 
that unless a community has high ideals and a desire for 
good schools these must be created before good schools 
can be had. He knows also that in bringing about higher 
standards he must gain ground by degrees and carry the 
people along with him. An attempt to force higher 
standards upon a community, or to set standards too 
high or too far ahead of the people will sooner or later 
result in reaction and failure.
-P-A-G-E-75
  
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 59 
Nor is it enough to consider ideals and desires. A com- 
munity may, for example, have high ideals and be very 
desirous of having good schools, but may not have the 
necessary wealth. In such a case the salaries of teachers 
are likely to be and remain low, the buildings poor and 
overcrowded, and the equipment inadequate. Under 
such conditions progress is often impossible, for without 
salaries adequate to secure good teachers, and without 
‘adequate building facilities and supplies good schools 
cannot be established or maintained. 
Knowing who determined educational policy—It is 
important, too, to know whether the educational policies 
of a community are determined by a few leaders or by 
the majority of the citizens. Not infrequently a small 
minority or group of politicians determine the selection 
of those who are to be intrusted with the execution of the 
educational policies. In this way it often happens that 
the real ideals and desires of the majority of the citizens 
are never realized, while a few selfish and unscrupulous 
politicians or propagandists decide how the taxpayer’s 
money is to be spent, and determine the fate of the 
schools. Sometimes short-sighted office seekers secure 
their election to the school board by preaching “Reform” 
or “Economy” concerning matters that they do not un- 
derstand and without making any real effort to under- 
stand them. 
Under such circumstances all a superintendent can 
do is to make the best of it with those in control, and to 
do what he can to bring about gradually a desire to elect 
the best and most influential men to the board of educa- 
tion. General enlightenment and publicity is usually the 
best cure for underhand work. Gradual and tactful
-P-A-G-E-76
  60 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
enlightenment as to what is best for the schools of a 
community can be undertaken by the superintendent at 
once, but general publicity to bring about a reform that 
will be likely to meet with some opposition cannot safely 
be undertaken before there is sufficient interest, power, 
and public sentiment to withstand any probable reaction. 
There are still many communities where the conditions 
described above exist to a greater or less extent, but the 
relative number of places where such policies prevail is 
decreasing. People are becoming more enlightened and 
more concerned about knowing what expenditures are 
necessary and advisable, as well as more insistent in 
knowing where and how their money is being spent. 
Making changes without due consideration—Usually 
when a superintendent is elected to a position because 
the former superintendent failed of reélection he will 
be told by the board members why the former superin- 
tendent in their judgment was not reélected. In this 
way he will learn what is expected of him. It is here 
often where a young, inexperienced man with great hopes 
and aspirations is likely to go to the opposite extreme. 
He should always investigate and verify matters as far as 
possible before advocating or making important changes. 
The former superintendent may have failed to meet rea- 
sonable requirements, but it may also be that his alleged 
shortcomings were due to matters over which he had no 
control. His failure to be reélected may have been due 
to misunderstandings or personal dislikes on the part 
of some one or more board members, influential citizens, 
or politicians. 
It is usually unwise, therefore, for a new man to advo- 
cate or make important changes until he has made a
-P-A-G-E-77
  
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 61 
careful study of the past experiences of the community. 
Not infrequently changes are made the first year by 
inexperienced men that would not have been made had 
they waited and studied the community and the schools 
in operation. No important changes or improvements 
should be attempted before a careful study has been 
made of all the factors involved, both with regard to the 
past and the future. The superintendent should make 
sure that the change contemplated is warranted, and in 
deciding this he should consider the matter from the tax- 
payer’s viewpoint as well as from his own or that of some 
“educational reformer.” He should know whether the pro- 
posed change or improvement is extravagant or really 
economical. It may be expensive and yet economical, 
considering increased efficiency in school work. Parsi- 
mony is not economy if it injures the work of the schools 
of a community. The superintendent should make sure 
also that the community is ready to accept or approve 
the change or improvement contemplated. Many an im- 
portant issue has been defeated by being presented at the 
wrong time. 
Checking with former superintendent, principal, and 
teachers—Where a superintendent is elected to a new 
position for the following school year and before the 
previous school year is over he should, if at all possible, 
make arrangements to visit the schools while they are 
in session, and stay long enough to check with the super- 
intendent, principal, and teachers on the various phases 
of organization, administration, and instruction. If he is 
tactful he will usually be able to get the information 
which he is seeking. 
If he is elected to a position during the summer vaca- 
 
-P-A-G-E-78
  62 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
tion, and this happens not infrequently, he should, if 
possible, arrange to see the former superintendent or 
principal after checking over the records and acquainting 
himself in a general way with the work as carried on 
by them the previous year. It is very probable that there 
will be many questions concerning which they can give 
him ready answers. An hour spent in interviewing a 
former superintendent or principal, with a list of ques- 
tions previously prepared, may clear up matters that 
would require days and even weeks later. If a personal 
interview cannot be had, valuable information can often 
be obtained by correspondence. Teachers living in the 
town or community may also be able to supply helpful 
information about the work of the schools. 
Collecting and recording information—During his 
visit or as soon as possible thereafter a new superintend- 
ent should inform himself with regards to the following 
items: 
1. Enrolment in each of the various grades, including 
the high school. 
2. Number of regular grade teachers and grades or 
combination of grades taught by each. 
8. Special grade teachers and their work as correlated 
with that of the regular teachers. 
4, Departmental or high school teachers and their 
respective work. 
5. Size of classes in the high school and number of 
classes for each teacher. 
6. Length of school day and length of recitation and 
study periods in the various grades and departments. 
7. Special music, literary, and debating work offered, 
and credit allowed for same.
-P-A-G-E-79
  ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 63 
8. Class organizations and athletics. 
9. A sketch of the floor plan should be made at this 
time, showing the relative size and position of the dif- 
ferent rooms on each floor, and the grade or purpose for 
which each is used. 
10. The passing of pupils between classes should be 
noted. 
11. Equipment for industrial and laboratory work 
should be checked on. 
12. Hall, basement, and playground supervision by 
teachers and janitor should be noted. 
13. If the school is consolidated, if there is a junior 
high school organization, normal training department, or 
other special features, these should be studied separately 
and as a whole. 
14. A written record should be made of the above items 
for further study and comparisons. 
After familiarizing himself with this data as per- 
taining to his own school, a comparison should be made 
with a number of similar-sized schools. If schools are 
in session, a beginning superintendent can do no better 
than to visit a number of schools and compare the various 
data under consideration. In this way much can be 
learned. If schools are not in session, it will be well for 
him to interview a few superintendents of similar schools. 
Reference material—A beginning superintendent 
should acquaint and supply himself with good reference 
material. In making his plans he should have a late 
copy of the school laws of the state and read carefully 
the sections or parts covering the particular items or 
phases of' work with which he is concerned at the time 
and with which he is not thoroughly familiar. Informa-  
-P-A-G-E-80

tion pertaining to such matters as the certification of 
teachers, compulsory attendance, and tuition can usually 
be found most readily in the school laws. Practical infor- 
mation can also be obtained from a school directory of 
the state. These directories vary in details, but from the 
data generally given certain prevailing practices can be 
determined by comparing a number of similar-sized school 
systems. Various states now publish manuals with 
courses of study and other valuable information concern- 
ing organization and administration. A few recent school 
surveys should also be on hand for comparison. (See ref- 
erences at end of chapter.) 
Delegating authority—Excepting in very small school 
systems with few teachers, a superintendent cannot him- 
self tend to all detail matters of administration. If he 
attempts to do so he is likely to meet with failure. Hence 
it becomes necessary to delegate various kinds of author- 
ity to the principals, and head teachers. A good super- 
intendent is one who knows what is required and how to 
pick reliable and capable individuals for a given task or 
line of work. An understanding of “line” and “staff” 
organization and their reciprocal advantages is highly 
important, especially to the superintendent of larger 
school systems. Both instruments should be used intelli- 
gently. A line organization may be defined as one headed 
by a chief or captain. Its chief functions are action and 
authority on the part of the leader. The general theory 
of staff organization is that the various departments or 
kinds of work be studied by and left to the authority of 
specialists or experts. Its chief functions are investiga- 
tion and information. Codperation and coérdination, 
however, are necessary under any form of organization.
-P-A-G-E-81
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 65 
In larger school systems there is usually more complete 
departmentalized organization in charge of various prin- 
cipals and special teachers. Here the various teachers of 
the wards and departments are responsible to their re- 
spective principals or special teachers and these in turn 
are held responsible for good results. 
Authority should be delegated in terms of function and 
should be commensurate with the responsibility entailed. 
Responsibility should always be definite and the organ- 
ization and delegation should likewise be definite so that 
there can be no “buck-passing.” In this way only can 
the greatest efficiency be developed and maintained. The 
average individual grows only where he is given responsi- 
bility that cannot be evaded or shifted. 
A good superintendent will be impartial, but direct, 
definite, and firm. He will keep in touch with every part 
of the work and see that it is done. He will have a defi- 
nite purpose and definite plans, and will see to it that 
those to whom administrative authority is delegated un- 
derstand the plans and organization of the system. There 
can be no appreciation without understanding, and 
vagueness of purpose is a great weakness. 
Pupils and classes per teacher—In the grouping and 
sectioning of grade and high school pupils and in the 
organization of classes, it should be borne in mind that, 
other things being equal, the cost per pupil varies in- 
versely with the number of pupils per teacher and per 
class, and the grouping should be made on economic as 
well as social basis. In small schools the per pupil cost 
is usually greater than in large schools because of the 
fact that full-size classes cannot always be maintained. 
This is true especially of small high schools. H. R. Bon-
-P-A-G-E-82
  66 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
ner, Collector and Compiler of Statistics for the Sta- 
tistical Division of the Bureau of Education, in his study 
of 18,951 high schools, made in 1917-18, found that the 
number of high school pupils per teacher in city schools 
averaged 25.4, in village schools 21.3, and in rural 
schools 16.3. 
Number of pupils per class—The best class work can- 
not be done with too few nor with too many pupils, and 
the number that can be taught most efficiently varies 
with the subject taught. In a history class 25 to 30 pupils 
may not be too many. In science laboratory work half 
this number is generally considered a fair-sized class. 
In a bulletin on Standards and Equipment for Ap- 
proved Graded and High Schools, issued by the Depart- 
ment of Public Instruction of Iowa, we read: “No class 
should contain more than 30 students. . . . The number 
of pupils assigned to any grade teacher should never be 
more than 40, and better results will be secured if it does 
not exceed 30. . . . No teacher should have more than 
three grades and preferably not more than two grades.” 
It is safe to say that the ratio should be fewer than 
30 pupils to one teacher rather than more. Smaller 
classes, however, means more classes for a given number 
of teachers so that it becomes a question of relative 
fatigue or endurance on the part of the teacher, and 
again a question of financial ability of the community. 
The teacher’s load also varies with the number of dif- 
ferent preparations per day. In the high school, for 
example, it would be better to have a teacher teach six 
classes per day with two classes covering the same work 
in each of three subjects, than to have her teach five 
classes each covering different work.
-P-A-G-E-83
  
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 67 
Doors and bells—In some places the time of opening 
outside doors and ringing of bells in the morning and at 
noon is published by the board of education in a pam- 
phlet of rules and regulations. If this has not been done, 
the superintendent should make a definite program con- 
cerning these and other important regulations. This pro- 
gram should be submitted to the board of education and 
after its approval by the board such items as the time 
of opening doors and the ringing of outside bells should 
be published in the local papers before the beginning of 
the school year, and whenever it seems advisable there- 
after. Unless a definite time is established the question 
of admitting pupils to the building in the morning and 
at noon may become a troublesome one. Some parents 
are very indifferent or careless about allowing their chil- 
dren to come to school and to congregate on the school 
grounds long before they should arrive. With some 
pupils living near the school building and others living 
several miles out in the country, and with all kinds of 
weather and road conditions it is necessary to have defi- 
nite rules and time limits for admittance to the building. 
In this way only can a superintendent protect himself 
against those parents who are careless about their own 
obligations but who are very exacting and insistent about 
their rights and privileges. 
It may seem unjust to forbid children from coming 
into the school building when they have come from a 
distance in cold and stormy weather and over bad roads, 
and arrive before a regular or designated time. Some 
parents may contend that no rule should prevent children 
from coming into the building when they come from a 
distance, in bad weather and over bad roads. But just 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  68 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
when it is sufficiently cold and stormy for Susie who has 
a “bad cold” or for Amy who is a “very delicate child,” 
and when are the roads sufficiently bad for a given kind 
of conveyance or transportation to justify an exception 
from a rule? It soon becomes evident that unless a defi- 
nite rule or time limit is established and adhered to there © 
will be reasons and excuses of every possible description, 
and the more exceptions or deviations permitted the 
greater the problem becomes. 
In many communities the doors are opened thirty 
minutes before school begins in the morning and fifteen 
minutes before the beginning of the afternoon session. 
In other places they are open during the entire noon 
hour. In making rules concerning the opening of doors 
the relative number of pupils coming from the country, 
the building facilities, the number of pupils staying in 
the building for lunch, and other factors should be care- 
fully considered. 
Parents do not always realize that from the time pupils 
are allowed to enter the building and the various rooms 
in the building some will be in the halls and basement, 
some in the various rooms, while others will remain out 
on the playground. It is obvious then that if teachers are 
to be in their rooms to supervise and help pupils with 
their work, they cannot be assigned to hall, basement, and 
playground supervision. It becomes necessary therefore, 
when pupils are admitted into the building any consid- 
erable time before the opening of the school session that 
they be confined to certain rooms or parts of the building, 
although in this way they cannot well study or prepare 
their lessons which alone justifies their coming early. 
Previous to each session there should be a “thirty-
-P-A-G-E-85
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 69 
minute bell” and a “five-minute bell.” In the high 
school an “assembly bell” should ring at the moment of 
opening, and a system of classroom bells or signals should 
be kept in good working order. 
Morning and noon-hour regulations—Pupils should 
not be allowed to congregate in front of the outside doors 
of the school building before the regular time of opening 
the doors in the morning and at noon. Upon entering 
the building they should not be allowed to congregate or 
group in the toilet rooms or halls, but should be required 
to go to their respective rooms or to designated rooms. 
High school pupils should go directly to the assembly 
room or to the classrooms where they meet the first pe- 
riod and where their teachers should be at this time. 
All pupils living or boarding within reasonable walking 
- distance from the school building should be required to 
_ go home for their lunch at noon, excepting for good and 
sufficient reasons to the contrary. All pupils remaining 
at the building should be required to eat in some desig- 
nated room in the basement or on the first floor. They 
should not be allowed to wander or run about in the 
building or to run in and out of the building. In smaller 
schools where not many children bring their lunch or 
remain at the building during the noon hour they are 
often left to the care of the janitor, but where a con- 
siderable number remain at the building teachers should 
take turns in staying with them. In good weather pupils 
should not remain in the school building during the noon 
hour. 
Supervision of playgrounds, halls, and gymnasium— 
Wherever and whenever there are a considerable number 
of children on the playground, in the basement, halls, or  
-P-A-G-E-86
  70 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
gymnasium there should be supervision or oversight, to 
prevent any serious friction, bad language, rough sports, 
quarreling or other improper conduct. Grade teachers 
should be with their pupils during recesses. A program 
with definite assignments should be carefully worked out 
and copies should be given to teachers or posted in one or 
more places. The details of such a program will, of 
course, depend on buildings, equipment, and various 
other factors. One or more teachers may be given assign- 
ments during the noon hour for a day or a week at a time 
while others may be given assignments for mornings and 
evenings, or the various teachers may be given certain 
assignments indefinitely. Where many children stay at 
the school building during the noon hour two teachers 
may be required to stay at the building for a day or a 
week at a time. In this the superintendent should also 
take his turn. Nothing will better enable him to know 
what supervision is necessary and to give proper direc- 
tions to teachers. 
It is important to make definite assignments wherever 
supervision is required so that there can be definite re- 
sponsibility. It will be found that the more carefully 
the program is worked out and followed the less there will 
be to do. Such a program does not mean that teachers 
on duty should stand or remain continuously at a desig- 
nated place to police the children, but rather that they 
lead them in good wholesome play. The freedom of 
children in play should not be restricted any more than 
is necessary, but all games should be clean and free from 
danger. 
Passing to and from classrooms—In the high school 
and in departmentalized grade work where pupils pass
-P-A-G-E-87
  
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 71 
from one room to another between periods, a definite 
system for passing should be worked out, and should be 
adhered to by all teachers. In vocational and science 
laboratory work, as well as in other regular class work 
all members of the class should be dismissed at the same 
time, and when the class is required to go from one floor 
to another the teacher should be with the pupils when 
they pass. 
It is true that well-behaved classes under the direction 
of good teachers in a well-organized school will not need 
constant supervision or watching, and should be placed 
upon their own responsibility as far as possible; but in 
the average school, sooner or later, some pupils will 
always take undue advantages unless they are supervised, 
and some teachers are always inclined to adopt a “laissez 
faire” policy concerning these matters, until uncontroll- © 
able problems have arisen. It is better, therefore, in the 
long run, to have definite requirements with regard to 
supervision over the passing of all classes, and to allow 
pupils as much freedom, under supervision or oversight, 
as is consistent with good order and conduct. With 
_ teachers who are good disciplinarians there will need be 
little restriction. But it should be remembered that not 
all teachers are good disciplinarians, and some rules may 
well be adhered to by all teachers as a means to aid the 
| weaker teacher. 
In some high schools, and especially in the larger ones, 
pupils having recitations the first period in the morning 
and the first period in the afternoon are required to go 
directly to their classrooms, instead of going to the assem- 
bly room first. The teachers of these classes are then 
required to act as “roll-call teachers” for their respective 
 
-P-A-G-E-88
  72 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
groups, and report all cases of absence or tardiness to the 
principal at the end of the day. Where the building and 
classroom arrangements are poor such a plan prevents 
congestion and confusion, and where the assembly room 
is small this plan often becomes necessary. In some 
schools it may be advisable to have only such classes as 
manual training and domestic science go directly to their 
rooms, or those classes that meet in different buildings. 
Much will depend upon the building arrangements and 
facilities. 
Where the assembly room is large enough to accom- 
modate all pupils, and where the various classrooms are 
on the same floor or within reasonable accessibility from 
the assembly room, the plan described above is not very 
common in smaller school systems. One of the chief ob- 
jections to the plan is that pupils will be obliged to carry 
with them the text books, papers, etc., needed for these 
classes, or go to the assembly room for them before the 
class period. Another objection is that it makes impos- 
sible general opening exercises or announcements in- 
tended for all. Furthermore, many superintendents hold 
that a grouping of all pupils once or twice per day, if 
only for a few minutes, is a valuable means to promoting 
interest and maintaining a good school spirit. 
The consolidated school—If the school system is con- 
solidated, the various problems and requirements peculiar 
to consolidation must be studied and met. Consolidation 
is no longer an experiment, and there is now available 
much good literature on the organization and adminis- 
tration of consolidated schools. After a thorough check- 
ing has been made on state regulations and requirements,
-P-A-G-E-89
  ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 73 
it is well to visit a few consolidated school plants of 
similar size, in order to get first-hand information on the 
practical side. Here, as in all school work, the most effec- 
tive way to learn how to solve a practical problem is to 
visit one or more similar schools and consult with those 
in charge and those who have solved similar problems. 
The course of study in a consolidated school may not 
differ much from that of other schools. The following 
considerations, however, will likely affect the organiza- 
tion directly or indirectly and may need special attention: 
1. In an agricultural community there will probably be 
more interest in such subjects as agriculture and manual 
arts, which may call for more work and justify a rela- 
tively greater expenditure of money for this purpose. 
2. The classification and grading of pupils will likely 
be a greater problem, especially during the first year of 
consolidation when pupils enter who have been attending 
different schools of varying standards of efficiency. 
3. There may be more absence and irregular attend- 
ance during the busy farming season. This may make it 
advisable to have a longer spring vacation and a shorter 
Christmas vacation. It may also become necessary to 
divide classes in certain subjects into two sections each 
for the benefit of those who are obliged to be absent, 
and to provide for additional classes during the time that 
this work is being made up. 
4, The problem of transportation will be an important 
one and will vary considerably with communities. The 
transportation of many children over country roads 
necessitates a program under which all regular work can 
be completed and all classes dismissed at the same time 
 
-P-A-G-E-90
7 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
in the afternoon. Such a program means longer days for 
small children which calls for special care and attention 
to the recreation of these children. 
It may not be wise, especially during the winter 
months, to emphasize special or elective work in music, 
debating, literary work, or physical training to be done 
before nine in the morning or after four in the afternoon. 
Somewhat more “home work” would therefore seem 
justifiable. 
5. There will probably be a larger number of pupils 
remaining at the school building during the noon hour. 
It may be more expedient, therefore, to have a somewhat 
shorter noon hour and to have hot lunch served by the 
domestic science department. 
The junior high school—A junior high school or inter- 
mediate school organization also brings with it special 
problems in organization and administration. Where 
there is such an organization in the system it should, of 
course, be studied as such, and should be so planned as 
to give the pupil every reasonable advantage. 
A junior high school or intermediate school usually 
includes the seventh-, eighth-, and ninth-year pupils, and 
calls for departmentalized teaching. It should be re- 
membered, however, that departmentalized teaching 
alone does not make a junior high school. In some 
schools, but more especially in larger systems, depart- 
mentalized teaching is carried on successfully below the 
seventh grade. Where the building and other facilities 
are adequate, and especially where there are more pupils 
in a grade than can be taught by one teacher or in one 
room, a junior high school organization or department- 
alized teaching may be advisable. The organization may
-P-A-G-E-91
ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 15 
not be complete in the sense that one teacher teaches only 
one subject or line of work. The work of two grades, 
for example, may be divided among three teachers. For 
the average smaller school system there is probably as 
much to be said against as for a separate junior high 
school organization, or complete departmentalized 
teaching. 
Many leading educators hold that it is better for the 
pupil, and in the long run better for the teacher to have 
her teach the majority of the subjects in a given grade. 
In this way she learns to know the pupils better, and can 
better discover and provide for special abilities or short- 
comings. She can better hold a pupil responsible for his 
progress in the work of the grade as a whole, and a super- 
intendent can better hold the teacher responsible for the 
progress of the grade. This may be said to apply more 
especially to grades below the seventh, but it applies in 
a measure also to the seventh and eighth grades. 
The following is quoted from Common Sense School 
Supervision by Charles A. Wagner, Superintendent 
of Schools, Chester, Pennsylvania: “The one-room 
one-teacher plan has its strength in the fact that it satis- 
fies the child’s feeling of unity of his consciousness and 
supplies his developmental need to see the relatedness of 
ideas, both within the specialty and of the specialty with 
other branches. No system which runs to specialized 
teaching in the grades can be even tolerably satisfactory 
in this respect. The frequent change of teachers during 
the school day, now for one specialty now for another, 
does not give the child the consciousness of unity and 
continuity of experience and of learning, nor does it ever 
enable him to see the relatedness of knowledge unless he
-P-A-G-E-92
  76 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
discovers it for himself. ... The special teacher will 
not admit and will not assume responsibility for instruc- 
tion of correlation with other subjects with her specialty 
except incidentally, which is accidentally, which is almost 
never.” In fact it may be said that there are often dis- 
tinct disadvantages as well as advantages in depart- 
mentalization. 
The writer is in full accord with the views expressed 
by the Council of the Iowa State Teachers Association: 
“We recognize that too great emphasis has been placed 
on the formal aspects of Junior High Schools, for ex- 
ample, segregation of grades, complete departmentaliza- 
tion, and length of recitation periods.” 
In a regular junior high school there should be two 
or more parallel courses or whatever elective and optional 
courses are deemed advisable or necessary to meet the 
different needs and capacities of the pupils. Both the 
work in the lower grades and that in the senior high 
school should be kept in mind. The course of study 
should be so arranged that the pupil can pursue one or 
two lines of practical work which constitute complete 
units in themselves for these years. The course as a 
whole, however, should be such that it will in no way 
tend to prevent or hinder the pupil’s further work in 
the senior high school. Here, also, it will be well to 
collect courses of study from a number of junior high or 
intermediate school organizations. 
Economy—Economy is an important factor in the or- 
ganization of all school work. The program as a whole 
should be so arranged that it will result in the greatest 
possible economy of time and effort on the part of both 
pupils and teachers. This means that all classes must
-P-A-G-E-93
  ORGANIZATION AND ADMINISTRATION 77 
be full size as nearly as practicable; that teachers and 
pupils must be supplied in due time with all necessary 
books, supplies, and equipment, and that all daily work 
must be definitely planned and organized. 
All materials, equipment and apparatus should be on 
hand and in order before the regular class work begins. 
There should be a definite system for the passing of 
classes and for the distribution and collection of supplies, 
materials, etc. Lessons requiring the setting up of appa- 
ratus on the part of the teacher should, if practicable, be 
conducted during the first period in the morning or after- 
noon, or at such a time that the teacher can have every- 
thing ready at the beginning of the class period. In the 
lower grades pupils may be appointed to act as monitors 
in distributing and collecting supplies and materials, 
cleaning blackboards, ete. 
Note——Throughout this book where the word “Superintendent” 
is used when speaking of administrative or supervisory duties, the 
writer has in mind a school system in which the superintendent 
usually does some teaching and has general administrative and 
supervisory charge of both the elementary grades and the high 
school. Where the system is sufficiently large to require a superin- 
tendent of grades, and a principal chiefly or exclusively in charge 
of the high school, the administrative and supervisory duties are 
likewise divided. Here matters pertaining to the high school will, 
of course, come under the jurisdiction of the principal rather than 
under the superintendent. This should be borne in mind in con- 
sidering the latter type of school system. 
In some parts of the country the head of a small school system, 
including both grades and high school, is commonly known as the 
principal.

  CHAPTER VI 
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 
State regulations—State, county, and municipal au- 
thorities set up various requirements to be met in making 
programs of studies. Some states have detailed programs 
worked out, while others have only a general outline. 
Where the state program is less complete the details are 
more commonly worked out by counties and prescribed 
by county superintendents and boards of education. In 
the larger cities local boards usually control education to 
a greater extent, under special charters and in accordance 
with state laws. 
The state usually controls such matters as: 
. The organization of school districts 
. Selection of officers 
. Levying of taxes 
. Certification of teachers 
. Compulsory attendance 
Length of school year 
Minimum requirements in various subjects 
Minimum equipment 
. Maintenance 
Many states also control or regulate the following: 
1. The subjects to be taught in the various grades 
2. The amount of subject-matter to be covered 
3. The text books to be used 
79 OMNAMARWHe
-P-A-G-E-96

4. The length of recitation periods 
5. The maximum number of pupils per room or per 
class 
6. The maximum number of classes per teacher 
7. The examinations to be given 
A carefully worked-out state program of studies repre- 
sents a study of essentials. Such a program is usually 
based on the evolution and practices of many school 
systems, and is a positive and determining factor in bring- 
ing about economy and efficiency. It gives a definite 
idea of the work required in each branch by setting up 
clearly defined objectives and goals. It also guards 
against neglect or overemphasis of certain subject-matter 
as well as against attacks by short-sighted local authori- 
ties, and against too frequent changes. In the words of 
Charles A. Murray, “A course of study which gives us 
the typical and essential in the vast field will be a price- 
less economy.” 
Some states have courses of study with manuals for 
teachers that have been prepared primarily for rural and 
district schools and with a view to help especially the 
inexperienced teacher. Other states have programs of 
studies and manuals for both elementary and high 
schools. Some of these contain many excellent sugges- 
tions for classroom organization and the presentation of 
subject-matter, as well as for making a course of study 
for a given community. 
Adjusting the program of studies to meet local re- 
quirements—A state course of study may be theoretically 
correct and yet fall far short of meeting local require- 
ments. For a particular community, village, or town such 
a course may be, not only inadequate or impractical, but,
-P-A-G-E-97
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 81 
if too detailed and rigid, may even be a hinderance. This, 
however, is not likely to be true of a well-planned and 
carefully worked-out program. Quite a number of states 
now have excellent courses of study in which the possi- 
bility of this is clearly recognized and guarded against. 
To quote from the Indiana Manual With Course of Study 
for the Elementary Schools, “The Course of Study states 
what should be taught under normal conditions. It is 
the problem of the superintendent to adjust it to his 
local condition.” Likewise we read in the Missouri State 
Course of Study, “Some teachers will find it necessary to 
supplement the course; others may be compelled to omit 
some parts. ... The course is not to be followed so 
slavishly as to make it a hinderance to effective work but 
it is to be a guide and a support.” Similar statements 
appear in a number of other state courses of study. 
Every community has its own local peculiarities which 
must be met by particular provisions. The local pro- 
gram of studies, if it is progressive, is in a measure an 
evolution or growth which has come about to meet vary- 
ing and conflicting needs and which has been affected 
more or less by particular and changing conditions. 
It is evident that a detailed and rigid state course of 
study, no matter how progressive it may be in its general 
provisions, cannot wholly meet local requirements. It is 
equally evident, therefore, that no definite or complete 
set of rules can be laid down for making a course of 
study that will fit all school systems of a given size or 
type. The requirements will vary with the state and the 
locality in the state, with the size of the school system, 
and with changing conditions. 
Much preliminary work necessary—The making of a
-P-A-G-E-98
82 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
good program of studies for a given school system is an 
important undertaking and is no small task. It calls 
for understanding and foresight and a knowledge of many 
details. It cannot be done in a few days, and no one 
should attempt to do it in a limited time just before 
schools are to be opened in the fall of the year. Those 
who have had little or no experience in program making 
will be very likely to underestimate the time and amount 
of preliminary work it requires. 
A superintendent who is new in the field will need to 
familiarize himself with the various problems and phases 
of program making, and in order to do this intelligently 
he must know how and where to obtain helpful informa- 
tion and reference material. He should know which sub- 
jects are required by state and local authorities as well 
as the chief aim and purpose of these subjects. Likewise 
he should know something about the placement of sub- 
jects with respect to age and grade of pupils, and the 
relative time that should be allotted to each. 
A careful reading of the following generalizations and 
recommendations will reveal various typical and essential 
considerations that are involved in making a program of 
studies, and will point out typical problems and possible 
solutions. The courses of study and tables at the end of 
the chapter will serve to show roughly the general prac- 
tice. They may be used as guides in making a program 
for a given community. The references also have been 
selected with a view to give practical and direct addi- 
tional information. 
Relative value of different subjects—In making a pro- 
gram of study for a group of normal children we must 
take into account the interests, needs, and activities of
-P-A-G-E-99
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 83 
both child and adult life. Charters, in speaking of this 
two-fold consideration says, “Here, as always in educa- 
tional problems, we have two forces which act together 
to determine the order of the curriculum; neither alone 
will produce a well-balanced product. The adult cur- 
riculum must be adapted to child needs and abilities, and 
children’s interests must be molded by a consideration of 
the problems which they will face as adults.” + 
Many subjects have intrinsic and derived values as 
well as specific and disciplinary values, and may serve as 
means to a variety of different ends. The value of any 
subject to a given group of pupils will depend on how 
it is taught and studied, and on its practical application 
or the number of situations to the welfare of these indi- 
viduals and of mankind. Generally speaking, knowledge 
of principles and fundamentals is worth more than 
knowledge of facts and derivatives. 
In the words of Thorndike: “One reason for the diffi- 
culty of decision about the relative value of studies is 
the fact that they are means to such different purposes 
and ends. It is hard to balance 10 per cent improve- 
ment in health against 4 per cent improvement in 
intellect.” 2 
Time allotment—A study of time allotment as shown 
by different state and city courses reveals the fact that 
there is considerable lack of agreement and uniformity 
in the use of terms, with respect to subject-matter in- 
cluded under a given term. Hence many of the recom- 
mendations and studies on time allotment are not com- 
parable. The term Reading for example, may or may not

include one or all of the following: Word-study, Phonics, 
Pronunciation, Literature, Composition, and Grammar. 
Again, one or all of these may be included under 
Language. History may include Civics, Current Events, 
and Citizenship, or these may all be taught under Open- 
ing Exercises. Likewise, Science and Nature-study may 
include a variety of different subject-matter. 
In some of the tabulations of programs showing time 
allotment the subjects or topics included under the vari- 
ous terms are specified. This makes it possible to com- 
pare and to average the results of a number of such 
tabulations. The table on page 96 shows the averages of 
allotment by subjects and grades compiled from a num- 
ber of state and city programs which were found to be 
sufficiently specific and comparable. 
Elective subjects in intermediate and high schools— 
It is often a difficult matter to decide what subjects 
should be offered as elective, but a decision must be 
made. Small schools should not undertake to offer too 
many elective subjects with an inadequate number of 
teachers. Communities desiring to offer electives should 
understand that unless the enrolment is such that there 
can be full-size classes, and that the teachers are prepared 
to teach the additional subjects, such a program is costly 
and likely to be inefficient. A community must be will- 
ing to meet the additional cost if the work of such a pro- 
gram is to be kept at a high standard. The following 
paragraph is quoted from an announcement circular con- 
cerning programs of recognized high schools in the state 
of Illinois: 
“A two-year high school must ordinarily have a 
fixed and prescribed course of eight units all of which
-P-A-G-E-101
  
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 85 
and no other must be taken by each pupil. In nearly all 
recognized two-year high schools all the classes are taught 
by one person and his full teaching time should be given 
to these classes. Any variation from this rule must be 
for good reasons and upon written approval from the 
Supervisor of High Schools. If electives are offered there 
must be an assistant teacher. The same thing is true 
of three-year high schools (taught by two teachers) and 
of four-year high schools (taught by three teachers).” 
In the larger high schools there are usually a number 
of elective studies and two or more courses from which 
pupils may select. Wherever possible, these courses of 
study should be so planned that pupils can change from 
one to another at the end of the first or second year with- 
out loss of time. Pupils should not be allowed, however, 
to change from one course to another unless there are 
good reasons for doing so and then only with the consent 
of parents and principal or superintendent. 
Sequence—The most natural and economical sequence 
of learning in all subject-matter should be carefully 
studied and provided for, as far as possible, in the pro- 
gram of studies. The sequence of the more common 
subjects is usually prescribed by the state, county, or 
city regulations. In many instances and under normal 
conditions the best sequence or order is obvious and 
requires little thought or study. But in the case of 
various elective subjects and under unusual circum- 
stances it is sometimes difficult to determine which sub- 
ject should be studied first. It frequently happens that 
one or more members of a grade or class in departmental- 
ized or high school work have taken subjects out of their 
regular order, or have been obliged to repeat certain sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
86 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
jects which has thrown them off the regular schedule. 
Furthermore, in small schools certain subjects can be 
offered only every alternate year. This often makes it 
necessary to compromise on the order of placement of 
one or more subjects or on thé subjects to be offered dur- 
ing a given semester. 
General requirements—The program of studies should 
contain subject-matter that will further or promote the 
following: (a) health habits and physical development, 
(b) wholesome recreation, (c) knowledge and skill, 
(d) appreciations and ideals, (e) industry and vocational 
efficiency, (f) moral and civic efficiency. The program 
should provide, as far as practicable, for the greatest good 
to the greatest number, but should make provisions for 
exceptional or bright pupils, as weil as for slow or sub- 
normal pupils. It should consider the regular prescribed 
work for a grade or class as a body of basic and suitable 
subject-matter to be studied by all, rather than for a 
group of pupils of like abilities. In short, the program 
must be flexible enough to be workable with a reasonable 
range of different abilities, and progressive enough to 
change with changing conditions. On the other hand, it 
must be specific and set up definite requirements to be 
adhered to by all if it is to be of any great value. 
Charters lays down the following general rules for the 
construction of the curriculum: 
“First, determine the major objectives of education by 
a study of the life of man in its social setting. 
“Second, analyze these objectives into ideals and ac- 
tivities and continue the analysis to the level of working 
units. 
“Third, arrange these in the order of importance.
-P-A-G-E-103
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 87 
“Fourth, raise to positions of higher order in this list 
those ideals and activities which are high in value for 
children but low in value for adults. 
“Fifth, determine the number of the most important 
items of the resulting list which can be handled in the 
time allotted to school education, after deducting those 
which are better learned outside of school. 
“Sixth, collect the best practices of the race in handling 
these ideals and activities. 
“Seventh, arrange the material so obtained in proper 
instructional order, according to the psychological nature 
of children.” ® 
Information to be obtained before planning a pro- 
gram—tThe following procedure is recommended for ob- 
taining preliminary information necessary to intelligent 
planning of a program of studies for a given community 
or school system: 
1. If the program of studies is for a school or school 
system in a place to which you have been elected for the 
following year, visit the schools if possible while they are 
in session, and obtain or make a copy of the program for 
each of the grades and departments. Study these care- 
fully and talk over anything that is not clear to you 
with the superintendent, principal, or teachers. If the 
schools are not in session and if an interview with the 
former superintendent or principal cannot be had, obtain 
from the records and with the help of board members or 
former teachers who may be in the community all the 
information you can get concerning last year’s program. 
You will need a record of all important items in planning 
your program. 
*?W. W. Charters, Curriculum Construction, p. 102. 
 
-P-A-G-E-104
  88 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
2. Make a record of the number of grade teachers and 
high school teachers, of the number of pupils in each 
grade or year, and of any combinations or divisions of 
grades and classes. 
3. Find out, if possible, whether the program of studies 
as carried out in the past has met with the approval of 
the patrons of the school, or whether a change has been 
sought or advocated. 
4, Where a state or county course of study is followed, 
obtain a copy as early as possible and study it carefully 
before planning the details for your program of studies. 
If there is a course of study worked out in the school 
system compare it with the state or county course to see 
that it meets all requirements. 
5. Collect and study the programs followed by a num- 
ber of similar-sized school systems in the state and county 
in which your school is located. From these practical 
suggestions can often be obtained. 
6. Collect for comparison and reference purposes copies 
of a few different state courses of study and reports of a 
few recent school surveys. In these much valuable in- 
formation will be found pertaining to programs of studies, 
supervision of teaching, organization, classification of 
pupils, and possible standards of attainment in classroom 
work. See references at end of chapter. 
7. If a normal training course is offered in the system, 
obtain a copy of the regulations and requirements and 
check carefully with this in planning your program of 
studies for the high school. 
8. If manual training, domestic arts, agriculture, and 
other vocational subjects are offered, familiarize yourself 
with the requirements as to the subject-matter to be
-P-A-G-E-105
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 89 
covered, placement of subjects, and length of periods. 
In state-aided schools these requirements are often quite 
exacting and very definitely prescribed. But in any 
school system the subject-matter of these courses, the 
necessary equipment, the time allotment, and length of 
periods should be carefully considered and planned. 
9. Note how provisions are made in the program for 
double periods in laboratory work and whether this work 
is alternated with other classroom work. 
10. Make a record of the number of times a week 
that such subjects as music, penmanship, drawing, hy- 
giene, citizenship, etc., are taught, and of the way these 
subjects are alternated with other subjects. 
11. Make a study of the optional and elective subjects 
offered in the departmentalized grades or high school, 
and of the correlation of the double periods in the science 
and vocational subjects with the single periods in the 
regular academic work. 
12. Without a thorough acquaintance with the pro- 
gram of the previous year, with the text books used, and 
with the equipment available, it is generally unwise for a 
new man to make important changes, and quite impossi- 
ble to plan improvements. 
13. If upon a thorough investigation and study of the 
preceding items a newly elected superintendent finds that 
the school system has a good course of study and a com- 
plete set of records, he is very fortunate. He will then 
need to do little immediate constructive work along this 
line. Minor changes, however, will be required every 
year, and it may be said, finally, that program making 
should be a continuous process. He should, therefore, 
familiarize himself with all important matters pertaining
-P-A-G-E-106
  90 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
to the program of study. Often there is neither a good 
course of study worked out nor an adequate system of 
records, and especially is this true in places where an 
inexperienced man is most likely to obtain his first posi- 
tion as superintendent. 
How to proceed to make daily grade programs—A 
first rough or tentative outline or plan for daily programs 
of the grades may be made as follows: 
1. Determine from the enrollment of each grade as 
shown by the reports and data obtained from last year’s 
program, the number of rooms or regular grade teachers 
for which programs will be required; also the combina- 
tions or divisions that will be necessary. 
2. With the data of last year’s program as a guide 
determine the length of the school day and the total time 
to be allotted to recesses and recreational periods. 
8. On a separate sheet of paper write down for each of 
the rooms or for each of the regular teachers the grade or 
grades that are represented. 
4. Determine and record the length of the opening 
exercise periods. 
5. Determine the number and length of recesses and 
recreation periods. Place these tentatively on the pro- 
gram sheet. 
6. Determine the total time available for recitation 
and study in each grade, in both the forenoon and the 
afternoon. 
7. Determine the subjects that are to be taught in the 
new program of studies and place tentatively the main 
subjects, indicating in each case the total time allotment 
for study and recitation. The subjects that are to be 
taught twice a day should be placed on both the fore-
-P-A-G-E-107
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 91 
noon and afternoon section of the program. Divisions 
of large groups for certain recitations must be kept in 
mind and provided for. 
8. Place the minor subjects and those that are alter- 
nated with other subjects during the week, indicating 
probable time allotment. 
9. Arrange the recitation and study periods of the 
various subjects with respect to time and sequence. The 
study periods should be long enough for pupils to pre- 
pare their next lesson. 
10. If there is a special teacher for music, penmanship, 
etc., or that the work is departmentalized, the order and 
arrangement of subjects must be so that the work done 
by special teachers will come at different times in the 
various rooms. In order to prevent conflicts it may be 
advisable to place these subjects first (tentatively). 
11. If there are too many recitation periods a day, 
reduce them by combinations and alternations. 
12. Much shifting may be required before a permanent . 
program can be worked out, but many shifts and arrange- 
ments are usually possible. The important thing is that 
a good program be worked out within a reasonable time, 
and that in the meantime all are kept busy and happy. 
How to proceed to make a daily high school program 
—tThe following steps are suggested for making a tenta- 
tive program for the high school: 
1. Determine from the data obtained from last year’s 
program the number of pupils that will probably be en- 
rolled in each year, and the divisions, combinations, and 
alternations that will be necessary. 
2. Determine the length of the school day, and divide 
the day into the number of periods desired.
-P-A-G-E-108
  92 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
3. Determine the subjects that are to be offered in 
your program of studies, and the number of teachers that 
will be required. 
4. Rule a sheet of paper with horizontal lines for the 
periods of the day, and with vertical columns for the 
various teachers. 
5. At the top of these columns write the names of the 
teachers, and under these names, on the different hori- 
zontal lines, place the subjects that are to be taught by 
the respective teachers. 
6. In a vertical column to the left of the sheet place 
the time of the various periods. 
7. The various recitation periods must be so dis- 
tributed that the “free” or “unassigned” periods of the 
different groups throughout the day can be properly 
cared for. This must be taken into account especially 
where the assembly room is small or where certain classes 
must recite in the assembly room. Where there are 
supervised study periods in the recitation rooms there 
will, of course, be fewer pupils in the general assembly 
room. 
8. Place first the required, daily subjects and those 
that will probably be most difficult to correlate with 
other subjects. In such subjects as physics, manual 
training, and cooking the classes must be relatively small, 
and this means that here groups are more often divided 
into two sections. Since these subjects require double 
periods for laboratory work on certain days of the week 
they must be so placed that at least some of this work 
ean be correlated with that of other subjects. Two or 
more divisions or sections of a given grade or year, may, 
of course, be placed on the same line for work under|
-P-A-G-E-109
  THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 93 
different teachers. In case of supervised study periods, 
which are usually longer, laboratory subjects may be so 
placed that two of these periods will coincide with three 
regular periods. See program for Anita High School, 
page 102. 
9. Subjects taught two or three times a week can 
often be placed so as to alternate with the laboratory 
work of the other days. 
10. The recitation and study periods for the various 
groups, should, as far as practicable, be so arranged that 
each pupil will have roughly an equal amount of time for 
study and recitation in both the forenoon and the 
afternoon. 
11. The program of studies must be so planned that 
every pupil can take four or more regular subjects each 
semester. This is not always an easy matter in small 
schools, since not infrequently one or more capable 
pupils, who have failed to make credits in certain subjects 
through sickness or for other reasons, will need an addi- 
tional subject in order to complete their work with the 
class. In a measure this can be cared for by rotating 
certain elective subjects every second or third year in 
order to have one or more subjects that can be taken 
by pupils in different years. 
12. Provisions for special work in music, literary so- 
cieties, etc., must also be kept in mind. 
Teachers should have a part in making programs of 
studies—While the planning of programs with respect to 
the more important items usually falls directly upon the 
superintendent in smaller school systems, it is generally 
well for him to make the program only temporary or 
tentative with respect to minor details before consulting
-P-A-G-E-110
    94 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
with the teachers. This is true especially of programs 
for grades where one teacher has charge of all or the 
greater part of the work in a room. Teachers in these 
grades should be encouraged to help plan a tentative 
program, to try it out for a few days, and then to suggest 
any changes or improvements. Where the teacher has 
had charge of the work the previous year, she will, of 
course, have a definite program in mind and will need to 
consider only improvements or changes recommended by 
the superintendent. Older and experienced grade teach- 
ers should always have a part in the making of a program 
for their work, especially with respect to the arrangement 
of details and placement of subjects. The high school 
principal, if she is experienced, and especially if she has 
been in the system for one or more years, should have an 
important part in the making of the high school program. 
Other high-school teachers should be consulted concern- 
ing their part of the program. They should not, however, 
be allowed to decide matters or to dictate. A superin- 
tendent who tolerates this will soon find himself quite 
unnecessary as far as program making and assignments 
are concerned. 
On the other hand teachers and principals will gen- 
erally be better satisfied with a program which they have 
helped to make. Not infrequently much tact and 
diplomacy are required in making a program and assign- 
ments satisfactory to all teachers. 
When the various details of a program have been 
worked out with the aid of teachers and principal, alll 
should adhere to it. There should be a copy of the daily 
program in every grade room and a copy of the daily 
high school program in the high school assembly room,
-P-A-G-E-111
THE PROGRAM OF STUDIES 95 
Duplicate copies of these should be kept in the superin- 
tendent’s office. 
Values derived from following a definite program—A 
well-planned daily program covering the work in all 
grades, with specified time allotment for study periods 
as well as recitation periods in each grade, is highly im- 
portant in bringing about the best results. Such a pro- 
gram is an excellent servant when kept workable and up 
to date, and if followed closely and consistently (except- 
ing for good reasons to the contrary) may be said to 
accomplish the following: 
1. It will teach habits of punctuality. 
2. It will tend to develop order and self-control on the 
part of pupils by providing a definite time for doing each 
required task, and in this way to lead to a more careful 
preparation of daily lessons. 
8. It sets up definite requirements that cannot be dis- 
regarded by teachers or pupils. 
4, It saves time and energy on the part of pupils and 
teacher. 
5. It guards against whims or hobbies and against over- 
emphasis or neglect of certain subjects on the part of the 
teacher. 
6. It avoids confusion and brings about a more orderly 
and studious atmosphere. 
It should be said, however, that no program will take 
the place of a thoughtful teacher, and no program should 
be followed slavishly or blindly. But whenever it be- 
comes necessary for a teacher to change her regular pro- 
gram she should take the matter up with the superin- 
tendent beforehand and obtain his consent to have the 
change made, especially if the change is to be permanent 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
    
96 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
or where it involves other teachers. Any permanent 
change should be recorded on both the program in the 
teacher’s room and on the duplicate in the office. 
Time allotment by subjects and grades—The follow- 
ing table is a summary compilation made from the time 
allotments suggested in (1) state courses of study or

of those given in these various courses and studies. In 
a few instances single items had to be disregarded in 
determining averages since the terminology of subject- 
matter included was indefinite, or was such that it did not 
seem advisable to average the figures with those of the 
other studies. (The figures represent minutes per week.) 
Subjects Taught in Junior High Schools 
The following table shows the distribution of subjects 
offered in 128 cities purporting to have junior high 
schools. The table was arranged by H. C. Hines at the 
University of Iowa. It is a summary of data collected 
by Supt. C. C. Bingaman of Goldfield, Iowa. The 128 
cities represented are located in 31 different states. It 
was found that the periods in the schools represented 
ranged from 20 to 60 minutes in length, and that 98 of 
these schools claimed to have some sort of supervised 
study. The schools offering Spanish were largely con- 
fined to the southern states.

of the gymnasium and playground for correction and 
development. In general, in this plan, the constants are 
expected to occupy three-fourths or nearly three-fourths 
of the time and energy of all pupils; therefore, one-fourth 
or more of the time and energy of the pupil will be given 
to the elective, vocational subjects.” 
High School Requirements 
The following is taken from a pamphlet, Standards 
and Equipment for Approved Graded and High Schools, 
issued by the Department of Public Instruction, Des 
Moines, Iowa, 1921. 
“A high school course must provide for the following 
units in the course of study. A unit consists of one sub- 
ject pursued for 36 weeks of 5 periods per week for 
40 minutes each. Manual Training, Home Economics, 
Agriculture, General Science and Physics should have 
double periods for laboratory work (80 minutes), Manual 
Training and Home Economics each day and the other 
subjects twice a week.

Note. The above has been taken from the Nebraska State Course of 
Study (1920 Edition). To quote, “The program is so arranged that tran- 
sition from one school to another of higher grade is easy... . The list of 
electives make a sufficiently wide range to fit the needs of any community. 
We do not advise the teaching of home economics and manual training 
unless the school has sufficient equipment to insure good work. The smaller 
schools should have a single course, all pupils taking the same work.”

  CHAPTER VII 
PROBLEMS AND PRINCIPLES IN PROGRAM MAKING 
AND CLASSROOM ORGANIZATION 
In addition to determining the subjects to be taught, 
the placement of these subjects, the time allotment, etc., 
there are usually various problems in classroom organiza- 
tion that must be taken into account in planning a daily 
program; and here also certain principles should be 
observed. A few of the more or less typical of these prob- 
lems and leading principles are given in this chapter. An 
inexperienced superintendent can do no better than to 
discuss these problems and principles with experienced 
and successful superintendents in other schools. 
Length of periods and recitations in grades—In the 
primary and lower grades pupils should have shorter 
recitation and study periods, and more frequent inter- 
mission periods for rest and recreation, as well as shorter 
school days. Children in the first and second grades 
should not be confined in the school longer than from 
four to four and one-half hours. Those who cannot well 
be sent home earlier in the forenoon and afternoon should 
be allowed as much freedom in the building and on the 
playground as conditions and facilities will permit. In 
the first three or four grades there should be several rest 
and recreation periods each day. Some of these periods 
need be only a few minutes in length and may be used 
for both mental and physical development. There 
104
-P-A-G-E-121
PROBLEMS AND PRINCIPLES 105 
should, however, be one longer outside recreation period 
each half day for the first six grades at least, and where 
there is no gymnasium work it is well to include in this 
also the seventh and eighth grades. In order to produce 
the best results socially and physically the activities 
during this period should be directed and supervised. 
Most children need to be taught how to play, and it is 
here where a good teacher has a wonderful opportunity 
to direct the social development of a child. 
Length and number of periods in high schools—In the 
average high school in smaller places a program of four 
periods of forty-five minutes in the forenoon and in the 
afternoon is quite common. In this way pupils carrying 
four regular subjects will have one study period for each 
recitation period, and double periods for laboratory and 
industrial work can readily be arranged and correlated 
with two single periods, in both the forenoon and after- 
noon. Such a program provides for the greatest number 
of periods a day which also makes possible the greatest 
number of classes per teacher in small schools. It is 
therefore the most economical from an immediate finan- 
cial viewpoint. On the other hand, it does not ordinarily 
provide for supervised study in connection with the 
classroom work, and it means that there are larger groups 
in the assembly room during the different periods of the 
day, which is more likely to make discipline there a 
problem. 
Pupils generally are required to earn four academic 
credits per semester. In many schools they are expected 
to do some additional work during the year in athletics, 
music, literary work, art, or debating. This is generally 
decided by the superintendent and principal, but where
-P-A-G-E-122
106 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
it is required and where credit is given for this work the 
program should be such that a period can be set aside 
for this purpose during regular school hours. 
In the Anita High School there are six fifty-five-minute 
periods and one thirty-minute period each day. The first 
part of the fifty-five-minute periods is devoted to recita- 
tion work and the second part to supervised or directed 
study work. Laboratory periods are eighty minutes in 
length, three regular periods being divided into two 
laboratory periods. The last thirty-minute period is 
devoted to making up back work or time that may have 
been lost through tardiness or absence. Music, gym- 
nasium, and literary-program work is offered during the 
last period. To avoid conflicts a regular schedule is 
worked out for making up back work or lost time. On 
Monday for example, the English teacher (or the subject 
of English) has preference. This means that if a pupil has 
work to make up in different subjects, the teacher of his 
English work will be entitled to his time on Monday. 
Likewise: 
On Tuesday, Mathematics has preference. 
On Wednesday, History, Political and Social Science. 
On Thursday, Physics, General and Domestic Science. 
On Friday, French, Commercial Geography, and 
Biology. 
See Anita High School Program on page 102 of preced- 
ing chapter. 
Combinations and alternations in grades—Where 
there are not enough pupils in each year to make full-size 
classes, and especially where the teaching force and build- 
ing facilities are inadequate, economy usually demands 
that two or more grades be conducted in one room and
-P-A-G-E-123
  PROBLEMS AND PRINCIPLES 107 
by one teacher. If by such an arrangement there are too 
many recitations per day for one teacher the number 
can be reduced by combining in certain subjects pupils 
from two consecutive years and offering these subjects 
biennially. In this way larger-size classes can be had and 
the burden of the teacher can be lightened. By such a 
combination the problem of an extra teacher or a room- 
ing problem can often be solved. In the first and second 
year, however, these combinations should not be made. 
To quote from the state course of study for Missouri: 
“No alternation is possible in the first and second year. 
In the third and fourth years all of the work may be 
alternated with the exception of arithmetic. In the fifth 
and sixth years all subjects may be alternated. It is 
frequently found not advisable to alternate the arith- 
metic, since these years involve a study of fractions and 
teachers find some difficulty in teaching sixth-year 
work to pupils who have not had the fifth year. In 
1921-22 the fifth- and sixth-year classes should study the 
work of the fifth year, and in 1922-23 the work of the 
sixth year. The work of these two years has been so 
arranged as to be practically independent of each other, 
and the fifth year is as difficult as the sixth year. In the 
seventh and eighth years there should be no trouble 
whatever in making alternations in all subjects.” 
Similar combinations of grades are now advocated in 
a number of different state courses of study. In the 
introduction of the South Dakota Course of Study for 
Elementary Schools we read: “The one feature of this 
course of study which distinguishes it from its predecessor 
is its plan of alternation. By this plan many of the 
pupils in the different grades are united in class work
-P-A-G-E-124
  108 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
with the pupils of the next higher or lower grade and the 
work of the higher or lower grade is omitted for the year. 
The next year the work omitted the year before is done 
and the work which was offered the previous year is 
omitted.” 
Combinations and alternations in small high schools 
—A beginning superintendent in a small school system 
should not make the mistake of copying too much after 
the larger high schools without regard to cost of instruc- 
tion. Economy generally demands an organization that 
will provide for reasonable-size classes throughout, and 
often it is necessary in small high schools to group pupils 
from two consecutive years in various subjects if fair- 
size classes are to be maintained. The work can gen- 
erally be so arranged that various combinations may be 
made, excepting in certain subjects. There is no good 
reason why small groups in two consecutive years cannot 
be combined in such subjects as general science, citizen- 
ship, physiology, and bookkeeping, to be taught in either 
the ninth or tenth year; or why such subjects as 
economics, agriculture, and civics cannot be taught in 
either the eleventh or twelfth year. 
Where the enrolment in the high school is small, high 
school work should not be emphasized to the detriment 
of the grade work. Unless the number of pupils is 
sufficiently large to maintain fair-size classes by com- 
bining grades for work that can be so arranged, it is more 
economical and often better for all concerned to offer 
only one or two years of high school work and have that 
maintained at a high standard. In planning a course for 
a one- or two-year high school the program should be such 
that it will admit pupils without condition or serious loss 
 
-P-A-G-E-125
  PROBLEMS AND PRINCIPLES 109 
of time into some larger four-year high school. No 
studies should be offered for which the school cannot 
make. adequate provisions in teachers and equipment. 
See course of study for small high schools, pp. 85 and 100 
of preceding chapter. 
Two-, three-, or four-room buildings—In a two-, three-, 
or four-room building the program must necessarily be 
quite different than that of a system in which each 
teacher has one grade in her own room. In such schools 
there are as a rule no special teachers and the regular 
teachers must either teach such subjects as music, draw- 
ing, penmanship, household arts, manual training, and 
agriculture, or these subjects must be divided among the 
teachers. In such subjects as manual training and house- 
hold arts the periods should be longer. This makes it 
more difficult to alternate these subjects with other sub- 
jects. This is true especially where they are divided 
among the teachers and taught by one teacher in differ- 
ent grades or rooms. Other things being equal, better 
work can be done on the part of the teacher if the work 
is divided or departmentalized, but in small schools with 
small classes the matter is simplified and fewer teachers 
will be required where each teacher can take care of the 
various subjects in her own room. Furthermore, there 
is no good reason why the average teacher in these 
schools cannot learn to teach such subjects as drawing 
and penmanship as well as history and physiology. The 
same may be said of the fundamentals of music, house- 
hold arts, and agriculture. To quote Wagner, “Where 
there is one teacher to a room and grade there is no good 
reason why she cannot within a year or two learn from 
a supervisor to teach writing and drawing and possibly
-P-A-G-E-126
  110 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
music. To allow one teacher to contend that she cannot 
teach writing, another drawing, and another music does 
not justify employment of special teachers permanently.” 
It may be said, furthermore, that those who have had 
the most training in music are not necessarily the best 
music teachers for a given grade. The most skilful 
penmen are by no means always the best penmanship 
teachers, nor are the best trained and most skilful artists 
always the best drawing or painting teachers. This is 
not saying that we should not strive for as much perfec- 
tion as possible on the part of teachers for these subjects. 
Other things being equal the best prepared individuals 
are the best teachers, but other things seldom are equal. 
We should not fail, therefore, to consider relative cost 
or to make allowance for native ability and teaching skill 
as well as for special training. 
The following is quoted from a pamphlet, The Making 
of School Programs, issued by the Department of Public 
Instruction of the State of New Jersey: “The three or 
four teachers in three- or four-room buildings should be 
able and willing to divide among themselves the so-called 
special subjects—music, drawing, household, mechanical, 
and agricultural activities. These subjects may be made 
more vital by the regular teacher than they can be made 
by a special teacher who visits the room at weekly or 
monthly periods. The special teacher may be a guide, 
an inspiration, a helper, and should be employed for such 
purposes wherever possible, but in many three- or four- 
room buildings this is not possible. The absence of the 
special teacher is not a valid reason for neglecting these 
subjects.” 
Crowded building facilities—In some schools it is
-P-A-G-E-127
PROBLEMS AND PRINCIPLES 11 
necessary, because of crowded building facilities and ar- 
rangement, to have one or both of the seventh and eighth 
grades in the high school room. It may then be expedient 
to have the periods for these grades the same length as 
those in the high school, or to have the recitation and 
study period of the grammar grades equal in length to 
one of the high school periods. If the classes in the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth years are small, it may be 
advisable to give such subjects as manual training and 
domestic science to the ninth-year pupils together with 
those of the seventh and eighth grades. 
The best solution for relieving a crowded condition in 
both the grades and the high school is the organization 
and establishment of a separate intermediate school or 
junior high school for the seventh, eighth, and ninth 
grades. Many of the intermediate or junior high school 
buildings throughout the country have been provided 
primarily for this purpose. In the cities this type of 
school is now rapidly growing in favor.

  CHAPTER VIII 
BOOKS AND SUPPLIES 
Selecting and handling books and supplies—Wide 
variation exists with respect to the methods of selecting, 
ordering, and handling text books and supplies. In some 
places the board considers and passes upon the books to 
be used and the supplies and apparatus to be purchased. 
In smaller communities, however, the matter is usually 
left largely to the superintendent. In some places books 
and supplies are handled through the local dealers while 
in other places they are handled directly by the school 
through the superintendent’s office. In some school 
systems such material as writing and drawing paper, 
pencils, ink, etc., are purchased by the board and paid for 
out of the general fund; in other systems pupils are re- 
quired to purchase this material themselves. In case of 
state or county adoptions of text books the matter of 
selection is, of course, decided. 
Care in ordering books—Local dealers commonly 
charge from 10 to 25 per cent of the cost price for 
handling text books. Often a part of this charge is 
necessitated by the wasteful methods of ordering and 
handling books. If care is exercised in checking on the 
number of books needed and if the books on hand are 
disposed of in exchange whenever new books are adopted, 
dealers can handle books on a smaller per cent and with 
112
-P-A-G-E-129
BOOKS AND SUPPLIES 113 
more profit. The writer knows of more than one place 
where dealers are obliged to charge an unreasonable per 
cent for handling school books and supplies, chiefly be- 
cause the superintendent has no regard for economy or 
promptness in giving orders. Books are ordered that are 
not used during the year and new books are adopted and 
ordered without having the shelves cleared of the old 
stock. In this way the dealers are obliged to carry a large 
share of the stock over from year to year, and finally lose 
the price of many books that have become useless. 
Often, too, orders are not given until just before or after 
schools open. This is during the rush season when ship- 
ments are frequently delayed, and this fact causes dealers 
more or less annoyance and subjects them to criticism on 
the part of their patrons. Sometimes the chief fault lies 
with the secretary or clerk of the board. 
All this waste and unnecessary trouble, in the long 
run, is paid for out of the price of the books. Where such 
methods are tolerated the pupils pay too much for their 
text books; the dealers are annoyed and subjected to 
losses; and the superintendent usually loses his standing 
with the dealers, and sometimes with the community. 
Too often this waste is due to the fact that responsibili- 
ties are divided and diffused. No one is held directly 
responsible for the price of Johnnie’s books. The superin- 
tendent should know what books and supplies will be 
required and should see to it that these are made acces- 
sible to pupils and teachers in due time and by economi- 
cal methods. 
Making changes in the purchasing and handling of 
books and supplies—A superintendent should at all 
times seek to bring about needed improvements, but a
-P-A-G-E-130
  114 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
new man should familiarize himself with the methods 
previously followed in the community before acting on 
his own initiative. He should be careful about advocating 
making changes in the purchasing and handling of books 
and supplies until he has made a study of the matter and 
knows what is involved. The methods prevailing in the 
community may not be the most practical or efficient, 
but not infrequently they are partly the result of a com- 
promise or political influence, and any attempt to change 
matters or to divert business from one channel to another 
is met with a storm of reaction. It is often better, there- 
fore, for a new superintendent not to concern himself too 
much about immediate changes, but to wait until he has 
been in the community long enough to know what the 
conditions and problems are. Generally it is best to 
bring about changes through a gradual enlightenment of 
the best methods. 
Changing text books—Text books should be changed 
from time to time in order to be kept up to date, but too 
many changes should not be made at one time, and no 
change should be made without a careful consideration 
of the merits of both the old and the new book. The selec- 
tion of suitable text and reference books is of first im- 
portance, and a good superintendent will familiarize 
himself with the books put out by different publishing 
houses. He will strive to know as far as possible what 
is best and where to get it. He will treat all representa- 
tives of book companies and supply houses respectfully 
and courteously for he will realize that through them he 
can best learn of new and better material. He will not, 
however, allow book men to send him a copy of every 
book for review or for his library. Nor will he allow them
-P-A-G-E-131
BOOKS AND SUPPLIES 115 
to induce him to change a text book until he has made 
a thorough comparison of the new book and the one that 
is being used, and has satisfied himself that the change 
is justifiable. Likewise he will not allow the different 
teachers to tell him what is best or what is needed with- 
out duly investigating the matter for himself. In 
changing text books the number of books on hand by 
pupils and dealers should also be taken into considera- 
tion. A new book should not only be better but should 
be enough better to justify the cost of changing. When 
a text book is changed arrangements should always be 
made to have all unused books disposed of in exchange. 
Books, materials, and equipment needed—Primary 
teachers should be supplied with reading charts and with 
material for hand work and seat work, such as, rules, 
scissors, blocks, and material for paper cutting, drawing, 
coloring, and weaving. There should also be a sand table 
and kindergarten chairs in the room. There should be 
three or four sets of supplementary readers for each of 
the primary grades and two or three sets for each of the 
intermediate and grammar grades. Some of these read- 
ers should be purchased by the board and kept in the 
rooms as property of the district. In case of larger school 
systems the books for a given grade may be exchanged. 
In each set there should be a book for every pupil in the 
class. There should be one or more globes in each grade 
building and an adequate supply of maps and charts; 
such illustrative material as blocks and units of weights 
and measures; dry and liquid measures; dictionaries; and 
other necessary equipment. In the high school there 
should be an adequate supply of general reference books, 
maps, charts, etc., required for the various subjects

classes in science and vocational subjects. 
Paper racks, shelves, and cases should be provided for 
storing equipment and supplies when not in use. Teach- 
ers and pupils should be made to feel individual responsi- 
bility for the care and upkeep of all equipment, and a 
careful inventory should be taken once a year of the 
books, supplies, and equipment in each room. 
In purchasing books, equipment, and supplies care 
should be exercised to provide first that which is most 
important and most useful. A variety and assortment 
of inexpensive apparatus and equipment which can be 
used by many pupils and in different classes and grades 
is generally preferable to fewer, more expensive pieces 
which can be used only by a single class. The same is 
true with dictionaries and various reference books. Sev- 
eral medium-size dictionaries are better than one large 
one. There should be an unabridged dictionary, however, 
in each of the upper-grade rooms, and one or more in the 
high school. Maps and charts should, as far as possible, 
be such that they can be easily moved and used in differ- 
ent rooms. Likewise equipment for vocational and 
science subjects should be purchased with a view to serve 
as many pupils as possible. Where all pupils cannot 
have permanent access to books, supplies, and equipment, 
an arrangement should be worked out whereby different 
classes can use this material at different times. With 
careful purchasing and planning of the use of material 
one hundred dollars will go further than several hundred 
dollars would go without careful planning. A good 
superintendent will see that the available funds are so 
utilized as first to provide the most needed and most
-P-A-G-E-133
  BOOKS AND SUPPLIES 117 
useful equipment. He will exercise general oversight of 
all equipment. 
School libraries—Every school system should have a 
well-selected, workable library of supplementary and 
reference books, in both the elementary school and the 
high school. The most desirable arrangement is to have 
a separate room equipped for this purpose, accessible to 
pupils every day and during school hours. In many 
schools, however, this cannot be had, especially in smaller 
communities. Where a separate room is not available it 
is usually possible to find some suitable space which can 
be equipped and utilized for a library. It may be in the 
principal’s office, or the end of a corridor which can be 
spared for this purpose. In the high school the library 
is frequently in the rear or front of the assembly room. 
In smaller schools a few stacks and shelves for books, a 
magazine rack, a single library table, and chairs will serve 
the purpose of making library books and magazines 
accessible to pupils. Where there is a public library the 
schools should seek to codperate with it to the fullest 
extent. In this way the facilities and benefits of a school 
library can be greatly extended. 
How to select and purchase books for a library—The 
selection of books for a school library is a very important 
matter and should not be done hastily. Those who are 
inexperienced in the matter should supply themselves 
with reliable guidance or secure the aid of some one who 
has had experience in selecting and purchasing books for 
school libraries. It is a good rule to buy books only 
through the regular trade channels and upon the recom- 
mendation of established authority. Various State De- 
partments of Public Instruction, State Libraries, and
-P-A-G-E-134
  118 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
Universities have prepared excellent lists of books for 
school libraries. The State Departments of Public In- 
struction of Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin have pre- 
pared such lists, which may be purchased from these 
departments for fifty cents each. The United States 
Bureau of Education issues a bulletin (Bulletin 1917, 
No. 41) on library books for high schools. State reading 
circle boards also recommend lists of books for school 
libraries. These lists can usually be secured from county 
superintendents. 
When a list of books has been selected, it is well to 
submit it to different dealers for prices. It is usually 
possible to purchase books cheaper by allowing one dealer 
to order the whole list than by purchasing a few books 
directly from each of the publishers. A copy of the order 
should be filed and when the books arrive they should 
be checked with the order to see that all have been re- 
ceived and that they are as ordered. A mark of owner- 
ship should be stamped in every book and no book should 
be taken from the library without a record of the fact, 
or in accordance with some regular system. 
Every book added to the library should be entered in 
an accession book, which should show on a single line 
the accession number, name of author, title, publisher, 
and price of every book. The accession book becomes 
the official record of all books received and should be 
carefully preserved. In small libraries it may take the 
place of a catalog. 
In classifying and arranging books in a library all 
books on a given subject should be grouped together. 
Fiction should be arranged alphabetically by the author’s 
surname. Individual biographies should be arranged
-P-A-G-E-135
| 
BOOKS AND SUPPLIES 119 
alphabetically according to the name of the person whose 
life is told. Each book should be labeled and numbered 
on the back, and arranged on the shelf according to its 
number. 
If the library is sufficiently extensive to warrant it, a 
standard system of classification should be use. The 
Dewey Decimal System is the most widely used through- 
out this country. It divides all books into ten main 
classes. These in turn are sub-divided into ten divisions, 
and so on into sections. 
Further information concerning the classification, 
cataloging, and arrangement of books in libraries may be 
obtained from the Library Commission of your state, or 
from Fay and Eaton, Boston Book Co., or Gaylord 
Brothers, Syracuse, New York. 
For concerns dealing in library supplies see classified 
list of manufacturers, dealers, and publishers. Write for 
catalogs. 
Where there is no regular librarian, the principal may 
be made responsible for the care of the library. Other 
teachers may be required to take care of certain sections 
of books or of the books on their respective subjects. All 
teachers should be required to familiarize themselves 
with the books available in their special field or line of 
work, in order to be able to direct and interest pupils in 
the use of these books. 
Traveling library—State library commissions now 
provide for the free use of many books by supplying 
traveling libraries to schools and communities throughout 
the state. This enables school officers and teachers to 
borrow collections of twenty-five to fifty books, or more, 
for periods of three to six months each. These libraries
-P-A-G-E-136
    
120 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
include children’s fairy tales and story books; history, 
geography, and science books for grade pupils; fiction, 
travel, biography, literature. The books are shipped to 
any community or school district upon request of the 
proper persons and the only expense to the community 
or school is the payment of the transportation charges. 
Teachers and school officials should familiarize them- 
selves with the advantages afforded by these traveling 
libraries and should make use of them. Where sufficient 
funds are not available for an adequate library this is an 
excellent means for extending the facilities. 
The superintendent’s office—The office of the superin- 
tendent of even a small school system should be equipped 
with necessary bookcases, shelves, cabinets, and files, so 
that he can systematize and arrange things in such a way 
as to utilize his time most economically and effectively. 
Where sufficient funds are available it is an easy matter 
to obtain suitable equipment, but in many smaller com- 
munities very little money is allowed for this purpose. 
If expensive cabinets and closed cases cannot be had, 
much can be done with home-made shelving and inex- 
pensive pockets or pamphlet boxes for filing bulletins, 
pamphlets, catalogs, and reports. These can be pur- 
chased from firms that specialize in library supplies at 
from ten to fifteen cents each. They can be labeled on 
the back as to their contents and can be placed on book- 
shelves so as to make a neat and convenient arrangement. 
Besides files for material pertaining to different subjects 
there should be separate files for the following: 
1. Athletics 
2. Board Meetings 
3. Declamatory Work
-P-A-G-E-137
  BOOKS AND SUPPLIES 121 
4, Debating 
5. Examinations 
6. Graduation 
7. Lantern Slides or Films 
8. Lectures or Literary Work 
9. Music 
10. Parent-Teacher Association 
11. Records 
12. School Paper 
13. Teachers’ Meetings 
14. Teachers’ Credentials 
15. Tests and Measurements 
Letter files can also be used to good advantage for ma- 
terial that is not too bulky, by placing in the front of the 
file a table of contents with letters corresponding to vari- 
ous letters of the file index. This makes a convenient ar- 
rangement for such material as daily programs, schedules, 
directions to teachers, inspectors’ reports, rules and regu- 
lations, and clippings. The important thing is to have 
everything classified and arranged in such a way that it 
can be found instantly. 
The permanent records of the school should be kept 
in a well-protected place under lock and key. 
Free text books—Where free text books are in use it 
is necessary to have definite rules concerning their use 
and care. The following summary may serve as a guide. 
1. All books should be ordered by teachers and prin- 
cipals on requisition blanks provided for that purpose. 
All books sent to teachers or principal should be requisi- 
tioned on these blanks. The blanks should always be 
properly filled in and signed, and filed as receipts. 
 
-P-A-G-E-138
  122 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
2. Teachers should be held responsible for a satisfac- 
tory account of all books charged to them. 
8. Each child, on enrolling, should be provided with 
the required books that he does not already have. 
4. Children should be required to exercise reasonable 
care in the use of all books loaned them. Marking and 
otherwise defacing books should not be tolerated. All 
children should understand that free text books are 
school property and should receive the same care exacted 
in the use of other public property. 
5. When a book is loaned the teacher should note its 
condition and write in the book, in ink, under the caption, 
“Condition When Loaned” a letter or mark designating 
the condition of the book. A corresponding notation 
should then be made in the teacher’s text-book record 
or on a book-record card. When a book is loaned the 
child’s name should be written, in ink, on the first line 
provided for that purpose. In case of a high school text 
provided with a “Book-Record Card” the pupil’s name 
should be written, in ink, in the front of the book and 
on the card. The card should then be properly filed. 
6. When a book is returned the teacher should note its 
condition and make allowance for reasonable wear. In 
case of loss, defacement, or unreasonable wear a fine 
should be collected. This should also be recorded in the 
book record or on the record card and in the report of 
receipts. 
7. In some places high school pupils are not given 
credit for their work and grade pupils are not promoted 
until all books are returned and all fines paid. 
Disinfecting and destroying books—During vacation 
time all used books should be thoroughly disinfected. 
 
-P-A-G-E-139
  BOOKS AND SUPPLIES 123 
Books used by pupils from homes in which there has been 
any contagious disease should be destroyed. Likewise 
books that are badly soiled and torn should not be as- 
signed to pupils or kept in circulation, but should be 
destroyed. Pupils do not like to use old and worn-out, 
books, especially when they have been worn out by 
others; and an important factor in teaching pupils to 
take care of books is to assign to no one a book that is 
not in good condition and to allow no one to continue 
using a book that is not in fair condition. 
Making a list of all text books used—A typewritten 
list should be made of all text books used, together with 
the names and addresses of the respective publishing 
houses. In this list the books used in each grade, includ- 
ing the high school, may be grouped or listed separately, 
or the high school books may be listed by departments. 
This will enable a superintendent to find instantly the 
name and publisher of any book in any grade that he 
may wish to order or to which he may wish to refer. 
The following shows the books used in the sixth grade 
and in the mathematics department of the high school 
of Anita, Iowa. A similar list including the books and 
publishers for all grades and high school departments 
will be found very convenient by busy superintendents.

  CHAPTER IX 
RULES AND REGULATIONS 
Shall we have rules and regulations?—Educators 
differ with respect to the rules and regulations that 
should be set up or expressed and the extent to which 
they should be detailed. Some hold that the fewer the 
printed or expressed rules the better, while others regret 
that so many smaller school systems have no record of 
adopted and established rules and regulations. 
Rules are necessary for the proper maintenance of any 
school system. They may be written or unwritten, ex- 
pressed or implied, and may be followed or applied more 
or less consciously or unconsciously. Too many detailed 
regulations are impractical; but to have no written or 
expressed regulations for guidance, or to have the fewest 
possible of such regulations, seems equally unwise. A 
school administrator should strive to formulate a system 
of necessary rules and regulations and should do what he 
can to see that they become institutionalized in the sys- 
tem. In this way stability and permanency can be given 
to a school, which will be a strong factor in helping teach- 
ers to maintain a good program with respect to both con- 
duct and effort, and will be especially helpful to school 
administrators and teachers who are new in the system 
or community.

  RULES AND REGULATIONS 135 
Teachers and pupils need and desire definite informa- 
tion—It should not be assumed that with a good corps 
of teachers and a good school spirit such matters as con- 
duct and discipline, outside duties and obligations will 
take care of themselves. The writer has found repeatedly, 
through years of experience, that well-meaning pupils, 
and good teachers need, and generally desire, definite 
information with respect to their various duties and 
privileges, both in and out of the school room. It is 
much better to have all requirements clearly understood 
by all from the beginning than to regulate matters by 
making rules to prevent the recurrence of infractions and 
misdemeanors after they have been committed. 
Many well-meaning boys and girls have gotten into 
mischief or have been misled through misunderstandings 
concerning matters for which directions or preventive 
regulations should have been established; and many a 
faithful and upright teacher has failed because she did 
not know just what was required of her, or did not realize 
the importance of her duties or actions with respect 
to certain matters that should have been definitely 
expressed. 
All rules should be made and worded with great care. 
They should be simple, clear, direct, fair, and just. Good 
common sense, understanding of human nature, and a 
knowledge of the problems involved, are necessary pre- 
requisites to the making and enforcing of rules. 
Each teacher should be supplied with a printed or, 
typewritten copy of the rules, with which she should be 
required to familiarize herself. It is well also to have 
teachers remind their pupils from time to time of such 
rules and regulations as are likely to be disregarded or 
 
-P-A-G-E-152
  136 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
violated. When this is done pupils should be informed 
in an understandable manner as to why such rules are 
necessary, final aims or purposes, etc. 
If there is a printed booklet or bulletin containing the 
rules and regulations of the schools it is well also to sup- 
ply parents with a copy. This will aid in bringing about 
a common understanding as to what is required of the 
children. 
Specific advantages—The following arguments may 
be advanced in favor of a carefully worked-out set of 
rules and regulations: 
1. It will enable pupils and teachers to know just what 
is required of them. 
2. It will guard against misunderstandings. 
8. It will enable teachers to hold pupils responsible for 
any requirements covered by the rules, and will enable 
a superintendent likewise to hold teachers responsible. 
4. It will act as a preventive against matters of mis- 
conduct covered by the rules, and will prevent certain 
pupils from excusing themselves by pretending they did 
not know they were doing wrong. 
5. It will enable school officers and patrons to know 
what is being done and what is required. 
6. It will promote harmony, uniformity, and 
codperation. 
7. It will make for better order and a better school. 
The following lists of rules and regulations for teachers 
and pupils are given as suggestive, and may be used as 
a guide by administrators who are new in the field. 
Some of these rules have been culled from the programs 
of various school systems, and have been selected by the 
writer because of their common adoption and their rela-
-P-A-G-E-153
  RULES AND REGULATIONS 137 
tive importance as shown by experience. They contain 
many helps and hints worthy of careful consideration. 
Rules and Regulations for Teachers 
1. Observing and enforcing rules—It shall be the 
duty of every teacher to familiarize herself with the rules 
and regulations of the school and to do what she can at 
all times to see that these rules and regulations are 
enforced. 
2. Fidelity and joint responsibility—Teachers shall 
devote themselves faithfully to their school duties and 
strive to codperate with other teachers to enforce the 
rules of order in and about the school building and on 
the school grounds. Every member of the teaching staff 
should consider herself jointly responsible for a good 
school. 
3. Spirit—Teachers should at all times be enthusiastic 
and optimistic. They should themselves exhibit proper 
animation, manifesting a lively interest in their work. 
Heavy plodding movements, formal routine in teaching, 
and all signs of weariness and indifference should be care- 
fully avoided, lest the work become monotonous and 
pupils become indifferent or imbibe the notion that they 
study only to recite or to pass examinations. 
4. Criticism and discord—Teachers are required to be 
courteous with one another, to refrain from unkind 
criticism of other teachers, to avoid the circulation of 
remarks calculated to injure or belittle a fellow teacher, 
or to sow seeds of discord among themselves or others. 
5. Remaining in rooms—Teachers are required to be 
in their respective rooms thirty minutes in the morning 
and fifteen minutes in the afternoon before the opening
-P-A-G-E-154
  138 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
of the regular session. The teacher should always be in 
her room when pupils begin to enter and should remain 
in her room at all times during the session of school. 
Excepting in bad weather she should be out in the open 
air with her pupils during recesses, and not visit in the 
rooms of other teachers during this time. Under ordi- 
nary circumstances teachers should remain in their rooms 
until 4:10 and encourage retarded pupils to stay for help 
after school. Hall and playground teachers should be 
on duty according to schedule. 
6. Dismissal of pupils—No teacher shall dismiss her 
pupils before the regular time, or leave the building 
during school hours without permission of the superin- 
tendent or principal, excepting in cases of sickness or 
accidents that will not permit of delay. 
7. Register and records—Teachers are required to 
keep all records neatly and accurately, and in accordance 
with rules and forms prescribed. Names should not be 
entered in the class register until the second or third 
week of school, since there are usually changes during 
the first and second week. 
8. The daily program—Within two weeks after the 
beginning of the school year all grade teachers are re- 
quired to present to the superintendent or principal a 
detailed copy of their daily program. (The superintend- 
ent or principal will help teachers in working out this 
program.) A copy of the daily program shall be dis- 
played in each room at all times and shall not be changed 
without the consent of the superintendent or the principal. 
9. Halls and stairs—Teachers are expected to be in the 
halls outside their classroom doors and maintain order 
while pupils are passing to and from different rooms.
-P-A-G-E-155
RULES AND REGULATIONS 139 
When pupils in the lower grades are dismissed for recess, 
teachers should be with them as they go through halls 
or down stairs. 
10. The special teacher—Special teachers are subject 
to all general rules and regulations the same as regular 
teachers, and in matters of discipline are jointly respon- 
sible for good order and conduct in and about the school 
building, as well as in the rooms in which they are 
teaching. 
11. Remaining in rooms with special teacher—Regu- 
lar teachers in charge of a room are expected to remain 
in their room during recitations conducted by special 
teachers or supervisors in order to observe methods and 
otherwise aid the special teacher as much as possible. 
If the number of pupils in the room is small and 
the special teacher has no problems of discipline to con- 
tend with, the regular teacher may, with the approval 
of the principal or superintendent, leave the room during 
a part of this period, but ordinarily she should be there 
during part of each recitation to observe methods and 
directions. She should at all times codperate with the 
special teacher or supervisor as far as possible to carry 
out plans and directions. 
12. Requiring excuses—Teachers shall require ex- 
cuses, in person or by written note, from parents or 
guardians of pupils who have been absent or tardy. 
When a pupil fails to bring a satisfactory excuse, the 
teacher or principal shall notify his parents or guardian. 
Doubtful or poor excuses should be sent to the principal 
or superintendent’s office as soon as possible. The pupil 
may be sent to the superintendent with the excuse. High 
school pupils who have been absent or tardy should not
-P-A-G-E-156
  140 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
be admitted to class without an excuse from parents or 
guardians. This excuse should be taken to the principal 
and receive her mark of approval. 
13. Sending pupils from room—If it becomes neces- 
sary to send a pupil from the room, send him directly 
to the principal or superintendent. Always send a note 
by the offender stating definitely why he is sent. Never 
simply send a pupil from class. The special forms or 
blanks provided for this purpose should be used when- 
ever possible. When these are not available the note 
should contain (1) the name of the pupil, (2) the exact 
time of day he is sent, (3) why he is sent and any sug- 
gestions or recommendations by the teacher, and (4) the 
teacher’s name. The above information shall be pre- 
served and placed on file in the superintendent's office. 
14. Cleanliness—Cleanliness and tidiness shall be re- 
quired of all pupils. Pupils who are careless in this 
matter may, with the consent of the superintendent, be 
sent home for proper care, in which case the parents or 
guardian should always be notified either in person or by 
note. 
15. Sending pupils on errands—Pupils should not be 
sent on errands by teachers during school hours, except- 
ing on urgent school business. 
16. Care of rooms—Teachers should carefully attend 
to the ventilation and temperature of their rooms, ad- 
justing of window shades, order of desks, books on 
shelves, etc. If the building has no special means of 
ventilation the rooms should be aired at each intermis- 
sion. Window shades should always be well raised 
excepting in cases of direct sunlight or strong light in
-P-A-G-E-157
  RULES AND REGULATIONS 141 
the front of the room which the children would be obliged 
to face. 
17. Care of equipment, apparatus, and books—Teach- 
ers are required to exercise reasonable supervision over 
the furniture, equipment and apparatus of their rooms, 
and over the text books of their pupils. Text books 
should be inspected from time to time to prevent deface- 
ment or destruction, and damage done to furniture, 
equipment, etc., should be reported to the principal or 
superintendent the same day, or as soon as possible. 
18. Aiding the janitor—Teachers are required to aid 
the janitor in so far as it is in their power, by keeping 
their rooms neat and clean and by enforcing all orders 
concerning the use of waste paper, pencil shavings, ete. 
Pupils should not be allowed to tear sheets of paper into 
bits and drop these on the floor or allow them to remain 
where they are likely to be scattered. A good rule is to 
require that every pupil keep all bits of paper and other 
scatterings picked up around his seat. In the assembly 
room and recitation rooms of the high school each teacher 
should see to it that pupils during her assembly-room 
period or recitation period do not leave the floor, desk, 
or blackboard in an untidy condition for the next teacher. 
19. Requistions for supplies and books—All requisi- 
tions for supplies and books needed by the principal, 
supervisors, or teachers shall be inspected and counter- 
signed by the superintendent. 
20. Discipline—Teachers are required to be discreet 
and judicious in all matters of discipline, avoiding haste 
and prejudice, but firmly insisting on good order. Special 
attention should be given to the habits, morals, and man- 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  142 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
ners of pupils. Every teacher should learn how to control 
and discipline her room. Whenever she is obliged to call 
on outside help she confesses her inability to manage her 
pupils. Some pupils will keenly realize this and will 
resort to further violations in order to punish the teacher. 
Teachers should know or learn how to reason with young 
people. They should know or learn to realize that the 
best disciplinarians are those who govern themselves 
well, and secure good order by gentle influence. 
21. Punishment—Some form of punishment is, and 
probably always will be, necessary, and no phase of the 
teacher’s work demands more careful deliberation, tact, 
and good judgment than the infliction of punishment. 
Corporal punishment should always be avoided except in 
extreme cases. It is advocated less and less by thought- 
ful and experienced teachers, and it is quite safe to say 
that the teacher who administers corporal punishment 
most frequently is the poorest and weakest disciplinarian. 
All cases requiring severe punishment, or cases that are 
doubtful should be referred to the superintendent for his 
decision. 
The use of ridicule, sarcasm, and irony, is also wrong. 
It indicates a wrong spirit on the part of the teacher and 
is likely to develop a wrong attitude on the part of the 
pupil. Likewise it is unjust, as well as cowardly, to re- 
duce a pupil’s grades in his regular academic work be- 
cause of his deportment. Scholarship marks are intended 
to be, and as far as possible should be, reliable records of 
a pupil’s knowledge of certain subject-matter. When 
these records are changed as a matter of punishment they 
cease to be such. 
Truancy should be punished by requiring the pupil to
-P-A-G-E-159
  RULES AND REGULATIONS 143 
make up all lost time and work. If this does not stop 
the offence, additional time and work should be required. 
22. Assembly-room charts—All high school teachers 
having charge of the assembly room are required to make 
a chart showing the names and places of pupils in each 
of their assembly-room periods and to check on attend- 
ance each period. 
23. Pupils leaving the room—Teachers should not 
allow pupils to leave the room too often or unnecessarily. 
Unless the teacher is careful and tactful in preventing 
this, some pupils will continually and habitually ask to 
leave the room simply to take a walk or wander about. 
Pupils who repeatedly leave the room more than a rea- 
sonable number of times a day, or more than a 
‘reasonable number of minutes a day should be required 
to make up all time lost, and more time if they continue 
to abuse the privilege. In case of sickness or ailments 
teachers should insist on a note from the parents. In the 
high school each pupil leaving the room may be required 
to fill out a slip or blank, showing his name, the time of 
leaving, and the time of returning. These slips may be 
put on a spindle or hook on the desk of the assembly- 
room teacher when the pupil returns, They may then 
be looked over by the principal or some other teacher in 
the evening. It may be necessary to require this only 
from time to time in order to prevent pupils from leaving 
the room too often or remaining away too long. 
24. Remaining for commencement exercises—High 
school teachers are expected to remain in the city until 
the commencement exercises are over. To leave before 
this time is likely to create doubt as to their loyalty to 
the school and their interest in the class.
-P-A-G-E-160
  144 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
25. Reporting absence from duty—Whenever sickness 
or other justifiable reasons prevent a teacher from re- 
maining at her work during the day, or when it seems 
doubtful that she can be on duty the following day, she 
should report the matter to the superintendent as soon 
as possible so that a substitute teacher may be employed. 
Whenever possible under such circumstances the regular 
teacher should make a complete outline of the work to 
be done by the substitute teacher. 
26. Teachers’ meetings—It shall be the duty of the 
teachers to attend all teachers’ meetings called by the 
superintendent and present such reports of their work as 
he may deem necessary. No excuse, other than one that 
would justify absence from a regular session of school, 
shall be accepted for absence from the teachers’ meeting. 
27. Reminding pupils of rules and regulations— 
Teachers shall from time to time remind pupils in their 
respective rooms of such rules and regulations as are 
likely to be forgotten, violated, or disregarded. They 
shall see to it that pupils are acquainted with all rules 
and regulations of the school. 
28. Example—Teachers should never forget that their 
daily life, their appearance, speech, pleasures, and com- 
panionship are under the closest scrutiny, and that if 
they wish to have their pupils profit by their example 
they should be careful as to what that example is. 
29. Keeping physically and mentally fit—Every 
teacher should keep herself in good physical and mental 
condition. To get good results with her classes she must 
be in condition to create a good school atmosphere. This 
she cannot do if she is under nervous tension, irritable, 
or depressed. She should not become a slave to details.
-P-A-G-E-161
  RULES AND REGULATIONS 145 
Many a teacher sticks to the school room so closely that 
she not only fails to get the necessary diversion and 
recreation, but allows her particular work to shut off her 
view and contact from all the rest of the world. Such 
teachers are in constant danger of losing their sense of 
relative values and proportions. Every teacher should 
have some outside interest or hobby, and be a student 
of live issues, 
Rules for Pupils 
1. Physical condition—Pupils should keep themselves 
in good physical condition by eating and sleeping regu- 
larly and by taking plenty of exercise. 
2. Neatness and cleanliness—All pupils should be 
neat and clean in person and clothing, bathing frequently, 
keeping their teeth and nails clean, and their clothing 
neat and clean. There is no excuse for an unclean body 
or dirty clothing. High school girls should dress mod- 
estly and not try to make themselves conspicuous by 
extreme styles or a display of face powder and rouge. 
3. Contagious diseases—Pupils affected with any con- 
tagious or infectious disease, or coming from a home 
where such a disease is known to exist, shall be excluded 
from school and shall not be permitted to reénter until 
they are able to bring a certificate from a physician, 
stating that it is safe to readmit them. 
4. General conduct—Pupils are expected at all times 
to be respectful to their teachers, punctual in attendance, 
industrious in school work, and obedient to rules and 
regulations. 
5. Obeying instructions—Pupils are required to obey 
instructions of all teachers in charge of their respective
-P-A-G-E-162
  146 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
rooms, and of teachers and janitor in charge of corridors, 
basement, and playground. 
6. Books and supplies—Pupils are required to provide 
themselves with all books and supplies necessary for the 
grade to which they are assigned, unless these are fur- 
nished by the school. 
7. Regular attendance and home study—Regular at- 
tendance and some home study are essential to successful 
school work. The amount of home study will depend to 
a large extent upon the individual pupil. Nothing should 
be permitted to interfere with the home study necessary 
for satisfactory progress in school. 
8. Absence and tardiness—Sickness of pupil, or in 
family, or other unavoidable causes making attendance 
impossible or extremely inconvient, shall be regarded 
as the only legitimate causes for absence or tardiness. 
Repeated absence or tardiness shall not be tolerated 
excepting for reasons accepted by the teacher and 
superintendent. 
9. Written excuses—In case of absence or tardiness, 
or dismissal before the close of school, pupils are required 
to bring excuses written by parents or guardians. The 
excuse should state definitely when and why the pupil 
was obliged to be absent, and should be signed by the 
parent or guardian. Excuses should be presented at the 
first session after the absence. A personal excuse by 
parent or guardian will take the place of a written excuse 
and is generally preferable. 
10. Congregating on playgrounds in morning—Pupils 
are not allowed to congregate on the school grounds or 
in front of the outside doors before the ringing of the first 
bell in the morning.
-P-A-G-E-163
RULES AND REGULATIONS 147 
11. Removing rubbers and cleaning shoes—In rainy 
weather pupils are required to remove their rubbers or 
to clean their shoes carefully before entering the building. 
12. Throwing snowballs and missiles—Pupils are for- 
bidden to throw snowballs, stones, and other missiles on 
or in the vicinity of the school grounds. 
13. Use of tobacco, profane and obscene language— 
The use of tobacco, profane and obscene language are 
strictly forbidden. 
14. Conduct in corridors, cloak rooms, and toilet 
rooms—Pupils are required to go up and down stairs and 
through corridors quietly and without loitering. Congre- 
gating in corridors and halls, cloak rooms, and toilet 
rooms, loud talking, running, and scuffing in the building 
are forbidden. Pupils should understand that what one 
can do all can do, and that if all were to congregate, run, 
and scuffle in the building there could be no order. 
15. Injury to property—Any pupil who shall injure or 
deface any school building, equipment, or apparatus, 
accidentally or otherwise; or shall defile them by marks, 
pictures, or otherwise, shall make good such injury or 
defacement and shall be liable to punishment according 
to the nature of the offense. Pupils that will resort to 
such tricks lack good breeding and are disloyal to the 
school. They are not smart, clever, or funny, but are 
enemies to the school and should be shunned by all self- 
respecting boys and girls. 
16. Keeping floors clean—Pupils should exercise care 
in keeping floors as clean as possible. All waste paper 
should be deposited in waste-paper baskets. Paper 
should not be torn into bits and placed in or on the desk 
where it is likely to fall on the floor. Each pupil should
-P-A-G-E-164
    148 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
see to it that the floor around his desk is kept as clean as 
possible. 
17. Making up back work—Pupils who have been 
absent one or more days must make up the work missed 
as soon as possible. Any pupil who through irregularity 
of attendance or for other causes fails to maintain his 
standing in the grade to which he belongs, may be re- 
duced to a lower grade unless such work is made up and 
passed by a satisfactory examination before the begin- 
ning of the next school year. 
18. Absence from reviews or examinations—Pupils 
who have been absent from reviews or examinations shall 
be required to take such reviews or examinations before 
receiving grades for the work or going forward with the 
class. 
19. Credits in arrear—High school pupils who are 
more than two credits in arrear shall be classified with 
the grade below. At the beginning of the second half 
of the senior year a pupil must not be more than one 
credit in arrear, and must be carrying enough work sat- 
isfactorily to have thirty-two credits at the end of the 
year. 
20. Taking books or school property from building— 
No reference books or other school property should be 
taken from the room or school building without consent 
of the teacher or person in charge. 
21. Class meetings and parties—Pupils are not per- 
mitted to hold class meetings or parties without permis- 
sion from their teacher, faculty advisor, or sponsor. 
22. Four subjects in high school—High school pupils 
shall carry work in four regular subjects. Pupils with 
exceptional records may, however, with the consent of
-P-A-G-E-165
    RULES AND REGULATIONS 149 
the superintendent and principal, carry extra work, and 
pupils with poor health or for other acceptable reasons 
may carry less than four regular subjects. 
Suggestions to Parents 
1. Duties and Responsibilities of parents—“The child 
is the greatest thing in the world and the education of the 
child is the greatest work in the world.” The education 
of their children is the most sacred duty that devolves 
upon parents during life. This duty cannot be delegated 
entirely to teachers. The school is an important factor 
in the education of the child, and the teacher has a great 
responsibility, but the duties and responsibilities of the 
parents are primary and must not be neglected if the 
child is to develop into a useful and intelligent citizen. 
Parents should seek to codperate with the school officials 
and teachers in all matters pertaining to the best interests 
of the schools. 
2. Get acquainted with the teacher—Get acquainted 
with the teachers of your children. Lend your influence 
and encouragement by visiting their classes occasionally 
and showing your appreciation of work well done. 
3. Insist on regular attendance—Insist upon regular 
attendance and encourage your children to remain in 
school. Do not permit outside influences to detract their 
attention from school work or allow anything but illness 
to keep them out of school. Children who are required 
or allowed to remain out of school occasionally, or from 
time to time, usually get behind in their work, become 
discouraged, and quit before they have finished even the 
elementary grades. 
4, Home study—See to it that your child does what- 
 
-P-A-G-E-166
150 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
ever home study is necessary for satisfactory progress in 
school. 
5. Examinations and report cards—Each semester is 
divided into three six-week periods. In all grades above 
the fourth examinations or tests are given at the end of 
the six-week periods, and final examinations are given 
at the end of each semester. In making up grades ex- 
aminations count one-third. Report cards are sent to 
parents at the close of each six-week period. They are 
for the benefit of parents as well as for the pupils. 
Parents can do much to encourage pupils by showing an 
interest in these cards and by codperating with teachers 
whenever the report cards show unsatisfactory work. It 
may be said that many pupils are interested in and con- 
cerned about their grade and report cards only to the 
extent that their parents are interested and concerned. 
6. Enrolling beginners—Beginning pupils should not 
be allowed to enter at any time during the school year, 
or before their fifth birthday occurs. Except in schools 
where semi-annual promotions are possible, a beginning 
class should be organized only at the first of the school 
year and pupils should not be allowed to enroll later than 
two weeks after the opening of school. In consolidated 
schools where beginners are obliged to remain at school 
as many hours as upper-grade pupils there is still more 
reason for not allowing them to enter school until after 
they are five years of age. 
7. Complaints—Any parent or guardian who is dis- 
satisfied or aggrieved for any cause which is within the 
jurisdiction of the superintendent, or for which the 
superintendent should under ordinary circumstances be 
held responsible, should make application for redress to 
 
-P-A-G-E-167
  RULES AND REGULATIONS 151 
the superintendent. If he fails to get redress or satisfac- 
tory adjustment in this way, he may make application 
to the board. Since it is the superintendent’s business 
to see that all school work and activities are properly 
conducted and that all children are properly cared for, 
this is the logical and correct method of procedure. 
8. Adjusting misunderstandings—In visiting a 
teacher to adjust a misunderstanding, do so outside of 
regular school hours. Remember there are two sides to 
every question. When you have heard what your child 
has to say talk the matter over with the teacher before 
forming your opinion or judgment. The teacher has a 
difficult place to fill and, except in extreme cases, parents 
cannot afford to oppose her in maintaining order, or to 
criticize her work in the presence of children.

  CHAPTER X 
SUPERVISION 
The superintendent of a smaller school system is also 
the chief supervisor of instruction, and since the instruc- 
tion of boys and girls is the chief and ultimate aim of 
and the only justification for a school system, he must, 
in order to be successful, know how to supervise and 
direct the work of teachers according to the most ap- 
proved methods. 
It is quite evident that no complete or extensive treat- 
ment of the supervision of instruction could be given in 
a book of this nature. It is believed, however, that a 
brief treatment of a limited number of the more impor- 
tant considerations and principles, together with refer- 
ences, will be helpful. The suggestions and illustrations 
given in this and those following chapters which pertain 
to matters of instruction, are based in part on the writer’s 
own experiences and studies, and partly on a critical 
reading of various other works. 
Supervision in large and small school systems—The 
problems of supervision which directly concern a super- 
intendent of schools vary greatly with the size of the 
school system. The problems which immediately con- 
front the superintendent of a large school system include 
such matters as organization and distribution of 
supervisory functions; duties of general and special 
152
-P-A-G-E-169
     
SUPERVISION 153 
supervisors; and supervision by subjects, grades, and 
districts. These need not be considered in a work of this 
nature, intended primarily for inexperienced superin- 
tendents and those of smaller school systems. On the 
other hand, the superintendent of a smaller system, being 
his own supervisor of instruction, is directly concerned 
with the presentation and execution of methods and 
devices, as well as with the planning and laying out of 
the work. Besides giving definite information and direc- 
tions for the carrying out of his plans and suggestions he 
must be able to demonstrate and execute the methods 
and devices offered, to encourage and inspire teachers, 
and to bring about results directly through his own 
efforts. 
An inexperienced superintendent should understand 
that good supervision, like good teaching, is based more 
and more on definite knowledge; that to be a good super- 
intendent he must also be a good supervisor of instruc- 
tion; and good supervision calls for familiarity with the 
latest and best means and methods employed in teaching 
the various subjects. 
Need of supervision—Supervision is a matter the im- 
portance of which is too often misunderstood, especially 
on the part of board members and citizens of smaller 
communities where superintendent, principal, and super- 
visors of such work as music, penmanship, and drawing, 
are all required to teach regular classes. There is a 
tendency to think that well-trained and especially 
experienced teachers should be able to teach their sub- 
jects without supervision. 
Economy of effort and unity of purpose calls for com- 
petent supervision in any school system. No matter how
-P-A-G-E-170
154 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
well and extensive a teacher’s first training may have 
been, or how long she may have taught a given grade, if 
she is to keep abreast with the best methods and with 
changing social conditions and advancement, there must 
be more or less continuous training and supervision. If 
there is to be continuous progress on the part of pupils, 
without waste of time and effort through unnecessary 
repetition, needless duplication, and omissions of impor- 
tant matter, the work of the individual teachers must 
be codrdinated and directed. Someone must make a 
study of and correlate the various and separate parts of 
the work carried out by the different teachers with re- 
spect to the program as a whole. Without this there 
can be no unity of purpose, and no common standards of 
requirements and attainments can be developed. The 
individual teacher is, as a rule, too close to her work to 
see it in its true relation to that of other grades and 
departments, and to recognize the ever-changing require- 
ments set up by society. Furthermore, she has not been 
trained for and has very little opportunity to make a 
first-hand study of the best available subject-matter and 
latest methods of instruction. She does not have the 
advantage of comparison and cannot be expected to have 
the wider outlook and sense of relationship gained by the 
superintendent or supervisor, no matter how long she 
may have taught a given grade or subject. 
If individual teachers of a school system were to follow 
their own ideas as to course of study, subject-matter, and 
methods of teaching, disorder and chaos would be the 
result, and the loss in time, effort, and money would be 
out of all proportions to that required for effective 
supervision.
-P-A-G-E-171
  SUPERVISION 155 
Time necessary for supervision—A superintendent of 
even a small school with few teachers cannot be of any 
great help as a supervisor of instruction if he himself has 
a full program of classroom work. During the periods 
that his own classes meet he will be unable to visit other 
teachers, and in order to make helpful suggestions, or to 
speak with authority on any phase of a teacher’s work, 
he must make a careful study of her work. This he 
cannot do unless he can visit the teacher’s classes occa- 
sionally and confer with her concerning what he observed 
during his visit. 
On the other hand, economy will not permit of too 
much time given to the supervision of a few teachers 
in a small school system, but it does not follow from this 
that the superintendent should make no attempt to 
supervise instruction. Occasionally it may not be im- 
practicable or inadvisable for him to give his class a 
written lesson which can be cared for in the assembly 
room by the assembly-room teacher, or by some teacher 
who may have a vacant period. It is usually possible, 
too, to shift a class period occasionally in order that the 
superintendent may visit the teacher’s class. The con- 
ference with the teacher following such a visit can be 
held before or after regular class work or school hours. 
Helpful suggestions can also be made at teacher’s meet- 
ings, especially if the number of teachers is small. This 
can be done by having teachers check up on their own 
work according to a list of questions or directions made 
out by the superintendent, and by reporting on any 
phase of their work concerning which they may have 
difficulty or doubt. Teachers may also be required to 
submit weekly lesson plans from time to time. If a copy  
-P-A-G-E-172
Sa a a res HS ee i eee 
156 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
of the teacher’s daily program is posted in her room and 
a copy filed in the superintendent’s office he will, of 
course, know at all times what subject-matter is being 
covered and the amount of time allotted to each subject. 
Experience necessary for helpful supervision—The 
value of teaching experience as a basis for ability to 
supervise the work of teachers cannot be overemphasized. 
One of the most serious handicaps to our small schools 
at present is the fact that too many of those employed as 
superintendents have had little or no experience. Not 
only have they had no experience as supervisors or ad- 
ministrators, but often they are men who have not even 
had teaching experience, and who have little understand- 
ing of what is involved in assuming a position as head of 
the schools of a community. Often, too, they are not 
really interested in school work and do not intend to 
prepare for a career as school superintendent, but take 
up the work for a year or two as a stepping stone to 
something else or because it affords an immediate living 
income. 
It is needless to say that these men cannot supervise 
the work of teachers in a helpful way. All they can do 
is to experiment and pretend until they have gained a 
certain amount of definite and practical knowledge, 
which in their case is usually gained by “hit-or-miss” 
methods. This is the most expensive type of superin- 
tendent that a community can employ, and the most 
costly kind of supervision. In short, one who is not pre- 
pared to superintend or supervise should not receive 
money from the public for this purpose. He should seek 
employment in a field in which the welfare of so many 
is not dependent upon his success.

SUPERVISION 157 
Attitude of teachers toward supervision—In smaller 
school systems where there has been no competent 
supervision of instruction and where each teacher has 
been allowed to follow her own methods and ideas, there 
is likely at first to be more or less resentment or opposi- 
tion to supervision. This is true especially where ex- 
perienced teachers, who have been considered successful, 
are asked to take directions and advice from younger 
superintendents or supervisors. It is here that tact and 
diplomacy are required, and where an inexperienced 
superintendent is likely to become dictatorial or auto- 
cratic. Such a situation does not, as a rule, call for 
immediate action, on the part of the superintendent but 
rather for patience and a better understanding. He 
should, under such circumstances, be exceedingly careful, 
and absolutely sure of his ground. He should realize that 
he may be mistaken, and that there may be considerable 
justification for resentment and doubt on the part of the 
teacher. In the past much of the so-called supervision 
of instruction has not only failed to be of any real value, 
but has only added useless burdens to the task of the 
already overworked teacher. Entirely too much of what 
has been demanded of teachers in the past by so-called 
supervisors or experts, or in the name of professional 
training, has missed the mark. And while much progress 
has been made in recent years, we have also introduced 
much humbug. 
The first and most important consideration in super- 
vision is a clear understanding of its aim and purpose, 
and a sympathetic codperation on the part of all teachers. 
Superintendents and supervisors should understand first 
that it is their duty to help teachers, and teachers should
-P-A-G-E-174
  158 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
be made to understand from the first that their interest 
is identical with that of the superintendent or supervisor. 
If the superintendent or supervisor is sincere and 
honest in his efforts to help the teacher, if he is diplo- 
matic and sympathetic, if he knows his business and has 
something definite or worthwhile to offer, he will, as a 
rule, find teachers anxious and glad to codperate with 
him. This means that he must be able to determine the 
relative value of the methods employed in teaching, and 
must be acquainted with some of the more recent stand- 
ards in order to measure the efficiency of the teacher’s 
work. It means that he must study the needs of the 
individual teacher and be willing to adjust his methods 
of help to fit her particular situation and temperament. 
He must not become impatient with teachers who at first 
can see only their side of a problem or situation, but must 
make allowance for the fact that they have not had the 
advantage of advanced training in supervision, or an 
opportunity to compare the work and methods of differ- 
ent teachers and schools. He must know the subject- 
matter and its relative value to the children, as well as 
what instructions are actually given and the condition 
under which they are given. He must be able to offer 
definite suggestions for improvement or help, encourage 
and inspire better efforts; and guard against mere fault- 
finding, unreasonable requirements, and personal feelings. 
In short, to bring about and maintain the right attitude 
of teachers toward supervision of instruction, a superin- 
tendent must gain and hold their respect. This he 
cannot do without convincing them that he knows his 
business, and that he is sincere in his efforts to improve 
their efficiency and worth. He should always be as ready
-P-A-G-E-175
  SUPERVISION 159 
to give credit to a teacher for meritorious work as criticize 
her for poor work. 
Chancellor, in his book, Our Schools, Their Adminis- 
tration and Supervision, very aptly says: “The good 
supervisor thinks very often of the thirteenth chapter 
of a great teacher’s letter to his coworkers at Corinth. 
For good supervision ‘suffereth long and is kind, is not 
puffed up, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, en- 
dureth all things, never faileth.’” 
Kinds of criticism—To criticize a teacher's work 
effectively and without antagonizing, offending, or 
humiliating her, is an art which often calls for a fine 
sense of discrimination and judgment of human nature, 
as well as a thorough understanding of the teacher’s 
work. All criticism should be helpful and constructive, 
and relative to the conditions under which the teacher is 
working. Even criticism concerning poor work and 
failure can be discussed very frankly and in a construc- 
tive, encouraging, and impersonal manner if the superin- 
tendent or supervisor knows his business. Mere fault- 
finding or tearing down of a teacher’s work without 
offering anything better is not only useless but destruc- 
tive. A good supervisor will always strive to find and 
express his appreciation of something good in a teacher’s 
work. He will also realize and make allowance for the 
fact that the teacher like himself is human; that she has 
her “off days”; and that what she most needs at times is 
inspiration and encouragement. 
The condition of the room—Careful attention should 
be given to the condition of light, heat, and ventilation 
in every room. Many teachers become very careless or 
indifferent about the condition of their room or the
-P-A-G-E-176
  160 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
comfort of their pupils, and need to be definitely in- 
structed from time to time concerning their duties with 
respect to these matters. 
Window shades should, whenever possible, be so ad- 
justed that the light comes from above. Pupils should 
not be required to face a strong light or to strain their 
eyes. 
It is generally held that the temperature of the room 
should not be over seventy degrees Fahrenheit. Many 
hold that from sixty-five to sixty-eight degrees is pref- 
erable to seventy degrees. In order to keep the tempera- 
ture of a room properly regulated it is quite necessary 
to have a reliable thermometer in the room, and so placed 
that it is not affected by external conditions. 
The ventilation of a room is often a difficult problem, 
especially in older buildings that were planned with little 
regard for proper ventilation. The ventilation of such 
buildings must usually be secured by opening windows 
and doors. Where this method is employed, and where- 
ever it is possible, windows and doors should be opened 
on opposite sides of the room in order to permit the air 
to circulate through the room. It is better, too, to raise 
a few windows from the bottom and lower those on the 
opposite side from the top. In case there are windows 
on one side of the room only it is best to raise them 
slightly from the bottom and also lower them from the 
top. Where it is difficult to avoid a direct draft or to 
keep the room properly heated, it is best to open all 
windows and doors on opposite sides of the room for a 
few minutes during each recess and noon hour. 
The lighting, heating, and ventilating of the room
-P-A-G-E-177
  SUPERVISION 161 
have a direct and important bearing upon the efficiency 
of a pupil’s work as well as upon his health. 
References—A good superintendent or supervisor will 
realize that as leader or director of a teacher’s work he 
is in a large measure responsible for her success. He will 
therefore strive to familiarize himself with all available 
resources of helpful literature and reference material. 
He will be prepared to refer teachers to specific informa- 
tion and suggestions that bear directly on their problems, 
and will see to it that this material is made available 
to them. He will direct teachers as far as possible in 
just what to look for and how to find it in the shortest 
time and most convenient way. He will know that gen- 
eral references given at a teacher’s meeting cannot be 
relied upon to bring results. 
A good way for a beginning superintendent or super- 
visor to do is to visit a teacher’s class, make a careful 
study of her work to find out just where she needs help, 
and then check up to see what is available that bears 
with sufficient directness on the matter in question. He 
can do nothing better than to see that the reference ma- 
terial for teachers, as well as that for pupils, is carefully 
selected and that their reading is properly directed. He 
should familiarize himself thoroughly with the material 
if not already familiar with it, and place it before the 
teachers or see that it is made accessible to them. It is 
well to give one or more exact page references from two 
or more different books or sources. In some instances, 
and especially with older or experienced teachers, refer- 
ences to the index or table of contents may be given. If 
the references given consist of several books or items,
-P-A-G-E-178
  162 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
teachers should be required to make a note of these in 
writing and should be held responsible for reading them. 
Such assignments should always be followed up later 
with a visit and a conference between the teacher and 
superintendent. Where no written note is made of pages 
or specific assignments and where no checking is done 
later to see that the references have been read, some 
teachers will always shirk or contend they could find 
nothing pertaining to the matter. Such indefiniteness 
is likely to lead to cunning evasions, guessing, and 
bluffing on the part of certain teachers. 
Visitations and observation—A superintendent of a 
small school system should plan to visit the various 
teachers at different hours of the day as often as his time 
will permit. Mere visiting, however, is not supervising. 
The benefits to be derived from a visit depend on what 
he is able and willing to do for the teacher after observing 
her work. At the beginning of the term the teachers with 
the least training and experience for their work should 
be cared for first, and will, of course, need more atten- 
tion than those who have had more preparation and 
experience. 
As often as possible the visit should extend over the 
entire recitation period so that the lesson plan, order of 
procedure, and assignment can be observed, as well as 
methods of questioning and presentation, self-possession, 
and discipline. It is easy to misjudge a teacher’s work 
by visiting her room for a few minutes at a time. A 
young and inexperienced teacher, especially, is likely to 
be more or less disturbed or uneasy when a superintend- 
ent first enters her room to check on her work. If she 
is at all conscientious she will realize that she may not
-P-A-G-E-179
SUPERVISION 163 
at this time be able to meet all requirements, and is 
therefore likely not to be at her best. If she is to be 
judged by his observations she is entitled to have all her 
work seen, not only once but again after she has had an 
opportunity to confer with him concerning the work, and 
has received his suggestions or criticisms. 
Whenever the visit calls for a disarrangement of the 
teacher’s work for the benefit of the superintendent’s 
information, she should be informed beforehand as to 
when he expects to come and what he should like to have 
her keep in mind or be prepared to demonstrate. Such 
previous information on the part of a young and inex- 
perienced teacher will often prevent embarrassment. 
For a superintendent to inform a teacher beforehand 
when he expects to visit her room, what he expects to 
check on, and what he should like to find, is an effective 
way of bringing about an end sought. 
Since the superintendent is expected to be familiar 
with the subject-matter covered in the various grades 
and departments, as well as with the best methods of 
presenting it, he should, whenever it seems advisable, 
give a demonstration lesson, especially before the less- 
experienced teacher. Such lessons should, of course, be 
well planned and prepared, and should clearly bring out 
the method or principle which he desires to have the 
teacher employ. 
A teacher should never be criticized before her class. 
Both superintendent and teacher should always treat 
each other respectfully and courteously before children. 
Unfavorable criticism and differences of opinion should 
be given and discussed in private. The superintendent 
should be a friend and advisor to the teacher. His rela- 
 
-P-A-G-E-180
  164 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
tion and attitude toward her should at all times be such 
that she will feel free to consult him about matters per- 
taining to her work and the welfare of the school. He 
should bear in mind that the chief purpose of supervision 
is the improvement of instruction for the good of the 
child. 
What to look for in visiting a room—Upon visiting a 
room a superintendent should be cheerful and calm in 
order to avoid any fear or uneasiness on the part of 
teacher or pupils. He should be alert and observing, 
however, and able to size up a situation from what he 
sees. The following are some of the things to be observed 
while visiting a room for the purpose of supervision: 
1. Condition of room with respect to temperature, 
ventilation, and lighting. 
2. Orderliness, and arrangement of teacher’s and 
pupils’ desk, bookracks, cloakroom, etc. 
8. Condition of floor and blackboard. 
4, Bearing, voice, manner, and _ self-possession of 
teacher. 
5. Is the teacher observing and alert, natural or 
mechanical? 
6. Are teacher and pupils interested in or enthusiastic 
about the lesson, or does the work seem monotonous and 
the teacher and pupils bored and weary? 
7. Is the teacher able to hold the attention of the class? 
8. Is the teacher well prepared or does she depend too 
much on the use of the text book? 
9. Does the teacher understand the art of questioning? 
10. Does she have good command of English? 
11. Does she make wise use of time, supplies, and 
materials?
-P-A-G-E-181
  SUPERVISION 165 
12. Does she observe the time schedule for recitations? 
13. Are pupils held responsible for the preparation of 
their lessons? 
14. Are pupils respectful to teacher and responsive to 
questions asked or are they indifferent and their answers 
evasive? 
15. Are pupils properly seated, do they speak up well 
when questioned, and stand erect when standing? 
16. Does the teacher seem to understand children and 
make allowance for individual differences? 
17. Is the lesson well assigned? 
Observation blanks—In large school systems where a 
regular supervisor of instruction must supervise the 
work of many teachers, it is quite necessary and now 
quite common to use printed forms of observation blanks, 
or visitation cards as they are sometimes called. Various 
of these forms are in use. They are usually made in 
different colors to be filled in in duplicate or triplicate by 
the use of carbon paper. When these forms are filled in a 
copy is left with the teacher and one is filed by the super- 
intendent, or in case of triplicates, the teacher, supervisor, 
and superintendent may all file copies. Such a form 
containing a limited number of pivotal questions or fac- 
tors to be observed, if carefully worked out and adapted 
to the system, has many advantages and may be used to 
good purpose by superintendents of smaller school sys- 
tems. The number of items, arrangement, etc. may be 
varied to suit the superintendent. 
The following form will serve as an illustration or may 
be used as a guide for making a suitable form for any 
school system:

SUPERVISION 167 
The majority of the foregoing items can be ranked by 
the use of the initial letters of the words Excellent, Good, 
Fair, Unsatisfactory, Poor; in terms of per cent; or ac- 
cording to some other system or scheme. 
On the other side of the blank numbers may be given 
to correspond with the numbers of the items on this side. 
Comments or additional notes can thus be made on any 
item. These may be added after the visit, in the super- 
visor’s office. 
Benefits derived from the use of an observation 
blank—The benefits to be derived from the use of an 
observation blank may be summarized as follows: 
1. The blanks concerning any teacher’s work will be- 
come more and more helpful and effective as they ac- 
cumulate in the office. 
2. It will aid a superintendent in rating all teachers 
more nearly on the same scale or according to the same 
standard. 
8. It will tend to eliminate the personal equation. 
4. It keeps before a teacher her own rating and enables 
her to make direct efforts to improve any defects or 
shortcomings that may be recorded on the blank. 
5. It enables a superintendent to see just what recom- 
mendations and suggestions were made to a teacher 
before, and whether or not she is profiting by such 
recommendations and suggestions. 
6. The blanks may be used as evidence concerning any 
item recorded in case of a dispute later between super- 
intendent and teacher. 
7. The blanks will serve as a basis for topics to be dis- 
cussed at conferences or teachers’ meetings. 
8. A teacher can at any time use her copies of the 
blanks in making application for another position. 
 
-P-A-G-E-184
  168 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
9. The blanks may be used as an aid in determining 
a teacher’s promotion, reélection, or dismissal. 
Limitations of observation blanks—While many ad- 
vantages can be pointed out for the use of a carefully 
worked-out observation blank, it should be emphasized 
here that to use such a blank intelligently for rating a 
teacher’s work calls for an understanding of its limita- 
tions and defects as well as its merits and advantages. 
The writer is inclined to think that in the past too much 
has been claimed for many of the devices designed for 
objective measurements. The advisability of using any 
form of rating blank as a sole basis for judging a teacher 
is highly questionable. Unless one is a good judge of the 
relative importance of the various elements and factors 
involved directly and indirectly, and knows the condi- 
tions under which the items have been ranked, he cannot 
use the information intelligently. Rating blanks may 
afford valuable information of detailed items or factors 
to be used as supplementary information in forming 
a final estimate of a teacher’s worth, but a superintendent 
or supervisor should realize that it is quite impossible to 
record all the factors that enter into good teaching; that 
the subject-matter or teaching of no two lessons is alike; 
that much of what constitutes good ability to teach a 
subject day after day is the resultant or precipitate of 
many varied abilities and experiences; and that such 
factors as general teaching ability, personality, deter- 
mination, influence, inspiration and sympathy cannot 
be disregarded. 
Helping inexperienced teachers—In smaller school 
systems where a young man is likely to obtain his first 
experience as supervisor a proportionately large number
-P-A-G-E-185
  SUPERVISION 169 
of the teachers employed are also likely to be inexperi- 
enced. This makes his problem of supervision doubly 
difficult. He does not always understand the problems 
and needs of inexperienced teachers at this time, and is 
therefore not always prepared to advise and direct them. 
Hence it is very important that he have had at least 
some special training for this particular work. Many a 
sincere and lovely girl has failed in the teaching game 
because of the abysmal ignorance of so-called superin- 
tendents or supervisors. 
The notion that those who have had sufficient train- 
ing in normal training schools or colleges should be pre- 
pared to take up their work as teachers without any 
difficulty, and without much help or guidance, is still 
too prevalent. In normal training schools, and espe- 
cially in many of our colleges, the acquisition of knowl- 
edge is the chief consideration. But development in 
the art of successful teaching requires actual practice 
under varying conditions in the classroom, and under 
proper direction and guidance. 
The importance of exercising great care in the selec- 
tion of teachers has already been treated in a previous 
chapter. With respect to this it need only be said here 
that those responsible for the selection of a teacher for a 
particular grade or subject are also jointly responsible 
for her success. 
A superintendent should realize that the first days of 
an inexperienced teacher are the most decisive as well 
as the most trying ones; that the first few weeks are likely 
to mark her for success or failure; and that with her 
success or failure he will have much to do. He will, if he 
is prepared to do his duty, have many excellent oppor-
-P-A-G-E-186
  170 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
tunities to help her. And it is plainly his duty to help 
her plan her work, and to instruct her against possible 
pitfalls of any kind. He should instruct her to be on the 
job two or more days before the schools open, in order 
to familiarize herself with the working surroundings and 
the more important rules and regulations, as well as with 
the text books used, reference material, etc. He should 
help her to find a suitable boarding and rooming place, 
and should inform her of any social requirements or 
restrictions peculiar to the community. If she is young 
and inexperienced it is not out of place to impress upon 
her at this time the importance of her conduct on the 
street and in social gatherings, as well as the importance 
of regular habits of eating, sleeping, and exercise. 
It is during the first few days that both patrons and 
pupils are inclined to be most critical and exacting with 
a new teacher, and especially is this true if she is young 
and inexperienced. They will watch for and endeavor 
to find signs of weakness and short-comings, and to test 
her out in every way. It is here, therefore, that she 
most needs advice and directions. 
A superintendent should, if at all possible, visit the 
room of a beginning teacher the morning of the first 
day before school opens, and one or more times during 
the day, in order to make any suggestions that may seem 
advisable in helping her to get started well. The fol- 
lowing days and until she has her work well in hand 
he should visit her room as often as possible in order to 
keep in close touch with her needs. He should endeavor 
to make her feel free to ask any questions, take her 
classes for demonstration purposes, and assist her with 
any problems that she may have, ; 
 
-P-A-G-E-187

Teachers should visit other rooms and schools— 
Teachers can learn much by observing the work of suc- 
cessful teachers in other rooms and schools. Demon- 
strations of well-planned and well-prepared lessons by 
experienced and successful teachers are, as a rule, very 
helpful to a teacher who is endeavoring to improve her 
own methods of work. Watching experts do what we 
ourselves have been doing in a less efficient manner, or 
have attempted to do, is a very good way to become 
expert. 
A wise superintendent will see to it that his teachers 
are given an opportunity to observe especially good work 
of other teachers. In many of the more progressive 
school systems of the United States one or more days are 
allowed for visiting and observing the work of teachers 
in other buildings and cities. A superintendent should 
not, however, simply ask or urge that teachers visit in- 
discriminately, but should concern himself to find out 
where good work is being done, and direct his teachers 
in order that they may see work that will be most help- 
ful to them individually. 
When visiting other schools some teachers are in- 
clined always to look for defects and inferior work, and 
to compare this with the good features of their own work. 
They should be directed and instructed to look for some- 
thing good to bring home. Nothing is gained by endeav- 
oring to prove one’s own work superior to that of others. 
Waits, in his Practical Problems of the School, quotes 
President-Emeritus Eliot of Harvard as saying that it 
requires a much higher type of intelligence to discern 
the good in others than to criticize the evils involved in 
their work.
-P-A-G-E-188
  172 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
Spirit—A good superintendent will strive to promote 
harmony and coéperation, and a good spirit and attitude 
of mind on the part of all teachers and pupils. Spirit is 
that intangible something that does not lend itself to 
mathematical measurements or mechanical regulation. 
A good spirit on the part of a teacher is an animating 
force and a moving power. Generally, it means interest 
and optimism, a cheerful attitude, and a hopeful out- 
look. These are essential characteristics of a good 
teacher, and where they are possessed by the teacher they 
are almost invariably reflected in the attitude and work 
of her pupils. 
It may be said that the spirit of the school as shown 
by the general attitude of the teachers and pupils, is 
probably the best single index to its standing and effi- 
ciency. It is the general spirit and atmosphere of the 
school more than anything else that reflects the success 
of both teachers and pupils. To quote Hollister, “The 
real effect of school discipline, under whatever form, is 
to be found in the general spirit which pervades the 
school. The spirit will be manifested to the careful 
observer in the general attitude of pupils toward their 
work, their teachers, and their general surroundings.” 
In the words of T. E. Sanders, “Buildings, grounds, fur- 
niture, apparatus, books, all these are important—and 
the material equipment of a school makes much dif- 
ference—but over and above these and vastly more im- 
portant than these, is the spirit of the teachers.” 
A good school spirit means interest in regular class- 
room work and scholarship, as well as in social functions 
and outside activities. Mere class rivalry and fights, or 
the display of animal spirit sometimes shown by boys
-P-A-G-E-189
  
SUPERVISION 173 
and girls on the playground, or during games and con- 
tests in the gymnasium or on the athletic field, should 
not be mistaken for a good school spirit. Students’ 
pranks and foolish class fights do not represent a good 
school spirit, and care should be exercised to prevent the 
development of any mischievous or malicious class spirit. 
This tends to divide the school rather than to unify it. 
Such a spirit on the part of separate classes, if tolerated, 
may become very destructive to the regular school work.

  CHAPTER XI 
GUIDING AND DIRECTING STUDY 
There is a growing conviction that more attention 
should be given to the guiding and directing of the pupil’s 
study. Intelligent direction in training pupils to apply 
their energy in the most economical and productive way 
is one of the most important, and probably the most 
neglected, of a teacher’s training and of her duties. “The 
habits of study formed in school are of greater impor- 
tance than the subjects mastered.” 
Much of our so-called supervised study is not directed 
study and does not teach pupils how to study effectively. 
The efficiency of the work in the average school could 
be greatly increased by giving more serious attention 
to this matter. A superintendent should strive to 
familiarize himself as far as possible with the best prin- 
ciples and methods available for teaching pupils how 
to study effectively, and instruct his teachers in teaching 
pupils how to apply these principles and methods. 
Some of the more important principles and considera- 
tions are treated briefly in this chapter. It is believed 
that a critical review of these will be found helpful. The 
summary arrangement of suggestions and rules may be 
used as a guide for making typewritten or mimeographed 
copies to be given to teachers from time to time, or they 
may be used as a basis of discussions at teachers’ 
meetings.

Waste due to wrong study habits—It is only during 
recent years that attention has been called to the waste of 
time and energy due to wrong methods of study, and to 
the importance of guiding and directing pupils in the 
preparation of their lessons. Many of us remember too 
well our own experiences—the time and efforts spent in 
fruitless attempts to solve a problem or comprehend a 
principle which, if our efforts had been properly directed, 
could have been done in much less time, without diffi- 
culty, and with as much benefit to ourselves. Many 
go through the grades and high school without learning 
how to study properly. They do not learn where or 
how to look for information, how to proceed in selecting 
or culling essentials, how to plan solutions, or how to 
organize and use the information obtained. 
McMurry, in his How to Study, tells of one of his girl 
companions at high school who not only read her history 
aloud, but as she read she stopped to repeat each sentence 
five times with great vigor. During his attendance at 
college the writer overheard a young man studying a 
physiology lesson by reading and repeating aloud sev- 
eral times each sentence in the text book. At another 
time ke heard a teacher of an ancient history class in 
high school ask different members of the class to sum- 
marize a given chapter, and found that the majority of 
the pupils did not know what she meant by summarizing 
the chapter. 
It is probably true that more waste of time and energy 
in our schools today is due to a lack of well-directed 
study than to any other cause. In the words of Hall- 
Quest: “If the host of children and young people in 
American schools today could be taught how to study,
-P-A-G-E-192
    176 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
how to use their intellects, how to master quickly and 
with skill all of those problems which at present occupy 
so much time in the school year it would be possible to 
give each boy and girl a real vocational preparation and 
send them forth ready for effective service at a time 
when large numbers are now battling with new condi- 
tions in the first year of the high school.” 1 
Many teachers need directions—In view of the pre- 
ceding facts it is not surprising to find that many teachers 
have not been taught how to study and that they need to 
be directed in order to teach their pupils how. Dr. Lida 
B. Earhart in her investigation, Systematic Study of 
Elementary Schools, found that out of 165 teachers, who 
had had good training on the whole, and most of whom 
had taught several years in elementary schools, about 
two-thirds, according to their own statements, had never 
received systematic instruction on how to study, and 
that more than one-half of the remainder had been 
taught to memorize in studying. 
The physical condition of the pupil—We are begin- 
ning to realize that maximum efficiency calls for a maxi- 
mum of good health, and that many a case of retardation, 
lack of interest, and seeming indifference or laziness is 
due to the pupil’s physical condition. Defective eye- 
sight, impaired adenoids, decaying teeth, catarrh, etc., 
all interfere more or less seriously with the intellectual 
work and mental development of the pupil. 
Where there is no regular or visiting nurse in the 
school system the superintendent should instruct teach- 
ers, as far as possible, to watch for and report any physi- 
cal defects, as well as the first symptoms of contagious

  GUIDING AND DIRECTING STUDY 177 
diseases. It is his duty to safeguard to the best of his 
ability all pupils from diseases, and to preserve a proper 
balance between their physical and their intellectual 
development. 
Instructing children in health habits—Children should 
be carefully instructed from the first grade on with re- 
spect to the proper care of their teeth and eyes; proper 
posture and breathing; and proper habits of eating, sleep- 
ing, and exercise. There is a strong tendency now-a- 
days for pupils to eat too much and too hurriedly, sleep 
too little, and, among the older and more studious ones, 
to neglect necessary exercise. Whenever it becomes evi- 
dent that a child’s progress at school is being retarded 
through some physical defect, or through lack of proper 
care and guidance with respect to eating, sleeping and 
exercise at home, the case should be reported at once, 
and an effort should be made to codperate with parents 
in correcting the defect or faulty condition. Many par- 
ents are ignorant or very careless concerning the physical 
welfare of their children, but if they can be convinced of 
the necessity or importance of correcting a defect or 
faulty condition, they are as a rule not only willing but 
anxious to codperate with the school to bring about the 
correction needed. 
In order to work effectively at school children must eat 
a proper amount of wholesome food at regular hours, 
and have plenty of sleep, fresh air, and exercise. It is 
generally held that children in the lower grades should 
sleep at least ten hours out of each twenty-four. Small 
children should never be required to remain in their 
seats during a prolonged period, but should have frequent 
intermissions during which they should exercise all parts
-P-A-G-E-194
  178 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
of their bodies. Hopping, skipping, running, jumping, 
and exercises or games in ring formation are best suited 
for short periods of indoor recreation. 
The adolescent—The intelligent instructor will also 
understand and make allowance for the important physi- 
cal and mental changes that take place during the period 
of adolescence, and the attitude, mood, and behavior 
which are often the result of these changes. This period 
is frequently characterized by clumsiness, self-conscious- 
ness, emotional tendencies, and strong imagination, due 
to the rapid growth and newly acquired interests and 
desires. It is during this period especially that youths 
require careful supervision and counsel, as well as whole- 
some environment, and plenty of interesting activity. 
It is here, where, in the words of G. Stanley Hall, “Youth 
awakens to a new world and understands neither it nor 
himself. The whole future of life depends on how the 
new powers now given suddenly and in profusion are 
husbanded and directed. Character and personality are 
taking form, but everything is plastic. Self-feeling and 
ambition are increased, and every trait and faculty is 
liable to exaggeration and excess. It is all a marvelous 
new birth, and those who believe that nothing is so 
worthy of love, reverence, and service as the body and 
soul of youth, and who hold that the best test of every 
human institution is how much it contributes to bring 
youth to the ever fullest possible development, may well 
review themselves and the civilization in which we live 
to see how far it satisfies this supreme test.” 
Other elements—Various other elements not infre- 
quently affect a pupil’s physical and mental well-being. 
Timidity, humiliation, and disappointments, as well as
-P-A-G-E-195
  GUIDING AND DIRECTING STUDY 179 
depressing or unsympathetic home environment lower 
a pupil’s spirit and check his mental progress; and many 
secret battles are fought to overcome these conditions. 
A skilful teacher will strive to understand her pupils 
and help them by way of encouragement or enlighten- 
ment with respect to all matters pertaining to their 
physical welfare as well as their mental progress. 
Motivating the pupil’s work—One of the first essen- 
tials in teaching boys and girls how to study is to pro- 
vide them with the proper motives—to induce, incite, or 
move them to volition by securing the proper viewpoint 
and arousing their interest. This is not always an easy 
thing to do since we cannot provide pupils in the school 
room with the realities that motivate our efforts in life 
outside of school. Sometimes it is quite impossible to 
provide a stimulus or motive that will induce all pupils 
to exert themselves in preparing a given lesson. Never- 
theless this is one of the important duties of a teacher, 
and an essential characteristic of good teaching. In this 
respect the teacher may be compared with the salesman: 
A skilful salesman carefully explains and points out the 
merits of his goods in order to arouse the buyer’s interest 
and to create a desire that will induce him to buy. Like- 
wise a skilful teacher makes her lesson assignment in 
such a way as to arouse the interest of the pupils and 
to create the desire that will induce them to master the 
lesson. 
A good teacher does not drive her pupils or attempt to 
force their interest and attention, but rather secures 
their interest, and guides their efforts through intelligent 
leadership. 
’ Various incentives and means of motivation may be
-P-A-G-E-196
  
  180 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
employed to good advantage. Among those quite com- 
monly employed are the following: 
1. Setting up definite purposes and aims.—This pro- 
motes a pupil’s interest since it enables him to know 
what to look for from the beginning. 
2. Making pupils feel the need and importance of what 
they are asked to do.—This is an incentive since it gives 
pupils a reason for doing the work assigned. 
3. Associating the work with something in which a 
pupil is already interested—In this way it is sometimes 
possible to interest a pupil in work that could not be 
made interesting to him by any other method. 
4. Grading, testing, examinations, and promotions.— 
These are effective means since nearly all pupils are 
anxious to make good grades, pass examinations, and be 
promoted. 
5. Appeal to pride—Pride is something possessed in 
varying degrees by all pupils, and a reasonable pride in 
one’s attainments or accomplishments is justifiable. To 
appeal to a pupil’s pride is therefore legitimate and is 
often an effective means of motivation. 
6. Competitive exercises and contests between groups 
or pupils of different rooms.—This is a great stimulus to 
most pupils and a good way to motivate various kinds 
of drill work. 
7. Posting charts with a record of pupils’ achieve- 
ments.—With smaller pupils especially this is an effective 
stimulus since it arouses their instinct of rivalry and 
appeals to their pride. 
8. Having pupils make graphs of their own achieve- 
ments.—To have pupils make simple diagrams symboliz- 
ing their achievement and progress, can be made an effec-
-P-A-G-E-197
  GUIDING AND DIRECTING STUDY 181 
tive means for motivating various kinds of drill work. 
Pupils generally are interested in determining their own 
progress and class standing. 
9. Planning entertainments for parents or pupils of 
other rooms.—This will generally induce older pupils as 
well as smaller ones to put forth their best efforts in order 
to make a good showing. 
10. Exhibiting a keen and lively interest in grades and 
report cards.—Where teachers and parents show the 
proper interest in and concern about the pupil’s grades 
and report cards they are a great incentive to good work. 
11. Setting definite tasks——Generally, pupils work bet- 
ter when a definite amount of work is assigned. To as- 
sign a definite number of problems to be solved in 
arithmetic, or a definite number of words to be mastered 
in spelling, is an incentive, for children and adults alike 
derive pleasure from the completion of a task. 
12. Expressing appreciation of work well done—A 
teacher should always show her appreciation of work well 
done. Children as well as adults will do more for a per- 
son who is appreciative of their efforts, and for pupils 
to strive to please their teacher is wholesome and 
legitimate. 
13. Debates between divisions of a class or between 
rooms.—In the upper grades and high school debates are 
very effective means of promoting interest, especially in 
such subjects as history or social science. 
14. A school paper put out by the pupils—A school 
paper, if properly supervised, is an excellent means for 
motivating various kinds of English work. 
Any scheme or device employed must be employed 
with intelligence. It must be suited to the pupil’s stage 
 
-P-A-G-E-198
182 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
of development, and must not be overworked. A good 
teacher will study her pupils and will constantly seek 
new means for motivating their work. She will be care- 
ful, however, not to make these means or devices end in 
themselves. 
Drill and habit formation—Habit has been defined as 
“a, condition of body or mind or both, which has been 
established by repetition of an act or mental process or 
both.” The formation of right habits is an important 
part of all learning. Not only all motor activities, but 
a large portion of the rudiments or methods of any art or 
branch of knowledge must be reduced to habit before skill 
and efficiency can be attained. According to Lockwood 
and Thorpe, “A rule is worth nothing until it becomes a 
habit.” And Dr. Frank Crane says, “One habit is worth 
a dozen rules.” Skill and efficiency in any line depends 
largely upon the rapidity, accuracy, and ease with which 
we can do our work, and these in many instances are 
acquired only by reducing our processes and perform- 
ances to habit. Each repetition of a past act can be per- 
formed with less effort or friction, and when the rudi- 
mentary processes and facts have become sufficiently 
well established they can be reproduced without delay or 
conscious effort. When this stage has been reached, and 
then only, can the mind be relieved of attention to the 
rudimentary details and directed to larger units of 
thought or action. In this way each new process and 
accomplishment must be mastered. We do not learn to 
read until our knowledge of letters and words has become 
automatic. We do not learn to speak correctly until our 
knowledge and application of the rules of grammar have 
become automatic. Nor do we learn to write until the
-P-A-G-E-199
GUIDING AND DIRECTING STUDY 183 
formation of letters has become automatic. Likewise 
right habits of thought and action must be established 
before an individual can be expected to do right and act 
right. Industry, self-control, and efficiency, as well as 
indolence and shiftlessness, are largely matters of habit. 
Every teacher should understand the main, important 
laws and principles underlying the formation of habits, 
and the technique involved in their application, in order 
that she may direct her pupils in the best methods of 
study and practice. 
The following are important factors to be kept in 
mind in drill work and habit formation: 
1. Habits may be initiated by precept or example, but 
must be fixed by drill, repetition, or practice. 
2. The best time to establish habits of right living 
and industry is during childhood and youth. 
3. It is generally as easy to form a right habit as a 
wrong one. 
4. In the acquisition of a new habit see that the pupil’s 
interest and determination are aroused. 
5. It is often during the early stages of repetition 
in drill work that it is most difficult to secure interest and 
sustained effort. Here careful guidance and encourage- 
ment are most necessary. 
6. Repetition should be conscious and at regular and 
frequent intervals. 
7. Make sure that repetition in drill work is identical. 
No exceptions, variations, and reversions should be 
allowed. 
8. See that every opportunity is given the pupil to 
act in accordance with the habit that is to be formed. 
9. See that the experience of repetition is made as
-P-A-G-E-200
  184 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
pleasurable and under as nearly natural conditions as 
possible. 
10. “In habits of thinking, secure accuracy first, speed 
later.” 
Memorizing—Memory work has been much criticized 
during recent years, but too often means and ends have 
been confused by short-sighted critics, who have criti- 
cized in general all memory work where they should have 
confined their criticisms to the methods and devices em- 
ployed in memorizing. 
Memory is all-important and plays a large part in our 
intellectual life. In fact it is quite impossible to think 
or reason without memory, or to separate memory from 
thinking and reasoning. Of what value could it be to 
learn a process, or to acquire knowledge of any kind, if 
it could not be retained or reproduced, and what would 
be left if memory were taken away? Judd, in his 
Psychology of High School Subjects, says: ‘Reasoning is 
the rearrangement and recombination of ideas. Reason- 
ing involves memory and classification of experiences and 
the combining of the experiences which belong together 
in leading to a definite conclusion.” According to James, 
“All the intellectual value for use of a state of mind de- 
pends on our after-memory of it.” 
It is highly important that a pupil’s powers of mem- 
ory and recall be developed, and that they be developed 
by the best methods and systems known; and this means 
that teachers must understand these methods and sys- 
tems. All exercises in memory work should be such 
as to keep the mind on the task, and to follow as closely 
as possible the laws of association and related ideas. 
There is always a tendency to fall into habits of memoriz-
-P-A-G-E-201
  
GUIDING AND DIRECTING STUDY 185 
ing with as little thinking as possible, and often without 
understanding. This should be guarded against. Mere 
memory-exercise work should not be overdone, and 
should not be allowed to become a substitute for think- 
ing. It is true that the fundamentals in elementary 
education are learned by drilling and memorizing that 
does not call for much thinking and reasoning, but even 
here comparisons, associations, and relationships are in- 
volved. McMurry says, “Impressions are not stored 
away in the brains, as an isolated state, or independently 
of one another. On the contrary, they are more or less 
intimately related as they are learned, and recall always 
takes place through association of some sort.’2 Mc- 
Murry quotes James as follows: “Whatever appears in 
the mind must be introduced; and, when introduced, it 
is as the associate of something already there.” 
From the preceding discussion the following rules may 
be deduced: 
1. Give close attention to and try to understand what 
you wish to remember. 
2. Connect or associate all new points to be remem- 
bered with something already familiar. In other words, 
“tie it, as it were, so that it will not float away.” If there 
are no obvious connections or associations invent some 
practical scheme. 
3. Repeat what you wish to remember, thoughtfully 
and with the intent to remember, until you are sure it has 
become well established. “Repetition is the mother of 
learning.” 
The notebook—Every pupil should be taught how to 
use a notebook advantageously. This is something that 
? How to Study and Teaching How to Study, p. 167.
-P-A-G-E-202
186 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
is sadly neglected in many of our schools. With proper 
directions in the taking of notes, the use of a notebook 
may be made very profitable and helpful, while without 
such directions its use may easily become a burden and 
a waste of time and energy which might better be spent 
in some other way. 
Generally speaking, it may be said that a minimum of 
writing should be required in study lessons. This should 
be in the form of outlines, synopses, and brief summaries 
of essentials. Nothing can be more burdensome and 
useless than to require pupils to write out many details 
of a topic or assignment for study purposes. In order 
to make outlines, synopses, and summaries intelligently 
and economically pupils need to be given definite in- 
structions and practice from time to time. By choosing 
simple and suitable material in which the main points 
stand out sufficiently clear, this work may well be intro- 
duced in the intermediate grades of the elementary 
school. In these grades progress may at first be slow, 
even with selected and limited material, and especially 
where organization work is required; but with proper 
directions and necessary help improvement will soon 
become noticeable. In the lower grades it is well to have 
pupils make a list, occasionally, of all the facts and con- 
clusions that they may find in the lesson. These may 
then be written on the blackboard where they may, with 
the help of the teacher, be classified and reduced to a 
smaller number of items. The teacher may also read to 
the class short, interesting articles for which the pupils 
may be required to write suitable headings or titles. As 
pupils become more mature they will gain in ability 
to classify and organize more difficult and extensive ma- 
 
-P-A-G-E-203
  GUIDING AND DIRECTING STUDY 187 
terial. They may then be required from time to time 
to write the substance of a paragraph in a single sen- 
tence, and to summarize the essentials of a chapter. 
These practices afford excellent training in the all- 
important work of classifying and organizing material. 
In taking notes at a lecture it is well to acquire the 
habit of using abbreviations or symbols. These should 
then be organized and written out more completely in 
the form of an outline as soon as possible after the 
lecture. 
For a notebook, properly kept, the following advan- 
tages may be claimed: 
1. It teaches pupils to classify and organize material. 
2. It teaches pupils to discriminate between essentials 
and non-essentials, and to evaluate material. 
8. It aids pupils in fixing the subject-matter in mind 
and in retaining it. 
4, It tends to develop good habits of study order, neat- 
ness, and promptness. 
. It is especially valuable for review purposes. 
. It serves as a reference or guide. 
. It encourages more intensive and thorough reading. 
. It sets a definite requirement for preparation. 
. It enables a teacher to check on the work of a pupil. 
10. It is a time-saver. 
Steps in studying—The steps to be taken in studying a 
given lesson will depend largely on the subject-matter, 
the aim, and the grade or ability of the class. The fol- 
lowing is taken from the Minnesota Course of Study and 
Manual for Teachers: “Of the steps in the process of 
studying there are many organizations, and each teacher 
must finally make his own, first, to fit all study; and, COONAN
-P-A-G-E-204
  188 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
“ second, to fit his particular grade. As a starting point, 
the following five steps are suggested, each to be briefly 
discussed later: (1) recognizing or setting the problem; 
(2) planning the solution; (3) solving the problem; 
(4) checking the results; and (5) applying the newly 
found knowledge to other situations. In general, steps 
(1) and (3) are the ones to be emphasized in primary 
grades, steps (2) and (4) the new steps to work on in 
intermediate grades, while in grammar grades, step (5) 
may be consciously added to the other four. 
1. “Before any real work can be done the performer 
must know toward what he is driving; or, in other words, 
must have a more or less specific aim, must see that there 
is a problem before him, must feel the need of overcom- 
ing some obstacle. . . . From first grade up, pupils must 
be helped to see their problems, only gradually learning 
to do that more difficult task, set their own problems; 
that is, not wait to be told what to do, but to ‘carry the 
message to Garcia’ without need of oversight. 
2. “The second step is to plan how to solve the prob- 
lem, to select the proper materials or tools and the best 
method of procedure to employ. This demands judg- 
ment of things, of worths, and of action. It demands 
memory, imagination, and organization. Thought must 
be supplemented by more thinking, by reading, or by 
asking other people’s opinions. 3 
38. “After the solution has been planned, the third step, 
doing the task, must be taken. Many find this the 
hardest step of all, for the actual doing of a planned task 
almost always involves drudgery, monotonous repetition, 
or mechanical detail. . . . It is here that teachers and 
parents need devices for holding children to their tasks
-P-A-G-E-205
  GUIDING AND DIRECTING STUDY 189 
without taking from them the real joy of having con- 
quered in spite of weariness or lack of interest. From 
the first grade on, pupils must be held to finishing work 
that is begun, though, of course, work given should fit 
the pupils’ ability to do... . 
4. “Having solved a problem, students need next to 
assure themselves that they are right. From having 
their work approved by others to being able to check it 
themselves is a long journey, but is a journey well worth 
conscious effort. To be able to check one’s own work, a 
person needs (a) to keep in mind his aim, (b) to know 
at least one other method of procedure, (c) to have a 
standard or ideal of what the result will be, and (d) be 
willing to do the work again, or have a pride in wanting 
to be certain of himself. Care, dispatch, and accuracy, 
are traits of character which this step will engender. 
5. “Having checked one’s self so that he feels sure of 
his knowledge, his sympathy, or his power to do, an indi- 
vidual is ready for the last step—using his freshly ac- 
quired ability or information under new circumstances.” ® 
The general study hall—In the general study hall 
where those pupils assemble who are not reciting, and 
where various groups are preparing their respective les- 
sons, it is quite impossible for the average teacher to 
help individual pupils with their problems or to direct 
them as to methods of attack and procedure. Unless 
the teacher is a good disciplinarian or the number of 
pupils in the room is small, her time is here usually taken 
up with various routine matters of general supervision 
of the room, so that she is unable to give any definite 
help even to those pupils of her own classes. Yet, in 
* Minnesota Course of Study and Manual for Teachers, pp. 283, 284.

190 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
  many of our schools, and especially in the smaller ones 
where it is difficult to arrange a daily program in such a 
way that teachers can meet with their respective classes 
during a study hour, this is the only provision made for 
directing the pupil’s study. Where the teacher’s daily 
program is not too heavy, it is, of course, possible, and 
advisable, to arrange for conferences and special help 
before and after regular school hours. But such confer- 
ence periods are not generally satisfactory unless they can 
be held during a time that pupils can be required to 
attend, for too often those who are most in need of 
special help are indifferent about attending or are unable 
to attend. 
Special provisions—Unless a part of the regular reci- 
tation period is devoted to directed study, arrangements 
should be made whereby a study period for each subject 
can be directed one or more times per week by the teacher 
of that subject. Where this cannot be done, a part of at 
least some of the recitation period should be devoted 
to carefully directed study, and occasionally one or more 
entire periods may well be devoted to this purpose. 
Where a single period is set aside for directed study or 
special help, it becomes necessary to assign certain sub- 
jects for different days of the week, or to give certain 
subjects preference on certain days. On Mondays, for 
example, the teacher of English (or the subject of Eng- 
lish) may have preference over other teachers. Pupils 
who have work to make up in English or who may need 
special help in this subject will then meet with their 
English teacher on Monday. Likewise history or history 
and social sciences may have preference on Tuesday. 
Supervised or directed study periods under any form
-P-A-G-E-207
  
GUIDING AND DIRECTING STUDY 191 
of organization or arrangement does not mean directed 
study unless the teacher in charge knows how to direct 
the pupils’ work. A skilful teacher may often accom- 
plish more in directing the pupils’ study during a few 
minutes of the recitation period than an unskilled teacher 
can accomplish with daily periods provided for that pur- 
pose. As was pointed out before, many teachers have 
had no instructions in teaching pupils how to study. It 
behooves a superintendent, therefore, to find out whether 
or not the teacher is making proper use of any time 
allotted for supervised or directed study, and to advise or 
direct her if necessary. 
The following suggestions and rules will be found 
helpful: 
Suggestions and Rules for Pupils 
1. Have a definite aim. 
2. See that conditions of light, heat, and ventilation 
are proper. 
8. Watch the posture of pupils and insist that they sit 
erect while studying. 
4, Try to make pupils feel the value and importance 
of what they learn. 
5. Teach pupils to observe closely and to recognize 
their problems. 
6. Work with pupils from time to time, going through 
the various steps necessary to prepare the lesson in the 
most intelligent and most economical way. This will 
depend on the nature of the lesson. 
7. Seek to discover the pupil’s method of study in order 
to suggest improvements or correct faulty methods.
-P-A-G-E-208
  192 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
8. Seek to direct pupils in the best methods of attack 
and procedure. 
9. Show pupils how to discriminate between essen- 
tials and non-essentials. 
10. Show pupils how to plan their solutions, to get a 
clear idea of what is to be done. 
11. Avoid any method that will tend to keep pupils 
from exercising their own best efforts. 
12. See that difficult problems and questions which 
involve thinking are started with well-defined aims. 
13. Avoid doing work for pupils which they can do 
for themselves with reasonable effort. This means that 
the teacher must exercise as much care in determining 
when not to help pupils as when to help them. 
14. Suggest methods of attack rather than to tell 
pupils just what to do. 
15. Seek to develop independence and self-reliance by 
requiring pupils to rely on themselves. 
16. Help pupils to classify and organize material. 
Importance of knowing how to study—An education 
is something that each one must acquire for himself. 
Knowledge and skill cannot be bought for money. They 
cannot be handed over a counter like a pair of shoes or 
transferred by endorsement like a note or check. It is 
evident, therefore, that no one can ever have more knowl- 
edge and skill than he acquired by his own efforts. Your 
teachers can help you only by supplying the material and 
by guiding and directing you in ways to acquire knowl- 
edge for yourself. It is greatly to your advantage, there- 
fore, to know how to study so that all your efforts will 
count. 
There is much waste of time and energy in studying
-P-A-G-E-209
  GUIDING AND DIRECTING STUDY 193 
and some pupils never learn how to study effectively. 
They are the ones who lose interest, become discouraged, 
and finally give up trying. 
Rules and study helps—The following suggestions and 
rules have been gleaned from various sources. Read 
and re-read them and apply them wherever you can. In 
this way you will soon acquire a study habit that will 
make your work easier and more effective. 
1, KEEP YOURSELF IN GOOD PHYSICAL CONDITION. 
a. Take proper and regular exercise. Without this 
both body and mind will become weary and sluggish. 
b. See that the room in which you sleep and work 
is well ventilated. Air affects not only the lungs but 
the brain. 
c. Be careful as to how and what you eat. Many of 
us eat too much. This makes us sluggish and dull, 
especially when we do not have enough physical or 
outdoor exercise. N SEE THAT CONDITIONS OF LIGHT, TEMPERATURE, 
CLOTHING, ETC., ARE FAVORABLE TO STUDY. 
a. In order to do effective work at home a quiet 
place is necessary. 
b. Sit erect when studying. 
ce. Don’t face a window or artificial light or sit too 
near a lamp or gas light. 
d. Don’t allow the temperature of the room to go 
above 70 degrees. 
e. Don’t wear clothing too tight around the waist, 
neck, and arms.

N. Dearborn, and the Scranton Pennsylvania Correspondence School.

  194 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
3. 
4, 
5. 2 oe FORM A PLACE-STUDY HABIT. 
Have a particular place, desk, or chair at school 
and at home where you study. Use this place only for 
studying (never to loaf) and you will soon find it to be 
the place where you can study best. 
FORM A TIME-STUDY HABIT. 
Carefully make a schedule of your time and follow 
it. By setting aside a definite period for studying a 
particular subject you are not likely to get behind in 
your work. 
BEGIN WORK PROMPTLY. 
a. Drill yourself to take on the attitude of attention 
and form the habit of getting to work at once. 
b. Launch yourself upon the task with as much im- 
petus as you can command. 
ce. The beginning is often the most difficult part of 
the lesson, and many pupils waste a great deal of time 
in getting started. Try to avoid this waste by reduc- 
ing your starting time to a minimum. 
WORK INTENSELY WHILE YOU WORK. 
a. By working intensely you can best comprehend 
and remember what you do. 
b. You will seldom remember what you do in an 
aimless or half-hearted way. 
c. After intense application for some time pause for 
a minute or two to rest your mind. Then continue in 
the same way. 
AVOID FLUSTER AND WORRY. 
a. Be careful not to let intense application become 
the kind of hurry and worry that defeats its own end.
-P-A-G-E-211
A GUIDING AND DIRECTING STUDY 195 
b. You may not be able to keep up with the best 
students in some respects, but that should not dis- 
courage you. Some can learn one thing more easily 
than others, and some another. 
ALWAYS DO YOUR WORK WITH THE INTENT TO 
LEARN AND REMEMBER. 
There must be a desire to know and to use what you 
study. Unless you study with the intent to remember 
and to make use of what you learn little good can come 
from your study. 
DON’T GIVE UP TOO EASILY. 
a. Don’t let the hard lesson discourage or overthrow 
you. 
b. Don’t ask for help in what you can do by yourself. 
Remember that if you can win out you have made a 
gain that will enable you to solve other similar tasks 
with: less difficulty. 
10. BEFORE BEGINNING THE ADVANCED WORK RE- 
11. VIEW RAPIDLY THE PREVIOUS LESSON. 
a. This rapid review will help you greatly to remem- 
ber the previous lessons, especially if the subject- 
matter has points of contact with the new material. 
b. Such a review will also often clear up matters 
which you may not have understood thoroughly. 
MAKE A RAPID PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF THE 
ASSIGNED LESSON. 
a. By a rapid and rough preliminary survey of the 
new lesson you will better understand the purpose, 
ends, and aims to keep in mind while preparing the 
lesson. 
 
-P-A-G-E-212
  196 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
b. Such a survey will enable you to read for a pur- 
pose and to better understand what you are reading. 
12. FORM THE HABIT OF REVIEWING MENTALLY A 
PARAGRAPH OR SECTION AS SOON AS YOU HAVE 
READ IT. 
a. Read and reread a sentence or paragraph until 
you understand it, rather than to read and reread the 
entire lesson. 
b. Make sure that you can recall the main thought 
before going on. 
c. The learning of important matters should always 
be carried beyond the point of immediate recall. 
13. MEMORIZING. 
a. In committing to memory such material as defini- 
tions of technical terms, formulas, dates, and outlines 
try to associate these with something already known. 
If you cannot do this invent some practical artificial 
scheme for recalling the material. 
b. The best way to master material that is at all 
extensive or complex is to make an outline or synopsis 
of it. If material is to be retained permanently commit 
the outline to memory. Visualize it. 
14. LEARN TO READ RAPIDLY. 
a. It is easier to understand when reading rapidly 
than when reading slowly. 
b. It is better to read aloud what you are commit- 
ting to memory, where this can be done. 
15. NOTE TAKING. 
a. Learn to take notes economically by using a sys- 
tem of abbreviations, symbols, and catchwords.
-P-A-G-E-213
  
GUIDING AND DIRECTING STUDY 197 
b. Notes taken rapidly should be rewritten as soon 
as possible or amplified into a more complete outline. 
16. APPLICATION. 
a. “In all your work apply your knowledge as much 
as possible and as soon as possible.” 
b. There is no better way to remember a thing than 
to tell some one about it or to do something with it.

CHAPTER XII 
THE GRADING AND PROMOTION OF PUPILS 
There is now considerable literature available on the 
grading and promotion of pupils. Many plans and 
schemes have been advocated and tried, and it may be 
said that they all have something to commend them; 
but the greater part of all that has been written in this 
field is applicable only to larger school systems, where 
there are several classes of the same grade. This fact 
has been so generally overlooked by those who have 
written on the subject, and by others who in turn have 
taught their plans and theories to young people, that 
many a one has been misled with respect to the prac- 
ticability of adopting these devices and schemes in 
smaller school systems. 
The first thing that the administrator of a small school 
system should clearly understand is that economy cannot 
be disregarded; and that, generally, the more refined the 
system of gradirg and classifying the greater will be the 
number of divisions and the more costly it will be. 
It may be said, too, that the success of any plan or 
scheme will depend in a large measure on the spirit in 
which it is undertaken; and that the first important step 
on the part of a superintendent of a smaller school sys- 
tem is to see that the teachers become conscious of the 
existence of individual differences among pupils, and duly 
198
-P-A-G-E-215
  THE GRADING AND PROMOTION OF PUPILS 199 
appreciative of the needs of making provision to meet 
these differences. 
Solution of problems varies with size of school—In 
those school systems where there are several classes in 
each grade and several teachers for each grade it is pos- 
sible to make various groupings and classifications; but 
in three out of every four graded school systems in the 
United States where there is only one teacher to one or 
more grades this cannot be done. Here the problems are 
different and must be solved by different methods. 
In smaller systems, generally, the best that can be done 
at our present state of educational development is to 
classify pupils into grades and promote them by grades 
annually. And this method is not so bad as some alarm- 
ists would have us believe. By dividing the pupils of a 
grade in certain subjects into two classes or sections— 
where this seems advisable or necessary—it is usually 
possible to keep them all busy, and yet keep the grade 
as a whole together till the end of the year. With a 
well-planned course of study and with fair supervision, 
a teacher of average ability should be able to find in the 
regular work outlined for a given grade sufficient material 
to be used as a central core with which to hold the pupils 
of her grade together for a year, and to find enough sup- 
plemental or additional material to keep all pupils busy 
at something worth while. There are many ways in 
which backward pupils can be helped to make progress 
and in which bright pupils can do additional work, with 
a little individual attention on the part of the teacher; 
and in many instances this method entails less additional 
work on the part of the teacher than added divisions or 
more frequent reclassification. This, too, is something 
 
-P-A-G-E-216
  
200 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
which the advocates of highly refined methods of classi- 
fication have frequently overlooked. 
Whenever it is possible the daily program should be 
so planned that there will be one period each day during 
which no classes recite, and during which the teacher may 
help backward pupils and those who need special atten- 
tion. This is generally preferable to having pupils kept 
after school for help. All individual help, however, 
should be given with a view to teach pupils how to study 
rather than to help them prepare a given lesson. 
Semi-annual promotions—Where the school system is 
large enough to employ one or more teachers for each 
grade, a semi-annual promotion plan can be carried out 
by keeping the pupils of a grade divided into two sec- 
tions, with one section a half year in advance of the other. 
In this way the teacher may have two classes from the 
first of the year, and at the end of each semester all pupils 
who are doing satisfactory work are promoted. The 
more capable pupils can then be grouped together and 
given additional work, while those who fail of promotion 
will need to repeat only one semester’s work. The plan 
also, as a rule, carries with it the idea of special promo- 
tions of individual pupils. It does not follow, however, 
that under such a plan all advance pupils must change 
rooms at the end of the first semester; but whenever a 
pupil or group of pupils have done a sufficient amount of 
additional or advance work in their grade or room, they 
may begin work in the next room with the advanced 
group and thereby gain a half year in time. 
Such a plan has both its advantages and disadvantages. 
It enables some pupils to go through the grades in less 
time, but it generally means more recitations for the
-P-A-G-E-217
  THE GRADING AND PROMOTION OF PUPILS 201 
teacher, and consequently less time for individual help. 
The plan requires also that the course of study be so 
planned that the more capable pupils can get the extra 
work necessary for their advancement. Unless there are 
thirty or more pupils in each of several consecutive grades 
the advisability of carrying out this plan is questionable. 
Vacation classes—Summer vacation classes are an- 
other means for enabling pupils who have become re- 
tarded to make up back work and pass on to the next 
grade with their classmates. In small school systems this 
is often the most practicable solution for taking care of 
these children. Where it can be shown that there are 
enough pupils retarded in their work to justify the ex- 
penditure of maintaining one or more classes for a num- 
ber of weeks during the summer, the board of education 
can usually be induced to make the necessary provisions. 
The cost of maintaining classes during the summer is less 
than during the winter; the building and equipment are 
there and the only additional outlay is that of salary for 
teachers. It may be said, too, that when it is understood 
that in this way a larger percentage of pupils can be 
promoted each year and that a larger percentage will 
pass through the grades into the high school each year, 
the necessary outlay becomes an economy rather than an 
expense. Where the board is unwilling to employ teach- 
ers for this purpose at the expense of the general public, 
a reasonable rate of tuition can be charged and paid by 
the parents of the children attending. Parents are 
usually willing and anxious to pay this tuition in order 
that their children may have an opportunity to make up 
any back work, and pass on to the next grade with their 
classmates. It is possible, too, as a rule, to find a teacher 
 
-P-A-G-E-218
  202 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
who can take care of the backward pupils from two or 
more grades, and who is glad to have the work. The 
writer has tried this plan with very good results. 
Parents, generally, as well as teachers, are interested in 
the progress of children and anxious to have them pass 
on to the next grade. 
Where the plan of summer-school work is contem- 
plated, it is important that the individual needs of re- 
tarded pupils be carefully determined and reported in 
writing by the regular teachers at the end of the school 
year. In this way only can the work be so planned as 
to meet the needs of those for whom it is intended. Care 
must be exercised not to offer at this time regular work 
that is yet to be covered by the other members of the 
grade or class, unless provisions can be made later for 
those pupils who have already had the work, or that 
they can do enough work in this way to justify their 
skipping a year’s work, or a half year’s work in case of 
semi-annual promotions. 
Basis for promotion—In order to maintain a uniform 
and proper standard for classification and promotions it 
is necessary to adopt some established or well-worked-out 
plan or scheme as a basis. In primary grades promotion 
is usually based chiefly on the pupil’s general ability to 
do the work in the following grade. In the upper grades 
and high school it is quite commonly based on a mini- 
mum percentage, which is determined from the pupil’s 
class-record rating and his periodical or term examina- 
tions. The relative value of these are fixed according to 
some arbitrary ratio. Frequently the class record counts 
two-thirds while the examinations count one-third. In 
some schools intelligence tests are now used in place of
-P-A-G-E-219
  THE GRADING AND PROMOTION OF PUPILS 203 
or in addition to regular examinations. Of these tests 
more will be said in a later chapter. 
In the grades, where the work is not departmentalized, 
pupils have generally been required to reach a minimum 
percentage in all the main subjects before being allowed 
to enter the next grade. The injustice of this has become 
very evident in recent years; and it is now quite com- 
monly held by leading educators that a pupil who has 
failed to make a passing grade in one or two subjects 
should not be required to repeat the entire year’s work. 
Many now hold that promotion should be governed by 
what a pupil can do as well as by what he has done. 
Where a pupil has failed to make a passing grade because 
of irregular attendance or sickness, and where it seems 
probable that he will be able to overcome the deficiency 
and make up any back work that may be necessary in 
order to do the work in the next grade, he should be pro- 
moted even if he has failed to reach the required per- 
centage in two subjects. 
In intermediate schools and high schools where the 
work is departmentalized, the matter of promotion is 
comparatively simple, since here pupils are given credit 
for their work by subjects and a failure in one or more 
subjects does not necessitate repeating the work in other 
subjects. 
Promoting deficient or retarded pupils—There is a 
growing conviction that no pupil should remain in a 
given grade more than two years, and that where no 
special provisions can be made for deficient and retarded 
children they should be promoted every second year re- 
gardless of their past work or whether they are ready for 
the work in the next grade. It is held that such children 
 
-P-A-G-E-220
  204 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
should be kept with others of appro:.imately their own 
age in order that they may not be denied the daily con- 
tact and association with them. This mingling with 
other children of their own age is all-important especially 
to those who are deficient or retarded. From their asso- 
ciation and intermingling with other pupils such children 
often gain more than from their recitations. It is some- 
thing of which they should not be deprived, even to the 
detriment of their prescribed school work.

  CHAPTER XIIT 
PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN DISCIPLINE 
Meaning and aim of discipline—The word “discipline” 
is used in this chapter in the sense in which it is com- 
monly employed in referring to school government and 
classroom management. 
Changing conceptions of education and of the nature 
of the teacher’s work have brought about marked changes 
in our ideals of what constitutes good discipline. In the 
better schools of today the problem of obedience and 
methods of punishment are no longer of first importance. 
A well-disciplined school is no longer one that is char- 
acterized by the subservience of a group of pupils to the 
will of the teacher, or by the strict obedience of the pupils 
to her commands. Modern methods of school discipline 
seek to control and guide pupils without coercion or 
force; to bring about good order and conduct by indirect 
methods and positive incentives, rather than by com- 
pulsion or fear of punishment. Control and restriction 
and a measure of arbitrary dominance on the part of 
the teacher will probably always be necessary because 
of the immaturity of children; and while the immediate 
purpose of these may often be repression or constraint, 
their ultimate aim is freedom. 
Good discipline a matter of exact knowledge—Some 
educators hold that good and poor discipline go hand in 
205 
 
-P-A-G-E-222

hand with good and poor instruction, that if the instruc- 
tional skill is kept at a high level, and that if pupils are 
kept interested and busy, the discipline will take care 
of itself. It is true that school discipline cannot be sepa- 
rated from other school work; and it is probably also true 
that the teacher’s spirit, instructional skill, personality 
and influence are more important factors in discipline 
than are her authority and rule. But the fact remains that 
ability to discipline is a matter of exact knowledge and 
its application. Teachers who understand their subject- 
matter thoroughly and who are competent in instruc- 
tional skill are often poor disciplinarians, Certain teach- 
ers, for example, not infrequently obtain good results in 
classroom work but are unable to keep proper order in an 
assembly room or on the playground; others are good 
disciplinarians but poor instructors. Again it may be 
said that some teachers are successful in their discipline 
with little children but are unable to keep order with 
older pupils, and vice versa. 
Ability to discipline is not a natural gift, but the result 
of careful planning and systematization; ability to esti- 
mate the importance of little things; and “the exact 
performance of duty at the right time and in the right 
way.” 
Importance of definite rules and regulations—Too 
much detailed regulation and restriction is oppressing 
and dispiriting, and prevents or restricts the development 
of those qualities that are most necessary and useful; 
namely, self-control and ability to carry responsibility. 
The fact remains, however, that without good order and 
conduct good results cannot be obtained in school work, 
and that it is easier to maintain good order and conduct
-P-A-G-E-223
  PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN DISCIPLINE 207 
by having definite regulations and limitations prescribed 
than to allow individual teachers and pupils to exercise 
their own judgment concerning the matter. Such a 
method does not necessarily mean oppression or restric- 
tion of the pupils’ rights. It is true, too, that many 
teachers do not need definite directions in order to main- 
tain good order and conduct, but many others do, and 
for their sake directions should be prescribed, and should 
be observed by all if good results are to be obtained. 
Bagley, in his Classroom Management, emphasizes the 
importance of “initiating immediately upon the organiza- 
tion of a school or a class the little specific habits that will 
take care of routine matters.” Speaking of the causes 
of an unruly school, in his School Discipline, he says, 
“Mechanized routine is among the most important of 
the conditions to be listed here. Disorder and confusion 
will inevitably grow upon themselves, and in the absence 
of simple rules for the performance of routine tasks, 
duties, and movements, disorder and confusion are inevi- 
table. If each pupil knows at the outset just what he 
is to do as a matter of routine and how he is to do it, 
many difficulties, otherwise serious, will be easily 
avoided.” + 
To quote Colgrove, “Good order is best secured by 
reducing the necessary routine of the school to a habit, by 
making it automatic, by looking carefully after the ‘little 
things,’ such as the distribution and use of materials, 
sharpening pencils, care of desks, helping individual 
pupils, requests to leave the room, to whisper, or to get 
a drink, passing through the halls. In short, good order 
is secured through managing rather than governing. 
*W. C. Bagley, School Discipline, Chapter III, p. 46.
-P-A-G-E-224
    208 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
Regular employment of activity, systematized and con- 
stant occupation, and the influence of the teacher are the 
real secrets of success in the government of the school.” ? 
Inspector Hughes of Toronto, according to an abstract 
given by Colgrove, points out that disorder in school is 
created by teachers whose standard of order is low; who 
think it “easiest to keep poor order,” and who think 
children like disorder; who think that power to discipline 
is a natural gift, and who try to stop disorder by ringing 
a bell, striking the desk, or stamping the floor; who are 
themselves noisy, speak in a high key, and roll their eyes, 
but do not see; who do not see the use of being so par- 
ticular about trifles. 
Many failures due to poor discipline—In a statistical 
study * made by the writer of “Why Teachers Fail,” it 
was found that of sixteen characteristics or qualities 
enumerated, “Lack of ability to discipline (governing 
skill),” was held to be the most frequent cause of failure, 
according to the combined judgment of 420 superinten- 
dents and 183 presidents of school boards. These char- 
acteristics are considered in Chapter IV, under “Factors 
to be Considered in the Selection of Teachers.” 
Instructing the teacher—A school administrator 
should see to it that beginning teachers and others who 
may have trouble with discipline are definitely instructed 
as to the importance of various fundamentals and preven- 
tive measures to be observed from the beginning. He 
should assist a teacher who is weak in discipline by help- 
ing her to make an analysis of the causes and of herself. 
If he understands the underlying principles of good disci-

PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN DISCIPLINE 209 
pline and has a fair knowledge of human nature he will, 
as a rule, be able to analyze a situation and help the 
teacher to improve upon her methods. 
J The following suggestions will be found helpful: 
1. Standards should be set the first day—The time to 
set the standards for good discipline is the first day of 
school. It follows from this that beginning teachers and 
those who are likely to have trouble with discipline 
should be instructed beforehand as to necessary precau- 
tions and preventive measures, and the importance of 
poomive the utmost care from the beginning. 
2. Be sympathetic and kind but firm and insistent. 
A teacher who is sympathetic and kind but firm and in- 
sistent on respectful obedience and good conduct from 
the beginning, who can convince pupils that she means 
what she says, and who will not tolerate exceptions to her 
rules, will have little trouble with discipline. Pupils 
generally will not only obey but will admire such a 
Sena 
8. Good discipline a matter of habit formation. 
Teachers should understand that respect, obedience, good 
order and conduct are largely matters of habit, that it is 
as easy to form good habits as bad ones, and that it is 
heir duty to see that good habits are formed. 
4. Signals and system for entering and leaving rooms. 
In order to maintain good order and conduct there must 
be definite signals and a definite system for entering and 
leaving all rooms. These should be strictly observed by 
all. The teacher should always be in the room when 
pupils arrive, and should not allow them to rush pell- 
mell into the room, to run in the room, scramble for cer- 
tain seats, shout, or throw missiles. This does not, on
-P-A-G-E-226
210 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
the other hand, mean that pupils should always go in 
rigid lines or according to military precision. 
5. Seating of pupils. Pupils should not be allowed to 
select their own seats but should be assigned to certain 
seats during the first regular session of the school year. 
In making this first assignment the teacher should exer- 
cise her best judgment in placing those pupils who are 
known to be or who seem likely to be mischievous where 
they can do the least harm. She should then carefully 
observe the conduct of all, and as soon as it becomes evi- 
dent that any two or more are inclined to visit or become 
mischievous they should be required to change their 
seats. It is usually well for a teacher to assign the first 
one or two who become mischievous to seats near her 
desk or away from the other pupils. There should never 
be more than one pupil in a seat, even during a recitation 
period, if it can be avoided. 
6. Conduct of pupils during recesses. Teachers should 
not make a practice of leaving their pupils without over- 
sight or general supervision during recesses. It is often 
difficult to get some teachers to see the importance of 
this. Many a teacher loses control over her pupils in her 
room because she does not concern herself about their 
conduct during the recess period, or does not insist on 
proper conduct during this time. In bad weather when 
pupils are obliged to remain in the room they should 
never be allowed to become loud and boisterous, and 
should not be left without someone in charge. 
7. Position of teacher with reference to pupils. The 
teacher should be before the class during the recitation. 
If the class is large and the teacher inexperienced, she 
may find that it is easier to command good attention by
-P-A-G-E-227
  PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN DISCIPLINE 211 
standing during the recitation. She should not, how- 
ever, overtax her strength by attempting to stand during 
all recitations. A high chair that will enable the teacher 
to see all her pupils clearly is a distinct advantage in 
conducting a recitation while sitting, especially if the 
class is large. 
It is usually easier to keep order in a study room or 
assembly room by remaining in the rear of the room. 
This places mischievous pupils at a disadvantage to 
know whether or not the teacher is watching them. 
A teacher should always avoid, as far as possible, turn- 
ing her back to the pupils. She should not go to the 
desk of an individual pupil and stoop over to help him, 
with her back turned to a considerable number of other 
pupils. The moral effect of this is as a rule decidedly 
bad. This principle also applies to a teacher on hall 
duty or while pupils are passing between classes. Inex- 
perienced teachers are apt to allow an individual pupil 
to engage their attention in conversation so completely 
that they forget for the time being their supervisory 
duty. Some superintendents do not allow pupils to ask 
questions while passing between classes or through the 
corridors. 
U8. Leaving the room. A teacher should not make a 
practice of leaving her room now and then during school 
hours, if only for a few minutes. Nothing will con- 
tribute more to disorder and misconduct. If it becomes 
necessary to leave the room, it is well to have some well- 
behaved pupil placed in charge of the room while the 
teacher is gone. 
Pupils should never be permitted to leave the room 
without permission. The privilege of leaving the room
-P-A-G-E-228
    212 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
cannot be entirely forbidden, but must be carefully 
guarded and restricted. If this is not done some pupils 
will always take undue advantage. The teacher must 
watch and study those individuals who are inclined to 
abuse the privilege of leaving the room and prescribe 
some form of punishment to check the evil. Often it 
can be checked by keeping a record of the time lost and 
requiring that the greater part of this time be made up 
after school. 
9. Whispering or communicating without permission. 
A teacher who will allow pupils to whisper or communi- 
cate without permission during the school session is sure 
to have trouble with discipline sooner or later. Some 
teachers will contend that it is impossible to prevent this 
altogether and will use such statements as an excuse for 
allowing or tolerating some of it. Often they do not 
appreciate what exceptions mean to the establishment of 
a rule, or do not understand the law of habit formation— 
to allow no exceptions or deviations from a rule or 
method. Communication, if tolerated, soon leads to 
many other forms of misconduct, and it is safe to say that 
the more whispering and communication a teacher toler- 
ates the greater will be her problem in limiting or con- 
trolling it. 
10. Passing supplies, materials, and waste basket. In 
order to avoid unnecessary confusion, noise and detrac- 
tion, as well as for the sake of economy, there should be a 
definite system for the passing and collecting of supplies, 
and materials, disposing of waste paper, ete. 
The collecting and distributing of inkbottles, paper, 
and other materials may be done by pupils in the front 
or rear seats of each row. In the grade rooms waste
-P-A-G-E-229
  
PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN DISCIPLINE 213 
baskets should be passed at stated intervals by certain 
pupils in order that all may dispose of waste paper and 
other waste material that may have accumulated. 
Pupils should not be allowed to leave their seats in order 
to deposit waste paper in the basket. In the high school 
waste baskets may be placed near doors and other places 
where pupils pass. Every pupil should be held responsi- 
ble for the condition of the floor underneath and around 
his desk. It is not a difficult matter to keep the floor 
reasonably clean if the teacher will insist on this from 
the beginning. 
11. Borrowing pencils, adjusting windows, shades, etc. 
The teacher should restrict or forbid the borrowing of 
pencils, knives, etc. from other pupils. In the lower 
grades it is well for the teacher to keep a supply of pen- 
cils at her desk to be loaned when necessary. Ordinarily 
pupils should not be allowed to raise or lower windows 
and window shades, or to adjust ventilating or heating 
systems without permission. 
12. Scolding, disputes, and arguments. A teacher 
should not resort to general scolding, enter into a dispute 
or argument with a pupil, lose control of herself, or do 
anything that will unnecessarily divert the attention of 
the entire room. She should not call out over the heads 
of other pupils to reprimand or advise an individual 
pupil. 
13. Original tendencies. It is sometimes easy for a 
teacher to misunderstand the attitude of certain children 
or to misjudge their conduct, especially where they have 
not had the advantage of good home training. We are 
apt to forget that children often possess inherited ten- 
dencies that must be curbed or redirected through train- 
 
-P-A-G-E-230
  214 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
ing. A desire to explore, collect, and manipulate objects; 
group rivalry; teasing; tormenting; bullying; and fight- 
ing are all based on original and instinctive tendencies, 
some of which in the case of certain individuals are very 
strong. Naturally children will respond and react to 
certain situations in accordance with these tendencies 
until they have been trained to do otherwise. A skilful 
teacher will seek to utilize those tendencies that can be 
directed to bring about desired results, and to modify 
and redirect those that cannot be so directed. In the 
words of Thorndike, “The task of education is to make 
the best use of the original tendencies, eradicating their 
vicious elements, wasting the least possible of value that 
nature gives, and supplying at the most useful time the 
additions that are needed to improve and satisfy wants.” 
Good manners, good conduct, and good habits should, 
of course, be taught in the lower grades, but where they 
have not been taught in these grades the teaching of 
them should not be neglected even in high school. 
14. Wrong home influences. Some older pupils seem 
to be naturally disobedient and mischievous, and will not 
behave or apply themselves to their work unless they are 
strictly required to do so. Usually, it is safe to say, they 
have not been brought up properly, and have perverted 
notions and ideas. The attitude and conduct of such 
pupils can often be improved by tactful and intelligent 
codperation with the parents. A good teacher will study 
the attitude, disposition, and temperament of every pupil 
in her room or class. She will endeavor to find out what 
she can about the pupil’s home influences and environ- 
ment, advantages and disadvantages, and will utilize this 
information to the best advantage possible.

HONOR SOCIETIES AND MERIT SYSTEMS 
Honor societies and well-worked-out schemes of Serv- 
ice Credits, Citizenship Rating, etc. are helpful means 
for promoting scholarship and good conduct. 
Eligibility for membership in an honor society may 
be determined each quarter or semester by the attain- 
ment of a certain number of points in scholarship, stu- 
dent activities, etc., as judged by the principal and a 
scholarship committee. 
The following system of merits and demerits, given 
under “Citizenship Rating,” is taken from the Santa Ana 
Senior High School Manual (1924-1925), Santa Ana, 
California: 
1. MERITS 
1. At the beginning of each semester every student will 
be given a clean record of 100 merits. 
2. A perfect class attendance record for any semester 
will entitle the student to 10 additional merits which may 
be applied to any previous semester’s record. 
8. No tardiness during the semester will entitle the 
student to 5 additional merits which may be applied to 
any previous semester’s record. 
4, At the end of each semester, all merits that a pupil 
has above 90 may be applied to any previous semester’s 
record. 
2. DEMERITS 
V 1. Tardiness. Each offense, when unexcused—1 de- 
merit. 
2. Cutting class, study hall, gym, or assembly—4 
demerits.  
-P-A-G-E-232
  216 A MANUAL FOR, CHOOL OFFICERS 
3. Any misconduct in classroom, study hall, library, 
or assembly, such as chewing gum, unwarranted whisper- 
ing, unnecessary disturbance, etc.—2 demerits. 
In case offense is in assembly student shall be excused 
from assembly the balance of that semester. 
4, Any misconduct in halls, such as running, yelling, 
whistling, crowding so as to obstruct passage, leaving 
papers or other debris on the floor, being in halls during 
class time without transfer slip, ete—2 demerits. 
5. Leaving lunch papers on the lawns—2 demerits. 
\. 6. Profanity—5 demerits. 
7. Stealing, cheating, lying, or forgery—10 to 25 
demerits. 
8. Defacing, or in any way tampering with school 
property—10 demerits. 
9. The state law pore that smoking is an offense 
punishable by suspension. On reinstatement, the stu- 
dent shall be given demerits at the discretion of the 
Principal. 
10. For any obvious misconduct not listed above, 
whether occurring in classroom, halls, or on the school 
grounds, or away from the grounds when the pupils are 
representing the school in any capacity a teacher may 
recommend as high as 5 demerits. 
In the above school, if a student’s citizenship rating 
falls below a certain standard he forfeits certain rights 
and is denied certain privileges, such as participation in 
athletics and other student activities. The students 
themselves take an active part in administering the 
rewards and punishments outlined in this rating 
scheme.

11. Avoid as far as possible turning your back to a 
number of pupils in the room. 
12. Do not allow a pupil to engage your attention so 
completely that you forget your responsibility to other 
pupils.

recitation without permission, or to interrupt anyone who 
is speaking. 
19. Restrict the borrowing of pencils, knives, etc. 
20. Do not allow pupils to adjust windows, shades, etc. 
without permission. 
Note. If there are no printed directions in the school covering 
the essential points in discipline it is well to have typewritten or 
mimeographed copies made of a limited number of directions to be 
handed to beginning teachers and others who may have trouble with 
discipline.

  CHAPTER XIV 
THE RECITATION 
The best method of procedure in conducting a given 
recitation will depend in a large measure on the lesson 
assignment, which in turn is determined largely by the 
subject-matter or nature of the work, and by the grade 
or the ability of the class. The recitation may therefore 
assume any one of a multitude of different forms. Vari- 
ous fundamental principles and characteristics, however, 
apply more or less directly to all recitations. Some of 
the more important of these will be treated in this 
chapter. 
Plan or purpose—It may be said first that every reci- 
tation should have a definite plan or purpose, which 
should be in the teacher’s mind when the lesson assign- 
ment is made. Without a definite plan it is difficult to 
conduct or develop the work of the recitation in proper 
order and sequence, to keep certain pupils from roam- 
ing too far afield, and to keep the efforts of the class 
focused toward the purpose or goal to be reached. Inex- 
perienced teachers, especially, are often in danger of los- 
ing their way, or being sidetracked by pupils who will 
seek to hide their lack of preparation by evasive answers, 
or questions. Where a recitation plan is followed it will, 
as a rule, soon become known to the pupils and will tend 
to keep them from wandering during the preparation of 
their lessons.

220 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
Order and attention—A teacher should insist on good 
order and attention during the recitation period. With- 
out this good results cannot be obtained. Pupils who 
are mischievous, ill-mannered, indifferent, or who will 
try to shirk and evade definite answers, should be re- 
quired from the beginning to conduct themselves respect- 
fully. They should be held strictly to the questions 
asked or the work assigned, and should always be re- 
quired to make a fair effort. Such pupils should not be 
allowed to sit in seats or stand at the blackboard where 
they can communicate with one another during the reci- 
tation. All pupils should have permanent seats. They 
should be required to sit up straight in their seats, and 
to look up and speak up when questioned. On the other 
hand, care should be exercised to keep the class in good 
spirit and not to discourage expression or active partici- 
pation on the part of all pupils. 
Have pupils stand up and speak up—In the lower 
grades, generally, and in at least some of the recitations 
in high school, teachers should require that pupils stand 
erect in a dignified manner while reciting. They should 
be taught to stand up, look up, and speak up, so that the 
entire class can hear what they say. In case of more 
lengthy recitations or reports they should be required to 
come forward and face the class. No one should be ex- 
cused except for physical reasons, but all should be re- 
quired to make an effort. Where pupils have not been 
taught to do this in the grades they frequently find it 
difficult to do so in high school. It is training that is 
sadly needed even by most high school pupils. To be 
unable to speak to a group of persons in a creditable 
manner and without becoming embarrassed is often a

  great disadvantage or handicap in after life; and if we 
do not teach pupils to do this in school, where can we 
expect them to learn how? 
Poise and attitude of teacher—The teacher should 
strive to stand and sit erect in a calm and dignified man- 
ner before her class. She should at all times give the 
impression that she is interested in the lesson and in the 
recitations of the pupils. For a teacher to sit back 
lazily in her chair at a distance from the class while a 
member is reciting, or to walk the floor nervously while 
conducting the recitation, is poor pedagogy. She should 
know also that to lecture before a class in an entertaining 
manner is not as a rule conducive to good hard thinking 
on the part of the pupils. 
Keeping all busy—The teacher should strive to keep 
all pupils busy during the recitation period. To do this 
is not always an easy matter, but it is usually a fair index 
to the teacher’s ability to plan and conduct a recitation. 
It means, generally, that she herself must show proper 
animation and enthusiasm; that she must test different 
pupils frequently on their attention to questions asked; 
and that she must hold all accountable for corrections of 
mistakes made by pupils reciting, as well as for sugges- 
tions and knowledge of what has been brought out in 
each recitation. 
Recitation dominates method of study—If the assign- 
ment is carefully made and the recitation is conducted 
accordingly, pupils will soon know just what is required 
of them during the recitation and will prepare them- 
selves to meet this requirement. In this way both the 
assignment and the recitation can be made to govern to 
a large extent the pupil’s method of study. There is a
-P-A-G-E-238
    222 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
direct relation between the method of teaching employed 
by the teacher and the method of study employed by the 
pupils. Speaking of the recitation, McMurry says, “How 
children study in preparation for the recitation will de- 
pend upon how the recitation itself is conducted, upon 
what is first called for there and what is most emphasized. 
. . . The questions that are considered in the recitation 
are the factor of greatest influence. If the children find 
that the teacher’s questions usually begin with what, or 
where, or when, thereby merely calling for direct repro- 
duction of the substance of text, she may talk ever so 
much about right methods of study, but they will mem- 
orize before thinking and without thinking.” * 
Listening—One of the first and most important things 
to be accomplished in the primary grades is to teach chil- 
dren to listen. And if they have not been taught to 
listen carefully, this should be the first consideration in 
any grade. The teacher’s ability to speak distinctly, co- 
herently, and interestingly has much to do with teaching 
children to listen. Small children are at first quite un- 
able to exercise voluntary attention, even for short inter- 
vals at a time. But by changing their work frequently, 
and testing their attention on what is said and done, they 
may be taught to listen consciously, and will soon show 
improvement in ability to give and hold attention. The 
following is quoted from the Minnesota Course of Study: 
“Listening, at first involuntary, becomes voluntary as the 
power of attention is trained. From giving voluntary 
attention for very short periods in the first grade, pupils 
grow in power to attend for longer and longer periods. 
Teachers should make sure that children are gaining in 
7F, M. McMurry, How to Study, pp. 187, 188.
-P-A-G-E-239
THE RECITATION 223 
ability to attend, for this power is the basis of will, and 
a controlled will is the foundation of character (highest 
self-realization).” 
Many teachers, as well as older students, have never 
learned the art of listening. Often they are the ones 
who most pride themselves on their ability to talk flu- 
ently. They do not realize that they belong to that 
class of people whose ability to talk is often a liability 
rather than an asset, since it interferes with their effort 
and need to obtain more exact knowledge and under- 
standing of the things about which they talk. Much of 
what we learn in this world we learn through our associa- 
tion with others, and in the degree that we listen well we 
learn well. 
Questioning—Good questioning is an art required only 
by study and practice. Every teacher should strive to 
make herself as proficient as possible in questioning. By 
skilful questioning the teacher is able to verify the result 
of her teaching as well as the preparation and under- 
standing of her pupils. The amount of questioning to 
be done and the type of questions to be asked will vary 
greatly with the subject-matter, the grade or class, and 
the teacher’s aim or purpose. The main questions of a 
recitation should always be planned. A _ beginning 
teacher will find it helpful to write out a list of care- 
fully studied questions from time to time. Much de- 
pends upon the enthusiasm that a teacher can put into 
the lesson, the novelty of the question, and the way it is 
put. 
The following requisites of good questioning should be 
understood by all teachers: 
1. The method of questioning should be such that it
-P-A-G-E-240
    
224 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
will make the class as a whole think. To accomplish this 
the questions should usually be directed to the entire 
class rather than to an individual. 
2. When a question has been asked a reasonable 
amount of time should be allowed before calling upon 
anyone to recite. If a pupil’s name is called before the 
question is stated, or before the various members of the 
class have had time to reflect or recall the answer, some 
pupils will fail to follow the recitation. 
8. Questions should be clear and definite and should 
be so worded that they can be understood by all who have 
made a reasonable preparation of the subject-matter 
under consideration. All questions should be adapted to 
previous experiences and work of the class. 
4. All questions should be so stated that they will en- 
courage expression. They should, whenever possible be 
the focus of expressions of large rather than small units 
of work, calling for extended answers. 
5. The questions should, as far as possible, be such as 
to carry the thought forward in logical relationship or 
order of dependence. 
6. The teacher should make sure that the pupils grasp 
or understand the topic or subject-matter as a whole and 
do not merely memorize isolated or disconnected facts. 
7. Memory questions should, whenever possible, be 
used as the beginning of a thought to be carried forward 
or amplified. 
8. Questions should be so stated that they will not 
reveal the answer or encourage guesswork. 
9. A teacher should not fall into the habit of repeating 
the pupil’s answer to her questions, but should insist 
that all pupils speak so that they can be heard distinctly.
-P-A-G-E-241
  
THE RECITATION 225 
10. It is poor pedagogy, generally, to call for volun- 
teers to recite, or to allow a class to answer in concert. 
By the former method certain pupils are likely to do all 
the reciting, and by the latter the teacher cannot tell 
who is prepared. 
Testing preparation—Every pupil should be tested in 
a definite way on his preparation of the lesson as far 
as it is possible to do this without wasting time. Some 
pupils will always shirk unless they know that they will 
be tested, and if allowed to get by with poor or incom- 
plete work for several days, will thereafter be unable to 
keep up with the class. 
Verifying and criticizing—In the upper grades, and 
in the high school, especially, pupils should be taught to 
criticize their own work as well as that of others. They 
should be taught to verify the accuracy and truth of 
their reading matter and other sources of information, 
as well as of any statement or assertion made by pupils 
during the recitation. In life outside of school we are 
constantly called upon to exercise this precaution in our 
reading and dealing with other people, and it may be 
said that generally it calls for more knowledge and under- 
. standing to reject or criticize a statement than to 
accept it. 
The recitation period affords many opportunities for 
teaching pupils to verify and criticize their own. state- 
ments and theories, and the teacher shold always encour- 
age wholesome criticism. She may also do much by 
pointing out exceptions or limitations, or by showing 
defects in a pupil’s train of thought or steps leading to a 
statement or assertion made. To require pupils to sub- 
mit their conclusions and theories to the class for criti-
-P-A-G-E-242
  
226 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
cism has a wholesome effect in teaching them to be criti- 
cal of their own work. 
Characteristics of pupils—A good teacher will study 
every pupil in her class in order to know his capabilities 
and special aptitudes as well as his weaknesses and short- 
comings, and to deal with these in the most intelligent 
way. 
Some pupils are very sensitive and self-conscious be- 
fore a class, and are likely to become embarrassed or 
bewildered when they fail to recall a given part of the 
lesson, to explain a principle, or to solve a problem. 
This is likely to happen with such pupils even though 
they may have prepared their lessons well. They im- 
mediately become conscious of themselves as objects of 
observation of the entire class and are unable to think 
effectively. A teacher should understand such a condi- 
tion and be careful not to make the pupil conspicuous 
before the class, as this will make the matter worse. In- 
experienced teachers are apt to be too exacting with 
pupils under such circumstances and insist that they 
recite or solve the problem, to a point beyond which is 
advisable. If a pupil becomes embarrassed or confused, 
it is much better to call upon some one else. The aver- 
age mind does not work when forced under such circum- 
stances, and for a teacher to insist on an explanation or 
solution may not only be embarrassing or humiliating to 
the pupil, but positively injurious. What a pupil most 
needs under such circumstances is sympathetic encour- 
agement, and possibly a little individual help outside of 
the recitation period. 
Other pupils are too self-confident and too forward. 
They talk too much and too carelessly, often merely to
-P-A-G-E-243
  THE RECITATION 227 
hear themselves talk. They should be checked closely on 
their inaccuracies and superfluous statements, and made 
to realize that too much talking is as bad or worse than 
too little. 
Interruptions—Generally speaking it is not wise to 
interrupt a pupil while reciting or to insist at all times 
on complete and accurate sentences. To do this is to 
divert his attention from the subject-matter and to break 
his line of thought. Teachers and pupils should watch 
for mistakes, however, and these should be considered and 
corrected when the individual has finished. Grammati- 
cal errors and mispronunciations should always be cor- 
rected, as well as erroneous statements made concerning 
the subject-matter under consideration. 
Economy of time—The teacher should be careful to 
utilize the time of the recitation period to the best advan- 
tage. It is very easy to consume too much time for the 
benefit of an individual pupil to the detriment of the 
entire class. It is unfair, for example, to give too much 
time and attention to one pupil at the blackboard if he 
does not have his lesson prepared or cannot comprehend 
the work. Arrangements should be made to give such 
a pupil individual help outside of the recitation period. 
Likewise no pupil should be sent to the board to demon- 
strate work to the class unless he is well prepared to do 
so. It is a waste of time also to have one pupil do work 
that several or all could be doing at the same time, or to 
send pupils to the board, one at a time, to write down 
a few figures or fractional parts of a problem. By such 
a method more time is frequently consumed in passing to 
and from seats than is justifiable. In drill work where 
many pupils are called upon in turn to give short answers
-P-A-G-E-244
  
  228 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
they should not be required to stand as this consumes 
too much time. 
There should be a definite system for the passing of 
classes, to and from the blackboard, for collecting and 
distributing of papers, materials, etc. In the grades a 
good plan is to have pupils act as monitors in collecting 
and distributing materials or getting things ready for 
the recitation. Likewise certain pupils may clean black- 
boards. They are usually glad to do these things. 
Different methods and types of teaching—From time 
to time educational writers have focused their attention 
and enthusiasm on a particular method or type of teach- 
ing. This has done much to point out special merits and 
advantages, but often the relative merits of a given 
method or type of procedure have been greatly exag- 
gerated, and in many instances there has been nothing 
new excepting new names and terminology. 
The wise and progressive superintendent will realize 
that in order to be able to discriminate between good 
and poor teaching, to determine the relative effectiveness 
of a given method, to point out defects, and to suggest 
improvements he must seek to acquaint himself with the 
general principles and relative merits of the various 
methods commonly employed, and to recognize their 
special application to the teaching of particular subject- 
matter. He will not, however, allow himself to be swept 
off his feet by the claims of radical would-be reformers. 
A variety of different means and methods of procedure 
may be and often are employed to good advantage in 
conducting a given recitation, and various methods of 
teaching may be equally applicable and effective in the 
teaching of several different subjects. The method em-
-P-A-G-E-245
THE RECITATION 229 
ployed will always be determined largely by the nature 
of the subject-matter taught and the end to be accom- 
plished. And not infrequently the method employed 
by a teacher in conducting a given recitation is employed 
without any conscious effort or thought of following a 
specific method or type of procedure. A good teacher 
will familiarize herself with the best means and methods 
available and will consciously and unconsciously study 
their relative values for bringing about the results desired 
in any particular recitation. 
A few of the methods or types of classroom procedure 
which have been much discussed in recent years are 
briefly treated here: 
1. The drill and habituation method. The drill and 
habituation method is employed where it is desirable to 
fix a tendency or process, form a habit, or develop skill 
by repetition; as, for example, in learning to write and 
spell, learning the combinations of the fundamentals in 
arithmetic, learning correct usage of English, typewrit- 
ing, instrumental music, etc. In drill exercises the 
teacher should be especially careful to make the first 
attempts intelligible, and as pleasurable as it is possible 
to make them. In all drill work it is important that the 
laws of habit formation be followed as closely as possible. 
See “Drill and Habit Formation” in Chapter XI on 
“Guiding and Directing Study.” 
2. The question and answer method. The question 
and answer method is commonly employed by all teach- 
ers, since there are few recitations where some question- 
ing and answering is not necessary or advisable. 
It may be said that skilful questioning will accomplish 
the following:
-P-A-G-E-246
230 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
a. It increases the interest of the class. 
b. It teaches pupils to face an issue and to express 
themselves intelligibly. 
c. It affords an opportunity for recalling and 
reviewing. 
d. It affords an opportunity for using knowledge 
already acquired. 
e. It shows pupils how much or how little they know 
about the subject-matter. 
f. It shows pupils where they have succeeded and 
where they have failed and in this way guides them in 
their review or further study. 
g. It enables the teacher to test the pupils’ prepara- 
tion and understanding of the lesson. 
h. It enables the teacher to select and focus atten- 
tion on the essential elements of a lengthy or complex 
question. 
While questioning and answering will probably always 
have an important place in classroom recitation care 
should be exercised not to overwork this method. There 
is a general tendency, especially on the part of inexperi- 
enced teachers to employ this method of conducting a 
recitation to the exclusion of all other methods, or where 
other methods would be more effective. 
In this type of recitation the teacher should observe 
all the requisites of good questioning given under “Ques- 
tioning” in this chapter. 
3. Dramatization. Dramatization is an_ effective 
means for stimulating interest, making vivid impressions, 
and helping pupils to understand clearly through inter- 
esting activity. This, in fact, is often the most effective
-P-A-G-E-247
  THE RECITATION 231 
and the most natural method of presentation and of 
learning. In the words of Thorndike, “The original and 
fundamental form of learning, in the child and in the 
animal kingdom as a whole, is by connecting actual 
movements of the body with the situations which life 
offers. And all through life, for most men in most situa- 
tions when previous habits do not decree otherwise, the 
‘natural,’ favored sort of response is to make one or an- 
other actual movement. Indeed, much that we think of 
superficially as pure thought is rooted in and accom- 
panied by actual motor responses. . . . Gesture, facial 
expression, mimicry and other dramatic movements, 
dancing, drawing, painting, making maps, models, and 
other constructions, probably: all can be used to good 
advantage in getting, applying, and testing knowledge 
and appreciation, as well as in acquiring desirable forms 
of motor skill itself. . . . In general, the arguments that 
hold for the use of concrete realities in impression upon 
the pupil, hold for the use of manual construction, dra- 
matic action, drawing, modeling and the like in expres- 
sion by him.” 2 
Certain lessons in reading, history, and geography can 
be dramatized very effectively. In the lower grades cer- 
tain stories or portions of a selection or play may be 
dramatized by having pupils use the exact words of the 
author. This is an excellent means for training in vo- 
cabulary and conventional sentence structure. Older 
pupils may express the author’s thoughts in their own 
words as this generally affords better training in self- 
expression. Historical dramas and pageants are an ef- 
fective means for teaching certain history lessons, while 
*E. L. Thorndike, Education, pp. 185-187.
-P-A-G-E-248
    
232 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
an imaginary trip or visit on the part of a geography 
class to Iceland or South Africa could be made a vivid 
portrayal of conditions and activities in those countries. 
Many lessons in reading, history, and geography do 
not admit of this type of presentation; and here, as with 
other methods of conducting recitations, care should be 
exercised not to overwork a given scheme or device, or 
to apply a given method to the exclusion of all others. 
4. The lecture method. The lecture method or the 
method of simply telling others facts and conclusions has 
its place in the recitation room when it deals with infor- 
mation that cannot well be worked out or discovered by 
the pupils; but the extensive use of this method has been 
much criticized in recent years, since it does not as a rule 
aid pupils in reasoning, teach them to discover and solve 
problems, or to get further facts from knowledge which 
they already possess. This method should be employed 
sparingly in teaching subject-matter that can be reduced 
to reasoning, experimentation, and observation on the 
part of the class. 
5. The object lesson. The object lesson aims to im- 
part knowledge by the study of objects, activities, and 
conditions through direct observation, participation, or 
experimentation; such as a lesson in agriculture where 
soils, weeds, and other material products are observed 
and studied; a lesson in physics with the use of apparatus 
and material substances; or a visit to some shop or fac- 
tory to observe and study the products, activities, or 
conditions. 
Where it is possible to study concrete material, activi- 
ties, and conditions by direct observation and participa- 
tion this is a simple way of imparting knowledge and
-P-A-G-E-249
  THE RECITATION 233 
much more effective than where the information must be 
acquired through reading about these things or by hear- 
ing someone tell about them. 
An object lesson should be carefully planned in ad- 
vance. There must be a definite aim and purpose and 
the attention of the class must be directed and held 
closely to the facts to be observed and studied if good 
results are to be obtained. In case of an excursion care 
must be exercised not to make it a mere pleasure trip. 
Pupils should be definitely instructed beforehand as to 
what they should study and how to proceed. They 
should then be held accountable for results. 
6. The scientific method. The method of procedure 
often designated as the scientific method has a wide ap- 
plication in all lines of study, but is especially applicable 
to natural science subjects. It calls for both inductive 
and deductive reasoning and is well adapted for training 
pupils in systematic methods of inquiry. According to 
Carl Pearson, “The scientific method is marked by the 
following features: (a) careful and accurate classification 
of facts and observation of their correlation and se- 
quence; (b) the discovery of scientific laws by aid of the 
creative imagination; (c) self-criticism and the final 
touchstone of equal validity for all normally constituted 
minds.” # 
?. The problem method. The problem method is an- 
other term frequently employed in the classification of 
methods for conducting recitations. This method also 
calls for careful observation, analysis, reasoning, and 
creative imagination. It aims to form correct habits in 
*“Pearson on Scientific Method” in Judd’s Psychology of High School 
Subjects, p. 342, 
 
-P-A-G-E-250
  234 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
original thinking and problem solving. In this type of 
teaching the teacher must provide for suitable problems. 
These problems should be of proper difficulty for the 
average class member, and should be of a practical char- 
acter, arising out of social needs and immediate environ- 
ment. It is best adapted, however, to the teaching of 
some subjects and certain lessons, and should not be 
employed where some other method would be more effec- 
tive or more applicable. 
The following is a list of suggestive problems that may 
be considered as typical and suitable for the problem 
method of teaching: 
a. Construction of mounds and cardboard houses in 
primary grades. 
b. The dress of the Indian before his mode of living 
was affected by the white man. 
The food and fuel of the Eskimo. 
The preservation of the teeth. 
The water supply of a city. 
The prevention of fires. 
The safety of the street. 
. Planning a trip. 
Raising money for an entertainment. 
j. To determine the specific gravity of a liquid. 
Samuel Chester Parker in the last of a series of articles 
on “Problem-Solving or Practice in Thinking” * gives the 
following summary of rules for conducting problem- 
solving lessons: 
“1, Get them to define the problem clearly. 
2. Aid them to keep the problem in mind.

3. Get them to make many suggestions by encouraging 
them— 
a. To analyze the situation into parts. 
b. To recall previously known similar cases and gen- 
eral rules that apply. 
c. To guess courageously and formulate guesses 
clearly. 
4. Get them to evaluate each suggestion carefully by 
encouraging them— 
a. To maintain a state of doubt or suspended 
conclusion. 
b. To criticize the suggestion by anticipating ob- 
jections and consequences. 
c. To verify conclusions by appeal to known facts, 
miniature experiments, and scientific treatises. 
5. Get them to organize the material by proceeding— 
a. To build an outline on the board. 
b. To use diagrams and graphs. 
ce. To take stock from time to time. 
d. To formulate concise statements of the net out- 
come of the discussions.” 
8. The project method. We have heard much about 
the project method and project-teaching during the past 
five years. This method or type of teaching also has 
much in common with the other methods here discussed, 
especially the object method, the scientific method, and 
the problem method. 
A survey of recent educational literature reveals many 
definitions of the terms project method, project teaching, 
and project problem, and the meaning and content as-
-P-A-G-E-252
  236 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
signed to the word project in this connection varies con- 
siderably. We are not here concerned however with 
exact or complete definitions. For our purpose the fol- 
lowing references and extracts will suffice to explain the 
project method or project-teaching: 
Dr. Horn, in his study based on the reports of 120 
advanced students in a course given by him at the Uni- 
versity of Chicago during the summer of 1919, found that 
“project for the great majority of teachers refers to an 
activity which is problematic, taken in its actual setting, 
and involving the use of concrete material, particularly 
in a constructive way.” ® 
According to Hattie L. Lawley, “When the word 
project, as applied to educational procedure, first came 
into vogue, its meaning was clear-cut and well defined. 
It implied the transfer of a situation of real life to the 
schoolroom with the intention to vitalizing and adding 
to the interest of the ordinary work, and with a forward 
look toward preparing pupils for situations which they 
might encounter later in real life. 
“Thus defined, the project marked a progressive step 
in education. It seemed to look ever toward new con- 
tact between schoolroom life and real life. 
“The term has, however, come to be applied so loosely 
that its meaning is growing muddled. More and more 
frequently it is applied indiscriminately to all school- 
room ‘stunts,’ to all devices out of the ordinary, to dra- 
matization, to the play way, even to problems and 
exercises.” ® 
° Ernest Horn, “What is a Project?” The Elementary School Journal, 
Oct., 1920. °Hattie L. Lawley, “Real Projects and Others,’ The Elementary 
School Journal, June, 1921.  
-P-A-G-E-253
  THE RECITATION 237 
Parker calls attention to the fact that project teaching 
when conceived as the pupil-planning of practical activi- 
ties, is clearly a subdivision of the larger topic, problem- 
solving; that in project-teaching the pupil is always con- 
fronted with some problem, but a problem of a practical 
character, as distinguished from theoretical or speculative 
problems. He points out that a practical project prob- 
lem in history might be “How shall we dramatize the life 
of Washington and his troops at Valley Forge?” while a 
theoretical problem would be “Who was the greater gen- 
eral, Washington or Frederick the Great?” 7 
From the preceding discussion it will be seen that the 
advantages claimed for the study of objective activities, 
actual participation, and the use of concrete material 
will apply equally to the project method of teaching; 
and that this method is applicable to the teaching of 
much of the subject-matter in various grades and depart- 
ments. 
9. The socialized recitation. Recently we have heard 
a great deal about the socialized recitation, which may be 
said to be a form of recitation or method of procedure 
in which the pupils take an active part. The teacher’s 
chief duty being to check any tendency to foolishness, 
to make suggestions, and to supply needed help. “The 
teacher’s work becomes the background rather than the 
working center of the class period.” 
The chief advantages claimed by the advocates of 
the socialized recitation are the following: 
1. It provides a greater opportunity for pupil-partici- 
pation and activity. 
_"Samuel Chester Parker, “Project-Teaching: Pupils Planning Prac- 
tical Activities,’ Elementary School Journal, Jan., 1922.
-P-A-G-E-254
238 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
2. It affords a better opportunity for the development 
of initiative and leadership on the part of the pupil. 
3. It develops self-control and responsibility. 
4. It promotes freedom of thought and speech. 
5. It develops interest and codperation. 
6. It makes possible a wider range of approach to the 
topic under consideration. 
Some of the disadvantages named are the following: 
1. It is more difficult and sometimes quite impossible 
for inexperienced and weak teachers to control and disci- 
pline their classes by this method, or to keep the lesson 
within proper bounds. 
2. Certain pupils will talk too much and strive for 
show, while others will talk too little or make their ex- 
planations too brief. 
3. It wastes time by having pupils who are not trained 
in pedagogy or the art of questioning take charge of the 
class. 
4. “Sometimes it leads to the formation of wrong 
bonds—for instance, working the teacher instead of 
learning.” 
5. It affords an easy way for a careless or indifferent 
teacher to shirk her work. 
6. It is not adapted to all teachers, classes, and sub- 
jects or recitations. 
A superintendent should understand that the socialized. 
recitation is merely a method of procedure; that the so- 
cializing of any recitation is a matter of degree; that 
any form of recitation well conducted is more or less 
socialized; and that any form of recitation must be deter- 
mined largely by the subject-matter and. the aim of the
-P-A-G-E-255
  THE RECITATION 239 
lesson. This will vary greatly from day to day and with 
different subjects. 
The writer does not question the validity of the claims 
made for the socialized recitation, and believes that all 
recitations should be socialized as far as conditions will 
permit, or as far as seems advisable. This, however, 
must be determined to a large extent by the experience 
or capability of the teacher, the discipline and ability of 
the class, and the subject-matter and aim of the lesson. 
The following outline will serve to show one way of 
conducting a socialized recitation, or it may be used as a 
guide for other forms: 
1. Divide the lesson into two or more parts. Assign 
these parts to different pupils who will act as leaders. 
These leaders must outline their parts, prepare questions, 
and gather outside data. All pupils should, of course, 
be required to prepare their lesson. 
2. When the class meets appoint a “critic-chairman” 
to correct errors and see that important points are prop- 
erly developed. The teacher should assist in this when- 
ever it seems advisable or necessary. 
38. A leader is called upon to state his questions. He in 
turn calls on one or more pupils to answer these ques- 
tions. If they are not well answered, volunteers may be 
called for. The leader may also make corrections and 
add information. 
4. The teacher remains in the background and calls 
attention to errors or wrong conclusions that may not be 
corrected or cleared by some member of the class. 
A review of the above methods and devices reveals the 
fact that all of these schemes have their special merits
-P-A-G-E-256
  240 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
and advantages, worthy of careful consideration; That 
the practicability and advisability of the use of any of 
them, however, will depend largely on the class, the 
subject-matter under consideration, and the purpose of 
the lesson; that in certain recitations one or two of these 
methods or devices might well be employed to the exclu- 
sion of all others; and that in other instances several or 
all of them might be employed advantageously in con- 
ducting a given or single recitation.

  CHAPTER XV 
THE LESSON ASSIGNMENT 
Importance of a carefully made assignment—No part 
of the recitation period is more important than the as- 
signment of the advance lesson, and at no time does the 
teacher have a greater opportunity to be of real service 
to her pupils than during the lesson assignment. 
The extent to which the daily assignment is made 
clear and definite will have much to do with the pupils’ 
daily preparation of the lesson and with the progress of 
the class. A carefully planned and definite assignment 
with definite directions as to method of procedure in 
preparation, will usually mean direct aims and definite 
results on the part of the pupils during the study hour. 
On the other hand, much waste of time and energy, dis- 
couragement, and many a failure are due to the teacher’s 
inability or negligence in making the lesson assignment 
sufficiently definite and comprehensible. 
Planning the assignment—The teacher should have 
in mind a definite aim or purpose to be accomplished in 
each lesson, and should plan the assignment accordingly. 
This means that she must not only be familiar with the 
subject-matter of the lesson she intends to assign and 
with the text book and reference material to be used, but 
must be able to prescribe a definite method of treating 
this subject-matter. The method of treatment will vary 
241
-P-A-G-E-258
  242 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
with the grade or class and with the nature of the work. 
It is obvious that in the lower grades the assignment 
must be very simple as well as definite, and that the 
greater part of the work in such subjects as spelling, 
arithmetic, and grammar does not call for elaborate 
planning. 
In order to make the assignment clear and definite the 
teacher must study the lesson in advance. Inexperienced 
teachers, especially, often fail to realize the importance 
of making this advance preparation. And a teacher who 
has not gone over the lesson beforehand is very likely 
to underestimate the time required for the pupils to do 
the work assigned, since she does not know just what she 
is asking for, and does not at this time know what her 
pupils are capable of doing. She is also likely to forget 
that what seems familiar and comparatively easy to her 
is new to the pupils and therefore more difficult for them 
to understand. Inexperienced teachers may well write 
out their lesson plans somewhat in detail, but should as 
soon as possible strive to reduce the writing to a few 
short statements of aims, leading thoughts, illustrative 
material, and references. 
Know what the pupils can do—A good teacher will 
strive to know what her pupils can do in a given time, 
and will endeavor to adjust the lesson to the ability of 
the class. She will assign to the class as a whole only 
what the majority of the pupils can do well in a reason- 
able time, and will then hold every member accountable 
for an honest effort to do the work assigned. In case of 
high school or departmentalized work she will bear in 
mind and make proper allowance for the pupil’s time 
claimed by other teachers. It is quite common for each
-P-A-G-E-259
  THE LESSON ASSIGNMENT 243 
of several teachers to consider her work as most neces- 
sary or most important, and to make assignments that 
will call for more than her share of the pupil’s time. 
As far as possible provisions should be made for pupils 
who can do more than those of average ability. It is 
usually possible to assign to these outside problems from 
time to time, or additional work in connection with the 
regular assignment. They may then be asked to report 
or recite on this at a suitable time. 
Make sure that pupils know what to look for and how 
to proceed—The teacher should make absolutely sure 
that the pupils know just what to look for and how to 
go to work without losing time or interest. This means 
that she must be able to anticipate their difficulties and 
explain sufficiently in detail the method of attack and 
procedure in learning new principles and solving difficult 
problems. When information is to be obtained from 
outside the text books, the source or sources of material 
should be made very clear, especially in the lower grades. 
Where references are given from two or more books or 
magazines, topic headings and page numbers should be 
given. This will enable pupils to use their time effectively, 
and will tend to hold them responsible for the work, while 
vague and indefinite assignments will tend to make cer- 
tain ones shirk and cheat. In the grammar grades and 
high school, pupils should, of course, know how to find 
what is in a book or a magazine, but the teacher should 
make sure that they do know. It is surprising sometimes 
to find what pupils do not know. On the other hand care 
must be exercised not to give more aid than is necessary 
as this will cause certain ones to depend too much on 
help from the teacher and will retard their growth, by
-P-A-G-E-260
  
244 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
making it unnecessary for them to exercise their own 
initiative or to make a real effort. Pupils should be 
taught and required to think for themselves, but should 
not be allowed to spend their time in groping in the dark. 
Development of lesson—The time to be given to the 
development of a lesson will depend on the subject- 
matter and nature of the work. From ten to fifteen min- 
utes may well be given to the development of certain 
lessons. Usually it is advisable to go over the lesson in 
class with books open and to give the class a bird’s-eye 
view or general idea of what the entire lesson is about. 
New principles.and difficult problems should always be 
pointed out and explained or demonstrated. There is no 
better way for a teacher to teach pupils how to study 
than to study with them occasionally, calling attention 
to methods of procedure, principles of learning, etc. 
Collecting and organizing material around a few main 
points—Pupils should be taught to collect and organize 
subordinate and contributing material around a few 
main, important points. This will help them to recall 
the subordinate material and will give special emphasis 
to the more important matter. It will teach them to 
discriminate between the essentials and non-essentials in 
their reading, by developing a habit of conscious selection 
of important matter. Many pupils never acquire the art 
of sifting the important from the unimportant matter. 
Some study their text books too closely, trying to re- 
member words and sentences, while others read over the 
entire lesson hurriedly a certain number of times, think- 
ing every line and sentence is of equal importance, and 
expecting to comprehend the lesson as a whole by a cer- 
tain number of readings. Both these methods are wrong
-P-A-G-E-261
  
THE LESSON ASSIGNMENT 245 
and it is the teacher’s duty to correct such faulty 
methods. Pupils should be instructed to read over the 
lesson first for general meaning and purpose, and then 
study single paragraphs by reading and rereading them 
until they understand them and have the central thought 
fixed in mind. 
A good way to teach pupils to organize material and 
make definite preparation is to assign in certain subjects 
each day some four or five important topics or questions 
for a written quiz to be given the following day. The 
first five or ten minutes of the recitation period may then 
be devoted to writing on these topics or questions, or 
pupils may be required to write on these assignments 
during the study period and hand in their papers at the 
next recitation. Such a method is very effective in bring- 
ing about a certain amount of preparation on the part of 
all pupils. 
Illustration—Whenever it is possible or practicable to 
do so the teacher should illustrate problems and matter 
which is difficult of solution by examples, forms, or de- 
scriptive sketches on the blackboard. This will frequently 
aid pupils to see or apprehend more clearly, and to re- 
member better. In such subjects as history and geog- 
raphy, physiology and biology, maps and charts should 
be used extensively. Many pupils can remember a thing 
best by a mental image of its form. 
Special reports—In the upper grades and high school 
it is well to assign each pupil some special problem from 
time to time, to be prepared and reported on at a later 
time, or pupils may select these problems with the ap- 
proval of the teacher. Where this is done all pupils 
should have an assignment and all should be required to
-P-A-G-E-262
246 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
report. Here also, the problem assigned, the method of 
treatment, and the source or sources of material to be 
investigated should be made sufficiently definite and com- 
prehensible in order that pupils may know how to pro- 
ceed intelligently. In making these directions clear and 
definite many teachers fall short. Unless the class is 
very small it is necessary, too, for the teacher to make 
a record of the assignments made, and a definite time 
limit should be set for preparation. When reports on 
special assignments are made, all members of the class 
should be held responsible for a knowledge of the leading 
facts or central thoughts brought out in each report. 
This may be accomplished best by requiring that pupils 
make brief notes while the report is being made. The 
nature of the report will, of course, vary greatly with the 
subject or problem assigned. Generally speaking, reports 
in such subjects as geography, history, and social science 
should not be written out completely to be read before 
the class, but should be prepared in outline from which 
the pupil should recite. If the pupils have not had 
proper instructions in the making of outlines they should 
be definitely instructed at this time. 
Have work kept up to date—The teacher should insist 
that pupils complete the work assigned as far as possible 
each day. Some pupils are indifferent and will always 
shirk unless they are strictly required to do the work 
assigned. It is the teacher’s duty to see to it that they 
do not let their notebook and other work lag. Whenever 
back work is allowed to accumulate, a bad habit is being 
formed and the pupil, usually, is started on the way to 
poor and failing grades. Many a one has received con- 
ditional or failing grades because the teacher did not
-P-A-G-E-263
THE LESSON ASSIGNMENT 247 
check up on his notebook or other work before the end 
of the term or semester. 
When to make the assignment—The best time to 
assign the advance lesson depends upon various and 
varying conditions. Where the assignment is not based 
upon the work of the previous recitation it may be made 
at the beginning of the class period; but where it is de- 
pendent in part on the recitation to be conducted, or is 
a continuation or outgrowth of the recitation work, which 
it frequently is, it is obvious that it cannot well be made 
at the beginning of the period. Whenever the assign- 
ment is to be made at the end of the period, care should 
be exercised to allow sufficient time to have it made 
properly. 
Suggestive Outlines and Illustrations 
For our purpose it does not seem advisable to treat in 
detail here specific lesson assignments for all the subjects 
in the different grades. Furthermore, the method of 
attack, points of contact, and development will generally 
be suggested in the text books used, and the teacher will 
need to take this into consideration. A few outlines and 
illustrations are here given in the belief that they will be 
suggestive of what can be done in other subjects, and 
serve as guides in helping teachers to organize their 
subject-matter and make their assignments definite. 
The following on the study of a selection is taken from 
the Course of Study for the Elementary Schools of South 
Dakota: 
“Tt is evident that if a full and complete study is to be 
made of any ‘story’ in prose or poetry, historical, bio- 
graphical, or pure invention, there are a great many

  248 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
things to be considered and that many readings of the 
selection must be made before the study can be ex- 
hausted. It is not wise to study every phase of every 
narrative; it may not be necessary to do so on any, but 
if the teacher has all phases in mind, she can apply to 
any given piece that kind of study it most richly rewards 
and can use those portions which are adapted to the age 
of the pupil. A complete study of a story would consider 
the points embraced in the following general outline:

Reading 
In making an assignment in reading the following 
should be borne in mind: 
1. The assignment should develop a certain amount of 
familiarity with the lesson and should point out some of 
the difficulties. 
2. In the lower grades the chief difficulties should be 
anticipated and cleared during the lesson assignment. 
8. The primary purpose should be interpretation; the 
secondary, expression. 
4, The final aim should be to beget independent think- 
ing and acting. 
5. Direct attention should be centered on those phases 
of reading that require particular attention. 
6. Pupils should be taught to give special attention to 
new words and unusual expressions. 
7. Interest can often be stimulated by telling part of 
the selection to the class.

CHAPTER XVI 
WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS AND MARKINGS 
The use of written examinations as a means for de- 
termining the achievement and promotion of pupils dates 
back to the beginning of our history of education. Much 
has been said for and against the necessity, the reliability, 
and the justice of the written examination in general, and 
in recent years, especially, have we heard a great deal 
of unfavorable criticism on the term and semester 
examination. 
Notwithstanding all that has been said, if properly 
conducted, these examinations serve a useful purpose for 
both teacher and pupils, and in passing judgment on 
their merits and demerits in general they should be con- 
sidered from all angles. Those who most violently decry 
the use of examinations in schools frequently confuse 
means and ends. They do not see both sides of the prob- 
lem, or take into account all the factors involved. 
Usually they are those who are engaged in some particu- 
lar kind or phase of educational work which enables them 
to pose as superior pedagogical advisors, even in matters 
concerning which they have only a partial understanding. 
As a rule they are not directly engaged in or obliged to 
cope with the problem of conducting large numbers of 
pupils through successive years of school work. These 
would-be reformers not infrequently confuse and pervert 
255 
 
-P-A-G-E-272
  256 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
public opinion by presenting graphic and convincing data 
on their side of the proposition in total ignorance of the 
factors involved on the other side. 
Advantages and disadvantages—We shall point out 
briefly a few of the advantages and disadvantages of the 
written term and semester examination that every school 
administrator should know. 
Written examinations are not always a fair test of a_ 
pupil’s achievement or ability, and it is easy to over- 
estimate their importance in this respect. Much may 
depend on the ingenuity of the teacher giving the exami- 
nation, on the phy:. 11 condition of the pupil, and on 
various other factors. It may safely be said, however, 
that if the examination questions are carefully prepared, 
and if they are confined to such knowledge of the subject 
covered as should be remembered, they are as a rule a 
reasonably fair test of the pupil’s understanding of the 
subject-matter under consideration. It must be ad- 
mitted, too, that the examination does show the pupil’s 
ability or inability, under the circumstances, -to write 
legibly, to spell, to punctuate, to compose sentences, to 
recall, and to express himself clearly concerning what he 
does recall and understand. This is something, but it is 
by no means the only value or purpose of an examination. © 
Furthermore, a pupil’s standing and promotion seldom is, 
and should never be, based entirely upon the examina- 
tion. In practically all good school systems the examina- 
tion grade counts for one-third or one-half while the 
class work counts for two-thirds or one-half. 
A competent teacher may know practically as much 
about the general ability of the majority of her pupiis 
before as after the examination. If the questions are >
-P-A-G-E-273
  WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS AND MARKINGS 257 
carefully selected and the examination is properly con- 
ducted there will generally be a close relation between 
‘the examination and the daily class grade, in spite of all 
that has been said to the contrary. But something addi- 
tional will always be revealed, and it is not the sole pur- 
pose of the examination to determine what a pupil knows 
or does not know about the subject. This fact should not 
« be overlooked. : 
Many schools are now using standardized tests to 
measure the speed and accuracy of certain abilities or 
phases of the pupil’s work, and in gome places general 
ability or intelligence tests are réW used as a basis for 
promotion. Some of the disadvantages and defects of 
the ordinary examination are overcome in these tests. 
They, however, also have their disadvantages and limita- 
tions, especially when applied. to the more intangible 
aspects of education. These tests will be dealt with in 
the next chapter. 
Preparing to pass examinations—Some maintain that 
term and semester examinations tend to make pupils 
prepare themselves to pass the examination rather than 
to understand the subject, and that they lead to useless 
or injurious cramming at the eleventh hour. In reply to 
‘this it may be said that if the examination questions are 
carefully prepared and if there are thought questions as 
well as memory questions on the essentials of the work 
covered by the class, there can be no more objection to 
having pupils prepare their work with a view to write a 
good examination than to prepare it with a view to make 
a good class recitation; and, as stated before, the daily- 
‘Class grade should always count for as much or more than 
the examination grade in determining a pupil’s achieve- 
 
-P-A-G-E-274
  258 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
ment or promotion. There are pupils, no doubt, in every 
school who spend some time and effort in preparing es- 
pecially to pass an examination, which time and effort 
might be spent to better advantage if they were to seek 
only to understand. But it is very doubtful that such 
pupils would get more out of their work if they were not 
required to pass examinations on the subject. They are 
the very ones who most need the incentive of examina- - 
tions in their daily work. 
Reviewing and cramming—aAll term and semester 
examinations should be preceded by a reasonable amount 
of review work. Where this is done there is not likely to - 
be any great amount of cramming, and where it is not 
done a certain amount of hasty review or cramming is 
better than no review at all. In fact, any kind of review 
for a properly conducted examination compels not only 
a repetition of the essentials of the subject, but also or- 
ganization of the material reviewed. The importance of 
review and organization can hardly be over-emphasized, 
and it can be done most effectively only after the pupil 
has covered the various topics or parts of the subject. 
It may be said that one of the chief benefits to be claimed 
for formal examination is the fact that they serve as a 
stimulus for concentrating attention upon the necessity 
of a careful review and organization of the work covered. 
Worry and fear of failure—We frequently hear it said 
that examinations cause unnecessary and injurious worry 
and fear on the part of pupils. It is true, no doubt, that 
they do cause some worry and fear of failure which is 
more or less injurious, especially to pupils of a nervous 
temperament. Whenever it is reasonably necessary and 
possible to relieve such pupils of any worry over the
-P-A-G-E-275
WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS AND MARKINGS 259 
outcome of their examinations, or to make allowance for 
their condition it should be done; and in many instances 
it can be done with the codperation of the parents or the 
school nurse. These pupils should be encouraged, and 
advised not to take the examination too seriously. 
It does not follow from this, however, that examina- 
tions should be abolished. School work must of necessity 
be conducted with classes of such size as to make it 
economically possible, and the aim generally must be that 
of the greatest good for the greatest number. It is safe 
to say that there will always be a certain amount of 
. injustice in schools as well as in other spheres of life, 
where we have injustice to contend with on every hand. 
The school is a good place to teach pupils to face without 
worry or fear a difficult situation involving a slight 
element of injustice. It may be said, too, that for many 
a wholesome sense of fear of possible failure is profitable 
and quite necessary to successful school work. Pupils 
know that if they prepare their daily assignments well 
they are reasonably sure to pass their term and semester 
examinations, and knowing this the examinations are a 
wholesome incentive for those who are inclined to let 
their work lag. 
Other values and purposes—Aside from its value as a 
stimulus for review and organization of subject-matter, 
and as a test of the pupil’s achievement and ability, the 
examination as an exercise in itself is of considerable 
value. To quote from the Indiana course of study, 
“When properly conducted, school examinations serve a 
useful purpose. Their chief value is to the pupil rather 
than to the teacher. They open the pupil’s eyes to his 
limitations and reveal to him how much or how little he 
 
-P-A-G-E-276
260 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
knows. They stimulate pupils to thorough study and 
teach them to apply and express their knowledge. They 
constitute excellent training in quick, accurate, syste- 
matic thinking.” ? 
The fact that there is some element of chance about 
an examination is as a rule not so important or so harm- 
ful as some alarmists would have us believe, in schools 
where the examinations are reasonably well adminis- 
tered. Life abounds in uncertainties. They are a part of 
the teachings of destiny, and there is no good reason why 
every normal pupil should not be exposed oecasionally 
to something that has in it an element of chance or un- 
certainty. Likewise it may be said that every normal 
pupil should be taught to summon his resources and exert 
himself to the utmost occasionally, or to do an occasional 
irksome or disagreeable task, even under adverse con- 
ditions and somewhat abnormal pressure. We are in 
danger of losing some of the will power and other mental 
fiber that characterizes the sturdy pioneer. There is a 
tendency nowadays to eliminate from our school work 
everything that cannot be definitely and positively ac- 
complished with fair efforts and under ideal conditions. 
Many never learn to work persistently under adverse 
conditions or against resistances, and are ill prepared to 
meet the demands of life outside of school. 
The following passage is taken from Dr. W. C. Bagley’s 
article in the Illinois State course of study: “The fact 
that it is of rather critical importance compels the indi- 
vidual to exert himself to the utmost. One cannot work 
under high pressure at all times, but an occasional 
+ Manual With Course of Study for the Elementary Schools of In- 
diana, 1921, p. 284,
-P-A-G-E-277
  WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS AND MARKINGS 261 
stimulus to extreme effort is not at all to be deplored. 
Every pupil should know what intense concentration 
means, and what can be done under such conditions.” ? 
It is doubtful whether any time spent in school is spent 
more profitably than that which is spent in the imme- 
diate preparation for and in the writing of examinations. 
The thinking power that is generated in wrestling with 
examinations; the value derived from being required 
to summon and utilize one’s resources under trying con- 
ditions; the courage, determination, and perseverance 
called forth and developed; and the lessons taught by an 
occasional failure, will be the rocks of refuge to many a 
one in the crucial moments of later life. 
Summary of Things to Be Kept in Mind 
1. Examinations should not be looked upon as ends in 
themselves but rather as a means to an end. 
2. Formal examination should be preceded by a care- 
ful review. Informal test should be given from time 
to time. 
3. The questions should in every instance be as fair 
and as clear as it is possible to make them. They should 
be written on the blackboard or given to pupils on 
mimeographed or printed sheets. 
4. The questions asked in an examination should be 
such that the answer does not depend upon the pupil’s 
ability to recall some isolated fact or statement. In life 
outside of school problems do not present themselves for 
solution in this way. The type of questions will vary 
greatly with the subject-matter. Generally the questions 
?W. C. Bagley, Course ay Study for the Common Schools of Illinois 
(Sixth Revision), pp.
-P-A-G-E-278
  262 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
should aim to test the pupil’s understanding and memory 
of principles and important phases of the work covered. 
Minor details should not be asked for except as a part 
of a major or central question. 
5. There should be thought questions as well as 
memory questions. Occasionally it is well to ask ques- 
tions to be answered with the aid of text books. 
6. It is quite common and often advisable to give 
ten questions, for example, and allow pupils to write on 
any eight or nine of these. 
7. Pupils should be taught to look upon examinations 
as a partial test of their achievement and ability, but 
care should be exercised not to cause nervous pupils to 
worry unduly over the outcome of their examinations. 
8. It is generally held that formal examination should 
not be given below the fifth grade. 
9. A pupil’s ability or promotion should never be based 
solely on his examination grades, but on his average daily 
class grades and examination grade combined. 
Marking and Grading 
The marking and grading of the daily class work and 
examination papers constitutes a problem in itself, but 
one that cannot well be separated from the examination. 
Standards vary with schools and grading varies with 
teachers, It has been shown by investigation that the 
grading of a given paper will vary greatly, not only with 
different teachers, but with the same teacher grading the 
same work at different times. 
A school administrator can do much to bring about 
uniformity in grading among the teachers of a school 
system by defining carefully the value of the marks used
-P-A-G-E-279
  WRITTEN EXAMINATIONS AND MARKINGS 263 
and by requiring that all teachers seek to distribute their 
grades as a whole in accordance with some prearranged 
plan. This is especially important in high school or 
where the work is departmentalized. An arbitrary plan 
may be adopted, or a plan may be worked out with the 
aid of the teachers. This can be done by having every 
teacher compute the percentage of each grade given and 
having these percentages arranged in tabular form for 
comparison. This will often reveal the fact that some 
one or a few teachers are grading uniformly higher or 
lower than the others, and that there is no good reason 
for their doing so. Such a comparison will convince the 
average teacher of the necessity of establishing a common 
understanding of the values of the different marks used, 
and adopting some plan of distribution to be followed 
by all teachers, for the sake of uniformity. 
Since it is quite impossible to grade a pupil’s work 
with a degree of accuracy corresponding to a per cent, it 
is better to indicate grades by letters. These letters may 
be defined in terms of-per cent, but they should stand for 
units of ten or more per cent each. A variety of plans 
or schemes are in use. The five-letter scheme is probably 
the most commonly used at present. The writer has 
adopted this plan and has given out the following direc- 
tions to be followed by all his teachers: 
The letters E, G, F, U, and P will be used in grading 
throughout the schools, and should be interpreted as 
follows: 
90 to 100 per cent 
80 to 89 per cent 
79 per cent 
60 to 69 per cent 
below 60 per cent Nadya Hii

264 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
Teachers should get the best results possible for the 
greatest number, and then distribute the total number 
of grades given in all subjects with a view to obtaining 
for the school as a whole the following percentages of the 
respective letters: 
From 5 to 15 per cent E’s 
From 20 to 35 per cent G’s 
From 35 to 55 per cent F’s 
From 10 to 25 per cent U’s 
From 3 to 10 per cent P’s 
The above method is based on the assumption that 
from 35 to 55 per cent of a large group of pupils in a 
given community or school are of average ability. This 
ability is assumed to be the most common and is repre- 
sented by F. The F may therefore be interpreted as the 
mode or most frequently occurring measure. Likewise 
it may be said that E stands for ability that is reached 
by from 5 to 15 per cent of all pupils. It stands for 
excellent or exceptional, and must be limited to a smaller 
number. If a teacher should give a large per cent of 
E grades the E would lose its value, since a mark given 
to many pupils cannot remain the exception. 
It may be said that the distribution and limits pre- 
scribed for the different marks determine their values, 
and that such a method enables a school administrator 
to secure greater uniformity in the grading done by the 
various teachers of a school system. Without some 
scheme or plan to bring about a common understanding 
of the relative values of the marks used, the grades given 
by the teachers of a system in many instances would not 
be even roughly comparable.

CHAPTER XVII 
MEASUREMENTS AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 
During the past decade there has been much interest 
and activity in the development of definite units of 
measurement and standardized tests. This activity has 
brought about various important contributions in the 
field of education. It has served to point out weaknesses 
in former methods and has done much to hasten the 
adoption of more intelligent means for improvement. It 
has developed definite terms and comparable measure- 
ments. It has in fact given us a new set of tools with 
which to measure certain traits and abilities, and has 
revealed the complexity of what is involved in the meas- 
urement of certain others. Standardized tests and scales 
are now used in many schools throughout this country 
and in a number of other countries. 
Discriminating good from evil—Along with the good 
produced by the enthusiasm and vigorous activity in 
tests and measurements there has been a certain amount 
of accompanying evil. Not all the gains have been net 
gains, and we have yet considerable worthless matter and 
humbug to separate from the good. Exaggerated and 
unwarranted claims have been made for some of the 
tests and scales produced. Too often the practicability 
of their continued use in public schools has been disre- 
garded, and in some instances they have been misleading. 
266
-P-A-G-E-283
  MEASUREMENTS AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 267 
On the other hand the movement has suffered abuse by 
conservative and prejudiced school administrators as well 
as by self-seeking college professors. It does not follow 
from this that the activity as a whole should be discour- 
aged or discredited. It does follow, however, that the 
school administrator must exercise his own judgment as 
to the practicability and usefulness of a given test or 
scale for his particular school system; and in order to 
do this intelligently he must make a study of at least 
a number of the tests and scales most commonly used, 
and keep in touch with the movement as a whole. To 
quote Sidney L. Pressey of the University of Indiana, 
“The fact is there is a ‘boom’ in tests. The wise school 
official will try, under such circumstances, to discriminate 
the good from the bad, and will neither be swept off his 
feet by the present enthusiasm nor discredit the whole 
movement because some of the work is injudicious.” 
It is probable that the “boom” has reached its zenith 
and that we are now on our way toward gradual, whole- 
some progress. The progressive superintendent will 
familiarize himself as far as possible with the various 
tests and scales available in order that he may know how 
to determine what is good and suitable for his purpose 
and how to use it, as well as how to avoid that which is 
not good or suitable. 
Selecting tests—In selecting a test to be given the 
following should be carefully considered: (1) The cost 
of the material; (2) the preparation and time required 
for giving the test; (3) the preparation and time required 
for marking the test papers and calculating the scores; 
(4) the probability of the test revealing the information 
sought; and (5) the likeliness of being able to utilize  
-P-A-G-E-284
  268 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
the data profitably after it has been obtained. From 
(4) and (5) it follows also that there should be a definite 
aim or purpose in selecting the test to be given. 
School administrators who are new in the field and 
those who are not familiar with the leading tests and 
scales in use will do well to supply themselves with sam- 
ple copies and directions of a few of the more simple ones 
and to select for the first test to be given one that is 
easily given and easily scored. The Ayres Spelling Scale, 
the Courtis Arithmetic Tests, The Monroe Silent Read- 
ing Test, and the Ayres Handwriting Scale are among 
those that are easily given and easily scored, and widely 
used. Sample copies of these and other tests and scales, 
with directions, may be obtained from the following 
distributing centers:

dan and A. R. Gilliland.

  MEASUREMENTS AND ee TESTS 269 
General rules and directions for giving tests—In giv- 
ing standardized tests it is important that the following 
general rules and directions be observed: 
1. Study the printed directions for the test until you 
are thoroughly familiar with them. It is well to go 
through the test one or more times as you would if you 
were giving it to a class. Most of the better tests are 
easy to understand and to give. Those that are too 
difficult or too involved to be understood by the average 
teacher should be avoided. 
2. Follow the directions to the letter. If this is not 
done a comparison of the scores with those of other 
classes and with the standard scores will not be reliable 
or just. 
3. Allow the exact time specified for giving the test, 
no more or no less. In order to gage the time correctly 
it is quite necessary to have a watch with a second hand 
or a stop watch. 
4. Care should be exercised to give the test in such 
manner that the pupils will not become excited or dis- 
turbed because it is a test. The most reliable results 
will be obtained when the pupils work most naturally. 
5. The aim should be not to secure the highest possible 
score for the class, but a reliable measure of the abilities 
of the pupils when working in a natural way. 
6. To obtain the most reliable measure of abilities a 
test should not be given when pupils are tired. A test 
in writing should not be given immediately after the 
opening of school in the morning or immediately after 
a recess period. 
7. Explicit directions for the marking of papers and 
the recording of scores are usually furnished in connec-
-P-A-G-E-286
  270 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
tion with the tests. These directions must be followed 
carefully if the comparisons with the standards are to be 
valid. 
8. All tests should be given with a view to reveal 
something that can be used as a basis for improving in- 
struction. If they cannot be made to do this or if the 
information revealed is not so utilized, the time spent in 
giving the tests might rather be spent in some other way. 
To quote Monroe, “The correction of defects revealed by 
the test is the culmination of the preceding steps. It is in 
this step that the value of standardized tests is realized. 
Without this step standardized tests become mere ‘play- 
things’ and their use cannot be justified.” t 
Speed and accuracy tests—Tests of speed and accu- 
racy are given primarily for the purpose of discovering 
the speed and accuracy with which pupils can complete 
a given task. The Courtis Standard Research Test in 
Arithmetic; The Gettysburg Edition of the Ayres’s 
Handwriting Scale; and the Monroe’s Standardized 
Silent Reading Test are good examples of this type of 
test. 
By an intelligent use of such tests a superintendent 
can better compare the results obtained in his school 
system with those obtained in other systems, and deter- 
mine whether a given teacher is obtaining the results 
that are being obtained by other teachers in his system. 
Likewise teachers can determine their own results by 
comparing the scores of their classes with those of other 
classes and with the standard scores. 
The tests may also be used as a direct incentive. A 
test that is to be repeated from time to time can usually 
+ Walter S. Monroe, Measuring the Results of Teaching, p. 282. 
 
-P-A-G-E-287
  MEASUREMENTS AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 271 
be made to stimulate and motivate the daily work of a 
class. This may be accomplished by explaining the test 
and its object to the pupils and by showing them where 
they stand in comparison with other pupils. Often it 
can be accomplished through a keen and wholesome 
group or class rivalry. 
Again, the tests may be used as an administrative 
device to show a given teacher where she stands. This 
can be done best by having the various class scores ar- 
ranged on a sheet of paper in tabular form so that they 
can be readily compared. Such a table may also be 
placed on a blackboard for comparison and discussion at 
a teachers’ meeting. 
Diagnostic tests—The purpose of a diagnostic test 
is to discover particular difficulties or particular phases 
of a subject in which pupils are weak. The Cleveland- 
Survey Arithmetic Tests, the Freeman Handwriting Scale, 
and Charters Diagnostic Test in Language and Grammar 
are examples of this type of test. The chief value of a 
diagnostic test consists in its usefulness as an aid to the 
teacher in guiding the work of her pupils. By revealing 
the particular difficulties that pupils encounter, such a 
test enables a teacher to place the emphasis in teaching 
where it is most needed and in this way makes possible 
more direct help and better economy of time. 
General intelligence tests—General intelligence tests 
seek to discover various abilities or groups of abilities, or 
the lack of these abilities, with a view to determine such 
factors as feeble-mindedness, promotion of pupils in 
schools and colleges, probable success in college or in 
certain occupations, and special aptitudes. Examples 
of these tests are the Binet-Simon Scale, the Freeman-
-P-A-G-E-288
272 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
Rugg Intelligence Test, the Indiana University Intelli- 
gence Scale, the Terman Group Test of Mental Ability, 
and the United States Army Test Alpha. 
Intelligence tests are now used in county and state- 
wide surveys, in high schools, and in some of the leading 
universities. By their use it is possible to determine 
various abilities and capacities with reasonable accuracy 
and in a very short time. It should be understood, how- 
ever, that there is a difference in the accuracy of results 
obtained by the testing of groups and of individuals. 
Class scores and average results of large groups may be 
obtained quite accurately with tests that are by no means 
perfect or reliable as an instrument for measuring the 
general intelligence or capacity of a particular pupil or 
person. The general intelligence of an individual is de- 
pendent on an innunmerable variety of experiences and 
interrelated factors, and is too complex a thing to be 
measured accurately with any kind of a test or series of 
tests. This does not minimize the usefulness of a test 
for group testing, but calls attention to a fact that should 
not be overlooked on the side of the individual. In the 
words of Woodrow, “Group tests cannot take the place of 
individual examinations. The idea is that they can be 
made sufficiently accurate for rapid surveys to determine 
those who should be tested individually.” 1 
The use of standardized tests in classifying pupils— 
In recent years much has been said about the use of 
standardized tests in grading, promoting and classifying 
pupils according to their abilities and capacities. We 
now have a vast and increasing amount of literature on 
* Herbert Woodrow, Brightness and Dullness in Children, J. B. Lippin- 
cott Co., p. 40.
-P-A-G-E-289
  MEASUREMENTS AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 273 
this subject, much of which at present is radical and 
confusing, but which as a whole will in time, no doubt, 
leave its precipitate of good. 
There is no doubt that standardized tests and scales, 
if used intelligently, are a valuable aid in determining 
the promotion and classification of pupils (where pro- 
motions and classifications are to be made), but the 
wisdom of basing promotion and classification in the 
more intangible subjects solely on the results of such 
tests is very questionable. There are too many impor- 
tant and determining factors that contribute to success 
or failure in school work which cannot be determined by 
these tests. Among them are the following: (1) health 
or physical condition, (2) home environment, (3) regu- 
larity of attendance, (4) determination, (5) persever- 
ance, (6) endurance, (7) temperament, and (8) attitude. 
A more reliable measure of a pupil’s ability may be ob- 
tained from his daily class grades, together with the esti- 
mate of the teacher (who knows something about his 
physical condition, home environment, habits, and other 
contributory factors), plus the results of term or semester 
examinations and an occasional standardized test. Such 
a combination of results is a safer guide to a pupil’s 
ability and capacity than the results of a single test or 
series of tests. 
No sane person believes in tolerating an arrangement 
or scheme of classification that will prevent or retard 
the progress of the brighter pupils if it can be prevented 
without as much or more injustice, to others. But there 
is more involved in the solution of this problem than 
mere testing and placing of pupils. It is a many-sided 
question and one that can often be met only by a choice
-P-A-G-E-290
  274 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
between two or more evils. Practical school administra- 
tors will continue to be governed largely by such imme- 
diate and ever-present factors as economy, available 
facilities, practicability, and greatest good for the greatest 
number. It has already been pointed out in a previous 
chapter that in large school systems much can be done 
in the way of classification and special promotions that 
would be unwise and impractical if not impossible in a 
smaller system. And it should be borne in mind that 
over seventy-five per cent of all schools belong to the 
smaller system, where there is one teacher for one or more 
grades. But, the advisability of frequent re-classification 
and special promotions in any public school system is 
not yet determined. There is much to be said on the 
other side of this question. We are beginning to ask such 
questions as the following: 
1. Is it desirable to promote the exceptional or gifted 
pupil of a class before the end of the semester or before 
the end of the school year? 
2. Is exceptional ability or brightness among pupils 
sufficiently uniform and constant to warrant any scheme 
of definite or exact classification during the semester or 
during the school year? 
8. Is it fair to the less gifted pupils to be separated 
from the brighter ones and deprived of the interest, en- 
thusiasm, and superior recitation work made possible by 
the brighter pupils? Do we advocate such a method of 
classification for development and progress in life outside 
of school? | 
4, What are we to do in the average smaller school 
system with a pupil who is bright in English, mediocre 
in geography, and dull in arithmetic; with a pupil who
-P-A-G-E-291
  MEASUREMENTS AND STANDARDIZED TESTS 275 
is greatly interested and very apt in certain phases of 
English and arithmetic, but uninterested and poor in 
other phases of the subjects? 
5. Is the development of general ability and capacity 
contemporaneous and coextensive with achievement in 
one or a few subjects? Are not those pupils who make 
the best grades in their daily lessons often the very ones 
who are below average in such qualities as alertness, 
quickness of thought and action, discretion, tact, refine- 
ment of manners, codperation in group activities, initia- 
tive, and leadership? Is it wise to promote pupils who 
are deficient or below average in these qualities to higher 
grades than those attained by the average pupil who may 
not be so apt or bright in certain book knowledge of one 
or a few subjects? 
6. Is it advisable to classify pupils according to their 
I.Q.’s of brightness and disregard chronological, anatomi- 
cal, and psychological age? 
7. How much of the development of a child or youth is 
due to the few hours of regular class work received dur- 
ing five days of the week, and how much of it is due to 
all that he comes in contact with during the remainder 
of the time? Would it not be better to devote more 
attention to a closer codperation with the home concern- 
ing the guidance and activities of children outside of 
school than to a more refined classification in school? 
8. What are we to do upon graduation with the few 
exceptional pupils who by repeated special promotions 
can go through the grades and high school in much less 
time than the average pupil? Is it advisable to gradu- 
ate them from high school before the age of fifteen? 
9. Would it not be as profitable and more practical 
 
-P-A-G-E-292
    276 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
in the average school to keep the pupils of a given grade 
or class together until the end of the semester or the 
end of the year by using a certain amount of regular 
subject-matter as a basis with which to hold them to- 
gether, and provide additional work for those who can do 
more? 
10. Would it not be better to concern ourselves more 
about making our daily programs sufficiently flexible and 
extensive to take care of all pupils within a reasonable 
range of abilities and to keep them all busy at something 
worth while than to be forever testing to determine just 
where each one stands at a given time? 
11. Is it possible to devise a general intelligence test 
that is sufficiently representative of all that goes to make 
up general intelligence and at the same time practicable?

  CHAPTER XVIII 
SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS 
Schools should provide for social development of 
pupils—The social demands of the age have introduced 
many new responsibilities and obligations which can- 
not be ignored by school superintendents and principals, 
but must be considered as educational problems. Suc- 
cess in modern industrial, business, and professional life 
calls for various social qualifications that are developed 
only by mingling with others and by taking an active 
part in social affairs. It is important therefore that 
those in charge of the education of our youth recognize 
the need of preparing young people to meet present-day 
social requirements. 
Schools should make provisions for a reasonable 
amount of wholesome social recreation, and an opportu- 
nity should be given all children for social development, 
under proper guidance. Carefully controlled and well- 
directed class and school parties, receptions, banquets, 
and other social gatherings for amusement or entertain- 
ment may be made to supply wholesome recreation, 
and if kept in proper relation to the regular work and 
the main purpose of the school, may be made an impor- 
tant element in the training of young people. In these 
gatherings pupils learn much and gain many experiences 
that will be valuable to them in later life. 
278
-P-A-G-E-295
  SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS 279 
Neglected social development in past—Our schools in 
the past have generally been very neglectful in teaching 
young people etiquette and decorum. Many a serious- 
minded and well-meaning pupil has gone through high 
school and has graduated with honors, without learning 
even the fundamentals of good etiquette and social re- 
quirements in polite society. 
Speaking of the results of our past attempts to prohibit 
and restrict social activities in high schools, Jesse B. 
Davis, in his contribution to The Modern High School, 
by Johnson and others, says: “Those who entered from 
homes without social advantages were turned out as 
socially deficient as when they entered. Those who had 
outside opportunities for social development were fortu- 
nate, but they could not exercise their powers legiti- 
mately within the school except in very limited ways. 
The faithful bookworm, who upon his graduation was 
proclaimed valedictorian of his class, too often proved 
to be a failure in the world outside. On the other hand, 
and to the surprise and chagrin of his instructors, the 
boy who was the leader of every scheme of outlawry 
and the plotter of every prank during his school career, 
and who may have been expelled from school because of 
his ability to lead others into mischief, became a great 
and successful organizer and leader of men in the field 
of business. Both the narrowly developed valedictorian 
and the outlaw were cheated out of a part of their right- 
ful education. The social nature of the one should have 
been drawn out so that he might have become socially 
efficient, and the crude powers of the other should have 
been trained coérdinately with his intellectual attain- 
ment.”

280 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
It is necessary, of course, to restrict and limit the social 
activities of pupils and to guard against over-indulgence 
in social affairs. Too many social activities are detri- 
mental to good school work as well as to the health of 
the pupil, since they demand too much of his attention 
and energy. School authorities and parents or guardians 
should see to it, therefore, that social activities are not 
too numerous. During the week, especially, should these 
activities be restricted for the good ‘of the pupil’s health 
and the regular school work. 
It is well for an inexperienced superintendent to out- 
line, with the help of his principal, a tentative general 
plan or social program for the school year, and to have 
this plan considered and approved by the parent-teacher 
association and the board of education. Such a program 
will be helpful to the superintendent in regulating and 
controlling social activities and will serve to prevent 
misunderstandings. 
Faculty advisors, advisory boards and councils— 
Every high-school class or society should have a faculty 
advisor, and every school affair should be chaperoned, 
whether in the school or elsewhere. In some high 
schools, and especially in larger ones, it is customary to 
have advisory boards consisting of two faculty mem- 
bers and two or more pupils, including the class president 
and secretary, and the high school principal as an ex- 
officio member. The faculty members are chosen by 
the pupils and the principal and approved by the superin- 
tendent. The superintendent and faculty members of 
the various advisory boards act as an advisory council 
to consider and outline the general policy for the school. 
In Anita one faculty advisor is chosen for each high  
-P-A-G-E-297
  SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS 281 
school class by the superintendent, high school principal, 
class president, and class secretary. The principal and 
the faculty advisor, class president, and class secretary 
act as an advisory board for that class. The superin- 
tendent, principal, and various faculty advisors consti- 
tute an advisory council. This council meets from time 
to time or as occasions demand to consider the general 
social policy of the school, or any special matters. 
In this way the social policy and activities can be con- 
trolled by the superintendent and the principal. This is 
often quite necessary since some teachers are not suited 
or qualified to serve as class advisors and chaperons in 
social affairs. If the selection of the faculty advisors 
is left entirely to the pupils they may select the teacher. 
who is most socially inclined, but least experienced and 
least capable to act as advisor and chaperon. Those 
chosen as faculty advisors are chosen as far as possible 
because of their interest and fitness for the work. They 
are instructed to act in an advisory way, helping to make 
plans, and guiding the members of the class at their 
meetings. 
Students are required at all meetings to treat their ad- 
visor respectfully and courteously. They are made to 
realize that she is giving her time and effort for their 
enjoyment, and that it is the duty of every member to 
make it as pleasant for her as possible. The Freshmen 
and Sophomores are allowed to have four social class 
functions each during the school year, the Juniors five, 
and the Seniors six, including a Junior-Senior Banquet. 
Student organizations—The formation of a few or- 
ganizations, such as a literary society, music club, and 
athletic association will do much to increase the interest 
 
-P-A-G-E-298
  282 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
of high school pupils and to promote a good school spirit. 
In many high schools all students are required to take 
an active part in literary-society work, debating work, 
or music work. 
In organizing a debating, literary, or music club the 
following principles should be kept in mind: 
1. Every student organization should be subject to the 
approval of and under the control of the principal and 
the superintendent. 
2. Every organization should be required to have a 
faculty advisor, chosen by the principal and the organi- 
zation, and subject to the approval of the superintendent, 
or appointed by the principal and the superintendent. 
This should be a person who is interested in the particular 
work and qualified to give helpful suggestions and in- 
structive criticism. In case of debating and other liter- 
ary activities she should aid in the selection of suitable 
questions for debate, topics for papers, readings, etc. 
She should know where to find helpful reference material 
and how to direct pupils in methods of preparation and 
presentation. 
3. Arrangements should be made for a suitable place 
to meet, and a regular time schedule for study and meet- 
ings should be worked out. If this is not done good 
results are not likely to be obtained. 
4, If the greatest educational value is to be derived 
from these activities, the members should be given as 
much freedom as possible under wise and careful 
guidance. 
5. In case of debating and declamatory contests with 
other schools, all contestants should be required to adhere 
strictly to the principles of fair play. They should be
-P-A-G-E-299
  SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS 283 
taught how to be courteous under all conditions, how to 
take defeat gracefully, how to entertain others, and how 
to be entertained. 
6. In order to be eligible to class offices or contests 
between schools a pupil should be doing creditable work. 
7. All entertainments undertaken by student organi- 
zations should be approved by the principal and superin- 
_ tendent. 
8. It is generally held by experienced superintendents 
that class organizations should not be encouraged below 
the junior year in the high school. 
Athletics—Athletics is now an integral function of 
most high schools, and a good superintendent will strive 
to promote an interest in good, clean athletics. Where 
the school is not large enough to have a regular athletic 
director, he will see to it that some member of the teach- 
ing staff employed is able to direct or coach athletics. 
To be a good athletic director it is not enough to under- 
stand the team work of one ora few games. The director 
or coach should be a person who has a general knowl- 
edge of the field of physical education, who understands 
boys and girls, and who is able to hold their respect and 
confidence. 
Among the benefits derived from well-directed organ- 
ized athletics, according to leading educators, are the 
following: 
1. It helps to promote and maintain a good school 
spirit. 
2. It promotes physical development and good health. 
3. It advertises the school and prevents it from becom- 
ing isolated. 
4, It teaches perseverance. 
 
-P-A-G-E-300
284 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
5. It affords training in intense application and vigor- 
ous exertion. 
6. It develops courage. 
7. It affords training in alertness and concentration. 
8. It develops self-control. 
9. It teaches self-sacrifice. 
10. It teaches codperation and team work. 
11. It teaches obedience to law and respect for the 
rights of others. 
12. It promotes a spirit of fair play and square deal. 
High school athletics may be and often are overdone, 
especially where they seek to glorify the school by devel- 
oping a few experts. In smaller schools, especially, it 
should not be made too spectacular, and should not give 
too much time and attention to a limited few. Football, 
basketball, baseball, and track work, elective on the part 
of the pupils, should not take the place of physical educa- 
tion or training intended primarily for the correction and 
development of all children. 
In promoting athletics the following principles and 
rules will be found helpful, especially by superintendents 
who are new in the field: 
1. Athletics should be directly in charge of the in- 
structor chosen for that work, but should at all times re- 
main under the control of the superintendent. In prac- 
tice or training for athletics the coach or director should 
have the same authority over those in training as would 
be proper in regular class work under regular instructors. 
Under careful direction he should, from the beginning, 
place as much responsibility as possible on those in train- 
ing in order to prepare them for exercising a voice in the 
administration and management of games and contests. 
 
-P-A-G-E-301
  SOCIAL ACTIVITIES AND STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS 285 
2. All contracts for games and contests with other 
schools should be strictly in accordance with rules and 
regulations and should be subject to the approval of the 
superintendent. 
8. Every candidate for training should undergo a medi- 
cal and physical examination before beginning to 
practice. 
4. No pupil should be allowed to participate in any 
inter-scholastic games unless his academic work is up to 
the required standard, and without the consent of his par- 
ents or guardian. 
5. The superintendent should have general direction 
of the use of the gymnasium. Where the gymnasium is 
used for boys’ and girls’ athletics and for other physical 
training classes, a program should be carefully worked 
out by the superintendent and those in charge of the 
various athletic groups or classes. 
6. Every athletic association should prepare carefully 
worded articles and rules to be adopted and adhered to 
by all. ; 
The following are the articles and rules adopted by the 
Anita High School Athletic Association: 
Aim and Purpose of the Association: 
We, the young men of Anita High School, for the pur- 
pose of furthering our interscholastic athletics along the 
lines of better sportsmanship, and conducting them upon 
sound business principles, form ourselves into a body

CHAPTER XIX 
THE LOCAL PRESS AND THE SCHOOL PAPER 
Educational publicity—A good school administrator 
will do all he can to interest the general public in the 
schools of the community. He will realize that unless 
the public shows an interest in the schools it is not likely 
that the children will become greatly interested. 
The best way to create a general interest in the schools 
of a community is to keep parents and citizens well in- 
formed about school activities. And this can best be 
done through the columns of the press. Changes in or- 
ganization and administration, and information concern- 
ing courses of study, enrolment and classification are 
generally of interest to the public, and should be pub- 
lished in the local newspaper from time to time. A pro- 
gressive school administrator will also keep his commu- 
nity informed as to the standing of the schools with 
respect to all important matters, and will show compari- 
sons with other schools. A school paper is an excellent 
medium for news pertaining to athletics, entertainments 
and social functions, class and group activities. But 
where a school paper cannot be had, a reasonable amount 
of space should be given to these activities in the local 
newspaper. 
The business of the schools is the biggest business in 
the world. The education of the boys and girls of a 
289  
-P-A-G-E-306
  290 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
community is of more importance than the product of 
any business concern. The product of the schools, like 
that of a business establishment, must be sold to the 
people of the community, and to be sold it must be adver- 
tised. But the schools, instead of being the best adver- 
tised, are often the most poorly advertised. 
Relation with the local editor—The local editor of a 
community, as a rule, is a man of considerable influence 
and power to do good. A new superintendent should, 
so far as possible, and as soon as possible, seek an under- 
standing with him to have certain school notes or news 
printed each week or from time to time. He should be 
tactful and careful in his dealings with the editor and 
seek to supply him with such news as he may desire, 
rather than attempt to dictate to him what he should 
publish. It is safe to say that generally the editor of a 
smaller community knows better than a new school man 
what his readers most desire to know and what should 
be published. From this it does not follow that a super- 
intendent should not exercise his influence in bringing 
about needed changes or improvements that may be un- 
appreciated or opposed by certain citizens, but unless he 
can do this by first gaining the approval of the editor he 
will get nowhere. 
The superintendent should see to it that all school 
notes or news items are creditable. They should be care- 
fully prepared and should reach the editor’s desk in due 
time. If this is done, editors will, as a rule, be glad to 
receive them. The preparation of various news items 
may well be assigned to some English class, under the 
supervision of a good English teacher, the principal, or
-P-A-G-E-307
  THE LOCAL PRESS AND THE SCHOOL PAPER 291 
the superintendent. All school notes, however, should 
be submitted to the superintendent for his approval. 
The School Paper 
Facts to be considered in establishing a school paper 
—School papers issued weekly, by-weekly, or monthly 
are now not uncommon, even in smaller school systems; 
and if properly directed can be made an excellent means 
for motivation and vitalizing English work, promoting 
a good school spirit, and keeping the community well 
informed about the schools. 
Before starting a school paper in a community that has 
had no previous experience in the matter it will be well 
to collect a number of different school papers and exam- 
ine them with regard to content, arrangement of material, 
relative amount of space given to advertising, and other 
general characteristics. Not all school papers should be 
copied after, however, for in some instances they are 
still more of a plaything than anything else. A school 
paper consisting largely of a conglomeration of short 
items of petty gossip and silly personal references ar- 
ranged in cataloged form, is no credit to a school. Such 
papers soon become monotonous and afford little or no 
opportunity for developing skill in writing. 
The size of the paper, the number of issues per school 
year, and the cost of printing should be determined be- 
fore definite plans are made. The size and the number 
of issues will probably be governed largely by the size of 
the school, the advertising and subscribers that can be 
secured, and the amount of talent available for produc- 
 
-P-A-G-E-308
  292 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
ing a paper. In communities that cannot afford a school 
press arrangements can often be made with the local 
editor for the printing of a small school paper, or with 
some printing establishment in a nearby city. Before 
making definite plans it will be well also to talk the 
matter over with a number of the leading business men 
of the town, in order to determine their attitude toward 
such an undertaking, and their opinion concerning the 
probability of getting the necessary advertising. If 
after a preliminary survey the undertaking seems advis- 
able an effort should be made on the part of the entire 
faculty to awaken a live interest among the pupils. 
The staff—A definite organization with officers and 
editors should be formed. The staff should consist of a 
business manager, an advertising manager, a subscrip- 
tion manager, an editor-in-chief, and an assistant editor. 
Besides these there may be editors for the various de- 
partments of the paper such as society editor, literary 
editor, athletic editor, and joke editor. In smaller school 
systems both the elementary and the high school pupils 
should have an active part in the production of the 
paper, and the various grade rooms and high school de- 
partments should have their reporters. 
The pupils should be made to feel that the paper is to 
be theirs, that it is to be produced by them, and that 
they are responsible for its success. They should, as far 
as seems advisable, have a voice in the selection or elec- 
tion of the members on the staff, and when the staff has 
been formed they should be given all the freedom con- 
sistent with their ability and the production of a good 
paper. The formation of the first staff, however, should 
be carefully supervised and controlled, for upon it de-
-P-A-G-E-309
  THE LOCAL PRESS AND THE SCHOOL PAPER 293 
pends the success of the paper. Popular but weak stu- 
dents should not be allowed to have important positions 
on the staff. 
In a school where a paper is put out for the first time, 
and until it becomes fairly well established, it will be well 
for the superintendent and the principal to control the en- 
tire project. All the work should be subject to their super- 
vision and approval. The business, advertising, and sub- 
scription managers should be appointed by the superin- 
tendent and the principal. They should be intelligent and 
industrious students, preferably upper classmen with 
aptitude for business affairs, and with their school work 
of such a standing that they can afford to devote some 
of their time to the school paper. The election of editors 
may be left to the high school with provisions that the 
editor-in-chief be a senior student, and that all candi- 
dates for editors meet the approval of the superintendent 
and the principal. 
When all necessary arrangements have been made and 
a working staff has been formed, the entire staff should 
make a vigorous but well-planned campaign for subscrip- 
tions, getting as many subscribers as possible from the 
faculty, student body, alumni, and citizens. 
A reasonable rate should be established for advertis- 
ing and there should be no rate cutting. In deciding on 
the rate per inch it will be well to consult the editor of 
the local paper and other business men. The business 
and advertising manager, under the directions of the 
superintendent or some faculty advisor, should systemati- 
cally canvass the merchants and professional men for 
advertising. In selling advertising for the first time it 
will be well to have a dummy made, ruled with columns
-P-A-G-E-310
  294 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
in which the number of inches and the names of those 
purchasing the space can be indicated. Those selling the 
advertising should aim to sell the space, wherever pos- 
sible, for the entire school year. With a certain amount 
of advertising promised for the year the paper may be 
given free. In many instances it will be necessary to 
call a second time for the ads after they have been 
written. It is evident, of course, that the greater the 
number of subscriptions sold or the amount of money 
collected for subscriptions the smaller will need be the 
proportion of advertising matter to make the paper self- 
supporting. 
Record keeping—In a well-bound book a complete 
record should be kept of all expenditures and receipts. 
Some member of the staff should be responsible for the 
keeping of these records, under the direction of a faculty 
member. The names and addresses of all subscribers 
should be neatly arranged in alphabetical order. The 
pages of the book should be ruled with columns in which 
each subscriber can be credited, immediately after his 
name with the amount of his subscription when it is 
paid. Separate lists may be made for pupils, for others 
living in town, and for out-of-town subscribers. Another 
list may be made for concerns and individuals purchasing 
advertising. In connection with these should be indi- 
cated, in columns or otherwise, the date, the number of 
inches purchased, and the payments made. A separate 
account should be opened with the printer. 
The news—The paper should contain news of the work 
and activities of the various grades and departments of 
the schools. It should contain accounts of unique class 
programs, recitations, and experiments; athletic activi-
-P-A-G-E-311
  THE LOCAL PRESS AND THE SCHOOL PAPER 295 
ties; social affairs and entertainments; debating and 
declamatory work; additions of new courses or changes 
in the regular program. There should be a proper bal- 
ance of short editorials, society and personal notes, verse, 
and wholesome humor and jokes. 
If the work is properly motivated and directed, pupils 
will as a rule be eager to anticipate in contributing some- 
thing to the paper. They like to see their work and their 
names in print, and their parents, guardians, and friends 
are interested in their contributions, or anything concern- 
ing them. 
The gathering and writing of all news should be care- 
fully and accurately done. Nothing but clear English— 
accurate expressions and well-formed sentences—should 
be accepted. If this standard is adhered to, teachers 
will find the school paper a valuable aid in the teaching 
of English composition. In the upper grades and high 
school short editorials and compositions may be written 
by the entire class with a view to having one or more 
of the best productions selected for the paper. Such a 
method will afford wholesome competition and a live 
interest in a real undertaking. 
Suggestions for improvements—There are many 
things to learn in connections with a good school paper, 
and a live staff will make improvements as they gain in 
experience. After the first issue has been received it will 
be well to invite the local editor to talk to the high school 
concerning the paper and to suggest ways and means for 
improvement. Where the editor cannot be induced to 
come to the school building, the chief members of the 
staff may call on him by appointment to get his opinion 
of the paper and his suggestions for improvements.

view to improve their own, a staff will be able to obtain 
many excellent ideas and suggestions for improvement.

  CHAPTER XX 
GRADUATION EXERCISES AND CLOSING ACTIVITIES 
Extra duties and responsibilities—The last two or 
three weeks of the school year are usually very busy ones 
for both teachers and administrators. At this time there 
are many extra school activities that interfere more or 
less with the regular work and call for special attention, 
direction, and supervision. It is near the end of the 
school year also that pupils are most likely to become 
restless and careless about their work, and that the in- 
corrigible. ones are most likely to cause disturbances. 
Parents and patrons of the school, on the other hand, 
are at this time likely to be most exacting in their 
demands. 
Importance of careful planning—Success in school, as 
in life outside of school, is not measured by the begin- 
ning but by the results shown in the end. Members of 
the graduating class, as well as their parents and friends, 
anxiously look forward to the day of graduation. This 
is an important occasion both for the school and the com- 
munity. The success of the school is judged by the qual- 
ity and success of its graduates who will now go to 
college and out in the world to demonstrate what the 
training and influence of the local school is worth. In 
smaller places, especially, graduating exercises are gener- 
ally thought of as something that typifies or demonstrates 
297
-P-A-G-E-314
  298 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
the development and accomplishments of the pupils. If 
these exercises are not well prepared, planned, and di- 
rected they are likely to react unfavorably on the instruc- 
tion and management of the schools. 
A wise superintendent will see to it that a careful 
checking is made at the end of the first semester on the 
credits and standing of all-pupils who expect to gradu- 
ate, and will not allow anyone to make preparations for 
graduation until it is reasonably certain that he will 
have the required number of credits at the end of the 
year. He will begin early in the second semester to 
check up on matters pertaining to graduation and the 
closing of the year’s work. If he is inexperienced and is 
new in the community, he will find out from the principal 
or senior class members just what was done during previ- 
ous years, and will have a clear understanding with his 
board concerning any changes or new plans that he may 
wish to introduce. 
Dress—In some communities, and especially in some 
of the smaller ones, there is a tendency to make too much 
of dress for graduation. Often it becomes a matter of 
competitive ostentation on the part of a few, which has 
a humiliating effect on others. The use of showy, elabo- 
ate, and expensive gowns, or formal evening dress for 
this purpose should be discouraged. The circumstances 
and welfare of the class as a whole, rather than that of 
individuals should be considered. Anything else shows 
a lack of regard for others and a poor class spirit. Nor 
is it as a rule a difficult matter to convince the majority 
of a class that plain, appropriate attire is preferable to 
elaborate and expensive dress for graduation, The fault 
more often lies with the parents.
-P-A-G-E-315
GRADUATION EXERCISES 299 
It may not be advisable for a superintendent or a prin- 
cipal to take formal action to regulate or restrict the 
expenditure of the members of the graduation class, but 
the superintendent through his faculty, board, parent- 
teacher association, and other suitable agencies should 
exercise his influence to bring about a sensible and whole- 
some sentiment concerning the matter. 
The following extracts are taken from a manual put 
out by the State Department of Public Instruction of 
New Jersey: 
“When the elaboration and extension of graduating 
exercises lead a girl to think that she must have more 
than one dress in order to be properly graduated, the 
question is often a serious one. It is not necessary that 
a girl’s clothing should be cheap or inappropriate, but 
it should be such that no other pupil need be made to 
feel embarrassment because of a less expensive dress. 
. . . The growing practice of having the pupils in the 
domestic art classes design and make their own gradua- 
tion dresses is significant of the sentiment in some of the 
larger high schools.” + 
The use of the cap and gown which was originally a 
distinct college and university custom seems to be grow- 
ing in favor in the larger schools of certain sections of 
the country. In city school systems where there is a wide 
disparity in social standing of pupils and financial ability 
of parents this is a democratic and economic way of han- 
dling the situation. In smaller school systems, however, 
it is not customary and is not generally considered 
advisable.

  300 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
The exercises—There is always a tendency on the part 
of the smaller school to imitate the large schools and col- 
leges, and to make the graduating exercises more elabo- 
rate and expensive than the financial circumstances of 
some of the parents warrant. 
A great variety of possible and appropriate exercises 
might be given near the end of the school year or at a 
graduation. The program as a whole should seek to 
inspire pupils and promote a good school spirit, but un- 
necessary ostentation and expense should be discouraged. 
To quote from the Indiana Manual with Course of 
Study, “Graduating exercises may be made to contribute 
to a better school sentiment in the community where 
held, and should be so conducted as to inspire the gradu- 
ates to do higher work and encourage the pupils in the 
lower grades to complete the course, but simplicity in 
dress and in all matters pertaining to the commencement 
should be observed.” 2 
It is common to have class parties and a Junior-Senior 
banquet near the end of the school year. Class Day 
Exercises; Class Plays; Baccalaureate Services, held in 
church; Commencement Addresses, given by noted 
speakers or educators; and Glee Club and Orchestra 
Music are common throughout the country. A very 
appropriate and less expensive program may consist of 
an exhibition of what pupils can do in music, essay writ- 
ing, reading, typewriting, laboratory work (experiments 
performed and explained), and other expressive activi- 
ties that represent the work of the school.

Closing up the regular school work—In an endeavor 
to take care of daily routine matters and the various out- 
side activities, attention to the closing of the regular 
school work of the year must not be neglected. Since 
final reports and various other duties cannot be com- 
pleted before the end of the school year, this work should 
be carefully planned and outlined in advance. When 
the regular work is over certain teachers (especially cer- 
tain ones of those who do not expect to return the fol- 
lowing year, or who may not have been reélected) are 
likely to be careless and indifferent about closing up 
their work. 
The following Notice to Teachers will serve to point
-P-A-G-E-324
  
308 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
out various matters that need attention at the end of 
the year. Copies of such a notice, prepared in advance, 
and handed to teachers several days before the closing 
of schools will prove helpful to both teachers and 
administrators. 
Notice to Teachers: 
1. In the grades regular school work should be con- 
tinued until dismissal time on Thursday afternoon, May 
18, excepting by permission of or with the approval of 
the superintendent. 
2. Grade teachers should have their six-week cards 
filled in by ten o’clock, May 19, and be ready to help 
put these grades on the permanent cards so that the 
children can get their reports on Friday afternoon. An- 
nounce a definite time during which children are to come 
for their report cards in the afternoon. 
3. High school teachers should have their final grades 
on grade sheets by ten o’clock May 19, and be ready 
to help record these grades on permanent record cards. 
4. Make a complete written statement concerning all 
pupils who are in arrear in one or more subjects. Assign 
such pupils definite work to be done during the summer 
months, if by so doing they can be promoted to the next 
grade or, in case of departmentalized work, earn a credit 
in the subject. Hand this statement and copy of the 
assignment into the office before twelve o’clock, May 
18. (This applies to both grade and high school 
teachers. ) 
5. Return to the office (or proper place or person) any 
reference material loaned which does not regularly be- 
long in your room, 
 
-P-A-G-E-325
  GRADUATION EXERCISES 309 
6. Have all materials in or on your desk, book-racks, 
cases, cupboards, etc., orderly arranged before the eve- 
ning of May 19. 
7. Complete your class register and turn it in to the 
office before the evening of May 19. 
8. Prepare and submit a complete inventory of equip- 
ment belonging to your room, including pictures and 
movable articles of furniture. 
9. Report anything that in your estimation needs at- 
tention before the beginning of next school year. 
10. Make any suggestions for improvement on the 
course of study, the daily program, text books, ete. which 
you think will be helpful to the administration. 
11. Label your key or keys and return them to the 
office before the evening of May 19. (Small shipping 
tags may be obtained at the office for this purpose.) 
12. When you have fulfilled the above requirements 
obtain at the office a statement showing that your work 
has been completed in a satisfactory manner. Present 
this statement to the clerk when you call for your salary 
warrant. 
Summary of Things to Be Kept in Mind 
1. Checking on Credits. See to it that a careful check- 
ing is made at the end of the first semester on the credits 
and standing of all pupils who expect to graduate. 
2. Plan Early. Begin early to plan the various activi- 
ties and duties connected with the graduation and clos- 
ing of the year’s work. 
8. Find Out How Things Were Done in Previous 
 
-P-A-G-E-326
  310 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
Years. A superintendent who is new in the community 
should not hesitate to inquire of his principal, teachers, 
or members of the senior class concerning customs and 
methods of procedure in previous years. 
4, Consult Board Concerning Important Changes. A 
superintendent should have a clear understanding with 
his board concerning any important changes or new plans 
that he may wish to introduce. 
5. Plan Cost and Methods of Financing Activities. 
The cost of’all special activities should, as far as possible, 
be determined in advance, and methods of financing these 
activities should be carefully planned. 
6. Purchasing Pins or Rings and Invitations. Instruct 
the graduating class with respect to the purchasing of 
pins or rings and invitations. If it is customary and if 
it seems advisable to obtain these through local dealers, 
it is well to have a committee of two or three appointed 
by the class to call on the dealers in advance, so that they 
can supply themselves with catalogs, samples, and price 
lists. If there are two or more dealers in the town who 
handle such articles, all should be given an opportunity 
to show samples and submit prices. Other things being 
approximately equal it is always well to patronize home 
dealers. 
7. Engaging a Coach for Senior Play. Where it is cus- 
tomary or necessary to employ an out-of-town person to 
coach the senior class play, this should be attended to 
early in the second semester so that a qualified person 
may be secured and a suitable time agreed upon for 
training. If there is some one in town who is well quali- 
fied and willing to do this work, it is usually possible to
-P-A-G-E-327
  GRADUATION EXERCISES 311 
make more satisfactory arrangements with such a person. 
Other things being equal local talent is also less costly 
since there is no transportation charge included. 
8. Engaging a Speaker. If a speaker is to be engaged 
for the commencement or graduating address, this should 
be done early in the second semester and may be done 
early in the year. Unless there is an establishd precedent 
for taking care of this matter, it should be considered 
at a regular meeting of the board. Where there are ca- 
pable and experienced men on the board they are often 
better prepared to secure a suitable speaker than the 
superintendent. Care should be exercised, however, to 
secure a capable man. Personal favoritism and politics 
should not be allowed to govern the choice or decision. 
9. Baccalaureate Services. It is customary to have 
the baccalaureate sermon given by a local minister and 
to have the services in a local church on the Sunday 
preceding the graduation. Arrangements for this should 
also be made several weeks in advance. Where there 
are two or more local ministers in the town or village it is 
well that all be given an opportunity to take turns in 
order that all the churches may be represented in a term 
of years. 
10. Dress. Elaborate and expensive dress for gradua- 
tion should be discouraged. Where there is a tendency 
to make too much of dress on this occasion, the super- 
intendent should seek to bring about a wholesome desire 
for less elaborate and more appropriate attire. This 
he should not attempt to do by formal action or dicta- - 
torial methods, but by helping the community to realize 
what is most suitable and appropriate for the occasion.
-P-A-G-E-328
    
312 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
It may be done through the influence of the faculty, 
school board, parent-teacher association, and other suit- 
able agencies. 
11. Music for Graduation. Where ‘there is sufficient 
musical talent in the school it is always preferable to 
have the music for graduating activities furnished by the 
pupils of the school. Arrangements for this should also 
be made early in janie to allow plenty of time for neces- 
sary drill and preparation of suitable numbers. 
12. Presentation Address. In smaller schools it is 
proper and quite common for the superintendent to pre- 
sent the class at graduation. In larger school systems 
this is more properly the duty of the principal. Those 
of little or no experience in the matter should carefully 
prepare a few well-thought-out and appropriate remarks 
for this occasion. Do not put this matter off until the 
day before graduation. It is highly probably that you 
will not find time then, and that your address will be 
only fair or mediocre if not poor, where it might have 
been excellent. 
13. Engaging Hall or Theatre. Where the class play 
and graduating exercises are to be held in the town or 
village hall or theatre, arrangements for this should be 
made a number of weeks in advance so that the date may 
not conflict with that of some other entertainment or 
program previously arranged for. 
14, Publicity. All special school activities should be 
properly advertised so that everyone in the community 
may be informed. This can be done through the schools, 
churches, and local papers. It should be done in due time 
to prevent interference with other important entertain- 
ments or activities.
-P-A-G-E-329
  GRADUATION EXERCISES 313 
Immediately following the program or entertainment 
a carefully prepared write-up should be handed to the 
local editors. 
15. Securing and Lettering Diplomas. Unless there 
are diplomas on hand they should be secured early in 
order that there may be ample time to have them lettered 
and signed by the proper persons. It is economy to pur- 
chase diplomas in lots of not less than 50 or 100, or to 
supply the school for a term of years. Where this is done, 
however, it is usually necessary in smaller places, to have 
them sent out of town to be lettered, and for this suffi- 
cient time must be allowed. 
16. Local Printing. All local printing, such as pro- 
grams, tickets, and invitations should be carefully 
planned and arranged for in due time. 
17. Closing of Regular School Work. Plan and pre- 
pare in advance a list of the various duties connected 
with the closing of the teachers’ regular work. Supply 
each teacher with a copy of this list and necessary direc- 
tions several days before the end of the school year.

CHAPTER XXI 
TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 
Teachers’ meetings afford an opportunity for discuss- 
ing the various problems of the schools and instructing 
teachers with respect to their work. If properly con- 
ducted, they can be made to promote unity and harmony 
as well as to increase the general efficiency of the regular 
work, Dutton, in speaking of the teachers’ meeting, 
says: “It is as vital to the welfare of the school as the 
Sunday service is to that of the church. It often serves 
a purpose not unlike that of a consultation of physicians, 
inasmuch as special cases of inaptness and misconduct, 
which baffle the individual teacher, are successfully 
diagnosed through the wisdom of several.” + 
There are two kinds of teachers’ meetings: the general 
meeting, intended for all; and the special meeting, which 
usually includes only the teachers of one or more specific 
grades or subjects. We shall discuss these meetings 
separately. 
The general meeting—Through the general meeting 
the superintendent should seek to discuss matters per- 
taining to administrative routine, the course of study, 
and general needs and requirements; to help all teachers 
understand the program as planned; and to bring about 
codperation, common aims, and common standards of 
*Samuel T. Dutton, School Management, p. 42.

-P-A-G-E-331
  TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 315 
judgment. Matters pertaining to the interrelation be- 
tween teachers with respect to certain duties and re- 
sponsibilities, their responsibilities to the principal and 
superintendent, and their relation with the janitor and 
other employees may also be considered at these meet- 
ings. Special care should be exercised to see that those 
teachers who are new in the system have a clear under- 
standing of the duties and responsibilities which they 
share jointly or in common with other teachers. Among 
the more important of these are assembly-room duties; 
duties pertaining to the care of books, equipment, and 
other school property used by the pupils of various grades 
and departments; and hall, basement, and playground 
duties. 
General meetings may be held periodically or as occa- 
sions demand. As to how often they should be held there 
is no authority, and little agreement. It is quite gen- 
erally maintained, however, that they should be held as 
often as once a month, and at regular intervals. Occa- 
sionally it will always be necessary to have a call meeting 
in order to take care of matters which need immediate 
attention. 
From time to time a general meeting may well be held 
for social or inspirational purposes. It is usually well to 
hold a social meeting just before the schools open in the 
fall, or soon thereafter. Such a meeting, while social in 
nature, should nevertheless aim to promote a spirit of 
common interest and good fellowship, and to smooth the 
path for all teachers, especially for those who are new in 
the system. 
Ordinarily, the most suitable time for holding a general 
meeting is at the close of the regular school work in the
-P-A-G-E-332
  316 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
afternoon. It is true that teachers are more or less tired 
at this time of the day, but they generally prefer meeting 
after school to being called together in the evening or on 
Saturdays. If the meeting is of a social nature it is 
usually held in the evening. 
The special meeting—Special meetings are usually 
held for the purpose of considering matters that concern 
teachers of certain subjects, grades, or departments only. 
In such meetings, confined to a limited number of teach- 
ers, and called for a purpose in which all are directly 
interested, a more thorough and intensive study can be 
made of the subject or problems under consideration. 
These meetings should be informal; questions and sug- 
gestions should always be in order; and a frank and free 
discussion on the part of all teachers should be encour- 
aged. On the other hand, all should be held to the sub- 
ject or question under consideration, and all trivial and 
irrelevant matter should be avoided in order that the 
meeting may not be unduly prolonged. Ordinarily such 
meetings should not be over an hour or an hour and 
fifteen minutes in length, and should begin and adjourn 
on time. 
In the special meeting plans, methods, and devices 
for teaching; material on different subjects; and experi- 
ments and investigations may be discussed. One or more 
times during a semester teachers may be required to bring 
to these meetings papers prepared on a given subject or 
phase of their work, or specimens of work done by their 
pupils. Books and magazine articles may also be re- 
viewed at these meetings. The subject or problems to 
be discussed should be announced several days in advance 
in order that teachers may have an opportunity to pre-
-P-A-G-E-333
TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 317 
pare themselves for taking an active part in the discus- 
sion or to talk on any phase of the matter in which they 
may be especially interested. A teacher may well lead 
the meeting from time to time. 
Occasionally, in meetings of the lower-grade teachers, 
it is well to have a class conducted by some teacher who 
is especially well prepared to do so. When this is done 
attention should be called beforehand to the methods and 
principles to be demonstrated and studied. The class 
should be so conducted that these are clearly brought out, 
and after the class has been dismissed they should be 
further discussed by the teachers. Inexperienced teach- 
ers especially will, as a rule, profit more by such a dem- 
onstration than by a general discussion of the methods 
and principles under consideration. 
From time to time the teachers of two or more con- 
secutive grades should meet to discuss and make a study 
of the subject-matter that precedes and follows their par- 
ticular work in a given subject. It is important that a 
teacher have an understanding of the sequence and con- 
tinuity of a given subject through several successive 
grades, or see the relatedness of her part to the whole. 
Restricting the special meeting in small schools—In 
small school systems where there are fewer than ten to 
twenty teachers, and where the superintendent himself 
teaches regular classes, it may be impractical to hold 
many special meetings for teachers of separate grades 
and subjects. Here it is often more practical to talk over 
some things with teachers individually whenever it may 
be convenient or seem advisable, and to take up other 
matters at the general meetings of all teachers. The best 
results will be obtained, however, if at least some of the 
 
-P-A-G-E-334
  318 | A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
meetings are held separately with the teachers of one or 
a few consecutive grades, and with those of a given 
subject in departmentalized or high school work. One of 
the chief advantages in this is that it affords an oppor- 
tunity for teachers to discuss with one another their 
respective problems, experiences, and views. 
Another way to take care of both general and special 
matters without requiring all teachers to sit through a 
lengthy meeting and listen to discussions of which a 
small part concerns them individually, is to have the 
grade teachers or those of a given subject convene at 
some designated meeting place a half hour or so in ad- 
vance of the others, during which time matters can be 
discussed that concern them only. Following this such 
matters as concern all teachers may be taken up and 
when these have been discussed or disposed of those 
teachers who arrived first may be excused while the 
others remain another half hour to discuss their special 
problems. The writer has frequently conducted meetings 
in this way and has found it quite satisfactory. In fol- 
lowing this method, however, it is necessary to plan 
carefully in advance the matters to be considered by each 
of the special groups and by all teachers. (See teachers’ 
meetings September 3 and 14, chapter 24) 
General Suggestions 
1. It is well to make notes during the week of all 
matters that should be considered at the next teachers’ 
meeting. These notes may be worked over and organized 
later so that the various problems or items can be taken 
up in proper order and sequence. All matters should be 
so planned and studied that they can be presented and
-P-A-G-E-335
  TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 319 
discussed intelligently and with dispatch. It is well also 
to task teachers to make notes from time to time of 
anything they wish to have discussed at the meetings. 
These notes should be given to the superintendent before 
the meeting. 
2. Meetings should not be called or held for the pur- 
pose of giving out information or directions to teachers 
which could as well be given to them in typewritten or 
mimeographed form. 
8. It is well to supply each teacher with a typewritten 
or mimeographed copy of such matters and details as are 
likely otherwise to be forgotten. Directions pertaining 
to general rules and regulations; and such matters as the 
keeping of records and making of reports; the grading 
and promotion of pupils; and the use of planbooks, note- 
books, and other material, should be in writing. By 
providing each teacher with a copy of carefully worded 
directions pertaining to these matters, before the meet- 
ing, they can usually be more intelligently discussed and 
more readily understood. 
4. Unless the meeting is to be held at some regular 
interval and place understood by all teachers concerned, 
the superintendent should notify all in due time. This 
may be done by sending teachers individual notices, or 
by posting one or more notices in appropriate places 
designated for this purpose. Whenever it is possible this 
should be done two or more days before the time of the 
meeting. If the meeting to be held calls for a considera- 
tion or discussion of matters which require special prepa- 
ration on the part of certain teachers, these teachers 
should be informed of this fact and directed, if necessary, 
at a time that will enable them to make the necessary 
 
-P-A-G-E-336
  320 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
preparation. The notice should give the date, time, and 
place of meeting. 
5. All meetings should begin on time and should so 
far as possible always adjourn on time. 
6. Ordinarily the meeting should not be over an hour 
or an hour and fifteen minutes in length, and should not 
be allowed to drag. It is important that all business be 
conducted as promptly and expeditiously as practicable. 
7. Teachers should be encouraged to take an active 
part in the meeting and should feel free to ask questions 
and to discuss their work and problems. Generally a 
teachers’ meeting should be conducted with a view to 
solicit codperation and contribution of all teachers. It 
should be a place where teachers work and receive help. 
8. Some things may well be left to a vote of the teach- 
ers, and teachers generally should have a part in deciding 
important matters; but a superintendent who allows his 
teachers to gain the impression that everything should 
be left to a majority vote, will soon lose his prestige and 
become a figurehead. Majority rule usually means 
diffused responsibility, and too often leads to authority 
or rule by no one. 
9. It is well to keep a record of the proceedings of each 
meeting. Some teacher may be appointed to act as secre- 
tary during the meeting and to make a record of all im- 
portant matters considered. Such a record, if properly 
made and filed, will enable the superintendent to know 
what has been said and done, as well as what has been 
left unsaid or undone. 
10. It should be clearly understood that no teacher is 
to be excused from attending teachers’ meetings except
-P-A-G-E-337
  
TEACHERS’ MEETINGS 321 
for unavoidable reasons, or by special permission from 
the superintendent. 
11. It is well to let the principal or some teacher lead 
the meeting occasionally. This is true especially where 
the meeting is of a social nature, or where it pertains 
chiefly to some phase of work or subject-matter with 
which she is well acquainted. 
12. If the high school is sufficiently large to be chiefly 
under the direction of the principal, she should of course, 
be permitted to call the high school teachers together 
to consider such matters as are generally left to her 
direction. In large school systems the high school prin- 
cipal usually has complete charge of matters pertaining 
to the meetings of high school teachers.

  CHAPTER XXII 
THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 
Advantages in having a parent-teacher association— 
The parent-teacher association is an effective device for 
bringing about a closer and more intelligent codperation 
between the school and the home. Through it teachers 
and parents may become better acquainted with each 
other’s needs and services, and work together in the in- 
terest of the child. Parent-teacher associations are now 
quite common even in smaller communities, and every 
community can profit by such an association, if it is 
properly organized and if its activities are carefully 
planned and carried out. From the administrator’s point 
of view such an organization affords an excellent means 
for bringing before the patrons of the school new ideas 
and policies, and for interesting them in any change or 
phase of additional activity. Likewise it affords an op- 
portunity for the teacher to meet the parents of the 
children in her charge and to discuss with them matters 
pertaining to the progress and needs of these children. 
It is a well-known fact that parents and teacher often 
misunderstand each other because they fail to get ac- 
quainted, and this very often is due to the fact that they 
have no good opportunity to meet under favorable 
conditions.

tion by teachers to the homes of pupils, found that teach- 
ers, when left to take the initiative in the matter, do not 
visit the homes, even if the matter has been called to 
their attention. He points out that parents likewise do 
not, as a rule, visit the school with the idea of actually 
working out with the teacher problems and matters per- 
taining to the best interests of the child, and that the 
modern school must have some other means whereby 
the parents and the teacher are brought in touch with each 
other under favorable circumstances.? 
How to organize a parent-teacher association—In 
promoting a parent-teacher association as a new under- 
taking it is necessary, first, of course, to create an interest 
in the matter. Two or three interested and active per- 
sons, however, can do the necessary preliminary work and 
start the movement. Before a public meeting is called 
for the purpose of organization there should be sufficient 
publicity to insure its being thoroughly representative 
of the community at large, and to avoid from the be- 
ginning any tendency toward factionalism or dominance 
of any particular set or group. Through the local news- 
paper and the school it is possible to reach practically 
every one in the community. The local editor, as a rule, 
will be glad to give to the promoters of such an organiza- 
tion a reasonable amount of space, and children generally 
are glad and anxious to carry to their parents any in- 
formation or notice concerning such a movement. 
The first meeting—It is very important that the 
necessary preliminary work be definitely and carefully 
outlined, and that those interested in the organization 
*H. T. McKinney, “The Function of the Parent-Teacher Club,” 
School Board Journal, Nov., 1921, pp. 34-35.
-P-A-G-E-340
  324 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
are present at the first meeting. An effort should be 
made to have at this meeting a well-planned program, 
and to have represented thereon various local talent and 
child-welfare interests. Where it is possible to have 
children give a part of the program it will be found easier 
to get parents to come to the meeting. The program 
should not be long, but interesting, and should be well 
advertised. 
In a meeting of this kind, which is not one of an 
organized society, any member of the assembly may act 
as temporary chairman. Where the superintendent takes 
the initiative and calls the meeting, and especially where 
children have a part on the program, he or the principal 
or some teacher may well call the meeting to order and 
preside during the program. Following the program 
some patron of the school should come forward, and 
after stating the aim and purpose of the meeting, move 
that some person, here named, act as temporary chair- 
man. This should be a person who has been consulted 
about the matter in advance and who is known to be in 
sympathy with the movement. If there is a second to 
this motion and if it is carried by a majority vote, the 
person named will act as chairman of the meeting. If 
the motion is lost some one else must be nominated and 
voted on. This, however, will seldom be necessary if 
those interested in the organization have an understand- 
ing concerning whom they wish to elect as temporary 
chairman. 
The person elected as temporary chairman will come 
forward and take the chair, and the first business now 
in order is the election of a temporary secretary. When 
the temporary secretary has been elected she will take  
-P-A-G-E-341
THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 325 
her seat near the chairman and keep a record of the 
proceedings. The chairman will then call upon various 
persons present for an expression of their views and opin- 
ions concerning the movement or proposed organization. 
Those called upon to speak will, as a rule, know in ad- 
vance that they are to be asked to say something and will 
have prepared themselves to do so. No one should here 
consume more than from two to five minutes of time. 
When the various persons called upon to speak have 
finished, the chairman may ask to hear from any one in 
the assembly who may have something further to add or 
suggest. This will, as a rule, lead to discussions in which 
all should feel free to participate. After a reasonable 
time has been allowed for this purpose some one should 
offer a resolution to the effect that a parent-teacher asso- 
ciation be formed. Those who are most interested in the 
movement usually will have agreed previously as to what 
should be done, and will have prepared themselves to 
offer a suitable resolution at the proper time. When 
this resolution has been adopted, a committee may be 
appointed to draft a simple constitution. A committee 
may now also be appointed to nominate permanent offi- 
cers of the association, after which the meeting may 
adjourn to meet at a specified time and place. It is well 
to fix the time for the next meeting to be held at an 
early date while the interest in the matter is alive. After 
the meeting some enthusiastic member should prepare for 
the editor of the local paper a written account of the 
meeting. 
The second meeting—At the second meeting the tem- 
porary officers will serve until the permanent officers have 
been elected. After the reading and approval of the  
-P-A-G-E-342
    326 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
minutes of the last meeting the first business in order is 
the report of the committe on the constitution. The 
chairman of this committee reads the report, after which 
some one moves that it be adopted. When the motion 
has been seconded the chairman orders that the constitu- 
tion reported be read by sections. After each section has 
been read he asks for amendments. If no amendments 
are proposed, he proceeds with the next section in like 
manner until the whole document has been read. When- 
ever an amendment is proposed it is voted upon at once, 
but no vote need be taken upon a separate section after 
it is amended. When the sections have all been read 
the constitution is still open to amendment, and anyone 
may move amendments to any part of it. When no 
further amendments are proposed the original question 
on adoption is in order. If by-laws are desired they may 
be treated in like manner. 
Suggestive forms of local constitutions and by-laws, 
and detailed information on the duties of officers may 
be secured from various sources. The National Congress 
of Mothers and Parent-Teacher Association, Washington, 
D. C., or any state association will be glad to supply such 
information free of charge. 
Permanent officers—When the constitution has been 
adopted, the next business in order is the election of 
permanent officers. There should be a president, vice- 
president, and secretary-treasurer, elected annually. It 
is needless to say that these officers should be selected 
with the utmost care and with a view to their fitness for 
the particular work in question. The success or failure 
of the organization will be determined in a very large 
measure by the judgment and efficiency of its officers.
-P-A-G-E-343
THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 327 
The president should be a parent, preferably a mother 
who is keenly interested in the organization and who is 
recognized as a leader in the community. She will have 
much to do to keep all interested and actively at work 
in performing their respective duties. The vice-presi- 
dent, likewise, should be a person qualified to perform 
the duties of the president in her absence or incapacity. 
The secretary-treasurer will also have many important 
duties to perform. 
Committees—It is quite necessary to have a clear 
understanding of the functions of committees, in order 
that such committees as are needed in the work of the 
association may be created. Judicious care should be 
exercised in the selection of the chairmen of all important 
committees, since generally the action of a committee 
determines the action of the assembly. Every committee 
should consist of persons who are well qualified for the 
particular work in question and who are heartily in 
sympathy with the proposed action. A committee for 
action should be small and should not be overloaded with 
work. 
A brief outline of the usual standing committees and 
their chief duties is here given. Special committees may 
be appointed whenever it seems advisable. 
1. Committee on Membership. The committee on 
membership should solicit the interest and codperation 
of all those who are not already members of the or- 
ganization. This committee will always have something 
to do, since there are always persons who are backward 
and who fear that they may be unwelcome. It is the 
duty of the committee to call upon these persons in their 
homes and make them feel cordially welcome. In some  
-P-A-G-E-344
  328 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
instances a second call may be necessary. The com- 
mittee should report all new members to the association, 
and should codperate with the program committee in 
securing the largest possible attendance. 
2. The Program Committee. Since this committee 
makes the general plans for the various programs of the 
year, it is essential that its members represent a variety 
of different interests as well as tact and good judgment. 
It is quite important, too, that both parents and teachers 
be represented on this committee. The chief aim of the 
committee should be to plan the several programs so as 
to bring about a maximum of good results. Care must 
be exercised not to allow selfish persons to use their 
influence in having themselves or their friends placed 
on the program too often. The modest and reticent 
should be urged and invited to appear, while the selfish 
or aggressive must often be held back. This not infre- 
quently requires much tact and diplomacy. It is well to 
have parents, teachers, and children represented on each 
program. The committee must make sure that the 
assignments made and the activities planned for a given 
meeting are ready for presentation at the time on which 
they are due. . 
3. Publicity Committee. It is the duty of this com- 
mittee to see that the activities and commendable work 
of the association are kept properly before the public. 
The committee may well enlist every interested member 
to spread any good news pertaining to the work of the or- 
ganization, and should make use of the press, the school, 
and the pulpit for this purpose. The chairman of the 
committee should be a person who is able to write for 
publication. He should see to it that every meeting is
-P-A-G-E-345
  THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 329 
properly advertised in the local paper, and that a careful 
report of the meetings held appears in the paper. The 
regular attendance at any given meeting will in a large 
measure depend on the skill and enthusiasm of the pub- 
licity committee. Instead of creating a committee of 
two or more members, local organizations frequently 
appoint an individual press chairman or press agent to 
look after the publicity work. 
4. Reception Committee. It is the duty of the recep- 
tion committee, ordinarily, to receive and entertain 
guests, to welcome new members into the association, to 
codéperate with the membership committee in securing 
the attendance of new teachers and others who may come 
into the community from time to time, and to provide 
for receptions. It is quite common to give a reception 
early in the school year to which all patrons of the school 
and teachers are invited. The members of this commit- 
tee should be congenial and cheerful, and able to make 
guests and newcomers feel at home. 
Affiliation with the State Branch of the National 
Congress of Mothers and Parent-teacher Association— 
Every parent-teacher association should seek to affiliate 
with the State Branch of the National Congress as soon 
as it is formed. In this way its opportunity for useful- 
ness can be greatly enhanced and its permanency insured. 
By joining the State Congress the local association be- 
comes a member of the National Congress, which is the 
greatest institution of its kind in the world, and which 
“has the codperation of the U. S. Bureau of Education 
and other Government Departments in its educational 
work.” The cost of joining it is practically negligible. 
The dues are ten cents a year per member, five of which
-P-A-G-E-346
  330 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
is retained by the State Congress while five goes to the 
National Congress. 
By writing to the National Congress, 1201 Sixteenth 
St., N.W., Washington, D. C., much valuable information 
may be obtained at a very small cost on child nature; 
the organization of parent-teacher associations; program 
making; and suggestions for study courses by parents. 
This Congress also loans to associations in membership, 
for a few cents each, typewritten papers which furnish 
valuable educational material and which may be read 
and discussed by members of the local association. 
Programs and activities—It would be quite impos- 
sible to give a detailed outline here of the character of 
the various programs to be given and of the work to be 
taken up by the parent-teacher association, since in every 
community certain local problems will present them- 
selves from time to time and will determine the relative 
importance of the immediate work to be done. Nor 
does it matter greatly what the particular work is so 
long as something definite is accomplished, and there will 
always be something definite and worth while to do. The 
problems which concern the welfare of children are suffi- 
ciently numerous and important to engage the best 
efforts of all the members of any organization. 
A few suggestions are here given: 
1. To be successful a parent-teacher association must 
be democratic and unselfish in its activities, and its first 
duty must be to serve. It should recognize no cast, and 
its services should be such as to appeal sympathetically 
to all parents and teachers of whatever social and educa- 
tional rank. 
2. Meetings and programs should begin promptly on
-P-A-G-E-347
  THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 331 
time, and all business should be conducted with dispatch 
and in accordance with recognized parliamentary proced- 
ure. On the other hand, all unnecessary formality should 
be avoided. 
8. There should be both afternoon and evening meet- 
ings. Men are usually busy with other work during week 
days, which means that afternoon meetings are as a rule 
attended by women only; and since it is quite essential 
to the success of the association that men as well as 
women take an active interest in the meetings, it is well 
that at least some of the meetings be held in the evening 
so that those men who cannot leave their regular duties 
during the daytime may have an opportunity to attend. 
To these evening meetings fathers should be especially 
urged to come and participate in the program. The 
character of the program should, of course, be such as to 
be of greatest interest and service to the kind of audience 
expected. 
Meetings of a social nature are commonly held in the 
evening, and it is generally conceded that there should 
be an informal period after each meeting. 
4. For entertainments both instrumental and vocal 
music are always desirable, especially music by some 
class, glee club, or school orchestra. Public community 
singing should also be encouraged and, where it can be 
introduced, may well constitute a part of every program. 
Occasional readings, short plays, demonstrations, ex- 
hibits, and gymnastic stunts are appropriate and are 
generally desirable. As far as possible each grade should 
take part in the programs during the year. 
5. An occasional address by local and outside speakers 
who are well prepared and have gomething definite to
-P-A-G-E-348
  332 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
offer is desirable. Lengthy addresses, however, should, 
as a rule, be discouraged. In case of several speakers, 
they should be kept strictly within the limit of their 
allotted time, and should confine themselves to the topics 
assigned. The chairman will do well to remind the 
speakers firmly at the beginning of the program that they 
will be expected to conclude their remarks after a given 
length of time. Where there are three or four speakers 
they should ordinarily not consume more than fifteen 
minutes each. Several short, direct talks on different 
phases of a given subject, followed by informal discus- 
sions, are usually much more helpful than the average 
address of an hour or more in length. 
6. It is generally held by experienced workers in 
parent-teacher associations that the raising of funds for 
school equipment, charity work, and relief work is not 
the proper function of the organization. 
7. The parent-teacher association should seek to co- 
operate in a friendly and helpful way with the school 
board, superintendent, principal, and teachers, but should 
not interfere with the specific duties of the board or 
faculty by taking up such matters as the reélection and 
promotion of teachers or the grading and classifying of 
pupils. 
The following are some of the activities generally 
recommended for consideration by the parent-teacher 
association: 
a. Health inspection of all school children from time 
to time by a competent school nurse or physician, and 
provisions for proper medical and dental care by the 
school authorities where parents are unable to make such 
provisions. 
 
-P-A-G-E-349
  THE PARENT-TEACHER ASSOCIATION 333 
b. “Codperation of health departments in the preven- 
tion of infant mortality by organizing mothers of little 
babies into groups and instructing them in the care and 
feeding of infants.” 
c. Rousing the community to a sense of its duty and 
responsibility to dependent and neglected children. 
d. School sanitation with respect to drainage of 
grounds, drinking water, drinking fountains, heating, 
lighting, and ventilation. 
e. Problems of the adolescent. 
f. “Enlarging the teacher’s opportunities by making 
possible a knowledge of the child’s home environment 
and influence and the parents’ viewpoint.” 
g. The selection of books to be obtained through tray- 
eling and circulating libraries.. 
h. Home libraries and books to be selected. 
i, School and community surveys. 
j. The school as a community center where evening 
classes, extension courses and entertainments may be 
given, and where older people as well as the young may 
come for knowledge and entertainment. 
k. Playground equipment and activities. 
1. The formation of various clubs for civic welfare 
work, such as canning clubs, clubs for the destruction of 
insects, etc. 
m. Thrift and school savings banks. 
n. Finding suitable work for boys and girls during 
vacation, and for those who leave school for various 
reasons. 
o. Neighborhood picnics and community play-days. 
p. Launching and carrying through a building pro- 
gram.

CHAPTER XXIII 
THE JANITOR 
Importance of efficient janitorial service—Generally 
speaking those employed in the janitorial service of our 
public schools are not given the consideration or accorded 
the respect to which the importance of their work en- 
titles them. The janitor is one of the most important 
employees of a modern school system. He is the cus- 
todian and caretaker of buildings, equipment, and 
grounds, and is often an important factor in the general 
discipline of the school. His duties are many and varied 
and much depends upon the prompt and efficient per- 
formance of these duties. The comfort of pupils and 
teachers, the attractiveness of the various rooms, corri- 
dors, ete., and the upkeep of the playground are of vital 
concern to a school, and in the setting of these conditions 
the work of the janitor is indispensable. A good janitor 
must be intelligent, skilful, alert, and reliable. He must 
be acquainted with approved methods of modern sanita- 
tion, heating, and ventilation, and must be a man of tact 
and good manners in his relation to principal, teachers, 
and pupils. 
Making the janitor’s position worth while—The jani- 
tor should be employed for one or two months in addition 
to the regular school year, or for the entire year. If he 
is the kind of man he should be, there will always be 
335 
 
-P-A-G-E-352
    
336 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
something for him to do during the summer months. 
The building should be thoroughly cleaned and over- 
hauled after the close of the regular school term. There 
is practically always some repair work and usually there 
are alterations and new improvements to be made. The 
school grounds, if they are to be properly kept, must not 
be allowed to grow up in weeds during the summer. 
It is possible, too, as a rule, to secure and retain better 
men if the employment is for at least ten or eleven 
months of the year. To employ an inefficient man for 
the janitorial work of a school system, or to change 
janitors frequently, entails more loss through wasteful 
experimentation and neglect of duty than the average 
community realizes. Generally speaking it is only the 
man who thinks his position worth while and desires to 
hold it who can be counted upon to do his best, and only 
the janitor who has charge of a building for a term of 
years can be held accountable for the upkeep of the 
building, equipment, and grounds. 
In some smaller communities the janitor is the only 
employee in the school system who remains in the service 
for a term of years, while superintendent and teachers 
come and go and while the personnel of the school board 
not infrequently changes completely. In such a place a 
good janitor is indispensable in the conservation of build- 
ings, equipment, and supplies. It does not follow, how- 
ever, that a janitor is efficient and capable because he has 
been in the service for a number of years. In communi- 
ties where the administrative head of the school changes 
every year or two, and where the board does not concern 
itself to inspect the work of the janitor, he is not likely 
to be a man who has made an intelligent effort to keep
-P-A-G-E-353
  THE JANITOR 337 
abreast of the times and improve his services by observ- 
ing and adopting new and better methods. On the con- 
trary he is likely to be inefficient and “set in his ways’— 
opposed to the introduction of new methods and averse 
to directions or instructions. Not infrequently he has 
come to think that he is authority on all matters pertain- 
ing to his work and that the superintendent, especially 
if he is a younger man, should not be allowed to dictate 
to him or tell him what need be done. 
Janitors need specific training—In order to be success- 
ful a janitor must have good common sense and physical 
strength, but these alone will no longer qualify him to 
perform properly the duties of a janitor, even in a smaller 
school system. Neither is the Jack-of-all-trades, as a 
rule, the type of man to be employed as janitor of a 
school building. With the introduction of complicated 
heating, lighting, and ventilating systems, and with mod- 
ern methods of cleaning and housekeeping the work of 
the janitor is becoming more and more of a science in- 
volving specialized technic. The janitor, therefore, as 
well as the teacher, principal, and superintendent needs 
special preparation or specific training for his work. In 
recent years a number of colleges and universities and 
a few of the larger city school systems have established 
training schools for janitors. In other places the school 
board and superintendent now plan and formulate direc- 
tions and courses of instructions for their janitors, and 
those who are willing and able to increase their usefulness 
are remunerated accordingly. With a little careful co- 
operative planning on the part of the board, superin- 
tendent, and janitor, provisions can be made in any 
community for helpful instructions and directions, and 
 
-P-A-G-E-354
  338 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
in many instances this would save much unnecessary 
expense and bring about a higher degree of efficiency in 
the janitor’s work. 
The following suggestions will be found helpful: 
1. Arrange definitely for one or more meetings to be 
held each year for a discussion of the janitor’s needs and 
of the latest and best methods and information pertain- 
ing to the janitor’s work. In preparation for these meet- 
ings helpful information and reference material should 
be collected in advance. In this it is well to consult also 
the city engineer, the health officer, and heads of indus- 
trial and manufacturing plants. With a little systematic 
effort much valuable information may be brought to- 
gether from practical experience and from magazines and 
books. In this way much can also be done to prevent 
misunderstandings with respect to the needs and duties 
of the janitor. Such meetings, if conducted in the right 
spirit and with a view to bring about the greatest 
efficiency in the janitorial service, can be made very 
profitable. Most janitors will not only welcome these 
meetings, but will feel honored to have a part in the 
planning and discussions, and as a result will go at their 
work with added interest and with a better spirit. 
2. Prepare and place in the hands of the janitor a 
manual of instruction. This manual may consist of 
loose-leaf typewritten sheets placed in a substantial note- 
book cover. It should call attention to the importance 
of the janitor’s work; define his relation to principal, 
teachers, and pupils; and enumerate his regular duties. 
Definite directions may here be given (with book and 
magazine references) on such subjects as disinfecting,
-P-A-G-E-355
  THE JANITOR 339 
fumigating, humidity, repairs, best methods of sweeping 
and cleaning, and necessary precautions against fire, 
waste of material, etc. The janitor may well have a part 
in the making of this manual. There should also be a 
record of scheduled tasks which he may be asked to make, 
or should make with the help of the superintendent, on 
a simple form provided for that purpose. This record 
should be accessible to principal and superintendent, and 
should be discussed with the janitor in a frank and open © 
manner. It may also serve to show the superintendent 
and board whether additional help, equipment, etc., are 
needed. 
3. If the janitor is new in the building, the superin- 
tendent should assist him in every way in becoming 
familiar with the apparatus and equipment of the build- 
ing, with the general rules and regulations of the school, 
and with the best and most practical ways of performing 
his various duties. If he has had no previous experience 
as janitor of a school building, there will be many things 
concerning which he will need definite instruction. He 
should not, however, be required to do all his work ac- 
cording to specific orders, but should be allowed to exer- 
cise his judgment. 
The janitor’s work should be inspected from time to 
time by the superintendent directly and by the board 
either directly or through the superintendent. Good 
work should always be recognized. Janitors, like teach- 
ers, will work better when they know their efforts are 
appreciated. 
In his directions a young and inexperienced superin- 
tendent should be careful not to assume an air of 
 
-P-A-G-E-356
  340 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
superiority or the attitude of a boss toward the janitor. 
He should be a co-worker with him. This will bring 
about the most efficient service on the part of both. 
Responsible directly to superintendent—In order to 
avoid misunderstandings and divided authority the 
janitor of a smaller school system should be responsible 
directly to the superintendent in all matters pertaining 
to his regular or general duties. He should be responsible 
to the board through the superintendent. He may be 
directed in specific duties by the board or by a committee 
of the board. He should, of course, be given a certain 
amount of leeway, and should be required to exercise 
judgment with respect to many things that will need 
attention from time to time. He should at all times 
codperate with principal and teachers in maintaining 
good order and conduct. 
If the janitor has special requests or complaints to 
make concerning his work, he should first take the matter 
up with the superintendent. If he fails to get satisfaction 
here, he may then see the board. The superintendent 
should have an understanding with the board as to his 
authority with respect to extra or special duties that he 
may or may not require of the janitor. If he is inexpe- 
rienced he will do well always to consult the president 
of the board or some other board member who may be 
experienced. If the janitor does not wish to perform 
certain duties that he may be called upon to perform by 
the superintendent, he should have provisions to that 
effect in a written contract. He may or may not, for 
example, be required to be on playground or basement 
duty during the noon hour. Likewise he may or may not 
be required to come to the school building in the evening  
-P-A-G-E-357
THE JANITOR 341 
for basketball practice or gymnasium exercises, play re- 
hearsals, ete. During the winter months especially the 
janitor must be at the building early in the morning and 
should not be asked to be on duty in the evening unless 
it is quite necessary. Janitors, like teachers and other 
employees, should have some time for recreation. 
Many cities have formulated rules and regulations de- 
fining the duties of janitors. The following is a list of 
duties that are usually required. 
Duties of the Janitor 
1. Heating and ventilation—Under the direction of 
the superintendent or the principal the janitor shall have 
exclusive management of the heating and ventilating 
systems. When fires are needed he shall have the build- 
ing warm at a specified time in the morning and keep all 
rooms properly heated for school purposes. This means 
that he must visit all rooms in the building often enough 
to know that they are properly heated. Unless the 
building has adequate means of ventilation all rooms 
should be thoroughly ventilated by opening windows, 
both morning and evening. Where there is no ventilat- 
ing system in the building all rooms in use should also be 
thoroughly aired during each intermission. 
2. Sweeping and dusting—aAll rooms, halls, and stair- 
ways shall be swept daily. Sweeping should not be done 
while teacher and pupils are in the room and should not 
unduly hurry teachers in the afternoon. Tables, desks, 
chairs, etc., should be dusted every morning before school. 
Walls, ceilings, windows, pictures, etc., should be kept 
free from cobwebs and dust. 
3. Scrubbing, washing and cleaning-—All floors, plat- 
 
-P-A-G-E-358
342 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
forms, and stairs, shall be scrubbed and all windows 
washed twice a year—once before school opens in the 
fall and once during winter vacation, and oftener if it . 
seems necessary or is required by the superintendent or 
board. 
Inside toilet rooms should be swept daily and scrubbed 
or mopped as often as is necessary to keep them in good 
condition. Bowls should be cleaned daily and no mark- 
ings or writing should be allowed to remain on the walls 
or fixtures. 
Blackboards should be washed occasionally. Erasers - 
and chalk trays should be cleaned one or more times each 
week depending on how much they are used. 
4, Walks and grounds—The walks on and around the 
school lot shall be kept free from snow, ice, and mud. 
The grounds shall be kept free from rubbish and as at- 
tractive as is reasonably possible. 
5. Repairs—The janitor shall do what he can to see 
that everything in the school building and on the school 
grounds is kept in proper repair. He should be able to 
make all necessary minor repairs himself. Any needed 
repairs that he cannot make himself he should report to 
the superintendent or principal at once. 
6. Bells, clocks, etc.—The janitor shall ring the bell 
according to schedule, wind and regulate clocks as often 
as may be necessary, adjust automatic door closers, ete. 
7. Helping maintain order—The janitor shall have 
exclusive charge of the school building during the absence 
of teachers between school hours. Under the instructions 
of the superintendent or principal he shall assist in main- 
taining order in the halls and basement, and on the play- 
grounds. In this he shall have the same authority as
-P-A-G-E-359
THE JANITOR 343 
teachers. Ordinarily the janitor should be on the 
premises during intermissions, and should not leave the 
premises without the knowledge or consent of the 
superintendent. 
8. Criticism—The janitor shall refrain from all criti- 
cism of affairs which may affect a teacher or reflect upon 
the good interest of the schools. He must not gossip 
about school matters, and must be courteous to teachers 
and pupils. 
9. Special exercises—When special exercises are to be 
held at the school building in the evening during times 
that artificial heating is necessary, the janitor should see 
that the room or rooms to be used are in proper condition. 
Likewise when teachers have special exercises in their 
rooms during the day which call for extra chairs or re- 
arrangement of furniture the janitor should lend his 
assistance. He should, however, be informed of any 
extra or special duties a reasonable time in advance so 
that he may plan his work accordingly. 
10. Janitor’s inventory—The janitor shall, within ten 
days prior to the close of the school year, make a report, 
containing a complete list of all tools and utensils used 
by him in caring for the building and grounds, including 
also school desks and other equipment not in use, and 
their condition. If the janitor has charge of, or is a 
member of a committee who has charge of the purchasing 
of janitor supplies, an inventory of supplies on hand 
should be made. A copy of this report shall be filed 
with the secretary.

CHAPTER XXIV 
EVERY-DAY DUTIES AND DEMANDS 
(With six days in detail) 
Duties of a superintendent much misunderstood— 
The position of superintendent of a smaller school system 
is a recent creation, and is frequently very much mis- 
understood, not only by the general public but very often 
by the members of the school board, and not infrequently 
by the superintendent himself. In spite of the fact that 
he has dealings directly and indirectly with more people 
in the community than anyone else, and by virtue of his 
position has more real influence in matters of supreme 
importance than any other public servant, there are com- 
paratively few who know just what the duties of a school 
superintendent are, or what his qualifications should be. 
Criticism often based on ignorance and misunder- 
standing—There are always many critics who claim to 
know just what is wrong with the schools and who express 
themselves unhesitatingly as to what should be done. 
Very often they are those who never visit the schools, 
who have never concerned themselves to make a careful 
study of any school problem, and who have little or no 
understanding of the aims and purposes of a modern 
school. With no complete knowledge of school problems 
or needs and little understanding of the hundred and one 
duties that devolve upon the superintendent, they are 
345 
 
-P-A-G-E-362
  346 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
inclined to think that he is quite useless, unless he teaches 
classes all day, and, in either case, that he is getting too 
much salary. They are the ones, generally, who view the 
tax levy and every item of expenditure with alarm. In 
their firm conviction, their lack of definite knowledge, 
and their ignorance of facts they too often pretend and 
bluff where they should seek to understand. 
Not infrequently, too, respectable and leading citizens 
of the community who are progressive sae weeea in 
their chosen calling or profession are very neglectful of 
their duties and obligations towards the schools, and 
quite ignorant concerning the problems and duties of the 
superintendent. 
Board and superintendent should keep public in- 
formed—In many instances the school board and super- 
intendent are most at fault where there is much 
misunderstanding and dissatisfaction about the admin- 
istration of the schools. Boards of education are elected 
by the people to represent the people, and superintend- 
ents are employed by them to carry out the wishes of 
the people according to the directions of the board or in 
accordance with their approval. It is the duty of the 
board and the superintendent to keep the public informed 
as to important changes in the educational program, ex- 
penditures, and needs, and the justification for these 
changes, expenditures, and needs. It is the duty and 
business of the board and the superintendent to direct the 
general educational policy of the community. They 
should seek to know and carry out the wishes of the 
people, but should assume leadership and take the initia- 
tive in matters of educational policies “a expenditures. 
And in order to lead successsfully they must first bring
-P-A-G-E-363
  EVERY-DAY DUTIES AND DEMANDS 347 
about a desire for good schools and an intelligent appre- 
ciation of efforts and expenditures. This can be done 
only by keeping the public enlightened and informed. 
If the superintendent, with the help of the board, 
cannot within a reasonable time convince the public that 
he has something worth-while to do and is earning his 
salary, it is very probable that he is either neglecting to 
inform the public of what they should know or that he 
is not earning his salary. 
A detailed account of six days—The following is a 
detailed account showing what the writer did during six 
different days of the year as superintendent of schools 
at Anita, Iowa (a school system with 248 pupils in the 
grades, 130 in the high school, sixteen teachers, and one 
hour per day office help). The record was made at the 
end of each day from brief memoranda made during the 
day. Everything that seemed worth mentioning has 
been included in order to make the account as complete 
as practicable, though not all petty details, considera- 
tions, and cares were enumerated. The days selected for 
this purpose were chosen with a view to give helpful 
information to those who are aspiring to become superin- 
tendents, as well as to show by way of example the 
variety of different duties that devolve upon the superin- 
tendent of a smaller school system. In a large school 
system with grade and high-school principals in the 
various buildings, special supervisors, secretaries, and 
clerks, the superintendent delegates to these many of the 
duties which in a smaller system he must perform him- 
self. His duties in larger school systems are therefore 
different and are as a rule confined to fewer phases of 
business and educational topics.

Other Considerations and demands—In addition to 
such specific duties as may be enumerated for a given 
day or a number of days, there are various other con- 
siderations that demand the attention and tax the energy 
of a superintendent. Among these are his various obli- 
gations and responsibilities to state and county officials, 
to the school board, parents, and community, as well as 
to the teachers and pupils in the schools. To be success- 
ful he must gain the confidence and respect of all these
-P-A-G-E-374
  358 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
and must live up to what they have a right to expect of 
him. Nor will honest, hard work and cold logic suffice. 
He must be alert and tactful enough to deal effectively 
with politicians, opponents and critics, and with the dis- 
satisfied parent, as well as with children and teachers. 
Unless he can read danger signals, and is able to antici- 
pate and guard against misunderstandings and the de- 
velopment of problems, he is sure to have difficulties and 
grief sooner or later. 
Situations and problems such as the following are not 
infrequently found and encountered. 
1. That the school board is divided and that one of 
the members is bitter toward the superintendent because 
his daughter was not employed as a teacher. 
2. That Smith, an influential citizen, wants his son to 
remain on the football team even though he is not mak- 
ing grades in his academic work. 
3. That the Joneses insist on keeping their children out 
of school every now and then. 
4, That one or more teachers are unable to maintain 
order in their rooms or classes. 
5. That the Parent-Teacher Association is meddling 
with the promotion and dismissal of teachers. 
6. That Mrs. Thomas insists on having Jimmie’s 
arithmetic grades raised. 
7. That the music teacher and the sixth-grade teacher 
hate each other and will not work together. 
8. That certain children are stealing things in the 
cloakrooms. 
9. That a nervous, misinformed mother with a long 
story calls on the superintendent at his office just when 
he is busiest.

  CHAPTER XXV 
RECORDS AND REPORTS 
The keeping of adequate school records and the making 
of proper reports is an important phase of school admin- 
istration. Various current records are necessary for the 
making of reports on the operation of the school system 
and the progress of the work, and permanent records are 
necessary for reference purposes. In order to manage 
his work successfully an administrator must see to it that 
all necessary records are kept efficiently and economically. 
Method of treatment and other studies and sources— 
It does not seem advisable to analyze or treat in detail 
in a book of this nature the many forms and blanks in 
use throughout the country, or to recommend the use 
of any particular form for a given purpose. There is so 
much dissimilarity in the forms used and in the methods 
of accounting employed in different school systems that 
such a treatment of the subject would take us too far 
afield for our immediate purpose. A more extended 
treatment of school records and reports, together with 
descriptive cuts of forms and blanks, has recently been 
given by Strayer and Engelhardt, in The Classroom 
Teacher; by Finney and Schafer, in Administration of 
Village and Consolidated Schools; and by W. Lloyd 
Peterson, in the School Board Journal, June and July, 
1922. Sample copies of the forms and blanks most

commonly used may be obtained from the Bureau of 
Education (Bulletin No. 3, 1912); The Evanston Com- 
pany, School and Office Supplies, Chicago, Ill., and Los 
Angeles, Calif.; Gillan and Company, Milwaukee, Wis.; 
McCormick-Mathers Company, Wichita, Kansas; Metro- 
politan Supply Company, Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Shaw- 
Walker, Muskegon, Mich., and various other school sup- 
ply houses. 
We shall endeavor to treat briefly in this chapter a few 
of the more essential considerations in the making of 
records and reports, show what records and reports are 
essential in a smaller school system, and what they should 
reveal. 
Changes should not be made hastily—A school ad- 
ministrator should not make important or sweeping 
changes in the record forms used and the method of ac- 
counting employed in a school system without a careful 
study of all the details of both the old and the new forms 
and methods under consideration. It may be said that 
practically all of the different sets of record forms on 
the market have their special merits and advantages and 
their demerits and disadvantages. Each salesman will 
carefully point out the good features of his particular 
forms and system; and a superintendent who has not 
made a study of the different forms and methods in use 
is in danger of making a change for the worse if he de- 
cides the matter solely on the advice of some one who 
wishes to sell a new set of record cards and blanks. It is 
generally advisable for a good administrator who is 
new in the system to make important changes in the 
forms and blanks used until he has had a year to study 
the system in operation.
-P-A-G-E-378
  362 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
What we are most in need of is, of course, a more uni- 
form system of record keeping and standardized account- 
ing that can be followed by all schools throughout the 
United States. This need is now very generally recog- 
nized and it is hoped that progress will soon be made in 
this direction, but in the meantime we must deal with 
the situation as it is. 
Simplicity needed—Care should be exercised to avoid 
any unnecessary duplication or needless complication in 
the making of records and reports. This is a common 
fault. Records should be adequate and efficient, but as 
simple as it is possible to make them, in order that they 
may be made economically. 
In many school systems too much time and energy is 
given to recording details and making reports which are 
not and cannot be used for any purpose that justifies 
the labor involved. In some systems an absurd mass of 
laboriously compiled but quite useless data are required 
from teachers and principal in the name of efficient ad- 
ministration. The completeness with which every trivial 
detail is recorded, or the readiness with which every item 
of information may be produced at some future date (in 
case some one should desire the information instantly) 
does not necessarily mean efficiency in school accounting. 
It may be quite the opposite. 
To require teachers in a small school system to cal- 
culate and report monthly such data as average daily 
attendance for boys and girls separately and in terms of 
both numbers and per cent; or to call for a report each 
month showing for every child the number of days ab- 
sent, the number of half days absent, the number of 
times tardy, the number of days present, the number of
-P-A-G-E-379
RECORDS AND REPORTS 363 
days not belonging, and the number of excused and 
unexcused cases is quite unnecessary. Practically all this 
information is or should be given in teacher’s daily class 
register where it may be obtained whenever necessary, 
and it is quite sufficient to require teachers to report in 
detail only when groups or individuals fall below a cer- 
tain or minimum standard. This should be done, if 
necessary, weekly or bi-monthly. 
Registration or entrance enrolment card—This card 
should contain such information as is required at en- 
trance and for the complete, permanent school record of 
the child. It should include the following data: 
. Name in full. 
. Date of enrolment. 
. Birthplace and date. 
Age in years and months. 
Parent or guardian, residence, and telephone. 
. Occupation and business address of parent. 
. Nationality of parents. 
. Vaccination, date. 
. Health. 
10. Physical defects. 
11. Tuition pupil, county, and number of district. 
12. Distance from school building. 
The following items should also be included to be filled 
in for pupils who have attended school elsewhere: 
1. School last attended. 
2. Grades or work completed, and date. 
8. Present grade entered, or course chosen. 
The foregoing information, if accurately recorded and 
filed, will often prevent difficulties and questions of doubt 
later. It is usually a comparatively easy matter to obtain DO ON Mo whe 
 
-P-A-G-E-380
  364 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
this information when the child first enters school and 
such a record is generally accepted as authentic. 
The teacher’s register—The teacher's register should 
contain the attendance and scholarship record of a pupil 
for the entire year. It should be carefully and faithfully 
kept and should be filed at the end of the school year as 
a permanent record. The register should show the fol- 
lowing: (1) name of teacher, (2) the year, (3) the grade, 
(4) names of pupils. (In larger places the address of 
each pupil should also be given.) (5) date of admission, 
(6) date of transfer, (7) days absent, (8) times tardy, 
(9) average grade for each subject, and (10) deportment 
or effort and conduct. Some registers also provide spaces 
for class standing, result of mental or standardized tests, 
and for remarks or explanations concerning such matters 
as irregular attendance or unsatisfactory work. This is 
a good feature. Unless there is a fireproof vault in the 
school building, the register should be filed in a fireproof 
place in some other building as soon as it has been com- 
pleted at the end of the school year. 
The class record—The teacher’s class record book 
should show the pupil’s daily preparation and recitation 
work, as well as any absence from class. It should show 
the scholarship mark of each pupil for each subject. 
Some teachers record these marks daily while others 
indicate the grade of work done one, two, or three times 
a week, depending on the nature of the work, the grade, 
etc. The record book should also show the averages of 
each period (month, six weeks, or quarter), the terms and 
semester examination marks, and the final grade for the 
semester. In some schools cards are used in place of a 
record book. 
   
-P-A-G-E-381
  RECORDS AND REPORTS 365 
Pupil’s report card—The pupil’s report card to parents 
is commonly used throughout the country. It is issued 
at fixed intervals of a month, six weeks, or a quarter, and 
is sent home to be inspected and signed by the parent 
and returned by the pupil or parent. This card is one 
means of communication between the home and the 
school. It informs parents of pupil’s scholarship record, 
his attendance, deportment, industry, etc., and usually 
solicits the codperation of the parents concerning the 
pupil’s needs and best interests. Parents should be 
brought to realize the importance of taking a genuine 
interest in these reports. Where this is not done pupils 
cannot be expected to be greatly concerned about their 
markings or grades. Where it is done these markings 
usually mean much to the pupil. 
A full explanation of the system of marking should be 
printed on the report card to avoid misunderstanding. 
Permanent office record card—No school should fail 
to keep a permanent record of every pupil who has been 
in attendance in its classrooms. The record should 
furnish complete information concerning the pupil’s at- 
tendance and scholarship, and for making transcript of 
record both while the pupil is in school and after he has 
finished his school work. Most of the information given 
on the entrance enrolment card is usually transferred to 
this record. In many of the better schools the perma- 
nent office record now also gives a physical and a personal 
efficiency record of the pupil. The physical record shows 
various data on the pupil’s health and physical condition, 
while the efficiency record gives such data as the fol- 
lowing: punctuality, results of mental tests, school ac- 
tivities, and school honors. 
 
-P-A-G-E-382
    366 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
There is usually one office record card for the elemen- 
tary school career of a pupil and one for his secondary 
school career. In smaller schools where both elementary 
and high school work is given in the same building a 
single card is sometimes used for both. The permanent 
record card should be kept in a fireproof vault. If there 
is no fireproof vault in the school building, either these 
cards or the books and cards from which these records are 
made should be filed in a safe place in some other 
building. 
Admittance card—All schools should have blanks for 
readmitting to classes pupils who have been absent or 
tardy. In the high school these forms are usually filled 
out by the principal. In smaller schools where the grades 
and high school are in the same building and where there 
is no grade principal pupils from the grades, or from 
both the grades and high school, may be sent to the 
superintendent’s office for readmittance blanks in all 
doubtful cases. The blank should show the following: 
(1) name of pupil, (2) date of issue, (3) date and time 
absent, (4) excused, unexcused, or excused conditionally. 
(In case of a condition, such as time or work to be made 
up, this should always be definitely stated.) (5) initials 
of person issuing the blank. These blanks should be re- 
turned to the principal’s desk or superintendent’s office 
at the close of the day. They need be preserved for a 
short time only. 
Delinquency report—One or more forms for reporting 
delinquent or unsatisfactory attendance and scholarship 
are quite commonly used. In larger school systems it 
may be well to have two forms—one for reports from 
teachers to principals and one for reports to parents. In
-P-A-G-E-383
  
RECORDS AND REPORTS 367 
smaller schools a form may be used that will serve both 
purposes. 
The report should include the following: (1) the 
pupil’s attendance record, (2) subjects in which pupil is 
delinquent, (3) reasons for delinquency, and (4) recom- 
mendations for improvement. It should carefully and 
tactfully solicit the parents’ codperation in removing the 
cause of the delinquency and bringing about better 
results. 
Offense card—The offense card, or deportment card 
as it is sometimes called, is used for reporting misconduct 
or breach of discipline. It is filled out by the teacher and 
is sent to the principal or superintendent by the pupil, 
or it may be delivered to the proper person directly by 
the teacher at the close of the period or day. The card 
should give (1) the pupil’s name, (2) the date and time 
of day when the notice was sent or when the breach was 
committed, (3) what the pupil did or failed to do, 
(4) recommendation as to what was done or what the 
pupil should do to redeem himself. The writer has used 
for this purpose a perforated blank, the upper half of 
which is filled out by the teacher, after which the entire 
blank is sent by the pupil to the principal or superinten- 
dent who writes his recommendations on the bottom half 
of the blank and returns this by the pupil to the teacher. 
The principal or superintendent then files the upper half 
of the blank. Generally it will be necessary to use such 
blanks only occasionally and for very few pupils. Fhe 
The aim should be not to use them regularly or ex- 
tensively, but where their use seems advisable from time 
to time they are an effective means for dealing with mis- 
chievous pupils and troublesome parents. The pupil
-P-A-G-E-384
  368 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
knows that these reports are accumulating against him 
and the parents cannot well deny the charges, especially 
when they come from different teachers, as they usu- 
ally do. 
Grade sheets—At the end of each term or semester 
teachers of departmentalized work will need sheets or 
forms for recording their grades. These forms should not 
be smaller than 84% x 11 inches and should be so ruled as 
to provide for the periodic and final class and examina- 
tion grades of a semester, or of an entire school year. 
When the different teachers have entered their respective 
grades on these sheets they may be assembled and one or 
two teachers may then be required to enter the various 
grades of a class or group on the pupils’ report cards, 
while one or two other teachers are assigned the grades of 
another class or group. In this way all teachers can work 
independently and at the same time on their own grades, - 
and the burden of entering these grades on cards can 
be distributed among the different teachers. In some 
smaller schools all entries on report cards are made by 
the principal. At the end of the semester grades may be 
transferred directly from these sheets to the permanent 
office record cards. The grade sheets should also be filed 
at the close of the semester. From these a pupil’s schol- 
arship record can be readily reproduced in case the per- 
manent record card is destroyed or lost. 
Financial records—The financial records of a school 
system should show the property invoice of plant, equip- 
ment, and supplies, and the itemized receipts and ex- 
penditures. In smaller schools these records are practi- 
cally always kept by the secretary or clerk of the board, 
in books ruled for this purpose. The superintendent 
 
-P-A-G-E-385
RS FC Pe SAR Bre 9s ENE SSR: TER Ly SGC Oe ten or tee eae 
RECORDS AND REPORTS 369 
usually has little to do with the keeping of these records. | 
If he is to organize and manage the schools intelligently : 
and economically, however, he will need to do some cost 
accounting, and should make an annual report to the 
board or to the public. This he cannot do without fa- 
miliarity with and access to the financial records. But | 
as a rule the information he will need for this purpose 
can be easily obtained from the record books, if they 
are properly kept. 
All reports made to the board of a smaller community 
or to the public should be brief and clear, otherwise few 
people will read them. Whenever possible it is advisable 
to present the facts in graphic form. In many com- 
munities it is preferable for the superintendent to make 
his report to the board; and if it meets with their ap- 
proval, have it put out as the report of the board. This 
will avoid misunderstandings between the board and 
superintendent. 
A superintendent of a smaller community should be 
careful not to overemphasize the importance of highly 
refined cost accounting. Adequate records of attendance, 
achievement, failure, promotions, etc., should be kept 
and should be utilized to the best advantage of all con- 
cerned. But generally a community is more concerned 
about knowing that all pupils are kept busy at the work 
prescribed; that there is system and order; and that 
things are under control of a responsible superintendent 
than to know that the per pupil cost of teaching economics 
is 2 per cent higher than the cost of teaching ancient 
history. The public does not as a rule become alarmed 
over such information; and since no one knows what the 
relative value of a given subject is, such discrepancies do 
 
-P-A-G-E-386
  370 A MANUAL FOR SCHOOL OFFICERS 
not necessarily show where attention or remedial work is 
most needed. Where discrepancies are known to exist 
and are due to unjustifiable and remedial causes they 
should, of course, be adjusted. But generally greater 
economic advantages accrue from proper attention given 
to organization, administration, and supervision, pertain- 
ing to such matters as full-size classes, worth-while 
subject-matter, and efficient teaching methods than from 
time spent in obtaining exact knowledge of the relative 
monetary cost of a given subject. 
Budget making—A budget may be defined as a finan- 
cial statement showing an itemized account of antici- 
pated revenue and expenditures, usually for a fiscal year 
in advance. 
In smaller communities generally the cost of education 
is known or thought of only in terms of tax rates, and 
neither the board nor the superintendent know, except 
in a very general way, where the community is standing 
with regards to educational expenditures. They do not 
know how the total expenditure is distributed for the 
various purposes or how this distribution compares with 
that of other similar or typical schools and communities. 
Tax rates in themselves mean very little unless the 
methods of assessment are clearly understood. The tax 
payers of a community should understand the sources of 
revenue and the methods of taxation, as well as how 
their money is spent. They are entitled to this informa- 
tion, and it is through the budget that this can be brought 
before them in a simple and understandable manner. A 
budget carefully prepared shows in terms of dollars and 
cents the educational program or policy of the com-
-P-A-G-E-387
  RECORDS AND REPORTS 371 
munity. It shows the various sources and amounts of 
revenue and the relative proportions of the money spent 
for different purposes. 
The superintendent, as the agent of the board, is sup- 
posed to outline an educational program for the year and 
carry it out. It is important, therefore, that he take the 
lead in the preparation of a budget, and to do this he 
must have a definite and clearly conceived policy in mind. 
The estimates of money to be apportioned for each pur- 
pose will, of course, be based chiefly on past expenditures 
which may be determined from the various records and 
reports. There will be changes every year, however, due 
to changes in enrolment, organization, curriculum, ete. 
In making budget estimates it is well to collect and 
tabulate data from a number of similar or typical school 
systems. Strayer, in his City School Expenditures, rec- 
ommends the following distribution or apportionment of 
expenditures:

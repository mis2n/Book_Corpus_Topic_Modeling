JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 5 
AN EXPLANATION. 
The present Secretary of the Southern Educational Associa- 
tion will not attempt to enumerate the difficulties encountered 
in getting together the papers and other copy for this volume. 
He was elected Secretary by the Board of Directors after the 
adjournment of the meeting of the Association held in Chatta- 
nooga, December, 1910. The proceedings for 1909 had not been 
printed, and only a few of the papers read at that meeting, as 
well as the 1910 meeting, were turned over to him. 
The following circular issued by President Cassidy from Lex- 
ington, Ky., on March 18, 1911, explains itself: 
To Wuom It May Concern: 
Owing to the delinquency of the former Secretary of the Southern 
Educational Association, the proceedings of the Charlotte, N. C., meet- 
ing have not yet been published. It is the sincere desire of the present 
officers of the Association to issue, at the earliest possible time, both 
the Charlotte and the Chattanooga proceedings in two separate volumes. 
Because of an unwise and perhaps unwarranted expenditure of the 
Association’s funds by the former Secretary, the amount that can be 
expended on these publications is necessarily limited, and in order to 
meet the unpleasant—yes, embarrassing—exigency that has been forced 
upon the Association, it is found necessary to publish the papers read 
at Charlotte and Chattanooga in a greatly abridged form. This is 
much to be regretted, for, having read these papers, I am impressed 
with both their thought and style of presentation and am exceedingly 
sorry that each one cannot appear as originally written. 
It was at first contemplated, and was so ordered by the Board of 
Directors, that I should edit and condense all of the papers read on 
the two occasions referred to. The papers were sent to me for this 
purpose, but on beginning the work I was soon convinced that it was 
a task which no one could perform with satisfaction, either to himself 
or to the authors. It would be taking too much liberty with the fine 
thoughts of others. And upon mature refiection, I have concluded 
that in justice to the authors these excellent papers should be returned to 
them, and that they should be requested to rewrite them as briefly as 
possible. 
I feel sure of the cheerful codperation of each writer in this embar- 
rassing situation and earnestly request that he rewrite his paper, incor- 
porating nothing that is not absolutely essential to preserve the thought
-P-A-G-E-6

and unity of the production. In other words, make it as brief as 
possible. 
If each contributor will do this at once, and return the condensed 
production to Mr. Wm. F. Feagin, Secretary of the Southern Educational 
Association, Montgomery, Ala., at the earliest possible moment, the pro- 
ceedings will be printed as soon thereafter as possible and promptly 
sent to the members of the Association. Please bear in mind, in re- 
writing your paper, to preserve only essentials, to have the rewritten 
paper typewritten, and to return immediately to the Secretary at Mont- 
gomery, as stated in the previous paragraph. 
All who have not returned their papers by April 3, 1911, will be 
considered as not desirous of having them printed, since the proceedings 
must be in the hands of the printers not later than April 10, 1911. I 
beg to assure you that you will greatly assist us by complying promptly, 
if not cheerfully, with this request, and that no such contingency will 
arise after the next meeting. 
Assuring you of my gratitude and asking your hearty codperation for 
the future success of the Association, I am, 
With great respect, 
M. A. Cassipy, 
President Southern Educational Association.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON NECROLOGY. 
So far as your committee has been informed there have been 
few losses by death among the membership of the Association 
during the past year. A man long prominent among Southern 
educators, Supt. Warren B. Easton, of New Orleans, La., died 
early in this year. His long and able service in a position of 
such responsibility makes his death a notable loss to education. 
Your committee indulges the hope that succeeding commit- 
tees on this subject may find as little to report for many years 
to come. Respectfully submitted,

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS, 
The Southern educational Association in its twenty-first an- 
nual session at Chattanooga, Tenn., desires to express its 
thanks to the press, the teachers, the citizens, and the various 
organizations of the city of Chattanooga for the cordial hospi- 
tality and many courtesies extended to the officers and mem- 
bers of the Association. 
We reaffirm our conviction that to secure for all its children 
an equal opportunity for the fullest possible development along 
industrial, civic, intellectual, and moral lines, is the primary 
interest and highest duty of the modern democratic State; 
that the most just taxes imposed upon the people are those 
levied by the State, or by any smaller political subdivision with 
the authority of the State, for the establishment and main- 
tenance of public opinion. 
The Association expresses its gratification with the degree 
of progress made, and the results already achieved throughout 
the States of the South, in increased school revenues and school 
facilities, in the improvement of schoolhouses and grounds, the 
establishment of high schools and school libraries, and in the 
strengthening of the work of the normal school, the college and 
the university.
-P-A-G-E-23
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 23 
We view with approbation the extension of facilities for in- 
dustrial education to all classes of schools, but we indorse most 
heartily the efforts now making for the training in agriculture 
and domestic arts at public expense, of all pupils in the rural 
schools of the South, believing that such training is essential 
to the proper development of the individual, the happiness of 
the family, and the moral and economic progress of the State. 
We indorse all movements which have for their purpose the 
establishment of better sanitary conditions in the schools and 
homes of the people, and urge the codperation of teachers, phy- 
sicians and health authorities in the improvement of the health 
conditions affecting the youth in our schools. 
We appreciate most kindly the work of individual phi- 
lanthropists and voluntary organizations, and the work of 
our departments of agriculture, State and National, in the 
promotion of measures looking to the physical, mental and 
social betterment of all people; we would urge the importance 
of coérdinating the several agencies now at work with the 
policies and agencies of the several State Departments of 
Education, in order that unity of purpose and method shall 
be secured, and in order that unnecessary duplication and 
waste shall be prevented. 
We reaffirm our conviction that the highest educational, 
physical and economic welfare of the white people of the 
Southern States requires the proper education and training 
of the youth of the negro race. Under present conditions, 
the efforts of the State should be more largely and immedi- 
ately directed to the training of the negro youth in those prac- 
tical industries which directly affect his physical welfare, 
such as agriculture, gardening, poultry-raising, cooking, and 
the arts of thrift and economy. Instruction in hygiene and 
sanitation is of paramount importance. Unless the negro 
home is made clean and sanitary, our efforts to protect our 
homes from contagion and to eliminate disease from our 
cities and towns must remain futile. 
We recommend that in urban and rural negro schools there 
should be a closer and more thorough supervision, to the end 
that the instruction shall be more effective, and that the funds 
expended by the State shall not be dissipated through ineffi- 
ciency and neglect.
-P-A-G-E-24
24 SOUTHHRN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
We deplore the policy of many philanthropists in establish- 
ing private negro schools of secondary and college grade in 
many Southern communities. Such schools are usually 
isolated from the life and sympathies of the communities in 
which they are located. We believe that the most helpful 
and most efficient charity is that which works in codperation 
with the educational agencies already established by State, 
county and municipal authority. We recommend the super- 
vision by the State of all such schools, and urge that their 
work and their methods be adjusted to the real needs of the 
pupils, and the civilization in which they are to live, in order 
that the maximum good may accrue to the race and to society 
as a whole. 
We indorse the Dolliver-Davis bill, now on the calendar in 
the Senate of the United States, as a measure calculated to 
promote most effectively and practically the secondary indus- 
trial training of both races. 
Respectfully submitted, 
J. H. Pinups, Chairman.

RESPONSE TO ADDRESSES OF WELCOME. 
JOHN W. ABERCROMBIN, PRESIDENT UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA. 
Mr, Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: 
For the words of welcome so beautifully, so eloquently and 
so sincerely spoken, it gives me genuine pleasure to express the 
heartfelt thanks of the officers and members of the Southern 
Educational Association, an organization that stands for the 
educational uplift of the fairest domain on earth. The privi- 
lege and the honor of making this response, I prize most highly. 
Sirs, the greatness of your State, the progress of your city, 
the beauty and accomplishments of your women, the bravery 
and intelligence of your men, and the gracious hospitality of 
your people are not unknown to us. Before coming to Tennes- 
see and Chattanooga, we had heard glowing reports of your 
superior natural resources, of your commercial and industrial 
achievements, of your educational and religious institutions, 
of your grand mountain scenery, of your parks, battlefields and 
monuments, and of your numerous other advantages, natural 
and acquired. But, after listening to these delightful wel- 
coming addresses by your respresentative citizens, we are con- 
strained to conclude that the half had not been told. 
What is true of Tennessee and Chattanooga is true in large 
measure of each of the States and cities represented in this 
Association. In the natural resources of climate, soil, forests, 
minerals, and streams, “the South has been favored by heaven 
o’er all the world beside.” We are lacking in one thing, and in 
one thing only—a citizenship adequately trained to utilize 
wisely and in fullest measure the countless natural advan- 
tages with which we have been blessed. 
In other words, our progress in education, except here and 
there, has not been such as to render possible the highest and 
best of development, social, commercial, industrial, and govern- 
mental. The returns from the census of 1900 disclosed an 
alarming and discouraging educational status in the South- 
ern States, and we look with fear and trembling for a publi- 
cation of the disclosures of the census of 1910, though we have
-P-A-G-E-29
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 29 
good reason upon which to indulge the hope that the new 
census will show material educational advancement. 
What are the factors necessary for the best development of 
the public school system of a State? The history of education 
teaches us that there are several, among which may be men- 
tioned : 
Competent Administration. 
Adequate Revenues. 
Compulsory Attendance. 
Let us consider briefly these essentials. That which is funda- 
mental cannot be disregarded without serious and disastrous 
results. 
COMPETENT ADMINISTRATION. 
No person should be legally eligible for election or appoint- 
ment to the position of Superintendent—State, county, city, 
or district—who is not a professional educator of experience, 
of recognized ability, and of high character. 
The office of Superintendent should not be regarded as a 
political one. Under the excitement of partisan contests, the 
matter of qualification is frequently overlooked. The result is 
inefficient supervision. This office should be removed as far as 
possible from the influences of what is commonly called prac- 
tical politics. 
So long as it is possible for appointment or election to the 
office of Superintendent to be secured by unqualified men, by 
men who are not experienced in school administration, who 
know nothing of the history of education, who have not made 
a study of the theory and practice of teaching, who could not 
pass a credible examination even for the lowest grade of 
teachers’ certificate—just so long will we have incompetent 
school administration. So long, too, as we follow for political 
reasons the practice of forcing out of office at the end of one 
or two terms competent Superintendents, just so long will the 
cause of education be hindered. 
A qualified superintendency is one of the greatest of our 
educational needs. Indeed, many believe it to be the greatest. 
Superintendents and teachers should be well qualified, and 
should be paid salaries sufficiently large to enable them to de- 
vote their entire time to their work. Their compensation 
should be sufficient to render it possible for them to live com-  
-P-A-G-E-30
  30 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
fortably, to spend an adequate portion of time in making bet- 
ter preparation for service, and to accumulate a reasonable 
competency. 
ADEQUATE REVENUES. 
Without adequate funds no system of schools, whether it be 
State, county or district, can be efficiently administered; and 
this is true, however competent may be the administration. 
In most of the States of the South the school systems have 
been inadequately supported. The wonder is that so much has 
been accomplished with such meager revenues. 
If we are to perform successfully the task undertaken, the 
State, the county, and the district must contribute, each in pro- 
portion to its interest and ability. In some of the States we 
have relied too much upon the State for support, and to that 
fact must be attributed the chief cause of their failure to make 
satisfactory progress in education. 
This feature has lead people to rely upon the central State 
government for revenues, rather than upon community interest, 
in initiative and effort. The history of educational develop- 
ment in other sections proves that this policy is unwise and 
ineffective. The result of such a policy is this, invariably this, 
that the people come gradually to look to the State govern- 
ment for the performance of duties which should be regarded 
as local. 
The right of local self-government is a principle for which 
the people of the South have always contended, yet in the mat- 
ter of providing educational advantages for their children, it is 
a right which the fundamental law of some of our States de- 
nies to their citizens. This constitutional inhibition should not 
be permitted anywhere longer to exist. No State can raise ade- 
quate funds without providing for State, county, and district 
taxation. Those that have made greatest progress have relied 
most upon the interest, the initiative and the support which 
spring from county and district tax levies. 
COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE, 
If, as we agree, the preservation of free institutions depends 
upon the general intelligence of the people, all children should 
be required to attend school an adequate length of time. The
-P-A-G-E-31
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 81 
parent who performs his duty sends his children to school. 
The parent who fails to do this voluntarily should be made by 
law to do it. 
If it is the State’s duty to prepare its children for the obliga- 
tions of citizenship, the State should possess and exercise every 
power necessary for the performance of that duty. Free public 
schools at governmental expense and compulsory attendance 
laws follow each other as naturally as the night follows 
the day. 
Shall the State sacrifice the citizen and endanger its own 
efficiency and stability by permitting children, through the neg- 
lect or cupidity of unnatural parents, or through the avarice 
and inhumanity of grasping corporations, to grow into man- 
hood and womanhood, dwarfed in body, mind and soul? Such 
a policy is nothing less than social and governmental suicide. 
CONCLUSION. 
These, ladies and gentlemen, are some of the problems which 
are being considered by the Southern Educational Association. 
While each of the States in the Union is confronted with simi- 
lar problems, conditions in the South, social, civic and 
economic, have been and are such as to render their solution 
most difficult. We have had no lamp of experience by which 
to guide our foosteps. The history of education furnishes no 
parallel to the problems which are peculiar to our section by 
reason of the presence of the negro. 
We indulge the hope that our meeting with you at this time 
will result in a renewal and a strengthening of our determina- 
tion to pursue until accomplished the task to which we have set 
ourselves. We know that our sojourn among you will be full 
of pleasure and profit to each of us, and we trust that it may 
not be without interest and benefit to you and yours.

[ABSTRACT OF PAPER. ] 
MORAL TRAINING IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
PRESIDENT D. B. JOHNSON. 
WE are giving much attention to industrial education, man- 
ual training, commercial training, the study of agriculture, and 
all vocational training in the public schools these days, and 
very properly so. I stand for these subjects in my school and 
State. But I hope we shall not allow our interest in these or 
any other school subjects to cause us to lose or lack interest in 
the most vital work of the schools—moral training or character 
building. If the schools should do successfully everything else 
demanded of them and still fail to produce upright, honest, law- 
abiding, public-spirited, moral, responsible, dependable citizens, 
they would fail miserably in their duty to pupils, State, and 
society and could not justify their existence. Education alone 
does not necessarily make a better man or a better citizen. “It 
may graft upon the wolf the qualities of the fox.” 
There has long been unanimity of opinion practically among 
leaders of thought everywhere that character is the chief end 
of education—that the primary aim of our public schools is to 
educate the children for moral success and social efficiency—to 
prepare the individual for complete living. And yet there are 
many evidences that the public schools are not giving adequate 
moral instruction, and in many public schools little thought is 
given to moral training, and in most of them no definite ar- 
rangement is made for it. 
There are those who insist that definite, formal moral and 
religious training should be left to the home and the church; 
that the schools have all they can do properly to teach the three 
R.’s—to attend to the intellectual development of their pupils 
—that there are too many “frills” and “fads” now in the 
schools to think of adding another on “moral training.” The 
home and the church should not be relieved of their respon- 
sibility in this matter in any sense, but the home and the 
church do not seem to be able to do this work alone—the home 
often is not dominated by right ideals; is not equipped for 
moral training, and the church reaches a small proportion of

the people. Out of a total child and youth population of 
24,000,000 in this country the Sunday schools enroll only 12,- 
000,000, and these 12,000,000 do not attend the Sunday schools 
regularly, and those who do attend regularly are under the in- 
struction and influence of the teachers usually for one hour 
only during the whole week, and these teachers are ordinarily 
untrained and inexperienced. The public schools have practi- 
cally all the children for twenty-five hours in the week—the 
main occupation of children is going to school—and unless the 
schools do something definite for the development of character, 
it will not be developed in a vast number of children, the citi- 
zens of tomorrow in the making, and the schools will fail 
of their chief mission. The schools furnish the proper 
conditions for character development, which is mainly 
a social process—companionship, stimulus, example, language, 
and ideas. The “hen with one chicken” idea is not best for hu- 
man beings. Where there is only one child in the family he 
does not usually receive satisfactory home training. There 
seems no good reason to deny that “the moral-social element in 
school life is more vital and valuable than the intellectual ele- - 
ment,” and that for this reason “the schools should give first 
place and consideration to character-development in children.” 
The State must rest for its safety and stability upon the char- 
acter of its citizens rather than upon their intelligence and 
skill, and hence it is absolutely necessary for the State, for its 
own welfare, to make provision for moral training in the publie 
schools as well as for intellectual and physical training—hence 
the duty of the State’s schools to train for good citizenship. 
This seems to be the view now of the enlightened leaders of 
thought in all civilized countries. 
The National Educational Association has stood for it for 
some years. The Religious Education Association is a national 
organization which has for one of its aims the improvement of 
moral instruction in the public schools. The Character De- 
velopment League of New York City is national in its scope and 
work. The subject of moral education is a world problem and 
is engaging the attention of all the leading nations. Clifford 
W. Barnes, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Inter- 
national Committee on Moral Training, tells us that “Godless 
France, as it is sometimes called, turbulent Italy, and even the 
3

free-thinking cantons of Switzerland, do not consider it safe, 
and much less wise, to get along without the direct and posi- 
tive teaching of morality and the rights and duties of citizen- 
ship.” The strength and uninversality of the demand for moral 
education in the public schools is shown in many ways, but in 
no way more convincingly than in the International Moral Edu- 
cation Congress held in London in the fall of 1908. 
“The whole child goes to school,” and the whole child—physi- 
eal, mental, and moral—must be ministered unto. All educa- 
tion must take account of the three H.’s, the head, the hand, 
and the heart, as well as the three R.’s. Moral education is not 
another fad, nor need it add to the already overburdened cur- 
riculum. It can be given in the regular management of the 
school and in the teaching of the regular studies to the great 
improvement in the management and the teaching. “Charac- 
ter is not something apart from knowledge and skill.” Obedi- 
ence, honesty, thoroughness, truth, fairness, order, punctuality, 
perseverance, self-reliance, courtesy, self-control, courage, the 
spirit of service, love of the good, the beautiful, and the true 
should be the fruits of the management and instruction of every 
good school. I say good school. For the influence of the man- 
agement and teaching of a school might be anything but moral 
—depending more than anything else upon the method and 
spirit of the teaching and management—upon the ideals and in- 
centives in force in the school. “Clear right thinking is neces- 
sary to right acting.” As a man thinketh in his heart so is he. 
Some studies lend themselves better than others to moral train- 
ing—such as the humanities, especially history and literature. 
The vocational subjects, such as manual training, domestic 
science, etc., develop self-reliance, steadfastness of purpose, 
constructive ability, and the like, and by bringing real life close 
to the school should prove helpful in solving the problem of 
moral training in the public schools. 
The lowest incentive of the school is fear of punishment. 
Judge Ben B. Lindsey, Judge of the Juvenile Court, Denver, 
Col., says that the “threat of a mother to turn the child over 
to the policeman or jailor has, in his opinion, started as many 
criminal careers as any mistake ever made. But I would not 
advocate the entire abolition of the rod in school or home. The 
hope of reward, however, is a better incentive—reward in grad- 
  
ys

ing, school honors, the approval of teachers, parents, and fellow- 
students. 
Moral training may be given through direction of plays and 
games. It has been said that the great battles of England were 
won on the playgrounds of such English schools as Rugby. 
_ Self-government, student-control, the school city, the Junior 
Republic, study of biography, good reading, are all agencies for 
character-building—for ethical training. One of the best ways 
to make moral teaching both direct and concrete is by the study 
of biography. 
A system of prefects, or class tribunes, is used in some schools 
for teaching self-control. “One boy and one girl are chosen by 
each class from its membership, and these are responsible for 
the order of the class, and all of them collectively for the order 
of the school as a whole during the recitation period, on the 
playground, and on the way to and from home.” 
Some advocates of moral training in the schools contend that 
it should be given systematically in accordance with an out- 
line or text-book or syllabus similar to that used in France. 
Others hold that it should be given indirectly and incidentally 
as at present in most schools where given at all—that more 
harm than good results from a didactic teaching of morals. 
The injunction, “Be good,” does not accomplish much by itself. 
Children get more from what they overhear than from what 
they hear. The story of George Washington and the cherry 
tree, though it may be a myth, has done more to secure truthful- 
ness in children than all the admonitions to be truthful. 
Dr. G. Stanley Hall advocates definite, formal instruction in 
morals to supplement the moral influence of the schools. 
The Committee of the N. E. A. on Moral Instruction in the 
public schools has prepared a tentative course for use in the 
schools. This committee recommends “that this course be 
modified as may be found necessary to meet the needs of dif- 
ferent localities, and that definite instruction be given from 
time to time. Such moral instruction has proven highly bene- 
ficial in France, in Japan, and in almost every country where 
it has been tried under favorable conditions.” * * * “But 
instruction alone is not sufficient. Every school should be so 
organized and so conducted as to furnish numerous opportuni- 
ties for moral training daily. A moral atmosphere should per-

vade the whole school. The surroundings should be clean, at- 
tractive, and wholesome; the relation between teacher and 
pupils frank, kind, and considerate; the spirit of industry, 
loyalty, friendship, and helpfulness should pervade the whole 
school. Under such conditions moral growth on the part of the 
pupils is rapid and certain.” 
“A Course in Moral Instruction for the High School,” by 
Frank C. Sharp, of the University of Wisconsin, has been used 
with success. 
Illustrated lessons in morals have been prepared by Mr. Mil- 
ton Fairchild, of Chicago, Ill., under the direction of the Moral 
Educational Board of Baltimore. The titles of these lessons 
are, for high schools, “The Gentleman,” 100 slides; “Personal 
and National Thrift,’ 100 slides; “The True Sportsman,” 100 
slides; for upper grammar schools, “What I’m Going to Do 
When I’m Grown Up,” 70 slides; for lower grammar schools, 
“What Men Think About Boys’ Fights,” 50 slides. These slides, 
accompanied by a printed, illustrated text, are sent by express 
to all parts of the United States at a normal charge. 
Under the direction of the Character Development League of 
New York City, Mr. James T. White has prepared “Character 
Lessons in American Biography” for the grades from the first 
through the eighth. The Golden Deed Book, in which pupils 
record deeds illustrating the various traits brought out in 
“Character Lessons,” adds much to the interest and value of the 
lessons. This plan for moral training has been used with suc: 
cess in the Lexington, Ky., city schools. 
Supt. Brumbaugh, of the Philadelphia, Pa., public schools, 
has worked out a course for moral instruction in the Philadel- 
phia schools. 
There are those who hold that true morality has its root in 
religion and in the Bible, and that it cannot be taught properly 
except through religion and the Bible. Time is given in the 
schools of England, Germany, Hungary, Austria, and some 
other countries for religious and moral training, and with ex- 
cellent results, it is claimed. One of the teachers sent to Ger- 
many under the “exchange arrangement” made by the Carnegie 
Foundation reports as follows with regard to moral training in 
that country: 
“The general tone is noticeably high. Classes left for long

periods without teachers conduct themselves well. Lying, petty 
thieving, and various forms of cheating, so distressingly preva- 
lent in many large city schools in America, are much less preva- 
lent in Prussian schools. * * * 
“It is by no means impossible to attribute the real cause of 
good moral standing to definite instruction in morals. The 
teachers treat the subject with breadth and good sense. The 
children early become familiar with the stirring tales of Old 
Testament history, and the smaller boys often take real delight 
in the subject. For the older boys the study of the Bible forms 
a practical basis for the discussion of ethical theories.” 
We have a separation of church and State in this country, 
but that does not mean the exclusion of unsectarian religion 
and the Bible from the public schools any more than it means 
that proclamations for Thanksgiving shall not be made by the 
President of the United States and the Governors of the States, 
or that chaplains shall not be appointed for the army and navy 
and the halls of Congress. There are elements in religion that 
are not sectarian and the Bible does not belong to any particu- 
lar church, 
The public schools of New England were established to edu- 
cate the children of the Puritans mainly that they might be 
able to read the word of God, and even after the separation of 
church and State in Rhode Island, following Roger Williams’ 
exile from Massachusetts, the use of the Bible in schools was 
not considered sectarian. 
“Huxley, though an agnostic, always said that the best book 
in the world for the teaching of morals was the Bible.” 
The great need of religion, unsectarian, of course, and of the 
Bible in the public schools has led to an effort on the part of 
some leaders in Protestant and Catholic Churches to agree upon 
certain universal elements of religion without sectarianism for 
use in them. Faith, hope, and charity, in morality and religion 
alike, should be taught. The Golden Rule belongs to both reli- 
gion and ethics. 
I am thankful that the Bible is freely and generally used in 
the public schools and State institutions of the South, and that 
there is no thought of excluding it. 
I would not dare to be responsible for the well being of the 
students of any institution of learning without the aid of the

moral and religious influences of daily devotional exercises at 
which the Bible was read, of a strong Y. M. C. A. or Y. W. C. A., 
and the local churches. 
After all is said and done, the most important agency for se- 
curing moral training in the public schools is the personality 
of the high-minded, devoted teacher. Actions speak louder than 
words to everybody, but especially to children. Gladstone has 
well said, “One example is worth a thousand arguments.” 
To secure moral training for the schools we must secure 
teachers of the highest character for them. In selecting 
teachers we must consider first, character, then teaching abil- 
ity, and then scholarship. We must see to it that our best 
men and women teach, and to this end, that the social position 
and rewards for the teacher are equal, to say the least, to those 
of other callings and professions. 
Just here | wish to say that I do not believe any profession 
has a greater proportion of high-minded, patriotic, devoted, 
able men and women in it than that of the teaching profession. 
The normal schools must train and inspire their students for 
moral training. 
Tn closing this presentation of the question of moral train- 
ing in the public schools, I wish to say emphatically that I 
believe the world is getting better, not worse. This great 
movement for moral education in the schools, with other 
great philanthropic movements of the day, is both an evidence 
and a result of the world’s moral growth.

A PLEA FOR MODERN LANGUAGES IN THE NORMAL 
SCHOOL. 
L, R. DINGUS, FLORENCE, ALA. 
THe successful teacher in the grades and in, the high school 
needs many accomplishments, leaving out of account the com- 
mon but necessary virtues of honesty, fairness and the like. 
Four essentials are (a) a general academic training; (6) a 
professional training; (c) natural aptitude for teaching, 
coupled with an innate love for young restless growing life;
-P-A-G-E-39
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 39 
and (d) in the case of high school teachers a special technical 
training in the particular subjects taught. 
No institution of learning can fulfill its proper mission 
unless it adapts itself readily and heartily to the conditions 
and times of which it is an integral part. In my judgment, 
this alone is reason enough justifying the establishment and 
maintenance of the supplementary academic department to 
accompany and codrdinate itself with the professional. 1 
would even go one step farther and say that our State Normal 
Schools are fulfilling their mission only in so far as they 
realize this present educational need and make their academic 
department the strongest possible, going ever hand in hand 
with the strictly professional. ‘To do or to see otherwise is 
indicative plain and simple of ignorance as to present day 
educational conditions and needs. 
Here in this connection I want to make a special plea for 
modern languages in the normal school. Their study has 
grown rapidly in recent years, so rapidly that the pedagogy 
of the subject has not kept pace with the growth in popular 
interest in the study itself. As a consequence, there ave many 
handicaps to the successful teaching of the subject and as well 
to the efficiently trained teacher who offers courses in German 
and French, handicaps that must and will be removed in the 
future. : 
There is now no college or university of reputable standing 
in the whole country that is not offering courses in these 
languages. Further, every reputable institution of learning 
in the country offering to do post-graduate work in whatever 
branch of knowledge—the sciences, history, literature or the 
classical languages—requires a minimum of a reading knowl- 
edge of French and German. Private academies, institutions 
coming under the general head of secondary schools, offer 
courses in modern languages as regular parts of their curric- 
ulum. The city high schools all over the land also have such 
courses; in many cases specially trained and equipped 
instructors for these subjects the same as for the sciences, 
the ancient classics and mathematics. The State of Alabama 
is organizing in each county what she calls county high schools, 
and in these a modern language is a regular part of the curri¢- 
ulum.
-P-A-G-E-40
40 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
. Modern languages are now made a part of the entrance 
requirement to the colleges and universities on a footing 
similar to the sciences, history, etc., and with perhaps a half 
dozen exceptions.a modern language may be offered in lieu of 
one. or both of the classical languages. We of the South have 
not yet felt this change and have not adopted it so widely as 
in some other parts of the country. However, it is coming 
to us and it is only a question of time until it is here. 
The very fact that these subjects are taught in our public 
schools is in itself reason sufficient for having them in our nor- 
mals, to which the School Boards must more and more turn to 
get their teachers. 
But we are not confined to this alone. There is abundant 
warrant and worth in the subject itself, and this in its final 
analysis must justify the existence and the continuance of any 
subject in our school courses. The mere fact of mental dis- 
cipline is no warrant for the introduction or the continuance of 
any subject in our curriculums. Any study carefully and 
thoroughly taught by a competent instructor has in it dis- 
ciplinary worth. Which subject has most of this virtue, and 
which least, always will depend in a measure on the way it is 
handled. 
Now so far as my plea at the present moment is concerned, 
the modern languages have no more to do with the ancient lan- 
guages than they have to do with science or history, but I am 
using the illustration of Latin at this point to show you his- 
torically what I mean. Throughout the Middle Ages the Latin 
tongue was the one universal language known by all scholars 
and taught in all the schools whether in England, Germany, 
France, Italy, or the Spanish Peninsula. It was the language 
of the church, of diplomacy, and of the scholar. It had already 
a literature, a definite form, a vocabulary of wide application 
for the exact expression of thought and capable of being under- 
stood in any land. The various modern languages were at that 
time dialects—languages in the process of formation—without 
definite or fixed form of expression, without a literature, and a 
very limited vocabulary of a localized or provincial application. 
There was then nothing else to do but to turn to Latin, if the 
German or .the Englishman had any scientific or philosophic 
ideas to express, or if he was to be understood outside of his
-P-A-G-E-41
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. AL 
own locality. As these various dialects gradually assumed a 
more definite and fixed form, acquired a somewhat national 
character with something of a native literature and a more 
adequate vocabulary, there developed everywhere a conflict be- 
tween the precise scholarly Latin and the restricted vulgar na- 
tive tongue—a conflict which lasted for centuries, in which 
every inch of vantage was contested, but which resulted in 
every case in a complete route of the Latin in favor of the vul- 
gar dialect, now grown into a respectable and honorable lan- 
guage, holding its own treasures of beauty and truth. 
Having lost in this unequal fight, the defeated, but not con- 
quered, classicist faced about and for some generations more 
successfully defended his position with the argument that a 
knowledge of Latin was an indispensable mark of gentility and 
respectable culture. When this position became untenable, 
then he said Latin is an invaluable discipline for the mind; it 
is necessary for the right understanding of English. In these 
later years he has again shifted and has now boldly and, I 
think, wisely taken the position that the study of Latin has its 
chief value within itself, and on this ground alone he is willing 
to let his subject stand or fall. Here the Latinist is right. 
Intrinsic worth is the only and final unshakable ground of 
justification for any subject taught in our schools. To this test 
must every subject ultimately come, and here is where I am 
willing to rest my plea for the study of French and German in 
our public schools and in‘ our normals. 
If you will only stop for a moment and consider it frankly, 
the reasons justifying the study of our own English language 
with a little readaption, will warrant the examination and first 
hand acquaintanceship with French and German. These three 
countries in the last several centuries have occupied the most 
conspicuous places in the world of thought, of action and of 
literary execution. These three nations, and, as a consequence, 
these three languages, still hold their high position of interest 
and worth. Each nation has its own great literature, worthy 
of reverence and study on the part of the other. Each possesses 
its own peculiar genius which it manifests in the doing of its 
work and the handling of its material, whether this be literary, 
scientific, political, or military. No great scholar or scientist, 
no great historian or political economist would now think of
-P-A-G-E-42
    42 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
undertaking or performing a great piece of work without ac- 
quainting himself at first hand with what has been done along 
similar lines in other countries than his own. Never in the his- 
tory of the world have the nations been so close together in 
sympathy and hope; never has one State so well understood 
and appreciated other States; never has the welfare, peace and 
prosperity of one nation been so dependent on the peace and 
prosperity of other nations as in the time in which we live. 
The dreamer of dreams can almost look forward and see the 
world as one union of States made up of various interdependent 
nations. 
How has all this change come about? What can contribute 
more to it than a sympathetic understanding and appreciation 
of the past and present of the other? What is the study of 
French and German but a step more in widening our own indi- 
vidual horizon, extending our own knowledge and sympathies, 
acquainting us at first hand with the best and noblest and most 
beautiful that these great nations have thought and done? 
To me these are ample reasons for justifying the placing of 
French and German in the curriculum of our high schools and 
as well in our normals, for the teacher needs all the culture, all 
the breadth and strength to be had in order to do his work. 
Coupled with this is the additional fact that the mastery of the 
forms, syntax and vocabulary of these languages is relatively 
easy enough so that a thorough high’school course should make 
an understanding and appreciation of their literatures feasable. 
Here I am not thinking either of the immediately practical 
use that the teacher can put his special knowledge to. This, 
however, is worthy of consideration. The demand for compe- 
tent instructors in these subjects grows with each year. The 
Teachers’ College is not much alive or very aggressive; is not 
living up to the full limit of its usefulness if it neglects these 
very important matters of fitting teachers to do well the work 
they are called upon to do. In addition to the above, the busi- 
ness man or woman will find such knowledge invaluable in 
many places, and for purposes of travel in the old countries, a 
little French or German will be an open sesame to many an 
embarrassment. 
In the early part of this paper I referred to the handicaps 
modern languages have to contend against. I wish now to speak
-P-A-G-E-43
ee ee

more particularly of some of these. One objection which, like 
the poor, we have always with us, is that the curriculum is al- 
ready too full. All this may be wholly true. I am not here 
either to affirm or to deny the accuracy of the statement, but I 
do call in question the validity of the objection. This is the 
argument the “ins” always make to the “outs” when all else 
has failed. You who make this objection must first show that 
the curriculum is so full of subjects of universally greater value 
that nothing may be added, nothing may be eliminated or sub- 
stituted, and that no consideration is to be made of the personal 
aptitude or predilections of the boy or girl. 
Again modern languages being comparatively a new subject 
in our high and normal schools, there is lacking any standard 
of proficiency. There is no background of experience or tradi- 
tion that furnishes a satisfactory basis by which to estimate 
either the quantity of quality of work to be done, such, for ex- 
ample, as exists in the case of history, literature, or Latin. 
And as a ready corollary inferred from the above, is the great 
dearth of efficient modern language teachers. If the modern 
language teacher is at all to approximate the requirements laid 
down or outlined by thoughtful students of the subject, to ap- 
proach the ideal no nearer, but just as near as the average 
teacher of history, science, Latin, mathematics, then there is a 
greater need for a special training to do this work acceptably 
than in the case of the other subjects mentioned above. Too 
often it happens that the modern language work is alloted to 
whosoever has time for it. If this particular teacher happens 
not to have any knowledge whatever of the subject, a course in 
some summer school will give him the start of the class, and 
by dint of daily preparation of each lesson he is able to keep 
ahead of his pupils. 
Such a condition has contributed doubtless more than all else 
to the not uncommon idea, especially among pupils, but largely 
with parents, that modern languages are easy. Such a condi- 
tion has likewise, alas! too often brought the subject into the 
state of semi-respectability it has acquired in certain circles 
and with a few educators. Perhaps these pupils and parents 
in unconscious irony mean that to know as much French or 
German as the teacher in question knows is easy, and there 
they are right. I am not sure, but it is my candid opinion, that 
 
-P-A-G-E-44
  44 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
more harm is done in this way to the subject and to the pupil, 
who, under such conditions, takes up French or German than 
if he remained in absolute ignorance of the language. 
However, only a moment’s glance is needed to brush aside 
forever any such ideas, that any language is easy. To compre- 
hend and appreciate properly the English language has taken 
any one of you long years of diligent effort. Now the monu- 
ments of French and German, as the languages through which 
these versatile and virile nations have expressed themselves, 
even if in different words, yet with no less fervor and variety 
of form, must require equally diligent and long continued ef- 
fort so to comprehend and enjoy that one can truthfully say, 
“They are easy.” 
What is greatly needed is a standard of efficiency and pro- 
ficiency on the part of the modern language teachers in our high 
schools. One way to bring this about is to require any one 
proposing to teach these subjects to pass an examination in 
them as is required in other subjects. Another is to train these 
teachers specially to do their work. I think no subject taught 
in our high schools and colleges has in the last two decades un- 
dergone such radical changes in the way of handling the subject 
in the classroom as have modern languages. To meet these 
changed requirements, and to do this teaching efficiently, calls 
for adequate equipment. This is a great deal more than to con- 
jugate correctly the irregular French verb or to learn the 
strong and weak declension of the German adjective and to 
translate the original texts into English. 
The one institution in our whole educational system theoreti- 
cally competent and actually constituted to do this kind of 
work is the normal school. This manifest duty they should see 
and do. This many of them are seeing and providing for. All 
must and will, for modern languages have come to stay.

[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
A DANGER IN TRYING TO MAINTAIN THE CARNEGIE 
STANDARD OF COLLEGES. 
R. L. BLACKWELL, ASHLAND, VA. 
Tue establishment of the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad- 
vancement of Teaching marked an era in educational develop- 
ment in the South. I am not sure that its pension system will 
induce abler men to go into the profession of teaching. When 
a young man decides upon his profession, he can hardly con- 
ceive that he will ever be sixty-five years old, and it would be 
unnatural for him to think that he will ever be in need of a pen- 
sion. But it may well keep many able men in the profession, 
for when men do begin to find that they will get old and that it 
will be necessary for them to lay up something for the future, 
then it is that the dreary prospect of years with barely enough 
salary when they are at their best to keep the wolf from the 
door tends to drive the most vigorous of them out of the pro- 
fession into some more remunerative calling. The Carnegie 
Foundation by its pension system will do a great amount of 
good in keeping this vigorous class in the profession. 
Tt will be helpful in another way. When teachers get too old 
to be really effective, institutions that are not able to retire 
them keep them often ten or more years in their chairs simply 
for the good work that they have accomplished. Now all this 
time the students are suffering for a lack of vigorous teaching. 
In retiring these old teachers so that younger men may take 
their place, the Carnegie Foundation will be of substantial 
benefit to the cause of education. 
But there is a by-product of the activities of the Carnegie 
Foundation which has been and will continue to be for years 
even more helpful still to education. Over large sections of the 
country, when the Carnegie Foundation came into existence, 
there was chaos in our educational system. The colleges and 
universities were accepting students who should have been in 
high schools and many even who should have been in elemen- 
tary schools. The result was that the growth of high schools 
was greatly retarded. The consequence of this unhappy condi- 
tion, when there was no line of demarkation between high 
 
-P-A-G-E-46
  46 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
school and college was that the colleges were not able to give 
a good education, because they were dealing with some pre- 
pared students and very many unprepared students, and thus 
year by year, there was “a slaughter of the innocents” carried 
on by all our colleges and universities. But those students 
whose education was ruined by going to college too soon, and 
those whose education was retarded and rendered less effective 
by having to be taught along with unprepared students were 
not the only ones who suffered from this chaotic system; for the 
students who can get no education except what they can get at 
home are ten times more numerous than those who are able to 
go off to college. Without high schools these nine-tenths got 
no education beyond what the elementary school gave them. 
As soon as the colleges under pressure of the Carnegie Founda- 
tion refused to take students without a high school training, 
the influential and ambitious people in the community, who had 
hitherto been relying on the colleges to give this training, be- 
came insistent that high schools should be established capable 
of preparing for college, and the establishment of high schools 
made it possible for the nine-tenths who formerly got only an 
elementary education to get the equivalent of two years of 
college training of former times. The Carnegie Foundation has 
thus, by causing the colleges to raise their standards, conferred 
benefits on thousands of pupils that never give a thought to 
Mr. Carnegie and have never heard of his pension scheme. 
But in our hurry to meet the conditions laid down for a 
standard college and a standard high school, we are running 
great risks. 
Our college entrance requirements demand that the newly 
built high schools of the South shall teach as much as the older 
and better equipped high schools of New York and other sec- 
tions of the country. The result is that most teachers are apt 
to rush their students over all the ground required for entrance 
to college whether they can be taught it thoroughly or not. 
The college thus finds that it is not doing much better work 
than before the standard was raised. For the situation is 
pretty much as it was originally—very many of the students, 
though having gone, in some manner, over all that was 
required of them, are just as unprepared as was formerly 
the case. In fact, in many instances, the situation is
-P-A-G-E-47
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. AT 
worse, for the student has gone so far that it is almost 
too late to teach him what he should have been taught years 
before. What are you going to do with pupils who have read 
all the four books of Cesar, the six orations of Cicero and the 
six books of Virgil, but who cannot translate a page of the 
simplest Latin without a translation? 
When a student has thus gone through a three of four years’ 
course in which there has been no real training of his mental 
powers, it is too late to begin to educate him in these subjects. 
If he gets any real education at college, it will have to be in 
subjects that he commences there. 
There is then a very real danger in raising standards, if it be 
done too rapidly and without due regard to local conditions. 
The danger is that by forcing the high schools to attempt to do 
more than they can do they will turn out students with un- 
trained minds and vicious mental habits. 
What then is to be done? Should we go back to the old plan 
of allowing the colleges to maintain preparatory classes? By 
no means. Differentiation of function is essential to growth in 
our educational system. But we should insist on quality of 
work rather than quantity. We should find out how much our 
schools can do well and allow them to confine themselves to 
that amount. To do two books of Cesar, four orations of Cicero, 
and three books of Virgil with painstaking care is worth vastly 
more than to attempt twice as much and do it in a slovenly and 
unstudentlike manner. By proper codperation between the col- 
lege and the high school this matter can be rightly adjusted. 
As it is now, we are in danger of graduating from our institu- 
tions mere smatterers, with little mental discipline and with 
vicious habits of study.

ARTS AND CRAFTS IN THE SOUTH—THE FUTURE. 
MRS. D. W. READ, LYNCHBURG, VA. 
In speaking of arts and crafts, I refer to fine arts, and to 
manual arts in general in whatever medium expressed, and for 
whatever purpose designed; also art education in our public 
schools, colleges and universities. 
 
-P-A-G-E-48
  48 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
We will review what we have today in the way of art achieve- 
ment. 
We have many examples of good architecture in our churches 
and public buildings and many more which stand as monu- 
ments to bad taste. 
Again and again we see examples of the good, near good, and 
the worst in art and architecture occupying such relative places 
as would point to equal appreciation by the people. 
We have in our public halls paintings done by masters, and 
near them may be found those which convince us the dead can- 
not rise until the last trumpet, or they would surely come forth 
in protest against such effigies. Pieces of old furniture, charm- 
ing to the eye of a connoisseur, may be found doing duty with 
a highly ornamental product known as “stained oak.” 
There are in our midst many amateur workers in the minor 
erafts, china painters, lacemakers, embroiderers, and those who 
go down to the graves with pyrographic points in their hands. 
These and many others. Some are artistic and some are not, 
some show craftmanship to a pleasing degree, and others fail, 
yet we see in it a desire to express conceptions of beauty 
through color and design. 
There can hardly be found a woman in the South who does 
not make some attempt at “fancy work,” crude or artistic, ac- 
cording to her culture and training. I have seen factory girls 
crocheting at rest periods. There is a kind of primative crafts- 
manship among the “poor mountain whites.” 
We have an innate love for the beautiful in the South. It 
comes from the flowers and sunshine, which is ours so abun- 
dantly, and from an ancestry of cathedral builders, tapestry 
weavers and mural painters of centuries past. We love all 
things beauitful, and only need to train and develop this to see 
it blossom into wonderful flowers of industry. 
What is being done for it? Is there a school for arts and 
crafts in all the South, free to every one who can enter? Is 
there an endowed art school in any of the Southern States? 
Is there any art school in the South which has not had a sad 
struggle to live? 
Has any philanthropic soul given a penny to further art edu- 
cation, that the standards of taste may become higher for all 
the people? 
 
-P-A-G-E-49
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 49 
True, we have statuary, memorial windows and mural deco- 
rations, in a few favored places, and these are the beautiful 
things which belong to the general public everlastingly and 
make for appreciation of art. 
Many here can tell the sad story of the first reactionary in- 
fluences upon the South from the war between the States, and 
ean also tell the remarakble story of the evolution of a con- 
quered people from distress and poverty into what now seems 
an assured ascendency in the industrial world. 
Of the West, it is said, those progressive people have been 
too much engaged in making a country to develop a school of 
painters, or to project any great art movement, as yet. 
In the South we have had before us the task of rebuilding 
and remodeling a ruined country, and we’ve had the work of 
readjusting ourselves to new conditions, and the obligation of 
rearing our children in the spirit of making a new South 
greater than that of the boasted past. 
Until late years we have had little time or money for cul- 
tural things, however much the inherited love for them. 
If we would bring art appreciation to all the people, we must 
begin with the children. 
What are we doing in our public schools? 
We have in recent years witnessed an educational awakening 
which has set astir school activities in various directions, and 
with this has come the drawing lesson and the manual train- 
ing work, as a foundation for industrial education. 
These have caused many a child to love school, and given 
teachers, as a support, subjects upon which to base their efforts 
in instruction. 
Teachers know the value of drawing in schools, they know 
they can teach it through all things around them, and teach allt 
things around them through drawing. They know the value of 
manual training; they know it makes for ability to interpret 
directions, spoken, written or drawn; it makes for accuracy in 
construction and gives every child an opportunity to use such 
creative powers as is placed within him. 
Teachers understand these things, but how about school 
boards? 
In some localities these guardians of their country’s good 
stand against manual arts as a waste of time and a useless ex- 
penditure of money.

In many towns and counties manual arts are included in the 
course of study, but no special supervisor is provided for the 
work, and no fund is set aside for expenditures in materials. 
No section of our country needs the training which comes 
through manual arts more than the South, and I believe there 
is no section which would show more response and apprecia- 
tion in a short time, if such opportunity were given to all the 
children. 
The Southern white child has never yet had a chance—except 
in a few cities—to use his powers in constructive and creative 
motor training. 
I once met a Western friend in a hotel in a Southern city 
who said he was there to deliver an address upon “Industrial 
Education for the Negro.” I could not help saying, “While 
you are before that audience, I pray you don’t fail to speak, 
also, of the thousands upon thousands of white children in the 
South who don’t know and never will know how to use their 
hands.” 
We, as a people, are accused of showing evidences of a lack 
of hand training, and a want of ability to make correct esti- 
mates, and a failure in clear conceptions in manual activities. 
This may be true of the adult, but Southern children in 
schools show no lack of industry and enthusiasm, nor do they 
lack ability to execute; they measure equally with those of 
their ages in Northern and Western schools, and frequently 
show more artistic feeling in their work. 
In places where they receive good instruction in drawing and 
manual training grade by grade, and through the high school 
and the shop, they average well with the usual American child 
in any section of the country; just as intelligent, and just as 
aceurate in their work. 
Are we, as Southern people, working out our educational, 
social and industrial problems to fit our needs? 
I once visited a growing town in a Southern State, a town 
with many furniture factories, and plants for turning out 
building materials by the car load. 
The superintendent of the town schools was a progressive 
man and a student of the people. He had asked for a super- 
visor of manual arts and for a shop for manual training, but 
had failed to get them; he was discouraged, for he recognized
-P-A-G-E-51
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 51 
what the main spring of education should be in that place, and 
had found no codéperation with his school board in the matter. 
I asked one of the leading women of the town if they had a 
woman’s club there. “Oh, yes,” was the reply, “and we have 
such delightful literary work; we are now traveling with 
Dickens through Kent Country, England.” 
I thought they might as well stay there, so far as they would 
assist that superintendent in educating his board into the right 
attitude towards industrial education. I asked a man if there 
was a commercial club there. He said, “Yes, and we are 
hustlers; we never let a business enterprise pass us; we have 
just given $5,000 and a site to a new industry to induce them 
to come here.” 
That was a town of cheap furniture manufacturing, and of 
ready made building materials, and not a boy in its limits was 
getting anything to improve the output of those factories. Not 
one was studying design as applied to work, not one was pre- 
paring to carry anything in the way of artistic improvement 
to those factories. 
I thought of the great opportunity there for linking school 
and town industries and for bringing about a community life 
of coéperation which, as an example, might influence that 
state, and the entire South. 
We have great opportunities for school and industrial 
coéperation in our towns, for there is so much home material 
at hand. 
The pottery clays of Georgia and the Carolinas will, I hope, 
some day be a means of codperative school and community 
work in some of the towns of those states. 
It is time we take hold as an entire people. The teachers 
can lay the foundations, but the school patrons, professional 
men, bankers, farmers and captains of industry are needed in 
the move, as supports, that our land may realize a new indus- 
trial intelligence. 
Here is a broad field for club women, a worthy cause for phi- 
lanthropist and a rich theme for students of sociology and 
economics. 
The instinct of art and craftsmanship is here; no one can 
visit and study our schools without being impressed with this; 
and no one can visit the old Southern cities without under- 
standing whence came such instincts.
-P-A-G-E-52
  52 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOUIATION. 
When this is made knowledge, through training, we may 
expect to have artists and artisans in our midst. 
We are an expressive people, and such have been the subtlest 
artists and craftsmen of all ages. 
An art education is the rightful heritage of every child, for 
this is an education which reaches beyond the school room, and 
which he takes to his home in refined tastes, and means a 
knowledge of the beauties and uses of material things. 
We need not only to educate the producers but the consumer 
as well. 
The Southern child is ready for an art education, the educa- 
tion which makes for trained hands, eyes and senses, and when 
this is given, there will be a future for us, in which a new dig- 
nity in labor will be felt, and a new pride in the quality of the 
work of our hands, and there will be a higher moral education 
through this, and a new industrial spirit will make for what 
is best in every man and woman. 
The world’s history has been delineated in arts. 
Every race has told their story through the work of their 
hands. 
May the day come when the South will tell a new story and 
a greater story through her industries than she has ever told 
before. 
A story of raised standards of taste, of perfection in designs, 
and crafts, and of a developed industrial intelligence which 
none can claim to excel.

ART IN EDUCATION. 
MISS LOUISE J. SMITH, RANDOLPH-MACON COLLEGE, LYNCHBURG, VA. 
A MAN of culture is sensitive to impressions, observant, sym- 
pathetic, and yet has a potent personality capable of original 
deeds. The aim of instruction in drawing is culture through 
the senses by which we apprehend the forms of things. The 
ends to be secured are sensitiveness to beauty, an intelligent 
appreciation of beautiful things, the power to make things 
beautiful and to reveal beauty to others.
-P-A-G-E-53
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 53 
To compass such ends a course in drawing must be shaped 
upon the broadest lines; beginning with the simple notions, 
the vague concepts, and crude tastes of the child, it should 
gradually unfold for him the world beautiful; finding him im- 
potent in graphic expression, it should develop his latent 
powers to their utmost. Art has been woefully neglected by 
us as a nation, but we cannot afford to do so any longer. 
There is a strong, growing demand for it, and it is our duty 
as educators to see that proper instruction be given and that 
all humbug and deception under the mantle of art be done 
away with. It is not surprising that our friends who have 
not studied art are prejudiced against it, as many educators 
are because so many daubs have been made under the name of 
“art,” when hundreds of students have been allowed to carry 
home from “Female Boarding Schools” large and wonderful 
pictures copied by the students with “finishing touches” from 
the teacher’s brush. But these pictures, if such they may be 
called, have been “hand painted” by precious hands of be- 
loved children, and I assure you in these homes a Raphael, a 
Velasquez, or a Leonardo da Vinci would be skied in their 
favor. Oh, let us stop such prostitution of art! I often won- 
der what can be the parents’ object in having their children 
taught such trash. If they really want them to learn art they 
should know that that is not art; if it is for the purpose of 
getting pictures for the home let me suggest that if they would 
invest the money, which was designed for their daughter’s 
painting lessons, in Copley prints, Braun’s photographs, or 
any good reproduction of masterpieces the artistic atmosphere 
of that home would be raised fifty per cent. 
Every child should be taught to draw and paint as he is to 
read and write that he may better express himself, for, after all, 
the power of education lies in the true expression of ourselves. 
At first, children should be given a quantity of different col- 
ored paper with a pair of blunt scissors and allowed the liberty 
of independent Americans. Later, they should have instruc- 
tion but so tactfully administered that the little ones are not 
conscious of being taught. They should be carefully instructed 
in well graded exercises from the time they enter school till 
they leave. 
Some fifteen years ago the Virginia Board of Education
-P-A-G-E-54
  
  54 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
adopted a resolution requiring drawing to be taught in the 
public schools, but I am sorry to say, that in most cases it has 
fallen into “nocuous desuetude.” 
It does not seem appropriate to give here an outline of the 
work from year to year as might be done for a board of educa- 
tion, but the desired and natural results may be suggested. 
High school graduates should be able to draw and paint 
interesting clusters of flowers, model in clay fruits and vege- 
tables such as apples, potatoes, etc.; to make creditable designs 
for wall paper, ceilings and borders, calicoes, oilcloth, ribbons, 
eravats and stuffs of various kinds. They should be able to 
make passable compositions thereby becoming familiar with 
many of the principles which underlie all good art. Above all 
things they must be taught to do original work and they should 
never be permitted, much less encouraged, to copy pictures or 
their teacher’s technic. Every conscientious teacher must real- 
ize his duty toward students along this line. If there were 
five hundred children here and I were to give the same leaf to 
each child every drawing would be as different as the five 
hundred faces and temperaments. If there be one thing which 
we all value more than any thing else it is personality. We 
love our friends because of the possession of that something 
which makes them different from others. Just here lies the 
root of so many failures. People are not satisfied to be them- 
selves and are ready to throw to the winds the most precious 
gift God has given them and sell their birthright for a mess of 
pottage. Let us spare no pains to develop this selfhood! We 
should have teachers trained for this work. Until we do, we 
may not hope for better results. However, it is a sad fact that 
in many cases where teachers are capable of teaching from 
objects, nature and life, public sentiment still demands that 
they teach what they know to be false. Nevertheless, is one ever 
ever justified in teaching what he knows to be wrong? 
In our academies, seminaries and institutes, the students 
should be drilled in casts till they are able to draw heads and 
busts; and paint in water colors or oils, studies of flowers, 
fruits and other still-life subjects. It is often advisable to have 
students of this grade use pastels as their medium for color 
work, since its application more closely resembles that of their 
charcoal work. They should be able to sketch from nature and
-P-A-G-E-55
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 55 
make original compositions showing now an understanding 
of the laws which underlie this work. In response to letters 
to the principals of the majority of such schools in Virginia, 
I have not heard of a single institution where copying is for- 
bidden; though I am glad to say that some are realizing the 
importance of original work and are using their influence to 
promote it. Unfortunately, but comparatively few States can 
boast of better work outside of special art schools. 
Art teaching in college should begin where the academy 
finishes, that is the students should begin on busts and full 
length casts and continue this in connection with life works 
for the first year, sustaining the interest now and then with 
appropriate work in color. Afterward their work should be 
entirely from life, enabling them at the end of their college 
course to paint a creditable head. Their composition should be 
of a much higher grade, not only must they express knowledge 
and ability, but sentiment as well. I am sure that our friends 
who have charge of other departments would be glad to extend 
the hand of welcome if they felt satisfied that serious art work 
was being done in all schools and recognize art as degree work 
in college. When this is done much will be gained toward 
establishing an appreciation of true art. Let us look into it 
and see why this should be done. It is not fair that those 
whom God has destined to be artists should be forced out of 
college when they long for a broad education because of this 
prejudice which exists on account of the before mentioned 
daubers. 
We so often hear it said that musicians and artists are not 
educated along other lines. Those who say that, surely have 
never known a real live master. I often wish that all of us 
could know some of the greatest artists and see how such men 
are honored in the old country. Even if it were true that our 
artists are not educated, it would be no wonder since there are 
such few institutions in our dear land, as far as I have been 
able to ascertain, where one can get both classic and artistic 
training on the same footing. Every one knows that no one 
expects to use in life the exact mathematical problems learned 
in college; but rather it is the power which is gained by the 
concentration and effort necessary to master them that gives 
them their educational value. To paint a simple study properly  
-P-A-G-E-56
56 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
one must have his power of attention so trained that he may 
seem to attend to many things at the same time. Should his 
attention slack so there be one false note, why the whole is 
false—this is what we call values. No one would say that 
such work does not give mental training. <A college President 
once was lamenting the fact that his professors magnified their 
own departments and were unwilling to consider education as 
a whole. “Therein,” said I, “they show a lack of art training, 
for had they been drilled in values they would know the im- 
portance of keeping each thing in its proper’place in relation 
to. others.” College influence is good for us, and more than 
others art students need such surroundings during this period 
of their lives. Some educators, who have not studied art feel 
that they have done their whole duty when they say to stu- 
dents, “Stop your art till you finish your college education and 
then you can specialize in it.” If that be best for the student, 
then take art out of the college at once. It would be fairer 
than to pretend to have it there kept down as it is. But it 
should be there, I think, as an elective that those who feel 
drawn to the arts may get an appreciation and understanding 
of art by taking such a course without being afraid of becom- 
ing artists just as no one nowadays would consider himself a 
mathematician or an author for having completed college 
courses in mathematics or English. Yet no one would say that 
a prospective mathematician should not be allowed to have any 
mathematics in college just because he intends to make it his 
profession, and all professional training should be gotten after 
college days. Everybody, I believe, should have some knowl- 
edge of art though few should become artists, but certainly 
those few should not stop their work for the four years of col- 
lege life. 
Those who think deeply upon such subjects say that 
America will be the next art centre in the world. It is freely 
talked of in Paris that the strongest students in the art schools 
are Americans. One of the most famous Parisian art critics 
told me that there was no doubt in his mind that America 
would be the centre of art when France looses that honor. 
“Why,” said he, “the American men are our strongest students. 
Even a prize student who came to us from the south of France, 
where he had been taught by one of our own professors, is sur-
-P-A-G-E-57
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 57 
passed by many American men.” He asked why our men were 
such hard workers? “There are many reasons,” I said; “first 
it is simply a natural manifestation of the energy and grit of 
” a new country in whose people the blood of many nations is 
mingled; then, too, our men have another stimulus. There is 
nothing which our women value more in our American men 
than the very qualities which they gain by hard work.” He 
expressed great surprise and said he was more sure than ever 
of our success. We may have confidence in the opinion of 
those who are recognized authorities and rejoice that our 
country will some day have this honor though none of us may 
see it. However, the character that American art will have 
depends upon what we do for it now. We so often hear it said 
that French art is depraved in thought (often ignorantly ex- 
aggerated) though clever and strong, and that English art, as 
a whole, is pure in thought, but tiresome and not strong. 
What we want is to avoid the faults of both. No man has the 
power to paint a picture by himself for all the influences which 
surround him and have surrounded his ancestors contribute to 
that picture. If we be indifferent to the influences of our 
young people we are laregly responsible for what they will 
produce. 
I have a plan for accomplishing something in this direction 
and feel unusually fortunate in having an opportunity of talk- 
ing about it to this assemblage. As has been said before, I 
think all public schools and academy students should be re- 
quired to do some drawing and color work and that college 
students should be allowed to have genuine art work as an 
elective. Yet every one must know that if students can see 
only what they have done that their appreciation of art is not 
to be envied! Therefore I should like to see the walls of the 
public school and academy filled with good reproductions of 
masterpieces; and in college I want an annual loan exhibition 
open from one to two months free to all students. This ex- 
hibition must contain only good work, and I have been assured 
by some of the most distinguished Parisian and American 
artists that such work may be secured with proper influence 
where we have the means to bear all transportation expenses 
and insurance against damages. Of course, this exhibition 
might vary from ten to one hundred pictures according to our
-P-A-G-E-58
  58 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
means, but there would be no excuse for having a single piece 
of bad work. An artist, or some one capable of judging, should 
go to the Salons, art exhibitions and visit private studios and 
ask for only the very best. As an inducement to these artists 
to lend their pictures it should be understood that each year 
the best pictures should be bought for a permanent collection 
which will belong to the college. At the same time I would 
like to have in another room an exhibition by amateurs open 
to all contributors whose work was of sufficient merit to be 
accepted by a competent jury. My object would be to raise © 
each year the standard of our amateurs. For this reason I 
would like to offer several prizes in their department. With 
such exhibitions in colleges where there are from two to fifteen 
hundred students who are giving from three to four years of 
their lives to education I can guarantee that an enthusiastic 
capable teacher can create among these students an apprecia- 
tion of art which will naturally increase with their develop- 
ment. 3 
This has never been tried in any school or country, as far 
as I know, but I have spoken of it privately to many educators 
whose hearty appreciation has strengthened me in my desire 
to see this executed. I think more good would be accomplished 
by having such an exhibition in a college than in a city. For 
if you have often visited our Corcoran in Washington or Metro- 
politan in New York you know that a majority of the visitors 
pay hurried little visits of from one half hour to an hour and a 
half, which time is often spent looking at the worst work in the 
gallery, should it chance to represent some sentimental subject, 
else much of the time is spent in looking at the other sight- 
seers, and just before leaving two or three glances are given to 
works of art as a parting gift, after which they go out into 
the world feeling capable of commending or condemning pic- 
tures. Not for a moment do I mean to say that we should not 
have public collections in our cities. On the contrary I should 
like to see every city own one. May we not in the future look 
to our politicians to bring this about? Then each city could 
boast of a good collection. If we could, during our student 
days, get the proper knowledge and appreciation of art we 
would at maturity be capable of deriving real pleasure and 
benefit from good public collections. The plan which I have
-P-A-G-E-59
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 59 
given you for securing an appreciation of art among our col- 
lege students will naturally require much money, and I can 
only hope to see it perfected by donations for this purpose from 
generous individuals who love culture and art in all its 
strength, truth and beauty and want to give it to our young 
people that their lives may be happier and more useful. 
If you knew the struggles, heartaches and temptations of 
the host of American art students in Paris as I do, having 
studied there seven years, you would leave no stone unturned 
to satisfy, in our own land, this longing desire of our young 
people for real art training. The natural progress of the na- 
tion demands it, and our people could not help it if they would, 
for the power of a nation’s development governs individual 
will. If the history of our nation may be foreseen by the light 
which other nations give us we may know that our influence 
will last longest through our art. It is hard in this rushing 
progressive age to realize that the time will come when we 
shall be valued by what we have been, but it seems to be the 
law under which we live. Since artists must play such a 
prominent role in the history of our country it is most impor- 
tant that they should live surrounded by our best national in- 
fluences that they may perpetuate the true American spirit. 
It is however a sad fact that many of our artists are forced 
out of their country and even from the bosom of their families 
on account of a lack of support and sympathy in their work. 
Because of these facts I make a plea that art be recognized as 
an elective in college so that artists may have not only the intel- 
lectual benefit of the literary and scientific courses, but also 
the moral infiuences of proper college life at the time when 
character is being moulded.

CITY SCHOOL ARCHITECTURE. 
N. R. BAKER, ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT BIRMINGHAM SCHOOLS. 
To Begin with the beginning the location should be away 
from noise and noisome odors, though as near the center of the 
district as possible. Condemn a block if necessary and make 
plenty of room. Grade buildings should be eight to twelve

blocks apart. For a large high school building the BE, or 
hollow square, form is best for ground plan. For small 
high school or grade buildings the H form is better. This be- 
cause of the ease with which it is lighted and heated, and the 
facility afforded for completing but part of the building at 
first if necessary, and making additions later. 
But it is best to make the buildings as large and complete 
as possible at once, so as to forestall the activities of any 
future petty alderman who may desire a school building in 
his own particular ward ostensibly for love of the children, but 
virtually to boom real estate. 
Do not call for competitive bids from architects. The aver- 
age architect knows little constructing a proper school build- 
ing. Study this subject when you go to build till you know 
what you want and can express your ideas not in technical 
language or detail, but so that a good architect familiar with 
modern schoolhouse construction can understand and con- 
struct such a building as you would want. 
It was formerly customary by means of towers and gables 
and steep roofs to make a schoolhouse look as much as possible 
like a church. It is now considered that schoolhouse archi- 
tecture should show straight lines, right angles and a flat or 
low roof. 
The grade school should be provided with an assembly room 
to accommodate four to eight hundred pupils. The high school 
fifteen hundred (1,500). More than this would fail without 
the compass of the average child’s voice. Then there should 
be a spacious gymnasium, an airy library, wood-working shops, 
sewing, domestic science, and lunch rooms, and even a labora- 
tory and museum in the grade building, as well as a more ex- 
tensive one in the high school. 
The unilateral lighting system is best, though there may be 
upper half-windows at the rear. No windows should be placed 
in front of seats. They should be 3 1-2 to 4 feet from floor and 
banked closely together, and allowing a light space equal to 
one-fifth to one-seventh of the floor space. 
One of the most perplexing problems is that of heating. In 
some building the mechanical steam blast, has proven success- 
ful. But the most satisfactory heated building known to the 
writer is one equipped with such a plant supplemented by a  
-P-A-G-E-61
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 61 
direct steam system governed by thermostats. The value of the 
plan in that the building is thoroughly ventilated by the air 
plant, even though as a heat plant it might fail. Steam alone 
does not ventilate. If in addition to this a humidifier is added 
the plant is complete. A humidifier is really a paying proposi- 
tion as by making the air of the schoolroom as humid as the 
outside air, children will be as comfortable at 65 degrees as 
without it at 70 degrees in the dry, parched air of the furnace 
or steam blast. 
Adequate lavatory and toilet facilities should be provided at 
the ratio or about one fixture to twenty pupils. Stairways 
should be ample, but not too wide. Where six hundred pupils 
are upstairs there should be three stairways at least four feet 
wide. This will enable six rows to come down at a time. If 
the stairway is too wide there might be temptation to send 
three or more rows down together. This is dangerous, as the 
middle lines have no support. Very wide stairways, however, 
may have a double center rail, thus allowing four lines to pass. 
Many other things might be mentioned, such as translucent 
shades for sunny rooms, sanitary drinking fountains, slate 
blackboards, fireproof halls, sound-deadened floors, fire exit 
doors opening outward, cloakroom, ventilation, etc. The walls 
above the blackboards and wainscote and the ceiling should 
receive a rough sand finish, and should be decorated in soft 
flat tints without gloss, those allied to brown or tan pre- 
ferred.

COMMUNITY WORK IN THE RURAL HIGH SCHOOL. 
DICK J. CROSBY, SPECIALIST IN AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION OF THE 
U. S. OFFICE OF EXPERIMENT STATIONS, 
Two rmportTantr public school problems confront us: First, 
that of getting more of the children of school age into the 
schools, and keeping them there longer and more regularly; 
and second, that of making the school equipment available for 
other people in the schoo! district when it is not used to its 
full capacity by the school children. The first of these prob- 
lems, that of lengthening the school year and of securing a
-P-A-G-E-62
62 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
larger daily attendance of pupils, does not come within the 
scope of this discussion. It is already commanding the thought 
and active effort of nearly every person concerned with the 
administration of school funds. The other question, that of 
making the school funds and equipment contribute to the edu- 
cation of all the people, is less well known, and, so far as the 
rural people and their schools are concerned, it falls within 
the limits set by the title of my paper—“‘community work in 
the rural high school.” 
In American rural districts the development of continua- 
tion courses and community work in general has awaited the 
development of real rural high schools—those located in rural 
towns and villages or out in the open country, and giving in- 
struction in agriculture, home economics, and farm and home 
mechanics. As long as the rural high school taught only the 
traditional high school subjects, and according to popular esti- 
mation, performed its full duty in preparing a few studiously 
inclined pupils for college entrance, there was no demand for, 
and little opportunity, to develop community work. But with 
the coming of special teachers of agriculture, home economics, 
and manual arts into a few rural high schools there has come 
a new conception of the function of such schools, a conception 
not bounded by narrow pedagogical dogmas, but by broad lines 
of effective service encompassing the whole community—the 
children in school, the young people just out of school, the men 
and women on the farms, and the teachers and pupils in the 
neighboring elementary schools. Few of these special teachers 
have had the time or opportunity to put into practice com- 
munity work for all the classes of people just mentioned, but 
nearly all of them have undertaken it with one or more of these 
classes. 
Some of the forms of community work which have been suc- 
cessfully practiced in rural high schools may be mentioned 
briefly under five heads: (1) Work with farmers, as winter 
lecture courses on agriculture, corn and potato shows, field and 
orchard demonstrations, home experiments, good seed distribu- 
tion, seed and milk testing, preparing plans for buildings, and 
selecting and purchasing improved live stock and farm ma- 
chinery; (2) work with farm women, as afternoon or evening 
meetings and short courses at the school, house to house meet- 
 
-P-A-G-E-63

ings, and home garden and poultry experiments; (3) work 
with young people, as short courses in agriculture, home 
economics, and shop work, literary societies, and nature-study 
clubs; (4) work with rural school teachers, as meetings for 
agricultural instruction, nature-study rambles, attendance at 
school fairs and rallies, and outline lessons in agriculture and 
home economics published in local educational journals; and 
(5) work with rural school children, as boy’s agricultural 
clubs, girls’ domestic science clubs, summer vacation encamp- 
ments, rural improvement field days, and athletic field days. ~ 
All of these forms of community work have been carried on 
in various parts of the country by agricultural high schools 
or rural high schools connected with agricultural departments. 
Several schools in this country have recently undertaken com- 
munity work in a systematic way. A plan which has been in 
successful operation a little over a year in the Agricultural 
School of Baltimore County, Md., contains several admirable 
features. 
This school is located at Sparks Station on the Northern 
-Central Railroad, and is immediately surrounded by open 
farming country. It is not in any sense a town or village 
school, but a rural consolidated school with elementary and 
high school courses. The principal of the school is an agri- 
cultural college graduate who came to his position with the 
idea of doing some form of educational work for every class of 
people in the district. He is assisted by regular grade and 
high school teachers and by special teachers of home economics 
and manual arts. Pupils living at a distance from the school 
come and go by trains, and private conveyance, or are carried 
in school wagons, of which there are four. 
Before the school opened the principal was in the county 
getting acquainted, and one of the ways he had of accomplish- 
ing this was to prepare a card index of all the names of rural 
people he could get from the subscription lists of county pa- 
pers, poll lists of voters, membership lists of farmers’ clubs and 
granges, and account books of physicians, lawyers, real estate 
dealers, etc. Invitations were sent to 3,000 of these people to 
attend the dedicatory exercises of the school, and so many 
came that the exercises had to be held out of doors. About the 
same time posters, telling what the school had to offer, ap-
-P-A-G-E-64

peared all over the county, on trees, postoffices, blacksmith 
shops, schools, and churches. These posters and all subsequent 
ones used by the school were printed in the school colors, red 
and white, and it soon became known that whenever posters in 
these colors appeared the school had something new and good 
to offer. 
The community work began almost as soon as the regular 
class work, with monthly meetings for rural teachers, several 
of whom came long distances. At these meetings there were 
morning lessons on school methods and administration given 
by experts furnished by the county school authorities; a basket 
luncheon with hot coffee or tea served by the high school girls; 
and afternoon lessons on agriculture. The meetings were not 
very successful owing to transportation difficulties and bad 
weather, so as soon as winter set in they were discontinued. 
The next feature of community work to be started was a 
series of ten evening lectures for farmers, one a week, on the 
general subject of soils and fertilizers. There was no previous 
demand for this sort of thing, and many of those who came 
out of curiosity aroused by a new crop of red and white pos- 
ters did not expect to attend regularly. The lectures were very 
elementary and very practical, with numerous laboratory tests 
and demonstrations by the lecturer. Mineograph outlines of 
each lecture were distributed, and those were made the basis 
of quizzes and reviews. The first lecture was attended by sixty 
persons, the second by ninety, and so on up until the average 
for the entire course, in good weather and bad, was 125. The 
venture was an unqualified success, and at its close a County 
Corn Congress was held at the school, with 180 exhibits, six 
sessions addressed by a dozen of the best speakers from the 
Maryland Agricultural College and the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, and nearly 1,000 persons in attendance, 
who came both days and stayed from morning until night. 
For the women, a series of monthly meetings was held on 
Saturday afternoons. Using the card list, postal cards were 
sent out to 300 women living within driving distance of the 
school. The three school wagons were run over the regular 
routes to bring them to the meetings. Thus many women who. 
would have been unable because of the farm work to secure a 
man and team to take them to the school were enabled to at-
-P-A-G-E-65
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 65 
tend. Each meeting opened with a short general lecture by 
some person of prominence and ability, and this was followed 
by music. Then the women divided into four groups, which 
were self-chosen and continuous throughout the year. One 
group took cooking under the domestic science teachers; an- 
other went to the shop and learned to use the saw, hammer, 
plane, and other tools—no need to wait now for their husbands 
to find time to put up shelves or make chicken coops; another 
group took homecrafts work—chair caning, rug weaving, In- 
dian basketry, stenciling, ete.; and the fourth studied modern 
literature. These meetings had an average attendance of 
eighty-five, and were considered very successful. 
A literary society was formed for young people in the neigh- 
borhood who happen to be too old to go to school. The society 
meets once in two weeks and has a membership of about 100 
persons who pay dues for its maintenance. Spelling bees, de- 
bates, and other so-called literary exercises are held and serve 
to engender a better neighborhood spirit while enlivening the 
long winter evenings. 
During the summer the school conducts experiments on the 
home farms of its pupils. All boys in the high school depart- 
ment are expected to perform at home an experiment of their 
own selection during the summer vacation. This is in order 
to bring the work of the school to the people at large as well 
as to emphasize concretely the instruction of the winter in the 
mind of the student. The experiments, scattered over a terri- 
tory twenty-five miles long by five miles broad, attract much 
attention among the neighbors, and are in an efficient demon- 
stration of agricultural ideas. They range over many subjects, 
according to the choice of the student. Many are variety tests 
of corn from seed furnished by the school, the corn being grown 
under modern methods by the student. Other students are test- 
ing herds of dairy cows, weighing and recording the milk at each 
milking and making frequent Babcock tests of the butter-fat 
content. Some students are growing an acre of alfalfa, while 
still others conduct a variety test of cowpeas or of popcorn. 
The experiments are closely watched from the school, the prin- 
cipal visiting them frequently during the summer and advising 
the students concerning them. This brings the principal in 
touch with the home life of the students and gives the boys 
5
-P-A-G-E-66
  66 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the impetus necessary, sometimes, to carry on a flagging ex- 
periment. 
This, in brief, is the community work of one rural high 
school, and the principal writes that the work has not been 
unusually difficult, “nor has it disclosed obstacles which make 
it prohibitive for any school anywhere. On the contrary, the 
work has proved easier than seemed possible and more success- 
ful than appeared probable. Many of the dilemmas conjured 
up by pessimistic advisers never materialized.” This experience 
in a small school with small funds, a small building, a few 
acres of land, and a small, but enthusiatic and well-trained 
faculty, leads us to believe that many well-to-do rural com- 
munities, by codperatitng with the State agricultural colleges 
and other agencies, can have similar schools, with almost un- 
limited possibilities for rural uplift. And when this belief and 
this hope of ours is realized, I wonder if we shall not find that 
our other public school problem—that of getting more chil- 
dren into the schools and keeping them there longer—has also 
been solved for those schools.

COMPULSORY EDUCATION. 
G. F. MILTON, CHATTANOOGA, TENN. 
For me to speak before this audience on the subject as- 
signed, is, indeed, like carrying coals to Newcastle. I know I 
shall not be able to add anything to the knowledge of the mem- 
bers of the Association on any educational question, and my 
sole purpose shall be to confirm you in your faith and, if pos- 
sible, encourage you to further efforts in behalf of the cause 
which you hold most dear. 
My question is not that of securing the school. It is not 
that of securing the teacher to teach the school. It is not that 
of the training of the teacher or the support of the school. My 
question is the elementary, and yet, I think, the vital one of 
securing the child for the school; and once put there, of keep- 
ing the child in the school. 
I have never worried as much over the problems of higher 
education of technical schools, of school buildings and appa-
-P-A-G-E-67
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 67 
ratus, as of the question of elementary education. I know the 
importance of those first mentioned, but I have always felt 
absolutely confident that just as soon as we could start the lit- 
tle feet trudging every morning toward the schools, we should 
secure the buildings, trained teachers, apparatus, and finally 
the colleges, universities, technical schools and all the con- 
comitants of the school systems which exist under the highest 
civilizations. The supply will meet the demand. No Governor, 
State Legislature, or local government, can resist the appeals 
of the little children. No civilized community will long deny 
a desk to every child who comes to school. Some more, no 
doubt, will be induced to attend school if the advantages are 
improved, but most rapid progress, I feel sure, will be made if 
there is the army of unprovided-for little ones standing out- 
side the school door appealing for admittance. 
So I have felt for a long time that the vital problem of edu- 
cation in the South is to secure the attendance of more of the 
Southern school children and with such attendance once se- 
cured the other problems will be more rapidly solved. Such 
attendance may, no doubt, be brought about by offering better 
schools, but nothing like a full attendance can be secured in 
such manner. 
We need legislation on the subject. But legislation not sup- 
ported by strong public sentiment is less effective than legis- 
lation which is felt by nearly all to be necessary. 
Do not gather from what I have said, or may say, that I do 
not realize the progress along educational lines, which has al- 
ready been made in the South. Much noble work has been done. 
I know of no profession where a greater self-sacrifice is ex- 
hibited than that of the teacher. The average emolument of 
the Southern teacher is less than that of the day laborer. If 
the average teacher of Tennessee worked the average number 
of days at the average salary he would earn only $158.40 a 
year. Yet Tennessee pays better salaries than some other 
Southern States. Many of the greatest men of this country, 
and of the South, have been teachers. Many others trace their 
first desire to drink deep at the Pierian spring to the inspira- 
tion of some school master or ma’am. That the accumulation 
of wealth is not their sole object in life, has been proved a thou- 
sand times over by the examples of the conscientious and
-P-A-G-E-68
    68 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
painstaking instructors of youth who do their noble duty for 
duty’s sake. e 
That, considering the amounts expended, and the difficulties 
overcome, the educational movement in the South has been 
successful, has been shown in many ways. The reduction of 
the percentage of illiteracy by 1900 to one-half what it was 
in 1870, was convincing proof. The increase in the enrollment 
in Southern schools from about one-third of the scholastic popu- 
lation in 1870 to about two-thirds in 1900, or double what it 
was in the former year was further confirmation of all the 
claims made for Southern educational progress. 
We have twice as many illiterates even among the whites as 
our population justifies, based on the number in the United 
States. Technical illiteracy is more important as a mark, a 
counter. It indicates a general condition. Of those able to 
read and write many have not received sufficient instruction to 
enable them to pursue their own self-education. The report 
of one of our Tennessee city school teachers to her Superin- 
tendent is illuminating as to conditions which are far too 
prevalent. She says: 
“During the year past has enrolled two hundred and 
forty-one pupils. Of the number remaining in school to the 
close ninety-five per cent were promoted to the higher grades. 
A large number of children, comparatively speaking, dropped 
out of the lower grades in the last two months of school. 
* * * There was a smallpox scare that caused some thirty 
children to drop out, and we could not get them back. These 
were all from the slums. In the second place, these same chil- 
dren came to school during the winter months, expecting to 
be clothed and partly fed by our Mothers’ Association. When 
the warm weather came, they no longer felt the pressing need 
of this help and dropped out of school. When we can keep 
these children in school, we are able to pass a large percent 
of them. It seems to me that there is no more important ques- 
tion to be considered, in connection with our schools, than 
one of a truant officer.” 
That is the situation among the whites of the slums in all 
our cities. It is the situation also in the mountains, and, in 
fact, in all regions of the South where the need of an education 
is not properly felt by parents.  
-P-A-G-E-69
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 69 
All this Southern stock of illiterate whites is good. The 
teacher testifies that if she can keep the child she can teach 
it. Ninety-five per cent of them are promoted. But even 
though kind people extend aid in food, clothing, books, etc., 
the children drop out of school. They sink back into the life 
of the slums. Some day those children having grown up will 
commit crimes or become dependents. At the best, they will 
never become other than ciphers in the economic progress of 
our region. They will bear children who will present to the 
next generation a problem as difficult as that confronting us. 
In all the public schools of Knoxville, the little army of 
1,560 in the first grade had dwindled down to 504 in the fifth 
and to 266 in the eighth grade. In Chattanooga for the same 
year, there were 1,926 in the first grade, 519 in the fifth, and 
276 in the eighth. These schools were under good manage- 
ment. In all the city schools of the State there were 17,130 
in the first grade, 5,181 in the fifth and 2,837 only in the eighth, 
and for all the schools of the State there were 142,704 in the 
first grade, 60,081 in the fifth, and 10,172 in the eighth. The 
number in private schools, if added, would not materially 
alter the statement. Assuming that about the same number 
started in the first grade five years before these figures were 
compiled, only about forty per cent have reached the fifth 
grade and only about seven per cent the eighth. Of course, 
some may have failed of promotion, some may have removed 
to other schools, and some died. But the broad statement may 
be confidently made that one-half our school children do not 
take the first five grades and nine-tenths do not take the first 
eight grades. 
Broadly generalizing, two-thirds of the pupils in other sec- 
tions complete the fifth grade; less than one-half in the South 
complete the fifth grade. Over one-third in other sections com- 
plete the eighth grade; less than one-sixth in the South com- 
plete the eighth grade. Negro education is not responsible for 
this. The difference in the attendance of negroes and whites 
is not at all a factor. 
‘When I state to you that compulsory education laws have 
been enacted and are in successful operation in all the States 
of the other grand divisions and for only one State and a few 
counties of the Southern States, you have an accompanying 
statement from which you may draw your own conclusions.
-P-A-G-E-70
70 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Were I to compare Southern educational conditions with 
those of Germany, the South would suffer more. In 1908 94 
per cent of all children of school age (6 to 14) were in the pub- 
lic elementary schools of Germany. Most of the other 6 per 
cent were in private schools. The increase in average attend- 
ance since 1901 has been 9.1 per cent. The percentage of illit- 
eracy is less than two-tenths of one per cent. Yet the Germans 
are not satisfied. They are endeavoring to improve their 
schools. In 1904 test examinations of 4,336 pupils in the con- 
tinuation schools were made. The object was to test the 
efficiency of the elementary schools. The following year a 
much more extended investigation was made and 16,000 ex- 
amination papers were gathered in. The Germans are devot- 
ing their most scientific thought to the development of men 
and women, to the conservation and use of all the talents of 
the child. The German is sweeping the world for ideas. Not 
only in elementary education, but in their industrial continua- 
tion schools, which are also in part compulsory, and which cor- 
respond to technical training schools, the Germans are doing 
great things. The number of pupils of these continuation 
schools increased from 201,716 in 1904 to 280,427 in 1907. 
Besides these were commercial continuation schools and rural 
continuation schools. 
If Germany, with less than two-tenths of one per cent of its 
population illiterate, requires a 215 days’ course for all pupils 
from six to fourteen years of age, how will Tennessee ever re- 
duce its illiteracy to the same degree, with a 117 days’ course 
and one-half the pupils only in school? If 242,498 were not 
enrolled in the public schools in 1895 and 270,896 were not 
enrolled in 1907, how long before all will be enrolled? Similar 
questions may be asked of other Southern States. 
If there are more illiterates, more not enrolled and more not 
in attendance now than in 1895, are we really making prog- 
ress? But no, it isn’t as bad as that. We are going ahead, 
but it is not by any means fast enough. I rejoice in what has 
been done, and yet I do not think it wise for the leaders in 
public thought, or for the press, or for those engaged in edu- 
cational work to gloss over conditions and allow our people 
to sink back contentedly wrapped in the idea that they have 
done our duty. We have not. We must arouse ourselves. We
-P-A-G-E-71
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 71 
must spend more on our schools. We must have better trained 
teachers. We must, above all, deal with the criminal parents 
who take their children out of school either for the mills or 
for idleness. It is true, of course, that we of the South are not 
as wealthy as those of other sections, and this must always be 
kept in mind in making comparisons. Tennessee’s per capita 
wealth in 1904 was only $520, as against an average of $1,314 
for the United States. In 1860 that wealth was $445 per 
capita, against $514 for the United States. Taking the per 
capita for whites alone, no doubt, the South now makes a bet- 
ter average showing than the figures given indicate. It is true 
also we have an extraordinary burden. In the sixteen former 
slave States, nearly a billion dollars has been spent on educa- 
tion in public schools since 1876, and one-third of that sum has 
been spent on colored schools. Nine-tenths of what has been 
spent on such schools has been of taxes self-imposed by the 
whites for negro education. Some day the Southern whites 
will get credit for this effort to educate the negro. That the 
training has not been altogether successful is not their fault. 
For the future they know better what lines of training are 
needed. Booker T. Washington has made his impression. In- 
dustrial for both races will be more and more provided. But 
as much as the South has spent, it must spend more. Difficult 
as are conditions, they must be overcome. The United States 
is expending $4.27 per capita of population on education. Less 
than half that amount per capita is being spent in the South. 
In 1905 the United States spent 25.5 cents on each $100.00 of 
true value of all real and personal property. The South spent 
about 20 cents. Bur THE QUESTION IS, SHOULD EXPENDITURES BE 
BASED ON PROPORTIONATE WEALTH OR ON PROPORTIONATE NEED? 
Were the South to spend twice as much per capita on the 
education of its youth as the rest of the country, it would 
probably take fifty years to overcome the difference in aver- 
age education between this section and others. If our people 
fully realized their handicap, I thoroughly believe there would 
be mass meetings at every hamlet and crossroads to demand 
that the States make the appropriations. The school teacher’s 
would become the leading profession and only the best training 
would be accepted. The crusade for education which Thomas 
Jefferson urged would be preached. A race with a deathless

record on a thousand battlefields of 1861 to 1865 would not 
flinch from any sacrifices. 
The South’s wealth is certainly sufficient for all educational 
needs. The value of property in Tennessee increased from 
$498,000,000 in 1870 to $1,400,000,000 in 1900. The increase is 
typical of all the South. 
Now, in conclusion, there are two strong arguments for at- 
tendance laws which appeal most strongly to me. 
First—The State owes every child an opportunity. The 
negligence of the parent does not excuse the State. The State 
has no more right to allow the parent to maim the child’s mind 
than it has to allow the parent to maim the child’s body. It 
is as much the State’s duty to furnish the child food for men- 
tal development as it is to furnish the child food to prevent 
physical starvation. 
Second—The State owes it to the people to protect posterity 
against the bearing down influence of the ignorant. With 
ignorance go vice, crime, dependence and lack of economic 
fitness. These not only endanger life and property, make more 
difficult the pursuit of happiness, increase taxes, but also lower 
average wealth, lessen the prosperity of all and prevent the 
progress of civilization. For the State to permit children of 
the school age to remain out of school is not only bad morals, 
but also bad business policy. 
Reason one should be sufficient. Whether or not society 
suffers or gains, we have no right to keep the door of hope 
closed to any American youth. The spirit of laws gives much 
free will to the adult, but until the youth reaches such age, the 
State must decide for him. A child so unfortunate as to have 
unnatural parents must be protected from such malign in- 
fluence. A State which blindly passes over the crimes of par- 
ent against child is unworthy of good citizenship. 
In an age when plant life and seed selection are studied as 
never before, when stock improvement has progressed to a 
high point, we overlook the child, the future man, of the image 
of God and God’s greatest creation. 
Reason two should appeal to the utilitarian. No other 
region of the civilized world has finer climate, richer soil, or 
is better endowed with coal, minerals, timber, water power, 
and all that contribute to wealth accretion than this. Some
-P-A-G-E-73

day our country must meet the competition of Europe’s most 
advanced nations. No section is better able to assume leader- 
ship than the South. 
The South calls for foreign capital. It invites immigration. 
It is now doing much to make use of nature’s riches. The in- 
vestment which will be of most value to the South is the train- 
ing of Southern youth so that they will be capable of a higher 
average of intelligence on the farm, in the mine, in the factory, 
in the counting room, and in domestic life. Nowhere in the 
world may more splendid returns be derived from a skillfully 
trained population than here. 
The South should be the modern Mesopotamia. It could 
feed and clothe all humanity. It ought to be the center of our. 
greatest industrial region, for nowhere else are fuel, labor, 
minerals, and transportation in more economical juxtaposi- 
tion. The South is investing in every kind of improved ma- 
chinery, but the most highly developed machine and the ma- 
chine which will yield the South the best dividends is the hu- 
man machine, The building of every such machine not only 
returns profit to society, but also casts off the chains of 
ignorance and sets another human being free. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
CONCRETENESS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCES. / 
WILLIAM C. RUBDIGER, THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY. 
TuureE is widespread disappointment with the result of the 
teaching of the sciences. 
The reason for this disappointment is at least two-fold. (a) 
Enthusiasts like Spencer and Huxley have led us to expect too 
much from instruction in the sciences; and (6) the instruc- 
tion that is given fails in large part because it lacks concrete- 
ness. 
A brief investigation made by the writer shows that labora- 
tory work, while usually included in high schools, is fre- 
quently of a formal nature, and that field trips, excursions, and 
outdoor work are decidedly uncommon. 
 
-P-A-G-E-74
  74 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Most of these shortcomings of science teaching in high 
schools may with justice be laid at the door of our high school 
teachers. These teachers lack training in modern educational 
theory and still hold to antiquated formal aims and methods. 
The sciences, to be taught properly, must be taught in a con- 
erete and contentful way. The student must be brought into 
direct and practical contact with biological and physical phe- 
nomena as they exist in the world about him. 
The word concrete needs to be re-defined for the teacher. 
This word is not synonymous with the concrete so much as it 
is with the familiar, the practical, and the meaningful. The 
demands of this word are not fully satisfied by laboratory 
work. It demands direct, practical, and meaningful contracts 
with the world outside the school. 
The textbook and much of the laboratory work should hold 
the same relation to science teaching that a guide book holds 
to travel. A guide book both prepares a person for what he is 
to see and interprets it to him. It supplements and largely 
takes the place of a personal guide, but it does not take the 
place of the sights of which it speaks. These must in the 
nature of the case remain the indispensable goal of travel. 
In a similar manner the phenomena and applications of 
science must remain the goal of science teaching. It is with 
these things that we must begin and it is with these that we 
must end. The textbook and the laboratory, as well as the 
teacher, have their proper places in between. It is their func- 
tion to effect the transition from natural phenomena con- 
ceived as disconnected, although interesting, to the same phe- 
nomena resolved into a scientific system and therefore still 
more interesting. 
In an ideal scheme I imagine that the teacher of physics 
would begin the subject by taking his class on a short tour of 
inspection through the city to visit shops, factories, and power 
houses in order to see the applications of mechanics, heat, 
light, and electricity. At the next meeting of the class the 
instructor might have present on the lecture table a number 
of pieces of physical apparatus that had some “go” to them and 
that he would operate before the class. The members of the 
class would, of course, not understand the principles under- 
lying all these appliances, and, therefore, the goal of the year’s
-P-A-G-E-75
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. "75. 
work would set itself, and it would be a goal full of meaning 
and promise. Who in that class would not look forward with 
keen anticipation to gaining a rational insight into the work- 
ing of all these wonderful things? 
But the preliminary trip taken with the class should only be 
an earnest of more trips to come. The study of every topic, 
whenever possible, should culminate in one or more trips of 
this kind, only the aim now should be to observe in a precise 
way how the various physical principles work and how they 
are applied. The actual steam engine should now be observed 
with care so that its operation would become clear, and the 
motor on the street car should be uncovered and the current 
traced through it from the trolley down to the rails. 
It has been my experience in teaching high school physics 
that all classes of citizens are not only willing, but pleased, 
to codéperate with the teacher in bringing the applications of 
science to the attention and comprehension of students. Doors 
usually labeled, “No Admittance,” swing open for classes 
properly guided and with a serious purpose without difficulty, 
and the foremen and engineers regard it as a privilege to be 
of assistance. A physician with X-ray and other apparatus 
is usually no less courteous in giving demonstrations, and by 
a manufacturer the visit of a class may be looked upon as an 
opportunity. Lack of codperation outside of school in science 
teaching can seldom, if ever, be pleaded by the teacher, and 
even small cities contain many places worth visiting. It is 
refreshing to see what a new and interesting place a printing 
office is to a high school class. In botany and zoology but lit- 
tle codperation is needed, for the data of these sciences are free 
for every one out of doors. 
The teaching of a science in this vital way takes time and 
effort on the part of both teacher and pupils, but the motive 
that it puts back of the work makes it possible to cover more 
rather than less ground. 
The laboratory work in a course of physics taught in this 
vital manner, it is evident, should hold a close relation to the 
work that is being done in the textbook. But this is now not 
always the case. In many places the laboratory work forms 
a course quite independent from that based on the textbook, 
being guided by its own manual and exercises. Many of these
-P-A-G-E-76
    "6 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
exercises look very much. like busy work that was invented to 
keep students occupied. They may be all right from the stand- 
point of the accomplished scientist, but for the high school 
student they are too remote from his present needs. They 
appear to him merely as tasks that have to be ground through. 
The primary function of laboratory work in high school, as 
well as in other sciences, should be to bring the work one step 
nearer the concrete than is done by the textbook. The mem- 
bers of the class should verify and apply the principles that are 
being studied in class and they should not be asked to do this 
in too precise a fashion. The quantitative aspect of science, 
while properly placed foremost in the college, should hold a 
distinctively secondary place in the high school. Here the 
qualitative aspects belong foremost. The high school student 
needs an abundance of experience with the phenomena and ap- 
plications of science, and only after he has these can he be ex- 
pected to show an interest in precise investigations and the 
mathematical framework. These things have no meaning for 
the beginner and belong to the advanced scholar and specialist. 
We have, however, been trying to begin with them, and as a 
result our students are not interested and often positively dis- 
like the work. 
Let the high school teacher therefore make his work con- 
crete; let him go to the trouble of making the phenomena and 
applications of science as these are actually going out in the 
world an integral part of his class work. Let him make these 
phenomena and applications his highest objective point, and 
let him introduce his classes directly to them. Then his work 
will not only become interesting, but in the highest degree 
educative.

CORRELATING THE WORK OF AGRICULTURAL IN- 
STRUCTION. 
DR. A. C. TRUE, DIRECTOR, U. S. OFFICE OF EXPERIMENT STATIONS, 
In large measure the correlation of instruction is bound up 
with the broad question of the correlation of all the different 
branches of our educational system. The settlement of the gen-
-P-A-G-E-77
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. aH 
eral limitations of the work of different grades of schools will 
do much to clarify and improve our educational situation. 
This is the task before our generation. As friends of agricul- 
tural education we may well devote ourselves to the part of 
this great work which belongs to us. 
The institutions in which agriculture should be taught may 
be classified as follows: (1) Elementary Schools, (2) Second- 
ary Schools, including High Schools, Academies, Agricultural 
High Schools, and Normal Schools, and (3) Colleges and Uni- 
versities. Schools of all these classes may be maintained un- 
der private or public auspices. This classification is based on 
the relative maturity of the student, as well as on his educa- 
tional attainments. 
AGRICULTURE IN BLEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
The greatest educational task now before us is to make ele- 
mentary schools in the country effective and satisfactory. To 
do this the term must be lengthened, better teachers employed, 
and as far as possible a graded system introduced. Wherever 
practicable, consolidation of districts should be made, because 
in this way a sufficient number of pupils and teachers may be 
assembled in a single school to make it a good elementary 
school. Ordinarily instruction in the elementary school should 
be based on a system of seven or eight annual grades. Study 
of the child’s natural environments should begin in the first 
grade and continue in the form of “nature study” up to the 
sixth or seventh grade—that is, until the child is about twelve 
years old. In the two highest grades the nature study should 
be directly associated with agriculture and may be called ele- 
mentary agriculture. The object here should be to awaken the 
child’s mind to the interesting facts and principles of agricul- 
ture, to show that agriculture is a progressive art, to give him 
a knowledge of the sources of new information on this art and 
how to obtain them and to inspire him with a love of country 
life and pursuits. The simple and clear teaching of a few 
things of immediately practical interest and the creation of an 
atmosphere in the school favorable to country life are the main 
things to be desired as regards agricultural instruction in the 
elementary schools.
-P-A-G-E-78
  78 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
AGRICULTURE IN HIGH SCHOOLS, 
In the public high school the aim should be to build up as 
rapidly as funds will permit, a strong four-year course suited 
to pupils from fourteen to eighteen years of age, who have 
satisfactorily completed the elementary course. For the pres- 
ent we should be reasonably satisfied if agriculture is success- 
fully taught during one or two years of that course, together 
with the elements of chemistry, physics or botany, so that the 
combined course in science and agriculture will cover at least 
five hours a week during the four years. Ultimately it is to be 
hoped that the high school course in agriculture will include 
four years of agriculture in addition to at least two years of 
natural science. In other words, that agriculture will be 
given as much time as Latin has had in the high school course. 
The aim of the high school instruction in agriculture should 
be directly practical and have special reference to the agricul- 
ture of the region in which the school is located. The prin- 
ciples on which the practice rests should be taught as far as 
the students are prepared to receive such instruction. 
One of the important functions of public high schools is the 
training of teachers for the elementary schools. In some 
States this is recognized by the formation of training classes 
for teachers. Where this is done agriculture should be required, 
and aside from this all students intending to teach in elemen- 
tary schools should be urged to take agriculture in the high 
school. It will be useful to them whether they teach in the 
country or the city. 
The high school courses in agriculture should be made strong 
enough to warrant the colleges in giving credit for agriculture 
in entrance requirements on the same basis as for courses in 
science. 
AGRICULTURE IN THE AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The special agricultural high schools should have a dis- 
tinctly vocational aim and should be especially organized to 
meet the needs of the most mature students who are not so 
situated that they can take courses in either the ordinary high 
school or the college. In other words, they are to meet the 
needs of that large body of rural youth who have left the rural
-P-A-G-E-79
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 19 
schools at an age when they do not feel comfortabe in an ordi- 
nary high school, and when it is desirable that they should go 
away from home to get a broader outlook for life, but their 
limited education prevents their entrance to college. 
These schools will naturally have students from fifteen to 
twenty-five years old. They should have a considerable faculty 
of men well-trained in agricultural science and practice and 
a special equipment of land, buildings live-stock, farm ma- 
chinery, etc., to illustrate an up-to-date agriculture for the 
regions in which they are located. Their standard course 
should be of sufficient breadth and duration to make an ade- 
quate preparation for the agricultural college, to which the 
best of their graduates should be encouraged to go. They 
should also provide shorter courses more narrowly vocational 
for those desiring immediate training for life on the farm. 
These schools should be strictly of secondary grade and 
should confine their work to this field. Their form of organiza- 
tion and the terminology attached to them should be appro- 
priate to secondary schools. They should not be colleges even 
in embryo, and should in no case give degree courses. 
AGRICULTURE IN NORMAL SCHOOLS, 
The normal schools should also be institutions of secondary 
grade and their chief business should be the training of teach- 
ers for the elementary schools. In the past American normal 
schools have been largely general high schools and until the 
high school system is fully organized they will doubtless con- 
tinue to perform that function. The aim, however, should be 
to make them training schools for teachers. In agriculture, as 
in other subjects they should carry the students up to the grade 
of high school graduates as far as the content of instruction 
is concerned, and its form include special attention to prin- 
ciples and methods of teaching. 
AGRICULTURE IN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. 
Higher education should be concentrated in the college and 
university, the latter comprising in American usage a group of 
colleges. To the college or university alone should be given 
the right to grant degrees and the State should undertake to
-P-A-G-E-80
    80 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
standarize all degrees. Admittance to college should be based 
on suitable preparation in a secondary school. Agriculture 
should be given credit in college entrance requirements. The 
college courses in agriculture should be of a grade equal to the 
courses in other subjects and degree courses in the college of 
agriculture should include groups of studies which will pro- 
vide the graduate with a liberal education. 
Instruction in agriculture should include the science of agri- 
culture and advanced practice. Graduate instruction in agri- 
culture leading to advanced degrees should be developed as 
rapidly as circumstances will permit. 
The college of agriculture should have a research depart- 
ment. Fortunately the State colleges of agriculture are pro- 
vided with this department, under the title of an agricultural 
experiment station. As far as the public maintenance of agri- 
cultural research is concerned, the whole system for the State 
should be under the direction of the College of Agriculture, in- 
cluding branch stations and coperative experiments wherever 
maintained. 
The College of Agriculture should also have an extension 
department, broadly organized, to reach adult farmers and 
their families outside the schools. For the present it seems 
best that as far as public maintenance is concerned the exten- 
sion system for the State should be under the direction of the 
college, though as the system is developed the secondary schools 
will undoubtely share in this work in increasing measure. For 
the present I believe the best interests of agricultural educa- 
tion demand that the secondary schools devote themselves 
especially to the development of satisfactory and adequate sec- 
ondary courses in agriculture for the students coming directly 
under their control. This is a great task and much remains to 
be done. The diversion of the energies of the agricultural facul- 
ties of these schools to extension and experimental work is 
likely to be most unfortunate. For example, the problem of 
managing the school farm so that it will be the right kind of 
a laboratory and demonstration farm for a secondary school is 
yet an unsolved problem of very great importance. An earnest 
attempt to solve this problem is more to be commended than 
the effort of the secondary school teacher to engage in ordinary 
extension work or in so-called experiments. If the farm of the
-P-A-G-E-81
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 81 
secondary school is rightly managed it will offer many valu- 
able object lessons to the farmers of the region and the school 
should encourage the visits of farmers to this farm and hold 
meetings for their instruction. The students should also be 
encouraged to conduct tests or improved methods and crops on 
their home farms. This is a different thing from organizing 
and conducting extension work in a wide way. As already 
stated, I believe it is best that the management of extension 
work in the State should be left to the agricultural college. 
The College of Agricultural should take part in the training 
of teachers of agriculture, and it may also aid the State De- 
partment of Education in introducing agriculture for the pub- 
lic schools. The normal work of the college or university 
should be that appropriate to a teachers’ college. That is, it 
should aim to train teachers for secondary schools and colleges. 
This may be done through regular teachers’ courses of college 
grade and through short or summer courses for teachers al- 
ready in the profession. The college should not duplicate the 
work of the normal school. 
One of the great educational problems of this country is the 
realignment of a large number of private colleges to conform 
to the new standards of education. In some cases these in- 
stitutions would do well to assume the name and functions of 
secondary schools. In other cases they can well combine sec- 
ondary work with one or two years of college work, but should 
then differentiate these two departments and should not un- 
dertake to grant degrees. The name “junior college” has been 
suggested as appropriate to institutions of this class. Aca- 
demy would be a better term. A limited number of private 
institutions should be encouraged to become true colleges or 
even universities. The smaller of these institutions would do 
well to confine their efforts to giving strong college courses 
along a limited number of lines. Thus one institution may be 
strong in mathematics and physics, another in chemistry, an- 
other in biological sciences, another in languages and litera- 
ture, another in agriculture and mechanic arts. Agriculture 
is already taught in twenty-four private colleges and this num- 
ber will undoubtedly increase. The same principles should 
govern the organization of agricultural courses in both private 
and public institutions. It will be better to have agriculture 
6

well developed in relatively few colleges. Good college instruc- 
tion in agriculture requires a considerable agricultural faculty 
and expensive equipment.

“COUNTY LIBRARIES.” 
MARY HANNAH JOHNSON. 
EVENTUALLY every county seat should have a free public 
library for the entire county. Books should be lent from the 
free library to every school in the county just as they are now 
being lent to the Nashville city schools by the Nashville Public 
Library, and the books should be free to every man and woman 
in the county. There should be a free rural delivery of books 
among country people just as there now is a rural paper de- 
livery. Imagine the advantage and resource for education and 
culture for every country man and woman, boy and girl, to be 
able to get free of charge any book suited to their needs from 
their own free library. Books on agriculture for the farmer boy, 
books on domestic science for the farmer girl, and books to 
suit every other vocation right at hand. There will be 
eventually more traveling libraries, but they will travel from 
the county seat of every county only throughout the county, 
and not such long distances as they now travel, which will be 
a saving of time, books and expense. 
Should every county maintain its own free public library 
and have it situated in the county seat with its stores of books 
available to every person in the county it would give the people 
a delight in ownership of books that nothing else could give. 
The State Library Commission would supervise and aid all of 
these libraries throughout the State, as the State Superintend- 
ent of Public Instruction supervises all schools in the State. 
A great deal must yet be done for adult education, one of the 
erying needs of to-day, and free books for the people through 
free public libraries will certainly bring more educational and 
cultural results to adults, as well as children, than any other 
agency.

DOMESTIC SCIENCE APPLIED TO HOME AND COM- 
MUNITY IMPROVEMENT. 
MRS, NEAL 8S. KNOWLES, AMES, IOWA. 
As THE world’s work becomes more complicated, the demand 
for high class boys and high class girls becomes more urgent. 
That demand has never been so absolutely imperative as it is at 
the present time. This is so noticeably true that even the care- 
less observer catches the spirit as he reads the daily paper or 
the monthly magazine. He cannot listen to a serious lecture 
or to a sermon without realizing that more and more is being 
demanded of men and women who expect to do the reat, im- 
portant work of life. 
We must remember that our boys and girls will be required 
to compete with people and conditions that differ widely from 
the people and conditions with which grandfather was required 
to compete. Consequently the argument that what was good 
enough for grandfather is good enough for us, is a weak one. 
The training of our boys and girls must be such that they 
will not suffer if compared with the best boys and girls of the 
present time. 
Toward the end of the school year when heads of departments 
are filling places for the following year, many difficult ques- 
tions arise. Not infrequently a letter of inquiry reads some- 
what like this: “I have a demand for a young man of excep- 
tional fitness. The department is new, and its success de- 
pends upon the man at the head. He must have perfect health. 
He must be well fitted so far as training is concerned and he 
must have a pleasing personality.” The college President 
reads the list of requirements, and in five cases out of ten de- 
cides that not one of his available men will meet the require- 
ments. Each one is lacking in some particular. 
How is it possible to remedy this matter and make ten men 
out of ten or ten women out of ten absolutely able to accept 
this important position and succeed in it? Boys and girls re- 
ceive their training from three sources, and these three forces 
are almost equally important. The home, the school and the 
influence of good environment are the three vital forces that 
 
-P-A-G-E-84
  84 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
determine the success or failure of the child. The child who 
has a poor home and a good school has a chance, but is sorely 
handicapped. The child who has a good home and poor school 
is still handicapped, but not so seriously. The child who is 
forced to live in the midst of unfortunate environments stands 
sorely in need of the good home and good school, in order that 
his ideals shall be kept up to the proper standard. It is this 
good standard of values that will make it more nearly pos- 
sible for him to live unharmed even though the environment is 
distinctly bad. 
It is of the home that I wish to speak first, because the home 
is most responsible for the good health of the child. There is 
no room in this busy world for unruly nerves, for headache 
and indigestion. The world demands good health, and its men 
and women cannot meet with perfect success without it. Good 
health dates away back to the first days of the infant and de- 
pends upon the mother’s knowledge of the care of this compli- 
eated organism. If it is important that the farmer shall study 
“Feeds and Feeding,” in order that his animals shall become 
more salable, is it not important that the mother shall study 
the subject for a far more important reason? If it is impor- 
tant that the farmer shall study the ventilation of his cow 
stable, in order that the cows shall thrive, give more milk and 
be less apt to become sick; is it not far more important that 
the mother shall look to the ventilation of her own home? 
There are far too many mothers who say, “I feed my baby 
whatever it wants and it does not hurt it one bit.” Must the 
poor baby die in order to prove that unwise food does not hurt 
it. I know a college graduate who fed lemon pie and pickles 
to her babe of seven months. Fortunately for the child, the 
first dose made it horribly ill, so much so that the young 
mother was frightened into making a careful study of food for 
infants. You men would not trust your steam engine in the 
hands of an unskilled operator, and yet thousands of delicate 
infants are obliged to struggle and grow as best they can in 
the hands of an inexperienced workman who knows nothing of 
the doctrine of proper food, suitable clothing, fresh air, plenty 
of sleep and good, clean surroundings. Do not be too hard in 
your judgment of him if he goes wrong because of the lack of 
all of these things.
-P-A-G-E-85
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 85 
The child who is most fortunate in his education is the child 
who really has two mothers. He has his home mother and then 
he also has his school mother. This successful school mother 
takes the child from the home and feels that her duty lies 
along the training for health and training for moral strength 
as well as training for mental strength. This school mother 
must have the knowledge of good home making ever ready and 
alert if she expects to work with the house mother in the train- 
ing of the child. 
If, as President Caroline Hazard has said, “Education is the 
correlation of learning with everyday life,” it is absolutely 
necessary that the school mother teach with the domestic 
science spirit. The teacher who is filled with this spirit is the 
teacher who prevents sickness in her school, because she teaches 
lessons concerning good ventilation, removal of dust, proper 
position of the body in standing, sitting or walking, proper 
food and proper clothing. : 
The home and school training of any body should not fit him 
to be a teacher, a farmer, a preacher or a business man, but 
should fit him to become a strong man, who is in sympathy 
with the world’s best effort and the world’s best work. He 
must be man who sees the relative importance of all lines of 
work and who sees the value of cultural as well as vocational 
training. He must see that the boy is not educated unless 
that education touches hand and heart as well as head. 
The home and school training of the girl should develop a 
strong, wholesome, sympathetic girl, who is neither teacher, 
housekeeper, bookkeeper, or society girl, but who is a woman 
through and through. She is a woman who is able to adapt 
herself to any of life’s conditions, because her training has put 
her in sympathy with work and play, wealth and poverty, 
town and country, cultural pursuits and useful labor. 
Fathers and mothers and teachers, remember as you continue 
your life work, that a life which is conducted along domestic 
science lines is the life which attempts to add to itself a little 
more of good health, good cheer, useful effort and good fellow- 
ship, day by day. What can you do to direct the lives of boys 
and girls into that broad, deep channel?

EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN NORTH CAROLINA DUR- 
ING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1910. 
SUPT. J. Y. JOYNER, RALEIGH, N. C. 
Unover the act of the General Assembly of 1907, authorizing 
the establishment of public high schools and making an ap- 
propriation of $45,000 (which was increased by the General 
Assembly of 1909 to $50,000) for this purpose, one hundred 
and seventy public high schools have been established in eighty- 
seven counties. There are now, therefore, only eleven counties 
in the State that do not have from one to four of these schools. 
The report of the State Inspector of Public High Schools 
shows that 5,775 pupils were enrolled in these schools during 
the year, 2,764 boys and 3,011 girls; and that 4,145 were in 
average daily attendance. This attendance represents 71 per 
cent of the enrollment. These schools employ 259 teachers 
doing high school work, and provide two to four-years courses 
of study, making it possible for their graduates to enter the 
colleges of the State without condition. It is our hope and 
plan soon to have central county high schools, in which 
parallel courses of study will be given in the usual academic 
branches and in agriculture and domestic science. In fact, 
some of the schools have already begun industrial work and 
have met with marked success in it. 
In connection with some of these high schools dormitories 
have been built and equipped, in which high school students 
ean secure board at actual cost and pay for it in money or in 
provisions at the market price. 
The total expenditure of $127,054.88 for the maintenance’ of 
these schools was in part as follows: Principals’ salaries, 
$109,878.52; assistant teachers’ salaries, $13,542.75. The total 
fund of $138,631.77 for these schools was raised as follows, 
leaving out of account the balance from the preceding year: 
By local taxation, $40,446.86 ; by private donation, $8,558.72 ; 
by county appropriation, $30,908.24; by State appropriation, 
$49,025.00. 
‘When we consider that the public high school system is only 
three years old, we take these evidences of growth as an ex-
-P-A-G-E-87
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 87 
pression of strong public sentiment among our rural population 
for high school education. 
LOCAL TAX DISTRICTS. 
During the year 184 local tax districts were established, 
making the total number of such districts in the State 995. 
All of the ninety-eight counties, except three, now have from 
one to forty-seven of these special tax districts. We haye 
voted upon an average almost three of these special tax dis- 
tricts per week. Twenty-three per cent of the total annual 
school fund is now raised by local taxation in these districts, 
altogether making $877,899.91. The significance of this move- 
ment is made evident by the fact that the average school term 
in the local tax districts has been increased by this special 
taxation about two months, and has, therefore, enabled com- 
mittees to employ better trained teachers, by paying better 
salaries and offering longer terms. 
NEW SCHOOLHOUSES BUILT, OLD HOUSES AND GROUNDS IMPROVED. 
Three hundred and sixty-nine new houses were built during 
the year, costing $239,160.58, still maintaining our average of 
one new schoolhouse for every day in the year, Sundays in- 
cluded. This record of building schoolhouses in accordance 
with plans of modern school architecture, provided from the 
office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, has 
been maintained for the past eight years. Many old houses 
have been remodeled and enlarged, not accounted for above, 
in many instances almost wholly by private donation. 
In this connection I must call attention to the work of the 
Woman’s Association for the Betterment of Public School- 
houses and Grounds. This association has been instrumental 
in prolonging the school term in many instances and in hay- 
ing old houses improved and made comfortable. In their work 
of improving school grounds, there is no means of estimating 
approximately the success of this organization. In Wake 
County alone last year $6,021.18 was raised by this organiza- 
tion for the betterment of the schools. In many districts the 
women secured codperative cultivation of small school farms 
in cotton and tobacco, and in that way not only raised a large

part of this fund, but, in some instances, gave a better oppor- 
tunity to the school to study practical agriculture. 
INCREASE IN VALUE OF SCHOOL PROPERTY. 
The value of the public school property of the elementary 
and secondary schools is now $5,862,969.00. This is an increase 
of $427,180.00, almost half a million dollars, over the preceding 
year. The average value of white rural schoolhouses is now 
$525.00, white urban schoolhouses $14,666.00; the average value 
of colored rural schoolhouses is $176.00, colored urban school 
houses $3,221.00. Last year $346,942.68 was spent for new 
rural schoolhouses and sites alone. 
LOAN FUND FOR BUILDING, IMPROVING AND EQUIPPING PUBLIC 
SCHOOLHOUSES, 
The growth mentioned above has been made possible in 
many instances by the loan fund. It continues to grow and 
increase in usefulness. By means of this fund incalculable 
service has been rendered in building and improving school- 
houses, making it possible oftentimes for a district to have at 
once a comfortable schoolhouse, when without the help of the 
Joan fund there might not be any sort of house in the district 
for years. The county and the district have often been induced 
to raise funds for building and improving public schoolhouses, 
to duplicate the loan from the State, when without this as- 
sistance the county and the district would not likely be encour- 
aged to raise the needed funds. There are always on hand 
a year in advance applications sufficient to take up the funds 
available for loans. The total amount of loans made during 
the year was $55,725.00, to forty-five counties, to aid one hun- 
dred and one districts. 
SPECIAL COUNTY TAXATION, 
The General Assembly of 1909 prescribed a different basis 
for the distribution of the second hundred thousand dollars to 
aid in making the minimum school term not less than four 
months. Heretofore this fund has been apportioned simply 
upon applications properly prepared and certified by the 
County Boards of Education. Now the county is required to
-P-A-G-E-89
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 89 
raise by special taxation, at a rate not to exceed five cents on 
the hundred dollars’ valuation of property and fifteen cents on 
the pool, an amount sufficient to provide one-half the deficit 
needed for a four-months’ term. Under this arrangement 
$105,969.67 was added to the school fund by this special 
county tax, and the manner of distributing this appropriation 
has been simplified and made more equitable. 
INCREASE IN SCHOOL FUNDS. 
The total school fund of the State is now $3,550,575.06, which 
is an increase of $131,472.03 over the preceding year; $2,377,- 
662.47 is the rural school fund, and $1,172,912.59 the urban 
school fund. 
BOYS’ CORN CLUBS AND INCREASED INTEREST IN AGRICULTURAL 
INSTRUCTION. 
By the aid of the agent for agricultural extension work in 
the public schools and the active codperation of the County 
Superintendents and public school teachers, boys’ corn clubs 
have been organized in sixty counties, enrolling approximately 
1,600 boys. The following extract from the report of this 
agent shows something of the success of this work: 
“Highty-five boys made over seventy-five bushels of corn per 
acre, and will win one of the Governor’s certificates. One boy 
made one hundred and forty-six bushels, at a cost of $40.20, and 
won the free trip to Washington, where he was presented with 
a certificate from the United States Department of Agriculture. 
Most of the County Superintendents have codperated heartily 
and deserve great credit for the success of the work.” 
PRACTICAL INSTRUCTION IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND HYGIENE. 
With the valuable assistance and coédperation of the State 
Beard of Health and its efficient and energetic Secretary and 
Assistant Secretaries, interest in the teaching of personal 
hygiene and public health has been increased, and more time 
is being given to this matter by public school teachers than 
ever before. From the office of the State Superintendent of 
Public Instruction bulletins have been issued, dealing in a 
concise, simple and practical way with the simple hygenic

laws affecting the everday life of the child and the people. An 
effort has been made to make the instruction apply to our own 
conditions here in North Carolina, our own children and the 
people generally, realizing that the object of chief concern to 
every boy and girl in the public schools ought to be his own 
physical welfare first of all; that of his neighbor and the public 
about him next. 
'TEACHER-TRAINING. 
Teachers’ Institutes were held last year in sixty-six counties, 
and were attended by 4,454 teachers. With the aid of an effi- 
cient supervisor of teacher-training, the work of the teachers’ 
institutes has been systematized and made more serviceable, 
teachers’ reading circles have also been organized, and a valu- 
able course of home study and home training for the profes- 
sional improvement of the rank and file of the public school 
teachers is being successfully conducted. Teachers’ associa- 
tions, held monthly, have been organized in a majority of the 
counties, and in them the course of the reading circle is made 
the basis for the programs. Reading circles have been organ- 
ized in ninety-one of the ninety-eight counties of the State. 
Under the present plan, a trained man and a trained woman 
conduct each county teachers’ institute, which must be held, 
according to the present law, once in every two years. All 
institute conductors are required to meet each year with the 
State Superintendent of Public Instruction and the supervisor 
of teacher-training, before the institute work begins, for a defi- 
nite planning and outlining of the work to be done. The plans 
and outlines are then published in bulletin form for the direc- 
tion of the institute workers. 
‘ 
RURAL LIBRARIES, 
One hundred and ninety-two new rural libraries were estab- 
lished during the year, costing approximately $5,760.00, making 
the total number of rural libraries in the State 2,420. More 
than one-third of all the rural school districts in the State now 
have libraries, containing an average of about one hundred 
volumes each of well selected books. One hundred and twelve 
supplemental libraries were also added to libraries already 
established.

EDUCATIONAL LITERATURE, 
In order to better direct the work of the public schools of the 
State, there has been issued from the office of the State Super- 
intendent of Public Instruction a large amount of literature 
that seems to have been successful in helping teachers to plan 
and execute their work, and also has helped to arouse and 
strengthen interest generally among our people. 
I should like to take this opportunity of calling attention 
to some of this literature, as follows: 
Program of North Carolina Day, Approved Books for Rural 
Libraries, Approved Plans for Public Schoolhouses, Bulletin 
on Woman’s Association for the Betterment of Public School- 
houses and Grounds, Hand Book for High School Teachers, 
Teachers’ Reading Circle, Opening Excercises in Public 
Schools, Washington’s Birthday, A Manual of Physiology and 
Hygiene in the Primary Grades, Eyes and Ears, Ground-itch 
or Hookworm Disease, Health Talks in Public Schools, Young 
People’s Farm-Life Clubs, Child Study as an Aid to Discipline, 
Educating for Farm Life, Local Taxation Leaflets, Manual for 
Teachers’ Institutes.

EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN KENTUCKY. 
SUPT. ELLSWORTH REGHNSTEIN, FRANKFORT. 
Tue year of 1910 has been one of steady growth and develop- 
ment of the public school System of Kentucky. Such an inter- 
est in education has been awakened among the people of our 
commonwealth as never before existed. In almost every county 
and city of the State new buildings are either being planned 
er are now in course of construction. In all sections of the 
State patrons, teachers, Superintendents, and Boards of Edu- 
cation are planning for longer terms and better schools, and 
there is a growing disposition on the part of the people to tax 
themselves freely for school purposes. Steps have been taken 
in every county of the State to establish high schools, and in a 
large majority of the counties high schools are already in opera- 
tion. The State Normal Schools are doing excellent work, ana

the attendance at both Richmond and Bowling Green is steadily 
increasing. Briefly, the work of the year in Kentucky has been 
entirely satisfactory, and the people are so thoroughly aroused 
to the need of better schools that we fear no lagging of the for- 
ward movement which is so well under way. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN MISSOURI IN 1910. 
HOWARD A. GASS, JEFFERSON CITY, MO. 
Tue whole school system of the State of Missouri was never 
in better working order than at the present time. A sym- 
pathetic spirit of codperation is now more apparent than ever 
before. The growth in interest and efficiency has been espe- 
cially marked. The work of the County Superintendent has 
had a very beneficial effect upon the country schools. The 
course of study revised and published by the State Superin- 
tendent has been put into general use, and has resulted in har- 
monizing and unifying the work of the schools. By using the 
course of study teachers are learning the relation of one sub- 
ject to another and also what constitutes the essentials of 
each subject. They are also learning that a number of branches 
are necessary to constitute a well balanced course of study, and 
that in order to develop and train the whole child it is neces- 
sary to study these subjects in due proportion. 
The use of this course under the intelligent direction of the 
County Superintendent has resulted in better organization, 
graduation and classification of the country schools. In a ma- 
jority of the schools each child knows in what class and to 
what grade he belongs, and just what work he must do in order 
to pass to the next higher grade, and so on to the completion 
of the course. The course of study sets forth definitely just 
what work, and how much is to be accomplished in a given 
time. The course is based upon a school term of eight months, 
subdivided into four quarters of two months each. At the end 
of each quarter each class is tested on the work of the quarter, 
using the questions prepared and sent out by the State Super- 
intendent. At the end of the year those who have completed
-P-A-G-E-93
  JOURNAL OF PROOEHEDINGS. 93 
the work of the eight grades are given a final examination, and 
if they pass satisfactorily, certificates of completion are given 
them. 
County graduation exercises are held under the direction of 
the County Superintendent after the close of the country 
schools. In most cases these are made “Educational Rally 
Days,” and many patrons and teachers attend them. In some 
counties many of the pupils take part in the exercises. At the 
close of the school last spring nearly nine thousand girls and 
boys graduated from the country schools and received high 
school entrance certificates. 
During the past year there has probably been more building, 
repairing, refurnishing, and cleaning up of schoolhouses in 
Missouri than ever before in a like period. In a large majority 
of the districts of the State “Clean-Up Day” was observed. 
The patrons of the schools met at the schoolhouses and put 
the buildings and grounds in proper condition for school. 
Nearly all of the buildings erected during the year are of 
modern type, well adapted to the needs of the schools. Much 
attention is being given to proper heating, lighting and venti- 
lating of schoolrooms and to the supplying of pure water for' 
the use of the children. 
The State Superintendent is inaugurating a system of in- 
spection and approved of country schools. He has formulated a 
set of conditions and fixed standards of excellence which, when 
reached, entitle the school to approval. This movement is re- 
sulting in improving the country schools in many particulars. 
Its effect is noticed in better physical conditions, such as pa- 
pering, painting and supplying new apparatus and library 
books. 
Other evidences of awakening interest in the country schools 
are the lengthening of the term and increasing the salary of 
the teachers. 
Not all evidences of educational growth and development 
are to be seen in the elementary schools. For a number of 
years Missouri high schools have been making substantial prog- 
ress. The past year has been no exception unless in still greater 
improvement. The statistics recently gathered from high 
schools show a larger enrollment of students and larger num- 
ber of teachers, more and better library and laboratory equip-

ment than ever before. The high school inspection reports 
show that a larger number of high school teachers have had 
special training for their work, and are growing more and 
more efficient. There is a demand for specially trained teachers 
in the high schools and a willingness to pay liberal salaries for 
efficient service. 
There has been a decided improvement toward rationalizing 
the course of study for high schools by offering students an 
opportunity for manual and vocational training. 
High school inspection for the purpose of approval has re- 
sulted in stimulating pupils and teachers to greater efforts to- 
ward raising standards. There are at this time 125 first class 
(“4 year”) high schools; forty second class (“3 year”) high 
schools; sixty-four third class (“2 year”) high schools. Nearly 
one hundred are now on the list requesting inspection. 
The work in the more advanced institutions shows as much 
growth as is evident in the other classes of schools. The nor- 
mal schools are enjoying the most prosperous growth in their 
history, and are extending the scope of their work so that it 
covers a broader field and brings the schools into relation with 
the teachers than has been possible in the past. The extension 
of the work of the normals so as to cover the subject of agricul- 
ture and to prepare teachers of that subject for the rural 
schools is a decided advance both for the normal schools and 
for the country schools. 
The State University also has made great advancement in 
the matter of bringing the work of the schools into direct con- 
tact with the people of the State. The extension courses, the 
agricultural fairs, the farmers’ institutes and the lecture tours 
of specialists have aroused a personal interest in education in 
many places where interest was entirely lacking before. The 
growth of the University has been very great and quite satis- 
factory, but the growth of its influence in the State has been 
even greater than the growth in enrollment or in the number 
of courses offered.

[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS OF YEAR. 
M. L, BRITTAIN, STATE SCHOOL COMMISSIONER OF GRORGIA, 
For three years past the teachers of Georgia have endeavored 
to secure the passage of a measure known as the “General 
Educational Bill.” While we failed at the last session of the 
Legislature we were nearer achieving success than ever before. 
This encourages us to believe that the law-making powers are 
gradually becoming more inclined to meet the wishes of the 
teachers and gives reason to hope for wise legislation on the 
subject in the near future. 
The proposed bill contemplates the enlargement of the State 
Board of Education, giving that body increased powers. It 
algo includes improvement in the matter of the certification 
and examination of teachers—both of which deserve attention 
in the Empire State of the South. 
The laws passed at the recent session of the Georgia Legisla- 
ture were five in number. The most important was an amend- 
ment to the Constitution premitting counties to levy taxes for 
high schools. Heretofore this privilege with us has been re- 
stricted chiefly to cities and towns—most of our counties hav- 
ing the right to tax themselves for instructing children in the 
elementary branches of an English education only. 
In our State it is a curious as well as a sad fact that since 
the war the door of hope has been almost closed to the country 
child in the matter of broad educational privilege throughout 
the South. The man from the rural district has been too much 
inclined to fight against taxation in every shape and form. 
While his urban brother is determined to secure educational 
facilities despite parsimonious constitutional difficulties, the 
man from the country is not generally “so dispoged,” as Mrs. 
Gamp would say. The cause dates back to reconstruction 
times and extravagance—these old ghosts of past days still 
haunting our people. As a natural consequence, many families, 
ambitious for the best opportunities for their children, are 
raoving to the cities. 
We frequently present figures showing most gratifying prog- 
ress in the various States at these meetings, but if it develops

96 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
on closer investigation that the improvement is mainly urban, 
there is just cause for a lack of satisfaction with general con- 
ditions. The drain upon the country in order to make these 
improvements in town and city may be so severe as to render 
educational improvement increasingly difficult. Right here is 
an element of danger which seems to be growing in our land 
and which deserves earnest attention on our part. 
There is reason for encouragement in the growth and prog- 
ress of educational sentiment in Georgia. But much needs to 
be done yet in the way of arousing our people to a greater en- 
thusiasm for this work. Within the next few months we expect 
to begin a campaign with this end in view. We hope to enlist 
all our people in the fight against the bondage of ignorance. 
The cause is almost sacred—more so than that which inspired 
the old Battle Hymn, 
“In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea; 
As He died to make men holy, let us die to make men free.”

REPORT ON EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS IN MARYLAND. 
: B. K. PURDUM, ASSISTANT STATH SUPERINTENDENT. 
EpucaTIonaL progress in the State of Maryland during the 
last year has been highly satisfactory. There is a constantly 
increasing interest, on the part of the people generally, in the 
public schools. This has, in some localities, amounted to al- 
most a revival. 
When 90 per cent of the taxpayers in a county that already 
pays higher salaries than any other in the State, petition the 
County Commissioners to levy a tax sufficient to increase the 
pay of all teachers 25 per cent, it looks as though the people 
believe in the public schools, and also have some faith in the 
teacher. 
This was done in one of our Maryland counties, and not at 
the instigation of the teachers themselves. The campaign was 
conducted by prominent citizens, improvement associations and 
other organizations.
-P-A-G-E-97
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 97 
Similar campaigns have been conducted in a number of coun- 
ties for that and other purposes—all indicating healthful 
school conditions. 
EDUCATIONAL CONDITIONS. 
We have not, until this year, begun to reap the benefits of 
some of the educational legislation of 1908. 
Our Legislature of that year created two educational com- 
missions—one to deal with the whole broad subject of public 
education, and the other to investigate the special subject of 
industrial education. Both did thorough and efficient work, 
collected much valuable information, and published their re- 
ports this year. The Legislature of 1910 enacted many of their 
recommendations into law. 
TEACHERS’ SALARIES. 
We are now just beginning to see the benefit of the 1908 sal- 
ary law, which left undisturbed the old minimum of $300 for 
all teachers; and fixed minimums of $350, $400 and $450, on a 
basis if experience, for teachers holding first class certificates. 
A number of counties were already paying more than these 
minimums, but it meant a substantial increase in more than 50 
per cent of the counties, and likewise an increase in their 
school levy, which was met without opposition. The effect that 
we now notice is an effort, on the part of second class teachers, 
to raise the class of their certificates ; a tendency on the part of 
experienced teachers to remain in the work, and an increase in 
the number of applications for admission to our normal schools. 
GRADE SUPERVISORS. 
Our 1910 Legislature proved to be a friendly one to the cause 
of education, since it gave the school people practically every- 
thing they sought. 
It legalized the appointment of grade supervisors to supple- 
ment the work of the County Superintendent. (I am assuming 
that you know that, in Maryland, the county is the unit of 
both supervision and administration.) It provided one Super- 
visor in the smaller counties, and more in the larger—the num- 
ber being approximately one to each 100 teachers. 
7 
 
-P-A-G-E-98
  98 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Nearly half of our counties have appointed grade super- 
visors, and it is the testimony of some of our Superintendents 
that their work has, in one year, increased the efficiency of 
their teaching force from 15 per cent to 20 per cent. 
HIGH SCHOOLS. 
The high school question is one that has perplexed us for a 
long while, but our 1910 Legislature dealt rather heroically 
with it, by repealing all existing laws and providing an entriely 
new scheme. 
High schools are divided into two classes, known as first and 
second groups. This classification is based on the number of 
pupils enrolled, number of teachers employed, number of years 
of instruction given and amount of vocational work offered. 
Manual training, household economics and agricultural or com- 
mercial courses are required. 
The State aid for second group schools is $1,400 annually, 
while that of the first group ranges from $2,300 to $2,500. 
Previous to 1910 the law did not even define a high school. 
No State aid was extended to high schools as such, though ap- 
propriations were made annually for the maintenance of man- 
ual training and commercial departments. I believe that I am 
correct in stating that the State aid provided by our new law 
is rather more generous than that extended to high schools in 
any other State. 
NORMAL SCHOOLS. 
We have two normal schools in Maryland—one in the ex- 
treme Western part of the State, and the other located in Balti- 
more City. The Baltimore school, which, when built about 
forty years ago, was one of the finest in the country, is now so 
out-of-date that it is entirely inadequate for the purpose. The 
two schools graduate less than one-third of the number required 
to meet the annual needs of the State. 
Our last Legislature appointed a commission to prepare 
plans and select a site in the country for a new plant to take 
the place of the one now located in Baltimore. It is proposed 
to erect a modern plant with accommodations for about 800 
students.

COLORED INDUSTRIAL TRAINING SCHOOL. 
We are now erecting, on a farm of about 200 acres, build- 
ings for a Colored Industrial Training School, with the hope 
that we may supply teachers that have been so trained as to 
enable them to give in the colored schools instruction that will 
help, and not harm, their race. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
EDUCATION FOR LIVING. 
MISS ANNIE FAUST, COLUMBUS, MISS. 
Epucation at present is not meeting the demands. It does 
not yield returns in citizenship. The ever-present concern of 
life is living. If education is to meet the demands of this life 
it must be, it is this life itself. 
The needs of the elementary school tally with those of life at 
this period. It should bring into requisition the child in 100 
per cent of himself, then culture and information would fall 
into place as phases of growth. 
The school must be adjusted to the child. A wide- ares 
life-loving, thinking creature cannot be developed from the 
dead foramility of the average system. A merely textbook 
horizon has not sufficient circumference to include the instincts 
and interests of the child during the elementary school period. 
The problem then is to find out how much can be given the 
child that is worth while to get, in knowledge of the world, of 
historical and social growth and in capacity to express himself 
in a variety of artistic forms. 
Actual living, actual doing must create conditions by which 
the dead tools of learning are made over into the live realities 
of living. If the child’s energies are not used up in whole- 
some activities they will surely find expression in illegitimate 
conduct. Making, modeling, weaving, painting and drawing 
are modes of expression from which mental and moral strength 
expand and to which the whole being concentrates. 
The school then is as much a place for applying as for ac- 
cumulating knowledge. Knowledge is power only to the extent

to which it can be transmuted into some form of useful service. 
Work is thought, effort, life. He who finds himself loses his 
misery because in himself he finds his work his blessing—not 
his doom. It is the privilege of the school to give to its pupils 
a life work, the highest prize a teacher can ever give a pupil. 
The thing we most need to develop in our public education 
is indivdual initiative; for the world is full of people who need’ 
to be told when to use their knowledge even though they have 
learned it by heart. 
Dr. O’Shea defines education as adjustment—the revealing 
of self to the soul and the understanding of the relationship 
between that soul and the forces of life. The duty of the school 
is to make an investigation of the local conditions and a study 
of the body in the community and fit the two in an adjusted 
curriculum. 
The province of the school is more than to know, to think, 
and to do—to be is its scope. Social efficiency must be the 
conscious end of all educational effort. 
The school is a community where the social possibilities are 
great and yet it is based on the ideal of social isolation. If 
the child’s social nature is not taken into account he will suffer 
for it himself and society to which he is ill adjusted will suf- 
fer also. 
Education has been defined as right reaction. Mere knowl- 
edge is not what we want, but rather character as expressed in 
conduct. The only kind of knowledge that will stand the test 
of later years is that which has linked itself with conduct and 
has thus appeared in that final form by which its value is 
tested and its assimilation into life rendered complete. 
The demands and possibilities of the school as set forth in 
this paper must be met largely through the subject-matter. 
Since the subject-matter must cover a field as large as the std- 
dents’ vital interests, time and energy must be saved through 
all studies standing close together in mutual support. This 
unity and interdependence of different studies comes under the 
scope of the “Unified Curriculum,” which is within itself a 
theme for discussion too comprehensive to be entered into here.

EDUCATION FOR EFFICIENCY OTHER THAN 
ECONOMIC. 
JOHN PHESTON M’CONNELL, PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AND ECONOMICS, 
EMORY AND HENRY COLLEGE, VIRGINIA. 
Att truly modern nations have definitely undertaken to offer 
a school education to all classes and sexes. The result, where 
this has been realized in any marked measure, has not been alto- 
gether satisfactory. 
Since no nation at present can dare close the schools against 
any race, class, or sex, there has arisen a demand for vocational 
education, fitting the individual to function in his community 
life. Indeed, vocational education is the logical demand of 
organized society, since the organic conception of society in- 
volves division of labor with special vocational training for one 
form of labor or social service for every individual. 
Furthermore, it is claimed that most of the energy of the 
world (95 per cent some say) is consumed in work other than 
cultural and spiritual services; the economic interests of so- 
ciety are constantly growing; national rivalries of to-day are 
no longer primarily social, religious, or political, but are pre- 
dominantly economic. 
In addition to all this a psychology is quite widely advocated 
that general discipline of the human faculties is impossible, all 
discipline is special, and the education or training of the ordi- 
nary man renders him really effective in only one line of work 
or effort. 
There is much that is sound in this demand for vocational 
education with the predominant emphasis on the economic 
results; but there is also much danger, since there is a growing 
tendency to regard economic efficiency as the chief, if not ex- 
clusive, aim of the education of most of the people, and to re- 
gard the other results of vocational education, to say nothing 
of cultural education, as negligible. 
It is often forgotten that every human being’s chief voca- 
tion is living, not functioning in society in the production of 
goods or in the pursuit of a profession, important as that is. 
 
-P-A-G-E-102
102 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Sound education of any kind is and can be only a prepara- 
tion for living. Men produce goods and pursue vocations to 
secure means to live and do not live to produce good and follow 
professions. All vocations, all production of goods, all educa- 
tion, all knowledge, all government, and all social institutions 
are of worth, not in themselves and of themselves, but are 
worthy of human effort only in the degree that they enrich 
life and promote rational and righteous living. 
All vocations must be given much in common in their educa- 
tion outside of the mere tools of learning: spelling, reading, 
and writing. This common education gives all vocations many 
appreciations and gratifications in common and counteracts 
the tendency of vocationally specialized education to bring 
about aloofness or caste. It should never be forgotten that all 
vocational education is efficient otherwise than in economic 
results. 
It is undoubtedly true that want of a vocation and vocational 
skill is a cause of crime, and that vocational efficiency pro- 
motes self-respect and economic independence with their at- 
tendant effects on the character. 
Special vocational culture eventuates in moral uprightness, 
intellectual acumen, logical power, stability, and dependability 
of character—qualities just as truly utilities as are ma- 
terial goods. 
The power of enjoyment or appreciation of nature, knowl- 
edge, or art, enriches life and gives it grace and finish and pro- 
portion. Although in modern society education, especially for 
the masses, will become more vocational, yet it is society’s duty 
to emphasize the truth that living, large living, should be the 
chief vocation of all, and that vocational education is merely 
the means to the end of self-realized lives, and that the highest 
gratifications and satisfactions of such lives are not economic, 
but subjective, immaterial, and untransferable. 
If society through invention, discovery, improved agencies of 
production, and vocational training gives ten or twelve hours 
of leisure daily to all classes of workers, which it seems will 
soon be done, it will be suicidal not to provide moral and intel- 
lectual gratifications and appreciations for these hours. These 
gratifications must be subjective in character and must enable 
men, rich or poor, rationally to use leisure and to codperate 
widely with their fellows.  
-P-A-G-E-103
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 103 
The advocates of vocational education must always keep in 
mind that it is possible for a people to be rich in economic 
goods and poor in ideas and aims and standards. Rigid and 
short-sighted vocational education or training accompanied by 
contempt for other results of education than economic might 
fill the world with Gradgrinds of Dicken’s “Hard Times” and 
Schwabs of the American Steel Corporation. None that know 
the meaning of living covet their lives. This class of men fail 
to realize that the utilities of life are not merely food, clothing, 
piled-up goods, and spectacular and sensuous material gratifica- 
tion, but also intellectual, wsthetic, and ethical appreciations 
and gratifications. 
Education in the future must be more vocational. This does 
not mean that the vocationally trained must be men of narrow 
powers or interests. The cultural and secondary effects of both 
special and general education will be more appreciated and 
emphasized in the school and in the outer world.

ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AS RELATED TO ELEC- 
TRICAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOUTH. 
HARRY P. WOOD, PROFESSOR OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING, GEORGIA 
SCHOOL OF TECHNOLOGY, ATLANTA, GA. 
Tun many applications of electrical energy cannot be intelli- 
gently carried out without the aid of the electrical engineer, 
and it is well to distinguish the work of the electrical engineer 
from that of the electrician. The electrical engineer is the 
architect; the electrician is the mechanic who constructs. The 
electricial engineer is the leader who conceives and plans the 
work. He must devise methods of harnessing and utilizing the 
electrical power. He brings about economies in operation. He 
is called upon to appraise the physical condition of electrical 
properties or to report upon proposed developments for banking 
houses. The public service commissions which are springing 
up in our different States and cities need a of the high- 
est talent as members. 
Looking at the profession in this broad sense the proper edu- 
cation for preparing men for an engineering course is not
-P-A-G-E-104

a simple problem. Vitruvius stated the case admirably when, 
in reference to the educational requirements of the Roman 
architect or engineer of ancient times, he said: “An architect 
should be ingenious and apt in the acquisition of knowledge; 
* * * he should be a good writer, a skillful draughtsman, 
versed in geometry and optics, expert at figures, acquainted with 
history, informed on the principles of natural and moral philos- 
ophy, somewhat of a musician, not ignorant of the sciences 
both of law and physics, nor of the motions, laws and relations 
to each other of the heavenly bodies.” 
We require in our technical colleges a thorough training in 
the use of English and other modern languages, in drawing and 
in mathematics. These subjects are essential as an aid to the 
proper expression of one’s own ideas or interpretations of the 
ideas of others. If, in addition’ to these three. subjects, an 
engineer has a complete knowledge of physics, embracing, as it 
does, the theory of chemistry, ‘electricity, magnetism, heat, 
light, sound, mechanical forces, the properties of materials, 
thermo-dynamics and hydraulics, he is competely equipped to 
prepare himself by further self-study for engineering work— 
provided he has the instinct for correlating his knowledge. 
The course of study for the electrical engineer is essentially 
the same in all of the colleges of this country. Our Southern 
schools are possibly not so well equipped with laboratory appli- 
ances, but our graduates rank equally with those of other sec- 
tions. We find, however, in comparing the numbers of students 
pursuing the several courses of study in the technical colleges 
a considerable variation in the different sections of the United 
States. The following table compiled from the 1909 Report of 
the United States Commissioner of Education shows the num- 
bers of students reported in the civil, electrical, and mechanical 
engineering courses for the different groups of States:

Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey and Penn- 
sylvania, with the South Atlantic Division, comprising the 
eight States of Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, 
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, and the Dis- 
trict of Columbia, that the number of electrical engineering 
students in the North Atlantic Division is one-half the number 
of civil engineering students and two-thirds the number of 
mechanical engineering students. In the South Atlantic Divi- 
sion the number of electrical students is slightly greater than 
the number of civil engineering students, and a little more than 
twice as great as the number in the mechanical courses. 
While, from these comparisons, we may trace the influence 
of environment on the choice of a college course, we must not 
deduce that we are turning out too many electrical engineers 
in the South. By comparing the South Atlantic and North 
Atlantic Divisions again, we find that in proportion to the 
population we have enrolled just one-fourth the number of 
civil engineers, one-sixth the number of mechanical engineers, 
and one-half the number of electrical engineers as do the States 
of the North Atlantic Division. 
Comparing the electrical development of the two sections, 
we find that the North Atlantic Division, with twice the popu- 
lation of the South Atlantic Division, has six times the electric 
railway developments and eight times the electric lighting devel- 
opment. The State of Massachusetts alone, with one-fourth the 
population, has one and one-half times as much electric railway 
and electric lighting business as do these nine Southern States. 
The work of the electrical engineer enables us to utilize water 
power located as much as two hunded miles away. This makes 
available over three million horsepower in the Southern Appa- 
lachian region alone, or enough to operate all of the railways 
of the United States. Each hydraulic horsepower saves as 
much as twelve tons of coal per year. We now have enough 
electrical energy coming into the city of Atlanta to save one 
hundred thousand tons of coal annually. This means an abate- 
ment of the smoke nuisance as well as a material conservation 
of our coal supply. Hydro-electric plants give us so reliable 
and satisfactory a source of power that all over the South we 
see textile mills springing up where the cotton grows. Facto- 
ries of all kinds are being equipped for electric drive, and our 
electric railways are supplied with energy from the rivers.  
-P-A-G-E-106
  106 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The electrical engineer gives us an efficient method for dis- 
tributing power, and enables us to save coal by permitting the 
substitution of large and efficient steam plants for small and 
less efficient plants. For the same power the large plant will 
consume not more than one-half as much coal as the small 
plants. It is perhaps not generally realized that even in the 
large plants we are unable to get more than ten per cent of the 
energy of the coal as available power, and that we get less than 
five per cent from many of the small steam plants. These large 
plants enable us to bring about important economies in other 
directions, such as a saving in space, in labor and in general 
cost of maintenance. 
Electric lighting is convenient and satisfactory. We use in 
Georgia twelve million kilowatt hours per year for this purpose. 
The air in our dwellings is not vitiated, and we are relieved of 
the immeasurable amount of work that would be expended in 
caring for the oil lamps. And yet it is well to learn that our 
development along this line is not so great as it might be. 
The State of California, with about two-thirds the population 
of Georgia, uses fifteen times as much electrical energy for 
lighting. 
The hydro-electric plant aids rather than retards the navi- 
gation of our rivers. The dams make deep, slack water for 
many miles where formerly there may have been dangerous and 
impassable rapids. In one notable instance on the Tennessee 
River, the United States Government shared the expense of 
dams and locks, the government securing the advantages of a 
navigable river for waterway communication, and the company 
securing the use of the water for generating power. 
The electrical engineer is also a factor in the agricultural 
development of the South. Just now a four thousand horse- 
power plant is being designed in South Carolina to utilize the 
heat of the electric furnace for preparing nitro-lime from the 
nitrogen of the air, a product which is expected to prove equal 
to Chili’s saltpetre for enriching the soil. Electric stimulation 
of plant growth is a near possibility, and it is surprising to 
note the calibre of the men who are conducting experiments 
along this line, and the results already achieved.

[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
FUNCTION OF THE NORMAL SCHOOL. 
JOHN R. KIRK, PRESIDENT STATE NORMAL SCHOOL, KIRKSVILLE, MO. 
Some normal schools stand for stolid conservatism, content 
in copying devices and processes called “methods,” willing to 
mark time drilling and “training” prospective teachers to do 
things in prescribed ways. 
Good normal schools are of many types and grades. They 
are constantly changing, constantly on the alert for new and 
changing conditions in community life. Efficient normal schools 
can never afford to become standardized. Their curricula should 
be all times subject to change. 
“Training” high school graduates one or two years in pre- 
scribed processes, and then marking the quick meal products 
as professional teachers is not very good for education. Such 
short course teachers are unduly devoted to beaten paths called 
“methods.” They are commonly mechanical and seldom inspira- 
tional. They follow specific devices. They have little ingenuity 
or creative ideality. They never seriously modify education 
anywhere. They are like the tailor’s product, made to fit. 
The immaturity of high school graduates compels the normal 
schools to rebuild in such candidates the academi¢ foundations. 
Psychology, pedagogy, school economy, general methods, special 
methods, etc., are not in good pedagogical form. They consti- 
tute poorly organized courses. Being in formative stages, they 
do not constitute good mental food. They do not adequately 
develop mental virility or power of concentration or self-expres- 
sion. 
Efficient normal schools devote about two-thirds of the stu- 
dent energy to academic subjects and one-third to pedagogic 
subjects. 
“Training” in the forms of pedagogics and supervised prac- 
tice produces only superficiality, unless intermixed with organ- 
ized academic studies. Indeed, “training” in any form is not 
the chief feature in producing teachers. “Training” is a much 
overworked term. The old masters in the profession seldom 
used it. The dog and pony show is the high water mark of
-P-A-G-E-108
108 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
“training.” Prospective teachers need something better. They 
need mental awakening, power of initiative, mental concentra- 
tion, adaptability, stimulated inquisitiveness, taste for study, 
power of cogitation and habit of reflection. Most of all, they 
need the constructive ideality which is acquired and developed 
through pursuit of organized academic studies. 
The normal school, in a new community, should cover aca- 
demic and pedagogic studies, partly of high school rank and 
partly of college rank. But entrance to normal schools, far 
and wide, approaches high school graduation. While the high 
school graduate must have his academic foundations rebuilt, 
he should not be nauseated with sickening reviews of old mat- 
ter too easily within his comprehension. It should be his priv- 
ilege to enjoy the exhilaration of attacking new matter more 
advanced and more difficult than his former studies. As a 
prospective teacher, he deserves every mental stimulus which 
can be made available, such as history, literature, and other 
studies from the college viewpoint. It is better to stir and 
stimulate the hopeful young prospective teacher with matter 
which strikes him as new and fresh and worth while. If any 
one doubts this fact, he should visit a slow-going, imitative, low- 
grade normal school, and then cross over into one which typifies 
the higher ideals. 
The conservative, pattern following normal schools are over- 
effeminized. The aggressive, constructive normal schools of col- 
lege rank retain the young men as students. Some men are 
needed as teachers. Hence, we need normal schools that develop 
men into teachers side by side with women. 
There is no sacred sphere which one institution may monop- 
olize to the exclusion of another. We live in America, not 
Europe. The normal school utilizes whatever study will con- 
tribute to the making of a good teacher for any public school. 
Normal school men urged universities to establish schools of 
education covering all phases of pedagogics, from highest to 
lowest. But some university men would restrict the normal 
schools to narrow channels and low grade work. These gentle- 
men have inadequate, ill-digested, illiberal ideas. 
Some think a high school teacher should be a fully educated 
person, such as a university graduate is supposed to be, while 
the teachers up to and including the last day before entering
-P-A-G-E-109
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 109 
the high school may be any kind of nondescripts, or at best, but 
half educated persons, such as many normal school graduates 
are. 
But conditions change. We now know that if any person with 
brief and narrow preparation can be endured as a teacher, it 
is the teacher of mathematics or Latin in a high school or col- 
lege. If any teacher needs the incisive scholarship and versa- 
tility implied by a college education, it is the teacher in the 
grades, the person who must know many subjects well and start 
many children in many subjects on good foundations. 
Teachers in the grades and in the rural schools should be as 
carefully, extensively and definitely prepared as teachers in the 
high school. But such preparation is not secured in the effem- 
inized, short course normal schools. 
The “short cut” normal school graduate, with his package of 
devices and “methods” does little for education. He looks for 
help and advice instead of assuming leadership. Last summer 
at Boston the Normal School Department of the N. E. A. voted 
unanimously in favor of a four years’ normal school course, 
based upon a four years’ high school course, as preparation for 
professional life. The high grade normal schools now require 
from three to four years above high school graduation before 
issuing a diploma. 
A dozen years ago the two years’ normal school course served 
a useful purpose, but all other schools, colleges and universities 
have lately improved very much. Normal schools should not 
be at a standstill. They should be dynamic rather than static; 
constructive, creative and energizing rather than imitative, reit- 
erative and passive. They should demand the equivalent of a 
college education for every person claiming to be a “professional 
teacher.” They should not suffer arbitrary arrest of develop- 
ment, or be marooned or compressed by stratification. Some 
would introduce a caste system into American education, and 
standardize and classify after the manner of European coun- 
tries. Any approach to caste retards and damages education. 
Classifying prospective teachers at the time of high school grad- 
uation is artificial, abnormal and unnecessary. About three 
years in the normal school are necessary before young prospect- 
ive teachers begin to know themselves and develop those qual- 
ities needed in one group for efficiency in the kindergarten, in 
 
-P-A-G-E-110
  110 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
another for efficiency in the elementary school, in another for 
efficiency in the high school. Life should not be cramped by 
artificial and premature classification. 
The city training school is of doubtful utility. It “trains” 
high school graduates in routine “methods,” and supplies filling 
for gaps in mechanized education. It makes round pegs to 
plug round holes, and square pegs to plug square holes. The 
normal school should have always a college atmosphere. Its 
libraries and laboratories should be of the best. It should bring 
the intending kindergartener, elementary teacher and high 
school teacher into contact with one another. It should give 
them opportunity to differentiate after they havecome intosome 
knowledge of themselves. But it takes several years above high 
school graduation to attain such knowledge. Differentiation 
should have regard for natural inheritance, acquired intelli- 
gence, social habits, personal taste, and those spontaneities 
which exhibit themselves towards the end of a college educa- 
tion, or its equivalent. The legitimate sphere of the normal 
school, therefore, reaches into every grade and phase of public 
school education. 
Your speaker directs a model rural school, in which observ- 
ing and practice teaching are done by students already of the 
rank of college seniors. They are men and women. They have 
skill, talent and constructive ideality. Some of them will teach 
in high schools, some in elementary schools, some in rich rural 
districts at good salaries. 
People at large are as critical in their judgment of elemen- 
tary teachers as they are in their ideas of high school teachers. 
Domination of higher institutions has produced an artificial 
condition whereby advanced scholarship is required for high 
school teachers, and poor scholarship, or none at all, for ele- 
mentary teachers. This is a glaring evil. Some day the people 
will rise up and require a “square deal” for the elementary 
school. 
From the outset the normal schools stimulated all forms of 
education. Many colleges and universities long opposed. public 
high schools, while normal schools struggled to create such 
high schools. It is inconsistent in university men that any 
of them should now seek to monopolize the preparation of high 
school teachers. University men are not yet settled in the
-P-A-G-E-111
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 111 
management of their own schools of education. They have 
changed their creed and reversed their policy within fifteen 
years. A little while ago they ridiculed the professional prepa- 
ration of teachers. They told us that “poets are born, not 
made.” They helped “sit upon” Colonel Parker for many years 
while he pleaded for manual training, art, music, home eco- 
nomics and other fundamentals in education. But Colonel 
Parker lived to see new definitions. He lived to see art, music, 
manual training, home economics and physical education rec- 
ognized as fundamentals, while the three R’s took rank as neces- 
sary conventionalities. He contributed mightily to educational 
transformations. It is the sphere of the normal school to con- 
tinue the agitations that affect all education. 
American education should not become standardized, mechan- 
ized, stratified, sterilized and Europeanized, so as to destroy 
the democracy of effort which has thus far kept us in agita- 
tions, inducing thousands to struggle for leadership, while 
greater thousands shared in the uplift. 
It is the sphere of normal schools to retain sanity in educa- 
tion. Youthful leaders in university schools of education, like 
other new converts to reform, are over-demonstrative in their 
shouting. They are collating and publishing vast quantities of 
platitudes, announcing as the fruit of their research knowledge 
which has been commonplace for years. 
Even the university professors begin to have “methods.” 
Fledgling Ph.D.’s, with fixed views and over-confidence, bring 
into the high school the modus operandi of the university, the 
“lecture,” the “quiz,” and the “exam.” Nothing is more stupefy- 
ing in the high school than the grafting on of dull university 
“methods,” represented by “lecture,” “quiz,” and “exam.” These 
novices seem unconscious of apperceiving notions or of self- 
activity or of spontaneity or of constructive imagination in 
the students. They stupefy students with predigested general- 
izations. Their “teaching” is “cramming.” But good teaching 
has no beaten paths. It blazes out constantly its own avenues 
to higher mentality and richer knowledge. Good teaching is 
a habit of quick, accurate and tenacious mentality, ready 
insight, versatility, and skill in adjustments. It keeps the 
learner in expectancy as to what may come next. 
The efficient normal school uses academic subjects to produce 
 
-P-A-G-E-112
  12 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
a habit of mental alertness, keen observation, continuous con- 
structive ideality, abundant self-activity and ready initiative. 
It is of college rank. It produces side by side professional 
teachers equipped for city and for country, for elementary 
school, for kindergarten and for high school. These teachers 
differentiate naturally and gradually, in view of natural in- 
stincts, acquired habits and developing ambitions. 
The doctrine of this paper is that the sphere of the normal 
school is to create ideals, to set up standards and to exemplify 
constructively the best attainable practices in school education, 
and there is no sphere in public education which is the exclu- 
sive domain of any one kind or class of institutions, and no 
phase of public school education into which the influence of 
the normal school should not effectively reach.

GREATER EFFICIENCY IN EDUCATION. 
ROLAND B. DANIEL, COLUMBUS, GA. 
Wuen schools were first established there were certain more 
or less definite results sought to be attained. The aims and 
purposes of the school were well defined and clear. The select, 
or the elect, were to receive training that they might serve 
themselves or the church or State or humanity in a particular 
way. The work of the schools met measurably well the ends 
sought. 
When you consider what the primative schools were for, you 
must concede that the subject-matter taught was both logical 
and wise. The course did not embrace all that might have con- 
tributed to the strength of the individual for his special work, 
but so far as it went, it was good. What better training could 
the clergy want, for instance, than the courses offered him in 
grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, music, geometry and 
astronomy, such as the monastic schools gave in the sixth 
century? 
In all of these years of human endeavor we have been con- 
stantly changing our views as to what education should mean 
to the individual and to society, but until the last twenty-five
-P-A-G-E-113
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 113 
years we have had no thought of changing the curricula to 
make it conform to our changed aims and purposes. We have 
changed the results, in our minds, without changing causes. 
If the law of cause and effect was logically worked out in our 
first schools, then we cannot now logically change the latter 
without changing the former—which, as a matter of fact, we 
have attempted to do. 
The first step, perhaps, in the change that is being wrought 
in our education was the clearer understanding of what we 
expected of the product of our public education. When we 
began to understand that a man or a woman in order to be 
useful to society must first be useful to himself; that before 
he could contribute anything to the good of others he must first 
learn to provide for his own needs; then it was that we began 
to see and to know the poverty of the education that we were 
offering to the youth of our land. The common good is often 
best subserved by making the several members of society efficient 
in some special department of the world’s work, and therefore 
self-sustaining, and in a measure independent. 
In the past we have had many notable examples who have 
demonstrated their ability to meet the requirements of the new 
definition of an educated man. But it must be admitted that 
the schools contributed only in part towards their efficiency. 
The home and general environment did the rest. But the home 
has changed. 
Social and economic conditions have transferred the work- 
shop from the home and farm to the factory; our clothes are 
woven in the mills, shoes are made by machinery, all household 
goods come to us ready for use, and our food is prepared at the 
bakery. A half century ago or less, the needs and comforts of 
the people were largely supplied at home. While the purpose of 
this home work was to satisfy needs, it did possess an educa- 
tional value that is wanting in the lives of so many children of 
this day. 
This work, of course, was undertaken in an unsystematic, 
unscientific manner, and therefore did not attain its possibil- 
ities. Disconnected though it was, the value of such trainine 
may be seen in the adaptability and mental fibre of those who 
received it, notwithstanding their meager opportunity for mas- 
tering the so-called cultural studies.

-P-A-G-E-114
  114 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
In rural districts such home training lingered longer than in 
the cities and villages, and traces of it may even be found there 
today. In this period the country boy received a training, un- 
known to his city neighbor, that gave him a stamina which has 
been in evidence in many a commercial battle. 
While we welcome the change that has taken place, its pass- 
ing has robbed the youth of a part of his heritage, and since the 
school is the complement of the home in the preparation of the 
child for life, what the home abandons the school must under- 
take. 
The movement to develop in the schools the practical activ- 
ities did not originate in any State or section, but was sponta- 
neous in almost all sections of our country. Today we find that 
State legislation for practical training has reached this extent:

Sixty per cent of all the States have provided by legislation 
for some form, or forms, of practical activities; 20 per cent of 
the States have provided for technical high schools; 37 per cent 
for manual training; 23 per cent for domestic economy; 39 
per cent for agricultural training; 23 per cent for industrial 
and trade training; 6 per cent for all the practical activities. 
Of the States providing by legislation for practical activities 
(twenty-nine), 34 per cent (ten) provide for technical high 
schools; 62 per cent for manual training; 38 per cent for train- 
ing in domestic economy ; 66 per cent for agricultural training; 
38 per cent for industrial or trade training; 10 per cent for all 
the practical activities. 
The comparative recent date of all this legislation is indica- 
tive of the rapid growth of the movement for practical and voca- 
tional training. Of the twenty-nine States legislating with 
respect to practical activities of any type, twenty-five have en- 
acted their present provisions since 1900. Of the eleven States
-P-A-G-E-115
JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 115 
providing for industrial and trade training, all have enacted 
their present provisions since 1902. 
The Chairman of the Department of Superintendence re- 
quested me at this time to discuss the work done along these 
lines in the Columbus, Ga., public schools. I accede to his 
wishes the more readily because my predecessor and his pro- 
gressive Board of Education are responsible for the industrial 
features of our schools. I am simply endeavoring to perfect a 
work so admirably begun by them. 
The exhibit of the industrial features of our schools, which 
is to be found in another part of this building, will perhaps give 
you a clearer conception of our work than any words of mine 
can convey. You will find there specimens of the work done 
in the grammar schools and the first year of the high school, 
special exhibit of the work of our Primary Industrial School, 
which is a school for children of mill operatives whose home 
environment is subnormal, and a rather comprehensive exhibit 
of the work of all departments of our Secondary Industrial 
School. 
The industrial work begins in our first grade, and continues 
through the first year of the high school. The work in the 
primary grades is the same for both sexes, but in the fourth 
the boys and girls begin to pursue different courses. Then 
courses are arranged more with a view to obtaining practical 
rather than educational results. 
The supervision of this work is in the hands of specialists 
who give personal instruction to the pupils during the last 
three years. The courses include clay modeling, raffia work, 
cardboard work, weaving, knife work in thin basswood, knife 
work in cane, bent iron, and bench work; sewing, from the most 
elementary stitches to work on machines; cooking, from the 
preparation of the simplest dishes and the study of the compo- 
sition of foods, to the preparation and serving of lunches. 
All pupils are required to take this prescribed work two 
periods per week. 
We have another school, previously referred to as the Pri- 
mary Industrial School, where one-third of the school day is 
devoted to practical work in cooking, sewing, basketry, car- 
pentry and gardening. In this home school, besides the usual 
academic work, we attempt settlement work in addition to the 
industrial features.

The work already briefly referred to is more or less of the 
standard type. 
The work of our Secondary Industrial School may elicit more 
interest. The aim of this school, as stated by my predecessor, 
who was Superintendent when the school was founded, is “to 
prepare the youth of Columbus and vicinity for intelligent and 
efficient service, and for good earning power in business life or 
in the more important industries. 
“Tt is a trade school, and more; it is an academic trade school 
of high school rank. This means that the essentials of a high 
school course are given and a trade is taught. Under the head 
of essentials are included the usual high school studies in mathe- 
matics, English, history and science. No foreign languages are 
taught. There has never been any intention of teaching young 
people a trade without good academic training. The aim of 
the school is to give that culture, intelligence and mental acu- 
men that carries the skilled mechanic on to unlimited earning 
power.” 
All are required, of course, to do the full work in the academic 
subjects. Other courses are elective. The course in mechanic 
arts includes carpentry and joinery, wood-turning and pattern- 
making, modeling, forging, machine shop work, freehand and 
mechanical drawing. 
The course in textile arts embraces designing, weaving, card- 
ing and spinning, fabric analysis, dyeing, with a special course 
in textile chemistry. 
The course in business training is especially full, including 
bookkeeping, shorthand, typewriting, spelling, penmanship, let- 
ter writing, rapid calculation, commercial arithmetic, commer- 
cial geography and commercial law, and parliamentary law. 
All girls attending this school are required to take the course 
in cooking, but the courses in millinery and dressmaking are 
elective. 
Pupils of this school give three hours daily to academic work, 
and four to the practical. This school is open ten and one-half 
months of the year, allowing only a six weeks’ vacation. In 
length of school day and year, as well as in some other respects, 
we have attempted to reproduce conditions very nearly as they 
exist in commercial enterprises. 
It is rather too early to speak of results, the school having
-P-A-G-E-117

been in operation only four years. We may say, however, that 
in this time the attendance has steadily increased until it has 
doubled, and that every graduate not now pursuing a more 
advanced course in his speciality begun with us, is earning a 
living in the same line of work that he did in school. Up to 
this time we have had no failures among our graduates—all 
have “made good.” We believe that the school is founded upon 
sound principles, and we confidently expect to realize the fond- 
est anticipation of its founders.

HOW CAN THE WORK THROUGHOUT ALL THE 
GRADES IN ALL THE SCHOOLS OF A COUNTY 
BE MOST EFFICIENTLY UNIFIED? 
G. G. JOYNES, ACCOMACK, VA. 
In 1901 this was one of the serious problems that confronted 
me. My schools were not well classified, no unity of action 
on the part of the county teaching force, no uniformity of 
grades or grading in vogue. 
The first thing was a thorough organization of the teachers. 
This was accomplished by means of a live Educational Asso- 
ciation, showing an enrollment of one hundred and thirty-one 
members out of one hundred and thirty-nine county teachers. 
To grade and unify the schools of the county I have kept in 
sympathy and touch with this Association. 
In 1903, at our annual educational meeting, I had prepared 
a course of study for rural school work since known as “The 
Joynes Uniform Graded Course of Study for Rural Schools.” 
This was submitted to the Association, put in the hands of 
committee of the strongest teachers, which reported for its use 
in all the schools in the county. It was fully discussed by the 
Association, and unanimously adopted. 
How Intropucep—The County School Board backed up this 
expression of the teachers, ordered three hundred copies of the 
Uniform Graded Course for Rural Schools printed, and a copy 
put in the hands of each teacher in this division as a guide to 
classification, grading and uniformity. This effort worked a 
revolution in our school matters in the first three years.

Under the able administration of our present State Superin- 
tent, J. D. Eggleston, Jr., the wisdom and necessity for grading 
and unification have become so apparent that a course of study 
has been prepared suitable and usable in every county in the 
State. Of the many good things the present administration of 
schools in Virginia has brought about this is by no means the 
least. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I would answer the question 
assigned to me here by saying: First, the County Superintend- 
ent must be a practical and experienced school man, not a doc- 
tor, a lawyer, a farmer, and by no means a politician. Second, 
he must be a man with ability to lay out in detail his school 
policy. Third, he must have the executive ability to adjust his 
policy through his teachers to each and every individual school 
under his care. The result is sure.

HOW TO INDUCE THE PUBLIC TO IMPROVE SCHOOL 
FACILITIES. 
MRS. CLARA E. GRAHAM, SUPERINTENDENT MISSISSIPPI COUNTY 
SCHOOLS, CHARLESTON, MO. 
In reaching the public, to create in them the desired interest 
in school affairs, I have two definite lines of approach: first, 
the direct, or personal appeal; second, the indirect appeal 
through the teacher and through the child. In developing this 
plan, I prefer to proceed in the inverse order in which I have 
stated them here, making the indirect appeal first. So we begin 
with the teacher, for at the beginning of our journey through 
this labyrinth of experiences, she is the one most vitally inter- 
ested. She has everything at stake, success, reputation, livli- 
hood; and she is anxious to receive suggestions from the Super- 
intendent, and eager for every proffered help. Then it is that 
we find the opportunity ripe for placing in her hands a com- 
plete system of records, viz.: monthly reports to parents: 
monthly reports to the Superintendent; certificates of 
award, ete. 
We enroll her for the reading circle work, interest her in 
school visitations, and in a patron’s day programme. Also
-P-A-G-E-119
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 119 
stimuiate in her a desire to win the banner which is awarded 
anually for sanitary, neat, and attractive school premises, and 
last, but not least, create in her the ambition to get her school 
on the State’s approved list. 
To begin, parents are pleased, children made happy and the 
teacher encouraged when the reports for the first month are 
made up and returned. More than half the children go home 
with reports of perfect attendance and progress made in sub- 
jects pursued, and the circle of interest in the school begins 
to grow. 
After six or eight weeks the teacher arranges with the 
teacher in the adjoining district, and they spend an afternoon 
together. The largest schoolhouse and nicest yard is the one 
chosen for the “meet.” A programme of songs and recitations, 
with perhaps a spelling or arithmetic contest, is entered into. 
This gives the children a pleasant diversion as well as a profit- 
able time, and, greater than all else, many patrons attend and 
will have a deeper sympathy in affairs educational than ever 
before. A school spirit begins to grow. 
After a few more weeks, another event, the patrons’ day and 
basket dinner is arranged for. Several schools may come to- 
gether on this occasion. A spelling bee or arithmetic match 
may be called and participated in by the visiting schools. This 
gives entertainment for the patrons who have been induced to 
lay aside their farming and other business and attend the meet- 
ing, besides stimulating a healthy rivalry among the students 
of the neighboring schools. 
These visitations and the contests have encouraged the 
teacher and have given her greater enthusiasm in trying to 
win the banner, and in meeting all the conditions necessary for 
approval. She begins devising means for cleansing and adorn- 
ing the bare, dingy walls of her school room. The windows are 
washed and shades, or neat sash curtains, protect them.  Of- 
fensive or unsightly places about the yard are improved. The 
health and comfort of the pupils is looked after, in the mat- 
ter of pure water (which is protected from dust, etc., in a tight 
water-cooler with faucet, from which the children draw their 
supply into individual drinking cups), as well as the proper 
supply of heat and fresh air. The teacher’s influence in these 
things reaches the homes of her community through the chil- 
dren, and the spirit of improvement becomes contageous.
-P-A-G-E-120
120 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
By this time we are ready to use more definitely the second 
line of approach; ready to make our appeal thorough, and for 
the most important and the most valuable asset in the whole 
community—the child. For him the father sows his fields and 
reaps his grain. For him he adds to his already vast estate 
a broader acreage, or invests his surplus in interest-bearing 
bonds. Has he not watched with interest every evidence of 
growth and development, since the day his child breathed the 
breath of life? Did he not see him creep to the border of 
baby-land, then toddle safely through its mysterious by-paths 
beset with many dangers, until he has reached in safety the 
boundary line of a new world—the school world? Will he 
cease now to be interested in his boy and the new world which 
must be his abiding place for years? Surely not. There’s a 
goal for that boy at the end of the circumference of his little 
sphere, and the father must see him safely there. So when he 
goes home with a record of perfect attendance and tasks well 
performed, the kind parent sees this first mile-post of his 
child’s long journey safely passed, and he is pleased. School 
is the subject most talked of at home, especially when the 
children are present, but always in that wholesome and safe 
way that stimulates the growth of strong character, deep 
rooted in truth, nourished with fidelity and trained to 
obedience. 
Miss Truman, the teacher, is the model of perfection, the 
rule of conduct of her pupils, the bright light that lures the 
young learners to the place of instruction, and reaches in long, 
lengthening lines of benign influence down the dusty lane or 
over the hills into the homes where fathers and mothers cate! 
the beauty of its reflection in the faces of their boys and girls. 
What wonder, then, that they become willing to assume 
their part of the burdens that they see this unselfish lady try- 
ing to bear. If the walls of her school room need paint, or 
paper, or the windows need shades, if there are dangerous mud 
holes about the water supply or unsightly patches of weeds 
or spots of bare ground about the school yard, think you she 
will be wanting in helpers to correct each and every one? 
Thus, through the teacher and through the child, the Superin- 
tendent is enabled to create an interest on the part of those
-P-A-G-E-121
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 121 
who have the power and are in a position to improve the 
school facilities. 
We have seen the patrons in more than half the districts of 
our (Mississippi) county, thoroughly alive with interest and 
assisting their school in its race for the banner which is 
awarded annually, as before stated, for sanitary, neat and at- 
tractive premises. We have seen them going still farther in 
their efforts to supply all that is needed to place their schoo! 
upon the State’s approved list. That you may know how 
faithfully some of our teachers and patrons have tried to reach 
the standard of excellence, I will enumerate for you here some 
of the things required to list the schools with the approved. 
They are as follows: 
1. The term must be at least eight months in length. 
2. The teacher must hold a certificate higher than a third 
grade county. 
3. The salary paid the teacher must be at least forty dollars 
per month. 
4. The board must have complied with the library law, 
Sec. 8186, R. S., 1909. 
5. The State course of study, or its equivalent, must be 
followed. 
6. Agriculture must be taught in the higher grades. 
7. The organization and classification of the school must 
be definite and systematic. 
8. The instruction and discipline must be satisfactory. 
9. The school buildings, grounds and outbuildings must be 
adequate, clean and sanitary. 
10. A total credit of 80 points of the possible 100 must be 
earned. 
This was a most important measure on the part of our good 
State Superintendent Gass. It has done more towards im- 
proving the rural school conditions than any other educational 
venture ever projected. 
Thus far, in our plan for arousing the people to school inter- 
ests, we have proceeded by the indirect way, for what a man 
will not do for his child he can hardly be persuaded by others 
to do. 
However, the patrons’ day, and the annual rally-day which 
 
-P-A-G-E-122
122 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
we hold in the early spring, afford opportunities for the per- 
sonal appeal which we do not let go by unimproved. We use 
this occasion to urge the improvements that the teacher has al- 
ready asked for; we do this at the opportune time when a 
good programme by the children, a good dinner and a good 
time have all contributed to put into their minds and hearts 
a good feeling. Then it is that the Superintendent’s words 
will have weight, and the people will go away from the meet 
ing resolved to do something to improve their community and 
something for the benefit of posterity. 
At our rally-day programme, where all the schools are repre- 
sented, we endeavor to show what the several schools have ac- 
complished during the year. We call on others to speak and 
attest what we have said, or mention the good things we may 
have left out. 
And so, in this prosy, common-place way we are plodding on 
to better things. We are in sympathy and confidence with our 
teachers; we have enlisted their help and very best efforts; 
and united we mean to accomplish much for our favored and 
beloved county. Our motto, “Excelsior”—higher still—will 
Jead us on until our last records are signed and filed away, 
and our great Teacher has bidden us return our final report. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
MORAL TRAINING IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
HENRY F. COPE, GENERAL SKCRETARY OF THE RELIGIOUS EDUCATION 
ASSOCIATION. 
Tue keen interest of many in the problems of moral train- 
ing in the public schools is due to the clear recognition of the 
fact that no matter how many subjects our schools may teach, 
no matter how many diplomas they may award, nor even how 
well they may fit and equip youth for earning a living and for 
making material advancement, unless they train to efficiency 
in right living they must be counted as failures. New concep- 
tions of education give firmer ground than ever for the claim 
that public education is something greater than the discipline 
of intellects and the enriching of memory; that its ultimate
-P-A-G-E-123
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 123 
aim is the whole person in full social relationships; that the 
school exists to train in the fine art of right living. 
The difficulty that confronts moral training and that ac 
counts for tradiness and indefiniteness in this work is that it 
seems to border so closely on religious matters that many fear 
to touch it. We need to conceive religious education in new 
and larger terms; to realize that it means the development of 
a life to fullness of personal possibilities. Religious education 
must mean much more than memorization of religious litera- 
ture and doctrinal formule; it must mean more than cate- 
chetics; it must mean character development under the highest 
possible impulses and ideals. 
But the schools are engaged in character development. No 
single agency in our modern life is nearly as potent for ideal 
ends, for real character determination, for religious education 
in the best and broadest sense, as are our public schools. In 
them we find working the largest body of idealists, the teachers 
who pay the price of their ideals by doing higher work for 
less pay than other professions. The stimulus of social group- 
ing in the school room and playground has marked character 
effects on the children. They learn of heroes and ideals 
through the regular class work, and they acquire the practice 
of the moral life through the discipline of school organization. 
But many feel that much more is needed; that, if we need 
formal instruction in mathematics, we need also formal in- 
struction in morals. 
There can be no doubt surely of the general statement that 
the art of right living cannot be formally taught, it must be 
caught. But that does not relieve us of the duty of teaching 
its principles and some of its rules. The art of speaking good 
English must be caught rather than taught, but the English 
grammar and discipline in English literature play their part 
in making the pupil conversant with his language. So doubt- 
less we need special provision in the curriculum of the public 
school for instruction and training in moral living. The pro- 
vision ought to be determined by the developing needs of the 
child’s life, by his enlarging world and his augmenting powers. 
We need especially today that school people shall come to- 
gether to some sort of general, working agreement as to meth-

ods and material for moral training. The Religious Education 
Association is this year giving special attention to this, calling 
a conference of leading educators to meet in February in New 
York, to study this question. Their studies will be based on 
papers previously printed presenting the reports of studies and 
investigations under way for the past years, showing actual 
conditions, significant experiments and methods and material 
now in use and available. All this will be published by this 
Association, and it is hoped by this means to make a definite 
contribution to this vexed and important problem. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
“THE MORAL TRAINING IN COLLEGE ATHLETIC 
CONTESTS.” 
ALPHA BRUMAGE, PHYSICAL DIRECTOR AND ATHLETIC COACH, NE- 
BRASKA STATE NORMAL. 
Iv has been said by one of our most influential and promi- 
nent educators: “The business of a college or university is to 
train men to think, know and do. Wisdom is knowing what 
to do, skill is in doing it; virtue is doing it. It is the duty 
of the university among other things to take hold of frag- 
ments of human possibilities and arrange them so as to fit 
them for achievement. Not abstract thought, not life-long in- 
vestigation of minute data, not separation from men of lower 
fortune, but the power to bring about results in the charac- 
ter of the American scholar of today.” It seems to me that 
if the tasks just mentioned were met in every case there would 
be made for us an ideal man, in our colleges and universities, 
and from them would go out into the world men who would 
do a great and noble good. A man who would lead his people 
to a higher plain of living and accomplishment. Shelly says, 
“Man is of soul and body formed for deeds of high resolve.” 
If this is accepted as the truth, and it must be, for man in the 
image of whom he is created cannot be aught but for a good 
and noble purpose, moving on toward the divine in all thoughts 
and deeds. Then the work of our educational institutions 
must be easily defined, with man and his high ideals and as-
-P-A-G-E-125
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 125 
perations, his determination and great ambition, the college 
has but to point the way of doing and to insist upon action in 
the right way. Then to sum up the purpose in a few words 
we have—teach the young man: the importance of doing the 
right thing. 
In the few words I have chosen and will use in the next few 
moments I want to bring to your attention and to emphasize 
what can be done toward making our college men, big and 
accomplished, through training which he can receive in one 
part of college life—that part we call “athletic contests.” I am 
not going to speak about or mention the good results either 
physically, mentally or morally of systematic work in physical 
culture. I do not have the time to discuss the great and good 
side of our educational work. I want you to see only the 
young college man in all his vigor, in his manliness, with his 
unconquerable determination, on the field of play. I want you 
to see him on the only side of college life where his identity is 
not changed. On the field of play the young man shows his 
every characteristic. His good or his bad trait, as the case 
may be, are most prominent when he is left in a situation on 
his own responsibility. He is on his own responsibility in 
a game. 
Moral training, as I am going to use it, means this: Train- 
ing that shows to the young man what is right and to develop 
within him the desire to seek and always do that thing, which 
is right to himself and to his fellowmen. When I use the 
words, moral training, I want to use it in its broadest sense. 
I do not want you to use just the old meaning, moral train- 
ing of the kind that makes good habits or bad habits, I mean 
moral training the right way to do the right thing and to show 
that ultimately success hinges on this. 
In the games there is better moral influence because a young 
man enjoys the efforts he puts forth for the accomplishment 
of a definite purpose. The elements of joy are most important 
because every good feature of character grows more rapidly 
in joyous conditions. Joy is a sunshine that gives vitality to 
good principles. If what a young man is doing, he enjoys, one 
can be certain that he is doing it in the right way. Games 
afford admirable opportunities for developing the virtue of 
self-control and self-direction. Each boy must decide for him-
-P-A-G-E-126
126 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
self when and how to act in the ever-varying circumstances of 
the game. He must not only decide, but he must execute his 
decision promptly and energetically. No other work defines 
energy of character more than this. Man should be a self- 
directing agent. Play is the best school agency for developing 
propulsive power. By playing the student and young man 
learns to bear defeat bravely, and to work harder for victory 
tomorrrow because it was not won today. Final triumph and 
success by persistent practice and patient effort fills the young 
character with the faith and hope that are so essential to 
success in the life’s struggle of later years. 
When speaking of men on an athletic field I do not want 
you to picture only the big, robust, strong, athletic man, who 
plays the football game with the strength of half a team. I do 
not want you to think of some “crack” pitcher with a large 
assortment of curves and much speed in a baseball game. 
These men with great natural ability I include and refer to, 
but I am also talking for every man who can participate in 
an athletic contest of any kind. The man with the natural 
ability for the game uses only what God has given him and 
does not get the training that the other fellow does. He ex- 
ercises only a given talent. I want you to see that which can 
be accomplished through the study the playing of the game in- 
volves. I claim every man who is able to throw a baseball is 
able to get just as much out of the game as the most gifted 
player if he will give to it the time and earnest efforts. The 
playground is the best place to develop the consciousness of 
individual power and responsibility and forming appreciative 
centers in the minds of the young men, around which may be 
gathered ideas of the highest social ideal—codperation, or the 
organic unity of the race. The man on the team learns in the 
most definite way that the more completely he develops his 
powers and the more completely he can perform his part the 
more certain his team is to win. Each member thus learns 
more surely, than in any other way he could, the lesson of in- 
dividual responsibility and the power of individual effort. He 
also learns the higher lesson of unity er codperation as the 
basis of complete success. Victory results from the combined 
efforts of thoroughly trained individuals who are working 
heartily for the accomplishment of a common purpose. Play-
-P-A-G-E-127
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 127 
ing games governed by well defined rules, trains character by 
developing a spirit of submission. Plato says: “If children 
are trained to submit to laws in their play, the love of law 
enters their souls with the music accompanying the games, 
never leaves them, and helps them in their developments.” 
With our everyday young man, it is a sad fact, but true, 
that he must constantly be shown the folly of his errors. Al- 
though great and good desires and noble aspirations crowd 
his very being and make up the good part of his life, yet in his 
weakness when he fails he demands to be shown the results of 
a wrong. Experience is a dear teacher, but the young man 
demands the means more costly. If there can be placed before 
him the awfulness of failure and the fruits of success, where 
he can see and realize both, you can then point to him best, 
the methods which brought both about. Then you can help 
him in that way to always know his exact position, and you 
place him where he will help himself to avoid failure. The 
great fault with the young man of the world today is that he 
lacks decision and courage, lacks the will power to do and act 
at the time the occasion demands. The training he needs, in- 
volves an effort to make more prominent these two forces in 
him, to make more prominent those characteristics we call 
judgment, imagination, perception, insight, self-control, con- 
fidence and will power. Not any one of these will make a man, 
but a development of all are necessary, and when all are de- 
veloped to a high degree, then we have a man for the front 
ranks—a man who will take the reins in his hands and who 
will lead those about him to a greater good. 
There is required in the college course today a certain 
amount of mathematics. When asked for what purpose, the 
reply is given, to develop the reasoning power of the mind. 
There is required a certain amount of translations in Latin 
and Greek. The reason is given to develop the constructive 
power of the mind and so on through the whole course. 
A reason is given for requiring each study. The final goal 
and great purpose is to develop an evenly balanced, active 
mind. But can we, I ask, give all that is required to make 
a man ready for life’s battle in the class room, through a 
course of study? I claim that no line of study or research 
will throw a man so completely and absolutely upon his own
-P-A-G-E-128
  128 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
strength and responsibility, which is necessary to fit him for 
life’s work, where he has to think so quickly, where he must 
have judgment, self-control, confidence, courage and decision. 
as you do when you place him in an athletic contest. I say 
we can do much to develop these characteristics in an athletic 
contest. If the young man knows the rules of the game, and 
there is developed within him the spirit of contest, he will do 
as the occasion requires and receive the good training for his 
future life. Men rise and fall, are made and decay, ofttimes 
the result of a single thought, word or action. The young man 
does not realize this great truth until he has gone into life’s 
battles and has fought for the supremacy sought for in his 
great ambition. He goes into the struggle with a determina- 
tion to do his best, but, we must confess, not often enough does 
he determine to excel. Never will he succeed unless he gets 
to the front, and never will he get to the front until he outruns 
his opponent. Doing well is not enough, he must excel. 
In athletic contests today, between two college teams, what 
is the aim of each man on the field? A useless question—to 
excel, to win, to gain a victory and the victory or defeat does 
not mean as much for the winning or losing team as it does 
for each individual on the teams. It is true that a victory 
reflects to the school represented by the winning side, and the 
results are many and good. The best results, however, is to 
the man in the game, be he winner or loser, for the game was 
won or lost by a good or bad move. Thus we can impress on 
the mind of the young man that his work may be made easier 
or ended abruptly by a single act. Just as it is necessary for 
the young man to thoroughly prepare himself for a game of 
football, he must prepare for life’s battles. The requisites in 
either case are almost identical. Just as the young man is 
coached proficiently and in excellence, with an aim to always 
excel, it is coaching him to make yet higher and more lofty 
his character that he might accomplish high and noble deeds 
more easily and more often. 
Way back in the times of the Grecian and Roman gladiators, 
when a single body of men conquered the whole world, men 
were taught to fight and it was the height of accomplishment. 
True, it was a physical combat with another, and ofttimes 
as a diversion it was with some wild animal, with which a man
-P-A-G-E-129
ee ae 
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 129 
pited his strength and cunningness against animal ferocity. 
Men had to fight in order to be recognized. In the savage 
world man was called feminine, and was never given a place of 
responsibility, if he did not possess fighting qualities. Just 
as it was necessary in the cases mentioned for man to possess 
physical fighting qualities, it is necessary that he must possess 
physical and mental fighting qualities today. Remnants of 
the physical prowess remains in some of our games today, but 
the real fight is not in the physical side of the contest, but in 
the mental side. 
The average college man is ignorant so far as the true 
merits of an athletic contest are concerned. His desire to pit 
his ability against that of another has never been developed. 
It is not entirely his fault. His preparatory school has not 
encouraged games of any sort. He does not associate moral 
training with an athletic game. He sees no connection between 
the results of a well played game and any characteristics pos- 
sessed by the men taking part. Prejudice puts true merits 
and virtues of the game out of his comprehension. He calls 
it play and fit only for the idle and indolent or those inclined 
that way. The student entering college for the first time sees 
only the play and no more. However, it is a conspicuous fact 
that within the last decade our foremost colleges and univer- 
sities, with few exceptions, are laying great stress upon ath- 
letic contests. There have been built in connection with the 
gymnasiums large and well equipped athletic fields. Fields 
with perfect gridirons for football, perfect diamonds for base- 
ball, and good ovals for track athletics and providing ample 
space in addition for all field events. A dozen institutions in 
that time have built large stadiums, enclosing a space large 
enough for every man in school to have an opportunity to take 
a part in some athletic game. 
Inter-collegiate contests are now recognized as contests in 
which not only the strength of the individual body is used, but 
a contest in which the skill of the brain’is brought into action. 
Formerly it was the epllege with the team which had the 
greater number of pounds avoirdupois that was considered to 
be the stronger in athletics, but now we are glad to say that 
through the system of coaching the weight no longer plays the 
all-important part, but the team composed of men with strong, 
9  
-P-A-G-E-130
  130 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
quick-thinking and quick-acting minds is the winner in the 
majority of the cases. 
It is because of the system of coaching now used by every 
college and university and the strict scholastic requirements. 
Each institution requires of every man who takes a part in an 
inter-collegiate contest, that the games today are games of 
skill and not brawn. The instructions the athletes are given, 
together with the fact that they must be scholars of more 
than average standing, makes the teams of strong force. A 
man is coached to use his strength only where.and in any 
manner that will accomplish most. The lighter teams in foot- 
ball no longer resort to the live bucking tactics which give the 
heavier teams an advantage, but new plays have been invented 
and worked out and a closer game is the result of a contest 
between the light and heavier teams. The coaching and the 
required scholastic standing has created more interest in the 
college contests. More men are taking part in the games and 
more enthusiasm is shown by the supporters of the athletic 
contests because the fellow-students know the contestant in 
the classroom, as a co-worker and not as an athlete only. At- 
tendance at games has increased wonderfully within the past 
decade. The public no longer desires to see a victory won by 
sheer strength and superior physical ability along certain lines, 
but is anxious to see where brain and wit figure in the result. 
where behind all the strenuousness and enthusiasm there is a 
background of hard study and earnest endeavor. The public’s 
attention is also greater when it is known that only the class- 
room man is used on the athletic field. These facts make more 
candidates for our different teams. For be he little or big, if 
he can show his ability to think and act two very necessary 
requisites are filled. Cicero said, “Man was born for two 
things—thinking and acting.” These two virtues are sought 
for now when a man is needed for any purpose in life, and 
more and more is there greater stress laid on these two qualifi- 
cations in the athletic world. 
More and more there is being developed in him through 
athletics an unselfish spirit. Where a few years ago we found 
a man on a college team for a personal reason or a personal 
benefit, we now find him trying to make the team for the 
team’s sake and for the good he can do in his college. He 
goes out day after day and gives his team and his school his
-P-A-G-E-131
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 131 
most earnest efforts. The only reward he asks or seeks is a 
compliment for his team. Such a spirit as this makes for a 
man a characteristic that means much for himself, his com- 
munity and his country. The baseball player no longer seeks 
to hit the ball safely that he might increase his batting aver- 
age, but tries to hit it in a way that will advance the runner. 
Every fair means are resorted to, in order that he may win 
a victory for his team. Hopes of personal glory and personal 
credit are thrown aside. Without a doubt one of man’s great- 
est iniquities is his everlasting selfishness. Throughout his life 
there is temptation to constantly do and obtain for himself. 
His interests is his God. Where can we find such a good trait 
as when we see the college man giving to his school, days and 
weeks of moments, that would be used for himself for other 
forms of recreation or idleness. 
Again, a man is made to work with his fellowmen in ath- 
letics today in a way that is not duplicated in any other kind 
of school work, nor has not heretofore been known. The foot- 
ball team, the baseball team, the basketball team and even the 
track team of today is not made up of individual men, but 
each man is a part of a whole. Each team is a machine and 
each man is one part which has a distinct purpose, and unless 
this is carried out and performed the whole fails. In a base- 
ball game, with the signal for a base runner to advance, the 
man at the bat must meet the pitched ball and put it to the 
ground. The additional base wins the game. And with every 
nerve and fiber of his being charged with determination to 
meet this one ball, he accomplishes his end, and thus his dis- 
tinct purpose at this time is carried out. A man is made to 
see how important it is that he should do his duty in every 
case, and from this is taught that in life his part is important 
and unless he does it in a creditable manner his influence 
tends for no good. Again, we see him in a baseball game. He 
comes to the bat with no one on a base and two out. His duty 
as he has been taught, is to meet the ball and get on a base and 
complete the circuit. With the fact starring him in the face. 
that not one in seventy-five succeeds in scoring at this time of 
the game, yet he is not discouraged and he tries just as hard 
as ever to hit the ball and sees that it is just as important. 
The one hundred-yard dash man on the track team no longer 
strives to win the event from an envied opponent, but. his  
-P-A-G-E-132
  132 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
whole desire is to gain the allowed number of points for his 
team. He is truly a co-worker just as muck as the football 
or the baseball player. The spirit of the co-worker means 
unity. Unity, we are told, is the fundamental idea for all true 
education. In the development of human power the physical, 
the intellectual and the spiritual should be cultivated sepa- 
rately. Each department of human power requires special cul- 
ture, and no one line or department should be developed for 
itself alone. The worse failure of our great system of educa 
tion today is when only one department of power is improved 
to the neglect of the other elements of complete character. It 
is well that we can find something that will make a young 
man a co-worker, for in all the great activities of life co- 
workers are the first sought and from them the man who will 
finally lead is chosen. He who has learned to follow and co- 
6perate and take discipline makes good material from which 
to select a leader. 
Some evils have crept into our college athletes of today, but 
this can be said and is true of anything with which man is 
connected. The great good the contests do certainly overcomes 
any little petty wrong which gets in here and there. In the 
games the man is always taught to meet his opponent in a 
fair and manly way, always doing his best to excel, looking for 
and taking advantage of any weakness, putting the strong 
points first, or perhaps feigning weakness. He makes it not 
only a contest of strength and brawn, but a contest where skill 
and wit win. Competition comes when a man goes out in life, 
and the beginner must know how to compete. Nowhere in the 
college training of today is a practical lesson given like those 
afforded by the athletic contest. Through the long and tedious 
hours, days and weeks of training and preparation the mind 
has rehearsed every detail of the contest, and long before the 
event is scheduled and takes place every offense is met and 
every defense is thrown out. A lesson that proficiency is neces- 
sary before preparation is complete is exercised here. This is 
truly a training excelled in no way. In all our broad land 
today the college men are leading in the important affairs, and 
the college man who has fought an opponent during the days 
of his preparation for life’s battles has gained many points 
over the man who has not taken the privilege. I am glad to 
say the greater per cent of college men who have had training
-P-A-G-E-133
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 133 
in athletic contests have made good than those who have neg- 
lected the privilege offered. 
Goethe has said: “He only fears men who does not know 
them, and he who avoids them will soon misjudge them.” If 
it is necessary for men to know each other and to know how to 
mix, let us then get them together in every possible way. As I 
stated in the beginning, a man’s true identity is shown on the 
athletic field. The man on the field playing with other men, 
and with various types of men, certainly has a chance un- 
equaled anywhere to know the other fellow. 
The educational scientists and trainers of today have dis- 
sected every known quality of the human mind in an attempt 
to find still more and new ways of instilling into it the correct 
ways and habits of living. They are seeking to remedy and 
eliminate, ultimately, every imperfection, just as they are try- 
ing to perfect the ideas, they try to correct the fault. The 
question is continually asked, what more can we do in our 
efforts to give the young man the qaulity of “making good.” 
All agree on proficiency in preparation, but is that enough? 
Will proficiency develop the characteristics I mention? Those 
of judgment, imagination, perception, insight, self-control, con- 
fidence, will power, courage, decision and unselfishness. I will 
suggest this: that we try to arrange our college course of study 
so that every young man can, in his moments of recreation, 
play an athletic game of some kind, and insist that he do it 
in the right way with the right motive. I believe it will help 
much, and we can at least agree that it is worthy of our careful 
consideration. 
We must do everything we can for the young man. It is 
the duty we owe ourselves and our God. It means endless 
work, for no two are alike. We must keep on and on with our 
efforts, for the task will never be completed. The oncoming 
generations demand attention, and we must work for them. 
We can stop for a moment only. An immortal singer has said: 
“When earth’s last picture is painted, 
And the tubes are twis and dried, 
And the brightest colors have faded, 
And the youngest critic has died, 
We shall lie down for an eeon or two, 
(And wearied, shall need it,) 
Till the Master of all good workmen 
Shall bid us to work anew.”

PICTURES AS AN AID IN ART TEACHING. 
ELLSWORTH WOODWARD, DIRECTOR SCHOOL OF ART, NEWCOMB 
COLLEGE, NEW ORLEANS, LA. 
In our endeavor to give greater efficiency to the service 
which our subject has for public education, we greatly desire 
an ally in public opinion, that ally whose enlistment means a 
sure and speedy success to every good cause and without which 
little progress is possible. 
Public favor has been slow in accepting art as a useful part 
of the common school course, even in those centers where its 
utility and cultural value are not most fully recognized. It 
is therefore not strange that on the frontiers of the advancing 
age there should still be found the same problem of public 
indifference. 
This natural barrier of misunderstanding is seen to disap- 
pear in the larger and, especially, in our manufacturing cities, 
by reason of the obvious application of art to business needs. 
But in those sections in which agriculture prevails art receives 
little consideration, since its application is personal and its 
reactions less tangible. It is under these conditions, I take it, 
that we find the chief problem of the art educator in the South. 
It is here that our greatest tact and devotion must be centered, 
for indubitably it is here, where life must remain rural for the 
most part, and where manufacture will advance but slowly, 
that art in its capacity for individual resource is most needed. 
How, then, can public approval and support for the teacher 
be secured where little knowledge of the subject exists, and 
that little rather to its prejudice than otherwise? 
This question is asked by far-sighted people all through our 
Southern States. The perception of our sad deficiency in 
aesthetic cultivation is urging to action in the face of indif- 
ference and opposition. Through art is seen a path widening 
towards a richer life for the individual, and in it a power to 
transmute a raw community from a condition of sordid ugli- 
ness to one of beauty. And so art has been brought into the 
schools, but the result does not always seem to justify the 
hopes. The returns appear insignificant and the cost consid-

erable. Were it not for the fear of seeming behind the times, 
the subject would, in some instances, be withdrawn, so adverse 
seem the conditions, so slight the popular desire. We must find 
fresh courage and extended resources. 
The overshadowing difficulty in the way of the teacher’s suc- 
cess comes from the home. The practical minded parent wishes 
his children, especially his boy, to be excused from a study 
which appears to have no bearing on life as he sees it. Sma! 
wonder if the child acquires a similar viewpoint. 
Again, the mistake is too often made of laying this heavy 
burden of responsibility on young and inexperienced teachers 
p ssing slight knowledge of the wider application of the 
subject, and unable to explain convincingly the faith that is 
in them. 
The thing of prime significance in all subjects is, of course, 
the teacher, and the time will surely come when the Common- 
wealth will realize the unwisdom of handing its children over 
to ill-paid and, in consequence, poorly prepared teachers. In 
the meantime, public sentiment and the truant law help the 
academic subjects. We must find a way by which art will 
enjoy a similar support. 
My insistent thought in this connection is, that leaders of 
thought and the social order in each center of community life 
should make concerted effort to secure exhibits of pictures and 
all available art objects, and vitalize them with popular and 
sympathetic talk, not so much lectures as personal exegesis. 
Do we sufficiently realize that pictures, like books, bear a 
message for good or evil, and, like books, need commentators? 
Do we sufficiently realize what a tremendous place in human 
civilization art holds, and, if so, how little we are doing to 
make those in our charge sharers of this knowledge? 
Contrast the rapture of thanksgiving which the cultivated 
feel as they stand upon the threshold of a great art gallery, 
with the starved intellectual life of rural communities, and our 
generous impulses are stirred to immediate action. Let us, at 
least, begin the work. In this way we will learn to do better. 
An exhibition once held makes the next one easier, the choice 
of material better, and the attendance larger and more inter- 
ested. There must be a teacher of widest sympathies in attend- 
ance at known hours to interpret and vitalize. You know how

the teacher (Docent, he is called) has quite recently been made 
an indispensable member of the great museums of Boston and 
New York, and how hundreds follow these teachers with inter- 
est and profit where formerly the visitors were more of the 
nature of dazed wonderers. 
I know many women’s clubs—all honor to them—which have 
entered the field. Pictures and lecturers have been secured and 
interest pointed towards permanent organization. 
The county fair is another agent in this work which should 
be more considered and its educational aspect enlarged. Its 
wide hospitality to all forms of art, and, perhaps, much that 
is not art, is a strong incentive to the aesthetic impulses of 
the community, and in the large view, highly educational. Un- 
der liberal and wise management, such an institution may grow 
year by year into a school of influence and high standards. I 
have seen this happen in one instance, at least. 
I wonder if the unostentatious devotion to a self-imposed 
duty shown by some of our little art associations will ever be 
properly chronicled? Some of us have shared in the work of 
these organizations and know what goes to the making of a 
tolerable exhibition of paintings. The task of organization, 
raising of money, the difficulties which must be overcome in 
the securing of pictures of distinction, the room to be hired 
and prepared, the unpacking and hanging, the responsible man- 
agement of the exhibit, the repacking—all of this and more 
for a two weeks’ view of a group of paintings. Is it worth it? 
Yes, and many times over. For one day the idea fructifies in 
the public mind and a permanent museum is founded. Until 
this comes to pass in all cities of reasonable size, public educa- 
tion is without symmetry. Until art is, at least, as well and 
as universally taught as other forms of mental and spiritual 
training, not only will we not realize the full economic devel- 
opment of the State, but, what is of greater importance, the 
individual is deprived of his right in the inheritance of the 
world’s store of good. 
To emphasize this point, let me remind you, who have lived 
in cities or communities highly vitalized in all intellectual 
activities, of the wealth of beauty in architecture, in beautiful 
parks and streets, public monuments and hospitable public 
storehouses of learning and beauty, let me remind you, I say,
-P-A-G-E-137
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 137 
of what this means to you, and then contrast these advantages 
with the stagnant life of the rural village, with its sordid 
unthrift and ugliness. The thought is enough to set us ponder- 
ing ways and means for betterment. The great railroads, by 
offering prizes to their station agents for the best kept station 
yard and most attractive flower beds, have set an example 
worthy of imitation. Could not the teacher of art, by prizes, 
with aid and advice from a few interested people and the local 
paper, secure competition and friendly rivalry in developing 
the most beautiful home yard? Could not clubs be organized 
among those who live on one street to contend with a similar 
club on another street for the best kept street? 
If the rivalry were made a matter of public interest it would 
not be long before pubic pride would also be enlisted. The art 
teacher would straightway become a person of influence, and 
her subject possess practical application which would help in 
securing the support of public approval we so much desire. 
Public approval always goes out to those who accomplish 
things. 
Faith and works should go together, for we are always seek- 
ing a sign. If, accordingly, we are teaching the righteousness 
of beauty it should work out in a way to be seen and judged. 
Unless we can show results, our work will not be influential, 
and while all that we can say of the power of art to adorn and 
humanize our civilization would be far short of the truth, still 
the difficulty remains of finding the elementary way by which 
this truth may be wisely known and felt. 
For my part, I have faith to believe that one of our most 
convincing agents is the use of pictures, both in the class room 
and in public lectures. Nothing is more certain than the uni- 
versal love of pictured thought, and if our use of it is guided 
by a realization of the differing grades of development and 
intelligence among those to whom our teaching is directed, we 
may expect to see the same growth towards understanding that 
follows upon the teaching of other subjects the validity of 
which is taken for granted. 
We need not expect miracles. Progress is always slow. We 
need merely to be well assured that we are using the full meas- 
ure of our means with sympathy and patience. 
The picture is usually left to what is called its “silent influ-
-P-A-G-E-138

ence,” while we spend unstinted pains to illuminate the writ- 
ten word. It is a curious inadvertence to suppose that the 
toil and thought of great, artists who have spent their lives in 
the specialized pursuit of graphic expression should be so obvi- 
ous to untrained observers as to need no study or assistance 
from teachers. 
The contrary is as true of pictured thought as it is written 
thought, and should receive the same consideration. We will, 
otherwise, leave uncovered as pregnant though not as wide a 
page of human record as that which we have inherited through 
the book. 
You doubt this? Go back in imagination through the ages 
and observe the records which art has preserved, where all else 
has crumbled and disappeared. Remember the now trite lines 
which we often quote, but seldom reflect: 
“All passes, 
Art alone remains to us; 
The bust outlives the throne, 
The coin, Tiberius.”

POSSIBILITIES OF DOMESTIC SCIENCE IN THE 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. 
MISS CARRIE BELLE HYDE, SUPERVISOR OF PRACTICH HOME, WIN-. 
THROP COLLEGE, ROCK HILL, S. C. 
Tue strongest tendency in education today is toward the 
practical. With this tendency domestic science, or, as I prefer 
to call it, home science, is in perfect harmony. The course as 
I hope to see given will be not merely a course in cookery or 
sewing, but will embrace all the practical things of everyday 
life that affect the individual, the home or the community, will 
stir up thoughtful interest and seek better ways of doing these 
things, will improve sanitation and help stamp out disease, will 
wonderfully enrich the present course of study and make the 
school room a brighter, more attractive, more interesting place 
—will convert it truly into a “school room”—will reach out 
and help the homes and the community at large, and will, in 
return, secure the interest and hearty codperation of the whole
-P-A-G-E-139
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 139 
community. Thus the school may become a real vital agent in 
making life more attractive and more wholesome, and may help 
generally in the betterment and uplift of mankind. 
We often hear such a complaint as this from a mother: 
“When the children were small they were always worrying me 
wanting to do things, to wash dishes, sweep floors, make beds, 
and the like; now that they are large enough to help it is more 
trouble to get them to do it than it is to go on and do it your- 
self.” Who is to blame for this “driving away from home” 
process? Surely not the innocent children who tried to do 
their part, but the mothers who begin it, and the teachers who 
complete the course. If the mother would train the little 
hands and encourage the spirit of helpfulness while interest 
is at its height, and if the teacher would follow a rational 
course in the school room, beginning with interests that already 
exist—that is, making the home and the home industries the 
pivotal point rather than seeking to create new interests as yet 
remote from the child, there would be no longer this abusing 
accusation against innocent child nature. Let girls and boys, 
too, have all the learning and all the accomplishments they may 
be able to acquire, for all will be demanded in the home, but 
let them understand that the ability to plan, prepare and serve 
a wholesome, palatable, well-balanced meal, and estimate its 
cost, is of infinitely more value to themselves and to the world 
at large, than the ability to compute the square on the hypote- 
nuse of a right triangle, or to decipher the hieroglyphics of a 
Rosetta stone, and be minus the ability to serve the meal. We 
need to reconstruct the school course of study, beginning with 
the home as the pivotal point, and having all branches derive 
their raison detre from relation to the home. 
Let us look at the matter from the concrete side and see 
what is practical to be done, even in the little one-room country 
schoolhouse. 
First of all, the school room should be made into a neat, 
attractive home, and the children, with the aid and direction 
of the teacher, should do it. They will love the home they 
make. The best way of doing every form of housework may 
daily be taught and practiced here. There will be ample oppor- 
tunity for sweeping and dusting. If commercial “dust-down” 
cannot be used all the time, the use of moist tea leaves or damp  
-P-A-G-E-140
  140 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
shredded paper may be taught. If a “dustless duster” cannot 
be used all the time, squares of cheesecloth slightly damp, or 
with a few drops of oil, may be easily had. These dust cloths, 
unlike the old feather dusters, will settle and remove the dust, 
and stir up something else, for instance, sewing for the little 
folks, laundry for others, the preparation and culture of dust 
gardens for others, and for all a wealth of valuable informa- 
tion on the danger of dust. This, in its turn, may stir up excel- 
lent material for oral and written language work. But this 
simple “stirring up” process of the dust cloth will not stop in 
the school room. It will go into the homes, and stir up the 
whole community more or less. It will prevent many an ill- 
ness, and save many a life. The doctors, however, will not 
object, for they, too, are preaching prevention rather than cure 
of disease. 
The inexpensive tinting of the walls, the simple draperies at 
the windows, the few good pictures on the walls, the simple, 
dainty centerpieces on the little tables, more sewing for the 
girls and manual training for the boys, the vases with cut 
flowers, the pot plants, the window gardens, the outside flower 
garden, the little vegetable garden, the little strip of lawn with 
its clumps of shrubbery, all these will furnish a wealth of 
material for the wide-awake, enthusiastic teacher, while the 
general harmony of the whole will make everything easier, re- 
duce necessity for discipline to a minimum, and invest school 
life with an inexpressible interest and charm. 
To give some of the most valuable lessons in cookery expen- 
sive equipment is entirely unnecessary. A few inexpensive 
dishes and utensils, with some means of applying heat, are all 
that is absolutely necessary. If the teacher has a chafing dish 
she may turn it to good account. A one-burner oil stove, 
or an alcohol gas stove, or a fifty-cent alcohol lamp will serve 
her purpose. The few really necessary utensils will cost very 
little. A cast-off goods box with pillows of hay or excelsior 
or shredded paper will make a most interesting and valuable 
addition in the way of a fireless cooker. Usually the children 
can easily furnish the food material for the lesson, which need 
not occur oftener than once or twice a week. At first the 
teacher can do all the work herself before the children, explain- 
ing the best methods of doing things, giving reasons for certain
-P-A-G-E-141
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 141 
combinations, telling the story of the food material used, intro- 
ducing other people and other countries, and explaining the 
‘uses different kinds of food serve in the body. If each child can 
have an inexpensive napkin, plate, cup, saucer, knife, fork and 
spoon there may be invaluable lessons given in laying and serv- 
ing the table and in table manners. If there is no large table 
the children may use their desks, each child properly laying 
his plate. Such cooking lessons may assist in solving the puz- 
aling problem of school lunches. The napkins, dish cloths and 
towels will furish more sewing, while cupboards for the dishes 
will supply good manual training for the boys. Perhaps the 
lesson may be merely illustrative of work the children may do 
individually at home and bring up to be judged later. A gen- 
eral exhibit of this kind might occasionally take the place of 
the Friday afternoon orations and declamations. It would 
prove interesting to the community, and some public spirited 
citizen might easily be induced to encourage home industries, 
economy and better living for the masses by offering a premium 
for the best biscuits, bread, muffins, pies, cake, preserves, jellies, 
pickles, canned fruits and vegetables. Sometimes the pupils 
might be allowed to give the cooking lessons as a reward of 
merit, or some might serve as hostesses and entertain the others 
as their guests. 
The actual work of these cooking lessons need not consume 
any great amount of time if the teacher has any degree of 
skill, and if she hasn’t it she can acquire it if she wants to, and 
wants to hard enough. 
Now for the immediate uses in correlating with the regular 
school work. It is a valuable thing to be able to tell accurately 
what one sees or does. Here is a good chance for oral and 
written language work. Further opportunity will be found 
for language in the stories of the food products, the countries 
where they grow, and the people who produce them. Here, too, 
is an excellent opportunity for a geography lesson with a real 
reason for being, and interest behind it to make it a success. 
There is no more reason for taking a geography book and going 
straight than it, than there is in thus using a dictionary or 
encyclopedia. While studying the country the map may be 
made and finished in charcoal, crayon or water colors. The 
food produced may furnish material for drawing or color work.
-P-A-G-E-142
142 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
The way the body assimilates the food, and the uses of the 
different foods to the body, will furnish the physiology lesson. 
axceedingly practical and useful number work and spelling 
will always be ready. 
At all times, and under all circumstances, the teacher should 
stress economy. Her cooking lessons should give a prominent 
place to the economic use of left-overs. 
A study of the household pests, flies and mosquitoes, and of 
sanitary measures for the school and home, may be correlated 
in the same way, and will prove of untold value in raising the 
standard of cleanliness and lessening disease. 
It is coming to be recognized that no “school home” can be 
in any degree complete without its “school garden.” This can 
be made vitally interesting and helpful to the community. A 
colony of bees on the school grounds would prove of great 
interest. A poultry club would arouse interest, and might 
start some young hopeful in a valuable industry as yet far from 
being developed. 
The possibilities of a true home science will be found limit- 
less by the alert, enthusiastic teacher.

PREPARING TEACHERS TO GIVE INSTRUCTION IN 
AGRICULTURE. / 
J. F. DUGGAR, PROFESSOR OF AGRICULTURE IN ALABAMA POLY- 
TECHNIC INSTITUTE, AUBURN. 
Tun agencies at work in training teachers to give instruction 
in the subject of agriculture may be classified as follows: 
1. Agricultural colleges, whether separate or connected with 
universities; normal schools and agricultural high schools. 
2. High schools, not agricultural, but giving some instruction 
in this subject. 
3. Summer schools, summer normals. 
4, Teachers’ institutes of not more than two weeks duration, 
and all forms of fragmentary and unsystematic instruction in 
agriculture. 
5. Self-instruction by teachers working unaided.

WHAT THE TEACHER OF AGRICULTURE NEEDS. 
In fitting the teacher to give instruction in agriculture there 
must be imparted to him or to her three distinct elements of 
success. These are: 
1. Inspiration and a reasonable confidence in the importance 
of the end to be attained. 
2. Abundant subject-matter—that is, a mastery of agricul- 
tural principles, to which every addition of knowledge about 
agricultural practices will be advantageous. 
3. Some slight instructions regarding methods of teaching 
agriculture. 
How may this inspiration be imparted! Here the spoken 
word is far more effective than the printed page, but even the 
latter may be the means of awakening some degree of enthu- 
siasm. The hopeful thing in regard to imparting this first 
essential for the teacher’s progress is the fact that even a sin- 
gle address may convey just the needed word of cheer, the 
assurance of the worthiness of the end in view, and even some 
brief but fruitful suggestions on matter and methods. 
THE SUBJECT-MATTER. 
What degree of preparation for the teaching of agriculture 
may school boards and principals and parents expect? The 
answer varies with each case, but in general it may be said that 
the standard of preparation will be higher and higher each 
year, and it will advance more rapidly if progressive boards 
and superintendents reward with increased salaries those teach- 
ers who make special sacrifices to attain an exceptional degree 
of mastery over this subject. The graduates of agricultural 
courses in colleges and universities who enter teaching are to 
be found chiefly as the occupants of chairs in the colleges or 
normal schools, or. as specialists in the agricultural schools. 
College graduates in this line are chiefly teachers of teachers. 
Most of the graduates of agricultural schools who are person- 
ally and intellectually fit for the teachers’ office, and most of 
the graduates of those normal schools that have instituted 
courses in agriculture under an agricultural specialist, have 
had ample training to make them highly successful teachers 
of agriculture, either in high schools or in common schools.
-P-A-G-E-144
  144 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
But beyond all these is the great body of teachers who have 
had no such systematic instruction in the subject. They must 
look to the courses in agriculture in summer schools and to 
systematic instruction at teachers’ institutes. 
The subject-matter of agriculture is so intimately connected 
with some of the natural sciences that the teacher of agricul- 
ture who would be well equipped should also pursue at least 
brief courses in some of these natural sciences. Among these 
I should rank botany as of first importance as an aid in the 
effective teaching of agriculture. And by this I do not mean, 
necessarily, a thorough nor very deep preparation in botany. 
The more of botany the better, whatever be the kind of botany. 
But since time does not permit the average public school 
teacher to master the greater part of that wide subject, I would 
plead that the elementary courses in botany offered to teachers 
of the grades be entirely different from the first courses offered 
to men preparing for high school teaching and for investiga- 
tion and for the professions. As I see the matter, the teacher 
of elementary agriculture needs, first and foremost, to learn 
something of nature in her outward forms, to cultivate some 
habits of observation, and to devote attention to that great 
laboratory of nature where the equipment is the varied forms 
of leaf and flower and bud and fruit, and where no microscope 
is needed to awaken appreciation. In other words, I think 
that the teacher of agriculture who may have but little time 
to give to preparation in botany, needs to have the botanical 
instruction largely from the nature study standpoint. 
As second in importance to botany as a foundation for agri- 
cultural teaching, I would place chemistry. 
METHODS. 
While methods of teaching any subject are important, and 
while they are perhaps doubly important in the case of a 
subject so wide and so new as agriculture, yet I would assign 
methods to a position entirely secondary to the subject-matter 
of agriculture. We must know something before we can attain 
the fine art of imparting our knowledge effectively. However, 
lest I be misunderstood, I pause here to suggest a few princi- 
ples governing the methods of teaching agriculture to pupils: 
1. First, lead the pupil to use the eye more than the memory. 
 
-P-A-G-E-145
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 145 
2. Encourage the pupil to seek for causes, even when the 
causes cannot at that time be found. Prompt and honor the 
question, why? 
3. Third, hinge all new principles and new facts to related 
ideas that are already familiar. 
4, Fourth, whenever a principle is enunciated, encourage the 
pupils to find examples and applications of it in their own 
observation and experience. 
5. Fifth, secure the parents’ interests and help regarding the 
subject-matter of agriculture. 
6. Sixth, avoid dogmatic statements and narrow conclusions, 
remembering that agriculture is not mathematics, and that 
there may be more than one answer to most of its problems. 
NEXT STEPS. 
In conclusion, my recommendations as to the lines in which 
progress can best be made in preparing teachers to give instruc- 
tion in agriculture are the following: 
1. More universal inclusion in the curriculum of normal 
schools of agricultural instruction, given by a specialist. 
2. Daily instruction and demonstrations in agriculture in 
teachers’ institutes. 
3. Extension work in agriculture by universities and colleges 
for the special benefit of teachers, including special institutes 
or itinerant schools of agriculture, and correspondence courses 
for teachers of agriculture. 
4. The gradual introduction, first, by the mere progressive 
and wealthier counties, of the system of employing supervisors 
of agricultural instruction. It is this last step which I wish 
especially to emphasize. For I believe that the employment 
of county or city supervisors of agriculture to aid and instruct 
teachers in this subject would be the most effective step that 
could be made towards preparing the average teacher for giv- 
ing effective instruction in agriculture and towards making 
the schools perform one of their real functions in the life of 
the community. 
Such a supervisor of agriculture should work under the 
County Superintendent of Education. He could assist the Su- 
perintendent, not only in agriculture, but also in all of the sci- 
ences taught in the schools.

Must we wait for some philanthropist to make this possible 
by putting-a few such supervisors in the field and demonstrat- 
ing the educational and material results of their work? Or 
will not the more progressive counties themselves set the exam- 
ple, which I prophesy will be widely copied?

REPORTS OF WORK OF MOTHERS’ ASSOCIATIONS. 
MRS. C. A. PERKINS, KNOXVILLE, TENN. 
Tue work of the Mothers’ Associations, both in Knoxville 
and throughout the entire country, is attracting general atten- 
tion. There are eleven associations within the limits of Knox- 
ville proper, and several in the suburbs, with a membership of 
over five hundred and fifty. 
The purpose of these organizations is well stated when they 
say in their constitutions: “The object of this Society shall be 
to codperate with our city school officials and instructors for 
better educational advantages and a closer sympathy and codp- 
eration between the home and school.” 
In these purposes they have succeeded most admirably, as 
the following items gleaned from their report show: 
“Since the organization of the first Association, that of the 
Rose avenue school, up to the present time, the money procured 
from dues of members, donations, sales, lectures, entertain- 
ments, etc., amounts to $5,208.38. In the Rose Avenue School 
three hundred dollars has been given by members of the Asso- 
ciation. 
“This has been expended in a variety of ways. School build- 
ings and grounds have been beautified and rendered more 
attractive and sanitary. Rooms have been papered, walls tinted 
an:l hung with pictures, while, in some cases, pieces of statuary 
have been used in the adornment of the rooms. 
“Over five thousand volumes have been placed in the differ- 
ent schools by the Associations, and some have funds on hand 
to be expended in the purchase of books. In the high school 
the books are being catalogued by the system used in large 
public libraries. 
 
-P-A-G-E-147
    JOURNAL OF PROOEHEDINGS. 147 
“School books have also been supplied by other Associations 
to children who could not afford to buy them. Two societies 
report several dozen of shoes, stockings, underclothing, dresses 
and coats given to those in need. Another Association reports 
one hundred families aided in this way. 
“Medical assistance has been rendered in the homes. Even 
nurses have been sent to care for the sick children, and thereby 
the poor mothers are taught principles of sanitation and needed 
reform in housekeeping. 
“At Christmas time the hearts of many children in the 
schools were gladdened by gifts of candy, toys and clothing 
sent to them through the Knosville Sentinel. In one Associa- 
tion different members brought cheer and comfort to various 
homes of the little ones connected with their school. 
“Rest rooms have been established in three schools, and these 
have been comfortably furnished and supplied with medicine 
chests. 
“Lunches, consisting of hot soups, cocoa and sandwiches, 
were served to the children. 
“Material for work in the primary grades has been furnished. 
“Pianos have been put into the buildings, so that at present 
there is not a school but what has the use of such an instrument. 
“Laudable efforts have been made to influence the children 
against the cigarette habit. 
“The recent endeavor to establish a dental clinic is most 
desirable, while the results for the children cannot be over-esti- 
mated. 
“All this and much more has been accomplished for the chil- 
dren, but who can estimate the advantage to the mothers them- 
selves?” 
There is great difficulty in reaching the mothers of poor 
children, but this is being accomplished by having meetings 
which interest these people. Talks have been given on the fol- 
lowing subjects: “Household Economy,” “Prevention of Tuber- 
culosis,” “Food and Digestion,” “Food Values,” “Health of Pu- 
pils,” “Sanitary Lunches and Breakfasts,” “The Relation of 
Parent and Teacher,” “Conditions of the School Room,” ete. 
Some schools have classes by which these mothers are enter- 
tained and instructed. 
Thus these Associations have gone into the homes and have
-P-A-G-E-148
  148 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
brought the housekeeper into the current of affairs, and it is 
this class that has been so greatly benefited. 
The effect of these Associations upon the individual woman 
has been most important, while the helpfulness that has come 
from the mutual contact no one can overestimate. Surely the 
record of these Associations is a most creditable one, and if 
so much has been accomplished in two years, who can judge 
what will be the work of the future? 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
RETARDATION OF PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN. 
ARTHUR HOLMES, PH.D., ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE PSYCHOLOG- 
ICAL CLINIC, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, PHILADELPHIA. 
SECTION I.—WHAT IS RETARDATION? 
The large and increasing consideration given to the subject 
of retardation among school children makes it unnecessary for 
me to dwell upon the importance of this subject to educators. 
Most teachers are more or less familiar with the extent of this 
pedagogical phenomenon, and surely not one has had such a 
brief career in the school room that she has not had some prac- 
tical experience with at least one backward or retarded child. 
Now, to say that a child is “retarded” or “backward” is 
merely to state a fact of observation. One does not allege or 
imply the existence of a physical or mental disease. It may, 
and nearly always does, imply some defect or some lack, and 
sometimes carries with it a condemnation or a commendation 
according to the kind of retardation indicated. This may read- 
ily be seen in the pronouncement that “Mary is not forward in 
company,” or that “Johnny is backward in swearing.” Back- 
wardness in some kinds of sophistication, therefore, is not 
deemed an unmixed evil. In some physiological functions, too, 
like pubescence, for example, late maturity is, in the minds of 
many, beneficial to the individual rather than detrimental. 
Even in mental development, retardation is no more of an evil 
than precociousness. The former may lead to mere slowness 
of progress in life, while the latter may develop into insanity 
or extreme dullness.
-P-A-G-E-149
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 149 
Retardation, then, is merely the name of a relation; a rela- 
tion, too, having meaning only after some standard of normal 
progress is recognized. It means that the backward one is 
behind someone else; he does not go as fast as others; he does 
not keep up with his companion. In every case, a standard, 
or norm, is more or less clearly implied. If the ordinary ob- 
server is asked to make explicit the standard by which he meas- 
ures retarded children, he immediately replies: “Why, the 
standard is the normal child, meaning by that the usual, aver- 
age or typical child. In comparison with him all others are 
abnormal, unusual or atypical.” Such a classification has the 
merit of simplicity, at least, but it suffers because we never have 
a real, live, average, normal or typical child to set up before 
us for examination and comparison. Exactly what those terms 
mean, therefore, is hard to say. They do have a meaning, and 
a fairly definite one, in the minds of all those dealing with chil- 
dren in any considerable numbers. Each child contributes his 
quota to the composite mental picture growing in the expert’s 
mind. Those children diverging from the usual to a more or 
less definite extent, or in certain characteristics, are called ab- 
normal or atypical. But, just how to define or accurately de- 
scribe the normal, or abnormal child, is difficult in the extreme 
because of the multitude, minuteness and individually insignifi- 
cant characteristics to be taken into consideration. In all but 
extreme and striking diversions from type, it is the cumulative 
effect of many casually unnoticed characteristics which deter- 
mines the experienced observer in his judgment, and gives that 
judgment more the quality of an intuition than of a reasoned 
conclusion. Because of the fact, in the examination of chil- 
dren, experience on the part of the examiner will probably 
always count for more than either methods of examination or 
kinds of tests used. 
On account of this ambiguity, students of backwardness 
have given much thought to the formulation of a standard at 
once practicable, objective and precise. Three such standards 
have been suggested which may be called the individual, social 
and pedagogical, respectively. 
The first, or individual standard, erects an imaginary norm, 
and attempts to measure the child by himself, or by his own 
possible achievements. That is, the fullest, all-round develop-
-P-A-G-E-150
  150 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ment possible for anyone is accepted as the standard of that 
one’s normal condition, and anything short of that is called 
retardation. The measure seems precise enough, but it is im- 
possible to apply it. What one ought to be, or would be, under 
right conditions, mentally, physically or morally, is purely im- 
aginary and problematical. Probably no one feels that he has 
had the fullest and fairest chance, and that with some other 
possible environment and training he would have been far more 
advanced intellectually, and possibly his acquaintances concur 
in the opinion. The acceptance of such a judgment, therefore, 
would make us all “backward” or “retarded.” Even if the 
standard of fullest development is rendered precise and final 
by saying it consists in the most perfect possible development 
of each individual cortical cell and cerebral tract, it comes no 
nearer to a practical application. The perfection of cerebral 
svstems—to say nothing of reflex centers and peripheral organs 
—is as remotely imaginable as the possible perfection of psychic 
powers. 
The second, or social standard, springs to mind quite natu- 
rally. It represents the judgment of the community upon any- 
one’s mental ability by comparing him with others in their 
daily lives of work and play. The everyday observation that a 
certain child does not learn common things like dressing, wash- 
ing, eating and playing games as rapidly as his brothers or sis- 
ters did at his age, or as readily as his companions do, may be 
of value and significance insofar as it calls attention to the 
need of fuller investigation. But the social standard expressed 
in the opinions of parents, friends or teachers, is altogether too 
biased and crude to act as a scientific measurement. Though 
it may go so far as to establish the presumption that the child 
is subnormal, it does not begin to be precise enough for deter- 
mining the exact degree of subnormality or backwardness. 
Binet*. has endeavored to make this standard precise and appli- 
cable by working out a series of tests based upon the mental 
capacities of normal children from three to thirteen years. 
For teachers, however, the pedagogical standard and its de- 
velopment may offer a subject of more immediate interest. The

widespread investigations recently begun, and still going on 
in school retardation, demanded a measure at once exact and 
objective. Naturally, class grades were turned to for aid and 
public school gradations, with some modifications, were adopted 
as the best measurement at hand. Assuming that a normal 
child was promoted from one grade to another each year, early 
investigators adopted as their first standard the correspond- 
ence between grade standing and age. Thus it was arbitrarily 
decided that children who begin school at the legal age, and 
are promoted every year, are normal; those who started to 
school at a later age, or those who, for any reason, were not 
promoted in due season, are backward or retarded. However, 
it was soon discovered that in the first school under investiga- 
tion such a standard would throw nearly three-quarters of the 
pupils into the backward class. Therefore, the norm was 
changed, and only those who were two years or more behind 
the grades corresponding to their age were counted retarded.? 
SECTION II.—THE FACTS IN THE CASE. 
Having now found our touchstone in the shape of any object- 
ive test of backwardness, we will proceed to apply it to the 
great army of seventeen million school children of America. 
Beginning with the pioneer work of Superintendent James E. 
Bryan, of Camden, N. J., reports for 1905-06 show that in that 
citv the percentage of children two years or more behind the 
grade proper for their ages was 2614 per cent in an enrollment 
of 12,800.? 
The conditions in the Camden school are typical rather than 
exceptional. Dr. Bryan’s investigations were, in general, con- 
firmed and corroborated by the extension of statistical inquiry 
to five city school systems published in 1908 by Dr. Oliver O. 
Cornman.*

Dr. Cornman’s findings were, in some measure, corrected and 
largely expanded but not materially altered by Dr. Roland P. 
Falkner, in the May number of the Clinic for the same year.* 
The most recent utterances upon the subject of retardation 
in public schools come from the investigators working under 
the Russell Sage Foundation. They have taken up the problem 
in the United States upon a basis commensurate with its mag- 
nitude and importance. The results of their research into 
thirty-one cities in America have been published by Leonard 
P. Ayres, Secretary of the Backward Children Investigation, 
in a volume entitled, “Laggards in Our Schools.” It is the 
latest as well as the most comprehensive compilation of facts 
and discussions of remediable measures extant upon the subject. 
Chapter IV. presents a condensed discussion of backwardness 
among school children, and a summary of results in tabular 
form. For the thirty-one cities the percentages are as follows:

  From the foregoing figures an increasing conception of the 
enormity of the problem may be gained. Of the 17,061,962 
public school pupils reported by the Commissioner of Educa- 
tion, 33.7 per cent, or a little more than one-third, will prob- 
ably leave school at the legal age without completing their com- 
mon school education. An army of the same total, with 5,749,- 
881 stragglers, or any army with a like proportion of stragglers, 
would be a perilous foundation for a State to base its hope of 
stability and continued prosperity upon. In democratic Amer- 
ica the school children of today will form the foundations of 
our Republic in the next generation, and one of the largest, if 
not the largest, stone in the foundation of any Republic is the 
intelligence of its citizens. 
SECTION III.—CAUSES OF RETARDATION. 
After the definition of retardation comes the facts, and after 
the facts come the causes. Here we enter upon the deeper and 
more intricate phases of our problem. For, obviously, if retar- 
dation is defined as low grade distribution of pupils, it may 
have a multitude of causes. A late start to school, irregular 
attendance, poor teaching, complex and advanced curricula, 
innutritious diet, bad roads, home ideals, defective eyesight, 
dull hearing, pharyngeal obstructions, natural stupidiy, men- 
tal deficiency—almost ad infinitum could the list be continued. 
All causes, however, for convenience sake, may be roughly clas- 
sified, (@) those external to the child, and (6) those within the 
child itself. The external causes may be again classified under 
the heads of (1) social, including those in the (a) home and 
   
-P-A-G-E-154
  154 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
(b) neighborhood, and (2) pedagogical. The internal causes, 
on the other hand, are always (1) physical, in the sense of 
physiological or anatomical abnormalities, and are (a) curable 
or (b) incurable. Upon the last distinction depends the grand 
division of children into those temporarily retarded because of 
some unavoidable defect, and those permanently retarded in 
life because of incurable nervous lesions, producing imbecility 
or idiocy, or “weak-mindedness,” or “feeble-mindedness,” as it 
is properly called. 
Investigators into school retardation have so far reported 
little upon social and pedagogical causes, though school lunches, 
playgrounds, school gardens and other social and pedagogical 
measures have been inaugurated chiefly upon the plea of help- 
ing pupils denied these social aids to education. On the other 
hand, investigations into causes within the child itself have 
been fairly well reported. These inquiries have sought to find 
both the relation between remediable physical defects and slow 
school progress, and the relation between irremediable nervous 
defects and slow progress, though not always with the desired 
discrimination between those radical and vital distinctions be- 
tween causes. We will consider, first, those results bearing 
upon retardation through removable physiological defect. 
RETARDATION THROUGH REMEDIAL PHYSICAL DEFECTS. 
Diseases of eyes and ears have long been popularly consid- 
ered as immediate and final obstacles to absorption of knowl- 
edge by pupils taught by ordinary school room methods. 
Though usually more remotely and in a less degree than eye or 
ear defects, pharyngeal and nasal affections, dental caries and 
tartar, anaumia, malnutrition, indigestion and bowel troubles 
have all been alleged as causes of delay in mental progress. 
Limited statistical inquiry into the relation of the physical 
condition of children and mentality do not wholly substantiate 
these general views. A summary of results is given by Mr. 
Ayres in his previously quoted book, “Laggards in Our 
Schools,” in Chapter XI. 
RETARDATION THROUGH INCURABLE NERVOUS LESIONS. 
In the vast army of nearly six million backward school chil- 
dren, mingling with those who are retarded through remediable
-P-A-G-E-155
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 155 
physical defects, march—or rather stumble along—the partially 
estimated number of those unfortunates who suffer from in- 
curable lesions of the nervous system, the imbeciles and idiots, 
who have found their way into our school system. The total 
number in America, though fewer than their more fortunate 
fellow sufferers, is almost astounding. The Education Com- 
missioner’s report for 1909 gives but a sinister hint of the real 
situation. 
“Tables 185, 186 and 187 summarize the statistics of the 
twenty-six State schools and the seventeen private schools for 
the feebleminded. The State institutions had 17,549 inmates, 
only 10,679 being reported in a school or kindergarten. The 
seventeen private institutions had 927 inmates, the number in 
school or kindergarten being 424. Tables 188 and 189 give in 
detail the statistics of public and private schools for the feeble- 
minded.” 
These figures, indicating as bad a figure as they do, do not 
nearly express the real state of affairs as estimated by experts. 
Though all of the State institutions are crowded, and each has 
a long waiting list of applicants, there remain thousands of 
unknown and uncounted mental defectives at large who ought 
to be segregated and sequestered in proper colonies. 
According to these estimates one hundred thousand to one 
hundred and eighty thousand defectives with irremediable nerv- 
ous lesions, rendering them unfit for social life and propaga- 
tion of their kind, live in the United States today. Of this vast 
number, an estimated 10 per cent are in public and private in- 
stitutions; the other 90 per cent are pursuing their unrestricted 
way, some at home, some at work, some idlers, tramps, loafers 
or criminals, and some at school clogging and diverting its 
energies from proper channels in a vain attempt to teach the 
uneducable and unteachable things. How many of the total 
number are being deprived of any training whatever, and who 
roam the streets at will, no one knows. Certain it is that every 
hamlet, every village, every town and every large city in an 
increasing proportion has its quota of children designated as 
“foolish,” “silly,” “not all there,” or “lacking in the upper 
story” or “queer.” Heretofore, these unfortunate ones, thought 
to be objects of special visitation by Providence and unable to 
succeed in the public schools by the traditional methods of edu-

cation, have been accepted as burdens by their parents or by 
the community, and no special effort made, or even thought of, 
for the alleviation of their condition. 
Nore 1.—Statistical Studies for the British Isles place the number of 
feeble-minded imbeciles and idiots at 3.28 per 1,000 for certain sections 
studied by the Royal Commissioner of 1904. See Mental Deficiency, 
A. F. Tredgold, 1908, 4-9. 
As it has already intimated, the foregoing investigations into 
the causes of backwardness have been somewhat rough and 
preliminary. Very probably the resulting statistics represent 
very closely the actual conditions, but the methods and the 
conditions under which the examinations were made rendered 
it impossible to designate further the degrees of mental defi- 
ciency in those discovered to be subnormal. For illustrations 
and descriptions of such a diagnosis we will now turn to the 
Psychological Clinic, University of Pennsylvania. The clinic 
was founded in 1896 by Dr. Lightner Witmer, Professor of 
Psychology, for the discovery and accurate differentiation of 
causes of retardation in individual children, and for adminis- 
ering advice and direction in pedagogical measures for their 
advancement in study. 
When a child in school or at home exhibits such unmistakable 
signs of mental or moral deviation as to be brought to the 
clinic, the clinician is then confronted with this situation. 
Here is a deviate. What is the cause of the deviation? Is it 
an environmental or a mere physical defect amenable to refor- 
mation or surgical or medical treatment? Or, is it an incurable 
organic lesion of the central or peripheral nervous system? 
If the former is true, as we have already said, the child is 
merely a temporary deviate, and may be restored to its normal 
position in life and make progress indefinitely in mental attain- 
ments. If the latter is true, the child is mentally deficient, and 
can be trained only to the limit of its capacity, and there must 
stop in lifelong imbecility or idiocy. The vital distinction, then, 
between classes of unusual children is not in the fundamental 
differences of causes, but in the curability or incurability of the 
causes. All the causes involved are, in a sense, physical, 
whether classed as brain lesions or bad neighborhood. Some 
are removable; some are not. Therein lies the insurmountable 
difference and the basis for sharp differentiation between the

mentally defective, weak-minded or feeble-minded, aments 
dementus, moral degenerates and the others. 
A mental diagnosis, then, is really a classification and a 
pedagogical prognosis, or prophecy, combined. That is, thé 
judgment pronounced at the end of an examination upon a 
certain case does not at all state the present intellectual attain- 
ments of the child. What the child now knows is an indication 
of its mentality, but not a final one. What it will learn, or can 
know under certain conditions and with proper methods of 
training, is the all important and decisive question. Therefore, 
it may happen that of two children of the same age, one may 
show marked superiority in intellectual attainments as meas- 
ured by public school standards, and yet be judged an imbecile, 
while the other is considered normal. The learned child has 
had training, the latter has not. The diagnosis predicts that 
the former can learn only so much, will then reach its full men- 
tal capacity, and from that time remain stationary or recede 
from its best attainments. On the other hand, the capacity of 
the normal child is an unpredictable quantity or quality, and 
its progress has not present assignable limits. Further, it may 
even happen that of two children, the one giving the brightest 
answers and more normal reactions may be pronounced the 
imbecile. For the more stupid one may be made temporarily 
so by the presence of some physical defect, like diseased ears, 
which can be remedied and the sufferer restored to normality. 
With the other, the physical defect is present, it is true, but it 
is of such a nature that a cure is impossible. 
The problem of diagnosis, then, is to determine which class 
any suspected retarded child belongs to. To do this, the best 
method, theoretically, would be a direct examination of the 
child’s nervous anatomy. If the non-development of a cerebral 
lobe, or scar tissues from previous meningitis, for example, 
could be discovered, the pronouncement might be immediate 
and final as to the prognosis. In some related cases, as brain 
tumors, such a course of direct inspection might conceivably 
be made by means of the X-ray, and the cause of temporary 
dementia removed. In still other cases, the required evidence 
is still more accessible. Wherever end organs of sense have 
been irretrievably destroyed at an early age the corresponding 
cereral centers, both primary and associational, must, of neces- 
 
-P-A-G-E-158
  158 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
sity, suffer a permanent stoppage of development, and, hence, 
imbecility or “idiocy by deprivation,” as it is called, must 
result. 
Some such instancés of dementia, though thoroughly in 
accord with the scientific classification by irremediable causes, 
furnish striking exceptions to the popular conceptions of idiocy. 
No ordinary layman would think of Helen Keller as mentally 
defective or an imbecile. Yet, strictly speaking, in spite of 
her acquisition of French, German, Latin and Greek, her early 
brilliant intellectual performances, she is, and must always 
remain, a mental defect. For she early suffered the permanent 
loss of hearing and eyesight, and no amount of training has 
been able to wholly overcome the loss. Color and sound to her 
must ever remain unknown and unknowable sensations. Her 
visual and auditory centers have remained unstimulated 
through long years, and, like all other unusued organs, have 
not been developed and cannot be. Had it not been for the 
labors of Periere with deaf mutes, she might have remained 
dumb, .and all that opportunity for self-expression through 
speech would have been cut off and profounder idiocy resulted. 
Such examples are illuminating both to point out clearly the 
meaning of and also to illustrate the theoretical method for the 
discovery of mental deficiency. 
In the vast majority of cases, however, the diagnosis is not 
nearly so direct or simple. It is necessary to come at the causes 
by more indirect methods. At the Psychological Clinic four 
different examinations are made. First, a general report cov- 
ering information concerning post-natal, natal and pre-natal 
causes of mental deficiency is obtained. Beginning with the 
present, the life history of the child is first secured. In this 
a few preliminary questions will determine the nature of the 
deviation, and determine whether it is mental or moral; if 
mental, whether the child is advanced, erratic or retarded in 
his intellectual capacities. After this, if the child is of school 
age, his pedagogical history is inquired into. The statements 
concerning his age and the grade in which he is, determine the 
question of the degree of backwardness. When these prelim- 
inary facts are before the clinician he is ready to proceed with 
his case and to begin his real search for causes. Thus he may 
uncover the history of certain diseases, some of which are cer-
-P-A-G-E-159
  JOURNAL OF PROOHEDINGS. 159 
tain, some probable, and some possible causes of mental defi- 
ciency. For example, if the child has suffered from a bad case 
of spinal meningitis, which is most likely to leave a scar tissue 
upon the cerebrum, permanent mental deficiency is almost cer- 
tain to follow. If epileptic seizures have begun early and are 
gradually increasing in frequency, a severe mental deteriora- 
tion is also likewise almost sure. If no special diseases develop 
in the history of the child’s life, birth injuries may reveal some 
natal causes affecting his mentality. If this is not true, family 
history may reveal some neuroses like insanity, epilepsy or men- 
tal deficiency in the parents, grandparents or collateral 
branches of the family, and by the law of heredity produce an 
almost’ certain conviction of the permanent mental deviation of 
the subjects examined. 
After the general report, obtained by questioning the parents, 
has been completed, a physical examination is made by a medi- 
cal attendant in order to discover two things. First, the pres- 
ence of removable physical defects, and, second, the presence 
of congenital physical defects or stigmata. Upon the quality 
or number of the latter may depend the judgment of the child’s 
mental deficiencies. Upon the presence of the first no imme- 
diate judgment can be made. Removable physical defects must 
be first removed and the effect upon the mental capacity of the 
child noted before final judgment can be made. 
The mental diagnosis proper follows the physical examina- 
tion. First, beginning with the pedagogical examination of the 
child, and using the ordinary examination questions of the pub- 
lic school for testing what the child has learned, and for deter- 
mining, further, if he is backward, the degree of his backward- 
ness, measured by ordinary school standards, may be learned. 
In the case of children who cannot read or write, or are 
younger than the school age, the Binet tests are used for the 
same purpose. If the mental retardation of the child has been 
determined by these two tests, the mental analysis is then taken 
up by which an attempt is made to locate the cause of retarda- 
tion is some specific mental defect. For this purpose many tests 
are used for processes of sensation, perception, memory, imagi- 
nation, ideation and reason. In general, they may be summa- 
rized as censory, motor and complex mental tests. 
When these tests are completed the examiner not only knows 
 
-P-A-G-E-160
  160 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the degree of retardation, but he has arrived at a very clear 
conception of these causes residing within the child itself, is 
able to locate them either in the physical or mental being of 
the child, and is ready to advise certain definite means of train- 
ing in order to overcome the defect as soon as possible. 
However, a sociological examination of the home and neigh- 
borhood, with a report of the conditions there, which may 
effect either the future training or the present mental state of 
the child, is also obtained, and often throws a great deal of 
light upon the whole problem in hand. 
The outcome of a clinical diagnosis is vital. It decides defi- 
nitely whether the case is one of curable or incurable mental or 
moral deviation. In the former case the child either returns 
directly to his graded class after the correction of his remediable 
physical defects, or to some special class where his education 
proceeds with more intensive methods with a view to his ulti- 
mate restoration to the regular grades of the public school. 
In the latter case, those interested are made aware that the 
mentally deficient child will require, all his life, a method of 
training in general altogether different from that given in the 
public school, and, in particular, a special grade of instruction 
suited to his special grade of intelligence. The importance of 
rightly disposing of him cannot be overestimated. For a wrong 
disposal not only wastes time and money, but injures the de- 
fective. For here, greater than anywhere else, either too little 
or too much teaching is signally injurious. Money and time 
may be worse than wasted, normal children may be neglected, 
and abnormal may be injured, and, finally, society may be bur- 
dened by another generation of defects due to the removal of 
barriers to marriage by the removal of salutary stigma through 
a so-called public school education. .The proper differentiation 
and treatment of these two classes of children becomes, there- 
fore, one of the most far-reaching problems of public school 
administration. 
THE OUTLOOK AND SOME SUGGESTED REMEDIES. 
In considering the outlook and suggesting remedies for re- 
tardation, the magnitude of the condition itself and the intri- 
cate ramifications of attendant circumstances must be duly 
considered in any prophecy or any suggestions for betterment. 
First, in regard to the outlook for retardation in public school,
-P-A-G-E-161
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 161 
the conditions are a little better than a few years ago, though 
the “hopeful tendencies are far from being either universal or 
decided. Where they are encouraging, they are so inconsider- 
able in degree as to indicate very plainly that retardation is not 
any evil which will be self-eradicating if neglected.” Remedies 
must be applied if the pedagogical disease is to be cured. 
In suggesting remedies, we must again bring our primary 
distinction between curable and incurable backwardness into 
prominence. First, for children retarded on account of physio- 
logical or environmental removable causes, we need : 
1. Social reforms beginning in the home with a better supply 
of well cooked, nourishing food, clean water, fresh air, refresh- 
ing sleep, extending to the neighborhood in less crowded, more 
sanitary conditions, more air spaces, more playgrounds, and, 
reaching into factories where children work too young, too long 
hours and under conditions physically, morally and intellect: 
ually bad. 
2. School methods should be still more considerate of the 
individual child and not the tax rate nor the educational sys- 
tem. Curricula can be weeded of still more tares without injury 
to the wheat. Manual training and industrial schools are help- 
ing pupils who, because of weakened bodies or minds, demand 
that teachers proceed from the concrete to the abstract. Spe- 
cial classes and special schools, both ungraded, are performing 
wonders with some retarded pupils, but woe unto that commu- 
nity that makes such classes dumping grounds into which are 
promiscuously cast ‘the physically defective, the mentally un- 
sound and the morally incorrigible. As surely as an ounce of 
yeast leavens a pound of dough, so surely will the vicious con- 
taminate the rest. 
3. Medical inspection should be extended and made more in- - 
tensive. 
4. Some kind of follow-up method must be inaugurated to 
see that defective pupils receive medical and surgical treat- 
ment when needed. 
5. Institutions, like the free Psychological Clinic at the Uni- 
versity of Pennsylvania, for accurate diagnosis of retardation 
by experts, with a social department for aiding children seek- 
ing medical treatment or admissions to institutions, should be 
extended to every city school system. 
11 
 
-P-A-G-E-162
  162 SOUTHERN HDUOATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
6. Hospital schools for observation and treatment, both med- 
ical and pedagogical, of borderland children, should be estab- 
lished. Secondly, for those incurably deficient: 
1. Under improved conditions absolute elimination from 
public schools should be the inexorable law. With the inaugu- 
ration of the institutions in five and six above, the discovery 
of such cases and their diagnosis could proceed with certainty 
and exactness. 
2. The first firm elimination should be followed by the merci- 
ful segregation and congregation of the mentally incurable in 
colonies where they could spend their lives in happy and useful 
occupations suited to their grades of mentality, but where they 
would not increase the already overwhelming and increasing 
army of their own kind. 
These remedies may seem to be revolutionary and remote. 
They may be both, but they are necessary. They are presented 
before this highly intelligent audience in order to give some 
notion of the magnitude of the problem already existing, to 
suggest the colossal task before teachers and laymen alike, and 
to indicate the enormity of the sin of neglect.

“SHOULD INDUSTRIAL AND MANUAL TRAINING BE 
TAUGHT IN THE GRAMMAR GRADES.” 
MRS. HENRY MEIER, NORMAN, OKLA. 
InpustriaL and manual training are two of the most impor- 
tant branches of education that can be taught in the grammar 
grades of our public schools. What we call common school 
branches are taught to prepare the student for such life work 
in which he may engage after he has finished his schooling. 
Then why should he not receive some industrial training at 
school which will enable him to get employment in the indus- 
try of his choice without the later loss of much time, which 
must be spent in learning a trade. If the industrial and man- 
ual work finds a place on the school programme, just as the 
purely intellectual subjects do, the pupil will at the end of his 
education find himself normally developed, a trained mind and 
a skilled hand.
-P-A-G-E-163
    JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 163 
It has often been proven that a mind and hand actively en- 
gaged in any good work finds no time to do wrong. In our 
prisons the convicts are taught the various kinds of trades to 
employ them during confinement, as well as to enable them to 
earn a livelihood after their release, and statistics have shown 
that the majority of convicts had never learned a trade. How 
much better for them had they been taught at school. 
We train our minds by studying certain subjects; we de- 
velop our muscles by exercising them in various ways; then 
why not combine both in our grammar grades and thus help 
the individual to become an independent member of the human 
household. While our public schools have laid stress princi- 
pally on “culture,” as the end of education, almost no stress 
has been placed on preparation for a vocation. The State Nor- 
mal Schools and universities have educated professional men 
and women in all lines, and our elementary and high schools 
together constitute one continuous educational scheme through 
which a youth may secure the elements of general culture. 
Thus we see the educational scheme of our schools is more in 
the interest of those who have a long educational career before 
them, and who need not pay immediate attention to the prepa- 
ration of a life-work. 
The greater mass of our school children must leave school at 
the end of the grammar school period, so that the public school 
system does not reach the majority of our youth during the 
critical period of adolescence. At this time, when the child 
becomes a youth, life’s aims begin to have a serious and lasting 
importance; when the habits formed rapidly acquire perma- 
nence. Yet during this period, the majority of our young peo- 
ple are sent into the world, often without any comprehension 
of the serious purposes of life. Statistics taken in some of our 
Eastern States show that twenty-five thousand boys and girls 
between the ages of fourteen and sixteen are not in school. 
They are working in stores, offices, or as wagon drivers, where 
only nominal wages are paid, and where there is no chance at 
all for improvement in knowledge nor advancement in pay. 
Thus when they are at manhood’s threshold they receive no 
more than they did at fourteen, nor have they gained any 
knowledge which would be profitable to them. On the con- 
trary, they probably have forgotten the little they did know
-P-A-G-E-164
  164 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
when they first started out as wage-earners. What kind of a 
citizen will such a boy or girl make? This is a serious prob- 
lem. On the other hand, the fact has been revealed that these 
same children would have remained in school, if the schools 
would have afforded a training that promised increased earn- 
ing capacity. 
In every line of manufacturing or commerce, “workmen 
worthy of their hire” are sought, and the greater the ability 
in applying oneself, the higher the wages demanded and also 
paid. Therefore, to enable the youth of our resourceful land 
to get the most good out of life for themselves, and be able to 
pass it on to others. Industrial and manual training should 
be taught in the grammar grades. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
SOME OBJECTIONS TO CONSOLIDATION ANSWERED. 
L. J. HANIFAN, CHARLESTON, W. VA. 
In this paper I propose to treat objections to consolidation 
under two heads: those which appeal to the imagination and 
prejudice and those which appeal to reason and to discuss the 
former first. 
One of the most unreasonable objections offered is that it is 
new and that we want to stay with the good old plan that has 
always worked well. This is mere prejudice and is offered 
alike to the introduction of any kind of invention or improve- 
ment. To a large number of people this objection is sufficient, 
and we are left to work up sentiment with the younger and 
more progressive spirits until these introduce improvements 
over the protest of the nearsighted. The majority should rule, 
and a conversion of a majority is necessary unless progressive 
boards have enough backbone to take the initiative and exer- 
cise their authority in establishing better schools. 
Another objection is to the giving up of the old schoolhouse. 
This is not quite so unreasonable as the first mentioned, but it 
is serious. The people must be convinced that it is merely a 
means of enlarging their lives and of widening the boundaries 
of their world by a few miles. They must come to see that just 
as the telephone brings a larger community into speaking dis- 
 
-P-A-G-E-165
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 165 
tance of them so the consolidated school brings them even 
nearer to their community life by the means of transportation 
and centralization. It enlarges their lives and provides for a 
real community centre of the larger type. 
It is often objected that we are trying to establish city 
schools in the country. This is simply a mistaken idea. No 
such intent exists. It is planned more thoroughly to correlate 
the schools with their enviornment, and it is generally recog- 
nized that this desired correlation can be more thorough in the 
country than in the city. 
Two financial objections are that consolidation costs more 
and that it depreciates farm values. Neither of these conten- 
tions can be established. On the other hand, it is the opinion 
of many of the best authorities that it does not cost more and 
that it enhances farm values. It is contended by school men 
that with consolidation as good schools can be maintained 
with less money, and that better schools can be maintained 
with the same money. Superintendent Hyatt, of California, 
states: “A good school six miles away with transportation 
will add more to the value of a farm than a poor school brought 
to within a quarter of a mile.” 
The source of another objection is the fear that the morals 
of the children will be endangered. What safer means could 
be devised for guarding the morals of children than those em- 
ployed in transportation? A responsible man is in charge of 
the children from their homes to the school and again from 
the school to their homes, while the children are under the 
direction of the teachers all the time they are at school. Girls 
especially are safer, since they are not exposed to vagabonds 
that sometimes lie in wait along lonesome roads. And no vile 
language is allowed in the wagons. 
Another objection is that transportation is injurious to the 
health of the pupils. This point is well worth careful consid- 
eration, but experience seems to bear out the belief that with 
lap robes, an oil stove and properly arranged wagons, pupils 
run much less risk of sickness than they do when they walk to 
school, and often have to sit away from the stove with wet 
feet and clothing. Under proper conditions pupils can be kept 
warm. Any failure to do so is a matter of administration and 
should not be charged up to the plan of consolidation as such.  
-P-A-G-E-166
  166 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Poor administration of school funds is not to be tolerated, but 
for this reason no community should abandon the schools any 
more than the courts should. be abolished because occasionally 
a criminal escapes or an innocent man is punished. 
Certainly the consolidated school building will be made 
more sanitary and attractive than the one-room schools are 
likely to be. 
There are many positive advantages of consolidation, and if 
we turn from the negative side to the positive we find among 
other advantages the following: 
1. The consolidated school attracts and can afford to secure 
and hold the best teachers. It can even rival the city schools 
in securing good teachers, and these teachers by close associa- 
tion will develop a professional enthusiasm not possible in the 
scattered one-room schools. 
2. The larger number of pupils will develop a better school 
spirit in the school and on the playground. 
3. Consolidation secures better supervision than is possible 
for the one-room schools. 
4, It provides for better buildings and better equipment and 
makes possible the introduction of agriculture, domestic 
science, manual training, art and music. 
5. It secures better attendance and eliminates the truant of- 
ficer from the pay rools. 
The two objections that apply to reason are the sparsity of 
the population and the bad roads. 
Where the population is scattered over the hills and down 
in the hollows it may not be advisable to consolidate. Each 
community must be the judge of its conditions and act ac- 
cordingly. 
The bad roads constitute a real objection, and if they are im- 
passable consolidation with transportation is impossible. But 
consolidation is an incentive to build better roads. The bad 
roads are no more of an impediment to consolidation than they 
are to getting to markets and to travel generally. If a com- 
munity will simply give up and say there is no use the roads 
may never be better. Good roads mean better improvement of 
rural life and the schools constitute only one of the forces for 
bettering rural life. 
Furthermore, people are accustomed to say the roads are too
-P-A-G-E-167
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 167 
bad for horses to travel, but are willing to let their children 
travel the same roads to school. Does the farmer say: “The 
roads are too bad for me to ride to town and, therefore, I shall 
walk?” If we take into consideration the possibility of im- 
proving the roads and the other advantages of having good 
roads and bad roads, objection really becomes a mere excuse.

TECHNICAL EDUCATION OUR GREATEST NEED. 
PROF. P. H. ROLES, DIRECTOR, FLORIDA AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT 
STATION. 
Tup stress of the times is upon us. Our own people are 
calling for facts and figures. Never before in the history of 
our country has there been such a clamor for information of 
a technical nature. The farms are being harder pressed for 
service than ever before. In addition to the natural increase 
of our own people, the tide of immigration is setting in south- 
ward. The great flood of surplus population which for a hun- 
dred years had found its outlet toward the West has at last 
filled that West, and now the stream is setting in southward. 
This calls for more leaders—not half-prepared boys, but real 
trained leaders. Every State in the South is demanding men 
who can do something right now—not ten years hence. 
The education of our young men, unfortunately, has been 
away from agriculture. The high school, the academy, the col- 
lege, and even our universities, have bent much, and often 
nearly all, of their energies to making professional men on the 
old lines—such as law, medicine and theology. Altogether too 
few of our agricultural students have been trained sufficiently 
to make leaders in their particular lines. Many of those who 
have been well trained have found more inviting surroundings 
in some Northern institution. This is usually the fault of the 
home State. A sojourn for a longer or shorter time under 
changed conditions is most healthful and helpful, but the 
trouble lies in the fact that the surroundings have not been 
conducive to bring back to us the ablest of our young men 
after their ability has been proven. It is not the purpose of 
this address to criticise any institution or any person for the

want of congenial surroundings or permanency in tenure of 
office. These matters are mere incidents along the way, and 
while detracting and irritating in themselves, they are neither 
the cause nor the results of the metamorphosis through which 
we are now passing. It is merely one of the symptoms which 
indicate that we are going through. the throes of widening our 
scope of learning, of increasing our vision. Every large Ameri- 
can educational institution has drawn from us one or more 
of their leaders. Naturally, our Southern institutions have 
returned the compliment by reaching out for trained men. The 
unfortunate part of this barter is that we have been so fre- 
quently the losing party in this exchange. Florida, as well as 
other Southern States, has been a veritable training field for 
the more wealthy institutions. As a general rule, inbreeding 
in the university and experiment station is not good in prin- 
ciple. The home-trained man who rises above local narrow- 
ness is the exception. One has to get away from home to be 
able to see it in its true perspective. That is why we are here 
today. Every one of us knows that his work will suffer tem- 
porarily, but every one of us feels that he must get out of the 
narrow valley and get onto the top of Lookout Mountain to 
really see the valley; to see the onward march of this great 
Southland; to get a comprehensive view of its problems and 
the really small part each individual is playing in its develop- 
ment. Let me make my meaning more concrete. There is not 
a crop grown but could be made vastly more productive. A 
few leaders in every line have shown this to be true. Taking 
corn, the largest of our farm crops, as an example. Florida 
raised on the average thirteen bushels of corn to the acre, yet 
the maximum yield for this year was 105 bushels per acre. 
Last year Florida raised an average of 12.6 bushels per acre, 
with a maximum yield of 115 bushels per acre. 
South Carolina has challenged the world for two decades in 
her maximum yield of corn. Here and now we need our expert 
surveyor who can traverse every foot of ground between the 
thirteen bushels per acre and the 105 bushels per acre. We 
need the man; yes, a whole army of men, to lead all of us over 
the whole route. We are common, everyday men and need an 
arrow or a blaze at every turn or corner. We must labor pa- 
tiently along from seed selection, through planting, fertilizing,
-P-A-G-E-169
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 169 
cultivating, to the harvesting of the crop. This crop needs ex- 
perts who have had the foundation of their education laid in 
scientific studies. Such men will be able to point out the 
causes for the failure, on the one hand, and the reasons for 
success on the other. We are in greatest need of men who can 
get above the rule of thumb methods and reason out the causes 
from the effects. Men who can dissociate themselves from the 
ordinary routine of daily life and see the problem as a whole. 
In other words, real leaders. They must also have the time to 
digest their thought for clearer expression. 
CONCLUSION. 
1. We have reached the point as a nation where we consume 
all the bread stuffs we produce, and in this decade we must 
begin to answer the question as to whether we will be an inde- 
pendent or a dependent nation; dependent upon others for food 
stuffs. Our great Southland must play a major part in this 
development if we would be true to ourselves. 
2. The first great step lies through the education of the 
masses. 
3. To educate the masses properly we must have a greatly 
enlarged number of expert agriculturists. 
4, Every one in an executive position in the South knows 
that it is almost impossible to fill even passably well the posi- 
tions open. Poorly trained and poorly adapted men are 
largely responsible for the slow progress we are making. Our 
colleges and universities are largely responsible for this condi- 
tion. [Personal experience. ] 
5. To remedy this our colleges and universities should lay 
greater stress on post-graduate work. This can be accom- 
plished by— 
(a) Every experiment station having from four to ten lab- 
oratory or field assistants chosen from among graduates. 
(b) Every full professor having one or more post-graduate 
students working under him. 
From among these post-graduate students will develop men 
‘who are capable and willing to fill some of the places at least 
that are now begging to find occupants. Such positions should 
pay only enough to enable the occupant to make a good living 
and not enough to make it commercially attractive.

THE ADOLESCENT IMAGINATION: ITS SIGNIFIT- 
CANCE FOR EDUCATION. 
H. W. CHASE, PROFESSOR OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION, UNI- 
VERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, 
Moprrn civilization emphasises so much the practical as- 
pects of life that we often tend to forget the importance of the 
imagination, and to show scant sympathy for the imaginative 
youth. Now adolescence in the springtime of the imagination. 
The adolescent dreams of fame and fortune, of adventure and 
strength and skill. Over all the world is the tinge of romance. 
The reason, which sets limits and bounds, has not yet ma- 
tured; imagination, that ignores in fancy the limitations of 
fact, is at the zenith of its power. 
The present tendency to ignore in our system of education 
any sufficient appeal to the imagination is fraught with a two- 
fold danger. In the first place, education must adapt itself to 
the nature of the child. Hence, any attempt to neglect so vital 
a part of his mentality as the imagination, threatens the youth 
with the dangers of a one-sided development. Especially is 
this so at the period of adolescence, when the imagination un- 
dergoes such a rich and sudden flowering. 
The second great danger following from neglect of the imagi- 
nation is that it will be diverted into wrong channels. The 
world of fancy beckons the youth so resistlessly that his imagi- 
nation must find some outlet. If surroundings are too poor 
and monotonous, this may lead to abnormalities, or even wreck 
the mind. Spiritualism, witchcraft, youthful criminals, des- 
peradoes, fanatics, all show the diverse ways of outlet found 
by the too closely bounded imagination. If the imagination 
be not directed to higher ends, tastes for the low, the sensa- 
tional and the impure will be engendered. One of the great 
lacks in our whole civilization, as well as in our educational 
systems, is that they make no adequate provision for gratify- 
ing in clean and wholesome ways the imaginative longings of 
our youth. 
Now in education appeal to the imagination is more a mat- 
ter of the point of view from which subjects are taught than of
-P-A-G-E-171

the subjects themselves. In the teaching of English, for ex- 
ample, the work has often been made too formal and intel- 
lectual. By giving an opportunity for the pupils to take the 
parts of the characters of which they read, by a more concrete 
method of teaching, by a greater familiarity on the part of the 
teacher with the setting and background of story or play, much 
may be done to make the pupil put himself in the place of the 
characters, to feel and think with them. 
High school physics, to use another illustration, is often 
made too much a matter of mathematics, too abstract, too out 
of touch with nature. The whole world appeals to the adoles- 
cent imagination; the study of physics should be of the most 
absorbing interest had we not made it too artificial. Boys 
should be encouraged in the manufacture of simple apparatus 
the subject should be taught with great regard to its applica- 
tions, and probably less from a quantitative point of view. 
In the same way other subjects should be taught with due 
regard for the imagination, which our present educational sys- 
tems neglect to a dangerous extent.

THE AGRICULTURAL HIGH SCHOOL. 
C. E, BYRD, SHREVEPORT, LA. 
Wuar we shall say is predicated on the assumption that the 
agricultural high school is in no way to interfere with the 
work of the rural elementary school, but is to provide a fitting 
and crowning climax to the results that the former are or 
should accomplish. It should be the natural and normal sup- 
plement to the elementary schools and look to them as the 
source from which to draw a dependable supply of properly 
prepared students whose life occupation and environment are 
in sympathy with the aims and efforts of the high school. 
LOCATION. 
The school should be centrally located, away from the town, 
in a farming community with a population large enough and 
with graded consolidated schools close enough and of easy ac-

cess to furnish the requisite number of students prepared to 
take advantage of its facilities. 
GROUNDS. 
The grounds should be ample for buildings, demonstration 
and experimental purposes, and well drained. 
BUILDINGS. 
The buildings should be properly planned, substantially built 
and provide for class rooms, study halls, laboratories, dormi- 
tories, barns for stock and tools, and for machinery. 
EQUIPMENT. 
It should have ample grounds, well laid off. It should have 
suitable furniture, apparatus, implements and a supply of do- 
mestic animals, such as horses, cows, hogs and fowls, orchards, 
gardens and fields for crops. 
FACULTY. 
The faculty is of paramount importance. The success of the 
school depends on those charged with the responsibility of 
guiding the youth in their studies and activities. We must 
look to our agricultural colleges and State universities for our 
supply of teachers. 
CURRICULUM. 
The courses should be broad and liberal, but practical, with 
definite aims and purposes in view. They should consist of 
academic studies and industrial subjects. The academic sub- 
jects should include: 
English shorn of its technicalities, enriched and made 
dynamic by its applications. It should enable the student to 
interpret the thoughts of others and to express himself clearly, 
orderly and tersely. 
Literature carefully selected and graded should be pursued 
to create a taste for good literature, and to elevate and refine. 
History, which stresses causes and their inevitable effects on 
men and nations, and should emphasize the lives of our own 
great men.
-P-A-G-E-173
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 173 
Mathematics, which should be confined to arithmetic, algebra 
and geometry, and the problems should be selected from the 
activities of the farm and thus made real. 
The sciences should be especially stressed. This is a practi- 
eal and hence a scientific age. Theories and enterprises are 
now subjected to crucial scientific tests. We no longer risk 
labor, time and capital to chance and accident. 
The sciences should comprise: 
1. Physics confined largely to mechanics, hydronamics, heat 
and electricity. 
2. Chemistry especially applied to agriculture and the other 
kindred industries. 
Biology, which is now an essential part of every successful 
farmer. The study of animal and insect life, how to care for, 
treat and judge the former and how to subdue and eradicate 
the latter. 
The industries should include for the girls: 
1. Domestic art, domestic science, household economics, 
chemistry of foods, canning, preserving of fruits and vege- 
tables, the study and care of poultry, testing of milk, making 
of butter, cheese, etc., the proper sanitation of the home, the 
eare of children, the nursing and treatment of the sick and the 
prevention of diseases. 
For the boys: 
The study and application of drainage. 
The testing of soils. 
Plant foods and how to supply them. 
Testing of seeds and their selection. 
5. The preparation of soils for crops, their cultivation, har- 
vesting and marketing. s 
6. The breeding of plants and animals. 
The principal laboratories will be the school farm, sufficient 
plots assigned to individual students to be worked in some 
particular crop, under proper guidance, and the results care- 
_fully tabulated and summarized. 
Orchards, which should be used for demonstration purposes. 
Manual training: in wood and iron applied to the need of the 
farm. Lastly these schools should be thoroughly standardized 
under the supervision of competent authority, free from poli- 
tics and local factions. They should be liberally provided for ier se Note

and held to a strict accountability. Much depends on the first 
attempts. Every failure will have the tendency to bring the 
cause into disrepute. 
We confidently believe that the school will soon be success- 
fully established and will play an important part in turning 
the tide of boys and girls from the town back to the home on 
the farm. 
It behooves the South to take steps now to hold our heritage. 
Much has already been lost, much yet remains.

THE APPLICATION OF ART TO TEACHING. 
E. L. HUGHES, SUPERINTENDENT GREENVILLE CITY SCHOOLS, 
Every one who teaches should be an artist. That is to say 
—should have command of skill in expression. We need not 
undervalue skill of expression in words. It is well to speak 
well. But the hand is the most expressive of all instruments 
and the eye the most receptive. Too much dependence has been 
placed upon oral expression; not enough value has been set 
upon manual expression. The tongue and the ear have been 
used too much; the eye and the hand not enough. There has 
been too much telling; not enough showing. 
Art is for use; not for ornament merely. The Beautiful is 
a “Servant in the House,” not an idle, pampered child. There 
is no more necessary thing to develop and use than artistic 
manual skill. It should be developed and used by the teacher 
in the schoolroom. It is not enough that the teacher should 
have a nimble tongue; a dextrous hand is no less needful. The 
average class in the modern schoolroom would be talked to 
death if the pupils did not, in self-defense, cultivate a protect- 
ive deafness. 
There is a marvelous present day development of the talk 
habit, and along with it and because of it, a marvelous disin- 
clination to hearken. One of the most appealing popular ex- 
pressions is: “Show me.” It means: “I don’t want to hear, 
I want to see.” 
Art has suffered at the hands of its friends. They have not 
insisted sufficiently on its serviceable qualities. The truest 
 
-P-A-G-E-175
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 175 
test of value is capacity for service. Art has been considered 
the servant of a chosen few; it should rightfully be considered 
the “servant of all.” 
Most teachers have little art of manual expression; some 
have a little more; a few have much. All might have much 
more. None use it in teaching as well as it might be used. 
The few who have most are inclined to use it least. To them 
it is “Art” and must not be degraded to common use. 
One teacher is a real artist; has had fine training; can do 
beautiful work; does it occasionally, as a sort of luxury. An- 
other has had no special training, but has developed some ar- 
tistic skill; has not sufficient to do such admirable work as is 
only to be admired; uses what she has daily and effectively. 
A third has no such skill; doesn’t try to acquire it; regards it 
as such a fine thing that only artists may use it. The second 
has the true idea of the best quality of Art—its usefulness. 
There is no notion so paralyzing as that which makes one 
hold his hands because they lack skill, so preventive of effective 
work as not working because results are less than perfect. 
There is no failure so lacking in all the elements of success as 
the failure of not trying that which is worth while. 
Three questions arise. First: What kind of manual art 
may the teacher use to the best advantage in teaching? Sec- 
ond: How may it be used and for what? Third: What meth- 
ods and means make it available? The answer to the first is: 
The art based upon ordinary drawing. To the second: By 
adaptation, for almost any subject which is to be taught. To 
the third. Well, that is another story, and demands showing 
rather than telling. _ 
The simple rudimentary drawing commonly taught in the or- 
dinary course of study may be developed by practice and intel- 
ligent application into a wonderfully effective help in teach- 
ing. The common opinion that an ordinary person cannot ac- 
quire skill in drawing—that some unusual and mysterious 
quality called talent is required, is a mistaken one. Learning 
to write a good hand is harder than learning to draw. So is 
learning to spell and to read and to calculate. These things 
are considered essential and are studied hard and practiced 
diligently. If the same amount of study was given to drawing 
as to reading we should have more expert draughtsmen than
-P-A-G-E-176
  176 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
we have good readers, and in some cases more good would be 
dene. For drawing is the basis of making; and making is the 
essence of work; and good work is better than poor reading or 
poor or vicious matter. 
Adaptation is the secret of the effective use of art in teach- 
ing. The ordinary exercises used by the drawing teacher are 
used for the purpose of acquiring art. They embody rudimen- 
tary elements of expression. They are the alphabet of art. 
But the writer of a letter, or the author of a book, uses only the 
alphabet. The musical composer uses only the scale, and the 
painter of great pictures must make use of the original ele- 
ments used in the simple sketch. The elements of any art are 
susceptible of marvelous adaptation, variation and combina- 
tion. So a little skill in the rudiments and a little knowledge 
of the principles of the original, primeval visual language may 
be improved, developed and adapted to become the most effect- 
ive means of meeting the mind’s most insistent demand: 
“Show me.” And it may be used in connection with the teach- 
ing of any branch of knowledge which is objective enough to 
permit an appeal to the sense of sight. Master the mystery of 
the interest inspiring illusions and mind informing illumina- 
tions wrought by outline, form, light and shade, color, group- 
ing and perspective and one may multiply teaching power 
marvelously. 
Simple drawings, diagrams, outline, requiring little art or 
skill—a few strokes, a little shading, some color, natural 
grouping, slight attention to perspective will serve to reveal 
the thing or the fact more clearly than many words of descrip- 
tion and explanation. More elaborate representation will teach 
still more strikingly. The more art the better, provided it be 
applied art. 
Place ideas are especially susceptible of illustration. This is 
recognized by the lavishness of its use in geographies, his- 
tories, literature and current events. The chief features of 
locality are easily represented. It is easier to make an effect- 
ive picture of a mountain and a lake, than of a cat and a bowl 
of milk. Mass effects may be more easily produced than de- 
tails, In the use of art for teaching other things one cannot 
go into details. The simple, striking features of locality are 
 
-P-A-G-E-177
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 177 
sufficient. Hence the mulitiplication of maps and pictures in 
teaching the fundamental notion of place. 
The importance of location in the general scheme of knowl- 
edge getting has not been sufficiently emphasized. The phrase, 
“Up in the ar,” may be aptly applied to much of the teaching 
of those subjects even in which the place idea is essential and 
primary. Down in the earth is the other extreme to which 
much teaching goes—vagueness and obscurity. There is no 
clear vision at either extreme. To be effective one must keep 
on the earth, not under or above it. To fix the fact to its place 
is first-aid to indefiniteness. 
Indeed this applied art in teaching has the best and clearest 
answers to the search questions of the mind bent on knowing. 
How does the thing look? How is it made? How was the 
deed done? Who did it? Where was it? What is the place 
like? Art has an answer for each of these questions—the best 
answer, next to the real, by so much as eye impressions are 
clearer and more illuminating than any other sense im- 
pressions. 
But we should regard art applied to teaching as a servant, 
not as a master; as a means, not an end. We should be users 
not worshippers. And we should avoid unnecessary using, 
which is fatal to usefulness. 
Anything used too much or too constantly is soon worn out. 
It is well to be a master of language; it is ill to talk too much. 
Hearers grow weary. The eye wearies as well as the ear. Beat 
too persistently on any sensory nerve and it suffers itself into 
somnolence. Art illustration artfully applied is the ideal. 
“Art is long, but time is fleeting.” The time element must 
be considered. “If ’twere done when ’tis done, then ’twere well 
*twere done quickly.” The method and the means, the tools 
and materials, the illustrations themselves must aid to econo- 
mize time and effort. That is one of the missions of art. There 
is nothing more precious than time except energy. They two 
make life. Both art and science have for their chief purpose 
the promotion of life and its interests.

THE COACH AND INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS. 
PROF, J. C. GODBEY, CENTRAL COLLEGH, FAYETTE, MO. 
We are commercializing a phase of student life that should 
be kept secondary and employed only as an assistant and a 
stimulus to the larger growth of intellectual powers. Men eat 
that they may live; they exercise that they may eat success- 
fully and continue to think without hindrance. But we are 
forgetting this fact and substituting for it in our colleges that 
men think, eat and live that they may exercise and call it ath- 
letics. Because all men are part bruteand not all men are a part 
god, therefore all men can be reached by an appeal to the ani- 
mal in man. As a result there are more colleges and univer- 
sities in the South known by their athletic prowess than by 
their intellectual attainments. We are coming to recognize 
the fact that if a school would grow it must have more than 
average representatives to boot the pigskin in the fall and 
clout the horeshide in the spring; and however we may lament 
the tendency we sooth our consciences and beguile the husky 
lads from the rural districts into coming to our school because 
we, perchance, see in him good guard or tackle timber. We 
even take out little axes and go among the academies, which 
are feeders for our colleges and universities, and mark the de- 
sirable saplings which have good looking limbs and likely 
trunks. And in time they go up to the university, seldom un- 
derstanding just why. Few institutions of any size or promi- 
nence in the country are without men to look after the train- 
ing of the various teams. These men are selected with greater 
care than the heads of the various departments and are often 
paid a larger salary. They give their time and talent to the 
work and the college is placed upon the map, so to speak, be- 
cause its athletic teams are successful. Students are drawn to 
the school, it becomes prosperous and the coach loses his job 
because he is outgrown in the rapid growth of football. A sur- 
prisingly large number of our finest specimens of manhood go 
to certain of our universities in order that they may play on 
good teams, win public favor and finally secure a good job as 
coach in a smaller school. While the ambition may not be an  
-P-A-G-E-179

unworthy one, it is most conservative, to say the least. Many 
schools that had no coach a few years ago, at the present time 
are forced to secure one to keep in line. These are being paid, 
from $1,000 to $4,000 a year for their services. As a result the 
real teaching force is curtailed in salary or cut down in num- 
bers, the coaching department is made prominent so that it 
will prove a paying investment, and the students get thwarted 
ideas of the college. It was recently said of a certain South- 
ern coach at a State university that he was worth more to that 
State than a new State capitol, and undue measures have been 
resorted to in order that the coach may be retained. It was 
even whispered that a certain large institution was feeling in- 
ternal discord and strife because the coach was not equal to 
the situation, and the team was a losing one. 
REMEDIES. 
The suggestions of a remedy may come under two heads: 
First, make the coaching a part of the responsibility of the col- 
legiate teacher ; and, second, raise the ideals of the coach. The 3 
movement which is rapidly gaining headway in the Missouri 
Valley is to make the coach a member of the teaching staff of 
the college and to exact of him the same high standards of 
morality and school government that are demanded from the 
teachers of science, literature or language. Coaching would | 
then become a side issue with the teacher, for his responsi- 
bilities would be first in the class room, then on the athletic | 
field. This would also tend to eliminate professionalism from 
coaching and would demand a well rounded man, rather than 
one of mere physical ability. 
Boys of today, as of yesterday and of 2,000 years ago, are 
prone to worship physical prowess. We love sturdy manhood 
and muscular achievement now as among the early Greeks. : 
There are heroes and hero worshipers at the present time as 
well as during the life of Carlisle; and no man can get closer 
to the throb of the college heart or feel more surely the pulse of 
college life than can the coach. When college presidents are 
gone and Greek and Latin professors have passed away the 
coach and the athletic record remain deeply carved on the es- 
cutcheon of college memories. Honesty, integrity and fair- 
midedness are the heritage of the coach to his team; or under-   
   
-P-A-G-E-180
  180 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
handedness, trickery and deceit leave a deep and lasting scar. 
A school may have a reputation for unfairness which, when in- 
vestigated, may be traced to the policy of the coach; another 
may win fame by a great team of professionals playing as ama- 
teurs—the coach is trying for a reputation and preferment. 
While at a certain institution not long since I sat in the lobby 
of a hotel and heard a coach tell leud stories to his team, use 
profanity and smoke cigarettes before them. My curiosity was 
aroused, and upon further investigation I found that practi- 
cally the whole of the team used profanity freely, and smoked 
when not in sight of the coach. And this rule is too prevalent; 
as the coach is, so the team is. 
There is never a moral requisite placed upon the coach. We 
do not look among his recommendations for one on church 
preferences or general devoutness. In fact, it is rather ex- 
pected of him that he be a little lax in morals and somewhat 
indifferent to the needs of the human soul. His business is to 
put out a winning team and then if he breaks training at a 
rather rapid pace when the season closes we shut our eyes and 
condone the fault. What we must strive unto is the elevation 
of the standard and the placing of greater responsibilities upon 
the one who is to do the coaching. The foundation and the 
superstructure must be of equal construction, and only master 
workmen can build aright so that both will stand. That the 
coach is a deciding factor in intercollegiate athletics cannot 
be gainsaid. That the tendency is to make him more so is ap- 
parent. The situation is most pertinent and needs our best 
thought and wisest action. We can allow the student to 
idolize the coach and belittle the teacher of Latin and Greek! 
We can make intercollegiate athletics the chief aim; or we can 
use it only as a means of broadening the lives of students by 
intercollegiate contests. My plea is not to remove the 
strenuousness of the contests, nor the pride in the success of 
one’s college. But let the same strenuousness be encouraged in 
the class room, and the regulations such that it will be im- 
perative in order to attain unto a place as an intercollegiate 
representatve. Let the coach be a faculty member and let his 
coaching be prompted by right motives and not the character- 
istic work of a professional athlete. Unless we do these things 
we will find ourselves standing upon a wild sea bank, a willow

in our hand, and, like Dido of old, sighing our souls away for 
the lost love of our departed ideals and the shattered hopes of

THE CONTENT OF A PRACTICAL COURSE IN BOTANY. 
FRANCIS ERNEST LLOYD, PROFESSOR OF BOTANY, ALABAMA POLY- 
TECHNIC INSTITUTE, AUBURN, ALA. 
Tue growing demand for increasingly practical education en- 
forces the necessity of determining what botany is of most 
worth in education in order to permit the elimination of the 
relatively unimportant. It is contended that, in endeavoring 
to meet this demand, the higher ideals of education, above those 
of immediate practicality, need not be sacrificed. The content 
of science courses need revision, further, because of the criti- 
cism that the results heretofore attained are lacking in devel- 
oping that which alone justifies science in education, the appre- 
ciation of the method of science. 
The present condition of the teaching of botany enforces the 
criticism that much of the content has a place as the result of 
inertia represented by formalism in the attitude toward the 
printed book and to the sacrosanct past. We need to break 
with these and decide independently of them upon the real 
values of the various parts of botanical study relatively to 
each other, judged by some standard such as usefulness in the 
field of study itself, the importance to pure science or to prac- 
tical affairs of the discoveries in them, or in the present and 
future demand for knowledge as regards kind. 
Judging by these criteria, it is argued that the part of the 
science which has to do with activity of the plant is of major 
importance. That which has to do with the description of the 
form and structure of plants is of relative unimportance. It 
affords some of the tools of operation, but leads to little or no 
knowledge of casual relations. That which has to do with 
change in the plant, and therefore with the plant as a living 
thing, namely, physiology, is fundamental. 
Certain modern educational movements, as well as activity 
within the science itself, enforce the recognition of this distine- 
tion, and give to the physiological aspect of botany its true 
 
-P-A-G-E-182
ee eer: 
182 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
place. School gardening, agricultural botany, etc., must take 
into account the living plant. The great discoveries are being 
made in the field of plant physiology, in the broad sense. 
The growing demands are for persons having a knowledge 
of botany in the field of research, pure and applied; in agricul- 
ture, hoticulture, pathology, bacteriology, forestry, plantation 
management (tropical fruits, rubber, sugar and the like) —that 
is, in human operations throughout the whole field of botany 
related to plant physiology chiefly. 
Teaching must meet this demand, but it is argued that this 
does not involve the sacrifice of that which is, from the broad 
educational point of view, the best of the science. 
The course in botany should, therefore, be chiefly experi- 
mental. Experiments may be very simple or very complex and 
refined, and may be arranged to meet the demands of all grades 
of pupils. Simple experiments are better than simple words 
in education; simple thinking is better than the memorizing 
of simple matters. The method of the science is of greater 
importance than the form, and is adaptable to all grades. 
Botany may, and must, take its responsibility in elementary 
and secondary by a revision of the content of its courses. By 
becoming physiological chiefly it will align itself with nature 
study and elementary agriculture, and thus save itself to edu- 
cation. :

THE DUTY OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY TO THE 
RURAL SCHOOL. 
A. S. BLANKENSHIP, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN. 
Tue people believe in education for the masses, and have 
made an investment with the intention of securing the condi- 
tions for popular education. The State University and the 
rural school are each a part of this investment. 
The free school system is still so new that the State univer- 
sity is practically without traditions. While created to render 
a broader service than that of the old university, it is in no 
way released from the special uses and duties of the older 
institution. The State university must accept the double re- 
sponsibility of maintaining the standards of the traditional 
 
-P-A-G-E-183
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 183 
university and of extending the opportunities for education to 
the masses. Naturally, it has done this in the order mentioned ; 
standards first, the popularization of education second. And 
just as naturally the new university without traditions adopted 
those of the older university from which it received both in- 
structors and standards. Now the traditional university con- 
cerned itself solely with higher education. Owing to heredity, 
therefore, the State university has been somewhat slow to see 
its duty to and its opportunity in the field of popular education. 
In the rural schools there is everywhere a need for stand- 
ards. The general incompetence of the rural teacher is noto- 
rious. He is unprepared in scholarship, and he is without pro- 
fessional training. Worst of all, he is isolated from the best 
spirits of his profession. The country physician has attended 
the medical college, and has there come in contact with the 
great ideals of his profession. The country lawyer lives in the 
city and is brought into daily contact with the progress of his 
profession. But the rural teacher has neither sat at the feet 
of an equipped teacher in school nor met him in his work. The 
physician and the lawyer have, by their work, led the people 
to faith. The country teacher, isolated and unsupported, has 
had no chance to perform work worthy of faith. Clearly, there 
is great need that he be brought into touch with the ideals of 
the teaching profession, especially as they apply to his own 
problems. ‘ 
But the best intellect of the teaching profession has not in 
the past been addressed to the problems of the rural teacher. 
There is, then, a need for investigation in the field of rural 
sociology. This work cannot be expected of the rural teacher. 
Nothing more than aid in the application of scientific principles 
can be expected of him. There must be competent, scientific 
investigation of the rural school problems. The results of this 
investigation must be carried to the rural teacher and to the 
rural school. 
On no institution does the responsibility to establish stand- 
ards, and to direct the application of established standards 
in the rural schools, rest so heavily as upon the State univer- 
sity. The teacher naturally looks for leadership to the head 
of the free school system. The various departments of the uni- 
versity are equipped with men who have the time, the scholar-

ship, the training and the ability to attack the special problems 
of the rural school-teacher. If the problem is the selection of 
a library, the school of English or the library force can prepare 
a list of books to meet the special needs. If it is a question of 
beautified school grounds, the school of botany can issue a bul- 
letin dealing with the subject as it applies to the various parts 
of the State. If it is the problem of hygienic school buildings, 
the Department of Architecture with the Department of Edu- 
cation can issue plans and specifications. In the Department 
of Education are always graduate students with experience in 
rural teaching and rural life who are ready to take up the sci- 
entific study of the rural school under the direction of educa- 
tional experts. In the general library are professional books 
that can be loaned to nonresident teachers whose work is in 
the rural school. 
The Department of Extension of the University of Texas has 
recently put into the field a lecturer on rural schools. During 
the summer he visited as many as possible of the summer nor- 
mals of the State. In this way he addressed about four thou- 
sand of the ten thousand teachers who attended these normals. 
He talked of the plans of the Department of Extension, of the 
special problems of the rural school as they apply to the exten- 
sion work, and of the bulletins issued by the University of 
Texas that aim at a solution of these problems. It is impos- 
sible for one lecturer, or even ten lecturers, to go personally 
to all the teachers of so large a State as Texas, but there are 
many ways in which the work may be handed from one indi- 
vidual to another. The Department of Extension, a few months 
ago, made the proposition to loan, free of charge, lantern slides 
for lectures on such subjects as “School Hygiene and School 
Building,” “Art in Home and School,” “Conservation,” and 
“Country Life Beautiful,” to all County Superintendents who 
would secure lanterns at local or personal expense. Ten 
County Superintendents at once took advantage of the offer. 
Many others in the future will do likewise. One of the most 
promising features of the work of carrying the university to 
the people is the rapidity with which a work well done in one 
locality is transmitted to other localities, and to other people. 
The Department of Extension bases its hope not so much upon 
what it may do in certain instances for the people as upon what 
it may lead the people to do for themselves.

Finally, the proposition is this: The State University, sup- 
ported by all the people, owes service to all the people. The 
majority of the population is rural. The country teacher, iso- 
lated, unappreciated and underpaid, is in special need of the 
university. He cannot go to the university. The traveling 
lecturer, with personal visits, with bulletins, and with travel- 
ing exhibits, must carry the best that the world has to offer in 
ideals, and the best experiences of the world’s workers to him, 
and through him to all the people. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CURRICULUM, PRO 
AND CON. 
AUGUSTINE AURIANNE, NEW ORLEANS, LA. 
ALL errors in school work may be broadly attributable to 
one of three causes: Ignorance of child nature, ignorance of 
the essence of the various forms of knowledge, and an inability 
to articulate these—that is, to apply knowledge to the growing 
needs of the child. The first of these leads to the various forms 
of abuses against which a righteous pedagogy has clamored, as 
expecting continuous attention of the young child through a 
prolonged period, requiring evidences of interest in the abstract 
presentation of facts, suppression of impulses toward expres- 
sion, and innumerable others; the second is responsible for er- 
rors in the method of instruction and the outline of work for 
the grades; the third accounts for misdirection of the child’s 
energy, dissipation of his power, and the consequent inadequate- 
ness of results. These errors, typical of the sphere of labor 
under discussion and partly growing out of the materials with 
which that labor is accomplished, vitiate not only teaching it- 
self, but everything in which knowledge is manipulated and 
the general facts of child life applied. I have reference to the 
course of study for elementary schools, or the elementary school 
curriculum. 
Examination of State and city courses of study has revealed 
several characteristics unfavorable to the attainment of the 
best practical results in teaching. In courses that are otherwise

good, instances of overcrowding, due to an unequal division of 
the subject-matter among the grades to which the work is as- 
signed, occur very frequently. In one instance prominently be- 
fore my mind, the study of history is begun in story form in 
the first grade, and presented formally in the sixth and sev- 
enth, in the latter of which the assignment covers topics deal- 
ing with the minutiae of United States History covering the 
formative and national periods. The fault here grows out of 
the excessive prolongation of the story work, coupled with an 
ambition to cover the whole field in the limited time afforded 
by two years. 
Less noticeable, because less frequent, are instances where 
the amount of work prescribed is insufficient to keep the chil- 
dren profitably employed during the term. The situation so 
created makes a draft on the resources of the teacher which 
may, or may not, be met. If it is, the situation is retrieved, the 
teacher improved in power, and the child saved; if not, the 
opportunity so created is devoted to activity more or less harm- 
ful to the best interests of the child. 
Aside from these considerations, the course of study is not 
always an efficient tool in the hands of the teacher because of 
its very form. The desire to supplement the work of normal 
schools with suggestion in methods, which, of itself, is an ad- 
verse criticism on the preparation of the teacher and the prac- 
ticability of here including other useful information, has over- 
come any ambition to confine the presentation of facts to those 
legitimately involved in a course of study. In consequence, 
where suggestions, directions, methods and illustrations are co- 
pious, the necessary facts are so submerged as to be practically 
inaccessible in the hour of need. This must not be understood 
as contending against an inclusion of necessary and useful data, 
but rather as directed against making that which is subordinate 
and suggestive, codrdinate with the main facts and equally 
prominent with them. This opinion seems reasonable in view 
of the fact that the average tenure of position is four years—a 
circumstance which should make school authorities especially 
desirous of surrounding the young and inexperienced teacher 
with conditions that induce success. If the isolation of school 
buildings makes the summoning of teachers for instruction in- 
expedient, include all necessary information in the course of 
   
-P-A-G-E-187

study, but make the distinctness of this unmistakable—let the 
outline of work stand out boldly and clearly, no matter how 
complex the setting conditions may require. 
From another standpoint, the form of the course of study is 
subversive of the best interests of the school. Where all the 
work of one grade is given, branch by branch, and the ease of 
the teacher in familiarizing herself with the work of her grade, 
insured, the result attained is at the expense of what is also 
important—acquaintance with the work in one subject as a 
whole. This sequence in the outline of work tends to bring 
isolation to the smallest unit of organization—the grade—a 
result which is prejudicial to the unification of the child’s per- 
sonality, and which, by suggesting the disconnectedness of school 
work, develops in the child a mental attitude against which 
the teacher who tries to present facts in their relations can 
make slow headway. 
Some courses of study are provided with a complex index in 
front, others with special ones for each grade, or each subject 
through all the grades, while, in others, the mechanism is so ob- 
scured that no particular basis for arrangement can be discov- 
ered. 
In an ideal arrangement of the course of study, the work 
would be given by subjects in alphabetical order, the work of 
the grades in any one subject would follow regularly, the out- 
line clearly separated from directions, suggestions and typical 
lessons. Reference to any particular part of the course could be 
made easy by having the subject and grade painted at the top 
of each page, and the special aim of the year’s work made un- 
mistakable by prefacing the details with a list of the leading 
topics. 
The sequence of work on the whole is good, because largely 
determined by the relations of facts themselves. Where the 
subject depends upon external conditions for its materials, the 
order is determined by the movement of the seasons, and it 
matters very little what topics are selected providing they deal 
with things and phenomena accessible to the observation of the 
child, and which, by reason of their inner constitution, appeal 
to him in the successive stages of development. And in the 
various branches of expression, where the effort is to have the 
child express his inner states in tangible form, the order of
-P-A-G-E-188
188 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
work is determined directly by the order of facts to be ex- 
pressed, or by a gradation of difficulty in a scheme leading to 
mechanical skill. Only here and there in the smaller minutiae 
of school work differences of order are observable, each of which 
migth be defended. 
On the side of definiteness, one might say that the tendency 
is exaggerated, though, to my mind, in the still unideal state of 
the teacher’s preparation this errs on the right side. As the 
average teacher reflects the quality of the text in her teaching, 
so does she, in a measure, reflect that of the course of study. 
Those courses, one might say, are most suggestive which suggest 
least, because their very silence on important points suggests 
error by leaving too much to an untrained initiative. To say 
that a course of study may be too definite is to reveal a wrong 
point of view because definiteness and opportunity to exercise 
originality are not mutually exclusive, and even in the most 
definite of courses there are innumerable opportunities for the 
teacher to exercise judgment in connection with the sequence 
of topics, selection of illustrations, correlation and points of 
emphasis. 
The course of study gives evidence of the failure of the school 
system to assimilate and articulate the various educational the- 
ories advanced within recent years. For this reason it has not 
yet attained the dignity of organism. The rapid enlargement 
of the course of study made it impossible for each of the new 
students to find its proper place, in consequence of which the 
schools labored under a vast and disorderly agglomeration of 
material from which the timely introduction and discharge of 
subjects, and correlation, are just beginning to deliver us. But 
the ambitious reach of the educational situation is not to be 
deplored, for it presages the happy time when the enrichment 
of the school curriculum through organization rather than accre- 
tion will become an accomplished fact. 
Radically changed as the school course is, here and there we 
find the finger marks of the old education still imprinted. With 
a wealth of literature within reach, it is surprising that there 
are school authorities who can pin their ambitions to single 
readers in the grades, or who are so oblivious of the special 
function of spelling as to find satisfaction in the special list 
of words in a speller. However, this must not be understood
-P-A-G-E-189
JOURNAL OF PROOEEDINGS. 189 
as directed against the use of readers and speller, but rather as 
advocating a broader and more adequate basis for this work. It 
is no extenuation of the incorrect point of view here involved 
to say that there is no obligation resting upon the teacher to 
confine herself to these limits, because it leaves too important 
an end to the exigency of the hour. Here and there one comes 
in contact with an over-emphasis of the value of parsing, which 
is a means to an end rather than an end itself. The serious 
thing about this over-emphasis is that it is accomplished at the 
expense of what is far more important—practice in the use of 
language and acquaintance with the masterpieces of literature. 
The worship of form traditionally survives in the introduction 
of the study of diacritical marks long before there is any need 
for using the dictionary. Happily, a growing consciousness of 
the requirements of the new education is making these instances 
fewer every day. 
Over against these unfavorable aspects of the school course 
stand the many indications of a sound and encouraging prog- 
ress. To the layman occupied in the narrow pursuits of his 
occupation, no less than to the teacher himself, the strides 
towards an education based on a sane and wholesome philosophy 
are a matter of wonder and encouragement. The restricted, 
conventional and altogether lifeless character of the old educa- 
tion is not a matter of remote tradition, but a vivid memory of 
a recent experience. Who of us that have labored over inferior 
and dry-as-dust texts, and sat out recitations unillumined by 
any of the rich and soul-stirring materials of history, literature 
and art, and devoted an unsuspecting childhood to the pursuit 
of symbols when just a little beyond lay a feast upon which the 
hungry soul might feed and grow strong, would not wish to 
relieve our school experiences under the new conditions? Yes, 
even the casual student of pedagogical progress is aware of the 
radical change in the direction and content of education, and 
appreciates the effort of the school to involve the whole child— 
his impressional, as well as expressional, nature. The course 
of study reveals an ambition to have the child duplicate the 
experiences of the best type of human being produced in the 
various fields of labor, through the works executed by these, to 
acquire a valuable mental content by incorporating into his 
consciousness those thoughts which, by nature of their sub- 
 
-P-A-G-E-190

stance and form, have endured through time, and to put him in 
possession of the various keys to knowledge by acquainting him 
with the different systems of symbols devised by the race for 
purposes of easy communication—the acquirement of these se- 
cured through use of valuable and interesting material as far 
as possible, and above all, to put him in possession of himself 
through the development of his many-sided nature, making 
knowledge of himself and his experience more highly conscious, 
and rendering adjustment of the physical, mental and moral 
nature as perfect as conditions permit. 
In and through the courses examined are many evidences 
of.a sounder psychological basis than that on which education 
has heretofore rested. The child is no longer looked upon as a 
receptacle to be filled, nor as an entity to be suppressed, but 
rather as a human being with possibilities of development 
toward, or away from, the ideal. Through his interests and 
spontaneous activities we are discovering the road to his real 
self, and by fostering right tendencies, are aiding nature in the 
unfolding of his personality. 
And not only is education constructive in this particular, 
but also in endeavoring to set up worthy aims as goals, and by 
appealing to the higher and finer feelings, raise him to higher 
planes of life. We have passed through the stage where the 
interests of the child were not only disregarded but looked upon 
with suspicion and distrust, through the stage where, by arti- 
ficial devices, he was weaned from activity vital to his progress, 
to the stage where the material presented speaks for itself. To- 
day we look askance at any one who speaks of making work 
interesting, and advocate a use of devices only when these, by 
changing the form of the abstract, makes adjustment to facts 
more economical. The energy of the child is also conserved and 
vitalized by avoidance of needless repetition and by efforts to 
put facts in right relation; in this way a reconciliation of edu- 
cational ambition and the limitations of time and strength are 
effected. Organization of knowledge is thus encouraged through 
a system of codrdination and subordination, or correlation of 
ideas, and knowledge thus rendered more available. Independ- 
ent mental effort is encouraged and the joys of self-activity fos- 
tered by use of a sound psychological procedure, and the child 
habituated to an orderly and systematic method of attack. Nur-

tured in an improved pedagogical atmosphere, the young 
teacher comes to her task with some power to distinguish be- 
tween facts which must be told and those which should be 
developed, and if she does not, the course of study in many 
cases serves as a reliable guide. 
Unmistakably reflected in the modern course of study is the 
widespread dissemination of literature on child nature. No 
longer do we find here crystallized the false doctrine that the 
child is a grown person in miniature, and hence, must be given 
the same work in smaller portions, nor do we find a hard and 
fast regime which overlooks the favorable and the unfavorable 
accidents of child nature. On the other hand, we find an intel- 
ligent attempt to fit the school to the child in his individual 
and social needs, and a conscientious effort to so regulate the 
machinery of the school as best to conserve the energy of the 
child. 
The use of types not only in the presentation but the illus- 
tration of facts is also a psychological tendency in the right 
direction. These offer convenient centers around which to group 
facts, and, by their very compactness, render needless the in- 
definite multiplication of instances. They are the high peaks 
which distinguish the different elevations in the range of knowl- 
edge, and when clearly presented serve in that no less useful 
aim of education—the keeping facts that are different, distinct. 
In this respect, the course of study is, on the whole, very help- 
ful. Here by suggesting the types, the deficiencies in the par- 
tial education of teachers are overcome; for ability to select all 
the different types in a field of knowledge presupposes intimate 
acquaintance with the knowledge and a mind more than ordi- 
narily discriminating. The value of this work does not wholly 
lie in the organization of ideas effected through it nor the 
implied distinction of facts, but also in the mental habits so 
induced. The concepts of the child on coming to school are 
meager, weighted with nonessentials, or positively wrong. It is 
the business of the school to enrich, purge, and correct these, 
and, in no instances, to contribute others of the same kind. 
Concomitant with this tendency toward the use of type forms 
has come an improvement in the method of assigning work; 
the course of study, in most cases, taking an unmistakable 
stand against assignment by pages. 
   
-P-A-G-E-192

On the side of morals, we find an increasing appreciation of 
the fact that the will depends upon knowledge for its content— 
that we can only expect right action when a right end is set 
up and right means for attainment adopted. The course of 
study points to literature, history and biography for the mate- 
rial through which right moral attitudes will be established 
and right action insured. It was very gratifying to see that in 
several courses of study definite programmes of work leading to 
the establishment of good moral habits were definitely outlined. 
Recognition of the fact that the ethical is practical is forcing 
itself upon the consciousness of teachers and school authorities 
alike. 
The course of study aims to unify the educational standards 
of a State—a desiable end where such unification brings about 
elevation. It is also directed toward the standards of the 
teacher, thus protecting the child from the overzealous and the 
careless teacher alike, and, by laying out the large requirements, 
puts the system of grading at the service of the child. It is 
made more or less effective according as the effort of the writer 
is guided and illumined by a sense of the knowledge of the 
child for whom the work is intended. Where he misses the 
essence of the work, we find the content does not subserve the 
best purposes of development and enrichment. A clear and def- 
inite statement indicating the knowledge and power the child 
should acquire as a result of the year’s work always helps to 
create favorable conditions, insuring pointedness and connected- 
ness of effort on the part of the child and affording safe anchor- 
age for the complex activities which might otherwise drift aim- 
lessly about. 
Such a course would presuppose ideally trained teachers, 
and which, by presenting the best in pedagogical thought and 
setting before the teacher attainable ends, would furnish stim- 
ulus to effort. It is to be hoped that this condition will be 
realized; perhaps at the instance of the State, which, in the 
interests of improved social leadership, will keep a little in 
advance of actual conditions, and through the delegation of 
authority to those at the helm of educational work, will not 
only encourage progress, but impose it upon city and country 
alike. 
No sane student will gainsay our claim that the school should
-P-A-G-E-193
    JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 193 
be in close touch with life—should form a continuous stream 
with life experiences. It is only since the world has looked back 
to the school and discovered the gap yawning between, and in 
its frankness has clamored against the untrained recruits 
thrown upon its mercy, that the school has grown reflective and 
more conscientious in its responsibility. As first comes before 
last, so must it fall to the lot of the schools to establish and 
develop those activities that give content to human experience— 
that the future needs of the child and his environment may be 
met. At present the school is groping in semidarkness hin- 
dered by the retarding influence of conservative ideas, by the 
fixed objects to which the resources are applied, by the pressure 
of the lack of training of the teachers, etc. It is a long way to 
the culmination, but the time is surely coming when the course 
will flow into four channels toward four different ends—prepa- 
ration for the home, the trades, commercial life and the pro- 
fessions. These four ends, the accomplishment of which will 
begin about the sixth year, will rest on a general education, and 
differ chiefly in the point of emphasis because of the different 
ends to be attained, but which, by virtue of the child’s individ- 
uality as well as his function in society, will aim to make of 
body and mind efficient instruments of work, and, by filling his 
life with a rich and powerful content, put his will into the serv- 
ice of worthy work. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
THE GEOGRAPHICAL ELEMENT IN THE TEACHING 
OF HISTORY. 
DR. JAMES ELLIOTT WALMSLEY, PROFESSOR OF HISTORY IN MILL- 
SAPS COLLEGE. 
Tue distinctive danger which teachers of history must face 
is either that of losing themselves in a wild waste of facts 
without any adequate way of escape for guide or pupil, or else 
that of becoming chained to one method of historical interpre- 
tation to such a degree that the only just characterization of 
the teacher is a “crank.” For a long time there was no theory 
of history, no idea of historical causation. History was written 
and taught as if a mere knowledge of facts with appended dates 
was all that could be derived from the dismal science.

Gradually there arose a feeling that there must be some 
golden thread of plan or design running through the confused 
mass of facts, and there came as a first explanation “the great 
man theory,” or the biographical method of explaining history. 
The idea that history is the sum of the lives of its great men, 
that by a constant study of biographies one could know history, 
has had many famous advocates, but it is not a theory that can 
stand the test of reason. At the same time the teachers of his- 
tory from the grammar school up to the university must give 
due weight to the influence of a great man at a critical point in 
world development. 
Another theory that has had its supporters is the religious 
theory, and in this there is so much of truth that no writer or 
teacher of history can afford to neglect the profound influence 
of Mohammedan enthusiasm, of stoic self-sufficiency, or of He- 
brew monotheism, on the development of types of character. 
But as a complete explanation of historical causation it is fun- 
damentally defective in that it overlooks the possibility of re- 
garding religion as a result rather than as a cause. 
One of the best methods of interpretation is the political 
method, admirably summed up in the phrase, “History is past 
politics, and politics is future history.” Nearly all the histo- 
- Ties written today are on this fundamental basis, and probably 
nine-tenths of our high school teaching, and I fear, from what 
investigation I have been able to make, three-fourths of our 
college teaching is of this nature. Much is said by these theo- 
rists of the natural progress of the world from monarchy to 
democracy and of the dwindling of absolutism before the ad- 
vance of freedom. But this again has involved the old fault. of 
considering politics as primary instead of secondary, and of 
calling that a universal cause which is, in fact, an effect. 
Thus we are gradually driven away from the ground that 
history is purely a psychical study, and are led to look at the 
physical side of the subject. This physical interpretation is 
associated with the name of Buckle. It is true that other 
writers as far back as the eighteenth century had suggested this 
phase of investigation. In a certain sense Montesquieu is the 
founder of the present school of historical study. Buckle says 
of him: “He knew what no historian before him had even sus- 
pected, that in the great march of human affairs, individual
-P-A-G-E-195
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 195 
peculiarities count for nothing. * * * He effected a com- 
plete separation between biography and history. * * * He 
was the first who called in the aid of physical knowledge in 
order to ascertain how the character of any given civilization 
is modified by the action of the external world.” 
In Mr. Buckle’s brilliant and justly famous second chapter 
of the History of Civilization in England, entitled, “The Influ- 
ence of Physical Laws,” he has analyzed the effect of climate, 
food, soil, and the general aspect of nature on developing man- 
kind, and, although for fifty years writers have been following 
in his steps, it is my candid opinion today that no man is com- 
petent to write or teach history who is not familiar with the 
line of thought therein developed. Let me also say that no 
man should attempt to teach who does not have easy access to 
Freeman’s Historical Geography of Europe (old but still excel- 
lent), Brigham’s Geographic Influences in American History, 
and Semple’s American History and Its Geographic Conditions. 
Following the course thus marked out there has grown up a 
school of historians who explain all historical facts as economic 
results, who, for instance, eliminating Lee and Lincoln, make 
the whole problem of the rise and fall of the Confederacy in our 
own country a footnote to an elaborate Economic Interpreta- 
tion of History. To mark out a path for the college teacher 
of history which will avoid the pitfalls on each side is the pur- 
pose of this brief study of the relative stress of the geographical 
element in all historical teaching. 
Obviously, college teaching is limited in methods as well as 
in degree by the preparation of students for entrance. 
Judging from what I find true in my own freshman classes, 
and from what my fellow teachers of history tell me, the stu- 
dents who come to college have merely the haziest ideas of geo- 
graphical relations. 
Occasionally, a geographical phrase will throw a flood of light 
on a subject, and will arouse a deep and continuing interest. 
A few years since while using Professor Cheney’s excellent Huro- 
pean Background of American History with a sophomore class, 
I quoted the sentence: “The discovery of a sea route to ‘the 
Indies advanced England from being the back door of civiliza- 
tion to the very forefront of the commercial struggle.” I found 
later that this one idea had meant more to the class than any 
other part of the course.
-P-A-G-E-196

Herbert Adams says that the great fact in history as well as 
in geography is that the world is round—that is, that you must 
recognize all facts as parts of a great whole. I have absolutely 
no patience with the idea that facts may be successfully taught 
by any other method than by relating them to other facts as 
cause or effect. The relative as well as the immediate influence 
of geographical conditions vary at different epochs. Broadly 
speaking, geography conditions history in three ways, as Profes- 
sor Hubbard has said: “The physical features, climate, mineral 
and agricultural resources, furnish one motive in all history; 
the topography, distribution of land and water, of plain and 
mountain, of valley and barrier, have been another, and the 
approachableness, proximity or isolation of nations, a third.” 
No teacher today omits to mention how the adaptability of 
the Southern soil for tobacco, cotton and rice necessitated large 
plantations, slavery, aristocratic social organization, and all 
that we call the “old South,” or how the sterile soil of New 
England was the foster mother of the small farm, the individ- 
ualistic democracy, the town meeting and the Yankee character. 
No teacher, I say, omits this, but few notice how the arid wastes 
of our own West, as well as the riverless sections of Australia, 
call for government aid and develop Socialism, or something 
akin. The same Englishman who is a radical individualist in the 
moist climate of England, becomes an equally radical advocate 
of government ownership in Australia or New Zealand. Carry- 
ing this same process a step further it was the discovery of min- 
eral wealth in our Southland that first brought forth the South- 
ern Yankee, and created the new South. 
Up to the present time nations have been largely concerned 
with military aggression and defense; in the future they will 
be interested in what makes for peace and commercial progress. 
The historian today must know trade routes and products, as 
he once knew campaigns and weapons. The barriers that are 
effective today in dividing nations are those that prevent the 
passage of goods, not armies. 
Admitting unreservedly the truth of all that has been said as 
to the effect of natural features on the development of man, we 
cannot teach a purely material interpretation of history. The 
one distinguishing difference between men and lower animals 
is that the environment molds the animal while man may mold

his environment. This determining human quality, however, 
comes only with advancing civilization, and even then it is im- 
possible to decide to what extent the man who is today changing 
the face of nature was himself changed yesterday by that same 
nature. There hangs in my lecture room a copy of Trumbull’s 
“Signing of the Declaration of Independence.” The men who 
stand around the table are ruddy, oval-faced, beef-eating Eng- 
lishmen, who would never be suspected of being Americans. 
An interesting exercise is to study the changing type of faces in 
an illustrated history of our own country, but we cannot say 
that it is climate alone that has produced the present-day Amer- 
ican. The blending of many strains of blood into our universal 
“melting pot” may be a major cause, or one of relatively small 
importance. But the teacher of history that is worth while 
must be alert to examine every theory that attempts to explain 
the psychical marvel of the American spirit. We may believe 
with Julian Hawthorne that the American colonists drew in 
large ideas of freedom with every breath of fresh air from our 
boundless expanses, or we may also believe that the rapid alter- 
nation of temperature extremes has produced the hurrying, 
rushing spirit of American business, and we may at least think 
over a recent theory that the “cold wave,” a peculiarly Ameri- 
can phenomenon, with its sharp contrasts of atmospheric pres- 
sure, and its dispelling of poisonous gases, has kept us keyed up 
to concert pitch; we may add to these many theories of our 
own, but we must admit that while this country of ours has 
made us what we are, we at the same time have made the coun- 
try. Only in our own time have the great Western deserts 
yielded to the control of man. A few years since it was a com- 
monplace of geographical teaching that no stable government 
could grow up in the fever-cursed regions of Panama and Cuba. 
Now Havana, the cleanest city in the West, quarantines against 
yellow fever in the United States, and Panama is an ideal health 
resort, free from mosquitoes and dirt. Rumelin says: “That 
eternally blue heaven which laughs above fonia has now for two 
centuries renounced those miraculous effects which it must have 
exerted once, and the havens and bays of the Phenician coast 
have almost as long been inviting commerce and navigation in 
vain.” 
No line of work calls for so broad an education or so bal-

anced a judgment as historical interpretation. Let us lay down 
as a rule for teaching that the establishment of colonies, the 
founding of cities, and the exploration of territories are condi- 
tioned by seacoasts, rivers and natural trade routes; the rival- 
ries of early countries, the wealth or poverty of primitive peo- 
ples, and the manner of life of growing nations, are the result 
of soil and climate; even the temperament of a people may be 
largely affected by the general aspect of their land, but let us 
at the same time teach that at the present day man changes 
his climates, creates his railroad routes, digs his water routes, 
fertilizes his rocky soil, irrigates his deserts, banishes his causes 
of disease, makes his own will dominant as he seizes his divine 
birthright. The history of the future is psychical.

THE NEED OF PRACTICAL AGRICULTURE IN THE 
COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL. 
T. J. HALE, PRINCIPAL PICKENS COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL, ALABAMA. 
Tux subject of agriculture is at present receiving much atten- 
tion as a scientific branch of study. The added impetus to sci- 
entific investigation is the result of necessary practical experi- 
mentations. As the annual yield on a given area of land de- 
creases, improved methods of farming must be introduced. 
Since the county high schools are primarily dependent on the 
rural population for their patronage, it is absolutely essential 
for the future prosperity of the schools that they conform as 
speedily as possible to the needs that the changed conditions 
make imperative. 
The major part of the high school curriculum is composed 
of cultural subjects. These are at variance with the practical 
life of the farmer. His experience has shown him that educa- 
tion that ranks high in cultural value only serves ultimately to 
increase the discontent with average agricultural conditions. 
It should be the aim of the schools to get the codperation of 
the entire county rather than be influenced by local partisans. 
This general harmony can only be obtained through the initia- 
tive of the schools. The farmer’s conservatism can be easily
-P-A-G-E-199
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 199 
overcome just so soon as the schools offer a part of their courses 
as a practical asset that will function later in some form of 
material gain. 
The codperation that is urged will, if obtained, function to 
the mutual advantage to both the schools and the farmers. By 
the procedure, the schools will gain that sympathy and coédpera- 
tion without which they cannot maintain their present status, 
and in return they will give to the farmer that cultural training 
without which he cannot develop into an efficient citizen. 
Owing to the flexibility of the high school course, practical 
agriculture may be introduced without omitting any of the im- 
portant cultural subjects. In any permanent educational 
scheme for the public good, the cultural and practical should 
supplement each other. The farmer has a perfect right to de- 
mand of the high school that its graduates be skilled in his occu- 
pation. The schools can, at the same time, by giving this guar- 
antee, enforce a curricula that will function in cosmopolitan 
ideals. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
THE PRESSURE CURVE IN VOLUNTARY CONTROL. 
JASPER C. BARNES, MARYVILLE COLLEGE, MARYVILLE, TENN. 
Tus paper reports the results of one series of an experimen 
tal investigation of voluntary isolation of control in a group, 
a preliminary account of which was read before the members 
of the society in 1909. In the series of tests reported in the 
former paper, the reagents frequently stated that they used pres- 
sure to inhibit the movement of the fingers. In order to obtain 
an objective record of the pressure of these fingers, to compare 
the relative value of the methods of relaxation and contraction, 
to show the relative amount of pressure used in inhibition dur- 
ing the learning process, the effect of rate on pressure, and the 
relation of rate to fatigue, three groups of six subjects each 
were selected. The apparatus described in the former paper 
did not register the pressure curve; so, at the suggestion of 
Professors Angell and Carr, we devised apparatus for that pur- 
pose. Plaster of Paris pistons (B, Fig. II), resting on coiled 
steel springs in glass tubes, contained pegs (A, Fig. II; B and
-P-A-G-E-200
200 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
C, Fig. I) for the support of the little and middle fingers. The 
pistons were made to work air-tight by the use of oil. The 
glass tubes were connected with two tambours by means of rub- 
ber tubing. The slightest pressure on the pegs pushed the pis- 
tons down and thus moved the recorders of the tambours. 
GROUP I. 
Three of the subjects, V, Sc and S, were instructed to relax 
their fingers, and the other three, O, G and M, to keep their 
fingers, rigid, the antagonistic muscles being kept tense. The 
subjects were instructed to move the tip of the ring finger, 
using the metacarpo-phalangeal joint as a pivot, through the 
space of two centimeters at the rate of two times per second 
for one hundred seconds. After resting for three minutes a 
second test was given. The amplitude was somewhat irregular 
because the subjects were not able to judge accurately the dis- 
tance. The subjects that relaxed gained control more rapidly 
than those that kept the fingers rigid; and they all gained con- 
trol more rapidly than the first group of subjects that were not 
instructed. 
During the first stages of the learning process the amount of 
pressure varied greatly during each test; the pressure curve 
showed sudden, sharp and irregular changes. But after the 
subjects learned to inhibit the movements of the little and mid- 
dle fingers, the pressure curve remained practically constant 
and the amount of pressure was very slight. Two of the sub- 
jects resorted to the expedient of pressing down the palm of the 
hand or the thumb in order to keep from pressing down on the 
pegs which supported the middle and little fingers. The pres- 
sure curve of the subjects that were instructed to relax was 
more regular and less in extent than the curve of those who 
were directed to keep their fingers rigid. 
The mental antecedents, or cues, that initiated the movement 
of the ring finger in each case were essentially the same as those 
reported in the previous series. G, M, O and Sc reported audi- 
tory cues. S usually had a visual image of the movement that 
he was going to make. V always had his ring finger innervated 
and the sound of the signal simply touched off the movement; 
his cue would thus seem to be kinesthetic, but it was difficult 
to distinguish between the kinesthetic image which doubtless

preceded the movement and the perception of the innervated 
finger. 
The mental processes that accompanied the movement of the 
ring finger varied. G repeated mentally “up, down,” which 
seemed to be his chief element of control. He was conscious of 
tactile sensations in the tip of the finger and sometimes re-
-P-A-G-E-202
  202 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
ported sensations of strain in the metacarpal region near the 
metacarpo-phalangeal joint, but as a rule the kinesthetic sen- 
sations did not rise above the threshold. His mental type is 
strongly auditory. G was instructed to hold his fingers rigid. 
His introspection runs thus: Auditory cue. Auditory image 
of the mental phrase “up, down,” and the rhythm of the same 
controlled the movement. Had tactile sensations in tip of ring 
finger, but they did not seem to be elements of the control 
process. Other fingers were rigid and the little finger was not 
in consciousness. Experienced tactile sensations in tip of mid- 
dle finger a few times during the test, but it was not in con- 
sciousness most of the time. 
O’s initial cue was usually auditory. Occasionally he re- 
ported that the signal merely touched off the innervated finger. 
His control of the movement of the ring finger was chiefly audi- 
tory—counting mentally. Tactile sensations in tip of finger 
and kinesthetic sensations in the first phalanx and in the 
metacarpo-phalangeal joint were elements of control. Some- 
times he reported sensations of fatigue and strain in the fore- 
arm. The inhibition of the other fingers was due to muscular 
tension and sensations of pressure on the tips of the fingers. 
The following is a type of his introspections, fingers rigid: 
Auditory cue. Auditory perception of the rhythm of the move- 
ment was the principal element of control, but was conscious 
of tactile sensations in tip of finger and kinesthetic sensations 
in the first phalanx of the ring finger near the metacarpo- 
phalangeal joint. Other fingers were controlled by muscular 
tension and by sense of pressure on the tips. 
M’s initial cue was auditory-visual; sometimes M reported 
the finger innervated ready for the movement and the signal 
simply touched it off. Perception of the rhythm of the move- 
ment was the principal element of control. ‘Vague articular 
sensations were localized in the first phalangeal joint of the ring 
finger. Other fingers were set and held rigid from the first. 
Tactile sensations were localized in their tips. M pressed down 
on the palm of the hand and braced the hand with the thumb 
and forefinger, in order to keep from pressing down on the pegs, 
and thus show a large pressure curve. M’s introspections run 
as follows: Auditory-visual cue. Perception of the rhythm 
and smoothness and ease of the movement seemed to be the

principal control process. Had vague articular sensations in 
the first phalangeal joint. Other fingers were set at the begin- 
ning of the test and were not in consciousness except occasion- 
ally when tactile sensations were felt in the tips. 
Visual image of the movement to be made was 8's initial cue. 
The movement of the ring finger was controlled by kinesthetic 
perception of it. Articular sensations were localized in the 
metacarpo-phalangeal joint and vague tactile sensations in the 
palm of the hand. S had a tendency to press down on the palm 
of the hand in order to reduce the extent of the pressure curve 
made by the middle and little fingers. S soon learned to relax 
the non-moving fingers and to let them drop out of conscious- 
ness. The following illustrates his introspections: Visual 
image of the movement to be made by the ring finger was the 
starting cue. Kinzsthetic perception of the ring finger seemed 
to control its movement. Articular sensations were localized 
in the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, and tactile sensations in the 
palm of the hand. Other fingers were relaxed and not in con- 
sciousness. Movement was practically automatic. 
Sc reported invariably the auditory cue. The movement was 
usually controlled either by auditory perception of the rhythm 
of the instrument or by auditory imagery of some kind or 
other. Kinesthtic sensations were localized in the metacarpo- 
phalangeal joint. Sensations of strain were localized in both 
the volar and dorsal side of the forearm. Sc reports as follows: 
Auditory cue. Movement of ring finger was controlled by the 
idea of the rhythm of a whistled tune; kinesthetic sensations 
in the metacarpo-phalangeal joint and in the forearm on both 
the dorsal and volar sides. Other fingers were let alone and 
were not in consciousness except once or twice. Noise outside 
caused attention to go to the little and middle fingers once 
or twice. 
V always innervated his finger ready for the signal which 
seemed to touch off the movement. Kinesthetic perception of 
the ring finger was the principal control process. Articular 
sensations were localized in the metacarpo-phalangeal joint and 
sensations of strain in the dorsal-metacarpal region. Occasion- 
ally V reported that visual perception controlled movement of 
finger. The other fingers were relaxed and usually not in con- 
sciousness. His report runs as follows: Finger was inner-

vated and signal set it off. Both kinesthetic and visual percep- 
tion of the ring finger controlled its movement. Kinzsthetic 
sensations were localized in the metacarpo-phalangeal joint, in 
metacarpal region and in the forearm. Other fingers were con- 
trolled by slight contraction of the antagonistic muscles. At- 
tention was on the ring finger. 
Fatigue usually began to appear at the end of eighty to one 
hundred seconds when the subjects were required to move at 
the rate of one hundred and twenty times per minute; and 
when they were required to move for a longer period at that 
rate the subjects could not inhibit the movement of the other 
fingers. When only three or four minutes intervened two tests, 
the inhibition of the little and middle fingers was not so good 
during the second trial as in the first on any given day. Articu- 
lar sensations were usually localized in or near the metacarpo- 
phalangeal joint, and as fatigue increased tendinous and mus- 
cular sensations were felt in the metacarpal and carpel regions 
and in some instances sensations of strain were experienced in 
the forearm. 
Automatism was acquired more rapidly by the subjects that 
were instructed than by those that were not instructed in the 
series described above. Twenty-five to thirty trials were re- 
quired to gain complete automatism. O and G, who were in- 
structed to hold their fingers rigid, required about twenty per 
cent more trials than the subjects that were instructed to re- 
lax. G was considerably older than the other subjects, and that 
was doubtless one reason why it took him longer to gain au- 
tomatism and probably the principal reason rather than the 
fact that he was instructed to hold his fingers rigid. 
O, Se and G had had no preliminary training in finger move- 
ments. M had taken twenty piano lessons when a little girl, 
but had practiced none since. Motor control was naturally 
easy for her. S used a typewriter occasionally, but had never 
taken general lessons. WV had never taken piano lessons, but 
amused himself occasionally by playing. 
GROUP II. 
The six subjects of this group began the tests with the fingers 
of the right hand and were instructed to relax and move at the 
rate of 132 per second. As fast as control was gained, the rate

was increased to a point where the subject could not inhibit 
the movement of the other fingers and practice was continued 
at the faster rate until control was gained. This process was 
continued until the subject gained control at the fastest rate 
possible, and then a rate faster than the subject could move and 
control the other fingers was required. 
When control was practically perfect with the right hand re- 
laxed, the subjects of Group II were given tests with the fingers 
of the left hand contracted. The rate was increased as stated
-P-A-G-E-206
  
  206 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
above. Comparison of these tests with Group II, using the 
right hand, fingers relaxed, is given below. 
Group II gained control with the fingers relaxed considerably 
faster than Group III, fingers contracted. This might seem to 
be due to the fact that Group II used the right hand, while 
Group III used the fingers of the left hand; but when the in- 
structions were reversed, the relaxed fingers gained control 
more quickly than those that were contracted. On the whole, 
our experiments seem to show that control is gained more 
quickly when the fingers are relaxed during the learning 
process. 
As shown in Group I, the pressure curve becomes smaller 
with practice, and is very small after the subject has gained 
control and moves at a moderate rate; and when perfect inhibi- 
tion is attained, the pressure curve becomes a straight line, 
showing a slight degree of pressure; but when the reagent is 
required to move fast enough to require effort, the pressure 
curve tends to increase in extent and to mark time with the 
moving finger.. When the inhibition is incomplete, pressure is 
always shown to be present in all normal tests. Three of our 
subjects, that were made “wise” as to the object of our tests, 
avoided pressure on the tips of the fingers by pressing down on 
the palm of the hand. 
The effect of rate on pressure was marked. When the subject 
first begins to learn the movement, pressure is shown at each 
movement by the inhibited fingers, but the irregularity of the 
pressure curve gradually disappears by practice at the slower 
rate. But by increasing the rate, the pressure curve rapidly 
increases, and tends to conform to the symmetry of the curve 
made by the moving finger. As the maximum rate is ap- 
proached the pressure curve suddenly increases in amplitude 
and conforms in time to that shown by the moving finger. 
When the rate is faster than the subject can move the ring 
finger and inhibit the movement of the other fingers, the pres- 
sure curve becomes irregular both in amplitude and rate. 
As the rate increases in an arithmetical ratio, fatigue in- 
creases in a geometrical ratio. When the subject was required 
to move at the fastest rate possible, extreme fatigue occurred at 
the end of fifty or sixty seconds, and the amplitude of the curve 
was greatly reduced and frequently the subject was compelled
-P-A-G-E-207
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 207 
to stop moving the finger because of fatigue. After a given rate 
becomes well automatized, movement may continue for a con- 
siderable time without fatigue. A rate that is easy for one 
subject may be utterly impossible for a subject of a different 
type. When the subjects were required to contract, fatigue 
was experienced more quickly than in the tests in which they 
were instructed to relax. In some instances the fatigue became 
so painful at the end of eighty or ninety seconds that the sub- 
ject was compelled to stop. As a rule, the amplitude of the 
curve shown by the moving finger was less during contraction 
than during relaxation, and the pressure curve was greater. 
GROUP III. 
Group III of the pressure curve series began with the fingers 
of the left hand contracted and with a rate of sixty per minute; 
the rate was gradually increased as soon as the subjects gained 
approximate control until a point was reached at which the sub- 
jects could go no faster and keep control of the non-moving 
fingers. 
Group III required approximately twenty per cent more time 
to gain automatism by the method of contraction with the left 
hand than Group II by the method of relaxation with the right 
hand. But when Group II used the fingers of the left hand 
contracted, and Group III the fingers of the right hand re- 
laxed, the former required twenty per cent more tests than the 
latter. All our tests seem to show that relaxation is the better 
method. In both cases, when change was made from right hand 
to left and from left to right and the method reversed, it re- 
quired approximately half as much time to gain control after 
the process had been learned by the fingers of the other hand. 
The effects of cross-education were thus apparent even though 
the method was reversed. 
The process of inhibition and control were essentially the 
same as those given in the former paper. The pressure curve 
showed sudden, sharp and irregular changes during the first 
stages of the learning process, but after inhibition was learned, 
the pressure curve remained practically constant and indicated 
a very small amount of pressure. The pressure curve of the 
subjects that were instructed to relax was more regular and 
less in extent than the curve of those instructed to contract.

During the learning process a definite visual, tactile, audi- 
tory, muscular, tendinous, or articular image of the proposed 
movement initiated. Frequently the image was of the mixed 
type. After automatism was gained, the signal alone was suf- 
ficient to touch off the innervated finger. When the hand is 
supported, pressure seems to be an important element of the 
process of inhibition during the learning process, but gradually 
decreases in intensity as automatism is approached. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
THE PROBLEM OF MORAL TRAINING IN AMERICAN 
EDUCATION. 
JOHN G. HARRISON, CHAIR OF PHILOSOPHY AND EDUCATION, MERCER 
UNIVERSITY, MACON, GA. 
A CAREFUL observer of American education does not see yet 
an agreement as to aim. The discussions still rage as to 
whether information of one kind or another, or development of 
the individual or of society, is the end. 
However, it is here contended that patient thinking can bring 
to light and keep clear an intelligible and practical ideal in 
which all the others may be harmonized and made inspiring. 
Meanwhile, modestly, but dogmatically, the speaker contends 
that, not only as the true one, but the one most commonly ac- 
cepted by our American people, the ideal is nothing less than 
the full and harmonious development of the individual life. 
The only real rival of this view is that education is for the 
sake of society. But this view leaves open the question what 
sort of society the future ought to have. In the child the de- 
velopment view finds the prophecy of the society not yet seen 
by man. 
Under every view of aim moral training is treated as im- 
portant. It is needed to illuminate science with regard for law 
and to train the athlete so that in moral matters he will “hit 
the line hard.” But under the idea of growth the moral ele- 
ment becomes greatly enhanced. The feeling for right is the 
master impulse in a many-sided system of interests. It is the 
sustaining motive for school and for life. It transforms the
-P-A-G-E-209
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 209 
organism from a moment in a process to a struggler whom we 
may truly call man. 
What is the content of the moral life? Without claiming 
them to be all, these elements are proposed as much of the 
actual stuff of morality: the life of habit, obedience to com- 
mands of proper authority as such, a later recognition and ac- 
ceptance of principles behind the commands, and a reverence 
for the largest environment in which the God of religion is con- 
sidered a cause and a companion. The unity of the organism 
and the laws of its development remind us too that these ele- 
ments are not to be separated from each other, but react each 
on all the others. The deepest thinking does not make morality 
individual, social, or religious, but regards it as consisting of 
all these factors. Our people believe in this comprehensive and 
earnest morality, and our problem is to promote it. 
Let us note some of the difficulties. First we have the home. 
Often there is no clear ideal for its issue or at best only a less 
important one in the mind of the parent. Feelings of personal 
insufficiency for the task or a jealous guarding of the child’s 
personal responsibility toward God often prevent parents from 
dealing actively with the moral center where religion dwells. 
A second difficulty is with the church. Under our system the 
division of labor has made the church responsible for the 
spiritual. Now with all regard for hard worked and faithful 
teachers and preachers, it can be truthfully said that the church 
has not taken hold promptly and vigorously of that work left 
almost entirely to it. Its ministry to children is far from ade- 
quate in character or amount. 
Our doctrine of separation of Church and State with all its 
blessings has given us a serious handicap. The school cannot 
be sectarian though it is commanded to be moral. To prevent 
sectarianism the Bible is practically excluded, and the moment 
instruction in morality touches religion a halt is called. 
On the other hand the progress of science, immediately, not 
ultimately, it is hoped, has biased many a teacher with the 
ethics and metaphysics of materialism. It is considered subver- 
sive of separation of Church and State to teach sectarian doc- 
trine in an Indian school of the West supported by the govern- 
ment. It is equally repugnant to freedom of conscience and a 
free religious life to teach science with a theory or attitude that 
14

  210 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
suggests that the world is only matter and whatever is is right, 
when the father who pays the taxes to support the school be- 
lieves that there is more of man than brain and a kingdom of 
God to come as well as a regin of law on hand. 
With no complaint at this condition and only asking what 
to do with it, we see that the danger is that in the division of 
labor some agency will do its work and the keystone of 
morality may never be put properly into the arch of character. 
The situation is hopeful, however, in that owing to the unity of 
the child any worker by effort in his field may touch the moral 
nature. What high results we might expect if all the workers 
would get and keep before their minds the moral ideal as the 
main thing! 
What now are our means for affecting the moral life? Let it 
be remembered that we can train only through the self-activity 
of the child. We must work for the child through him to make 
him free. To appeal to the self-activity we have the physical 
world challenging the child to its mastery, the material of his- 
tory to warn or inspire, the examples of life at hand provoking 
recoil or imitation. And as a final matter in fixing the bent of 
the life toward faith and righteousness or anarchy and doubt 
is serious reflection on the unseen causes and relations of the 
world appearing at noteworthy periods of the child’s life. 
The institutions responsible for this work of moral training 
are the home, the playground, the school, the church, the State, 
the social circle, the shop. Along with this corporate responsi- 
bility every individual in these institutions, parent, mate, teach- 
ers and life associate has a duty to our American youth. Omit- 
ting the others, I speak first of the church and home and then 
more fully of schools and teachers. 
The home needs the highest ideal for its issue. It should 
make actual use of advantages possessed by no other institu- 
tion, such as the power of personal example and a strongly or- 
ganized life. Every phase of moral life touched by other insti- 
tutions can also be promoted by the home. There should be a 
larger fitting of parents by a study of child nature and an ap- 
preciation of it to enable them best to perform the duty of moral 
training. 
The church must increase its workers and train them better. 
Ministers and teachers must lead in the study of the psychology 
 
-P-A-G-E-211
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 211 
of religion and the practice of religious pedagogy. More chairs 
of these subjects are needed in our colleges and seminaries. 
We can use the school under religious auspices. These insti- 
tutions may consistently labor to fix the unformed character of 
young men and women by leading them to some satisfactory 
solution of the main questions of life and destiny. They may 
serve also by keeping alive among their sister institutions the 
contention that men not moral are incomplete. Thus they will 
prove their oft-questioned right to live. In institutions upon 
secular foundations, volunteer workers by individual effort and 
in such organizations as Christian Associations may keep active 
the moral life often threatened at the seat of culture. 
The playground is recognized as a mighty factor in the mat- 
ter of moral training. The organized society of the players of 
games should strengthen the good and control the dangerous 
tendencies of the young. This, however, is not to be brought 
about by selfish and bullying coaches, but by moral and master- 
ful directors. 
The intellectual element is the main one committed to the 
school. Under our definition the school must produce character 
through thinking. As teachers you will appreciate more than 
ability or intellectual achievement the improvement in the char- 
acter of your pupils. The public will regard you as great if 
you can produce it. A few practical suggestions for school 
workers will be in place. 
The teacher should do intellectual work in a moral way. 
Every act makes character. This fact calls not only for good- 
ness, but for vigor in the leader. With this in mind every fault 
stands condemned, and with such a teacher before him the pupil 
cannot leave morality out of his scheme of thought about life. 
The teacher can promote moral progress by impressing the 
value of what I call here ideal pursuits; that is, those whose 
aim is the production of men, not things. There is need for men 
trained in every technical line, but the call of the age is for the 
teacher, the parent, the agitator in morals, and the man of 
visions in every walk of life. We need more talent and attain- 
ment in the schoolroom. The teacher cannot raise salaries and 
create attractions to draw character and culture into the busi- 
ness of guiding youth. But by devotion and enthusiasm he can 
inspire his pupils without the promise of external reward to

select their callings and to work them when chosen for the bet- 
terment of men. 
The school should investigate all the phenomena of the moral 
nature. Much has been done here by religious psychologists. 
The school may also by extension courses and various forms of 
publicity increase the knowledge of the public about these phe- 
nomena. Codperation with other organizations from mothers’ 
clubs to ministers’ meetings would assist in a better under- 
standing and more successful managing of the moral life. 
The teacher should be the leader in the correlation of the 
child’s activities. Education is his study. If the other institu- 
tions fail to find it, the school should discover, use and 
strengthen the nexus that binds together the moral life of the 
home, the school and the adult life. 
An improved type can be created in a generation by training 
the child with a view to future parenthood. Every element of 
moral strength given the child today makes light the school’s 
work for tomorrow. 
In return for the regard given the school by them, it should 
show sympathy and interest in the problems of the church and 
the home. The teacher can appreciate their ideals, and rever- 
ence the crises in the moral life to which they are supposed to 
minister. In the nervous distress and agitation that accom- 
pany well marked periods of youth and often prominent at the 
revival or lenten season, the teacher should realize that these 
disturbances, annoying for the time, are to supply the greatest 
moral dynamic known. The school should seize this new force 
and make the most of it. It is to transfer the child more and 
more from control from without to control from within. Short- 
sighted and feeble teachers deplore this phenomenon and lose 
their ability to lead or control their pupils. Teachers with in- 
sight see that, if they can use it, they will make their charges 
masterful. 
These suggestions present some ways for promoting moral 
training. Any one of them may be of high service. What if 
work should be carried on in all together? Hf only with all the 
means at hands, all the corporate institutions and all the indi- 
viduals composing them should concentrate upon the one end, 
the production of moral character, it does not yet appear what 
the American youth will be.

THE RELATION OF KINDERGARTER AND PRIMARY. 
MARY D. HILL, SUPERVISOR OF KINDERGARTENS, LOUISVILLE, KY. 
Waar should the first grade teacher expect from children 
who have been in a good kindergarten from one to two years? 
Ada Van Stone Harris, formerly Assistant Superintendent 
of Kindergarten and Primary Schools, Rochester, now of Rich- 
mond, says: 
“The kindergarten stands for two things above all else; first, 
the community idea; second, the laboratory method.” . 
The kindergarten is a community, or rather a family, where 
each shares in the responsibilities and duties for the good of the 
whole, where each therefore shares in the benefits, opportuni- 
ties and pleasures, provided he respects the rights and pleas- 
ures of others. Social service, such as picking up scraps, sweep- 
ing, washing the lunch dishes, helping the younger children 
when this is needed, assisting with their wraps, ete., should de- 
velop right social relationships. Self-control is fostered through 
these means and others, a premium being set on the privilege of 
helping, and this privilege being denied those who do not con- 
trol themselves. 
Alertness, active senses and quick response to them—these 
habits should be expected from good kindergarten training. 
These answers received from some of our best primary teachers 
to the questions, which is our subject, show that the kinder- 
garten children do bring these habits into the primary. 
A first grade teacher who has received children from the 
kindergarten in her school for eight or ten years, writes: “The 
children who have graduated from the kindergarten know how 
to listen and take in what you tell them, to a certain extent to 
follow instructions, know how to go to work, to handle ma- 
terials, to handle themselves, and to recognize how many objects 
they are using.” 
To quote again from Miss Harris: “The kindergarten aims 
to establish an initial understanding between the home and the 
school—an advantage to the school. It affords an opportunity 
to hold back children to a time when they are at a point of ma- 
turity when the primary school should commence. It is often  
-P-A-G-E-214
  214 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
difficult to make parents understand the wisdom of postponing 
the beginning of school life after the child is of school age.” I 
would like to say that the kindergarten teacher should have 
the same part in deciding promotion into the first primary that 
primary teachers have in promoting to the next grade. 
Now let us see what should be expected from kindergarten 
children through the continual use of the laboratory method, or 
the experimental method—through doing real things, handling 
real objects, giving out every impression the teacher gives in 
some form of motor expression. Dr. Dewey says a child does 
not take in an idea until he has given it out, hence impression 
from real things, real activities must always go hand in hand 
with expression in some form suited to the active, growing lit- 
tle child. This is the basis of the right kind of observation— 
looking at, watching, handling, listening, experimenting with 
real things so as to make, to play, to construct them well. 
A first grade teacher says: “The kindergarten children know 
how to do things, how to express themselves and even write bet- 
ter than the others.” 
As to the enrichment of the vocabulary, which Dr. Stanley 
Hall shows is sorely needed in his pamphlet “The Contents of 
Children’s Minds on Entering School,” the kindergarten real- 
izes that one of its distinct functions is to furnish the child 
first hand experiences, both in nature and in the social and in- 
dustrial work. This is done by excursion, both city and coun- 
try, by bringing objects into the kindergarten and by having 
the children not only handle them, but use them for real experi- 
ment and work. . Miss Tanner, in her book, “The Child,” writes: 
“Tt is useless to teach the child about things until he knows the 
things themselves. This experience it is sepecially the part of 
the home and the kindergarten to supply, for they can deal with 
the child just when he is eager to exercise his senses.” 
As to training in the love of good literature in the kindergar- 
ten, Dr. Merrill says: “I believe that pictures, stories and 
songs should be used freely at this age. * * * If well se- 
lected they will carry the child beyond his environment and 
help him in forming ideals.” 
In using the blocks, finding how many he needs for this or 
that, in folding and cutting into halves, etc., all this work with 
a number of similar objects, with divisible objects, in order to 
 
-P-A-G-E-215
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 215 
good construction, lays a basis in real experience for more defi- 
nite simple number work in the primary. His number concepts 
are just ready for formulation by the primary teacher. 
That the child gains much in power of attention and concen- 
tration through his kindergarten training is shown by experi- 
ence of a number of our first grade teachers. One of them gives 
the following: “The kindergarten children who come to me 
have learned to concentrate, their powers of observation have 
been trained and they have learned to use their hands, all of 
which are of great value to the primary. When children have 
not gotten these things, there is something the matter with the 
kindergarten,” and I believe all kindergarten teachers will 
agree with this. 
Physical exercises in the form of skipping, running, games, 
plays, etc., develop a sense of rhythm, which is fundamental in 
all music, whether instrumental or vocal. Ear training, lead- 
ing to correct tone placing, is received through listening to the 
piano, singing both with and without the accompaniment, and 
all such imitative plays as each child tuning his own violin, 
horn, ringing bells, etc. The songs in the main grow up out 
of the children’s own experiences, hence they should form the 
habit of vital interest in singing. 
In concluding, I would like to say that the kindergarten is 
comparatively such a young child in the great family of edu- 
cational methods that it does not know the other members of 
this noble family well, nor do they know it. In fact, till they 
do know this youngest member, they are inclined to think it is 
a foundling and not a real member of the family. 
Let us, the two sets of teachers so near each other, consult 
and discuss our problems together, learn, each from the other, 
how to adjust our grades so as to leave no gaps between the 
kindergarten and primary, have no overlapping and make the 
kindergarten a genuine help to the hard working primary 
reacher.

THE RELATION OF SCHOOL, COLLEGE AND UNI- 
VERSITY. 
WILLIAM DINWIDDIH, M.A., LL.D., CHANCELLOR OF SOUTHWESTERN 
PRESBYTERIAN UNIVERSITY, CLARKSVILLE, TENN. 
A SCIENTIFIC system of education must be a natural system; 
hence the school for the child, the college for the youth, the 
university for the man. All three, or equivalents, are necessary 
to complete education. Self-made men have had equivalents, 
but at cost of greater effort. College men have many times the 
chance for success, and earn four times as much as unskilled 
laborers. The percentage of self-made failures is enormous and 
should be brought to light. 
Transition from school to college and from college to univer- 
sity should be as natural as that from grade to grade, or class 
class. If the unit system be employed, shall school or college 
decide as to the number and value? Or both? Or some other 
authority? Some combination of school certificate and college 
entrance examination is better than either alone. The college 
may be the better judge of mental fitness, but cannot determine 
this by a set of examinations only, because of the possibility of 
cramming. The school is the better judge of the moral fitness of 
the applicant for entrance to college, and moral requirements 
ought to be made more stringent for the sake of the college 
character, and to help the school to stimulate moral strength 
and achievement as the unit system is supposed to help it 
stimulate mental. The moral is the more important for the col- 
lege, for without it the mental is either valueless or harmful, 
and with it defective mental preparation may often be repaired ; 
and the character of the college is more important than its in- 
tellect. 
The only need in the matter of entrance requirements is a 
modicum of intelligence and a maximum of honesty. Some- 
times the proportions have been reversed. 
The relation of the separate college of letters and sciences to 
the university needs definition. This relation should be the same 
as that borne by the university’s own college of letters and 
science to its professional, technical and graduate work. Just
-P-A-G-E-217
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 217 
as the schools and colleges are coming to an agreement as to 
what a school is and what a college is; so should the colleges 
and the universities define the college and the university. The 
college should have a say, and the universities should not arro- 
gate to themselves the sole right. 
A mere unit system of entrance requirements is not broad 
enough, but if that be the accepted standard of entrance into 
college at least for the mental side of the matter, then the stand- 
ard for entrance from college to professional, technical and 
graduate work, which alone constitute the proper work of a 
university, should be also a definite number of units of college 
work. Or if we find out once more that the mind is not so easily 
measured by units and adopt some more flexible and more scien- 
tific standard, which shall test fairly all the applicant’s mental 
powers and moral character, then we ought to have this new 
and better standard between school and college, between col- 
lege and university, and between each school grade and the next 
higher, each college class and the next higher, each university 
year and the succeeding. 
Only when we recognize that this matter of preparation is 
primarily a psychological question, and take it out of the hands 
of the tyro and put it in the hands of the expert psychologist, 
only then will we reach a satisfactory and permanent result. 
[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
THE RELATION OF ART TO INDUSTRIAL WORK. 
SARAH LOGAN ROGERS, INDUSTRIAL SUPERVISOR, LOUISVILLE, KY. 
Arr and industrial work are as distinct in aim as reading 
and arithmetic, are corresponding to reading, literature, indus- 
trial work to arithmetic, science. Though there is a large seem- 
ing overlapping that has confused many and we have construc- 
tion work that is called art, and art called construction work, 
there is a natural correlation going from one into the other 
that does not interfere or cause confusion when looked at 
clearly. 
If we consider that the aim of art in the schools is: First, 
the imaging of form, line and color of flowers, nature, objects  
-P-A-G-E-218
  218 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
and people in free hand or representative drawing and paint- 
ing; and second, an appreciation of the beauties of nature, and 
treasures of art, we have a full, clear and definite aim. 
If we think of the aim of the industrial work as the making 
of the principal things of life, the most suitable for the purpose 
and of the material best adapted to that end, artistic industrial 
work will follow naturally without stepping into the realm 
of art. 
Constructive design naturally belongs in the industrial de- 
partment, the planning as well as the making of an article most 
suitable for the purpose, and this plan adapted to the material 
used. The decorative design also largely belongs here, as the 
decoration should be according to the use, material and con- 
struction, and until the industrial teachers realize and under- 
stand this, the art teachers may give all the directions and plan- 
ning they wish, the result will be unsatisfactory and inevitably 
much confusion will arise. 
I really believe the separating of the constructive and deco- 
rative design from the construction has caused the mon- 
strosities of the present day. In the outside world most of the 
designers are unfamiliar with the materials or the use to which 
that material is to be put, therefore they plan these wonders of 
the imagination that fill our shops and our homes. Shall we 
bring this into the school room? 
I am reminded here of an incident that happened several 
years ago in Lexington, Ky., at a meeting of the Southern Board 
of Education. A prominent New York architect was visiting 
in the same house with me. We were invited to a reception at 
the Woman’s Club, and in going there passed through a modern 
part of the town with all of its new flaunting houses and many 
gabled roofs. When we entered the large, old, simple house 
with its beautiful stairway going up the central hall, the archi- 
tect looked around and said, “What beautiful arrangement, 
these rooms are perfectly proportioned and that stairway is 
superb.” I answered, “Yes, we used to have many such build- 
ings. The rooms of this house were built to live in, and to let 
in the air and sunshine. The stairway was made so that the 
people could walk up easily and the roof was planned so that 
the rain would pour off without leaking through the many cor- 
ners. The architect builder made the house so people could live
-P-A-G-E-219
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 219 
in it and used the most suitable material at hand; he was an 
artist in his line without knowing the principles of art and 
learned each step unconsciously through experience, making his 
house most suitable for people to live in and of the best ma- 
terial for that purpose. 
Our new age of machinery has so separated the art naturally 
belonging in the industrial field that when a house is built, we 
get one part designed and made in New York, another in Texas 
and perhaps another from some other part of the country, and 
we cover the whole world in style, using a Queen Anne roof, 
French windows, Colonial doors and an Italian garden! 
Our chairs, too, have gone far beyond their natural use; try 
to buy one that is comfortable and test it by sitting in it. See 
how it fits! The seat should be comfortable, the back shaped to 
fit the human body which is beautiful in line. Will the arms of 
the chair be the right height as a rest for the arms of the occu- 
pant? Will it be made so we get the best construction of the 
material for wear and use? Also notice the decoration! Will 
it be carving that will hurt the head when one leans back? 
Does the decoration interfere with its use, or does it follow and 
emphasize the points of construction? 
These are fundamental points of construction fitness to pur- 
pose, adaptation to material and only decoration that carries 
out these ideas. 
How does art relate to the making of a chair? It can help in 
parallel course, by figure drawing until the image is so fixed in 
the mind that the hand naturally follows the beautiful lines of 
the human form and thus helps to make the plan, the working 
drawing or constructive design quickly beautiful. In decora- 
tion the motif to be used can be drawn free hand until the beau- 
tiful lines flow naturally from the pencil. Then this motif can 
be adapted in the industrial department to the surface to be 
decorated and to conform to the material and purpose for which 
the article is to be used, which is conventionalized design. 
The imaging of many such natural objects gives the hand 
and eye a facility for making good designs for construction 
work. 
In comparing the work of the American schools with the 
foreign schools at the International Congress of Art in London, 
three years ago, the conclusion was reached that the American
-P-A-G-E-220
220 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
schools were deficient in drawing and in exactness or fine work- 
manship. Both follow the same principles, the one in the art 
department, the other in the industrial, the principles of appli- 
cation, accuracy and repetition. This practice in drawing will 
give beauty of line, form and color, and will aid materially in 
the careful workmanship in the Industrial Department. 
How can we correlate color harmony? Color harmony can 
be taught in the Art Department by abstracting the colors from 
a natural form, and making a simple scale showing the propor- 
tion of each color. This can be reapplied in design in the In- 
dustrial Department. Scientific scales can also be made and 
reapplied in many ways. These principles learned in the Art 
Department can be adopted and utilized in the Industrial De- 
partment. 
They were learned unconsciously through experience before 
the age of machinery, and must be taught consciously through 
experience in the school. 
I should like to show you how we are beginning this in 
Louisville: For instance, in the first grade booklet, we make 
the cover to fit the tablet paper, and decorate it with a simple 
border of fall leaves cut from colored paper. Previous to cut- 
ting the leaves the children ‘should have several lessons in free- 
hand painting and drawing of the leaves. They are cut free- 
hand from white paper until the child can get a well shaped 
leaf. The colored paper is then selected to harmonize with the 
book cover, and the white paper leaf, first cut free-hand, is used 
as a pattern. The leaves are then placed in a simple rhythmic 
border. In the second grade this is repeated, taking a more dif- 
ficult leaf and using more variety in spacing the border. We 
make a border, then a center, and then combine center and 
border. By pushing the tangible leaves over the surface the 
children easily find a beautiful spacing themselves. This leads 
to stenciling in the upper grades. 
This same principle is carried out in the boxes. The boxes 
are made for a definite purpose and of material most easily 
handled in the school room. We decorated them first with a 
simple line border, then a center cut from a nature motif which 
should be first drawn in the Art Department. We then combine 
the center border on another box in another grade. 
This idea is also carried,out in weaving the rugs or hammocks
-P-A-G-E-221
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 221 
for the doll house—first, with a single line border well spaced, 
then a center from a natural motif is used, the material and size 
conventionalizing the designs. Later, the border and center are 
combined in a rug, always paying attention to spacing and 
color harmony, selecting the yarn to harmonize with the room, 
and the borders to harmonize with the color of the rug. 
This idea is then further used in decorative sewing. First, a 
needlebook is made with a center of a conventionalized natural 
motif using one color. Then a simple border is made with two 
harmonious colors. After this a pin cushion is made with a 
border and a center combined, using two or more colors. 
The relation of objects to the whole, and proportion of size 
and color is further carried out in the furnishing of a doll house. 
We weave the rugs, make the furniture, paper the walls and 
dress the dolls so all will look well together. 
I believe one of the large fields in girls’ work lies in the 
selecting of proper dress material for the purpose, making the 
clothes follow the lines of the figure and decorating them simply 
and suitably. Wemay avoid the hobble skirts, the Merry Widow 
hats, and learn how to select and make a good article and use 
it until it wears out. The figure drawing here aids materially 
in getting good lines in our everyday dress. In our schools we 
begin by making paper dolls in the first and second grades, 
dressing dolls in the third and fourth grades, and making larger 
garments by hand for the school children themselves in the 
fifth and sixth grades. 
In this way we are trying to teach the children the beauty 
and use in the common, everyday things of life.

THE RELATION OF THE PUBLIC TO THE SCHOOL 
BOARDS. 
MR. W. 0. HART, NEW ORLMANS, LA. 
Wuitn I shall endeavor to discuss the subject assigned to 
me in as general terms as possible, yet, when I come to concrete 
matters, necessarily, I will have to refer to the school boards 
of my city and State, because I have little knowledge of, and no 
familiarity with, the systems existing in other places.
-P-A-G-E-222
  222 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
At the outset, I may say that the relation of the public to the 
school boards should, in my humble judgment, be one of the 
utmost intimacy, and that on every possible occasion members 
of the school boards and those connected with the administra- 
tion of the schools, whether as directors, superintendents, teach- 
ers, or in any other capacity, should not only take the public 
into their confidence in every proposed action, but should invite 
suggestions from the public at all times and on all subjects, the 
suggestions to be given as may be most convenient, either in 
writing or personally. I believe that the meetings of every 
school board, State and local, should be open to the public, and 
that there should be no executive sessions, either of the boards 
as a whole, or of the committees thereof. 
Those entrusted with the management of school affairs are, 
more than any other public officials, the servants of the people, 
and stand in so many ways in the place of the people that every- 
thing they do should be at all times open to the public that 
criticism may be made at the time, or subsequently. 
The teacher is the only one, except the parent, outside, of 
course, of certain public institutions of confinement, where cor- 
poral punishment may be inflicted without the person inflicting 
it being called to account, and, while I am glad to note that in 
the advanced thought of the present time corporal punishment 
has been practically dispensed with in the schools, as it ought 
to have been long ago, yet I can remember as a boy that it was 
as much a part of the curriculum of the school as spelling or 
arithmetic. It was always a cause of horror to me, however— 
(though I can say that I never was punished with a whipping 
in school, probably, because in my childhood I was very small 
for my age, and, as I commenced to grow, my health was not 
of the best, which two considerations probably had more to do 
in extending mercy to me in this regard than any merit of my 
own)—to see a child whipped by a teacher, and as I have pro- 
gressed in years the horror increases, and I would apply to a 
teacher, or any other person, even a parent, who strikes a child, 
the words of the Duke in the well known play of “The Honey- 
moon:” “He who lays his hands on woman, save in the way 
of kindness, is a brute whom it would be base flattery to call 
a coward.” I would substitute for the word “woman” the word 
“child,” and thus complete the illustration.

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 223 
For twenty years or more previous to 1908 in my city, our 
school board was composed of about twenty-four members, half 
of whom were elected by the City Council, and half appointed 
by the Governor, and the system, as far as I could see, gave, so 
far as the method of appointment was concerned, great satisfac- 
tion, but, as in many other States, the craze began with the 
Constitutional Convention of 1898 in our State, that every pub- 
lic official should be elected by the people, though the only 
change in the new Constitution provided for was to make the 
seven Distict Judges in the city of New Orleans, who, up to that 
time had been appointed by the Governor, elective. But the 
Constitution has from time to time been amended, so that now 
almost every official is elected, even the Judges of our Supreme 
Court, and, finally, in 1906, a law was passed providing that, 
beginning with 1908, the School Board of the city of New Or- 
leans should be elected, and that there should be seventeen mem- 
bers, one from each ward in the city, all to be elected at once, at 
the same time that we had our municipal election, which, of 
course, threw the entire system into the vortex of politics, 
though I must say that, taken as a whole, the first board elected 
under this law is composed mostly of representative men, and 
men who are striving to do their duty, though the elective sys- 
tem is a bad one, owing to the time of the election, the division 
into wards, and the fact that the entire board must be elected 
at the same time, while, under the former system above referred 
to, the terms of the members expired at intervals, so that the 
board was a continuing body. At the first election in 1908 sev- 
eral who were on the board were re-elected, but the system is 
such that seventeen new members may all come in at any one 
election. 
The sessions of our board are always open, the public in gen- 
eral is invited, and many attend the meetings, particularly 
when any matter which has provoked discussion, in the press 
or otherwise, in advance, is to come up, when the seating capac- 
ity of the hall in which the board meets is never sufficient to 
accommodate the crowd. Of course, the public can have no 
voice in the deliberations of a school board, but it seems to me 
that, as the meeting is going on, it would be well for the mem- 
bers to consult those who take sufficient interest in the proceed- 
ings to attend the meetings, as the meetings progress, because,
-P-A-G-E-224
  224. SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
while advance discussion and advance consideration is of great 
weight, yet a suggestion at the moment of the coming up of a 
particular subject may be of great benefit, especially when it 
comes from one who is known to have the welfare of the schools 
and of the children at heart. 
The advantage of the public attending the meetings of the 
School Board was shown in a matter before our board a few 
years ago. It was concluded to have a special elocution teacher 
in the high schools, and the committee, with the idea that a 
suitable person could not be obtained at home—an idea too 
prevalent in New Orleans in many cases—invited a lady from 
Ohio to accept the position, and this before the matter had been 
finally passed upon by the board. When the news of this action 
became public, the friends of a very prominent young lady in 
New Orleans, the daughter of a distinguished Confederate sol- 
dier, and herself active in relief work for the Confederate vet- 
erans, believing that she was competent to fill the position and 
that her merits should be considered, attended the meeting of 
the School Board at which the election was to take place. As 
soon as the situation of affairs was made known, many of the 
members of the board saw that the committee was a little hasty 
in reference to the lady from Ohio, but, feeling that she would 
have been placed in a false position had she not been selected, 
concluded, after a full discussion and consideration, that there 
was room for two teachers, and so the New Orleans lady was 
employed. The Ohio lady came and gave satisfaction, but did 
not remain very long, preferring to accept a position at her 
own home, and when a vacancy arose, caused by her resignation, 
I am glad to say it was filled by another New Orleans lady. 
Now if, when this matter was under consideration by the com- 
mittee, the public had been invited and had been present, what 
was done at a subsequent meeting of the board could have been 
done at the meeting of the committee, and it would not have 
been necessary to have done aught but seek in our own city the 
necessary talent which was subsequently found to the great 
benefit of the schools. 
Still speaking of my own city, I beg to say that we have 
two general organizations, and a number of special organiza- 
tions, each limited to a particular school, which interest the

been of incalculable benefit, not only to the board as administer- 
ing the schools, but to the schools and the pupils thereof. The 
special organizations are known as “Mothers’ Clubs,” and every 
school of any size has such an organization. While, of course, 
these bodies have no official standing, their influence and moral 
effect is of the utmost importance. For instance, we have in 
New Orleans, on Canal Street, our principal avenue, and one 
of the grandest streets in the world, the Beauregard School, 
named after Louisiana’s great Confederate General. This 
school is, I believe, the finest elementary school building in the 
United States. There are many finer high school buildings, but 
no finer elemenary school, and the erection of this school was 
brought about chiefly by the influence and persistent work of 
the Mothers’ Club of the Beauregard School. Originally, the 
school was established on its present site, in what had been a 
private residence, but, as the attendance of pupils increased, 
the building, which was in no sense a school building as school 
buildings should be, was found to be inadequate and not afford- 
ing proper facilities for the work of the scholars. When the 
Mothers’ Club was organized it began the agitation for a new 
and proper building, and its efforts culminated, as I say, in the 
erection of this magnificent building, which was formally 
opened with elaborate ceremonies in October, 1909. In passing, 
I may say that almost unique in the history of public buildings 
is the fact that the cost of this structure was within the appro- 
priation, and that several hundred dollars of the amount appro- 
priated for its construction were turned back into the city 
treasury. 
I regret to say that some friction has of late developed be- 
tween our School Board and the Mothers’ Club. Of the merits 
of the controversy I know nothing, and can only hope that the 
rough edges will soon be smoothed over, and that the great 
work which the Mothers’ Clubs have done, and can do, will not 
in any way be hampered for lack of codperation and apprecia- 
tion on the part of the School Board. 
Of the general organizations, one is known as the “Public 
School Alliance,” composed of hundreds of the men and women 
of New Orleans interested in the public schools, the Presi- 
dent of which is’ Prof. Alcee Fortier, the Historian of Louis- 
jana, who occupies, and has occupied for about thirty years, 
15 
 
-P-A-G-E-226
226 SOUTHERN HDUOATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
the chair of “Romance Languages” in Tulane University, the 
great University of the South. This body holds regular meet- 
ings, and a part of the great work it has accomplished for the 
public schools within the last few years has been to secure an 
increase in the salaries of teachers. Among the members of 
this Alliance who did great work in that regard is Prof. J. M. 
Gwinn, for some time a member of the faculty of Tulane Uni-, 
versity, but who has recently been elected Superintendent of 
our public schools, a position in which I am sure he will give 
great satisfaction and elevate and improve the schools in 
every way. The Public School Alliance has also assisted ma- 
terially in the building of new schools, and while on this sub- 
ject I must say a few words about the Mayor of New Orleans, 
the Hon. Martin Behrman, now serving his second term of four 
years, he having been all but unanimously re-elected in 1908, 
when there were a few votes cast for somebody else, whose 
name, however, the people have forgotten, and when our elec- 
tion of 1812 comes around I shall be greatly surprised and dis- 
appointed if our worthy Mayor is not again chosen to conduct 
the affairs of our city, which he has done so well in the past, 
for four more years. Mr. Behrman has become known as the 
“School Mayor,” because, during his administration so many 
splendid school buildings have been erected in all portions of 
our city, including the magnificent Beauregard School, before 
referred to. But if he had done nothing else, the gratitude of 
the people must be extended to him for so arranging that the 
city has now under way three magnificent high school build- 
ings, two for girls, one of which is located on Esplanade Ave- 
nue, the main street of the lower section of our city; another 
on Napoleon Avenue, one of the principal streets of the upper 
portion of the city, and the one for the boys, on Canal Street, 
near the Beauregard School, and right opposite to which will 
soon be a branch of our public library. But, of course, not- 
withstanding the great work of the Mayor, unless he were sup- 
ported on all sides by the public, he could not, of course, carry 
out his plans for all of these schools, and to the Public School 
Alliance as representing the public, the Mayor has often ex- 
pressed his appreciation of the codperation given him by it. 
The other general organization is the “Public School Ath- 
letic League,” organized a few years ago to foster in the pub-
-P-A-G-E-227
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 227 
lic schools an interest in athletics, but in doing this, the mat- 
ter has been placed on a different plane, I think, from any 
ever before attempted; a system worthy of emulation every- 
where, because no boy or girl is allowed to take part in athletic 
contests unless that boy or girl has reached a proper standard 
in his or her studies, attendance and deportment, so that the 
Public Schoo! Athletic League is not only a great benefit to the 
physical education of the boys and girls, but it is the greatest 
incentive to study, good behavior and attendance that has 
ever been devised, because a boy or girl who wishes to enter 
its contests, which are not only interesting in themselves, but 
for which beautiful and appropriate prizes for individual 
team and school work are awarded annually, knows that any 
dereliction at school would prevent an entrance for the various 
contests, and a boy or girl seeing his or her chum going into 
these athletic contests, and he or she left out, would at once 
commence giving such attention to school duties as to be cer- 
tain of entrance the next time. 
The Boy Scouts have recently been organized in New Or- 
leans, in connection, to a certain extent, with the public 
schools, but I am not sufficiently familiar with this subject, 
and it is not yet far enough advanced for me to state. whether 
it will be an advantage to the schools or not, but I believe it 
will, and our people are giving it their hearty encouragement. 
It is not as close to the public schools, however, as is the Pub- 
lic School Atheltic League, for no one takes part in any of the 
games or contests of the latter, save a pupil of one of the pub- 
lic schools. 
Compulsory education is one of the great issues of the 
school question in which I am a firm believer. Of course, 
many people who discuss the question .of compulsory educa- 
tion, and are opposed to it, have the idea that it means that 
every boy and girl not going to school will be taken prisoner 
as it were, and forced into the schools without consideration, 
examination or preparation. But to those who have made a 
study of the problem, compulsory education, when surrounded 
with the proper safeguards and properly adminstered, will do 
more to save the child and make good citizens of our boys and 
girls than any other effort now being put forth for their bet- 
terment. And in the effort of the School Boards where com: 
 
-P-A-G-E-228
228 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
pulsory education prevails, to enforce it, the cooperation of the 
public, not only in creating a sentiment on the subject, but in 
upholding the hands of the school authorities at every point 
and at every opportunity, will do much towards making the 
system a success. ‘ 
I believe that periodical meetings of School Boards and the 
public should be held to discuss this important question, which 
must be begun in a small way, but which will increase until 
every child is forced to obtain at least the rudiments of an 
education, so that illiteracy may be a thing of the past in this 
great country. 
Another matter with which, I think, the public should be con- 
cerned, is the question of school books. I do not think that 
any School Board, no matter how eminent its members may be, 
can, of itself, decide, in a coursory examination, as to the 
merits of any particular book or set of books, and, in my 
judgment, school books should be changed until there has been 
a full discussion of the subject in which the public should be 
invited to participate. 
I believe that all deliberative bodies should be small, and 
that the final decision of questions of State, no matter how 
important or how trivial they may seem, should be made by 
the chosen representatives of the people, but I believe that 
before such final decision is rendered the public should have 
an opportunity to be heard. If School Boards and other legis- 
lative bodies take the public, as a whole, into their confidence, 
the day of the lobby will soon pass forever. Many of the 
things of which we now complain in our public affairs have 
been brought about by the fact that the lobbyist has the ear of 
the legislator, while the public, the disinterested citizen and 
those who perhaps have a knowledge of the subject, gained 
from personal experience or close study, are never listened to. 
In closing this very imperfect address, I feel that perhaps 
everything I have said may appear trite and commonplace to, 
many of you, but I have endeavored to put together, hurriedly, 
some suggestions which may lead to other and more important 
ones, and if I have said one word to awaken in any one of 
you a thought as to any one thing that may benefit our schools, 
then I feel that I have not addressed you in vain.

[ABSTRACT OF PAPER.] 
THE SCHOOL CHILD’S WELFARE. 
M. E. BROCKMAN, SUPERINTENDENT SENECA GRADED AND HIGH 
SCHOOLS, SENACA, S. C. 
In the swiftly moving events of the twentieth century there 
are many sides to this question, “The School Child’s Welfare.” 
Eyery school man who has the interest of the children in his 
school at heart has some special feature leading to the welfare 
of the school child. I wish, however, to limit the viewpoint 
somewhat on this question and consider it from the standpoint 
of medical inspection of schools, a new feature in the South 
and one that we are all interested in at this time. 
“Medicine,” wrote Plato, more than two thousand years ago, 
“is the science of health.” Today it is probably regarded as 
the science of disease. Had the truth of Plato’s dictum been 
recognized some department of preventive medicine would 
long since have been established in our midst. 
The truth of the preventive principle that prevention is bet- 
ter than cure, is appreciated only in the face of actual emi- 
nent danger, such as the outbreak of smallpox, scarlet fever, 
or diphtheria. In such an emergency nothing is left undone. 
The preventive measures adopted even savor of extrava- 
gance. But the crisis weathered, we assume our usual lethargy 
until the next epidemic breaks out in our midst. Had the im- 
portance of preventive measures been more thoroughly real- 
ized there woud have been far less delay than is manifest now 
in the recognition of medical inspection of schools. 
Medical and dental inspection of school children is a new 
department for the majority of schools—in fact, I might say 
of all schools in the South. It is not new in the North and 
in many parts of Europe. For this reason, I think, that it is 
time that we Southern people should awake to the appalling 
need of medical inspection in the schools of our Southland. 
In the United States much work has been done by the vari- 
ous municipalities in suppressing infectious and contagious 
diseases. In Boston, however, as early as 1891 a director of 
school hygiene was appointed. Following this the sanitary 
problem was considered along with scientific study of child 
life.
-P-A-G-E-230
230 SOUTHERN BDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
Other large cities in the United States have taken similar 
steps, but not as far-reaching as Boston. In 1896 Massachu- 
setts passed a mandatory law which made provision (1) for 
the eradication of contagious diseases at school; and (2) for the 
annual examination of children (a) by physicians for non- 
contagious physical defects, and (b) by teachers for defects 
of eyesight and hearing. There are four or five other States 
with probably similar laws and perhaps a hundred cities and 
towns in the North and West engaged in this work. 
Seeing what has been done in other parts of the country we 
come now to what has been done in the South. New Orleans 
was the first Southern city to take active steps in medical in- 
spection of schools in 1898, and Atlanta in 1908 and 1909. In 
South Carolina the complete modern idea of medical inspec- 
tion of schools was inaugurated in the Seneca graded and high 
schools September 23, 1909. To Dr. E. A. Hines, Secretary of 
the Board of Education of Senaca Schools is South Carolina 
indebted for having sharply called this very important matter 
to the attention of the thinking people of his State. The plan 
herewith submitted is the one adopted by his direction:

  After a reasonable time, if the treatment advised has not been 
instituted, the teacher or nurse visits the home and attempts 
to secure same, and if she fails the medical inspector himself 
tries by a personal visit. As to the necessity of this apparently 
complicated system of medical inspection or supervision, the 
following defects were discovered among 200 pupils of Senaca 
graded and high schools, who are the children of the very best 
and most prosperous citizens of the Piedmont section of South 
Carolina:

  Reasoning by comparison of statistics secured by New York 
City, there are more than five million defective children in 
this country. More than fifty per cent of all school children 
have been found defective. Examination of pupils in larger 
cities show a much greater number of defects than disclosed 
in the Senaca schools; revealing in many instances tubercu- 
losis, heart disease, vermin, deafness, idiocy, malnutrition and 
contagious and infectious diseases. In a recent examination 
of the children in the Spartanburg, S. C., city schools seventy- 
five per centum of the pupils were found defective. Is this not 
food for thought? 
In a recent article by Dr. Ben B. Lindsay, Judge of the 
Juvenile Court of Denver, Colorado, this assertion was made: 
“Medical inspection and the work of visiting nurses alone,
-P-A-G-E-232
232 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
through the directions of schools can do more for the wel- 
fare of the children of this nation than all the children’s courts 
can ever do.” This statement coming from a man who knows 
child life so well should have our earnest consideration 
at once. 
Dr. Gulich in a recent report to the State Board of Health 
of New York, stated that two defective teeth would retard a 
child six months in its studies. 
Much time will elapse before there will be brought to bear 
in all the schools the measure now successfully pursued in 
some for conserving and developing the physical soundness of 
the rising generations. But nevertheless the movement is so 
intimately related to the future welfare of our country and is 
being pushed with so great earnestness and energy by its ad- 
vocates that it is destined to be successful and permanent. 
Surely it is better to prevent and to cure disease in in- 
fancy and childhood than to seek to prolong life to 100 years 
or to support overcrowded poor law infirmaries. To bring 
medical aid and knowledge to the ignorant poor is to help 
them out of their slough; it becomes an education in itself. 
The school teacher and the doctor cannot abolish all this igno- 
rance and neglect, nor will he educate all the parents at once, 
but in the course of a few years a vast improvement will be 
noticeable if an adequate system of inspection is introduced.

THE SCHOOL PLAYGROUND AS AN EDUCATIONAL 
FACTOR. 
MISS DOROTHY FENNESSEE, BRISTOL, TENN. 
Tue school playground as an educational factor has re- 
ceived very little consideration by educators in the past, and 
the playground is potentially a factor of the greatest im- 
portance. 
To be sure, Plato and Froebel long ago asserted that play 
was the most characteristic, spontaneous activity of the child. 
In fact, it was the child and that it provided the best natural 
stock of native interests and capacities upon which to graft 
the habits of action, thought and feeling approved by the edu-
-P-A-G-E-233
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 233 
cator. But the ordinary school director is not influenced by 
their great thoughts and deeds. 
The school is still quite largely a place for sitting still in a 
seat eight or nine months of the year and for silently cram- 
ming book abstractions under the eternal dictatorship of the 
teacher. The most important instructive phases of the child’s 
life are ignored; adult standards and adult methods are thrust 
upon him; his interests and natural growth are supposed to 
revolve about amid silence, passivity, generalizations and in- 
activity. The schoolroom is still intensely individualistic in 
a growing cooperative and industrial age, and our children 
are not supposed to learn morality, social cooperation, leader- 
ship, initiative, self-direction and the art of making friends, 
by doing—by genuine self-expression in action, but by inaction 
and absorption. 
The playyard which, from the child’s standpoint, is the 
greatest laboratory for experimental citizenship we possess, 
and is neglected by most teachers, often, in our cities espe- 
cially, is not large enough as to actual space for play to merit 
consideration. In fact, over half of our public schools have 
but a fringe of land about the school building for the children 
to play on, and it is the rare school that has a gymnasium, or 
play space, in schoolrooms, and the schoolyard is as barren 
as a desert, no apparatus, no one to show a helping hand in 
play. It is far worse than a desert, as a desert would have at 
least a sand pile or two for the little folks. The teachers, 
especialy the women, rarely venture out upon this restricted 
play space, even thought, as Dwight L. Perkins says, they are 
not only underpaid, but underplayed, and the children in 
many of our schools prefer to sit in the schoolrooms and idly 
gossip rather than venture out on the crowded, undirected, 
playless ground. 
Not long ago some high school boys were warned about go- 
ing into cigar stores and poolrooms at intermissions, because 
of the bad habits certain to be formed there. The leader of 
the boys answered the Principal, Superintendent and School 
Board members in about these words: “Where shall we go? 
You give us no playground; we are not allowed freedom in 
the schoolhouse and we are in serious need of some unham- 
pered fellowship with each other. Tell us of a better place to 
   
-P-A-G-E-234
234 SOUTHERN EDUOATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
stay.” These school authorities had brought home to them by 
this lad, I think, something of the significance of this almost in- 
human treatment of vigorous boyhood in our cities. Had the 
Principal, Superintendent and Directors dared to answer as 
they thought, they would have been obliged to answer, “It is 
our’s and the people’s fault, not yours.” 
What are the results of our neglect of the playground as an 
educational factor? In the first place, the health and normal 
physical development of the children suffer. Our schools are 
great breeding places for weak lungs, flabby, pipe-stem arms 
and legs, weakened eyesight, nervousness, anemia (due to un- 
developed heart at a critical period of life), and general weak- 
ened constitution and physical incodrdination. The school life 
not only does not promote health, as it should, but it actually 
forces out bad instincts through nerve fatigue and compels 
some of the best powers to emaciation, or atrophy. One has 
only to read the reports of careful medical supervisors and in- 
spectors of school children in cities, or to glance through a 
scientific treatment of the situation like Gulick’s book on 
“Medical Supervision,” or the anthropologist Tyler’s “Growth 
and Education,” to see that American education does not put 
first things first and is not giving the American child a square 
deal. In his book on “In the Light of Evolution,” in the 
chapter on “The Evolution of Our Social Environment,’ Pro- 
fessor Tyler puts the school situation thus: 
We seem sometimes to have forgotten that the aim of school and col- 
lege is not primarily learning, but the development of strong, well-bal- 
anced men and women, who can bear the burdens and do the work of 
their own place in life, and meet the emergencies of a complex civiliza- 
tion. The chief business of the lower grades (below high school) should 
be to promote healthy physical growth. The body of the young boy and 
girl demands more care and attention than the mind. Pulmonary, rather 
than cerebral, capacity is the best promise of future usefulness. Play- 
ground, garden and gymnasium can help more than desk and recitation. 
Both are needed, but the physical is first; afterwards that which is 
mental and spiritual. 
The medical profession has the same view. Professor New- 
ton, writing in a late number of the Journal of the Ameri- 
can Medical Association, says: 
Our present ill-advised system of public instruction is constantly de- 
feating its own ends and turning out invalids, cranks and bookful block-
-P-A-G-E-235
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 235 
heads, simply for the want of a well-balanced curriculum of instruction 
according an appropriate place for physical education. 
And here again, is Herbert Spencer’s testimony on the situa- 
tion written fifty years ago and still to the point. Spencer 
says, at the end of his chapter on the need of physical edu- 
cation: 
Our general conclusion is, then, that the ordinary treatment of chil- 
dren is, in various ways, seriously prejudicial. It errs in deficient feed- 
ing, deficient clothing, in deficient exercise (among girls at least) and in 
excessive mental application. Considering the regime as a whole, its 
tendency is too exacting; it asks too much and gives too little. In the 
extent to which it taxes the vital energies, it makes the juvenile life 
much more like the adult life than it should be. It overlooks the truth 
that, as in the fetus the entire vitality is expended in the direction of 
growth and as in the infant the expenditure of vitality in growth is so 
great as to leave extremely little for either physical or mental action, 
so throughout childhood and youth, growth is the dominant requirement 
to which all others must be subordinated; a requirement which dictates 
the giving of much and the taking away of little—a requirement which, 
therefore, restricts the exertion of body and mind to a degree propor- 
tionate to the rapidity of growth—a requirement which permits the 
mental and physical activities to increase only as fast as the rate of 
growth diminishes. . . . Instead of respecting the body and ignor- 
ing the mind, we now respect the mind and ignore the body. Both of 
these attitudes are wrong. We do not yet sufficiently realize the truth 
that as in this life of ours the physical underlies the mental, the mental 
must not be developed at the expense of the physical. The ancient and 
modern conceptions must be combined. 
II. 
Are you not now ready to agree with me and act on the con- 
clusion that our school systems of today are not well bal- 
anced, to the loss of physical power? Our educational system 
was wrought out in the main by childless monks, living an 
ascetic life in monasteries, who reversed the Greek system of 
physical above mental, and went to the extreme of mental, to 
the exclusion of physical education. What we need, and what 
we are going to get, is a better balanced system of child cul- 
ture, that will take the child as he is and our complex civiliza- 
tion as it is, and harmonize and adjust the two in a humane, 
scientific manner. 
If what has been presented seems pessimistic, let us remem- 
ber with Horace Greely that “to be conscious of a need or a
-P-A-G-E-236
  236 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
deficiency is to be far on the way whereby we shall at last 
overcome it.” 
And there is plenty of evidence that we are soon to over- 
come our deficency and have a truly balanced educational sys- 
tem. In the last few years we have witnessed the awakening 
of the physical consciousness of the race which has lain dor- 
mant since the time of old Greece. Hygiene, public and per- 
sonal; school sanitation; public parks; gymnastic; folk danc- 
ing; medical supervision; manual and industrial training; va- 
cation play schools; the school as a social and recreation cen- 
ter; attention to the home conditions of the children; vacant 
lot associations for gardening; and home, school and municipal 
playgrounds have received more attention in the last five 
years than in all the past five centuries put together. National 
and international organizations have been formed to promote 
the idea expressed by Browning when he wrote: 
And soul helps not body more 
Than body helps soul. 
Among these organizations are the International School As- 
sociation, the Playground Association of America, the Na- 
tional Industrial Education Association, the American So- 
cial Education Congress, and the National Playground Asso- 
ciations of America, Germany, England and Italy. Educators, 
sociologists, scientists, statesmen, our increasingly powerful 
women’s clubs of the country, and even the business men and 
politicians are becoming interested in a vital, practical way in 
bringing the child back into his own world. It is estimated 
that last year fifty million dollars were spent in the United 
States alone in providing play facilities for children, where 
there had been but thousands spent before. Luther Burbank 
has given us his book on “The Training of the Human Plant.” 
Ex-President Roosevelt has expressed his feelings in a num- 
ber of letters on the need of play and playgrounds, in one of 
which he says, “Playgrounds should be provided for the child 
as much as schools,” and again, “The neglect of this matter is 
to our discredit as a people.” 
A great many professors of pedagogy in our colleges are 
keeping their children out of school entirely till the age of 
nine or ten, to play and prolong their infancy, instead of short-
-P-A-G-E-237
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 237 
ening it. These children are generally stronger in most of 
the school work after their first semester than the children of 
their own age. 
There are half-time schools where children work at books in 
the morning only. The afternoon is given over to outside play, 
gardening and industrial work of various kinds. The scholar- 
ship of these children is in no way inferior to that of those 
who spend all their time in their narrow seats. 
The juvenile court judges of the country are all ardent be- 
lievers in the playground movement, and Dr. Favill, Presi- 
dent of the Chicago Tuberculosis Institute, says that one good 
playground in Chicago will do more to prevent the great white 
plague of consumption than all the physicians in the city. 
And lastly, we have the testimony of the child-student spe- 
cialist on the educative and social value of play for children. 
Professor Dressler, of the University of California, has this 
to say: 
One of the most urgent needs of our schools is better equipment for 
playgrounds; for free play is one of the highest forms of manual train- 
ing. Playing ball and tennis are better organizing agents for the larger 
and more fundamental adjustments than any sort of work in wood and 
iron. Our notion of manual training should be so broadened that it 
should consist not only of shop work, but of many kinds of field work, 
and abundance of regular playground experience. 
The child psychologist holds that “play is not simply for 
fun and health; it is demanded by nature as the most natural 
and helpful process looking toward physical and spiritual en- 
largement and unification.” He shows that play and manual 
training serves almost the same purpose, except that play fur- 
nishes more opportunity for self-expression and is far cheaper, 
and that manual training is perhaps a little closer to industry 
in later life. 
IIl. 
Can we not agree, then, that this movement for playgrounds 
is part of a world movement, and that we as educators should 
be leaders in the movement? Cannot we agree that play, espe- 
cially organized play under skilled supervision, is education? 
I believe we can; and we can point out the following definite 
educative features:
-P-A-G-E-238

it is joyful, and it is recreative, far more than heavy gymnas-

2. Play is the best form of manual training; it puts motor

of the fundamental bodily codrdinations. Nature knows best. 
3. Play is a great health producer. It is the best protection 
against tuberculosis, which carries away one out of every six 
or seven of our people. It provides for normal physical de- 
velopment and makes the children strong enough to endure 
the indoor confinement that school children and an increasingly 
large number of adults in our city life are doomed to suffer. 
4, Play is good moral training, because it teaches the ethics 
of the deed. It is experience and opportunity to act in the 
living preesnt that we must furnish our children, not preach- 
ments and generalizations. What Christ said to adults is true 
of children: “Ye must be doers of the deed if ye would know 
the doctrine.” 
5. Play is excellent social training in leadership, codpera- 
tion, courage, the making of friends, self-denial, and acting 
from social motives and real interests. It transforms the gang 
into the group. 
6. Play is mental training, as we have shown, and it furthers 
the mental training of the schoolroom by keeping the children 
in better shape to do it. 
7. Play is social economy. It decreases juvenile crime. At 
Hull House, Jane Adams; Allan Burns and others made a 
juvenile crime map of a section of Chicago. A map of the 
residences and number of cases in the Juvenile Court before 
the parks and playgrounds were put in was compared with one 
showing the same after the playgrounds had been in use three 
years. It showed a remarkable thining out of juvenile crime 
—thirty per cent within a half mile of the playground. Since 
we spend three dollars in this country for taking care of our 
criminals to every dollar spent on charity, education and re- 
ligion combined, we see what a saving playgrounds will bring 
to society. 
8. Play is a good form of nature study, for it is outdoors 
most of the time, deals with real things and persons, and will
-P-A-G-E-239
  JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 239 
be real nature study in the school garden and geography ex- 
cursions, which are all play to the child. 
9. Play is for the child religious training. The child learns 
to appreciate and to love his brother and to act with a fine, 
emotional sense of joyous at-oneness with the universe. 
Iv. 
Now for the practical outcome! I write not to furnish an 
academic discussion of the philosophy of play, but to offer a 
catalogue of reasons for play development, what is being 
thought and done in the work, and to suggest several practical 
lines of activity. We have all become pragmatists these days 
and want to read or listen to get guidance for action. 
1. In the first place, each teacher, as a leader of social prog- 
ress in the community, should study play directly at his own 
school, in the best books, and retrospectively, in his own ex- 
perience. Johnson little book on “Education by Plays and 
Games” and “American Playgrounds,” by Mero, are the best 
books; “Growth and Education” by Tyler, and “One Hundred 
and Fifty Gymnastic Games” by the Boston Normal School 
are also good. MHall’s book on “Youth” and the magazines, 
The Playground and Hygiene and Physical Education are very 
helpful. 
2. Next we should work to establish a standard of school 
playground by legislation, ordinance or board rule. If the 
School Board cannot acquire space then the community should 
do so through special tax assessment. 
3. Next, apparatus and play tools should be put in. Chil- 
dren must have things to handle and by which to handle them- 
selves. Most of such apparatus can be constructed by the 
teacher or principal and the boys. The janitor is always ready 
to show his handicraft, learned on the farm, and the cost need 
not be great. Earn the money by community enterprise or 
form a playground association and have your dues five dollars 
per member. 
4, Educate your community by circular letters, speeches and 
public discussion. Start with some simple apparatus and 
demonstrate its usefulness. The boys will soon be performing 
their twenty-five different stunts on the turning poles. Get 
your architect interested and work to get expressions from 
your Superintendent.
-P-A-G-E-240
  240 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
5. Continue your work with the basketball goals, if possible, 
climbing ladders, traveling ring, etc., such as may be attached 
to the large combination apparatus shown in the playground 
equipment catalogues. The catalogues will give you many 
ideas of construction, even if you do not wish to pay the fancy 
prices in all cases. Leave space, or set apart space, for group 
games, such as pullaway, tag, ball, three-deep and others. 
6. Join the Playground Association of America and get its 
monthly magazine. 
7. If you are in a city, work for a department of school 
hygiene, which will take charge of play and playgrounds, medi- 
cal supervision, sanitation, the health of teacher and pupils, 
and all that pertains to health and growth. 
8. Put into your course of study such a graded series of 
indoor and outdoor games as is furnished teachers in St. 
Louis, Rochester, Boston and elsewhere, and give regular time 
to these games. Boston now takes an hour a week as a part 
of the regular programme for games, besides the recesses, 
physical training period of ten or fifteen minutes daily, and 
the two-minute recreation game or action-song between reci- 
tations. 
9. Urges other teachers to go, and go yourself, upon the 
playground and engage heartily in the children’s play. Be 
with them enough to keep right influences dormant, but do not 
become an overseer, a boss, or policeman. On the playground 
you will see the children as they really are, as animals, not as 
scholars. All their good and bad characteristics come out and 
the general tendency with your presence will be an upward 
one. See to it that your playground is a laboratory of citi- 
zenship.

THE SCHOOL FARM IN RURAL EDUCATION. 
Z. V. JUDD, RALEIGH, N. C. 
Since farming is not only the biggest of all industries, en- 
gaging the activities of more than 50 per cent of our people, 
but is also the most common mode of living—then all people, 
city and country alike, to be roundly educated, should know 
something of farming. However this may be, it is imperative
-P-A-G-E-241
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 241 
that those people who live on the farm and make their living 
by farming should know better how to prosecute their daily 
vocation in order that they may increase the annual output 
from their farms; that they may have a greater share of the 
comforts and luxuries, and that they may find happiness in 
an enriched rural life. It is imperative, therefore, that coun- 
try children be taught not merely agriculture, but farming, 
which includes the science of agriculture and the agricul- 
turist’s mode of living. 
The conviction deepens that the real problem of education is 
so to analyze and understand the processes of living that they 
may be turned to account and made the means of education. 
The elementary school, therefore, seems to be the place 
where the great battle with agricultural ignorance must be 
fought out, and where the impetus must be received that will 
earry the boys and girls up through the high school and into 
the college, eager for adaptable information that will enable 
them to find contentment, happiness, health, and prosperity in 
comfortable rural homes. 
The school farm is offered as suggestive of the way in which 
this coddination of living and education may be worked out. 
Because of the recent advent of the school farm into our 
educational life, it may be necessary to tell just what the 
school farm is. It will be better understood by telling briefly 
how it originated a few years ago in Wake County, North Caro- 
lina, and how the movement has attained its present promising 
proportions in that county. 
Passing through one of the small villages of the county, the 
Superintendent of Schools visited the President of the local 
Woman’s Betterment Association and suggested that two of 
the ten acres of ground belonging to the district school be put 
under cultivation; that all the patrons and friends of the 
school be invited to work in mass, and that the proceeds of the 
farm be used to increase the annual apportionment received 
from the county. Among other reasons assigned for advocat- 
ing such a measure, he stated that for all the people to engage 
thus in farm labor would serve to dignify the work in the 
minds of the young people of the community; that, by causing 
the people to meet together on a common plane without regard 
to social, financial, or other distinctions, there would be de- 
16 
   
-P-A-G-E-242
    242, SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
veloped a finer neighborhood spirit, and thus a higher form of 
society. There would be derived from this labor money greatly 
needed to supplement the regular funds, and there would be 
afforded an excellent opportunity for teaching in a simple, 
but effective way some lessons in agriculture. 
At a very early meeting of the local Betterment Association 
the plan was considered and enthusiastically adopted. Not 
only the school children, but the grown-up boys and girls, as 
well as the men and women of the community, met at the call 
of chosen leader, whom they called School Farm Superintend- 
ent, to plant and to cultivate the school farm. At the end of 
the year the crop was sold for the net sum of $128.28. 
Last year there were eleven school farms or two acres each 
in the county. Not deducting for duplicates, 1,207 persons en- 
gaged in work on these farms. Some of the farms were more 
successful than others. Among the best were: the Rock Spring 
School farm, planted in cotton. The crop was sold for $250.00, 
which, with some premiums won at the State Fair and some 
local prizes, ‘netted the school more than $300.00; the Turner 
School, planted in tobacco. This crop was sold for $313.50. 
During the year just closing, there were sixteen farms, full re- 
ports from which have not yet been obtained. 
In many instances the money made on these school farms 
exceeded the amount appropriated by the county to the schools 
operating them. With the money thus made, the committee 
lengthened the school term, and increased the salaries of the 
teachers. 
The social phase of the school farm is emphasized by the 
introduction of the picnic feature. Sometimes light refresh- 
ments are served; on other occasions there are abundant 
feasts of barbecue, fried chicken, and all those delicacies 
known only to rural cooks. Frequently baseball games and 
other contests afford entertainment after the work is over. 
Often the County Superintendents is invited to the “Working 
Be,” as these group workings are called. He engages with the 
people in their work and play, and uses the occasions to speak 
on any topic which may be of vital concern to the people. 
Any institution to live and grow must be built upon funda- 
mental natural laws. The school farm is thus founded. 
One of the most powerful human instincts, the influence of
-P-A-G-E-243
JOURNAL OF PROCHEDINGS. 243 
which is emphasized by William McDougall in his recent So- 
cial Psychology, is the gregarious instinct. McDougall claims 
that instead of the dullness of the country driving people to 
the towns, it is the crowds in the towns, the vast human herd, 
that exerts a baneful attraction on those outside of it. Today, 
while thousands lack for employment in the cities, the farms 
are being deserted for the lack of laborers. In the rural dis- 
tricts, this same instinct causes the people to gather in the 
nearby towns, villages and at the crossroads store, on Satur- 
day afternoons, where, without aim of purposes, the idle drift 
into gossip, profanity and drinking. 
Another pronounced instinct is the instinct for contest. It 
frequently takes the shape of betting, whether on a cock fight, 
a wrestling match, or a horse race at the county fair. Another 
is the instinct for government, yet another for play. 
The school farm gratifies the instinct of people to associate. 
In the work of the school farm, the boys and girls engage in 
friendly contests under the most favorable conditions. The 
baseball and other games that often follow at the close of the 
work and that take place at intervals during the summer, 
gratify the play instinct and afford the much-needed diversion 
from the monotonous rounds of daily life on the farm. 
In the way the people of the community share their joys and 
their pleasures and unite in friendly intercourse, all the while 
dominated by a common purpose and aim, that of the good 
of the mass rather than that of the individual. Thus is evolved 
the highest form of society. An accepted definition of society 
is that of a group of people working together in a common 
spirit and toward a common end. Judged by this standard, 
I know of no truer type than that developed by the school 
farm. 
As above pointed out, any institution, in order to grow to 
significant proportions, must be founded on natural laws. It 
it be an educational institution, cognizance must be taken of 
the underlying laws of mind. The broadest and most impor- 
tant laws of teaching, as pointed out by Professor McMurray, 
briefly, are: induction, apperception, aim, self-activity, absorp- 
tion and reflection, motor-activity, interest, and correlation. 
It can be seen at a glance that the school farm embodies these 
laws and is, therefore, truly a teaching force.
-P-A-G-E-244
  244 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOOIATION. 
Since for the young and for the untrained adult mind, any 
industry must be studied as an art rather than as a science, 
this great business of farming must be prosecuted under some 
such impelling interest and aim as that of providing means 
for the support of the school, and only incidentally shall the 
science of agriculture be introduced. Moreover, if our people 
are to be truly educated, the period of instruction must extend 
beyond the school period. 
This paper offers the school farm as a component part of 
the elementary school in close touch with the people, influenced 
by their needs, and, in turn developing in them a greater 
sense of their needs and inefficiency. It would undertake 
to say that the school farm is founded on natural human laws, 
and is, therefore, destined to grow and to remain without un- 
due effort as a part of our larger educational life; that it is 
founded on pedagogical laws, and is, therefore, a good medium 
of instruction.

THE TRAINING OF GIRLS FOR HOME-MAKING. 
MISS CARRIE BELLE HYDE, SUPERVISOR OF PRACTICH HOME, WIN- 
THROP COLLEGE, ROCK HILL, S. C. : 
Tue home is the central unit of our social life. As are the 
individual homes, so will be the community, so will be the na- 
tion. There is not a single human activity that is not affected 
by the home. Then home-making in an appallingly broad sense 
would naturally embrace all other professions. To reduce it, 
however, to more tangible proportions, we might say that the 
science of home-making must embrace all those things that im- 
mediately affect the life, health and character of the family. 
Tranining for home-making, then, must provide special in- 
struction in biology, physiology, physics, chemistry, food and 
its preparation, dietetics, the house sanitation, house furnish- 
ings and decoration, housekeeping, proper expenditures and ac- 
counts, sewing, dressmaking and other household arts and in- 
dustries, child study, home-nursing and emergencies, the home 
in its relation to individual and social life. 
That part of biology known as bacteriology is of greatest im- 
portance to the home-maker, for it is the fundamental science
-P-A-G-E-245
  
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 245 
underlying sanitation. She needs to know the life history of 
bacteria as regards food and its preservation, but chiefly does 
she need this knowledge in combating disease. With the con- 
ditions of life and climate such as they are, it is especially im- 
portant that the Southern home-maker should be informed 
along this line. We are told that the typhoid germ murders 
about 600 people yearly in South Carolina and makes about 
6,000 others very seriously ill—and statistics show that South 
Carolina does not take the lead. This will serve as an illustra- 
tion without speaking of the ravages of tuberculosis, diph- 
theria, hookworm and other preventable diseases. 
KNOWLEDGE LIGHTENS DAILY HOUSEWORK. 
The physics and chemistry needed are the physics and chem- 
istry of everday life. The body has been described as a purely 
physical and chemical engine, with life supported by these 
forces and ceasing when they stop. A knowledge of physics 
and chemistry assists greatly in doing away with so-called 
drudgery, not only by helping actually to lighten the work, but 
by investing that work with vital interest. In the cooking of 
the daily meals there will be eliminated the ideas of chance 
and failure when the cook realizes that with the same ma- 
terials and the same conditions she must necessarily get identi- 
cal results. 
The making of biscuits, muffins or cake becomes an interest- 
ing piece of laboratory work when she realizes the chemical 
action that is to take place between the soda and the acid of 
the milk, or between the acid and alkali which she has care- 
fully weighed into her home-made baking powder, and the 
physical action of the resulting gas, which, in its efforts to es- 
cape, puffs up the bread and makes it light and wholesome. 
Interest will be hightened when she computes the difference in 
cost—the mere difference, mind you—between using sweet milk 
and baking powder and buttermilk and soda, for her biscuits, 
and finds that, allowing one cup of milk for each meal for a 
year, she can save about $26 by having the milk supply the 
acid. When she can add to this a knowledge of the food prod- 
ucts she is using, their growth, culture and manufacture, of the 
countries and people who furnish them, of their chemical com- 
position, of the resulting metabolism when taken into the body,  
-P-A-G-E-246
246 SOUTHERN HDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
of their different results in different climates, or for different 
seasons of the year, or for the members of the family according 
to the difference in ages, occupations and personal peculiari- 
ties; when she considers different ways of using them, or best 
and easiest methods of doing the work in hand, she is too 
highly entertained to give a thought to drudgery. Prof. Bevier 
well says: “The woman who announces that housekeeping is 
drudgery, and that she keeps as far away from it as possible, 
thus confesses that she has been unequal to her task.” 
When personal physiology and hygiene of the home are ex- 
alted to their true place, then, indeed, “health will become the 
business of the individual, rather than of the physcian.” When 
the home-maker learns to plan and care for her house and its 
surroundings on truly sanitary principles; when she learns 
properly to value drainage, fresh air and sunshine and to 
guard against the dangers of dust, flies and mosquitoes; when 
she puts into practice the principles of dietetics and whole- 
some cooking, and adds to this suitable clothing for her family, 
she will have reduced to a minimum the question of health in 
her household. However, accidents and disease sometimes hap- 
pen in the best regulated families; therefore, the home-maker 
should have training for emergencies and home-nursing, and 
her cooking should embrace theory and practice in the prepa- 
ration of food for invalids and convalescents. 
A house never attains anything of its real value till it be- 
comes invested with the home atmosphere which the true home- 
maker can and does give to it, but from the first it should be 
so planned, constructed and furnished as to make a convenient 
workshop for the home industries. It means much for the 
health and happiness of the household that the work should be 
made as easy and as light as possible through conveniences and 
simple furnishings, while the influence of the harmonious and 
artistic in decoration can hardly be overestimated. William 
Morris’s injunction cannot be overstressed, “Have nothing in 
your home which you do not know to be useful or believe to be 
beautiful.” 
The home-maker should be the most efficient of housekeepers, 
knowing how to do easily, quickly and well all the work of the 
house, so that she may skillfully direct if she has help, or 
graciously do it herself if it falls to her lot, for the home-maker
-P-A-G-E-247
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 247 
must be the every-ready chairman of an emergency committee. 
Herein seems to lie the solution of the servant problem. 
WOMEN SHOULD BE TRAINED IN THE USE OF MONEY. 
While the man is the provider, usually the woman is the 
spender. Much attention has been given to preparing the man 
for his part of the work, but very little consideration has been 
given to the woman’s part, although it is equally as important 
and as difficult. If she has much to spend she should know 
how to do it wisely; if only a little, cheerfully and economi- 
cally; that is, so that she gets the most and the best out of the 
least. The woman’s ability to spend wisely will mean much 
for happiness, while the lack of it may be the cause that “keeps 
many a man’s nose to the grindstone.” 
Perhaps the item of expenditure next important to that of 
the dietary is clothing for the family. Knowledge, experience 
and skill are required in selecting fabrics best suited to the 
purpose they are to serve, for there must be consideration of 
durability, harmony and general appropriateness. Knowledge, 
experience and skill are likewise required in the fitting and 
making of these garments, or in directing others. Besides sew- 
ing, there are numerous other allied household arts well de- 
serving consideration. In addition, there are what we may 
call outside home industries that may mean much in the way 
of pleasure.and diversion to the woman in the home, as well as 
being a help in reducing expenses and forming a valuable 
source of income; for instance, poultry raising, bee keeping, 
gardening, dairying. 
As to child study and motherhood, here is a whole profession 
in itself. Without a doubt, ignorance and neglect of the child’s 
physical well-being have sent many a little one to an untimely 
grave, while an infinitely worse ignorance, that of the child’s 
mentality, has, no doubt, warped and perverted the moral and 
spiritual life of untold thousands. Truly, “God pity the poor 
little orphans whose fathers and mothers are living.” Surely 
ignorance of the responsibility being assumed is the only rea- 
son for girls without training being thoroughly appalled at the 
idea of undertaking the care and making of a home. 
It is only a very few years since the South.began to awaken 
to the need of any training for the home. Conditions have 
 
-P-A-G-E-248
248 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
been such as to create more or less prejudice against domestic 
science. But that prejudice seems about all to have passed 
away, and in its place we find an eager desire for knowledge 
that may help improve the home and home life. In all the 
Southern States much work is being done through domestic 
science courses, clubs and women’s institutes. In South Caro- 
lina domestic science has formed part of the course at Win- 
throp since the founding of the college, fifteen years ago. It is 
only recently, however, that we find it is coming to its full 
fruitage and attaining its highest practical value. A little 
more than a year ago the Practice Home was established. The 
house was a queer old structure that had stood on the campus 
for a number of years, and had become noted for its many in- 
conveniences. 
PLACE TO PUT KNOWLEDE TO A PRACTICAL TEST. 
We took this old house, which corresponds faily well to the 
average country home, and attempted to show the possibilities 
of such a home. The kitchen was changed, a pantry and sew- 
ing room added, and all furnished with convenient, built-in 
cabinets and cupboards. The walls and ceiling were tinted, 
the floors given a hard finish and some colored glass casement 
windows replaced by clear glass. The whole house has been 
simply and plainly, but artistically, furnished, and now the 
original is hardly recognizable in our attractive little home. 
Only the seniors live in the home. They have already had two 
years of domestic science and domestic art in their regular col- 
lege course, and now in the home they have an opportunity, 
under supervision, to make practical application of the prin- 
ciples they have learned. They come over in groups of eight 
and stay eight days each term, during which time each one 
has an opportunity to do all the work of an ordinary home, 
planning the menus, looking after pantry supplies, preparing 
and serving the meals for this family of nine, keeping accounts 
and doing all forms of housework. The social side is given 
prominence in simple entertaining of guests at informal home 
meals, and Monday afternoon teas, while the ability to create 
a home atmosphere is rated above all else. The work is so 
systematized that it is no hardship to anyone, and does not 
interfere with other college work. All who wish have an op-

portunity for work in the poultry yard, with the bees and the 
gardening. A small model dairy and barn and a small model 
laundry are soon to be added. The girls are earnest and eager 
to learn, so there is opportunity in a pleasant, social way for 
giving and discussing much of the theory of the work indicated 
for home-training. We are hoping, through our girls, greatly 
to help the rural homes of our State, for they can and will 
carry away better ideas of doing things and higher ideals of 
what a home should be. 
NEW PLAN HAS AWAKENED A WIDESPREAD INTEREST. 
Much good has been accomplished by combining a pro- 
gramme for women with the farmers’ institutes, and through 
the organization of home-makers’ clubs. Infinitely more, we 
hope, is soon to be accomplished, for the people are awakened 
and eager for the work. A movement is already on foot to 
put a true, simple form of domestic science in not only the high 
schools, but in all the elementary schools of the State. 
All the movements in the various States show that senti- 
ment is keenly alive to the need of bettering the homes. This 
means, ultimately, that in the individual homes all the mem- 
bers of the family will have opportunity for the best develop- 
ment, physically, mentally, morally and spiritually. But it 
means more, for the individual homes will carry help and in- 
spiration to other homes, thus benefiting community life and 
helping in the general uplift of mankind. 
“To make and inspire the home; to lessen suffering and in- 
crease happiness; to aid mankind in its upward struggles; to 
ennoble and adorn life’s work, however humble—these are 
woman’s high prerogatives.

WHAT CAN THE COLLEGES DO TO ADVANCE THE 
CAUSE OF GOOD ROADS? 
G. N. MITCHAM, PROFESSOR OF CIVIL ENGINEERING, ALABAMA 
POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE. 
Ir we would find an answer to the question: What can the 
colleges do to advance the cause of good roads, we must first 
‘inquire in what directions assistance is most needed, and what 
are the obstacles in the way of the advancement of this great 
movement; for our aid will be most effective in helping to over- 
come these obstacles. 
The greatest bar to the progress of the good roads movement, 
as well as to all other great movements for improving the con- 
dition of mankind, is the indifference of the people. The peo- 
ple do not realize the need of good roads, and their value as 
agents in the development of the community is not appreci- 
ated. It is true that roads are a product of civilization; but 
they are also the most important factors in its advancement; 
and without roads the other great civilizing influences, the in- 
vention of printing, and the other arts so useful and beneficial 
to the human race would be ineffectual, or productive of very 
limited advantages. 
It would be out of place for me to enter here upon a discus- 
sion of the advantages of good roads, for I take it for granted — 
that every one in this convention is in sympathy with the move- 
ment for good roads, and I shall only discuss what we can do 
to promote the cause. 
A great many of you would probably challenge my statement 
that the people do not realize the need of good roads; for, if 
you could ask every citizen whether he favors good roads, you 
would probably not receive a single negative answer. If, how- 
ever, you should couple your question with a definite proposi- 
tion to provide for building a system of good roads at the ex- 
pense of the community, you would discover a very consider- 
able opposition, and a vigorous campaign of education must of 
necessity precede a bond issue for road building. Everybody 
would like to have good roads, just as they would like to have 
an automobile, a fine house, or any. other luxury, but when it
-P-A-G-E-251
  JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 251 
comes to ordering and paying for them they are not so en- 
thusiastic. When you first call on them to support a definite 
proposition to provide for good roads they think that the com- 
munity is too poor to afford fine roads, but as a matter of fact 
they can better afford the good roads than the bad ones. 
One very effective way in which the colleges can aid this 
cause is to join hands with the public-spirited citizens of the 
good roads associations and other organizations in the cam- 
paign of education which will bring the people to a realiza- 
tion of the enormous financial and social advantages that may 
be derived from the improvement of their public highways. 
Our rural population does not realize the stupendous sum 
that they are now wasting every year in hauling their produce 
and supplies over roads with steep gradients and with surfaces 
full of ruts and mudholes. If it were possible to estimate ac- 
curately the annual cost of hauling over bad roads, we would 
find it to be an incredible sum. If the annual saving in the 
cost of hauling, due to the increased loads that could be hauled 
by the same teams over the improved roads could be clearly’ 
shown to the people, they would be astounded. 
If the social advantages that may be derived from good roads 
could be brought prominently to their attention, we would 
have no trouble in providing throughout our country these 
most important factors of modern civilization. The average 
farmer, when it is proposed to issue bonds for road building, 
looks only at what is to him an enormous sum, and he figures 
that, with the present assessed valuation of the property in the 
county, his taxes will be increased so much in order to pay the 
interest and sinking fund charges; and, left to himself, he fails 
to see that the improved roads which will be built with the 
proceeds of the bond sale will save him every year many times 
the increase in his taxes, to say nothing of the social advan- 
tages that will be conferred upon the community by the im- 
proved roads. 
It is sometimes difficult to convince a farmer that he is wast- 
ing money in hauling his produce and supplies over bad roads 
and that the roads built by the proceeds of a bond sale will be 
to his financial advantage. In fact, many farmers do: not 
realize that it costs them anything to haul their produce to 
market and to haul their supplies back home, for they figure
-P-A-G-E-252
252 SOUTHERN EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION. 
that because they haul them with their own teams and drivers it 
costs them nothing. 
Now, the agricultural colleges, through their extension de- 
partments, are getting the attention of the farmers. They are 
adopting the suggestions of your agricultural lecturers and 
demonstrators, and as a consequence they are beginning to 
farm in a scientific manner, and are putting brains to work on 
the soil with truly wonderful results. 
For many years we have been witnessing a migration of the 
white people from the farms to the town. The farmer’s boy 
has been finding very little on the farm that was attractive, 
and when he once observed the superior conveniences and so- 
cial advantages of the town he had very little desire to go back 
to the farm. Owing to the influence of the great agricultural 
colleges and their great agricultural extension work in co- 
operation with the United States Department of Agriculture, 
the tide is beginning to turn. The young men are being shown 
that they can earn far more than a miserable livelihood on 
their farms; increasing numbers of them are taking the agri- 
cultural courses, and they are going back to the farms and 
are applying with great success the scientific methods of farm- 
ing that they have learned at college. 
One way in which we can reach the people of the rural com- 
munities is through those progressive young farmers. We 
should have in our colleges a course of lectures on “The Eco- 
nomics of Good Roads,” which should be given not only to the 
students in civil engineering, but to the agricultural and other 
students also. These young men whom you are educating as 
scientific farmers in a short time will be the most influential 
citizens of the communities in which they live; and, if you will 
also educate them in the gospel of good roads, they will be the 
most effective missionaries that we can get to carry this gospel 
to the less progressive citizens of the communities in which 
they reside. These progressive young farmers will not resist 
the truth that good roads are essential to the highest develop- 
ment of the industrial and social life of the rural communities, 
but will embrace it, and they will advocate the cause of good 
roads whenever and wherever they may have an opportunity. 
They will see to it that the question of good roads is made an 
issue in the elections, and that men are sent to your legislative
-P-A-G-E-253
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 253 
assemblies who are pledged to legislation that will best pro- 
mote the building in every community of public highways over 
which both freight and passenger vehicles may be drawn with 
comfort and safety, with rapidity and with the least possible 
resistance at all seasons of the year. 
In many communities the people want good roads, but they 
do not know how to proceed to accomplish their desires. The 
colleges through their farmers’ institutes and extension lec- 
tures could advise them on these points. Here again the pro- 
gressive young farmer, if he has been instructed in these mat- 
ters while in college, can wield a great influence in his county 
to have the plans for financing and administering the road im- 
provements wisely laid out. 
In many cases where legal authority existed the counties 
have voted for special taxes for road improvement, and have 
then left the work of improvements and maintenance to men 
who were not fitted for this responsibility. Most frequently 
the administration of the road work is intrusted to a board of 
county commissioners, called by varying names in the different 
counties and States. It is a common practice for the county 
to be divided into districts, and for each commissioner to 
supervise the road work in his own district. 
These commissioners are usually elected on account of their 
personal popularity rather than on account of their knowledge 
of road building. If perchance a commissioner should be 
elected who has a talent, he is liable to loose out in the next 
election, just when he is geting used to his work and has 
learned to handle it to the best advantage. 
To get the best results the County Commissioners should em- 
ploy a competent highway engineer to plan and supervise their 
work of road improvement and maintenance. He should be 
selected for his ability to handle the work, and not for 
political reasons, and he should be continued in office as long 
as he continues to faithfully discharge the duties of his office. 
The colleges in teaching road economics should not fail to 
emphasize this point of having a competent highway engineer 
in charge of road improvements; for, according to Mr. Logan 
Waller Page, Director of the Office of Public Roads of the 
United States Department of Agriculture, 50 per cent of the 
enormous amount expended annually on the roads of the 
United States is absolutely wasted.
-P-A-G-E-254

It is not uncommon to see a county grading outfit at work 
trying to cut down a hill where, even with extremely heavy 
cutting, they cannot hope to lighten the gradient enough to 
bring it within a reasonable maximum, and where, if a compe- 
tent engineer were in charge, this part of the road would be 
relocated and a good grade secured at a much smaller cost. 
Under such incompetent management expensive broken stone 
roads are frequently built on such steep grades that the im- 
provement of the surface accomplishes very little towards 
allowing an increase of maximum loads that may be drawn by 
the same teams, and macadam on such grades is very difficult 
to maintain. Such roads must in the future, when the roads 
shall have been placed under intelligent supervision, inevitably 
have these steep grades eliminated, and this can be accom- 
plished only by expensive cutting on the same location or by 
relocating. In either case the expense of the original macadam 
will be a loss, to say nothing of the loss in hauling over the 
road with steep grades till they are finally reduced. 
We also frequently see expensive broken stone being dumped 
upon stretches of wet muddy roads under the direction of a 
commissioner who is ignorant of the principles of road-making, 
and who thinks that he is macadamizing the road. What the 
road needs most at these points is drainage, and if a competent 
engineer were in charge that would be his prescription. 
It should be remembered that a good road is a permanent 
improvement, and it should not be attempted to build it too 
cheaply ; for, if it is built too cheaply, it will fail to accomplish 
its purpose and will have to be rebuilt later when its defects . 
are better realized by the people. If the road is built as it 
should be, it will effect a great saving, will be a great con- 
venience to the traveling public, and will be a great benefit to 
generations yet unborn. In view of the fact that the road is 
a permanent improvement and will be a benefit to future gen- 
erations, the best way to get the money for building good roads 
is for the county to issue bonds and let posterity pay its share 
of the cost. 
Where State aid is available for building good roads, more 
money will be available for work in each county, but the chief 
value of State aid lies in the fact that it will stimulate the 
individual counties to action, and will insure that the roads 
 
-P-A-G-E-255
| JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. 255 
| receiving State aid measure up to the standard of excellence 
| required by the State Highway Engineer, and that they be | 
built under intelligent supervision. | 
Many counties are now attempting to build good roads with | 
the revenues received from their annual taxes. This plan may | 
suffice to build a few miles of good roads in the county each 
year, but it is a very shortsighted policy; for under it every 
property owner in the county will pay the maximum tax rate 
during the balance of his life; and, unless he lives to be as old 
as Mathuselah, the good roads may not reach his community 
during his lifetime. 
In the large industrial communities the people are better 
educated in modern economical business methods than are 
their country cousins, and appreciate better the importance of 
having all important construction work planned and super- 
vised by men specially trained for that particular class of 
work, and it is on this account, as well as on account of the 
fact that there is more money available, that as a rule we see 
better examples of road construction in the larger communities. 
In my own State of Alabama, the counties of Jefferson and 
Montgomery have led the other counties in the work of building 
good roads. Montgomery County undoubtedly has the best 
system of road supervision of any county in the State, and un- 
der the direction of their County Engineer, Mr. J. T. Bullen, 
they have accomplished results that are enthusiastically com- 
mented on by many road experts who have visited that locality 
and looked over their roads. One very notable feature of the 
work in Montgomery is the excellent results that they are able 
to obtain by the statute-labor system. This system of working 
roads is a source of trouble and the cause of very inefficient 
results nearly everywhere it is in use, and any engineer that is 
able to organize a large road force under such a system de- 
serves a great deal of credit, and is capable of overcoming al- 
most any other obstacle with which he will be confronted in 
road building. I do not wish to create the impression that all 
the road work in Montgomery County is done by the statute- 
labor system; for in addition to this system they do work by 
contract, by force account with free laborers and by force ac- 
count with convicts. I simply mention the statute-labor work 
because they have accomplished unusual results with it.

The interest in the good roads movement is spreading so 
rapidly that a great many counties are beginning work along 
the right lines, and from all over the country there are calls 
for competent highway engineers to take charge of highway 
construction. 
The colleges can lend very effectual aid to the cause of good 
roads by supplying trained men to take charge of this rapidly 
growing work of road improvement. 
It has been suggsted that we give short special courses in 
highway engineering for the purpose of preparing men for the 
position of road foremen and county highway engineers, and 
that we admit to these courses men with less preparation than 
is required for the regular engineering courses. I am not in- 
clined to look with favor upon this suggestion, because as a 
civil engineer I am proud of the achievements of my profes- 
sion, and I believe that such a course would tend to lower its 
standard. Work of this kind should be intrusted only to men 
who have not only had special training in this particular 
branch, but who have also had thorough training in the funda- 
mental principles of engineering and in the auxiliary sciences. 
It was suggested that the proposed short course cover two 
years, but I think that two years is entirely inadequate to 
make a competent highway engineer out of a man without pre- 
vious training in mathematics and the auxiliary sciences. A 
man who is unwilling to devote a reasonable time to prepara- 
tion for his life work will, as a rule, do very little credit to his 
profession and to the institution that sends him out. The de- 
mand for highway engineers is now greater than the supply, 
because there has been very little demand for them in the past, 
and the engineering graduates have been turning their atten- 
tion to other branches of engineering. The increased demand 
for men in this work will cause more of our engineering stu- 
dents to prepare for this special field, and it will be only a 
short time till we will be able to fill these places with well 
trained and competent highway engineers, who will do their 
work well, and will reflect credit upon their profession and on 
their alma mater. 
This work of road improvement is of such great importance 
to all the interests of the country that the colleges should join 
hands with those who are working for its advancement, and
-P-A-G-E-257

they can give very effective assistance in the wuys that I have 
suggested, i. e., by aiding in the campaign of educating the 
people to a realization of the need of good roads and by fur- 
nishing trained highway engineers to take charge of the work.
